(Photo: AP/Seth Wenig)\n\nThe first wrongful death lawsuit in America\u2019s vaping crisis begins with a powerful statement which \u2014 in many ways \u2014 serves as a sobering snapshot of the epidemic as a whole. \u201cDaniel David Wakefield was a healthy teenager whose life tragically and prematurely ended due to injuries that were directly caused by his addiction to Juul, an electronic nicotine-delivery system,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cOn August 31, 2018, Wakefield died in his sleep at the age of 18 after years of Juul use.\u201d\n\nFiled by Wakefield\u2019s mother, Lisa Marie Vail, the case may prove to be historic \u2014 the first to demonstrate that e-cigarette and vaping companies may now be vulnerable to legal action from the families of victims. For Juul, one of many companies implicated in the crisis, it\u2019s a problem that could get worse. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,479, individuals have now been diagnosed with EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury) and 33 have died. The condition causes a pneumonia-like illness with symptoms like shortness of breath, coughing, fever and vomiting.\n\nWhile much discussion has focused on vaping products containing THC \u2014 which the majority of those with EVALI have reported using \u2014 the lawsuit is a reminder that e-cigarettes likely also play a role in the illnesses. So what does this latest development mean, and who are the players involved? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nJuul is accused of intentionally making their product \u201cattractive\u201d to teens.\n\nThe complaint levels a multitude of allegations against Juul, saying that the company specifically targeted teens not only through colorful marketing but by characterizing it as a fun and \u201chealthy alternative\u201d to cigarettes. Lawyers write that the company intentionally made its product \u201cattractive and palatable\u201d to younger Americans and nonsmokers through products sold in \u201cyouth-friendly colors and pod flavors that minimize the harsh taste and discomfort of traditional smoking.\u201d\n\nThe result, it alleges, is a spike in use among teenagers \u2014 for whom nicotine has proven most dangerous. Juul, it reads, \u201cshould have known\u201d that their products were \u201cdangerous and defective,\u201d citing research that shows extremely high doses of nicotine in teens to be capable of \u201cpermanently altering the structure of the user\u2019s developing brain,\u201d as well as \u201ccaus[ing] harm to the airways, throat, and lungs.\u201d All of these issues, it says, \u201ccan result in catastrophic, life-altering injuries.\u201d\n\nAt the center of the lawsuit is Daniel David Wakefield, who died at 18.\n\nThe lawsuit goes into depth about 18-year-old Daniel David Wakefield, an \u201cactive healthy teenager\u201d from Florida, who became severely addicted to Juul after being introduced to the product via social media, billboards, and direct marketing to his Gmail. Wakefield, once a student who \u201cexcelled\u201d in school and was in the \u201cgifted, advanced\u201d program since elementary school, experienced a \u201csignificant decline\u201d after starting Juul, which his mother says eventually caused his \u201cemotional well-being\u201d to be \u201csubstantially altered.\u201d Plagued by mood swings and lack of focus, he dropped out of school and opted to take the GED instead. He continued buying the product, despite his mother\u2019s pleas for him to stop, at convenience stores and online.\n\nHis addiction happened quickly, resulting in violence when Juul was removed.\n\nThe teen, according to the complaint, was convinced early on that Juul was not harmful. \u201cWakefield informed his mother that he read materials indicating JUUL was safe and did not pose the health risks that accompany combustible cigarettes,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cHe was unaware of its addictive properties and that it was unsafe for anyone under the age of 26.\u201d The lawsuit says he was \u201cattracted to\u201d the products\u2019 \u201ccandy-like flavors\u201d and sleek design and that his addiction eventually turned violent. \u201c[His mother] recalled an instance where Wakefield became enraged and threw a mini-refrigerator from the top floor of his home because he was angry about not being able to vape.\u201d", "description": "E-cigarette maker Juul was hit with its first wrongful death lawsuit this week involving an 18-year-old in Florida.
