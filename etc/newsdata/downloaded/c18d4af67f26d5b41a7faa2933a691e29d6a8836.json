By 2028, sales of 5G-ready handsets are expected to reach 324.1 million units worldwide.\n\nCNET: Apple fiends still line up for iPhone launches. Good for them\n\n\"As soon as providers better align their early performance claims for 5G with concrete plans, we expect to see 5G phones account for more than half of phone sales in 2023,\" says Ranjit Atwal, senior research director at Gartner. \"As a result of the impact of 5G, the smartphone market is expected to return to growth at 2.9 percent in 2020.\"\n\nPCs, too, are on the decline in the same manner as our standard handsets at present, falling 1.5 percent to 255.7 million units in 2019 in comparison to 259.7 million units in 2018.\n\nGartner expects demand for consumer PCs to drop by 9.8 percent this year, slicing its full share of the total device market to less than 40 percent.\n\nTechRepublic: How to manage notifications in Android 10\n\n\"The collective increase in consumer PC lifetimes will result in 10 million fewer device replacements through 2023,\" Gartner added. \"With the Windows 10 migration peaking, business PCs will decline by 3.9 percent in 2020 after three years of growth.\"\n\nThe device market might not be looking too healthy, but earlier this week, the research agency said that the growth of the social software and collaboration software market will nearly double by 2023.\n\nGartner predicts that the global market for collaboration tools, bolstered by a rise in popularity for social media tools and messaging, will hit $4.8 billion by 2023, an increase from an estimated $2.7 billion in 2018.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
