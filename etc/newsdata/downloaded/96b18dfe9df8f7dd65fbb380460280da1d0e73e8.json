Some people come just for the vibe,\" KK owner Emma Sayle said.\n\nEmma, who is an old school pal of The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton , says the name comes from the popular meme \"every time you masturbate god kills a kitten\".\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: S Meddle/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe company holds parties every month across the country and in Ireland.\n\nIt's website reads: \"You\u2019ll arrive masked at a beautiful London mansion to be met by KK Kittens who will guide you through to the bar area.

Many women have spent their lives looking after their children and their husband\u2019s and they want to do something for themselves and get their confidence back.\n\n\"Our members tend to be high flyers, successful people, the women tend to be independent and free thinking who know just what they want and come to us to get it.\n\n\"Groups of girls come in their 20\u2019s who tend to be more fluid about their sexuality, they don\u2019t seem to care about whether it is a man or woman they are flirting with or having sex with.\n\n\"They don\u2019t seem to judge as much, whether it is a one night stand or whether they want to sleep with a woman. We are seeing more women on women with the younger generations.\n\n\"Some people just like to wander around and enjoy the party, some are complete exhibitionists and like the idea of being watched having sex while others just like to watch.\"\n\nThe next event is on October 19, with tickets for kittens costing \u00a335 and for couples, \u00a3190.", "description": "Emma Sayle, from online community Killing Kittens and an old school pal of Kate Middleton, hosts \"perfect naughty sex parties\" where up to 150 open-minded people live out their wildest fantasies", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Getty Images", "S Meddle Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Manchester Evening News", "Stephen Butler Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20559657.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Masked-Ladies.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
