We won't let them,\" Macron said.\n\nThe two leaders also gave their support for the new \"Green Pact\" sought by incoming Commission president Ursula von der Leyen -- in particular a minimum price for carbon emission rights across the EU.\n\nThey also agreed to back a so-called \"carbon border tax\" long sought by France, which would set higher tariffs on imports made through processes generating large amounts of greenhouse gases.", "description": "France and Germany agreed Wednesday on an accord governing the export of jointly developed weapons and defence equipment, removing a key stumbling block to their development of next-generation tanks and fighter jets.  \"We have finalised a major, legally binding deal on arms exports to fully complete", "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rivet"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bV5Kkiw04zGg9_rXxU1nCA--~B/aD01MTA7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/dc93156872b12e9855c645565b04ad296b781cd8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
