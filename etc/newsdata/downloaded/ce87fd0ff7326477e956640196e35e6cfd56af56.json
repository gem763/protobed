Reuters/Lee Smith\n\nBelgium international Lukaku joined Inter last month, ending a two-year spell at United, which began well, but ended with him battling for a place in the team.\n\nThe 26-year-old has scored two league goals in as many games in Italy and Martinez is confident Lukaku\u2019s bright start to life in the Serie A can translate into success for the national team.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen him free and happy. Going back to many camps, I\u2019ve not seen Rom so focused, so happy, so refreshed by the new challenge,\u201d Martinez told reporters ahead of Monday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier in Scotland.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s now ready to face one of the biggest chapters in his career with the Inter move. He\u2019s driven to be as good as he can for the national team... I\u2019ve been impressed.\u201d\n\nLukaku\u2019s short time in Italy has not been without problems, however, with the striker subjected to racist abuse by Cagliari supporters last week.\n\nBut Martinez said the incident had not affected Lukaku\u2019s mood during international duty.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a difference,\u201d Martinez added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true he was sad with the episode he had to go through, but I\u2019m sure that is something that everyone... will try to help him with, and try to eradicate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no tolerance for that kind of behaviour.\u201d\n\nBelgium are top of Group I, with 15 points after five wins.", "description": "Leaving Manchester United for Inter Milan has reinvigorated Romelu Lukaku and the striker is happy and hungry as he enters an important phase of his playing career, Belgium manager Roberto Martinez has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427849927&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880GS-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
