Confusingly, he had been smiling kilometres from the end, long before the result was certain.\n\nThe smile was not a sign he was having a great time, rather the opposite. He was to trick his body into feeling better as he plunged further into the pain cave than ever before.\n\nIn short, sometimes you smile because your body is producing endorphins \u2013 a hormone that boosts happiness \u2013 but sometimes you produce endorphins if you smile.\n\n\u201cWhen you smile and you\u2019re happy, you can trigger the mind to feel your legs,\u201d Kipchoge once said.\n\nIn Canadian long-distance runner Alex Hutchinson\u2019s book, \ufeffEndure, which explores the physiology and psychology of athletes, he points to an experiment conducted in 1988. Volunteers were made to hold a pen between their teeth. Gripping the pen involved the same muscles used to smile. Those with the pen in their mouth reported finding a cartoon funnier than those who did not. The idea became known as \u201cfacial feedback\u201d, when emotions can be amplified by the physical response.\n\nThe same seems to be true in sport \u2013 weightlifters reported higher levels of perceived effort if they grimaced instead of having a relaxed face.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just your own smile. Hutchinson writes about an experiment where volunteers pedalled on stationary bikes to exhaustion. A screen in front of the athletes flashed images of faces in 16-millisecond bursts. Those who were shown sad faces reached their maximum effort an average of three minutes earlier, and reported higher levels of effort, than those who were shown happy faces, even if they were only seeing them subconsciously.\n\nHong Kong ultra running stalwart John Ellis, who has run and won countless ultra-marathons and never had a DNF (Did Not Finish) in a sport that prides itself on pain endurance, employs the same tactic.\n\nIn the short film \ufeffIs This Fun? about his victory on the 9 Dragons Ultra, he said: \u201cWhen things are tough you should just force yourself to smile. And it just sounds really dumb. You force that smile, but it\u2019s amazing what that does.\u201d\n\nOn \ufeffThe Adventure Trail podcast, Ellis was asked if he knew about all the smile-related studies. He didn\u2019t. It seems he worked out what scientists had been puzzling over since the 1980s.\n\nSo next time you take on a physical challenge, smile like you mean it. And surround yourself with smiling teammates or support groups too. It might be the difference between finishing, dropping out or setting your personal best.", "description": "The Kenyan has a big grin on his face as he pushes human limits, but it\u2019s not because he is enjoying himself \u2013 in fact, it is the opposite", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/14/a0e197f4-ee30-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_114517.jpg?itok=2ZCClYLV&v=1571024722", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
