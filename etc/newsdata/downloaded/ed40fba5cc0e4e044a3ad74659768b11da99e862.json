Easter eggs and a reduced cost to tickets to events.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBut shocked parents were quick to criticise the school on Twitter , with one horrified user called Julie Hare tweeting: \u201cWhat???? I'm so shocked at this!\n\n\"Wellbeing needs to be prioritised by SLT and is not about asking parents to fund staffroom biscuits!\n\n\"It should be about making sure workload is manageable and that staff have time for reflection and cpd. Wow!\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter user @Thatch_Teach said: \u201cNope! Just nope. I don\u2019t want biscuits, I want time to do my job.\n\n\"My mental health would be improved if I had more free time to plan or mark effectively. I don\u2019t need treats, I do need textbooks and resources so raise money for those which could help mental health too!\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nOne parent told The Daily Telegraph : \"As a parent I feel we are setting a terrible example to the students that they need to fund the teachers welfare with biscuits and Easter eggs.\n\n\u201cTeacher welfare isn\u2019t all about food. It feels like there has been a serious misunderstanding in terms of what teacher welfare is all about.\u201d\n\nGeoff Barton, of the Association of School And College Leaders, said that boosting teacher wellbeing would benefit pupils.\n\nThe Mirror has contacted Thorpe Lea Primary School for comment.", "description": "The headteacher has asked parents to fund treats and biscuits in the staff room, vouchers for staff members, Easter eggs and even event tickets", "authors": ["Grace Witherden", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469220.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_051019Slug_2351JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
