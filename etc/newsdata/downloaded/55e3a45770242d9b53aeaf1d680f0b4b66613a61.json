And because we can, we must\".\n\n\"Let us be clear: Yemen cannot wait. And moreover, Yemen need not wait. And neither should we.\"\n\nTwo million suspected cases of the waterborne infection have been recorded by the World Health Organization, while cholera has killed at least 3,500 people, roughly two-thirds of whom were under five years old.\n\nCholera is an intestinal infection caused by eating or drinking products contaminated with bacteria which cause serious dehydration that can prove fatal if left untreated.\n\nAfter parking one of his creations, Rebasi climbs onto a pre-transformation bus without windows and examines the torn leather seats interspersed with mounds of junk.\n\nOn another vehicle, the words \"Taez University\" could still be seen despite the dilapidated state of the bus, complete with a windscreen speckled with bullet holes.\n\n\"We've lost friends, family members. The wars have destroyed everything. If people aren't killed, then they're displaced,\" Rebasi said.\n\nBut he believes that his project shows that \"nothing is impossible, everything can be fixed\".\n\n\"What's important is that people want to do it, to reflect on how they can resolve what the wars have destroyed,\" he said.", "description": "Once a bus wreck peppered with bullet holes, the pristine white water tanker parked in front of a Yemen university now delivers water to students in the war-torn and cholera-hit south.
