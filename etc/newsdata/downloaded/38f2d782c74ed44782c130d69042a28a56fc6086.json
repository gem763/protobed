He will start from the back of the grid,\u201d the Japanese manufacturer said on its F1 Twitter account on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe other three will get five place grid penalties.\u201d\n\nThe move ensures all four cars have fresher engines for Honda\u2019s home race in Japan on Oct. 13, the next round after Russia.\n\nNeither Red Bull-owned team have had drivers finish on the podium in Sochi, a track with both high speed straights and low speed corners.\n\nVerstappen, winner of two races this season, is fourth in the championship but level on points with Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc.\n\nThe pair are both 96 points behind Mercedes\u2019 five-times world champion Lewis Hamilton with six races remaining. Champions Mercedes have won every Russian Grand Prix since the first in 2014.\n\nKvyat is the only Russian driver on the starting grid.\n\nVerstappen started on the back row in last year\u2019s race at Sochi due to engine penalties and was leading after 19 laps, when others pitted, before the 21-year-old Dutchman finished fifth.\n\nThe sport\u2019s youngest race winner, who has now collected an engine penalty for the second time in three races, doubted his drop would be a major setback and looked forward to plenty of passing.\n\n\u201cLast year we started from the back and overtaking didn\u2019t seem like a big problem around here,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the midfield teams are a little bit more competitive this year but, I don\u2019t care, it should be alright.\n\n\u201cYou might lose a little bit of time to the guys ahead but, realistically speaking, you would anyway qualify fourth or fifth, so it\u2019s not going to change a lot.\u201d\n\nFerrari have won the last three races and Sunday\u2019s race looks like being a battle between the Italian team and Mercedes, who are leading both championships.\n\nHamilton is 65 points clear of Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas.", "description": "Max Verstappen will have a five-place grid penalty and Daniil Kvyat will start his home Russian Formula One Grand Prix from the back of the field on Sunday as a result of power unit changes.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434164464&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P18H", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
