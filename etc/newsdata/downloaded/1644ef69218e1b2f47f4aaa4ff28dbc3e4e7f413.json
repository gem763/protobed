REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko/File Photo\n\nThe lack of stability in the Middle East would raise the oil prices but the tariff war between the U.S. and China is likely to have a negative impact on them, Masakazu Toyoda, chairman and chief executive officer of IEEJ, told Reuters in an interview during the Singapore International Energy Week.\n\nHe said oil prices came back down the next day after Brent went above $70 a barrel following the attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities last month.\n\n\u201cMany people are concerned with the economic downturn... Somehow, the balance situation is around $60 a barrel,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Sept. 14 attacks sent Brent to nearly $71.95 on Sept. 16 before it settled at $69.02 on the same day.\n\nBrent is currently trading below $62.\n\nDespite the gloomy economic outlook, Toyoda added that the overall oil consumption in Asia would continue to grow in the next 10 years although demand in Japan and South Korea is falling.\n\nNonetheless, Japan still needs to secure its energy resources given that some 85% of its crude is supplied by the Middle East and some 8-10% from Russia although supplies from the latter may not necessarily be consistent, he said.\n\n\u201cWith respect to security a couple of things are important. First, we have to keep stockpiling. At this moment, we have about 200 days of stockpiling. And as I have said, the consumption is declining, so we can reduce stockpiling but for the moment we don\u2019t reduce stockpiling.\u201d\n\nToyoda added that Japan tries to work closely with (South) Korea, China or the region to have joint stockpiling.\n\nHe added that diversification of energy source could be another option and highlighted the importance of hydrogen as one of the solutions of the future.", "description": "Brent crude prices are expected to be around $60 to $65 a barrel next year as any possible price hikes from geopolitical risks would be countered by ongoing trade war, according to a top executive of the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ).", "authors": ["Seng Li Peng", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446471587&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0L2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
