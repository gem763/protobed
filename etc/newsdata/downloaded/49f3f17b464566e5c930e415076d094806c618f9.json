There's only one problem: It's so short on cash that it doesn't have enough money to pay severance to affected workers, according to The Wall Street Journal's Liz Hoffman and Maureen Farrell.\n\nSo, WeWork, which is believed to be in danger of running out of cash within a month without new financing, has postponed the layoffs, The Journal reported Monday.\n\nA WeWork representative did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe delay could be temporary. WeWork's board is expected to meet Tuesday to consider new funding offers from SoftBank and JPMorgan. Both deals would involve propping up the struggling company with billions of new dollars in additional cash.\n\nWeWork's new co-CEOs told employees in an email last week that the company planned to lay off workers in coming weeks.\n\nRead this: SoftBank is reportedly paying WeWork founder Adam Neumann $1.7 billion to step off the board\n\n\n\nAs reports of imminent layoffs have swirled, severance packages have been a hot topic of conversation inside WeWork. Workers have peppered management with questions around it recently and have focused particularly on what will happen with their outstanding shares in the company, one person familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Employees have also been asking whether their severance package will take into account any stock they are owed.\n\nMany employees were paid partially in shares. Others received WeWork shares when the company acquired their startups. In many cases the shares they received carried a much higher value then than they do now.\n\nSoftBank valued WeWork at $47 billion in a funding round in January. The reported bailouts proposed by it and JPMorgan would place the company's value at $8 billion or less.\n\nGot a tip about WeWork or another company?
