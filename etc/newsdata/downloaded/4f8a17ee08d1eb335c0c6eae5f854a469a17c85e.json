'An inspiration to me and so exciting that he had that huge following that spread out from Manchester.\n\n'Maybe that might happen for me. Would be nice.'\n\nWhether, like Hatton, he will be followed to Las Vegas one day by 30,000 fanatical believers will probably depend on him finding an opponent as high profile as Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao.\n\nWarrington (pictured) was excellent as he managed to defeat Sofiane Takoucht in two rounds\n\nMeanwhile promoter Frank Warren, who also piloted Hatton to glory, is reaching out to the wearers of other alphabelts for Warrington to add to his IBF title.\n\nFirst up is likely to be Chinese sensation Xu Can, the WBA regular champion, at the Elland Road home of Warrington's beloved Leeds United.\n\nXu defends that title against Manny Robles next month but Warren says: 'We are already in discussions with him and assuming he wins that one we could fill the football ground here in May.'\n\nBeyond that US Olympian Shakur Stevenson, who bids for the vacant WBO title on Saturday week, says he will only stay down at featherweight 'if I can get a unification fight with Josh.'\n\nMoving up to super-featherweight is also an option for Warrington now that Leo Santa Cruz, who had those two epic battles with Carl Frampton, has done the same.\n\nWarrington has been itching to get his fists on rival champions - 'I'll fight anyone with a belt' - but the hell he inflicted on Takouche may discourage even the best of them from sharing a ring with him.\n\nJosh Warrington is to Leeds what Ricky Hatton was to Manchester and he deserves praise\n\nHe came to the ring through the strident sounds of a military pipes and drum band and was a lethal weapon from the first bell. It is too simplistic to dismiss Takouche as a pushover. This was a former European champion on a 15-win streak but he was blown away by an electrifying storm of punches.\n\nThe Frenchman came to Warrington's dressing room to tell him: 'Yes, you really are the best featherweight in the world.' Warren goes further, saying: 'Josh can grow into one of the greatest of all British fighters.' Greater than Hatton?\n\n'Listen,' says Warren. 'I love Ricky, too. We had magical times together and he was an amazing fighter. But he did go off enjoying himself between fights. With Josh we have similar excitement but in a totally dedicated boxer.'\n\nAt which Warrington chuckles and says: 'Once we've done our thing here a few times and then gone on our travels to Vegas, then I can party like Ricky.'\n\nNow he has learned his lesson from cutting a few corners in preparation for that ugly, close fight with Kid Galahad, there appears to be no limit on what he might achieve.\n\nCan Xu do anything to derail this express train to greatness? No, Xu Can't. But it will be fun finding out in Leeds. And it's time for Britain as a whole to get on board.", "description": "Josh Warrington is to Leeds what Ricky Hatton was to Manchester and the time has come for the wider public to reach out and embrace the best featherweight on Planet Boxing.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/20/19663326-0-image-a-11_1570994093061.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
