(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTop Democratic leaders pushed President Trump and Senate Republicans on Monday to take swift action on gun legislation at their first appearance at the end of a congressional recess, seeking to channel public frustration into action after another series of mass shootings.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) focused their attention at a Capitol Hill news conference on legislation, already passed in the House, that would expand the federal background check system to cover more gun sales, including those between private individuals rather than a gun dealer.\n\n\u201cThe legislation is the quickest way to make a law that will save American lives,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s right at the intersection of what is really effective and what can pass.\u201d\n\n[Americans of both parties overwhelmingly support \u2018red flag\u2019 laws, expanded background checks for gun buyers, Washington Post-ABC News poll finds]\n\nPelosi and Schumer were joined by other leaders who saw their communities affected by the recent mass shootings \u2014 Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Tex.), who represents El Paso; Nan Whaley, the Democratic mayor of Dayton, Ohio; and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).\n\nAll three said they were frustrated with inaction on the gun issue in the face of public demands for action \u2014 and in some cases, overwhelming public support for some of the legislation they are proposing.\n\nA new Washington Post-ABC News poll released Monday finds overwhelming support across partisan and ideological lines for the expansion of background checks, as well as the establishment of \u201cred flag\u201d laws allowing law enforcement, at a judge\u2019s discretion, to temporarily seize guns from troubled individuals. More than 80 percent of Americans support each policy.\n\n\u201cWhat I kept hearing over and over and over again from El Pasoans was, why?\u201d Escobar said, recounting conversations she has had since a gunman left 22 people dead in a Walmart there Aug. 3. \u201cI\u2019ve had constituents ask me what it\u2019s going to take for Mitch McConnell to see the blood that we saw spilled in our community and to feel the torturous pain that we have felt . . . and it is a very difficult question to answer.\u201d\n\nWhaley said before embarking for Washington, she had gotten a text message from the mother of Monica Brickhouse, a victim of the Aug. 4 shooting in her city that left nine dead. The mom\u2019s message: \u201cGo get \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want us to do something, and so that\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything else that 9 out of 10 Americans agree on.\u201d\n\nMcConnell did not address gun legislation Monday in his first remarks on the Senate floor, instead discussing government funding and presidential nominations. In an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt last week, he said he is looking to Trump to weigh in first before endorsing any legislation responding to the violence.\n\n\u201cIf the president is in favor . . . and I know that if we pass it, it\u2019ll become law,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll put it on the floor.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has embraced an epithet frequently used by his political opponents, the \u201cGrim Reaper,\u201d referring to his determination to sideline left-leaning legislation passed by the House and supported by Democrats. But in this case, the polling indicates, it might not only be Democratic voters McConnell is alienating.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has yet to solidly endorse any response to the string of shootings \u2014 which, besides the El Paso and Dayton tragedies, include mass killings in Gilroy, Calif., on July 28, and Midland and Odessa, Tex., on Aug. 31. He has promised to deliver a package of proposals but has offered no firm timeline for doing so.\n\nThe president has publicly played down the potential for the expansion of background checks, explaining that he would rather focus any legislation on those with mental illnesses.\n\n[Trump tells NRA chief that universal background checks are off the table]\n\nPelosi and Schumer said Monday that would not be sufficient, calling universal background checks a necessary precursor to any further legislation aimed at addressing the spate of tragedies.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday is set to advance other gun-related bills \u2014 including legislation encouraging states to pass red-flag laws and a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines \u2014 but support for those bills tends to be more partisan. Top party leaders have instead kept the focus on background checks, hoping to overcome opposition from the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups that say it would be an infringement of the Second Amendment to require private sellers to seek federal screening for their buyers.\n\n\u201cWe are once again asking the Grim Reaper, informing the Grim Reaper, that these bills are alive and well in the public \u2014 that public opinion, public sentiment will weigh in,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe will make this issue too hot for him to handle.\u201d\n\nBut there were indications Monday that any hope of bipartisan compromise \u2014 essential in a divided Congress \u2014 might be fleeting. One Democratic senator who had been engaged with the White House in negotiating possible gun legislation \u2014 and expressed a degree of optimism about those talks late last month \u2014 issued a pessimistic statement Monday.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he was \u201cstill negotiating in good faith\u201d to expand background checks to more gun transactions. \u201cBut as each day goes by, it seems more likely that we\u2019re going to find ourselves back in a familiar place where 90 percent of the Americans who want more background checks are going to be disappointed once again,\u201d he said.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E.
