Paris Hilton, one of Barron Hilton\u2019s grandchildren, became a reality-television star and tabloid sensation.\n\nBarron Hilton, by contrast, preferred duck hunting to high society. He married his childhood sweetheart, Marilyn Hawley. They had eight children and remained married when she died in 2004.\n\nOwning the Chargers was one of his few public indulgences. \u201cThe happiest days of my life were the days I was involved with the Chargers,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times in 2009. During that period, he helped negotiate the merger of the AFL and the National Football League.\n\nHe sold a controlling stake in the Chargers for $10 million to focus on his duties at Hilton Hotels in 1966, when he succeeded his father as chief executive.\n\nBarron Hilton, top right, in 1966 with Colorado\u2019s then Gov.

Weeks before the casino\u2019s opening, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission rejected Hilton\u2019s licensing application. Hilton sold the property to Donald Trump.\n\nConrad Hilton, who died in 1979, left nearly all his fortune, including a 28% stake in Hilton Hotels, to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, assigning it to charity with certain conditions. \u201cThere is a natural law, a Divine law, that obliges you and me to relieve the suffering, the distressed and the destitute,\u201d the elder Mr. Hilton wrote in the 33rd and final version of his will.\n\nHolding only a 3.4% stake in the company, Barron Hilton embarked on a 10-year legal battle to secure control. He argued that his father didn\u2019t want the company sold to outsiders and that the will granted him an option to acquire the 28% stake for about $165 million.\n\nThat claim sparked a series of lawsuits, eventually involving the Roman Catholic Church and several orders of nuns, which stood to benefit as charities.\n\nA 1989 settlement gave Mr. Hilton control of the company. \u201cHilton vs. the nuns was not the best public relations move,\u201d he later told USA Today.\n\nIn 1996, he recruited Stephen F. Bollenbach, a financial wizard who had worked at Walt Disney Co. , to succeed him as CEO of Hilton Hotels.\n\nBlackstone Group LP acquired the hotel company for $20 billion in 2007. Mr. Hilton also announced that he would leave 97% of his wealth to the foundation, a gift projected to increase its endowment to $6.3 billion from $2.9 billion.\n\nBlackstone Group acquired Hilton Hotels Corp. in 2007 for $20 billion; Barron Hilton in 2010.

In his teenage years, he parked cars for hotel guests at the Town House in Los Angeles.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 17 and was stationed in Pearl Harbor, where he worked in a photo lab making I.D. cards for servicemen.\n\nWhile in the Navy and later at the University of Southern California, he trained as a pilot. He eventually amassed his own small air force\u2014including an acrobatic biplane, a Beechcraft Staggerwing, four gliders and a hot-air balloon\u2014at his 460,000-acre Nevada ranch.\n\nMr. Hilton is survived by eight children, 15 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\nWrite to James R.
