Points Of View is an entertainment programme with a long history and is a household name with the public.\n\n'Newswatch - while an important programme - isn't. Samira was paid the same as her male predecessor when she began presenting Newswatch.\n\n'Gender has not been a factor in levels of pay for Points Of View. News and entertainment are very different markets and pay across the media industry reflects this.'\n\nThe hearing, to be held at the Central London Employment Tribunal, is listed to last for seven days.", "description": "The Radio 4 presenter (pictured today) is taking the BBC to an employment tribunal regarding alleged 'failure to provide equal pay for equal value work', according to court documents.", "authors": ["Alexander Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20276688-0-image-a-28_1572263005583.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
