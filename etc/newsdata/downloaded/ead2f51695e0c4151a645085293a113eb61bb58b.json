The move which came after the Bombay High Court dismissed all petitions against the felling of over 2,500 trees in Aarey for a metro depot attracted the ire of environment activists who thronged Aarey colony in large numbers to register their protest.\n\nBut the imposition of Section 144 of the IPC gave the MMRC a free pass to carry out the assault whereas 29 protesting citizens were detained.\n\nAs the Supreme Court orders hit the headlines early Monday morning, netizens found themselves caught in a strange fix as they could not decide whether to celebrate or express regret as the damage had already been done.\n\nDon't Miss 1.2 K SHARES 509 SHARES 248 SHARES\n\nPeople from several walks of life, including celebrities and key figures from political and sports arenas, along with common people, took to Twitter to express their dismay.\n\n\u201cOperation Successful -Patient Dead\u201d Sum & Substance of today\u2019s Supreme Court hearing on #Aarey \u2014 Jaiveer Shergill (@JaiveerShergill) October 7, 2019\n\nCongratulations on proving mahaul of rich like you is more important than lives of ordinary Mumbaikar. Know you have blood of ordinary people (dying in overcrowded locals ) on your hands! \u2014 mayurwrites (@freentglty) October 7, 2019\n\nThe Aarey Activist and protestors lost today irrespective of the stay order and any future decision by the SC. This statement by the Solicitor General is the answer to why trees were chopped down in the middle of the night.#AareyForest #AareyKillerDevendra https://t.co/UE5is7lOwI \u2014 Rohit Kumar Singh \u26a1\ufe0f (@ks_rohit10) October 7, 2019\n\nSC directive on Aarey forest is a great victory for protesters. But the govt says whatever trees were to be cut has already cut. #AareyForest \u2014 Rabi Das (@RabiDasOdisha) October 7, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nI see no point in the joy. The damage has already been done, most of the #AareyForest trees have been felled by the time SC interfered. Too late. #aarey \u2014 Asheem PK (@peekeymon) October 7, 2019\n\nMa'am damage is already done by cutting trees. Authorities have taken fast action during Court holidays. \u2014 CA Ramchandra Mahuli (@rammahuli) October 7, 2019\n\nThe court had convened special sitting by converting a representation by a group of law students into a Public Interest Litigation. In the meanwhile, Section 144 was lifted in the run up to the urgent hearing of the case but was imposed once again.", "description": "After reeling cries over the past two days by pro-environment groups and concerned citizens who protested against the felling of trees in Mumbai\u2019s Aarey Colony, the Supreme Court on Monday ordered that no more trees should be cut while also recording an undertaking by the Maharashtra government to assure the same.", "authors": ["Saket Suman"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/aarey_1570442812_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
