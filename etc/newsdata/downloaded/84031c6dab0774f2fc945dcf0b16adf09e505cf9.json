Organic bread was the worst green house gas emitter as it produced a much lower yield while the difference in emissions for conventionally farmed and organic vegetables was small (stock image)\n\nMore farmland in other countries would need to be made available, where food would be grown and then imported \u2013 meaning almost double the emissions would be released.\n\nWHAT IS ORGANIC FARMING? Organic farming does not use chemical fertilisers on crops or feed additives for livestock. It relies on natural forms of farming such as biological pest control and crop rotation. Organic farming is less efficient so costs more to produce.\n\nLaurence Smith, at the Royal Agricultural University in the UK who carried out the analysis, told the New Scientist: 'The key message from my perspective is that you can't really have your cake and eat it.'\n\nAdding: 'There are a lot of benefits to the organic approach'.\n\nThe analysis details how the only way to reduce emissions from farming land, is to farm lesser amounts of land.\n\nIt states that farming and 'changes in land use' such as cutting down forests to make way for farming is the cause of a third of all greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMr Smith found that for every unit of food emissions are 20 per cent lower in organic crops and four per cent lower for animal products farmed organically.\n\nThis however is outweighed by the fact organic farming requires around 1.5 times as much land to produce the same yield as conventional farms (in crops such as barley and wheat).\n\nMr Smith says that despite organic farming's greenhouse gas problem people shouldn't stop eating organic (stock image)\n\nIf half of this extra land needed for organic was sourced from grass lands the increase in green house emissions would be around 20 percent.\n\nBut if that grass land would otherwise have been 'reforested' emissions could almost double that of conventional farming.\n\nHOW DOES EATING MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS HURT THE ENVIRONMENT? Eating meat, eggs and dairy products hurts the environment in a number of different ways. Cows, pigs and other farm animals release huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere. While there is less methane in the atmosphere than other greenhouse gases, it is around 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Raising livestock also means converting forests into agricultural land, meaning CO2-absorbing trees are being cut down, further adding to climate change. More trees are cut down to convert land for crop growing, as around a third of all grain produced in the world is used to feed animals raised for human consumption. Factory farms and crop growing also requires massive amounts of water, with 542 litres of water being used to produce just a single chicken breast. As well as this, the nitrogen-based fertiliser used on crops adds to nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide is around 300 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere. These fertilisers can also end up in rivers, further adding to pollution. Overall, studies have shown that going vegetarian can reduce your carbon emissions from food by half. Going vegan can reduce this further still.\n\nMr Smith says that despite organic farming's greenhouse gas problem people shouldn't stop eating organic.\n\nHe says people may chose to eat organic to reduce pesticides used on the land or in order to 'help' wildlife.\n\nContrary to belief the study found that biodiversity would be harmed by the blanket introduction of organic farming as it would mean more natural habitats taken over for farming land.\n\nRob Percival at the Soil Association, which certifies organic farms in the UK, told the New Scientist that the study was 'untenable' for not considering a change in diet.\n\nHe said: 'Dietary change will benefit the public's health and free up land, making an organic scenario entirely feasible.'\n\nIn order to feed the predicted 9.8 billion people on Earth in 2050, the world will need to produce 56 per cent more food compared to 2010.\n\nIf the level of meat and dairy consumption rises in line with current food habits, six million square kilometres (2.3 million square miles) of forests would need to be converted to agriculture - an area twice the size of India.\n\nJohan Rockstrom, former director of the Potsdam Institute of Climate Change Impact Research, said: 'To have any chance of feeding ten billion people in 2050 within planetary boundaries, we must adopt a healthy, plant-based diet, cut food waste, and invest in technologies that reduce environmental impacts.'\n\nOverall, studies have shown that going vegetarian can reduce your carbon emissions from food by half. Going vegan can reduce this further still.\n\nMr Smith believes there is another way to combat the struggles of environmentally friendly food production - combining the best of organic with conventional methods to increase efficiencies whilst retaining ethical principles.\n\nHe also states that allowing gene-edited crops to be labelled 'organic' would increase yield.\n\nHowever authors concluded that the only way to successfully create a 100 per cent organic diet that did not cause a spike greenhouse gas emissions would with 'widespread changes to the national diet'.\n\nThe study was published in the Nature Communications.", "description": "The increase in the need for imported food caused by a national switch to organic farming would mean higher levels of polluting gases coming from farms in England and Wales.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/10/20076488-0-image-a-4_1571823948597.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
