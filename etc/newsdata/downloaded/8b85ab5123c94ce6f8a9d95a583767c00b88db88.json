The layoffs have been delayed from earlier this month, however, because the company struggled to afford the severance costs, according to reports.\n\nThe funding from SoftBank marks a major fall from grace for WeWork, once a darling of Silicon Valley and valued at as much as $47bn earlier this year.\n\nThe company, which rents out office space, abandoned its high-profile plans to list its shares after investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and its governance.", "description": "WeWork's ousted founder Adam Neumann will be paid $185m (\u00a3143m) as part of a deal to leave the company after the office space firm in a rescue from SoftBank.", "authors": ["James Cook", "Michael O'Dwyer", "James Titcomb", "Robin Pagnamenta"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/08/15/TELEMMGLPICT000206429197-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
