The situation escalated following the Sept. 13 revelation of an intelligence community whistleblower complaint reportedly related to a \u201cseries of events\u201d including a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAs these events unfold, the aim of the chronology below is to provide a useful reference for the context and timeline on Ukraine, the roles of Joe Biden and his son Hunter there, and Trump and Giuliani\u2019s efforts to persuade Ukraine to pursue investigations against them. We attempt to present an accurate picture of events, favorable and unfavorable to the players involved. Our assessments and views of the available public information are reflected in two pieces: Viola Gienger\u2019s \u201cTrump and Giuliani\u2019s Quest for Fake Ukraine \u2018Dirt\u2019 on Biden: An Explainer\u201d and our forthcoming, \u201cThe Swiftboating of Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThis chronology will be updated as new information becomes available.\n\nNovember 2013 \u2013 Political revolution in Ukraine\n\nTens of thousands of Ukrainians begin protests in central Kyiv\u2019s Independence Square (the \u201cMaidan\u201d) against the government of then-President Viktor Yanukovych. The protesters\u2019 main concern is the government\u2019s decision to abandon a planned \u201cassociation agreement\u201d with the European Union and to instead accept assistance from Russia. The protests grew to encompass broader concerns, especially about rampant corruption in Ukraine. The movement became known as the \u201cMaidan Revolution\u201d or the \u201cRevolution of Dignity,\u201d referring to the daily indignities Ukrainians suffered as a result of government corruption and ineptitude.\n\nFebruary 2014 \u2013 Pro-Russian government falls\n\nYanukovych\u2019s security forces crack down on the demonstrators, killing more than 70 civilians and spurring a political backlash. The president, who had been in office since February 2010, flees to Russia.\n\nMarch 2014 \u2013 Russian military invasion\n\nRussian forces invade Crimea and stage an illegal and dubious referendum and declare their annexation of the peninsula. That month, the United Nations General Assembly votes to condemn Russian actions, including the referendum.\n\nApril 2014 \u2013 Russian and pro-Russian forces invade the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine and take control, starting a war that continues today and has killed more than 13,000 people.\n\nApril 2014 \u2013 Hunter Biden joins Ukrainian firm Burisma\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s younger son, Hunter Biden, joins the board of Burisma Holdings, the largest private oil and gas extracting company in Ukraine, controlled by founder Mykola Zlochevskiy, who had served as a Cabinet minister under former pro-Russian Presidents Leonid Kuchma and Yanukovych. Both administrations had been suspected of corruption, and once they were ousted, successor administrations pledging reforms targeted previous officials, including Zlochevskiy, for investigation. Allegations against Zlochevskiy center on the funding schemes he used to form the company in 2002. But cases against him stall in each instance.\n\nAn American business partner of Hunter Biden, Devon Archer, also joins the board. The company issues a press release about the Biden appointment in May (see below). The appointment draws criticism for the potential perception of a conflict of interest with Vice President Biden\u2019s role as the White House\u2019s point man on Ukraine. News reports later in 2014 reveal that Hunter Biden had been discharged from the Navy in February for testing positive for cocaine (clearly just months before the Burisma board appointment).\n\nApril 16, 2014 \u2013 U.K. investigates Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevskiy\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Serious Fraud Office blocks accounts of Burisma\u2019s majority shareholder, Mykola Zlochevskiy. A British court conducts a hearing on Dec. 3-5, 2014, and unblocks the accounts in a Jan. 21, 2015 judgment, (full text), finding that none of the evidence \u201cestablishes reasonable grounds for a belief that his assets were unlawfully acquired as a result of misconduct in public office.\u201d (In September 2015, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt heavily criticizes the Office of Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin in a public speech for not cooperating sufficiently with and even undermining the British investigation. See below.)\n\nMay 12, 2014 \u2013 Burisma Holdings issues a press release saying Hunter Biden has joined its board, and that he will be \u201cin charge of the Holdings\u2019 legal unit and will provide support for the company among international organizations.\u201d The release cites his then-current positions as counsel to New York-based law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP and co-founder and a managing partner of investment advisory firm Rosemont Seneca Partners, where he also served as board chairman.\n\nMay 25, 2014 \u2013 Chocolate and confectionary magnate/oligarch Petro Poroshenko wins the presidency in Ukraine in an election to succeed Yanukovych on a platform of turning Ukraine back to the West. Poroshenko previously had served as foreign minister and minister of trade and economic development.\n\nJune 7, 2014 \u2013 Petro Poroshenko takes office as president of Ukraine.\n\nJune 19, 2014 \u2013 The Ukrainian Parliament approves Poroshenko\u2019s appointment of former law enforcement officer and member of Parliament Vitaly Yarema as prosecutor general.\n\nAug. 5, 2014 \u2013 Ukraine investigation of Burisma\n\nUkrainian Prosecutor General Vitaly Yarema opens an investigation of Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevskiy on suspicion of \u201cunlawful enrichment.\u201d (The investigation is referenced in the January 2015 U.K. court judgment, which concludes that the Ukrainian probe might have been started as a result of a misinterpretation of the British account freeze.) Zlochevskiy\u2019s American lawyer, John Buretta, a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, says in a 2017 Q&A on the Burisma website that a court in Kyiv ordered the case closed in September 2016 because no evidence of wrongdoing had been presented. While suspicions remain over how Zlochevskiy obtained his wealth and what happened to taxpayer money while he held public office, the British judge in the January 2015 U.K. judgment observed, \u201cAllegations of corruption against political opponents appear to have been a feature of Ukrainian political life at this time.\u201d\n\nOct. 14, 2014 \u2013 Ramping up Ukraine anti-corruption forces\n\nUkraine\u2019s Parliament passes a law establishing the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), a priority of anti-corruption campaigners who\u2019d helped lead the revolution and of the U.S. government (led by Biden) and other international backers of Ukraine. The bureau, which is to include a special prosecutor for certain corruption cases, was created in part because of the recognized ineffectiveness and corruption of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office and the country\u2019s judiciary. The country\u2019s anti-corruption plans also include a special High Anti-Corruption Court, which Poroshenko and Parliament slow-rolled until domestic and foreign advocates again exerted pressure over the past year. In fact, the U.S. and Europe required the Ukrainian government to fund NABU in exchange for financial aid. NABU\u2019s early years are an uphill battle in the face of documented efforts by Parliament and the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office to undermine its work.\n\nNABU later becomes a target of Giuliani\u2019s (see Aug. 14, 2016 item below).\n\nFeb. 10, 2015 \u2013 Viktor Shokin takes office as Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, replacing Yarema.\n\nSept. 24, 2015 \u2013 U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt excoriates Prosecutor General Shokin\u2019s office for stymying anti-corruption investigations, including those involving Burisma\n\nPyatt\u2019s speech was part of a regular drumbeat by U.S. and other Western leaders, including Vice President Biden, and a swath of Ukrainian civil society seeking to pressure President Poroshenko to force his officials, especially in the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office (PGO) to crack down more, not less, on corruption. \u201cCorruption kills,\u201d Pyatt said in the address to the Odesa Financial Forum for business leaders. \u201cIt kills productivity and smothers inspiration. Ideas are lost in its shadow. Innovation and entrepreneurship lag under the weight of bribery, back room dealing, and bullying.\u201d\n\nWhile giving Shokin a last chance to shape up (Pyatt says, \u201cWe want to work with Prosecutor General Shokin so the PGO is leading the fight against corruption.\u201d), the ambassador criticizes \u201cofficials at the PGO\u2019s office\u201d for not providing documents that were needed for the British investigation of Burisma owner Zlochevskiy and effectively allowing Zlochevskiy to transfer $23 million of what Pyatt says were Ukrainian taxpayer assets to Cyprus. In other words, Pyatt is critical of the prosecutor\u2019s office for not aiding in investigations of Burisma\u2019s owner, which was in line with Biden\u2019s criticism that the office was blocking corruption investigations. Pyatt specifically called for the investigation and removal of officials who were involved in the failure to help the British authorities investigate Zlochevskiy:\n\n\u201cWe have learned that there have been times that the PGO not only did not support investigations into corruption, but rather undermined prosecutors working on legitimate corruption cases. For example, in the case of former Ecology Minister Mykola Zlochevsky [cq], the U.K. authorities had seized 23 million dollars in illicit assets that belonged to the Ukrainian people. Officials at the PGO\u2019s office were asked by the U.K to send documents supporting the seizure. Instead they sent letters to Zlochevsky\u2019s attorneys attesting that there was no case against him. As a result, the money was freed by the U.K. court and shortly thereafter the money was moved to Cyprus. The misconduct by the PGO officials who wrote those letters should be investigated, and those responsible for subverting the case by authorizing those letters should \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 be summarily terminated.\u201d\n\nFull text of Ambassador Pyatt\u2019s speech.\n\nOct. 8, 2015 \u2013 U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland continues the drumbeat on the need for stepped-up anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in testimony that \u201cthe Prosecutor General\u2019s Office (PGO) has to be reinvented as an institution that serves the citizens of Ukraine, rather than ripping them off.\u201d She continues, \u201cThat means it must investigate and successfully prosecute corruption and asset recovery cases, including locking up dirty personnel in the PGO itself.\u201d\n\nFall 2015 \u2013 Biden, along with the EU, publicly calls for ouster of Prosecutor General Shokin for failure to work on anti-corruption efforts.\n\nJohn E. Herbst, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush, later testified before Congress:\n\n\u201cBy late fall of 2015, the EU and the United States joined the chorus of those seeking Mr. Shokin\u2019s removal as the start of an overall reform of the Procurator General\u2019s Office. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden spoke publicly about this before and during his December visit to Kyiv.\u201d\n\nDec. 8, 2015 \u2013 Vice President Biden makes a speech to Ukraine\u2019s Parliament urging the country to step up anti-corruption measures.\n\nIn a speech covered widely in news media, Biden implores Ukrainian lawmakers to move more quickly to fight the country\u2019s \u201chistoric battle against corruption\u201d and \u201cmake real the Revolution of Dignity.\u201d (Many of the lawmakers themselves were former businessmen and suspected of corruption and therefore that much less interested in fighting graft.) He says, \u201cThe only thing worse than having no hope at all is having hopes rise and see them dashed repeatedly on the shoals of corruption\u2026Not enough has been done yet.\u201d Specifically citing Shokin\u2019s Office of the General Prosecutor for lagging on corruption investigations, he continues:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to set up a new anti-corruption bureau and establish a special prosecutor fighting corruption. The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform. The judiciary should be overhauled. The energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles \u2014 not sweetheart deals. It\u2019s not enough to push through laws to increase transparency with regard to official sources of income. Senior elected officials have to remove all conflicts between their business interest and their government responsibilities. Every other democracy in the world \u2014 that system pertains. Oligarchs and non-oligarchs must play by the same rules. They have to pay their taxes, settle their disputes in court \u2014 not by bullying judges. That\u2019s basic. That\u2019s how nations succeed in the 21st century. Corruption siphons away resources from the people. It blunts the economic growth, and it affronts the human dignity. We know that. You know that. The Ukrainian people know that. When Russia seeks to use corruption as a tool of coercion, reform isn\u2019t just good governance, it\u2019s self-preservation. It\u2019s in the national security interest of the nation \u2026. The United States is with you in this fight\u2026We\u2019ve stepped up with official assistance to help backstop the Ukrainian economy. We\u2019ve rallied the international community to commit a total of $25 billion in bilateral and multilateral financing to support Ukraine. It includes $2 billion in U.S. loan guarantees and the possibility of more. Yesterday I announced almost $190 million in new American assistance to help Ukraine fight corruption, strengthen the rule of law, implement critical reform, bolster civil society, advance energy security. That brings our total of direct aid to almost $760 million in direct assistance, in addition to loan guarantees since this crisis broke out. And that is not the end of what we\u2019re prepared to do if you keep moving. But for Ukraine to continue to make progress and to keep the support of the international community you have to do more, as well. The big part of moving forward with your IMF program \u2014 it requires difficult reforms.\u201d\n\nFull text of Biden\u2019s speech.\n\nJan. 21, 2016 \u2013 Vice President Biden meets with Ukrainian President Poroshenko and discusses \u201cthe need to continue to move forward on Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption agenda,\u201d according to a readout on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.\n\nFeb. 11, 2016 \u2013 Vice President Biden speaks with Poroshenko by phone. A U.S. Embassy statement said the two agreed \u201cthat it is essential for Ukraine to continue to take action to root out corruption and implement reforms.\u201d\n\nBiden later boasts about the pressure he exerted on Ukraine during that time to address corruption. In a Jan. 23, 2018, Q&A following a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in Washington, Biden touts his tough stance with Ukraine in 2016. He says he told Ukrainian leaders that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless they fired Prosecutor General Shokin. President Trump and Rudy Giuliani have cited that boast repeatedly as proof that Biden admitted pushing for Shokin\u2019s firing, even though Biden was calling for the prosecutor to be fired because he wasn\u2019t pursuing corruption cases vigorously enough. In the CFR appearance, Biden makes the comments in the context of expressing his concern that Ukraine still was not getting tough enough on corruption. \u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d Biden continued, \u201cSo they made some genuine substantial changes institutionally and with people. But \u2026 there\u2019s now some backsliding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States and other Western nations had for months called for the ousting of Mr. Shokin, who was widely criticized for turning a blind eye to corrupt practice,\u201d the New York Times reported at the time.\n\nSteven Pifer is a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs under President George W. Bush. He told PolitiFact that \u201cvirtually everyone\u201d he knew in the U.S. government \u201cfelt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired. As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office.\u201d\n\nNote: Investigation of Burisma laid dormant at the time\n\nVitaliy Kasko, a former deputy prosecutor general who had worked under Shokin and resigned in frustration at his stymying of corruption investigations, told Bloomberg News (in a May 2019 interview) that the office\u2019s probe into Burisma Holdings had been long dormant by the time Joe Biden issued his ultimatum in 2016. \u201cThere was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against\u201d Burisma owner Zlochevskiy, Bloomberg quoted Kasko as saying. \u201cIt was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,\u201d Kasko said.\n\n\u201cShokin was not investigating. He didn\u2019t want to investigate Burisma,\u201d Daria Kaleniuk a leading Ukrainian anti-corruption advocate, told the Washington Post. \u201cAnd Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.\u201d\n\nSee also entries above: At time of British investigation in 2014-2015, Shokin\u2019s Office sent letters to Zlochevsky\u2019s attorneys attesting that there was no case against him.\n\nFeb. 16, 2016 \u2013 Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin resigns, then returns to office before finally being ousted\n\nUkrainian news media report on Feb. 16 that Viktor Shokin resigned as Prosecutor General after months of intense criticism for failing to adequately pursue any major corruption cases. But wait \u2026 despite President Poroshenko\u2019s public call that day that Shokin resign and the apparent submission of a resignation letter on Feb. 19, media cited a prosecutor in Shokin\u2019s office on March 16 saying the chief prosecutor was back after a \u201clong leave.\u201d Finally, on March 29, the Parliament voted overwhelmingly to approve Poroshenko\u2019s recommendation to dismiss Shokin.\n\nThe European Union issued a statement hailing his departure. The respected English-language Kyiv Post writes, \u201cBy the end of his term, he was likely one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine, having earned a bad reputation for inaction and obstructing top cases.\u201d The paper also says it \u201cwasn\u2019t able to find any public comments that Shokin made about [Burisma] during his 14 months in office.\u201d\n\nFeb. 18 and 19, 2016 \u2013 Vice President Biden speaks by phone with Ukrainian President Poroshenko. The Feb. 19 U.S. Embassy statement says Biden again urged the Ukrainian leader to \u201cto accelerate Ukraine\u2019s efforts to fight corruption, strengthen justice and the rule of law, and fulfill its IMF requirements.\u201d\n\nApril 14, 2016 \u2013 Vice President Biden speaks with Ukrainian President Poroshenko by phone, emphasizing \u201cthe urgency of putting in place a new Prosecutor General who would bolster the agency\u2019s anti-corruption efforts and strongly support the work of its reformers.\u201d Biden does the same in a call the same day with newly elected Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman.\n\nMay 12, 2016 \u2013 A new General Prosecutor\n\nYuriy Lutsenko, who had headed Poroshenko\u2019s political bloc in Parliament, takes office as prosecutor general, after Parliament changed the law to allow someone without a law degree and legal experience to hold the position. According to the New York Times, \u201cLutsenko initially took a hard line against Burisma.\u201d\n\nAug. 14, 2016 \u2013 Evidence surfaces of payments to Paul Manafort\n\nPaul Manafort by this time was Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, and the evidence appeared to show off-the-books payments by the discredited, pro-Russian former Ukrainian President Yanukovych when Manafort served as his political consultant. The payments were recorded in a \u201cblack ledger\u201d of Yanukovych\u2019s political party that was turned over to Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU). On Aug. 19, 2016, days after the New York Times reported the story, Serhiy Leshchenko, a member of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament who had been swept into office with the 2014 revolution, holds a news conference to discuss the ledger and criticize the payments to Manafort.\n\nRudy Giuliani has cited the revelations as evidence that certain Ukrainians, supported by the Obama administration at the time, were colluding with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to reveal information tainting Manafort and, by association, Trump, in order to influence the election. Giuliani in May 2019 accused Leshchenko personally on Fox News of colluding with Democrats.\n\nSept. 2016 \u2013 Case against Burisma closed\n\nIn a 2017 Q&A on the Burisma website, Zlochevskiy\u2019s American lawyer, John Buretta, a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, says that a court in Kyiv ordered a case closed in September 2016 because no evidence of wrongdoing had been presented.\n\nJune 8, 2017 \u2013 Giuliani meets with Ukrainian leaders\n\nGiuliani, who has had business of his own in Ukraine in the past, meets with President Petro Poroshenko and Prosecutor General Lutsenko, among other officials, during a visit to Kyiv, hosted by the foundation of billionaire Ukrainian metals magnate Victor Pinchuk, for a lecture on democracy and the rule of law. The meetings are cited in the joint U.S. House committee investigation launched later in September 2019 (see below) into Trump and Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine.\n\nJuly 25, 2017 \u2013 President Trump issues a public call for an investigation of the 2016 Manafort revelations in Ukraine\n\nTrump tweets a reference to what he calls \u201cUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign \u2014 `quietly working to boost Clinton.\u2019 So where is the investigation A.G.,\u201d he writes, referencing then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and tagging Fox News host Sean Hannity. The tweet was referenced in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on possible obstruction of justice by the U.S. president to block the investigation into Trump campaign collusion with Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference. It also is cited in the September 2019 joint U.S. House committee letter (see below) on the investigation into Trump and Giuliani\u2019s pressure campaign against Ukraine.\n\nFast forward to late 2018\n\nLate 2018 \u2014 Two Soviet-born Florida businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, arrange a Skype call between Giuliani and Shokin, according to an investigation by the nonprofit Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) published in BuzzFeed News. The two businessmen also connect Giuliani with then-Prosecutor General Lutsenko. Giuliani invites Lutsenko to his office in New York, a meeting they arrange for January.\n\nJanuary 2019 \u2014 Giuliani and Lutsenko meet in New York over the space of two days. They discuss \u201cthe Ukrainian political situation and the fight against corruption,\u201d Bloomberg News reports, paraphrasing Lutsenko. \u201cGiuliani asked him about investigations into the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, as well as whether the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was `not loyal to President Trump,\u2019\u201d the article says.\n\nMid-February 2019 \u2014 Giuliani meets with Lutsenko again in Warsaw, according to the OCCRP/BuzzFeed report.\n\nMarch 20, 2019 \u2013 The Hill\u2019s conservative opinion writer John Solomon publishes an interview with Ukrainian Prosecutor General Lutsenko, who by this point has been widely criticized as ineffective and likely corrupt.\n\nNote: Solomon and Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity are among a constellation of conservative media figures who regularly help spread Trump and Giuliani\u2019s Biden and Manafort theories as well as other right-wing conspiracy theories, such as Uranium One, which have been debunked and shown to exclude vital information. Solomon was moved to the opinion section at The Hill, and announced Sept. 18, 2019, that he was leaving the publication.\n\nThe full video wasn\u2019t available at this publication, but the text accompanying it says Lutsenko alleged that U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who took office in August 2016, gave him a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list at their first meeting. The State Department says the claim was \u201can outright fabrication.\u201d The article says Lutsenko was examining Ukrainian civil society activists who he suspected were misusing U.S. aid funding they had received, but he says Yovanovitch told him the U.S. Embassy is confident the funding was secure.\n\nLutsenko also reportedly says he would investigate the head of NABU for the 2016 Manafort disclosure. Ukraine expert Melinda Haring of the Atlantic Council says Lutsenko is \u201cwoefully unqualified (he doesn\u2019t have a law degree), has dragged his feet on every serious anti-corruption case since being installed, and protected his friends, including Poroshenko.\u201d She continues, \u201cSean Hannity made Solomon the star of his prime-time show that evening. Trump watches Hannity, reportedly speaks with him multiple times daily, and tweeted the title of Solomon\u2019s story. More than 25,000 retweets later, the Ukrainian collusion narrative went viral.\u201d\n\nMarch 24, 2019 \u2013 Donald Trump Jr. tweets criticism of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Yovanovitch, calling her a \u201cjoker\u201d and linking to a conservative media outlet\u2019s article about calls for her ouster. The two incidents are part of a pattern of conservative attacks against the ambassador. Within less than two months, Yovanovitch is recalled to Washington.\n\nMarch 31, 2019 \u2014 First round of Ukraine\u2019s presidential election, which results in runoff between Zelenskyy and Poroshenko scheduled for April 21.\n\nApril 1, 2019 \u2013 The Hill newspaper publishes another article online by the same conservative investigative columnist John Solomon that advances the Trump-Giuliani story about Biden. (See entry on March 20 about Solomon and conspiracy theories.) The article reports that Shokin had said in written answers to questions that he had planned an investigation of Burisma before he was fired, including questioning all executive board members. The article says Lutsenko, Shokin\u2019s successor, and \u201ca case file\u201d indicate that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office had handled three cases related to Burisma, and that the \u201cmost prominent\u201d case was transferred to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which Solomon describes suggestively as \u201cclosely aligned with the U.S. Embassy in Kiev,\u201d even though it had long been public knowledge that Western supporters of Ukraine and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists strongly backed the bureau. The article says NABU closed that case.\n\nApril 2019 \u2013 Hunter Biden leaves the board of Burisma Holdings, as his father announces his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nApril 21, 2019 \u2013 New Ukrainian President elected on anti-corruption agenda\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy is elected president of Ukraine, to succeed Petro Poroshenko. He ran on a \u201czero tolerance\u201d anti-corruption agenda.\n\nApril 21, 2019 \u2013 First Trump-Zelenskyy Phone Call\n\nPresident Trump calls to congratulate him, their first known direct communication. Trump \u201curged Mr. Zelensky to coordinate with Mr. Giuliani and to pursue investigations of \u2018corruption,'\u201d the New York Times reports (on Sept. 25, 2019).\n\nApril 25, 2019 \u2013 Joe Biden formally announces campaign for President.\n\nApril 25, 2019 \u2013 President Trump tells Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity that Attorney General Bill Barr is considering allegations that Ukrainians sought to help Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign by revealing damaging information about Paul Manafort. \u201cI would imagine [Barr] would want to see this. \u2026 I would certainly defer to the attorney general, and we\u2019ll see what he says about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe calls \u2019em straight\u201d (transcript). Fox News reports that \u201cTrump echoed his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who wrote on Twitter on Wednesday [April 24]: `Keep your eye on Ukraine.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn or about April 29, 2019 \u2014 \u201cU.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation\u201d told the whistleblower that U.S. Ambassador Yovanovitch was being \u201csuddenly recalled\u201d to Washington for \u201cconsultations\u201d and \u201cwould most likely be removed from her position.\u201d The State Department announced on May 6 that she would be ending her assignment. They said it was \u201cas planned,\u201d but in fact, her assignment had been curtailed because of Lutsenko\u2019s allegations. Giuliani told a Ukrainian journalist in an interview published May 14 that Yovanovitch was \u201cremoved\u2026because she was part of the efforts against the President,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nAround the same time, the whistleblower writes that he \u201clearned from a U.S. official that `associates\u2019 of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.\u201d He didn\u2019t know whether the associates were the same two businessmen (Parnas and Fruman (see entry under \u201clate 2018\u201d) who connected Giuliani with Shokin and Lutsenko.\n\nMay 1, 2019 \u2014 Attorney General William Barr stumbles and appears to try to avoid answering U.S. Senator Kamala Harris during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing when she asks, \u201cHas the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?\u201d He finally states in his answer, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nMay 9, 2019 \u2013 Giuliani plans trip to Kyiv as part of pressure campaign\n\nGiuliani tells the New York Times he plans to travel to Kyiv and meet with President-elect Zelenskyy to urge him to investigate the Bidens as well as Ukrainians who might have worked with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to reveal the Manafort information. \u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election, we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d Giuliani tells the newspaper. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper notes the trip is \u201cpart of a months-long effort by the former New York mayor and a small group of Trump allies working to build interest in the Ukrainian inquiries. Their motivation is to try to discredit the special counsel\u2019s investigation; undermine the case against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s imprisoned former campaign chairman; and potentially to damage Mr. Biden, the early front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\u201d The news ignites a firestorm of bipartisan condemnation that Giuliani is improperly seeking the help of a foreign government to benefit Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nIn a later editorial for the Washington Post (on Sept. 21, 2019), former Ukrainian anti-corruption activist and member of Parliament Serhiy Leshchenko writes:\n\n\u201cGiuliani attempted to visit Ukraine in May 2019 with the express purpose of involving Zelensky [cq] in this process. His aim was quite clear: He was planning to ask Zelensky to intervene in an American election on the side of Trump.\n\n\u2026\n\nI had been helping Zelenksy\u2019s team since January\n\n\u2026\n\nAs a person who has had direct experience of many of these events, I express my readiness to testify to the U.S. Congress about what has been happening for the past six months.\u201d\n\nMay 9, 2019 \u2013 Giuliani, in an interview with Fox News, raises his theory of Ukrainian collusion with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016 to smear Trump with Manafort payments allegations. Giuliani says he received such information \u201cabout three or four months ago.\u201d Giuliani also discusses his theory about the Bidens in Ukraine, and he tries to implicate the U.S. Embassy in both.\n\nMay 10, 2019 \u2013 President Trump says in an interview with Politico, \u201cCertainly it would be an appropriate thing\u201d for him to ask Attorney General Barr to open an investigation on Biden. \u201cI have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven\u2019t thought of that,\u201d he adds. Trump says he sees Biden as the clear front-runner in the Democratic race and likens it to his own surge toward the Republican nomination in 2016. He also says he will speak with Giuliani about the former mayor\u2019s planned trip to Ukraine and that they hadn\u2019t discussed it \u201cat any great length.\u201d\n\nMay 11, 2019 \u2013 Giuliani cancels trip to Ukraine\n\nGiuliani tells Fox News he called off his trip to Ukraine because he believes he would be \u201cwalking into a group of people that are enemies of the president, and in some cases, enemies of the United States,\u201d a particularly harsh reference that sounds like it is meant for Ukrainian anti-corruption reformers who are rejecting his and Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories. The decision follows bipartisan backlash in the United States over Giuliani\u2019s seeking foreign support for Trump\u2019s re-election (see May 2 above).\n\nFormer Ukrainian member of Parliament Serhiy Leshchenko and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst say Zelenskyy actually had declined Giuliani\u2019s request for a meeting, which could explain Giuliani\u2019s tone of rejection. Herbst commented, \u201cMy understanding is that the president-elect\u2019s party and his group said that the President-elect [Zelenskyy] sees no reason to have a meeting about an issue which is so transparently an American domestic political issue.\u201d\n\nOn or about May 14, 2019 \u2014 President Trump instructs Vice President Mike Pence \u201cto cancel his planned trip to Ukraine to attend President Zelenskyy\u2019s inauguration. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the U.S. delegation instead,\u201d writes the whistleblower, who cites unnamed \u201cU.S. officials.\u201d \u201cAccording to these officials, it was also `made clear\u2019 to them that the President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenskyy `chose to act,'\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nMay 14, 2019 \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General Lutsenko tells Bloomberg News that he has \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing\u201d by either of the Bidens and that neither Hunter Biden nor Burisma were the focus of any current investigation. He said he planned to give U.S. authorities information about Burisma board payments, so that the U.S. could check whether Hunter Biden had paid taxes on his income, though there were no restrictions in Ukraine on how much a company could pay to its board members.\n\nMay 20-24, 2019 \u2013 Zelenskyy is inaugurated as president, taking over from Poroshenko. Shortly afterwards, the whistleblower writes, \u201cit was publicly reported that Mr. Giuliani met with two other Ukrainian officials: Ukraine\u2019s Special Anticorruption Prosecutor, Mr. Nazar Kholodnytskyy, and a former Ukrainian diplomat named Andriy Telizhenko.\u201d (Public reports of these meetings included Ukrainian and US media outlets.) Both, the whistleblower continues, \u201care allies of Mr. Lutsenko and made similar allegations\u201d in a series of articles in The Hill. The two businessmen Parnas and Fruman who connected Giuliani with Shokin and Lutsenko (see entry for \u201clate 2018\u201d) reportedly join the meeting with Giuliani and Kholodnytskyy in Paris.\n\nMid May to early July \u2013 According to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, in this period, \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019 on the issues that had been publicly aired by Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nJune 11, 2019 \u2013 Zelenskyy sends a motion to Parliament asking that it dismiss sitting Prosecutor General Lutsenko.\n\nJune 4, 2019 \u2013 Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, is seated next to Zelenskyy at a dinner in Brussels hosted by U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, part of an early Embassy celebration of the U.S. Independence Day. Kushner had dropped off from Trump\u2019s visit to the U.K. to attend the occasion in Brussels.\n\nJune 13, 2019 \u2013\u2013 President Trump says he would accept dirt on his political rivals from a foreign government, a statement noted by the whistleblower, whose complaint references the relevant interview of the president with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos.\n\nJune 21, 2019 \u2014 Giuliani tweets, \u201cNew Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden bribery of Pres Poroshenko. Time for leadership and investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Obama people.\u201d\n\nEarly to mid-July \u2013 Trump orders suspension and review of U.S. aid to Ukraine\n\nPresident Trump tells his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in aid to Ukraine at least a week before his phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President Zelenskyy, the Washington Post reports. The decision was communicated by OMB to State and Defense department officials on July 18. The Post includes details of internal processes, including that \u201cbesides Bolton [the president\u2019s national security adviser], several other administration officials said they did not know why the aid was being canceled or why a meeting was not being scheduled.\u201d\n\nAbout July 19, 2019 \u2014 Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelenskyy, reportedly requests assistance from the State Department\u2019s special representative for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt Volker, to be put in touch with Giuliani. On July 19, Volker sends a text message to Giuliani saying, \u201cMr. Mayor\u2014really enjoyed breakfast this morning. As discussed, connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.\u201d\n\nYermak speaks with Giuliani for the first time by phone. They discuss the Trump-Giuliani demands for investigations and the new Ukrainian leader\u2019s desire for a White House meeting to affirm continued U.S. support for Ukraine. \u201cMr. Giuliani in television appearances over the summer had repeatedly singled out Ukraine over corruption, putting pressure on Mr. Zelensky\u2019s new administration. Yermak called Mr. Giuliani to ask him to tone it down, according to a person familiar with the call. Mr. Giuliani in response suggested that Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with Burisma,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reports (on Sept. 26).\n\nJuly 23-26, 2019 \u2014 \u201cDuring interagency meetings on 23 July and 26 July, OMB officials again stated explicitly that the instruction to suspend this assistance had come directly from the President, but they still were unaware of a policy rationale,\u201d the whistleblower wrote.\n\nJuly 25, 2019 \u2014 Trump and Zelenskyy speak by phone for the first time since the call on May 20.\n\nThe two presidents have their second conversation. An English-language press release issued by Zelenskyy\u2019s office about the call says:\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is convinced that the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve [the] image of Ukraine, complete investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA. He also confirmed continued support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine by the United States and the readiness of the American side to fully contribute to the implementation of a Large-Scale Reform Program in our country.\u201d\n\nThe two presidents \u201cagreed to substantively discuss practical issues of Ukrainian-American cooperation during the visit of the Ukrainian head of state to the United States,\u201d the release continued.\n\nZelenskyy had been hoping for a warm reception from the U.S. president and a White House meeting as an important signal to affirm continued American support for Ukraine\u2019s war against Russian forces controlling the country\u2019s east and for comprehensive reform and economic development efforts. Ukraine advocates in the U.S. also had thought a White House invitation would be forthcoming any day, but it was never scheduled.\n\nAn intelligence community whistleblower complaint revealed in September that reportedly involves the Trump-Zelenskyy July 25 call prompts a flurry of revelations about the conversation until the declassification of a transcript of the call.\n\nBefore the release of the transcript, Trump admits he discussed Biden on the call (see Sept. 22 below) and says U.S. funding for Ukraine is at stake (see Sept. 22-23 below).\n\nJuly 26, 2019 \u2014 U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker meets with Zelenskyy in Kyiv.\n\nVolker was accompanied by U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. The two advised the Ukrainian leader on \u201chow to `navigate\u2019 the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelenskyy,\u201d according to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nJuly 28, 2019 \u2013 Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats submits his resignation, effective Aug. 15. One of President Trump\u2019s longest-serving Cabinet members, Coats also stirred his boss\u2019s ire at times with his policy disagreements and lukewarm endorsements of the President\u2019s positions.\n\nJuly 31, 2019 \u2013 Giuliani meets in New York with Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, who is in a power struggle with Zelenskyy over a second title he holds as head of the city\u2019s administration. Giuliani and Klitschko have known each other for years \u2013 the former Ukrainian boxing champion hired the former New York mayor as a consultant on his Kyiv mayoral campaign in 2008. On Sept. 4, Zelenskyy stripped Klitschko of the head of administration post, apparently in a move to restore checks-and-balances in the capital.\n\nOn or about Aug. 2, 2019 \u2013 Giuliani meets in Madrid with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelenskyy.\n\nHaving been rebuffed in June for a meeting in Kyiv with Zelenskyy personally, Giuliani flies to Madrid to press the new Ukrainian president\u2019s aide, Yermak, for an investigation of the Bidens as well as a probe of the allegation that Ukrainians conspired with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016 to release damaging information about Paul Manafort. The Madrid meeting was a \u201c`direct followup'\u201d to the July 25 Trump-Zelenskyy phone call and specifically to their discussion of the cases the U.S. president raised in that conversation, according to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. From Madrid, Giuliani resurfaces his allegations against the Bidens in a tweet on Aug. 3.\n\nGiuliani has said Yermak seemed open to considering the investigations, but also pressed for a Trump-Zelenskyy meeting as a sign of continued U.S. support to Ukraine in its war against Russia and its economic development and internal reform efforts. \u201cI talked to him about the whole package,\u201d Giuliani told the Washington Post. The Post reported that \u201cU.S. officials and members of the Trump administration wanted the meeting [between the two Presidents] to go ahead, but Trump personally rejected efforts to set it up, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\u201d\n\nAug. 12, 2019 \u2013 A whistleblower files a complaint to Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) Michael Atkinson related to an alleged \u201curgent concern\u201d that news reports later reveal likely centers on activities involving President Trump and Ukraine. The ICIG determines the complaint meets the definition of an \u201curgent concern\u201d and is credible, and forwards it on Aug. 26 to Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire, who under the law was required to transmit the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees within seven days. The Justice Department, however, takes the position that the statute does not apply on the ground that the complaint does not involve \u201can intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the Director of National Intelligence.\u201d The complaint remains under wraps until House Intelligence Committee Chairman reveals its existence on Sept. 13 (see below).\n\nAug. 15, 2019 \u2013 DNI Coats leaves office. Principal Deputy Director Sue Gordon resigns too, after it became clear that Trump would not select her to succeed Coats.\n\nAug. 26, 2019 \u2013 The Inspector General forwards the intelligence community whistleblower complaint to Acting DNI Maguire.\n\nAug. 28, 2019 \u2013 Then-U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton becomes the first high-level Trump administration official to visit Kyiv since President Zelenskyy\u2019s inauguration. Bolton says the two discussed a possible meeting between the two presidents during a trip Trump planned at the time to Poland.\n\nAug. 28, 2019 \u2013 Politico breaks the news that President Trump was delaying the distribution of $250 million of fiscal 2019 security assistance that Ukraine needs to fight its war with Russia on its eastern flank, by asking his administration to review how it was being spent. The hold on the aid package at the same time as Trump and Giuliani were agitating publicly for Ukraine to investigate Biden raises the specter that the U.S. president was using congressionally appropriated taxpayer dollars as leverage to coerce a foreign government to investigate his potential rival in the 2020 election. The hold also constitutes a reversal of the Trump administration\u2019s stance toward Ukraine, after having approved lethal defensive weapons sales in 2017, a move the Obama administration had resisted. It is unclear exactly when the review was ordered, but the suspension pending review was in place during the July 25 call. The Department of Defense determined that the support should continue and informed the White House of its recommendation, according to Politico and CNN. National Security Adviser John Bolton also wanted to release the funds to help Ukraine curtail Russian aggression, the Washington Post reports.\n\nAug. 29, 2019 \u2013 Zelenskyy appoints lawyer and former Deputy Minister of Justice Ruslan Riaboshapka as the new prosecutor general, replacing Yuriy Lutsenko, who steps down the same day.\n\nSept. 2019 \u2013 The Wall Street Journal reports, \u201cUkrainian officials earlier this month expressed concern to U.S. senators that the aid had been held up as a penalty for resisting that pressure.\u201d\n\nSept. 2, 2019 \u2013 Vice President Mike Pence, a day after meeting with the new Ukrainian president, doesn\u2019t directly answer a reporter\u2019s question about whether he can assure Ukrainians that the delay in $250 million of U.S. security assistance for Ukraine is unrelated to President Trump\u2019s and Rudy Giuliani\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nSept. 5, 2019 \u2014 New Prosecutor General Ruslan Riaboshapka brings Vitaliy Kasko back to the office as First Deputy Prosecutor General, a move that promises to help restore integrity to the office. Kasko is the former deputy of Shokin\u2019s who had quit out of frustration.\n\nSept. 9, 2019 Inspector General for the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson informs House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff and Ranking Member Devin Nunes of the whistleblower complaint\u2019s existence (full text of the Inspector General\u2019s letter)\n\nSept. 9, 2019 \u2013 Three U.S. House committees launch probe into Trump and Giuliani pressure campaign\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform committees announce a joint investigation of Trump and Giuliani\u2019s alleged efforts to strongarm Ukraine into pursuing two investigations for the president\u2019s political gain, including by threatening to withhold $250 million in security assistance. The joint press release says public records show the efforts have continued \u201cfor nearly two years\u201d and were conducted \u201cunder the guise of anti-corruption activity.\u201d\n\nSept. 11, 2019 \u2013 Trump releases the hold on U.S. security assistance to Ukraine\n\nState Department notifies Congress that it will provide Ukraine with $141.5 million of military equipment and other assistance under its \u201cForeign Military Financing\u201d program that is available for a number of countries. The news emerges the next day, Sept. 12, at the same time that U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham says the administration has released its hold on the separate $250 million of military assistance for Ukraine from the Defense Department under a program known as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. President Trump gave permission to the OMB\u2019s acting director, Russell Vought, to release the funds. The timing of the news on both aid packages leads to speculation that the Trump administration was topping up its bribe/extortion of Ukraine, but the Foreign Military Financing likely had been in the works for months, possibly a year.\n\nSept. 13, 2019 \u2013 Intelligence community whistleblower complaint revealed\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chair Schiff announces that he has issued a subpoena to Acting DNI Maguire to obtain a complaint from a whistleblower filed under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) that, under the law, should have been provided to the congressional intelligence committees. Schiff says he is concerned the complaint is being withheld \u201cto cover up serious misconduct\u201d and \u201cto protect the President or other Administration officials.\u201d\n\nSept. 17, 2019 \u2013 The Inspector General for the Intelligence Community sends letter to House Intelligence Chairman Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes outlining his disagreement with the administration\u2019s decision to withhold the whistleblower\u2019s complaint from the congressional intelligence committees. The Inspector General\u2019s letter states, \u201cthe subject matter involved in the complainant\u2019s disclosure not only falls within the DNI\u2019s jurisdiction, but relates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\u201d\n\nSept. 18, 2019 \u2013 Vice President Pence speaks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy by phone, discussing a scheduled meeting between the two presidents during the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York the following week. Pence \u201ccommended President Zelenskyy\u2019s administration for its bold action to tackle corruption through legislative reforms, and offered full U.S. support for those efforts,\u201d according to a U.S. Embassy statement.\n\nSept. 20, 2019 \u2013 A senior advisor to Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister challenges Trump to make official U.S. government request if he wants an investigation of Biden. The adviser, Anton Geraschenko, told The Daily Beast that \u201ccurrently there is no open investigation.\u201d He adds, \u201cClearly, Trump is now looking for kompromat to discredit his opponent Biden, to take revenge for his friend Paul Manafort, who is serving seven years in prison.\u201d\n\nSept. 22, 2019 \u2013 After days of insisting there was nothing inappropriate about his telephone call with Zelenskyy, President Trump acknowledges discussing Joe Biden with the Ukrainian leader during their July 25 phone call. \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters.\n\nSept. 22 and 23, 2019 \u2013 Trump himself connects phone call on Biden to US aid to Ukraine\n\nPresident Trump, in two sets of remarks to reporters asking about his July 25 phone call with Zelenskyy, appears to confirm a connection between U.S. financial assistance for Ukraine and his pressure for the country\u2019s leaders to pursue the investigations he wants.\n\nOn Sept. 22 Trump says, \u201cCertainly I\u2019d have every right to [raise Biden with the Ukrainian President] if there\u2019s corruption and we are paying lots of money to a country.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly referred to what he falsely claims the Bidens to have done as \u201ccorruption.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption,\u201d Trump tells the reporters on Sept. 23. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u2026It\u2019s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d\n\nSept. 23, 2019 \u2013 The chairmen of the three House committees conducting the joint investigation into Trump and Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government write Secretary of State Pompeo demanding he turn over the documents the committees had requested on Sept. 9. The letter characterizes Trump\u2019s actions as \u201cseeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election,\u201d and says, \u201cif press reports are accurate, such corrupt use of presidential power for the President\u2019s personal political interest \u2013 and not for the national interest \u2013 is a betrayal of the President\u2019s oath of office and cannot go unchecked.\u201d The chairmen note the earlier deadline of Sept. 16 to produce the material had passed and give a new deadline of Sept. 26 to notify the committees whether the State Department intends to comply.\n\nSept. 25, 2019 \u2013 Trump and Zelenskyy are scheduled to meet for the first time\n\nThe two presidents are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the opening sessions of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The meeting between the presidents has been delayed since the Ukrainians began requesting it in early summer, and still doesn\u2019t equate to an invitation for a formal meeting at the White House that Zelenskyy has sought as an important signal of continued U.S. support for Ukraine\u2019s war against Russia and its battle against corruption.\n\n* The timeline, originally published on Sept. 24, 2019, has been updated as of Sept. 26-27, 2019, to add new items (indicated in red) at the following dates: late 2018; January 2019; mid-February 2019; March 31, 2019; April 21, 2019, on or about April 29, 2019; May 1, 2019; on or about May 14, 2019; June 13, 2019; June 21, 2019; July 18, 2019; and July 26, 2019.
