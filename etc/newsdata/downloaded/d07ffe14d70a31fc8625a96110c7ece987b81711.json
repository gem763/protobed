The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews mergers and stock purchases to ensure they do not harm U.S. national security.\n\nMuch of its highest profile work focuses on Chinese companies, many with government links, that have tried to buy U.S. high-end semiconductor makers and other tech companies.\n\nJapan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) has also come under increasing U.S. scrutiny over its ties to Chinese firms in the face of an escalating trade and technology war between Washington and Beijing.", "description": "Japan will tighten reporting requirements for foreign investment in industries related to national security, officials said on Tuesday, reflecting broad concern that China could gain access to key technology and confidential information.", "authors": ["Tetsushi Kajimoto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
