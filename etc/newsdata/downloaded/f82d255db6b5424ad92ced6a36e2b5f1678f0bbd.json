We need to do all we can to protect the public from tobacco-related disease and death, and prevent e-cigarettes from becoming an on-ramp to nicotine addiction for a generation of youth. @HHSGov \u2014 Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) September 9, 2019 Report\n\nShe was present at Wednesday's announcement.\n\nMr Trump told reporters his administration would implement strong rules to protect \"innocent children\", including his 13-year-old son Barron.\n\n\"We can't allow people to get sick and we can't have our youth be so affected,\" he said.\n\n\"That's how the first lady got involved. She's got a son, together, that is a beautiful young man and she feels very, very strongly about it.\n\n\"She's seen it. We're both reading it, a lot of people are reading it. But people are dying with vaping so we're looking at it very, very closely.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHe added that he hoped the announcement would make parents become \"tougher\".\n\n\"People are going to watch what we're saying and parents are going be a lot tougher with respect to their children,\" said the president.\n\n\"A lot of people think vaping is wonderful, it's great. It's really not wonderful.\"\n\nIn a press release shortly after Mr Trump's announcement, the health secretary said officials \"will not stand idly by\" as a generation becomes addicted to nicotine.\n\nActing FDA Commissioner Dr Ned Sharpless said \"if we see a migration to tobacco-flavored products by kids, we will take additional steps to address youth use of these products\".\n\nE-cigarette manufacturers such as Juul have been blamed for fuelling childhood addiction through flavoured products such as mango, cream or cinnamon roll.\n\nJuul, which dominates the market, last year stopped selling most of its flavoured devices in order to defuse mounting criticism.\n\nHealth officials are still investigating whether a particular toxin or substance is causing the vaping-related illnesses, or whether it's the result of heavy usage.\n\nThe first death occurred in Illinois in late August. Since then, five more have died and hundreds have been sickened across 33 states.\n\nThe cause of the vaping illness has not yet been pinpointed by health officials.\n\nTHC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis, was present in some, but not all of the devices used by those who fell ill, say authorities.\n\nThe FDA has said many of the products were found to contain significant amounts of vitamin E acetate, an oil used to thicken the vaping liquid.\n\nSeveral patients have been found with lipoid pneumonia, which occurs when someone inhales fats or oils.", "description": "The president says his administration will implement strong rules to protect \"innocent children\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07n285t.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
