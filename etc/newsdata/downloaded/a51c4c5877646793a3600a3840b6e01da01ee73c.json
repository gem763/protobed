The official, Kyle Frese, appeared to be in a romantic relationship with one of the journalists, according to the Justice Department, citing social media pages.\n\nZach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney for the northern district of Virginia, whose office charged Frese, called the leaks \u201cdastardly and felonious.\u201d\n\nDOJ said in a press release that court-ordered surveillance caught Frese, a Defense Intelligence Agency counterterrorism analyst, sharing classified information with one of the two journalists in a phone call.\n\nThe news is the latest example of DOJ\u2019s wide-ranging leak hunts, and in a conference call about Frese\u2019s indictment, Assistant Attorney General John Demers cited former Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 August 2017 press conference about a leak crackdown.\n\nThe department has charged six people with leaks in just over two years, according to Demers. He said the probes are challenging, and that the First Amendment concerns make them \u201cdoubly challenging,\u201d but added that those challenges had not kept the department from ferreting out leakers.\n\nThe journalist who Frese allegedly had a relationship with published at least eight articles with classified information from five intelligence reports.\n\nTerwilliger would not comment on whether DOJ plans to charge the journalists involved, and they were not identified.\n\nFrese was arrested Wednesday morning when he arrived at the Defense Intelligence Agency, according to DOJ.", "description": "The Justice Department says it appears Kyle Frese had a romantic relationship with one of two journalists he allegedly fed information.", "authors": ["Betsy Swan", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_674,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570642452/RTS2E6RB_x1nqpl", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
