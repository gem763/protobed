But when we use our new elevation data, we find far more people living in vulnerable areas than we previously understood.\"\n\nPart of the problem with the Nasa system was that it mistook rooftops and trees for ground level, he said.\n\nMr Strauss added: \"It turns out that for most of the global coast we didn't know the height of the ground beneath our feet.\"", "description": "Around 300 million people will be vulnerable to annual flooding by 2050, three times as many as previously thought, according to a new climate change study.", "authors": ["Nick Allen", "Allister Heath", "David Goodhart", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000214518659-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvWdfq-a34Yz0x6lFPidU76eZDX_TlUAsSQ8Q9bVPHGg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
