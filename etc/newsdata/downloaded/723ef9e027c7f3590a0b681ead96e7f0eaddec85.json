The tax would rise to 3% for assets above $1 billion. Warren says her wealth tax would raise $275 billion per year, which she\u2019d use to pay off student debt for millions, cover college costs for the majority of students and finance universal child care.\n\nThe Sanders plan has a lower threshold for wealth, and higher tax rates. His plan has 8 different tax levels, starting with a 1% tax on wealth above $32 million. The rate would rise to 2% on wealth from $50 million to $250 million, with a top rate of 8% on wealth over $10 billion. Sanders says his plan would raise $435 billon per year, which he\u2019d use to fund a single-payer health plan, more affordable housing and universal child care.\n\nHow high is too high?\n\nA wealth tax is a plausible way to raise large amounts of money from people most able to afford it. But economists who have studied the concept say there\u2019s an \u201coptimal\u201d level of taxation that preserves the stock of wealth subject to taxation, so that the tax generates a stable stream of revenue over time. If it\u2019s above the optimal level, the wealth tax would be \u201cconfiscatory\u201d and erode the wealth of the superrich, leaving less wealth to tax. If set too high, a wealth tax would trigger its own demise, since wealth would eventually fall below the thresholds for taxation.\n\nSen.

An 8% tax on assets worth more than $10 billion, for instance, means those assets would have to generate annual investment returns of 8% just to keep the family\u2019s net worth steady. That\u2019s a tough target, especially in a time of low interest rates. On assets from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, the Sanders tax rate would be 4%. It\u2019s easier to hit an annual average return of 4%, but even that\u2019s not a given in a bear stock market or recession.\n\nSanders harbors no love for the 1%, and he\u2019d shed no tears for those who\u2019d lose billionaire status under his plan. But the lower rates under Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan might generate more sustainable revenue, and be more politically palatable, besides.\n\nThinning the herd of billionaires\n\nIn recent research on wealth taxation, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley modeled the effect of two different wealth taxes on America\u2019s 15 richest billionaires, using net worth data published by Forbes. At the top of the list, Jeff Bezos\u2019s net worth of $160 billion would have fallen to $87 billion if a 3% tax on wealth above $1 billion had been in place since 1982. But if the tax had been 10% \u2013 closer to the Sanders levels\u2014his wealth would have fallen to $24 billion. The lower tax rate cut Bezos\u2019s wealth by 46%, while the higher tax rate cut it by 85%.\n\nMost members of the Forbes 400 are worth less than $10 billion, and two-thirds are worth less than $5 billion. Warren\u2019s 3% tax on wealth above $1 billion would undoubtedly thin the herd of billionaires. The Sanders wealth tax could endanger the herd.\n\nSen.
