It's a joke. I don't know why she hasn't said anything to me in person.\"\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail / MEN Media)\n\nThe shepherd's pie issue also garnered a reaction fro Miss Jarvis, who is expecting her fourth child.\n\n\"She failed to tell me any of this last week,\" the mum said of the hot dinner claims.\n\n\"Apparently he was [offered Shepherd's Pie] and didn't like it, but why didn't she say that?\n\n\"I know I wouldn't and he didn't choose it as a hot meal as I know he doesn't like it.\n\n\"No deserts were mentioned to me either because I wouldn't have minded even if he had some sponge and custard, at least it was something, but she didn't once tell me that there was pudding available until I got the email.\n\n\"I'm fuming with the e-mail she sent to me.\"", "description": "Thanet Primary School in Hull has warned Stacy Jarvis she could be banned from the grounds for \"rude and aggressive behaviour\"", "authors": ["Joanna Lovell", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Hull Daily Mail", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587829.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195688184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
