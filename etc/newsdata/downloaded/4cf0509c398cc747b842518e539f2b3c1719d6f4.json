McEathron killed himself in May in the face of allegations that he and McDonald stole $3.5 million in authority funds and used it to buy four properties.\n\nAD\n\nMcEathron had not been charged with a crime. But several others besides McDonald have been charged with felonies, including her husband, Samuel North. Last month, all five members of the Warren County Board of Supervisors, County Administrator Douglas Stanley and current and former board members of the authority were charged with misdemeanor counts of misfeasance and nonfeasance for allegedly allowing the embezzlement and misconduct to occur.\n\nAD\n\nTran says in his court filing that McDonald used his plans to build a three-building data center complex \u2014 on a 30-acre portion of the former Superfund site that once hosted the Avtex Fibers rayon manufacturing plant \u2014 to advance her own interests.\n\nIn one alleged scam, Tran says, McDonald forged his signature to make it look like he had agreed to finance a police academy to be run by McEathron.\n\nAD\n\nTran also claims that McDonald falsely informed him that $1.5 million he collected from the authority in reimbursed construction costs for the data center project came out of a state grant. He says he later learned the grant didn\u2019t exist.\n\nAnd Tran accuses McDonald of lying about the site\u2019s suitability for new construction, allegedly telling him that the dirt was \u201cso clean you could eat off it,\u201d when it still contained chemical waste.\n\nAD\n\nFinally, Tran argues that he obtained the $10 million loan for the project legitimately, and has been making monthly payments on it of $42,160, which a Warren County attorney confirmed to The Washington Post.\n\nThe authority\u2019s board approved the loan as a way to start construction on the data center while Tran rounded up financing through the federal EB-5 investment visa program, Tran claims in his court filing.\n\nAD", "description": "Truc \u201cCurt\u201d Tran says allegations linked to his data center project ruined chances for financing and damaged his reputation.", "authors": ["Antonio Olivo", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Demographics In Northern Virginia"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Bls-tLslzg0f_9f_ry1F7YtRHEM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7VBIF5WANAI6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
