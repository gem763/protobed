While the actress felt the appearance was \u201charmless fun,\u201d her choice took things far more seriously.\n\nEDIE ADAMS\u2019 SON EXPLAINS WHY HER LATE HUSBAND ERNIE KOVACS IS SEEMINGLY FORGOTTEN IN HOLLYWOOD\n\n\u201cThat was awful,\u201d the 72-year-old recently told Closer Weekly. \u201cBecause the guy thought that this was really going to be a date, right? \u2018The Dating Game\u2019 got more serious later where people would be sent on trips. I only got to go to the Ambassador Hotel to see a show, but the guy thought we were going to make out in the limo and it was like, \u2018You know this is a first date, right?\u2019 It was so sleazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d go to dinner and then to a show, which is the prize I won, but the guy thought this was serious,\u201d continued Valentine. \u201cI wanted to get out of the date. You know, \u2018Save the money, who needs to go on a date? Let me do another show. Give me a shot at acting or something.\u2019\u201d\n\nValentine\u2019s big break on television came with \u201cRoom 222,\u201d which centered on a black high school teacher trying to teach his students to be tolerant. It starred Lloyd Haynes, Denise Nicholas, Michael Constantine and Valentine, among others. The show aired from 1969 until 1974.\n\nValentine won an Emmy for \u201cOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series\u201d in 1970.\n\n\u2018LEAVE IT TO BEAVER\u2019 STAR TONY DOW EXPLAINS WHY HE WASN\u2019T ALLOWED TO WATCH HIT SERIES GROWING UP\n\n\u201cIt was kind of mind-blowing to have that happen so soon, so quickly,\u201d said Valentine. \u201cAnd to meet Carol Burnett and her saying, \u2018Well, congratulations for this.\u2019 It was like, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 But that Carol Burnett would know me? Just incredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember I was taking singing lessons at the time and I went to my singing class,\u201d continued Valentine. \u201cAlso taking lessons was Gregory Peck\u2026 When he walked by, I was at the teacher\u2019s piano and he saw me through the window and kind of mimed, \u2018You did it!\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh my God. It\u2019s Gregory Peck!\u2019 How was it that I had the fortune to meet these stars and talented people from the get-go?\u201d\n\nAccording to Closer Weekly, reviews for \u201cRoom 222\u201d seemed promising after Season 1 and it ultimately became a favorite among critics. However, the show suffered a dramatic drop in the ratings and ABC canceled it mid-season in 1974.\n\nValentine told the outlet that the news took everyone by surprise.\n\n\u2018LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE\u2019 ACTRESS WENDI LOU LEE SAYS SHE RELIED ON GOD TO HELP HER FACE BRAIN TUMOR\n\n\u201cWhy things changed, I have no idea,\u201d she explained. \u201cABC did have the kindness to come and tell us before we read it in the papers because that\u2019s how things were cut in those days: You just didn\u2019t come to work the next day. But they did have the wherewithal to give us the word that it was happening and it was sad\u2026 well, it\u2019s always sad, but especially when you feel you have a good product and a good show, for it to be taken away. But in the end, the network made the decision to go in a different direction. That\u2019s what they always say, \u2018We\u2019ve decided to go in a different direction.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Valentine didn\u2019t stay unemployed for long. The year after \u201cRoom 222\u201d came to an end, she was cast in a new ABC series titled \u201cKaren.\u201d However, the show lasted just one season.\n\n\u201c\u2026 \u2018Karen,\u2019 created by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, used controversial political stories that were a savvy, humoristic reflection of then-current headlines, post-Watergate,\u201d Valentine recalled. \u201cThe original opening titles were a take-off of the opening of the film \u2018Patton.\u2019 Instead of George C. Scott, you had me marching up to an American flag background. Really clever, but never aired. It was changed to me riding a bicycle around D.C. The network envisioned something softer, more romantic and personal, and not too complicated, as opposed to an issue-oriented drama/comedy in the political arena. I\u2019d say it was ahead of its time.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Valentine kept busy pursuing television gigs. Her most recent role was that of Audrey Landry in the 2004 TV film \u201cWedding Daze.\u201d Still, she cherishes her time bringing \u201cRoom 222\u201d to life.\n\n\u2018BRADY BUNCH\u2019 STAR MAUREEN MCCORMICK SAYS SHE AND COSTAR ANN B. DAVIS WERE \u2018SO CLOSE\u2019 AFTER SITCOM ENDED\n\n\u201cWorking with all of those people and to have that kind of experience first time out \u2014 the show just brings back the fondest and best memories in the world to me,\u201d said Valentine. \u201cIt also kind of spoiled me, because it set the bar really high. So when other things come to you, you think, \u2018Want is this?\u2019 It was different, you know. But I was fortunate that I did get material that was pretty fun and well done. But to have your first thing be something that was so special and groundbreaking, and that you felt meant something and was affecting people \u2014 how do you top that?\u201d", "description": "Before Karen Valentine won an Emmy for her role as Alice Johnson in \u201cRoom 222,\u201d she was a budding starlet who decided to appear on \u201cThe Dating Game.\u201d", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/6d0f8910-GettyImages-93772838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
