This is especially problem with lists that gather together the best entertainment from a particular year \u2014 whether it\u2019s movies, games, or music \u2014 and end up jam-packed with experiences released in the later months.\n\nTo get around this, we\u2019ve created this landing page dedicated to all the best games of 2019. It\u2019s not a list that we labor over at the end of the year; instead, think of it as a living document, one that will continue to grow as new games come out and delight us. That way we won\u2019t forget anything.\n\nLuckily, 2019 started with a bang, thanks to great games like Resident Evil 2, Wargroove, Devil May Cry 5, and yet another clever reimagining of Tetris \u2014 expect things to only get more interesting from there. If you\u2019re ever in need of something new to play, this is the place to check out.", "description": "The Verge\u2019s guide to the Xbox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC, iPhone, and Android games you need to play, including Apex Legends, Tetris 99, Resident Evil 2, Super Mario Maker 2, Control, Telling Lies, and many more.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Dami Lee", "Sam Byford", "Megan Farokhmanesh"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MI3Zs1M6A2-XKB3w8DYxUIJ6-h8=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13755275/acastro_190208_3223_best_games_2019_0002.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-22"}
