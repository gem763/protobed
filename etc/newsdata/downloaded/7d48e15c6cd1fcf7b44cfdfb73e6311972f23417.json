However, a Tory source said that City Hall had received a response a little under an hour after the deadline had passed\n\n'Missing the deadline of a polite request to fully co-operate is unhelpful and this already serious situation has now become grave,' the Labour assembly member said, before the source said the information had been sent.\n\n'The allegations of potential misuse of taxpayers' money are no laughing matter. We will be taking this further.'\n\nA Tory source confirmed Mr Johnson had not responded by the deadline, but went on to say they had responded 'just before 7pm'.\n\nThe source said it was missed because 'it was an invented City Hall deadline that they have never said to us', and criticised London Assembly 'grandstanding' and Mr Duvall for 'playing politics'.", "description": "Mr Johnson was obliged to maintain details of the meetings he attended as mayor, none of which contain any public reference to Ms Arcuri, who received \u00a3126,000 in public grants.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/20/19458072-0-image-a-29_1570563321621.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
