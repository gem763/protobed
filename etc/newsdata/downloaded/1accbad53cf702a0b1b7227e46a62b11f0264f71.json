It\u2019s not just playing with the ball \u2013 it\u2019s also what you do without it.\n\n\u2018They started the game very well from that point of view, everyone was engaging.\n\nEXAMPLE 1 Keown felt Aubameyang was slow to press Bournemouth\u2019s defenders. (Picture: BBC Sport) \u2018I know it\u2019s tough but you can\u2019t allow that kind of space,\u2019 Keown said. (Picture: BBC Sport) According to Keown, Arsenal\u2019s defence were sat far too deep in the second half. (Picture: BBC Sport)\n\n\u2018But in the second half they seemed to switch off. Aubameyang\u2026 look, you\u2019re scoring the goals but, fella, you need to work harder!\n\n\u2018I know it\u2019s tough but you can\u2019t allow that kind of space. [Bukayo] Saka as well, nobody really getting there, they just don\u2019t engage properly and the back four is far too deep.\n\n\u2018Because the back four are so deep, look at the space behind the full-backs and they\u2019re [Bournemouth] just running wild into those spaces and it\u2019s a problem for Arsenal.\n\n\u2018They need to be better.\u2019\n\nEXAMPLE 2 Aubameyang must work harder when Arsenal aren\u2019t in possession, says Keown. (Picture: BBC Sport) Keown also criticised Guendouzi and Xhaka for failing to press with Ceballos. (Picture: BBC Sport)\n\nKeown added: \u2018This [above] is exactly the same. Aubameyang is slow to press and Saka doesn\u2019t make it either which allows Bournemouth to play it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Dani Ceballos, the poor fella, is in there on his own \u2013 the two other midfield players (Matteo Guendouzi and Granit Xhaka) should get up with him and be together as a midfield.\n\n\u2018These are things you need to work on in training because better teams will punish Arsenal.\n\n\u2018That has to improve if they are going to finish in the top four.\u2019\n\nEmery said he was \u2018very proud\u2019 of Arsenal\u2019s victory but admitted his players lost momentum in a lacklustre second-half display against Eddie Howe\u2019s side.\n\n\u2018We were speaking before the match, the first four matches we played, today we wanted to do one step ahead, doing better and controlling better the match but knowing it was going to be difficult,\u2019 the Spaniard said.\n\n\u2018We played with a very good organisation, defensively very strong. We scored one goal and got into their box with possibilities to score goals.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018The second half was a very good opportunity to keep our confidence, to get better with the ball and stop their action with the ball.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We did it perfectly in the first half but in the second half, maybe because the chances arrived late, we lost that.\n\n\u2018We are very happy with that result and very proud of that result.\u2019\n\nMORE: Paul Pogba posts injury update to Manchester United fans after Newcastle defeat", "description": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has got Arsenal out of trouble time and time again this season, but Martin Keown had no problem criticising the striker after the side's 1-0 win over Bournemouth....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/martin-1968_1570451574.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
