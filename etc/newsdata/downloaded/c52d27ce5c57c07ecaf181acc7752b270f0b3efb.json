Not surprising given the nature of the injury and his presence with a walking boot and crutches on the sideline. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 23, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter had a more specific timetable and said the injury could knock Barkley out until after the team\u2019s Week 11 bye.\n\nMRI revealed Giants\u2019 RB Saquon Barkley suffered a high ankle sprain that could sideline him anywhere from 4-8 weeks, per source. Longer timeline is considered more likely; the Giants have a bye in week 11, which could give him eight weeks to recover and return for last six games. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 23, 2019\n\nThat certainly takes the steam out of a huge Giants win on Sunday that was notable for rookie quarterback Daniel Jones\u2019 excellent first career start.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nWayne Gallman will presumably take over as the Giants\u2019 starting back with Barkley out.\n\nSaquon Barkley\u2019s injury a blow for Giants and NFL\n\nBarkley\u2019s injury is a big blow to the Giants and the NFL as a whole.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarkley, the second pick of last year\u2019s draft, is one of the most electrifying players in the game. He was the first overall pick of many fantasy drafts. He\u2019s one of the league\u2019s most marketable stars.\n\nHigh ankle sprains can linger a long time. Even when Barkley returns, it\u2019s possible he doesn\u2019t have the same trademark explosion he showed at Penn State and so far in his NFL career. The Giants will have to be careful with his return, to make sure he\u2019s not rushing back.\n\nUntil then, Jones will be under even more scrutiny.\n\nNew York Giants running back Saquon Barkley stands on crutches in the bench area. (AP)\n\nDaniel Jones takes on more responsibility\n\nJones had a fantastic first start. He threw for 336 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for two more including a late go-ahead touchdown against the Buccaneers.\n\nLife would be easier for the rookie quarterback with Barkley alongside him, but that will take some time. Gallman is solid but very few backs are in Barkley\u2019s class. Jones will have to take a large part of the offense on his shoulders. On Sunday, with Barkley out most of the game, he looked capable of that.\n\nBarkley was happy after the game to report he wouldn\u2019t be out the rest of the season, which indicated this was no minor injury. All the Giants can do is wait for their star running back to heal up.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
