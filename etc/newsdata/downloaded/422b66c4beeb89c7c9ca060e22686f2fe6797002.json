There is nothing about Cohen that can be defended scientifically Dr Thifheli Luvhengo\n\nOne of the researchers contacted by Wits allegedly told the university that its decision to continue using Cohen 60 was based on political and not scientific choices.\n\nThis seems to support the view of Dr Thifheli Luvhengo, a respected medical practitioner, who told City Press last week that there was no science behind the use of Cohen.\n\n\u201cCohen is a bad method. There is nothing about Cohen that can be defended scientifically. It\u2019s a wishy-washy method,\u201d Luvhengo said.\n\nThe row over the use of Cohen 60 was also reported to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane in April to investigate.\n\nHowever, Wits said in July Mkhwebane had decided on a conciliation approach instead.\n\nAsked for an update on that process, Zuma forwarded City Press the same response sent in July indicating that there was a conciliation process under way and a report would be released within six months.\n\nOupa Segalwe, acting spokesperson for Mkhwebane\u2019s office, had not responded at the time of writing.\n\nLuvhengo made a submission to the CMSA and Health Professional Council of SA (HPCSA) about his criticism of Cohen method.\n\nHe said his criticism of Cohen 60 was not confidential and confirmed that the CMSA and HPCSA were aware of his views.\n\nHe said there were people who shared his views and there was a probe under way instituted by the sector to investigate standard-setting methods, not only Cohen.\n\nREAD: Med students take on Wits\n\n\n\nIn his submission seen by City Press, Luvhengo said the aim was to provide background information to the leadership of the country, government, higher education institutions, examination and regulatory bodies and perhaps globally that concerns raised around the use of the Cohen method and its modifications merit an investigation.\n\n\u201cPresumed low-income status and labour intensiveness of preferred and reliable standard-setting methods cannot be used to justify the use of Cohen\u2019s method of standard setting in South Africa. The use of the Cohen method is unfair, unjustifiable and indefensible.\n\n\u201cThe sole purpose of introducing it in South Africa appears to have been to control the pass rate which is known to dramatically improve if the quality of examination is enhanced such as introduction of good SBA [single based answers] and MCQ [multichoice questions] and equalisation of training platforms and teaching exposure,\u201d Luvhengo said.\n\n\u201cIt has however led to apprehension and persistent allegations that improvement of pass rate of black candidates at both basic and higher education levels equates to lowering of academic standards, which puts communities at risk,\u201d he stated.\n\nDr Flavia Senkubuge, president of CMSA, said they have not received Luvhengo\u2019s submission. However, she said the case of the surgeons who failed exams at five universities was not linked to the use of the Cohen method.\n\nTALK TO US Should South African universities reconsider the Cohen assessment method?
