Not Kamala Harris, who did rattle him in the first debate, only to see all of her gains slip away during a lost summer for her campaign. Not Cory Booker, who took on Biden over criminal justice issues later this summer, to no measurable bounce. And certainly not Eric Swalwell, who quickly dropped out of the race after imploring the former vice president to \u201cpass the torch.\u201d\n\nThe past back and forths seemed to inform the strategies of Biden\u2019s higher-polling rivals on Thursday: While Biden was an early aggressor, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren broke with him over the policy but generally declined to offer sharp rejoinders or jump in to attack him.\n\nBut about a half hour into this latest debate, as an early series of questions about health care drilled deep into the candidates\u2019 specific positions, Castro leapt at a chance to contrast his plan with Biden\u2019s.\n\nThe difference between what he supports, and what Biden backs, Castro teased, \u201cis that you require [Americans] to opt in\u201d to a Medicare-like public health insurance option in certain scenarios, like job loss. \u201cAnd I would not require them to opt in \u2014 they would automatically be enrolled.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3263/1155968404_6085827928001_6085823265001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nWith the debate audience watching him, Castro then needled Biden by invoking Barack Obama, arguing that the former president \u2014 and Biden\u2019s much-invoked former boss and ticket-mate \u2014 did not intend to leave 10 million people without health care coverage. \u201cHe wanted every single person in this country covered,\u201d Castro added, with another punch. \u201cMy plan would do that. Your plan would not.\u201d\n\nBiden was ready with a real-time fact-check, suggesting he\u2019d learned from the past exchanges. He was dismissive, but imprecise in his pushback.\n\n\u201cThey do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in,\u201d Biden insisted, as Castro laid in wait.\n\n\u201cYou just said that two minutes ago. You just [said] two minutes ago they would have to buy in,\u201d he responded. Then, he launched into an unmistakable brushback based on Biden\u2019s age.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nCastro paused as the crowd let out a Jerry Springer Show-like round of \u201cohhhhs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in,\u201d Castro continued, to the crowd\u2019s shock. \u201cYou're forgetting that?\u201d\n\nBiden wasn\u2019t having it. He looked disgusted with the exchange, turning away from Castro.\n\nBut the Texan wouldn\u2019t relent. Castro ticked though more details and claimed that he, in fact, was the one fulfilling the legacy of Obama \u2014 \"and you're not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will be a surprise to him,\u201d Biden finally shot back.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only time Castro went on attack. Later in the debate, as the conversation turned to immigration, he slammed Biden for trying to take credit for the positive aspects of Obama\u2019s record, and shying away from the unfavorable parts.\n\n\u201cEvery time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, \u201cOh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that's me, too,\u2019 and then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, \u2018well, that was the president,\u2019\u201d Castro said.\n\nHe even poked at Biden for droning on too long in a later answer.\n\nBut it was the attack over health care that stood out, illustrating the high stakes and dwindling time for low-polling candidates, who are now having to consider riskier tactics.", "description": "The Texan underdog went after the party elder and front-runner with ferocity that some debate attendees thought went out of bounds.", "authors": ["Christopher Cadelago"], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2607/1155968404_6085815684001_6085813667001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
