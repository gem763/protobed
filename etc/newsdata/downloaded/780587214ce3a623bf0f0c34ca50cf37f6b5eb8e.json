He vowed to begin annexing West Bank settlements if he wins national elections next week. (Oded Balilty/AP)\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday repeated his vow to extend Israeli sovereignty to large portions of the occupied West Bank if he is reelected, the latest in a string of campaign promises aimed at winning the support of right-wing voters.\n\nNetanyahu said Israeli annexation of lands that Palestinians hope to gain for a future state would begin with the Jordan Valley, a swath of territory along the border with Jordan that many Israelis see as important for Israel\u2019s security.\n\nThe announcement, which he said reflected coordination with the Trump administration, was the most substantive in a flurry of appeals he has made to religious Jews, West Bank settlers and others in the right-wing camp ahead of the Sept. 17 elections. Opinion polls show Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party locked in a very tight race with the Blue and White party of former army chief of staff Benny Gantz.\n\nThe contest is so close that it could turn on Netanyahu\u2019s success in wresting voters away from smaller, far-right parties, and in recent days he has been hammering at several issues designed to excite and alarm this modest, but perhaps strategic, constituency.\n\nLast week, the prime minister visited the small Jewish settlement in the heart of the West Bank city of Hebron, home to roughly 200,000 Palestinians. Addressing some of the most fervent Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, he vowed that the city would never be \u201cJudenrein\u201d \u2014 the Nazi term for \u201cfree of Jews\u201d \u2014 and pledged to extend \u201cJewish sovereignty\u201d to settlements across the West Bank.\n\nEarlier this week, in an address to English-speaking supporters, he cautioned that an election victory by his opponents could mean Arab citizens of Israel might serve as cabinet members. It was not the first time he had sought to mobilize backers by warning of political gains by Israel\u2019s Arab minority.\n\nNetanyahu on Tuesday returned to the theme of annexing West Bank settlements, where about 450,000 Israelis live in developments \u2014 ranging from large towns to remote outposts \u2014 considered illegal by most of the international community.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, I have led a diplomatic effort to this effect, and the conditions have ripened,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a historic opportunity we may not have again.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said his plan was being drafted in coordination with the Trump administration, which is expected to release its long-awaited Middle East peace plan sometime after the Israeli elections. There was no response from the White House to his announcement.\n\nIsrael has controlled the West Bank since capturing it in the 1967 war. Unlike in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, which were also seized in that war, Israel has never extended its sovereignty to the West Bank, except for some territory near Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu previously promised to annex West Bank settlements, though he had not explicitly mentioned the Jordan Valley, before national elections in April. That vote produced a deadlock, sending Israelis back to the polls for do-over elections next week.\n\nWhether his pledges succeed in influencing the election outcome could depend on whether voters find them credible.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s expecting right-wing voters to believe that suddenly, after all these years he\u2019s been in power and he\u2019s done nothing in this direction \u2014 suddenly, a week before the election \u2014 this is the \u2018historical opportunity,\u2019 \u201d said Anshel Pfeffer, the author of \u201cBibi,\u201d a 2018 biography of Netanyahu. \u201cObviously there will be some people who will swallow it, but it really smacks of desperation.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuildings in the Maale Adumim settlement in the West Bank, on the outskirts of Jerusalem.

(Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nEugene Kontorovich, the director of international law at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a right-wing Jerusalem think tank, praised Netanyahu\u2019s announcement but said credibility was still an issue.\n\n\u201cPromises to do it in the future are not so credible or raise questions about why it\u2019s not being done now,\u201d Kontorovich said.\n\n[Israel\u2019s do-over election this month may yield another deadlock. Then what happens?]\n\nIn some quarters, however, Netanyahu\u2019s campaign pitch may succeed. Some settlers who previously supported far-right parties say they intend to vote for Netanyahu next week.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the right to build here in Hebron. He will give us the right to build, in places stolen by Arabs,\u201d said Aouva Ohayon, 62, who migrated from France to Israel in 1985 and has lived in Hebron for the past two decades. Ohayon is an Orthodox Jew with six grandchildren and teaches in the settlement\u2019s day-care center. She said she typically votes for the Jewish Power party but this time will support Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have so many Arabs around us \u2014 and terrorists \u2014 but we have confidence in God, who protects us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Jewish Power party, whose supporters Netanyahu is courting, is controversial among many Israelis because key figures in the party have been followers of the radical right-wing rabbi Meir Kahane.\n\n\u201cIf you would have told Netanyahu four years ago that he would one day maneuver himself into a situation where his personal and political future depend on supporters of Meir Kahane, he would have laughed,\u201d said Yossi Klein Halevi, a senior fellow at the \u00adJerusalem-based Shalom Hartman Institute.\n\nKahane was an American-born Orthodox rabbi and Israeli politician who advocated for Israel to adopt Jewish religious law and to annex the Palestinian territories entirely. His racist views ultimately caused him to be banned from the Israeli parliament, and he was assassinated in a New York City hotel in November 1990 by an Arab gunman.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s remarks Tuesday were condemned by Palestinian leaders. Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, called on the international community to stop the annexation initiative before it \u201cburies any remaining prospects for peace and a viable and independent Palestinian state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s plan to annex the Jordan Valley, an integral part of occupied Palestinian territories, is manifestly illegal and merely adds to Israel\u2019s long history of violations of international law,\u201d Erekat, a former peace negotiator, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s unprecedented culture of impunity, enabled by international inaction, is the only explanation for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s audacity in using annexation as an election ploy, and asking the Israeli public to facilitate yet another Israeli crime,\u201d said Erekat, who lives in the Jordan Valley.\n\nIn his presentation Tuesday, Netanyahu called on Israeli voters to ask themselves whom they preferred to lead negotiations over the expected White House peace plan: him or his rivals from the Blue and White party.\n\nGantz countered by saying that \u201cthe relationship between Israel and the United States is founded upon common interests and values, and it is stronger than any prime minister.\u201d But he also stressed that he has no intention of seeing Israel relinquish the Jordan Valley: \u201cBlue and White have made clear that the Jordan Valley will be a part of Israel forever.\u201d\n\nThe personal stakes for Netanyahu in the elections could not be higher. Pending a hearing, the prime minister faces indictments in three criminal cases involving fraud, bribery and breach of trust. If he remains in power, he may be able to win legislation in the parliament that would help him evade prosecution while in office. If he loses the elections, his chances for immunity from prosecution are greatly diminished.\n\nRead more\n\nIsrael will hold unprecedented second election after Netanyahu fails to form coalition\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s supporters push a bill to give him immunity as indictments loom\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The vow to extend Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements is the latest effort to woo these strategic voters.", "authors": ["James Mcauley", "Foreign Correspondent Focusing On French", "European Politics", "Ruth Eglash", "Reporter Covering Israel", "The Palestinian Territories", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QipkO39Fq1DhTfSJ6hntiBXkIzk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FX4MTGWUCAI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
