Spot them early enough and you will have more options to get things back on track. Spending up to your credit limits in a short space of time. Borrowing to repay\n\nyour borrowing. Juggling or falling behind with priority bills such as mortgage/rent or utilities. Still being overdrawn after being paid or falling back into the red shortly after being paid. Relying on borrowing to manage a period of unemployment or ill health.\n\n\u201cAt StepChange, we\u2019ve had our busiest start to the year with more people than ever contacting us for debt advice in the first half of 2019. This is cause for huge concern and casts serious doubts on many people\u2019s ability to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.\u201d\n\nHe added these warning signs can no longer be ignored and the Government must act to tackle some of the drivers of debt.\n\nKaren Rowlinson, professor of social policy at the University of Birmingham, who co-authored the report, said: \u201cThe government is saying that austerity is over but our research shows that millions of people are still struggling to pay essential bills. Much more needs to be done to increase income levels to help people make ends meet.\u201d", "description": "Research by University of Birmingham and University of Lincoln has explored debt and how we manage our money", "authors": ["Tricia Phillips", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Eyeem"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20532259.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Worried-young-woman-doing-online-card-payment-on-computer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
