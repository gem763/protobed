In 2000, the first proof of liquid water on Mars was discovered.\n\nIt was claimed the gullies seen on the surface of the planet had to have been formed by flowing water.\n\nScientists cited the debris and mud deposits left behind as evidence for moving water existing at some point in the history of the red planet.\n\nHowever, the formation of these gullies has been hotly debated throughout the ensuing years.\n\nProof of ice in geological samples from Mars\n\nSpirit and Opportunity, the twin rovers, found evidence of the presence of water enclosed in rock in 2007, when one of Spirit's wheels broke and gorged a piece of stone.\n\nAnalysis of the silica-rich layer discovered in the scratch suggested it formed in the presence of liquid water.\n\nIn 2008, the Phoenix lander was gathering geological samples, and they disappeared after a few days.\n\nScientists thought these were pieces of ice. This assessment was confirmed when the lander later detected water vapour in a sample.\n\nIn 2012, Curiosity was meandering over an ancient martian seabed when it examined a number of rocks that were exposed to liquid water billions of years ago.\n\nIn 2012, Curiosity (pictured) was meandering over an ancient martian seabed when it examined a number of rocks that were exposed to liquid water billions of years ago\n\nRecurring slope lineae and debate causes it\n\nFeatures known as recurring slope lineae (RSL) were first identified in 2011.\n\nThese dark streaks populate the areas of Mars with a sharp incline.\n\nResearchers speculated that these may have been caused by the intermittent flow of liquid water down steep banks on the planet.\n\nIn June 2013, Curiosity found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September of the same year, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight.\n\nIn 2015, Nasa claimed to have discovered the first evidence of liquid water on Mars in the present day.\n\nThe space agency said that its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) provided the strongest evidence yet that liquid water flows intermittently on present-day Mars.\n\nIn 2017, Nasa issued another statement rebuking its initial findings.\n\nFeatures known as recurring slope lineae (RSL) were first identified in 2011 (pictured). These dark streaks populate the areas of Mars with a sharp incline. Researchers speculated that these may have been caused by the intermittent flow of liquid water\n\nIt said the dark features that run down steep inclines on the red planet were actually granular flows, where grains of sand and dust slip downhill to make dark streaks, rather than the ground being darkened by seeping water.\n\nImages from the MRO revealed the streaks only exist on slopes steep enough for dry grains to descend the way they do on faces of active dunes.\n\nAlso in 2017, scientists provided the best estimates for water on Mars, claiming it once had more liquid H2O than the Arctic Ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years.\n\nThe findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on Mars to thrive, but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving the surface barren and dry.\n\nA subterranean lake\n\nIn a study published in the journal Science, ESO researchers have now discovered the first concrete evidence for liquid water on Mars.\n\nUsing radar imagery from the Mars Express probe, the ESO team have found a 12-mile long underground lake filled with liquid water.", "description": "This month, NASA released the findings of its newly formed board to revise agency's Planetary Protection policies as more human groups prepare for interplanetary space travel.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/21/20051896-0-image-a-20_1571774810952.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
