Sanders\u2019 team seems to think so \u2013 and they're not alone among Democratic presidential campaigns fuming over fact checkers who appear to give their esoteric policy disputes and faulty recollections the same weight as Trump\u2019s daily whoppers and spreading of self-serving myths like that of millions of fraudulent voters.\n\nThe issue is of no small concern, Democratic strategists say.\n\nTrump\u2019s bold lies and spreading of disinformation \u2013 which have been regularly cited by almost every mainstream news organization \u2013 are a core part of their case against him. But when those same outlets begin parsing Democrats for using questionable data and making exaggerations, they create the impression that everyone\u2019s a fibber. When it comes to lying, Democrats say, Donald Trump has once again broken the bounds of politics as usual, and the media is only helping him by enforcing the old rules.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

A fact-checker at the network rightly pointed out that she only investigated Exxon, while suing other oil companies. Harris\u2019s campaign responded not by challenging the point of fact, but fact-checking itself in the Trump era.\n\n\u201cTrump spent the morning potentially illegally teasing out jobs numbers and lying about a massive hurricane's trajectory, but sure, let's spend our time on whether, as Attorney General, Kamala \u2018sued\u2019 vs. \u2018investigated\u2019 Exxon,\u201d Ian Sams, her press secretary, wrote. \u201cWhen parsing word choice is given the same treatment as intentional lies. . . it blurs the very lines \u2018fact checkers\u2019 are supposed to help keep drawn.\u201d\n\nIn interviews with POLITICO, several prominent fact checkers said they don\u2019t believe their job has changed when it comes to holding politicians accountable for their words on the stump and in TV studios, despite Trump's persistent falsehoods.\n\n\u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right,\u201d said PolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan.\n\nBut this traditional part of the primary vetting process has come under fire in 2020, with critics questioning the utility of highlighting technical errors or disputing policy talking points given the unprecedented volume and frequency of Trump's bogus claims. They've ranged from the dangerous, like spreading unfounded conspiracy theories about the Clintons\u2019 involvement in the death of Jeffrey Epstein, to bizarre, such as insisting he was named Michigan\u2019s \u201cMan of the Year.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Trump era, most fact checks on words uttered by those other than Trump are tantamount to criticizing the captain of the Titanic for not signaling before ramming into an iceberg,\u201d Nathan Barankin, a senior Harris adviser, recently tweeted.\n\nBeyond the Harris team\u2019s gripes, the news media\u2019s focus on former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s factual errors, or gaffes, has drawn comparisons to the fervent coverage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in the 2016 election, while Sanders\u2019 campaign has taken aim at The Post for publishing \u201cfactually inaccurate \u2018fact check\u2019 articles.\u201d That critique has been echoed in progressive outlets like The Nation and The Intercept.\n\n\u201cWhen fact checkers rightly call Trump a liar for saying \u2018the noise (from windmills) cause cancer,\u2019 & then feel obligated to be \u2018balanced\u2019 by calling Bernie a liar for correctly saying Wall Street got a \u2018trillion dollar bailout,\u2019 Democracy Dies in Darkness,\u201d Sanders senior adviser Warren Gunnels tweeted Saturday, appropriating the Post\u2019s slogan while sharing The Intercept story.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Fact Checker team, led by editor and chief writer Glenn Kessler, has catalogued more than 12,000 false or misleading claims made by Trump in office. The president\u2019s tendency to continue making false claims in the face of evidence even prompted them to add the \u201cBottomless Pinocchio\u201d label to its standard scale of one-to-four Pinnochios.\n\nBut their decision to grant the Pinocchios to Sanders\u2019 claim about 500,000 people going bankrupt each year from medical bills provoked a fierce reaction. The Sanders campaign disputed the designation in a letter to the Post\u2019s top editor that also included a demand for a retraction.\n\n\u201cThe overall premise of the piece is absurd,\u201d Gunnels wrote on Aug. 31 to Post Executive Editor Marty Baron. \u201cThe Post\u2019s Fact Checker issued Senator Sanders \u2018three pinocchios\u2019 for accurately citing a peer-reviewed editorial published in the American Journal of Public Health.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what world does this merit one so-called \u2018pinocchio\u2019 let alone three?\u201d said Gunnels, adding that the Post\u2019s rating falsely attacked Sanders, tarnished the reputation of the author of the editorial, and misled \u201cthe public on one of the most serious problems facing the American people.\u201d\n\nPost Managing Editor Cameron Barr responded that the study in question did not determine what causes bankruptcies, as Sanders claimed, but \u201conly factors that contribute to them.\u201d Barr also rejected the campaign\u2019s accusation that there is \u201ca pattern of bias\u201d against it.\n\nBut The Nation\u2019s Jeet Heer suggested The Post\u2019s fact-checking is ideologically slanted, writing that the paper has \u201cfallen into the habit of accusing Bernie Sanders of misleading the public even in cases where the evidence is strongly on the side of the Vermont senator.\u201d\n\nFor instance, Heer noted that the Fact Checker took issue with Sanders for saying accurately in the first Democratic Debate that three billionaires \u2014 Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and post-owner Jeff Bezos \u2014 have \u201cmore wealth than the bottom half of America.\u201d\n\nKessler and his team acknowledged in their June 28 fact-check that Sanders \u201csnappy talking point is based on numbers that add up,\u201d but suggested it\u2019s \u201ca question of comparing apples to oranges.\u201d Because \u201cpeople in the bottom half have essentially no wealth, as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have,\u201d the comparison to Gates, Buffett and Bezos \u201cis not especially meaningful.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, Kessler said he thought the apples-to-oranges point was an \u201cuncontroversial observation\u201d in their round-up of Democrats\u2019 claims during the first debate. Following pushback on Twitter, Kessler updated the post with a response from University of California-Berkeley professor Emmanuel Saez, who he wrote had \u201cagreed with our assessment.\u201d (PolitiFact, for its part, didn't assess whether Sanders' comparison was meaningful or not, but concluded it was true).\n\nKessler said his fact-checking team tries to provide context in addition to adjudicating whether a claim is true or partially true. He acknowledges the Pinocchio scale is \u201cnot scientific,\u201d but said he aims to be internally consistent when providing that \u201cbottom line assessment.\u201d\n\nKessler described the Fact Checker\u2019s mission as writing \u201cabout important issues of policy\u201d and \u201cto provide an entree into demystifying or explaining policy issues to people.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s falsehoods that are deemed to be more trivial may not rise to the level of a standalone fact-check, he said, even though they\u2019re included in the Post\u2019s data base. For instance, Trump\u2019s false claim that Hurricane Dorian was headed for Alabama did not merit a separate Fact Checker analysis.\n\nGiven the Fact Checker\u2019s emphasis on correcting the data behind serious policy matters, rather than blurted-out falsehoods, Democrats running for president are likely to be in its crosshairs throughout the campaign. Kessler noted that they\u2019re now \u201cgetting lots of questions about what Democrats are saying.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post has said it reserves fact-checking for data behind serious policy matters, not blurted-out falsehoods. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo\n\nDemocratic candidates are especially visible right now, with 10 candidates hitting the debate stage on Thursday night in Houston, a week after the same group addressed how they\u2019d tackle the climate crisis during CNN\u2019s seven-hour town hall marathon. CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and his colleagues fact-checked candidate claims at that event, including Harris\u2019s on Exxon.\n\nDale, who began doggedly fact-checking Trump three years ago while a reporter at The Toronto Star, has continued that role since joining CNN in June. He recently broke down the venues in which Trump made more than 328 false claims in a six-week period. Dale and his CNN colleagues found that Trump made at least 22 false claims in Monday's rally in North Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe need to be clear and direct about the fact that there is no equivalence between the frequency of the dishonesty from the president and from anyone in the Democratic field,\u201d Dale told POLITICO.\n\nBut even as Trump has uttered \u201can unprecedented barrage\u201d of false claims by historical standards, Dale said, it \u201cdoes not mean that we abandon fact-checking everyone, that we allow the bar to sink so low that it vanishes.\u201d He said \u201cfacts still matter even if the Democrats are not making up phone calls from the Boy Scouts or misdescribing altered maps when they get things wrong.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact's Holan said the Democrats are currently running against one another and it would be \u201ca huge disservice to the voting public, the primary voters, for fact-checkers to pull their punches in any way.\u201d\n\nHolan suggested primaries were a less partisan time to fact-check than the general election. \u201cThe voters ostensibly are all on the same team,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at the field of candidates. They\u2019re trying to make decisions about which is the best one to represent their interests.\u201d\n\nBut fact-checking during the 2020 Democratic primary, especially relating to Biden\u2019s flubs, has revived criticism of the media from the previous general election. CNN contributor Bianna Golodryga said Sunday on the network that coverage \u201cbrings back memories from how Hillary Clinton was covered and some of the treatment she received.\u201d\n\nBrookings Institution senior fellow Jonathan Rauch recently suggested that the media, in an effort to seek balance, \u201chelps Trump and normalizes his behavior by promoting false equivalents like Hillary's emails and Biden's gaffes.\u201d\n\nBiden has lately faced a flood of negative headlines after several misstatements, from falsely claiming when he began publicly opposing the Iraq war to mangling details of an anecdote about a soldier\u2019s heroism in Afghanistan.\n\nRauch tweeted that the Post\u2019s article on Biden having conflated three accounts into the soldier's story was \u201cpretty innocuous,\u201d and yet he noted it appeared on page one while an article on Trump\u2019s Sharpie-altered map of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s trajectory landed on page 10. (The Post\u2019s article on Biden did mention Trump\u2019s 12,000-plus false or misleading claims in office, though not until the 17th paragraph.)\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s James Fallows agreed with Rauch\u2019s critique and suggested the media have \u201chave to\u201d avoid creating a false equivalence with Trump.\n\n\u201cI think you can see the effects in 2016, where substantial numbers of non-\u2019base\u2019 people thought: What the hell, they\u2019re both crooks (DJT HRC), why bother to get out and vote,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDuring an interview last week with CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert, Biden said \u201cit\u2019s fair to go after a political figure for anything.\u201d Still, he suggested the gaffes he\u2019s made are not about \u201csubstantive issues\u201d and pale in comparison to Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cI don\u2019t get wrong things like, you know, we should lock up kids in cages at the border,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Biden campaign has admitted mistakes, though, such as telling The Fact Checker on Monday that the candidate \u201cmisspoke by saying that he declared his opposition to the [Iraq] war immediately.\u201d\n\nKessler wrote that Biden was \u201con his way to Four Pinocchios until his staff acknowledged that he misspoke.\u201d\n\n", "description": "By assessing Trump\u2019s whoppers and Democratic data disputes in the same forums, they say, the media normalizes the president\u2019s behavior.", "authors": ["Michael Calderone"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7a/dd/1df343af4041a9f8828dbd8c1ec6/190911-bernie-sanders-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
