But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d her prepared remarks read.\n\nThe longtime civil servant said that when she learned of her firing, a superior at the State Department said there had been a \u201cconcerted campaign against\u201d her and that \u201cthe Department had been under pressure from the President\u201d to remove her since last summer.\n\nYovanovitch denied claims that she made disparaging remarks about Trump, which is an allegation some critics of hers passed along to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoDuring deposition, official says he made several efforts to advocate for Marie Yovanovitch Schiff says committees are making 'rapid progress' in impeachment probe State Dept. official broached Pompeo's role in Ukraine in new testimony MORE.\n\n\u201cEqually fictitious is the notion that I am disloyal to President Trump. I have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told the Embassy team to ignore the President\u2019s orders \u2018since he was going to be impeached.\u2019 That allegation is false,\u201d Yovanovitch testified.\n\nFiona Hill\n\nHill, a former top Russia expert at State, testified on what she viewed as a dangerous shadow foreign policy led by Giuliani, Sondland and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyCompany with ties to Trump's brother awarded million government contract: report Kelly says he warned Trump against hiring 'yes man' to avoid impeachment Trump considers selling DC hotel MORE, The New York Times reported earlier this month.\n\nHill, who testified on Oct. 14, told House investigators that former national security adviser John Bolton John BoltonBolton looms large as impeachment inquiry accelerates US restores trade benefit to Ukraine after delay Key witness in impeachment investigation asks federal judge to rule on testifying MORE was so alarmed by news of Trump officials\u2019 Ukraine contacts that he asked Hill to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council (NSC) about such efforts.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton told Hill, according to her reported testimony.\n\nHill also said she believed Sondland created a counterintelligence risk because his inexperience could be exploited, according to a separate report by the Times.\n\nGeorge Kent\n\nKent, a top State Department official, testified on Oct. 15 about efforts by Trump and Giuliani to oust Yovanovitch and get Zelensky to open a corruption investigation into Biden, according to one Democratic lawmaker who offered a series of details about what the diplomat said during his lengthy closed-door deposition.\n\n\u201cWhat I can say is he was clearly bothered by the role Mr. Giuliani was playing and the disinformation he was spreading,\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly Gerald (Gerry) Edward ConnollyDemocrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Speier to run for Oversight gavel Overnight Energy: Watchdog warns of threats to federal workers on public lands | Perry to step down on December 1 | Trump declines to appear in Weather Channel climate special MORE (D-Va.), a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, told reporters after leaving the gathering.\n\nConnolly said Kent, who serves as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, expressed concerns with what he described as an informal alliance between three figures wrapped up in the Ukraine affair who worked in concert against Yovanovitch.\n\nThe individuals included Giuliani; Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's former chief prosecutor; and John Solomon, a former opinion contributor at The Hill, who wrote a series of columns critical of the Bidens.\n\n\u201cLutsenko had his own vendettas \u2014 one of which apparently was to get at our ambassador, to get her out of the way. And he persuaded Giuliani that she was a problem for him too. And then Giuliani then persuaded the president,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cAnd it's sort of this unholy alliance \u2014 or unholy triad \u2014 that somehow managed to seize control of U.S. foreign policy with respect to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn a win for Republicans, Kent also told congressional investigators that he had voiced concerns in early 2015 about a conflict of interest for Hunter Biden to work for Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, a source familiar with the deposition confirmed to The Hill.\n\nThe source said Kent testified that he expressed concerns to an unidentified Biden official about the situation. The official told Kent that Biden didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to focus on Hunter\u2019s business matters because the family was consumed with their other son, Beau, who was battling cancer.\n\nGordan Sondland\n\nSondland in his Oct. 17 testimony further tied Giuliani to the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy towards Ukraine, while also seeking to distance himself from Trump officials\u2019 efforts to get Ukraine to launch two politically motivated probes.\n\nSondland testified that he was disappointed when the president directed diplomats to work with his personal lawyer on such matters, according to his prepared remarks for testimony that were widely disseminated.\n\n\u201cWe were also disappointed by the President\u2019s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani. Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine,\u201d he testified.\n\n\u201cHowever, based on the President\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President\u2019s concerns,\u201d his remarks continue, while condemning any efforts to get a foreign nation involved in a domestic election.\n\nSondland denied knowledge of efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden, saying that he did not make the connection that Hunter Biden served on Burisma\u2019s board \u2014 a statement has raised some eyebrows given published reports and Giuliani's public interviews on the matter.\n\nSome Democrats have claimed Sondland has some explaining to do, suggesting that he may have misled lawmakers during his deposition.\n\nThe wealthy hotelier and GOP mega-donor also maintained that Trump stressed during a phone conversation with him that there was no quid pro quo for the Ukraine financial aid.\n\nWilliam Taylor\n\nTaylor told House investigators that he believed the Trump administration withheld aid to Ukraine in an effort to get Zelensky to launch politically motivated investigations, according to his opening statement.\n\n\u201c[T]he push to make President Zelensky publicly commit to investigations of Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed how the official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the regular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Taylor said in his prepared remarks, which were obtained by The Hill and other outlets.\n\nTaylor also implicated several Trump officials in what he described as a secret, shadowy foreign policy led by Giuliani and Sondland.\n\n\u201cDuring our call on September 8, Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before singing the check,\u201d Taylor told investigators on Oct. 22, in a roughly 10-hour closed-door testimony\n\nLeaving Taylor\u2019s deposition, Democrats called his interview one of the most powerful they have heard so far, while Republicans have sought his attack his record and undercut his testimony as being in conflict with other officials like Sondland.", "description": "A handful of witnesses have already turned over evidence to House Democrats painting what party leaders describe as a damning picture of President Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine into opening politically charged investigations that might benef", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/impeachment_volkerkurt_hillfiona_taylorwilliam_102519gn_getty_as.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
