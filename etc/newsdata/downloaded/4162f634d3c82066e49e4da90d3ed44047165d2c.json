Democrats also planned to require the White House to present information to justify why the administration decided on Doral.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Trump hosted the 2015 Miss Universe competition at the Doral\n\nThe Group of Seven meeting, between Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and the US plus the EU, takes place between 10 and 12 June next year.\n\nThe summit was held at the presidential retreat of Camp David in Maryland, some 60 miles from Washington, in 2012, when it was hosted by then-President Barack Obama.", "description": "The plan to use one of the president's resorts in Florida sparked bipartisan criticism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rb8hq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
