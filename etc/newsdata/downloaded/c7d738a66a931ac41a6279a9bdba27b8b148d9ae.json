And this may well prove valid if it is enjoyed.\n\n(Image: thefitnesschef_)\n\n\"But instances such as the accumulation of 1/2 a peri peri houmous starter, 10 wings, regular chips, macho peas and extra sauce = a caloric intake of 1845 nutrient inclusive calories. But nonetheless... 1845 calories before drinks are considered.\n\n\"Energy balance over periods of time directly defines one\u2019s rate of fat loss, gain or maintenance. Nothing else. \u2063\n\n\"This likely exceeds \u2018would-be\u2019 calories consumed in a parallel McDonald\u2019s visit. Whilst McDonald\u2019s produce is mostly calorie dense, options are limited in comparison to Nando\u2019s abundance of starters, main courses, sides and desserts, not to mention it\u2019s exclusivity as a restaurant - where selection of multiple items is more likely. \u2063Swipe left to see the starters and sides.\n\n(Image: SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gett)\n\n\"That said, Nando\u2019s is enjoyed by millions - this should never change. Awareness of total energy consumed can therefore allow one to facilitate multiple Nando\u2019s excursions into a successful diet.\n\n\"Once the hard nutritional facts of a Nando\u2019s meal are grasped, one can adjust prior and subsequent nutritional intakes to accommodate what will likely be a calorie dense meal in happiness and calm control.\n\n\"Such an eating episode can be free from guilt and enjoyed in serene knowledge that the fruits of the overall diet will yield progress.\"\n\nAnd what about McDonald's?\n\nThere are some options on the menu at the fast-food giant with fewer calories than you might expect.\n\nWhen it comes to burgers, a cheeseburger has 301 calories and a filet-o-fish has 329.\n\n(Image: thefitnesschef_)\n\nHowever the best thing you can order is chicken nuggets with a six-pack containing 259 calories.\n\nA small portion of chips has 237 calories, an Oreo McFlurry has 267 and a the shaker side salad has just 18 calories.\n\nThe most calorific burgers are the Big Tasty with bacon, which has 850 and the Signature Classic which has 689.\n\nGraeme writes: \"For optimal health, excessive consumption of fast food is not going to be particularly beneficial.\n\n\"But if consumption is moderate and accompanied by an overall supportive dietary process, it can have an enjoyed position in one\u2019s life.\"\n\nAccording to the NHS, men need about 2,500 calories a day and women need 2,000, however this can vary depending on age, metabolism and how much exercise you do.\n\nTo learn more about Graeme visit his Instagram page .", "description": "Fitness and diet expert Graeme Tomlinson explains that it's important to treat yourself every now again - and it's even possible to have the odd McDonald's or cheeky Nando's", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Thefitnesschef_", "Sopa Images Lightrocket Via Gett"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758843.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHP_301019SLUG_7349JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
