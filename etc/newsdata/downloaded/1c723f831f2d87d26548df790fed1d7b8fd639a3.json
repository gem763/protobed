We\u2019re talking heavy duty jackets, thick-knit jumpers, and woolly scarves.\n\nBut most important of all, investing in some proper winter boots to keep your feet warm and dry. In our search for the perfect pair, we were looking for durable, watertight shoes with grippy soles.\n\nYou can pick up sturdy boots online or from the high street for under \u00a350. Although if you do fancy splashing out (excuse the pun), don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve picked out some classy, designer options, like a pair of British-made classics favoured by none other than the nation\u2019s favourite secret agent, 007.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

They\u2019re so on-trend, in fact, that these everyday subtle, black hiker boots by Asos are our top pick. These are lightweight enough to chuck into a rucksack just in case it rains, but sturdy enough to stand up to the elements when it does, and you can\u2019t knock \u2018em for the price. We particularly like the black and white detailed laces, thick moulded sole, and elasticated, wetsuit-like ankle seals, which do a sterling job at keeping your trotters dry.\n\nBuy now\n\nSanders & Sanders moss suede hi-top chukka boots: \u00a3205, Sanders & Sanders\n\nSteve McQueen may have made hi-top, chukka boots cool, but it was probably Daniel Craig who introduced them to hip millennials. The blue-eyed heartthrob donned a pair of these exact Sanders & Sanders boots in brown, when he played James Bond in Spectre. Money aside, they\u2019d be our number one pick simply because they\u2019re timeless, comfy and effortlessly stylish. We like the autumnal mossy green but they\u2019re available in eight different colours. Consider a half size bigger as they come up a little small and don\u2019t stress about wearing them when it\u2019s raining \u2013 it\u2019s quality suede so you\u2019ll be grand throughout the winter.\n\nBuy now\n\nZara grey split suede leather ankle boots: \u00a369.99, Zara\n\nEveryone from The Beatles to Kanye West has been spotted in Chelsea boots over the years, and once you\u2019ve added a pair to your shoe stand, you\u2019ll understand why.

It\u2019s the little things in life...\n\nBuy now\n\nRed Wing tan 6\u201d classic moc boots: \u00a3269, Schuh\n\nWe know the price tag is unnerving, but Red Wing is renowned for making proper hardy footwear for both men and women, so you\u2019ll be able to wear these boots for plenty of winters to come. The Minnesotan company, founded in 1905, began making footwear for industrial workforces and has been knocking out quality leather shoes ever since. Although you\u2019re probably more likely to see a hipster strolling through Shoreditch in a pair than a lumberjack in rural USA these days.\n\nThese gorgeous leather moc boots with tidy contrast seams are best worn with a pair of indigo denim jeans or a turned-up pair of light chinos. They\u2019re big fitting so try a size or half-size under, or your heels won\u2019t thank you.\n\nBuy now\n\nDr. Martens vegan 2976 Chelsea boots: From \u00a3139, Dr. Martens\n\nWould any roundup of the best men\u2019s winter boots be complete without a pair of Dr. Martens? Of course not. However, we\u2019ve gone with something slightly less obvious, in the shape of a pair of unisex vegan leather Chelsea boots complete with classic AirWair air-cushioned soles. They look like the real deal, yet no animal products were used in their creation, so you can feel like you\u2019ve done your bit for animal rights.

Step forward the trusty desert boot. Desert boots were popularised by British shoe company Clarks in the 1950s, although now everyone \u2013 from designer brands to high street retailers \u2013 has their own take on this classic boot.\n\nMango\u2019s offering is your first-class ticket to a nonchalant indie look.

A line on the company\u2019s website reads: \u201cYou don\u2019t put on a pair of Danner boots to sit around the house, they\u2019re made for adventure\u201d. We take that to mean stomping around in the rain.\n\nEither way, we\u2019re feeling the spotless details on these black, full-grain leather boots, like the intricate needlework, rounded contrast laces and tiny American flag.
