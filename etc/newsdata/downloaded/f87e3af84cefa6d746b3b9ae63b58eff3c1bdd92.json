And they\u2019ve completely lost touch with reality and the vast majority of voters,\u201d Rouda told me as he sipped a Starbucks iced latte with soy milk just 15 miles from Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cWestern White House.\u201d\n\nWhile the demographic trends show no hint of weakening, it\u2019s an open question whether those disaffected Republicans are, like Rouda, permanently done with the GOP\u2014or whether they can be coaxed back in a post-Trump world. There is a fierce battle already underway, from the marble halls of the Capitol to the beaches of southern California, to decide Orange County\u2019s fate\u2014and, in turn, that of the House majority post-2020\u2026\n\nPoliticians in Orange County, like in many American suburbs, are becoming less dependent on these older white voters for their coalition.
