In recent days, federal prosecutors probing the financier\u2019s sex-trafficking ring have been asking Epstein victims if they could serve as witnesses in the criminal case they are building.\n\nRepresentatives from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York traveled to Florida for an Oct. 15 meeting with several of Epstein\u2019s victims and their counsel. The staffers, who worked in the victim services unit, held a similar meeting in New York on Oct. 23, lawyers for the women and a law enforcement source told The Daily Beast.\n\nTwo people familiar with the investigation said that prosecutors have heard from \u201cdozens\u201d of witnesses or victims since Epstein\u2019s arrest in July.\n\nFollowing Epstein\u2019s death in August, which was ruled a suicide by hanging, the Department of Justice said that it would continue to investigate anyone who helped Epstein procure underage girls or helped him to cover up crimes. A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment on where the probe stands, only saying that the \u201cinvestigation is continuing.\u201d\n\nThe Biggest Bombshells in Newly Unsealed Epstein Documents\n\nSpencer Kuvin, a Palm Beach attorney who represents two women who were abused by Epstein, said the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York offered counseling services to the group of victims who gathered in Miramar, Florida.\n\nThe representatives also worked to debunk conspiracy theories, which the victims have encountered online, related to Epstein\u2019s jailhouse suicide. According to Kuvin, prosecutors continue to battle wild speculation on how the 66-year-old money-manager died, along with rumors that he isn\u2019t dead at all.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office wanted to put to rest some of those conspiracy theories\u2014that he was killed, that he\u2019s still alive. There are people still talking about that,\u201d Kuvin told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere are still people that think this was an absolute ruse and he\u2019s sitting pretty in another part of the world.\u201d\n\nKuvin said investigators assured the women that their probe into Epstein\u2019s alleged co-conspirators was ongoing. The lawyer declined to comment on the identities of those suspected accomplices.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to meet with some of the victims to discuss whether or not they could be potential witnesses in that ongoing investigation,\u201d Kuvin said. \u201cOne of my clients is going to meet with them privately about that issue.\u201d\n\nEpstein Victim: Ghislaine Maxwell Made Me Recruit \u2018Youngest-Looking\u2019 Girls for Epstein\n\nDuring the Florida meeting, coordinators for federal prosecutors answered questions from the women, some of whom felt burned over their treatment 12 years ago, when the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Miami secretly negotiated a cushy plea deal for Epstein. Back then, the feds promised the women they\u2019d prosecute the creepy multimillionaire; instead, they collaborated with his legal team to downgrade the charges.\n\n\u201cThe focus really is: What are you doing now and are you honestly going to pursue the co-conspirators or are those just words?\u201d Kuvin said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been wronged by the system numerous times,\u201d Kuvin added of his clients and other victims of Epstein, \u201cfrom the late 2000s all the way up to him killing himself. Every time an official comes forward and says, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re going to do the right thing,\u2019 they shake their heads and say, \u2018We\u2019ll see.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn New York last week, prosecutors met with victims at a federal building downtown where local FBI headquarters is housed to inform the women of their rights and offer counseling services.\n\nDuncan Levin, a former assistant U.S. Attorney and chief of asset forfeiture at the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, said Epstein\u2019s inner circle shouldn\u2019t rest easy.\n\n\u201cThere is at least some evidence that other people facilitated his crimes, and there\u2019s obviously enough public interest in the case that [prosecutors] aren\u2019t going to drop it just because he\u2019s dead,\u201d said Levin, managing partner at Tucker Levin, PLLC.\n\nLevin said prosecutors are likely to thoroughly investigate Epstein\u2019s alleged enablers and seek forfeiture of Epstein\u2019s properties that were used to facilitate the sex crimes.", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos GettyIt\u2019s been more than two months since Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, but the investigation into possible accomplices is still very much alive.
