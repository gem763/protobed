The world now consumes more than 500 million Tetra Pak containers a day.\n\nMr. Rausing, who died Aug. 30 at age 93, was less successful in his quest to keep a low profile.\n\nWary of kidnapping and other security threats to his family, he was \u201cthe Greta Garbo of the business world,\u201d as he was once described by a newspaper in Britain, his home since the early 1980s. Yet he couldn\u2019t keep himself entirely out of public view.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that he was 6-foot-8, or that his family in 1994 surpassed the Queen of England on the Sunday Times list of the wealthiest people in Britain. Later in his life, the heroin addiction of his son, Hans Kristian, kept the family name in tabloid headlines.\n\nForbes estimated Mr. Rausing\u2019s fortune at $12 billion. In a rare interview with a British paper 18 years ago, he said he understood machinery but not finances and didn\u2019t know how much money he had. \u201cEither you have 20 mistresses covered with diamonds and a Mercedes 500, or you achieve something with your money,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it is a passion to try to develop and create industry in different ways.\u201d\n\nTetra Pak\u2019s containers are best known in the U.S. for individual servings of juice with straws that puncture a foil seal. In Europe and some other parts of the world, they are popular for milk. They also can be used for wine and maple syrup, among other things. Their block shape allows for efficient storage and transportation.\n\nEarly versions were notorious for spilling milk when snipped open with scissors. The company reduced that problem by adopting plastic tabs that can be reclosed.\n\nThe company was founded in 1951 by Ruben Rausing, a Swede who studied economics at Columbia University. Using a packaging concept originated by Erik Wallenberg, Tetra Pak devised machinery to fill long tubes of paperboard with fluid and pinch the material into individual sealed containers. Originally resembling little pyramids, or tetrahedrons, the containers evolved into a box shape.\n\nHans Rausing, Ruben\u2019s second son, was born March 25, 1926, in Gothenburg, Sweden. He studied economics, statistics and Russian at Lund University, where he graduated in 1946. He and his older brother, Gad, joined their father\u2019s business. Hans Rausing became chief executive of the company in the early 1950s.\n\nHe met M\u00e4rit Norrby, a lecturer in medieval German at Lund University. They married in 1958, within three months of meeting. She warned him she disliked cooking. He was happy to take charge of that chore. When their three children gathered clams during summer vacations, he cooked them with dill.\n\nThe Rausings were patient in building up the company, which was unprofitable for more than two decades. In the 1950s, Hans Rausing led bold expansions into undeveloped markets in the Soviet Union and Japan.\n\nHans Rausing moved his family to Britain in 1982, benefiting from lower taxes, and built a single-story home on an estate in East Sussex. The architect, John Outram, described the home as \u201cbuilt like a factory and finished like a palace.\u201d Mr. Rausing created refuges for deer and other wildlife near his home.\n\nAs a privately held company, Tetra Pak was nimble and willing to make long-term bets. Lars G. Andersson, who headed Tetra Pak\u2019s China operations, decided in 1984 the time was right to build a factory there. Mr. Andersson telephoned the company\u2019s headquarters and was transferred to Hans Rausing, who was on a moose-hunting trip. Mr. Rausing approved the idea after a brief chat. \u201cWe could take the biggest of decisions over a lunch break,\u201d said Mr. Andersson.\n\nIn 1991, Tetra Pak acquired Alfa-Laval AB, a Swedish maker of dairy and food-processing equipment, creating what is now known as Tetra Laval Group. Hans Rausing stepped down as chairman in 1993. Two years later, he sold his share of the company to his older brother.\n\nHans Rausing invested in a new packaging company, Ecolean AB, based in Sweden, in 2001. The inspiration for Ecolean\u2019s packaging design, Mr. Rausing said, was the eggshell.\n\nThe family\u2019s philanthropy has included donations to medical research, Cambridge University and a project that seeks to preserve vanishing languages.\n\nThe drug addiction of Mr. Rausing\u2019s son, Hans Kristian, tormented the family for years. In 2012, Hans Kristian\u2019s wife, Eva, who had her own long history of drug addiction, died in the couple\u2019s townhouse in London\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood. Her body was discovered two months after her death.\n\nThe family\u2019s struggle to rescue Hans Kristian from addiction was the subject of \u201cMayhem,\u201d a 2017 memoir by one of his sisters, Sigrid Rausing.\n\nShe also described happier times in her childhood at the family\u2019s summer house, where her father burned the trash at night in a rusted barrel. He and his children watched the garbage burn at night, \u201cglowing fragments of newspaper whirling up in the heat,\u201d Sigrid Rausing wrote.\n\n\u201cSometimes I was afraid of the dark. My father, standing with me by the fire, told me that dark was simply the absence of light. And such was his authority that I believed him.\u201d\n\nMr. Rausing\u2019s survivors include his wife, three children and seven grandchildren.\n\nWrite to James R.
