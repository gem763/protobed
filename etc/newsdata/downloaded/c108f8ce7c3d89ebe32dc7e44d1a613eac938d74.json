Repairs won\u2019t begin until Mr. Di Modica arrives in New York from Sicily at the end of the month to personally oversee the restoration, said Mr. Piccolo.\n\nThe statue, which is 16 feet long and weighs about 7,000 pounds, will likely be repaired over the course of several days at its current location on Broadway in lower Manhattan, just blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nDamage to the \u2018Charging Bull\u2019 will be repaired on site near Wall Street.

His motivations were unclear, the officials said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is the \u201cCharging Bull\u201d sculpture your favorite New York City icon? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Varlack was arrested and charged with criminal mischief and disorderly conduct, according to court records. A judge released him without bail. Mr. Varlack, who faces up to a year in prison, is scheduled to appear in court again on Oct. 21.\n\nMr. Varlack, who lives in Houston, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThough the bull is listed on the Parks Department\u2019s website as a permanent monument, a Parks Department spokeswoman said the agency won\u2019t be paying for the repairs. Mr. Piccolo said that Mr. Di Modica will pay for the repairs himself if necessary.\n\nThe sculpture angered executives of the New York Stock Exchange when it was initially placed in front of the exchange without permission in December 1989. After the exchange paid to have it removed, Mr. Di Modica worked with the Parks Department to have it reinstalled a few blocks away on Broadway, where it has remained.\n\nOthers have left their mark on the bull in the past. It has twice been doused with blue paint, and in 2010 an artist covered the sculpture in a coat made of yarn, a type of graffiti known as \u201cyarn bombing.\u201d\n\nWhat separated Saturday\u2019s incident from the rest, art world experts said, was the violence of the act. Fernando Luis Alvarez, who runs an art gallery that has worked with Mr. Di Modica in the past, said that the yarn stunt was intriguing because it didn\u2019t damage the sculpture.\n\n\u201cBut vandalism is different. Vandalism takes it to a whole different level,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Ben Chapman at Ben.Chapman@wsj.com", "description": "An upstate New York foundry has been retained to repair the \u201cCharging Bull,\u201d the iconic bronze bull sculpture near Wall Street that was damaged over the weekend when a man smashed a metal banjo over its head.", "authors": ["Tyler Blint-Welsh", "Ben Chapman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105451/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
