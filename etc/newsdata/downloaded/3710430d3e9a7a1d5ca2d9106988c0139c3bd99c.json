MO has been down this road many times with cigarettes.\n\nThe fact that President Trump and his administration are trying to crack down on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, while understandable, isn\u2019t really crucial for CRON stock.\n\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 480,000 Americans die each year due to smoking. That\u2019s a staggering amount. However, we haven\u2019t seen cigarettes outlawed as a result of that sad situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the FDA is currently trying to ban the sale of menthol cigarettes, but the tobacco companies will continue to fight the agency\u2019s legal efforts for years to come. Flavored e-cigarettes will likely take a long time to ban.\n\nThe reality is that Altria understands what\u2019s at stake when it comes to vaping and e-cigarettes. They, along with the rest of the industry, are not going to go quietly into the night.\n\nRemember, the NRA isn\u2019t the only trade group in the U.S. with a powerful lobby.\n\nCRON Stock and a Potential Merger\n\nIn recent weeks, Altria\u2019s been negotiating with Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), the owners of the Marlboro brand outside the U.S., to reunite after 11 years as separate companies.\n\nLast October, before Altria bought up a big chunk of CRON stock, I suggested that Philip Morris should make a play for one of Canada\u2019s big cannabis companies.\n\n\u201cThe tobacco companies were born to manufacture and sell the various by-products of the cannabis plant which includes marijuana and hemp,\u201d I wrote at the time. \u201cThe fact that only now are they considering a move \u2014 after legalization in Canada \u2014 suggests they\u2019ve been irreparably scarred by years of tobacco litigation.\u201d\n\nCowen & Co. analyst Vivien Azer recently suggested that the crackdown on vaping flavoring might be the nudge CRON and MO needed to officially tie the knot.\n\nAfter an acquisition, CRON would be controlled by a company with $54.7 billion pf annual revenue and $14.3 billion in free cash flow, providing it with plenty of capital to fight any potential opposition to cannabis vaping in the future.\n\nAltria Has a Beverage Unit\n\nCronos isn\u2019t the only cannabis company with a big focus on vaping. Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) is focusing on vape pens and edibles while ignoring cannabis beverages.\n\nI believe that\u2019s a mistake. Perhaps not a lethal one, but a mistake nonetheless. The older people get, the less they want to be messing with their lungs,. That\u2019s why I think cannabis-infused drinks will win in the end.\n\nAltria, although not nearly as involved in the alcoholic beverages industry as it once was, still owns premium wine producer Ste Michelle Wine Estates. In addition, as a result of Anheuser-Busch\u2019s (NYSE:BUD) $100-billion acquisition of SABMiller in 2016, Altria owns 10% of BUD stock.", "description": "Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) stock fell 5.2% on Sept. 9 as a result of investors' concerns about the cannabis company's focus on vaping products.
