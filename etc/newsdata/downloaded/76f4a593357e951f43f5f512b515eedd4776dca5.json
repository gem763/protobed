The woman texted her husband in the cockpit, asking Captain Joe Weis to come and meet 2-year-old Ki.\n\nWeiss took the child on a tour of the cockpit and then pinned his wings on Ki\u2019s shirt. The token was not the commemorative ones for kids and were the captain\u2019s personal wings from the airline.\n\nThe Orlando Sentinel reported Friday that the delighted toddler clapped and said \u2018thank you\u2019 in sign language.\n\nSarah Klitenick says her son can\u2019t stop talking about his new friend.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An American Airlines pilot retiring after 35 years gave his wings to a Florida toddler with Down syndrome after his final flight.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
