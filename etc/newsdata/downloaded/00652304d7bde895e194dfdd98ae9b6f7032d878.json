Sean Casten (D-IL), Politico acknowledged on October 6.\n\nDuring one of those town halls, an unnamed female \u201craised her voice after Casten criticized Trump\u2019s [July 25] phone call with the Ukrainian president,\u201d Politico reported Thursday.\n\nThe voter told Casten the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint about the call \u201clooks like a bunch of 13-year-old girls gossiping about the person they don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nIn response, \u201cCasten held firm in his criticisms of Trump\u2019s conduct \u2014 often sounding like a liberal Democrat who hails from a blue district, rather than a lawmaker trying to placate both sides,\u201d Politico noted.\n\nThe news outlet described Casten as a \u201cdie-hard\u201d supporter of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn 2018, Casten became the first Democrat to hold the congressional seat of the Sixth Congressional District of Illinois as part of a nationwide Democrat sweep of suburban districts.\n\nHillary Clinton narrowly won Casten\u2019s district in 2016.\n\nDuring the July 25 call, Trump attempted to improperly leverage U.S. aid to Ukraine in return for it investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claimed.\n\nTrump and Unrkainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have denied the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d allegation, which triggered the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe U.S. president has accused White House hopeful Biden of engaging in improper dealings with Ukraine while serving as vice president.\n\nA video ad from Trump\u2019s re-election asserts that Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless the eastern European country fired a prosecutor investigating an energy company. Hunter Biden served on the Ukrainian company\u2019s board at the time.\n\nInternal polling indicates a storm is brewing for vulnerable Democrats in key congressional districts.\n\nPolling by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) shows most voters do not consider the Trump-Zelensky phone call an impeachable offense.\n\nA recent Fox News poll, however, shows a record 51 percent of respondents support the impeachment and removal of Trump.", "description": "Some constituents in Democrat-controlled congressional districts have expressed dismay at their lawmakers' support for the impeachment probe into Trump.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Sean-Casten-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
