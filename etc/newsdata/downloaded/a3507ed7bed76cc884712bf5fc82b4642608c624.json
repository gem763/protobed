We sit indoors for much of the day. Even a trip to the sandwich shop at lunchtime seems a chore in chilly weather.\n\nThis morning, at 2am, the clocks went back.\n\nIt meant an extra hour in bed. But from tomorrow it\u2019ll be dusk, if not night, by the time we are travelling home. Suddenly it\u2019s as if we never see the sun at all.\n\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that many of us get the winter blues \u2013 a general sense of being a bit below par, less productive, and wanting to hide away. For hundreds of thousands of Britons, though, the dark, cold winter months are even more difficult to cope with.\n\nThe change in season also brings with it gradual, creeping depression \u2013 a condition known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It doesn\u2019t usually come on overnight. First, getting out of bed may become a struggle. Then fatigue sets in. Comfort food beckons \u2013 sweet and stodge \u2013 and with that comes weight gain and a further lack of motivation.\n\nOver time, the low mood can get worse \u2013 guilt, anxiety and a desire to be alone may creep in. As one sufferer I know put it: \u2018I feel like all my systems have been turned off in the winter... I\u2019m leaden, and heavy. The fatigue is agony. I have to drag myself from one place to the next.\u2019\n\nAt worst, patients may feel suicidal. So, needless to say, it\u2019s a serious condition. But while there is no cure for SAD, there are things you can do \u2013 starting today \u2013 to help. With a little determination, and by following my simple step-by-step guide, you can stop it from blighting your life.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t taken seriously\u2026 my thesis was taken as a joke\n\nIt was back in the mid-1980s when I first suggested there was a specific type of depression that was triggered by the lack of light in winter. I was working at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, in the US at the time. My thesis was met with a deal of scepticism in the medical community. Although some people supported this new diagnosis, others were dismissive \u2013 contemptuous, even. Some colleagues even thought SAD was a joke.\n\nProfessionally, it was a little galling. More importantly, for a very long time, sufferers found it hard to get taken seriously. Thankfully, more than three decades on, things are different. SAD has won mainstream acceptance and treatment is available on the NHS. One in five Britons are believed to suffer to some extent.\n\nAccording to a recent YouGov poll, symptoms are acute for eight per cent of people. Women are 40 per cent more likely to be affected than men. We don\u2019t know for sure why some people are affected, but we think it\u2019s due to combination of genetics, our biology \u2013 such as hormones and age \u2013 light and stress.\n\nWhile there is no cure for SAD, there are things you can do \u2013 starting today \u2013 to help (stock image)\n\nI noticed I felt slow mentally in winter\n\nIn South Africa, where I grew up, winters were never particularly grim. But on the East Coast of the US, the shifts in weather between seasons was extreme: summers often blistering hot, and winters freezing.\n\nBoth my wife and I felt slower mentally during the darker months. At the time, emerging research suggested that light didn\u2019t just help us see \u2013 it had biological effects.\n\nOne major discovery was the hormone melatonin, which is integral in regulating our sleeping and waking cycles. Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland, which is tucked beneath the mid-line of the brain.\n\nIts activity is regulated by special light receptors in the eyes. Darkness signals the gland to begin secreting melatonin into the bloodstream, making us feel drowsy. Light, as the sun rises, is detected by the eyes, and halts production.\n\nBut the chemical messenger does so much more than put us to sleep. In animals, it governs reproductive cycles. It even governs antler growth in reindeer.\n\nI wondered: did light have other effects in humans? Around this time, I encountered another scientist who suffered mood changes in the darker winter months \u2013 but much more severely than I did. So we decided to carry out an experiment: to see if light therapy could make a difference to his mental health.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the \u2018worried well\u2019\n\nLight therapy \u2013 basically, sitting near a source of very bright light, known as a light box \u2013 is the cornerstone of SAD treatment. But back in the 1980s, no such thing existed. So we rigged together the first prototype, made from a fluorescent ceiling light. These emit what is known as white light \u2013 which is similar to the light emitted by the sun.\n\nIs it the winter blues ...or full-blown SAD? The following are core symptoms of SAD. They develop as the seasons change from summer to autumn and winter: REDUCED energy\n\nINCREASED eating, including carb cravings\n\nDISTURBED sleep\n\nLOWER sex drive\n\nTHINKING problems, such as difficulty concentrating\n\nMOOD problems, particularly depression. If you have some of these symptoms during autumn and winter, and find them problematic, you may well have SAD or subsyndromal SAD. It is common to suffer from SAD alongside other mental health problems, including non-seasonal depression, premenstrual syndrome and eating disorders. Whether or not this is the case, you might benefit from the treatments described on these pages, and in my book Winter Blues. However, it\u2019s always wise to consult your GP if you feel unwell, so they can rule out other causes such as thyroid gland problems and chronic viral illnesses.\n\nMy colleagues Thomas Wehr, Alfred Lewy and I gave our volunteer \u2013 the scientist suffering from seasonal mood changes \u2013 three hours in front of the box before dawn, and three after dusk.\n\nThis simulated the length of a day in summer, in terms of hours of light. Within three days, he began to feel better \u2013 dramatically so.\n\nOver the following years, we gathered evidence and treated more patients suffering from what became known as SAD.\n\nMany sceptics initially argued that we were dealing with \u2018the worried well\u2019 \u2013 people who felt a little down during winter, but had nothing wrong with them. But gradually, the diagnosis of SAD became accepted worldwide.\n\nThere is also what we call subsyndromal SAD, sometimes known as winter blues: when you feel less productive in winter, but not so much that you\u2019d need medical help.Symptoms can vary in severity from one year to the next, and exist along a spectrum. One year a patient might have full-blown SAD and then a less debilitating manifestation the next year.\n\nWe know now these conditions are common \u2013 particularly in places such as England and Scotland. SAD is seen less in sunnier climes, affecting, for instance, just 1.5 per cent of people in Florida.\n\nAnd more needs to be done to raise awareness and alleviate suffering caused by short, dark days.\n\nIn a recent study of more than 1,000 people with SAD, participants suffered, on average, 13 winter depressions before receiving any treatment. Alongside light therapy, we have a wealth of other strategies to tackle the problem \u2013 from lifestyle changes, to medication.\n\nThe key is to start taking steps as the seasons change. That means, if you think you\u2019re a SAD sufferer, you need to take action today.\n\nAnd here is what I advise...\n\nFrom today, as the clocks go back...\n\nMost people with SAD benefit from light therapy. Indeed, studies suggest it is as effective as antidepressants are for non-seasonal depression. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, in most cases, to jump straight to medication.\n\nMany SAD patients will need to start light therapy during October: once the clocks go back, the longer evenings can be a burden.\n\nIdeally, you should have a diagnosis before starting treatment, so your progress can be monitored by your doctor. But if your symptoms are mild, it may be worth giving light therapy a go for up to two weeks, to see if it helps.\n\nTo do so, you\u2019ll need a light box.\n\nThey cost from about \u00a375 from companies such as Lumie (lumie.co.uk) and from SAD.org.uk, which also gives advice on buying.\n\nThe illuminated surface should be at least 1ft square \u2013 smaller boxes have not been proven to be effective. Brightness \u2013 or rather, intensity \u2013 of bulbs are measured in a unit called lux. The average room light is about 300 to 500 lux.\n\nThe amount of light coming from the sun, just as it crests the horizon on a cloudless day, is about 10,000 lux \u2013 and the bulbs in many light boxes emit this intensity of light.\n\nThey should be no less than 2,500 lux and boxes that emit lower levels need to be used for longer.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to stare at it. Just facing it with your eyes open is enough. You can catch up on paperwork or make phone calls as you do \u2013 in fact, I\u2019m sitting in front of mine as I write this.\n\nFor some people five to ten minutes of light therapy, once or twice a day, is all that\u2019s needed.\n\nJust one day of light therapy\u2026 and I felt like my old self again Neina Sheldon, 36, is a copywriter and marketing consultant from Greenside Neina Sheldon, 36, above, describes having SAD as \u2018being like Tigger and Eeyore in one person\u2019. During the summer, the writer from Greenside, near Gateshead, feels \u2018my normal self, upbeat, energetic, motivated and working like the clappers\u2019. But from late September onward, things change dramatically. \u2018It\u2019s like I\u2019m a different person,\u2019 she says. \u2018It starts with feeling tired all the time, and then the low mood kicks in. \u2018I\u2019m pessimistic, have no motivation to do anything, and I become irritable and snappy.\u2019 Neina\u2019s symptoms first began in her teens \u2013 yet it was just put down to \u2018hormones\u2019 at the time. It wasn\u2019t until her early 20s that she visited her GP. \u2018I said, \u201cI know this sounds weird, but I feel like I\u2019m two different people in summer and winter.\u201d \u2018He asked me if I\u2019d heard of SAD, which I hadn\u2019t.\u2019 On her doctor\u2019s recommendation, Neina purchased a light box. She says the effect was dramatic. \u2018It was amazing, like flicking a switch. On day one, after sitting with it for 30 minutes, I had more energy.\u2019\n\nI suggest starting with 20 minutes, and increase as needed \u2013 or decrease if you feel a bit wired, which can happen.\n\nPeople typically end up using the box \u2013 of 10,000 lux \u2013 for between 30 and 90 minutes, broken up into two daily sessions. If you experience side effects such as headaches, eye-strain, irritability or anxiety, insomnia or nausea, decrease the time in front of your box.\n\nSome light boxes emit blue light \u2013 but there are fears they could damage the eyes, whereas all evidence shows that white light is safe in this regard. There is also no evidence that blue is any better than white light.\n\nMost people feel the effects of light therapy within two to four days of starting treatment. However, it\u2019s worth persevering for a week or two to give the therapy a fair try. Some feel a shift in mood after just one session.\n\nI also recommend people with SAD get a device called a dawn simulator. They\u2019re like alarm clocks with bulbs (much less intense than a light box) that gradually lighten at a set time, to gently wake you.\n\nMorning walks... and meditation\n\nLight therapy isn\u2019t the only thing to do this month. I suggest starting a programme of morning walks \u2013 or even jogs \u2013 to take advantage of the morning sunlight. Get outdoors, and look up at the sky (although, obviously, never directly at the sun). Even on the cloudiest of days, there is light.\n\nSome studies suggest combining exercise and light therapy is particularly potent, so building this into your routine is key.\n\nJoin a local walking or running group, or just ask your partner or a friend along. Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation of being a couch potato.\n\nPeople with SAD often have a voracious appetite for carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, potatoes, pasta and rice \u2013 not to mention sweet treats.\n\nOne theory is that carbs boost the effect of serotonin, a brain chemical linked to mood \u2013 which runs low in people with SAD. Stress can also trigger over-eating. Patients often say eating carbohydrates comforts them, \u2018energises\u2019 or makes them feel good \u2013 but this is usually short-lived. And in the long-term, this sort of eating leads to weight gain. I suggest a carbohydrate-restricted diet.\n\nMinimise bread and pasta and try substituting toast and cornflakes at breakfast with something protein-rich such as eggs, or porridge oats, which are slower to digest.\n\nTo counter stress, I am a huge advocate of meditation. I first started to meditate more than a decade ago and found it rapidly made me feel calmer and more able to cope.\n\nI also lost about 8lb over a few months \u2013 I think due to the reduction in stress-driven eating.\n\nSome types of meditation involve repeating a mantra or sound, while others involve focusing the attention on breathing or body sensations. Visit uk.tm.org for more information.\n\nDon't be afraid of therapy or drugs\n\nSome people, despite their best efforts, will not respond to the above measures. Fortunately, SAD can be treated in other ways \u2013 for example, medication or psychotherapy.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, is probably the best option. In fact, research by Dr Kelly Rohan at the University of Vermont suggests it might be effective alone \u2013 even without light therapy \u2013 and it may prevent future bouts of SAD.\n\nThe therapy involves identifying unhelpful thoughts, emotions and behaviours and finding new, more helpful ways of thinking. Your GP should be able to get you a referral, as it\u2019s NHS recommended.\n\nIf you are very depressed, CBT can be difficult and there are alternatives that may be offered.\n\nStarting antidepressants in the autumn, before the onset of symptoms, has been shown in some patients to prevent depression from occurring.\n\nThe drugs can often be tapered and stopped in the spring. So there is a lot you can do now to prepare for the dark months ahead.\n\nDuring this time, avoid extra stress by postponing new projects until spring. Once your symptoms are under control, you might even be able to enjoy small things this winter \u2013 seeing a friend or simply curling up in front of the fire with a book.\n\nAs I wander the streets of my neighbourhood, I always marvel at how different the gardens look from last summer.\n\nThe air has a bracing quality. And remember, by the time the seasons change again, you\u2019ll be ready for a new challenge.\n\nWinter Blues: Everything You Need To Know To Beat Seasonal Affective Disorder by Norman E Rosenthal, \u00a313.99, is published by Guilford Press. normanrosenthal.com\n\n...but clocks going back may prevent heart attack\n\nBy Pat Hagan for the Mail on Sunday\n\nAn extra hour in bed isn\u2019t the only benefit of the clocks going back this weekend. Those additional 60 minutes sleep could, in fact, have a profound impact on your health.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the seven million Britons with heart disease, it could prove life-saving. A recent study by University of Colorado scientists showed that in the two to three days immediately after the autumn time switch, the number of potentially fatal heart attacks drops by roughly 20 per cent.\n\nAnd when the clocks jump forward an hour in the spring, heart attack rates jump 25 per cent almost immediately.\n\nWhy? It\u2019s all to do with the power of sleep. \u2018Most of us can get away with a few late nights but any more than that and you start running up a sleep debt,\u2019 says Dr Neil Stanley, a member of the British Sleep Society and author of the book How To Sleep Well. \u2018If you are repeatedly deprived of your full quota of sleep \u2013 seven to eight hours a night for most of us \u2013 for more than about four weeks, it can become a chronic condition that could threaten your health.\u2019\n\nAn extra hour in bed isn\u2019t the only benefit of the clocks going back this weekend (stock image)\n\nGrowing evidence shows the greatest toll is on your heart.\n\nLast year, a study of 460,000 Britons found that even those without family history of heart disease, who were perfectly fit and healthy, dramatically increased their risk of a heart attack by sacrificing sleep.\n\nThose averaging fewer than six hours a night were a fifth more likely to have a heart attack than those getting seven or eight hours. If they slept five hours or fewer, the risks increased by more than 50 per cent.\n\nProfessor Melvin Lobo, a heart disease specialist at Bart\u2019s NHS Health Trust in London, adds: \u2018It\u2019s not just the time you spend in bed \u2013 it\u2019s the quality of the sleep that counts.\u2019\n\nAccording to experts, poor sleep can trigger a cocktail of other common problems, causing the risk of heart attack to soar. \u2018Being exhausted during the day and awake at night can raise levels of hormones that drive up blood pressure,\u2019 says Professor Naveed Sattar, from Glasgow University\u2019s Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences.\n\nSleep deprivation also upsets the balance of vital hormones in the body that control appetite.\n\nStudies show that eating late at night \u2013 up to two hours before bed \u2013 upsets the internal body clock, or circadian rhythm, which, in turn, disrupts our metabolism. The body is less efficient at processing food for energy, causing spikes in blood sugar and blood pressure. Both of these are known risk factors for heart attacks.\n\nToo little sleep can also harden your arteries. Sleeping six hours nightly was shown, in studies by University of Chicago researchers, to make participants three times more likely to develop fatty deposits in the blood vessels over a five-year period, compared to those who consistently slept for at least eight hours.\n\nBut a daytime snooze won\u2019t help matters. According to recent Chinese research, catching up with shut-eye during the day won\u2019t undo the damage caused by restless nights.\n\nFurther research published in the journal Current Biology in February this year showed that a weekend lie-in is unlikely to help, either.\n\nUltimately, the best defence against sleep-related health problems is simple: a few early nights. Studies consistently show that being early to bed not only protects you from heart disease, but also respiratory illness, psychological disorders and even \u2013 according to some studies \u2013 early death. So, consider setting a bedtime. Your heart \u2013 and overall health \u2013 will be better off.", "description": "Neina Shedlon, from Greenside, purchased a light box and said the effect was 'amazing'.
