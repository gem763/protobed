Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official overseeing Ukraine policy, is expected to tell investigators on Capitol Hill that Trump undermined U.S. national security when he pressured Ukraine\u2019s president during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\n\u201cWhy are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cJust READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER! Ukrain said NO PRESSURE.\u201d\n\nVindman will be the first witness in the impeachment probe who listened in on Trump\u2019s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky. His testimony appears to corroborate both a whistleblower complaint lodged by an anonymous member of the intelligence community who was alarmed by accounts of the conversation, as well as a summary of the call released by the White House.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the Whistleblower? Just read the Transcript, everything else is made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!\u201d Trump tweeted later Tuesday morning, referring to House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the leaders of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the Best Economy Ever, the monumental weekend raid, Tax Cuts, the Rebuilding of our Military, etc.,\u201d the president also wrote, touting the special operations assault that resulted in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. \u201cThe Impeachment Hoax is a disgrace.
