In contrast, calling an election via an amendment to the FTPA, or a separate one-line act, would only need a straightforward majority in the Commons.\n\nThe Downing Street source said: \u201cIf Labour oppose being held to account by the people yet again then we will look at all options to get Brexit done, including ideas similar to that proposed by other opposition parties.\u201d\n\nThe route is nonetheless by no means clear. The Lib Dem-led plan, set out by party leader Jo Swinson on Sunday, would involve Johnson ditching any attempts to push his withdrawal agreement bill through parliament before an election, something the government has rejected.\n\nIf it later became clear that the bill had stalled, Downing Street could agree an election without it, which could win the backing of enough opposition MPs to pass.\n\nThe timetable would be extremely tight. Given the legally mandated five-week delay between the dissolution of parliament and an election, a plan would need to be in place in little more than a week to hold a poll on 12 December, the government\u2019s preferred choice.\n\nThere could also be some jitters within the Lib Dems about giving up on a second referendum. Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP who is now the Lib Dems\u2019 foreign affairs spokesman, said this now did not seem possible without an election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear now that it\u2019s highly unlikely that in this current parliament we\u2019re going to be able to achieve that,\u201d he told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show. \u201cIt looks more likely that you would be able to do that in a new parliament.\u201d\n\nThe change of stance has prompted agitation in the People\u2019s Vote campaign, to which several Lib Dem MPs are allied, with some understood to be not entirely happy at the move.\n\nBut one senior Lib Dem said there seemed to be no option: \u201cWe would prefer a people\u2019s vote but Labour have consistently failed to deliver enough troops to win that fight and, with 19 Labour MPs voting for Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill, we can\u2019t wait around till Labour get their act together, if they ever will.\u201d\n\nThe government has so far avoided seeking an election via a bill because these can be amended, with MPs potentially imposing conditions such as votes for 16- or 17-year-olds, or allowing EU nationals to vote in general elections.\n\nThe Downing Street hope would be that if Johnson gave categoric assurances about a fixed election date, thus ruling out the possibility of a drift into a no-deal Brexit, the opposition parties would pledge not to table any amendments.\n\nHowever, the near-complete lack of trust between the factions in the Commons could still scupper such a plan.\n\nThe immediate focus will be in the Commons on Monday afternoon, where Johnson will challenge Labour to support an election via the FTPA motion.\n\nThe shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said only a promise from Johnson to MPs would suffice.\n\n\u201cHe could come to parliament and categorically give parliament an undertaking that he\u2019s not going to come out without a deal,\u201d she told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show.\n\nWhile Abbott said she would welcome a campaign \u2013 \u201cWe have over half a million members and they want an election\u201d \u2013 the sentiment is not unanimous in the party, with many MPs and a number of shadow ministers wary about agreeing to an election, given recent polls showing the Conservatives taking a lead of up to 16%.\n\nOne senior MP said Labour\u2019s coherence on the issue could be tested if the EU agreed to a 31 January extension: \u201cI get the impression we have quite a unified position as things stand. If the EU granted a long extension, that may change,\u201d the MP said.", "description": "PM may adopt Lib Dem-SNP plan to call an election by a bill or amendment", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/427622fe0fb04a46ccee5500399ede4c75c81f31/0_202_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84a1378d94d6dbc1059a4a11abf41361", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
