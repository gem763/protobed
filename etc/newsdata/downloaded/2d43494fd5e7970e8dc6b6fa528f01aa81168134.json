REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\nChina\u2019s advanced missiles will be a main attraction at the Oct. 1 parade to mark seven decades of Communist China. Many of them are designed to attack the aircraft carriers and bases that undergird U.S. military strength in the region.\n\nAmong them are the so-called \u201ccarrier killer\u201d Dongfeng-21D (DF-21D), unveiled at a parade in 2015, which China says can hit warships at a range of up to 1,500 kilometres, and the DF-26 intermediate range missile, dubbed \u201cGuam killer\u201d in reference to the U.S. Pacific island base.\n\nAttention in state media has focused on the DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile, which can carry several nuclear warheads and reach the United States, forming the backbone of China\u2019s nuclear deterrent.\n\nChina has also made rapid strides in developing hypersonic missiles, known as the DF-17, which theoretically can manoeuvre sharply at many times the speed of sound, further bolstering the reach of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA).\n\nSam Roggeveen, director of the Sydney-based Lowy Institute\u2019s International Security Program, said there was no real workable defence against hypersonic missiles, aside from attacking the launcher, which would mean striking the Chinese mainland. That carries the risk of a nuclear response.\n\n\u201cThe missiles, particularly the medium-range and intermediate-range missiles, are critical to the anti-access and area-denial strategy, which is at the heart of the PLA\u2019s strategy to counter American air and maritime power in Asia,\u201d Roggeveen said.\n\nSTEALTH DRONES\n\nAnalysts are particularly interested in the potential unveiling of two models of stealthy drones during the parade.\n\nChina has a practice of only displaying systems in parades it says are operational, suggesting that if the drones are shown they mostly likely have already entered some form of service.\n\nAnalysis of leaked photos and prototype models leads experts to believe one of them, the Sharp Sword, which resembles the United States\u2019 X-47 series carrier-launched stealth drone, has weapons bays. State media has said the drone had its first test flight in 2013.\n\nMilitary watchers spotted the second Chinese drone, most likely a supersonic or hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft, possibly designated the DR-8, under cover during parade rehearsals. The shape is said to resemble the U.S. D-21 reconnaissance drone of the 1960s, which could travel at more than three times the speed of sound.\n\nBut experts add it will be hard to know how effective the uncrewed aircraft will be or how well the PLA can fit them into its network of other platforms.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to be too serious about some of the equipment that the Chinese might be showing off. Some of them could be experimental or prototypes,\u201d said Richard Bitzinger, a visiting senior fellow with the Military Transformations Program at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\n\u2018OLD FASHIONED THINKING\u2019\n\nChina has said about 15,000 personnel and more than 160 aircraft will be in the procession, making it larger than the last mass parade in the capital in 2015 celebrating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two.\n\nOfficials say Tuesday\u2019s parade is not meant as a \u201cmuscle flexing\u201d exercise.\n\nBut China is facing a tricky strategic situation, boxed in by U.S. allies and military bases near the Chinese coast, including U.S.-armed Taiwan, and repeated challenges to its claims of sovereignty in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nChinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang on Thursday said the world was not a safe place and that the PLA \u201cmust be fully prepared and bide its time for battle.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nMany western military officials and experts say China\u2019s spending on such parades, with their visually stunning choreographed marching, have almost no value for war.\n\nThe sabre rattling may also contradict Beijing\u2019s efforts to project a benign image of China\u2019s growing military, experts say.\n\n\u201cIt shows some old fashioned thinking within China\u2019s armed forces,\u201d one Western diplomat in Beijing said on condition of anonymity.", "description": "China's armed forces are expected to roll out an array of new weapons at a military parade in Beijing next week as President Xi Jinping shows off his ambitious military modernisation programme.", "authors": ["Michael Martina", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434463347&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0JE", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
