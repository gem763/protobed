In addition to feeling undermined by the Justice Department\u2019s ongoing investigation into the Russia probe\u2019s origins, sources also said FBI officials were frustrated with how the Justice Department handled a criminal referral related to a whistleblower\u2019s allegations against Trump, saying it added to a sense that the bureau was being \u201cneutered.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the controversy are Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Biden is one of the 2020 Democratic front-runners and Trump\u2019s chief political rival.\n\nRead more: Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Rudy Giuliani violated foreign lobbying laws in Ukraine\n\nTrump ordered his administration to hold up a nearly $400 million military-aid package to Ukraine in July. A few days later, on July 25, the president had a phone call with Zelensky, during which Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart the US \u201cdoes a lot for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nZelensky acknowledged that and said Ukraine wanted to purchase more Javelins \u2013 a powerful US-made anti-tank missile \u2013 from the US. Trump immediately followed up and told Zelensky he would like Ukraine to \u201cdo us a favor, though,\u201d and investigate Biden.\n\nTrump made no direct mention of the aid package, but his request was alarming enough to White House officials and others on the call that they began discussing how to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the conversation, and White House lawyers immediately began working on damage control, according to a whistleblower complaint a US intelligence official filed against Trump in August.\n\nOfficials are concerned about whether the FBI is being \u2018neutered as an organization\u2019\n\nOne US official who works in counterintelligence told Insider that staff at the bureau were not only \u201cblindsided\u201d by the contents of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky but also frustrated with the Justice Department\u2019s handling of the matter.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the intelligence-community inspector general, and Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, sent the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation because of concerns that the president may have violated campaign-finance laws by asking the Ukrainian government to manufacture dirt on his political opponent.\n\nRead more: Trump says he doesn\u2019t know if Rudy Giuliani is still his lawyer amid reports that Giuliani is under federal investigation\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s criminal division reviewed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and determined that there were no grounds for an investigation of Trump\u2019s behavior. Officials are said to have decided that the White House summary of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky didn\u2019t constitute a campaign-finance violation because he didn\u2019t ask for a financial contribution or an \u201citem of tangible value.\u201d\n\nThey did not interview any witnesses or gather more facts outside of reviewing the summary of the call.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s actions were a departure from the norm because typically, in such cases, the FBI investigates if there was criminal wrongdoing and makes a recommendation to the Justice Department on whether or not to press charges.\n\nHere, the US official said, \u201cthe DOJ made the decision right off the bat, and that was viewed by many as a slap in the face and usurping the FBI\u2019s independence and judgment.\u201d It also added to concerns about whether the FBI was being \u201cneutered as an organization,\u201d the official said.\n\ncaption Trump and Attorney General William Barr. source Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\u2018Everyone says they did their jobs, and yet they\u2019re being accused of treason\u2019\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that all this occurred against the backdrop of Attorney General William Barr spearheading a separate investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.\n\nThere is no evidence that the FBI or the Justice Department acted inappropriately while investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. But Trump and his allies in Congress and the media have long called for an investigation into purported corruption and anti-Trump bias within the Justice Department, which they claim was the catalyst for the Russia probe.\n\nRead more: Ex-Ukraine envoy says she was fired on \u2018unfounded\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019 grounds after standing up to Trump and Giuliani\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger and frustration that this is still going on,\u201d Frank Montoya Jr., a former FBI agent who retired in 2016, told Insider, referring to the continued focus on the bureau\u2019s handling of the investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern among officials that they\u2019re going to get thrown into the blender, that they do all the work and then are ridiculed for it, and accused of facilitating a coup or doing the bidding of the deep state.\u201d\n\nMontoya added that one official told him they believe \u201cthis thing\u2019s going to be open until Trump is no longer president because they want to find something even if there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone says they did their jobs, and yet they\u2019re being accused of treason, and they can\u2019t stand that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt drives them crazy.\u201d\n\nTrump is \u2018fanning the flames of his own political demise\u2019\n\nA former senior FBI official echoed that assessment, telling Insider that fear is a big part of why people at the FBI and the Justice Department haven\u2019t spoken out the way the whistleblower did.\n\n\u201cThis person followed all the established laws and protocol for reporting genuine allegations of misconduct,\u201d the former official said. \u201cAnd still, there\u2019s no real guarantee that even the protections of the law are going to keep their life from being turned upside down.\u201d\n\nThat said, intelligence veterans warn that the president\u2019s apparent lack of awareness of the quicksand he\u2019s in could be his undoing \u2013 it was Trump who ordered the release of the Ukraine phone-call memo that confirmed he\u2019d pressured Zelensky to open an investigation.\n\nRead more: These are the key players you need to know to make sense of the Trump impeachment inquiry\n\nRight now, House Democrats are in the middle of a brewing impeachment inquiry examining Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and his son. The White House has responded by stonewalling Congress at every step by refusing to turn over documents and blocking witnesses from testifying.\n\nBut by obstructing the inquiry, legal experts told Insider last week, the president is giving Congress more reasons to impeach him.\n\nMontoya agreed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fanning the flames of his own political demise,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rope is tightening around his neck, and he doesn\u2019t realize it because he\u2019s too busy enjoying the high.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Officials were stunned not just by the nature of Trump's actions but also by his brazenness, which came months after the FBI closed the Russia probe..
