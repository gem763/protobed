Everyone talked about it, but we're a different team, different players.\"\n\nCurrent England coach Eddie Jones was in charge of Japan at the last World Cup before ex-All Black Joseph took over. He has instilled a huge self-belief and a simple game plan based around ball retention, exploiting the short side and explosive, running rugby.\n\nIt is a pleasure to behold, and Japan's four tries in their final pool victory over Scotland came in a purple patch that represented the most entertaining segment of rugby played so far at the tournament.\n\nThe performance was widely praised and drew many admirers, with former England scrum-half Matt Dawson saying Japan were playing a \"unique\" brand of rugby.\n\n\"The players have really taken over,\" Joseph said of the lead-up to the Boks game.\n\n\"It's a really good time as a coach because when you feel a little bit redundant you know there's real belief and confidence in the team.\"\n\nJoseph made one injury-enforced change to his starting XV, Ryohei Yamanaka coming in at full-back to replace William Tupou, who drops out of the 23 after failing a head injury assessment.\n\nThere are five changes overall to the Brave Blossoms side that lost to 41-7 to South Africa in a World Cup warm-up game in September.\n\nJoseph dubbed that game a \"rehearsal\" and said it was of massive benefit to Japan, a sentiment echoed by Springbok captain Siya Kolisi.\n\n\"It was good to play that game before the World Cup, just to get that monkey off our back,\" said Kolisi, South Africa's first black captain.\n\nThe Bok skipper admitted that the 2015 pool defeat had been \"very tough\", but backed his abrasive side, locked into knock-out rugby from the off after losing their campaign opener to New Zealand.\n\n\"It's something that we never want to go through again,\" he said of the 2015 defeat in Brighton.\n\n\"Now it's a different game again. We are going to have to be at our best again because they have really improved as a team - they are much better now than four years ago.\"\n\nKolisi added: \"Luckily for us, it's been do-or-die since the first game, so we've been in that mindset for a couple of weeks now.\n\n\"We know what needs to be done,\" he said, explaining that the key to a Bok victory was controlling the pace of the game and closing down Japan's exciting outside backs.", "description": "Japan's \"unique\" brand of high-tempo attacking rugby will face the acid test when it runs up against the blitz defence of the Springboks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5544/75abf04920d1480cb6803e908cb6b554.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
