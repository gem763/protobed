At least it was when teenagers Jake Self and Cam Sangster began selling football boots out of their bedroom and garage just outside Torquay.\n\n\u2018We were buying used boots and cleaning them ourselves at home, to make them look as brand new as possible,\u2019 Cam explains. \u2018We were making \u00a340 a pair minimum... but we were selling maybe two or three a week.\u2019\n\nNot bad for two boys, armed only with nail-varnish remover and a few hundred pounds. The money had been reward for passing their GCSEs, the \u2018flipping\u2019 merely a hobby to stop them \u2018scavving off\u2019 their parents.\n\nJake Self (left) and Cam Sangster began selling football boots after passing their GCSEs\n\nThe postman realised what they were doing but three years on, many neighbours are none the wiser. The boxes stack higher now. Their punters come from further afield, too. \u2018RareBoots4U\u2019 supply Karim Benzema, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Xavi, Ivan Rakitic, Joao Felix and dozens of other professionals.\n\nSome boots are so hard to find that their value has skyrocketed. Spurs\u2019 Serge Aurier recently paid more than \u00a3500 for a pair so exclusive that the teenagers would struggle to source them again.\n\nThis is a tale of two friends who stumbled upon a snowball. Now they\u2019re struggling to keep it under control. \u2018Where we were in those days and to look at where we are now, I still can\u2019t really believe it,\u2019 Cam says. Nor can some of the biggest boot suppliers, who have new rivals with fresh faces, fresh ideas and plans to grow beyond this corner of South Devon.\n\nIn December last year, Cam and Jake were on a train when something caught their eye.\n\nArsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is one of a number of Premier League clients\n\nFormer Barcelona and Spain midfielder Xavi has used their services on a number of occasions\n\n\u2018It popped up on my phone,\u2019 Cam remembers. \u2018You get Facebook status memories from years ago \u2014 it was me posting when I was 10 years old, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to go and watch my idol Jack Wilshere play\u201d. On that day I was going to his house to meet him and supply him boots.\u2019 The West Ham midfielder had been their idol, now he was their customer after a bit of help from Arthur Masuaku.\n\n\u2018When we were standing outside his gates, we were nervous as hell,\u2019 Cam admits. They were in a similar state a day earlier, when they met Alvaro Morata \u2014 then at Chelsea \u2014 at a hotel in London.\n\nIt was the first time they had come face to face with a Premier League star. \u2018We were literally shaking,\u2019 Jake remembers. \u2018It was like doing our driving test again!\u2019\n\nThey are still only 19, but they have come a long way already. Having played football together as kids, their lives changed in May 2016, towards the end of their final year of school. \u2018One day we thought, \u201cWe need some money... we love football, we love boots, let\u2019s try to flip a pair\u201d.\u2019\n\nThey began scouring eBay. \u2018We knew they\u2019d be high in demand,\u2019 Jake insists. \u2018We would take a photo on my phone against the wall \u2014 the box, with the boots on top, and we\u2019d upload that on to Instagram with the size, condition and price,\u2019 Cam adds.\n\nWithin a few months, their follower count had spiralled and footballers from League One and Two wanted a piece of the pie.\n\nTheir business model was simple. \u2018We\u2019d get people to post it on their Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and we just built it up,\u2019 Cam says. \u2018The better the pros, the better the shout-outs, the more followers you\u2019re going to get.\u2019\n\nThat worked to a point, and then the match was lit by Chelsea\u2019s Ethan Ampadu.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a local lad,\u2019 Jake explains. \u2018We kind of know him and asked him, \u201cDo you want a free pair of boots in return for a shout-out?\u201d He led us on to David Luiz, from David Luiz we got Alvaro Morata and he\u2019s our main customer now.\u2019\n\nCam continues: \u2018(Morata) has put us in contact with so many players. One morning I woke up and Rakitic was messaging me. I was like, \u201cNah this can\u2019t be real!\u201d\u2019\n\nSoon they took several pairs to the midfielder\u2019s house and he drove them to the Nou Camp for a Barcelona game. Players keep calling because the boots they want can no longer be bought in shops. \u2018Nike and adidas can\u2019t even supply their own players with these boots,\u2019 Cam says. \u2018That\u2019s why they come to us.\u2019\n\nAtletico Madrid striker Alvaro Morata has put the duo in touch with a number of players\n\nSo what began as a pound-shop garage sale has morphed into a phenomenon. Where they get the boots, they won\u2019t say (\u2018Top secret\u2019). But why would players pay for old boots when they are paid millions to wear the newest models? Simple. There\u2019s the \u2018plastic-y\u2019 material of modern boots. And then there are the memories.\n\n\u2018As soon as they see a pair of boots they wore as a kid that they can get brand new again, no one says no,\u2019 Cam says. \u2018We knew what we could accomplish. But we never thought it would blow up.\u2019\n\nIt has, and now Cam juggles the business with his own football career at Plymouth, while Jake recently went full-time.\n\nTheir workload is piling up and they could do with help. But Cam admits: \u2018It\u2019s so hard to understand the boot market and unless you\u2019ve grown up with it and have a massive passion for boots, it\u2019d be impossible to work with us.\u2019\n\nNow they hope extra learning will catapult their earnings to another level.\n\n\u2018For the last year, we\u2019ve taught ourselves business,\u2019 Cam reveals. They have turned to books and podcasts to learn about marketing, time-management and life as a small-business owner.\n\nSangster juggles the boot business with his own football career at Plymouth Argyle\n\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re not worried about copycats. \u2018There are tons out there trying to do the same thing.\u2019 The difference? \u2018They don\u2019t want to put the graft in.\u2019\n\nThough most top players have lucrative boot contracts, the allure of nostalgia is too much for some. Take Benzema. According to RareBoots4U, the Frenchman\u2019s contract with adidas means he incurs a fine every time he doesn\u2019t wear the brand\u2019s newest boots in a match. But that didn\u2019t stop him wearing classic F50s for most of last season.\n\n\u2018Others won\u2019t wear them in games, they\u2019ll only wear them in training,\u2019 Cam adds. \u2018I went to Madrid because when we supplied Xavi, we did a deal with his (marketing) agent,\u2019 Cam continues. \u2018He used to work for adidas and he was saying adidas know who we are. He said, \u201cThey don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing\u201d.\u2019\n\nThey admit they occasionally leave the big names disappointed. \u2018Some of the boots they want are like gold dust,\u2019 says Cam.\n\nBut the dream is to relocate to London and open a warehouse and store. That would bring footfall and consistent sales. \u2018Everyone knows who we are now and we need to be turning that into profits,\u2019 Cam says. \u2018We\u2019re making good money but we need to make proper, proper money.\u2019\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem if they can land one of their prime targets, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo... though Cam admits that may be a step too far.\n\n\u2018We have asked team-mates like Sami Khedira: Can you talk to Ronaldo?\u2019 Jake reveals. \u2018The other day we asked one of PSG\u2019s players to talk to Neymar,\u2019 Cam adds. \u2018He spoke to him and (Kylian) Mbappe and they said they can\u2019t do it because of Nike but they 100 per cent would... that is annoying.\u2019\n\nBased on the last three years, though, RareBoots4U shouldn\u2019t struggle to find customers. \u2018When they see the stuff we post,\u2019 Cam continues, \u2018people don\u2019t realise what we do behind the scenes.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not just getting boots and flipping them,\u2019 Jake adds.\n\nWell, not any more at least.", "description": "It is known as 'flipping'.
