The two fierce rivals still have a game to play against each other after last round\u2019s \u201ccl\u00e1sico\u201d was postponed until Dec. 18 so as not to coincide with a protest by Catalan separatists.\n\nGranada, now in third place, can move to the top of the table if it beats Getafe on Thursday. But the other teams that have jostled at the top of the table so far all dropped points this round.\n\nSevilla could only muster a 1-1 draw at Valencia on Wednesday, while Real Sociedad lost 2-1 to Levante at home. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid was held 1-1 at Alav\u00e9s on Tuesday. Those combined results let Madrid jump from sixth to second place. Barcelona was the only top team to also win in Round 11, thrashing Valladolid 5-1 on Tuesday.\n\nBENZEMA\u2019S BEST\n\nBenzema assisted 18-year-old Rodrygo and Toni Kroos for goals in the sixth and eighth minutes. He set up both teammates with passes into the six-yard box they could use one touch to finish off.\n\n\u201cKarim did what he always does,\u201d said Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. \u201cIt is important that he scored, but he gives us so much more. He makes it so easy for his other teammates to play.\u201d\n\nSerio Ramos added a third from a penalty in the 24th that he was able to repeat after having his initial spot kick saved by goalkeeper Juan Soriano, who was adjudged after a video review to have left his line too early. Eden Hazard set up the chance when he was fouled by Soriano.\n\nMadrid continued to dominate after halftime as Benzema hit the upright shortly before he converted a penalty after Luka Modric was fouled in the box.\n\nThat was Benzema\u2019s seventh goal in La Liga this season, making him the competition\u2019s joint-leading scorer along with Real Betis\u2019 Loren Mor\u00f3n.\n\nSubstitute Luka Jovic scored his first goal since joining Madrid this summer with a header from a pass by Dani Carvajal in the 90th.\n\nLegan\u00e9s remained in last place.\n\n\u201cWe will have to forget this match as fast as we can,\u201d said Legan\u00e9s coach Luis Cembrano.\n\nDRAW AT MESTALLA\n\nValencia got an equalizer in the 81st from substitute Rub\u00e9n Sobrino to salvage the point against Sevilla.\n\nSobrino headed in a free kick from Dani Parejo to cancel out Lucas Ocampos\u2019 strike in first-half injury time.\n\nSevilla lost defender Sergio Escudero to an unspecified injury in the first half. He had to be taken off on a stretcher after colliding with a teammate.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nIker Muniain scored twice to help Athletic Bilbao end a five-game winless streak by beating Espanyol 3-0 at home. His second goal was a brilliant looping strike from outside the area.\n\nNabil Fekir netted a 90th-minute winner to lift Real Betis over Celta Vigo 2-1 in a clash between two teams needing a victory. Betis\u2019 first win in five round extended Celta\u2019s streak to four defeats in a row.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Karim Benzema has Real Madrid right on the tail of Barcelona at the top of the Spanish league.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/spain_soccer_la_liga_99462_c0-177-4242-2651_s1200x700.jpg?8bcc36d5a145d7328b072705ef4a9c5bffac23b0", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
