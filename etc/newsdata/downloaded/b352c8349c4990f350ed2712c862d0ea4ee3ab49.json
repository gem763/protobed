I can\u2019t believe it! 20 years ago, I thought, \u201cThere is no real cool party in New York City and someone has to do this.\u201d And so I did.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019m pressuring myself. It\u2019s not the outside world, it\u2019s really me. I want to outdo myself every year again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m going to have a very hard time walking, and it\u2019s going to take a really long time putting it together.\u2019\n\nBack in August, Heidi shared a video of her body being computer mapped, while last week, she showed off a teeth grill she had specially fitted for the night.\n\nSo, until we get to see Heidi\u2019s 2019 creation, let\u2019s take a look at the Halloween queen\u2019s best looks over the years.\n\n2000 \u2013 Dominatrix\n\nHeidi was a bit more basic in 2000 (Picture: Tom Wargacki/WireImage)\n\n2001 \u2013 Lady Godiva\n\nNow that\u2019s more like it (Picture:Evan Agostini/Getty Images)\n\n2002 \u2013 Betty Boop\n\nWe love this look (Picture: Evan Agostini/ImageDirect)\n\n2003 \u2013 Golden gladiator\n\nWe\u2019re not entirely sure what it is, but A for effort (Picture: Evan Agostini/Getty Images)\n\n2004 \u2013 Witch\n\nHeidi amped up the classic witch look (Picture: Evan Agostini/Getty Images)\n\n2005 \u2013 80s vampire\n\nWas this inspired by Cher?
