How was he allowed to leave Stamford Bridge?\n\nLampard blamed the sheer weight of competition and that is something \u00a358million signing Christian Pulisic is coming to terms with at Stamford Bridge, but the cases of Salah and Kevin De Bruyne provide lessons from which the Chelsea head coach and the American can learn.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHaving been a team-mate of both players, Lampard will be acutely aware that the Blues cannot make the same mistake for a third time by getting to the stage where 21-year-old Pulisic is not given the time or patience at Stamford Bridge that he might be afforded to flourish elsewhere.\n\nLampard is proving himself to be a shrewd operator, as proven by his trust in Chelsea\u2019s Academy graduates, the decision to allow David Luiz to leave and the fact he is getting the best out of Jorginho and Willian - two players who last season became a target of Chelsea\u2019s supporters.\n\nPulisic is currently his biggest problem and yet Lampard\u2019s handling of the winger looks to be the correct approach, as long as he and the player can hold their nerve.\n\nThe great mystery of how Salah never made it at Chelsea has finally been solved by Telegraph Sport and it was Tottenham Hotspur left-back Danny Rose who effectively ended his Blues career before it had properly started.\n\nMohamed Salah's time at Chelsea came to an early end Credit: Action images\n\nFormer Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho had pushed hard for the signing Salah ahead of Antoine Griezmann, who was then at Real Sociedad and had been tracked by Chelsea for some time.\n\nSalah was signed from Basel in January 2014 as the player who was meant to take over from Willian, but struggled to make a quick impact in the more physical environment of English football.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlready frustrated by his first 11 months as a Chelsea player, Mourinho sent Salah on for the final 18 minutes of the New Year\u2019s Day defeat to Tottenham with his team trailing 4-2 in what became a title-winning season.\n\nSalah was hit hard twice by Rose soon after stepping off the bench as Spurs went on to win the game 5-3 and Mourinho returned to work the next day demanding the winger was sold or loaned out immediately. He played once more in the FA Cup defeat to Bradford City before joining Fiorentina and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nDe Bruyne had left Chelsea in the January that Salah had been signed, having lost patience with Mouinho\u2019s treatment of him.\n\nTelegraph Sport can reveal the snapping point came in October 2013, when the Belgian was left out of the squad for a Champions League game against Steaua Bucharest and instead instructed to train with the Under-21s for three days - a week after a poor performance in the League Cup against Swindon Town.\n\nPulisic was last week left out of Lampard\u2019s matchday squad for the Champions League victory over Lille, having struggled to make an impact against Grimsby Town in the League Cup seven days earlier.\n\nPulisic was left out of the squad for the trip to Lille Credit: AFP\n\nBut he was restored to the substitutes\u2019 bench against Southampton on Sunday and managed to set up a goal for Michy Batshuayi after replacing Callum Hudson-Odoi with 10 minutes remaining.\n\nThe match may have already been won at the point, but Pulisic\u2019s impact offered encouragement that he will respond in the right way to Lampard\u2019s tough love.\n\nThe fact Lampard sent him on also offered proof that he will not give up on Pulisic or vindictively punish him in the same way Mourinho did with Salah and De Bruyne.\n\nAsked whether it was difficult to be left out of the Lille squad, Pulisic said: \u201cOf course. You want to play, be on the field and be in the team as much as you can. It hurt not to be there, but I\u2019m happy I got my opportunity against Southampton.\n\n\u201cI want to be starting, I want to be starting every game. I\u2019m working hard in training, I want to be there, I hope everyone can see that, so with moments like this (the assist) I hope I can make a case for myself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just going to throw a fit and give up ever, so if I\u2019m on the bench it doesn\u2019t mean the gaffer doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a part of the team. I\u2019ve just got to keep pushing and earn my spot.\n\n\u201cCompetition in the team can only make me better and I think that\u2019s what makes teams. It\u2019s guys who are maybe not the second or even the third man, but they are pushing each other in training every single day. That\u2019s what a good team is all about.\u201d\n\nGiven the club\u2019s recent history of chewing up and spitting out new signings, it is not surprising that Chelsea fans have already questioned whether or not Pulisic will be the next man to head out of what has too often been a revolving door.\n\nBut Pulisic is trying not to focus on the noise from outside and also insists that he is not hamstrung by the size of his fee, even though Chelsea\u2019s Academy graduates of the same age are being allowed to flourish without the pressure of having to live up to a valuation.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t completely ignore what people say,\u201d said Pulisic. \u201cI don\u2019t live under a rock. I hear things, I see things, but I do my best to block it out. I\u2019m just working hard for myself.\n\n\u201cThe outside opinions don\u2019t matter as much to me as those from inside the team and myself, and the people who care about me. So I\u2019m just going to keep working and do my best, and not worry about it.\u201d\n\nOn living up to his \u00a358m fee, Pulisic added: \u201cThis number doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. Obviously, I go out and try to give my best every time I\u2019m on the pitch. I\u2019m not sure what the price tag means to you, but I just have to keep trying to perform at my best for myself and for the team.\u201d\n\nGiven the form of Mason Mount, Willian and the return to fitness of Hudson-Odoi, Pulisic is likely to need to remain patient after the international break. But if Lampard can show him enough love to keep him keen and the player can grasp more of his chances, however fleeting, then he will not need to follow the path of Salah or De Bruyne.", "description": "Frank Lampard has already faced the question that each new Chelsea coach has been forced to answer since Mohamed Salah joined Liverpool.
