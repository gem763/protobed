Paul Egan of the Detroit Free Press was the first to capture and share the historic moment:\n\nMackinac Island (pronounced \"Mackinaw\") draws nearly a million visitors each year and is regarded as one of the most precious natural resources in Michigan. Just 450 people live on the small destination, and they get around by bike.\n\n\"Bikes are just our way of life,\" Mary McGuire Slevin, the executive director of the Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau, told the sustainable-business news site TriplePundit. \"They are like a part of our bodies, we don't even think about it. When I see a tourist go out for a bike ride around the circumference of the island, you can just tell the difference when they come pedaling back into town \u2014 they are more relaxed and have a big smile on their face.\"\n\nThe Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island.

Along with the lack of cars, Mackinac's architecture is characterized by wood or log-built buildings, mostly from the late 1700s and 1800s.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has dedicated much of her governorship on environmental causes \u2014 particularly on water quality following the Flint water crisis. Many have blamed that crisis, which resulted in at least 12 deaths, on her Republican predecessor, Gov. Rick Snyder.\n\nRead more: A damning new report on the 737 Max blames 'inexperienced pilots' and the low-cost airlines that employ them \u2014 not Boeing\n\nWhitmer's press office told Business Insider that the governor had no comment on Pence's choice of transport and that she hadn't spoken out about it.\n\nBut Democratic US Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who is from Detroit, wrote on Twitter:\n\nSeveral Michiganders reacted to the video of Pence's motorcade by recalling that their state actually played a major role in electing Donald Trump to the White House in 2016 \u2014 albeit, by a narrow margin of 11,800 people.\n\nIt was the first time the left-leaning state threw its support behind a Republican candidate since 1988, when George H.W. Bush won the presidency.\n\nStill, some sympathetic Michiganders said they were fine with Pence's motorcade, arguing that it's a security issue. Alan Tomich, who was born and raised in Michigan, thinks the concern is overblown.\n\n\"I'll bet that the majority of the negative responses are Trump and Republican haters,\" Tomich told Buinsess Insider.\n\n\"Big deal \u2014 he was on the island for a day with probably short trips in a motorcade,\" Tomich added. \"Get over it and worry about important things! I'll bet if that was Obama nothing would have been said.\"\n\nRead more: Andrew Yang is promising to save truck drivers from their demise \u2014 but truckers can't even agree if he's right about their future\n\nRepublican State Rep. Beau LaFave said on Twitter: \"We will not let our VP be in danger because snowflakes think he shouldn't ride in a car.\"\n\nThat take was quickly \"ratioed,\" receiving 2,100 replies over 159 retweets, suggesting that far more Twitter users disagreed with LaFave. Several folks pointed out that Ford's horse-drawn-carriage trip to Mackinac took place 12 years after the Kennedy assassination.\n\nAs Business Insider's Emma Court wrote on Sunday, citing The Detroit News, Pence was on Mackinac Island for the Michigan Republican Leadership Conference, long held there, and told the crowd he had visited Mackinac often while growing up and into adulthood.\n\nAre you from Michigan?
