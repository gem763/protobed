It was more work than I thought it was going to be.\u201d\n\nIn August, Brooks wrote on Instagram that it is \u201cso hard to find cute plus-size maternity fashion while pregnant\u201d.\n\nSize-inclusive fashion brand Universal Standard took heed of the actor\u2019s predicament, collaborating with her to create a clothing range for the label.\n\nBrooks\u2019 latest venture with Universal Standard is a scheme called Fit Liberty, which allows mothers to exchange clothing for a new size for free, whether they are pregnant and need a size up, or whether they are not pregnant and need a size down.\n\nThe Orange Is The New Black star added that one of the biggest realisations she has made throughout her pregnancy is that some things in life \u201care just not that deep\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat has been a wonderful discovery as I enter my 30s, where everything seems so important, especially career-wise. We don\u2019t want to make any mistakes. We want to make sure to pick up every call and do everything, cross every T and dot every I,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTo be able to take a breath, and kind of take in what\u2019s important in life \u2013 family, and friends, and creating memories \u2013 I think that\u2019s the biggest lesson I\u2019ve learned in the past few months.\u201d", "description": "Actor Danielle Brooks has opened up about the difficulties she faced trying to find plus-size\u00a0maternity clothing that she felt \u201camazing and beautiful\u201d in.
