CMCSA, +0.58% announced Wednesday that it would be giving away its Xfinity Flex box for free to those who subscribe to the cable operator\u2019s internet-only plans. With the Flex, customers will be able to watch streaming services on their television sets with a \u201ccurated\u201d interface that highlights live and new programming.\n\nShares of Roku ROKU, -13.71% are off 11% in Wednesday trading, while Comcast\u2019s shares are up 0.2%.\n\nSee also: Apple\u2019s new iPhone 11s mean the two-year upgrade cycle is officially dead\n\nRoku got its start selling streaming-media sticks, and though the company now derives more than half of its revenue from things other than hardware sales, Roku\u2019s newer revenue streams hinge on engagement with the platform. These include advertising revenue, cuts of subscriptions made on the Roku platform, and licensing deals with smart-TV manufacturers. The company said in its latest quarterly earnings letter that its operating system was found in over a third of all smart TVs sold domestically in the first half of the year.\n\nThe announcement of a free competing product from Comcast overshadowed some positive remarks on Roku from the analyst community. Guggenheim\u2019s Michael Morris upped his target ahead of the announcement to $179 from $119.\n\n\u201cAs the company expands its international offering and numerous new streaming video services launch with global growth ambitions, we see under-appreciated opportunity for the company to drive significant economic growth and create value for shareholders,\u201d Morris wrote.\n\nFacebook Inc. FB, +0.03% also made a play in streaming video on Wednesday, unveiling the $149 Portal TV, which lets users project video chats to their television sets as well as watch news programming.\n\nRoku\u2019s Wednesday stock plunge marks the second time in the last two weeks that shares dropped significantly on a competitor\u2019s announcement. The stock fell 10.5% last Tuesday after Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.94% said that it would be giving away a free year of its new Apple TV+ service to those who purchase new iPhones, Macs, iPads, Apple TVs, or iPhone Touch devices. Since the Apple TV+ service will also be available for purchase through Roku, there was concern that Apple\u2019s bundled offering would limit sign-ups through Roku and thus lower Roku\u2019s ability to generate meaningful subscription revenue from the launch. Apple\u2019s pricing for the service, at $4.99, also came in below expectations.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why Roku thinks Apple and Disney will give the streaming platform a big boost\n\nRoku shares remain up more than 300% on the year, as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% has risen 20%.", "description": "Roku Inc.\u2019s massive 2019 rally took a dent on Wednesday after a longtime media giant made a move that undercuts the makers of streaming-media players.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FV767_Roku_w_ZG_20171005200139.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
