Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-AZ), who became the first member of Congress to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) 2016 presidential campaign, announced this week that he will back Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) this time around.\n\n\u201cI think it's a very powerful combination that Elizabeth has,\u201d Grijalva told The Daily Beast ahead of a Thursday event in Arizona where he will introduce the Massachusetts Democrat. \u201cAnd that's that she's got the intellect and more importantly the heart for this job. And that I think she brings in a level of smarts and energy. I think that's what it's going to take to take Trump out. And philosophically, I agree with her.\u201d\n\nGrijalva stressed that his support for Warren was \u201cnot a repudiation of Bernie. This is not an abandonment of the reasons and positions of why I supported him.\u201d\n\nA member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Grijalva said that he was in fact enthused when Sanders and Warren vociferously defended their ideas against a large group of centrist Democrats during the first night of CNN\u2019s 2020 primary debates this week in Detroit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shared constituency there and a constituency that is driven by ideas and their concern for the future,\u201d Grijalva said. \u201cI was very proud. I think it showed that night that there\u2019s some serious leadership and serious gravitas on the part of those candidates.\u201d\n\nWithout naming any other candidates in the field, the Arizona Democrat stressed that he believes the way to defeat President Trump\u2014both in Arizona and the rest of the country\u2014is with bold policy ideas on climate change, the economy, education, and immigration.\n\n\u201cI don't think we're going to beat Trump by working around the edges,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think we're going to beat Trump with nuance. You're going to beat Trump with ideas, strong ideas and somebody that can defend those ideas, communicate them succinctly to people without getting into some academic discussion about each subject.\u201d\n\nEndorsements from members of Congress have been much more diffuse this cycle than last. At this stage in the 2016 race, everyone who had already picked a side supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid. Currently, former Vice President Joe Biden has 16 endorsements while Warren has eight, with the recent additions of Grijalva and Rep. Deb Haaland (D-NM).\n\nWhile Grijalva likes both Warren and Sanders, he noted that another candidate captured his attention during the debates with his answers on immigration: former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nAsked by The Daily Beast, if Warren and Castro would be his perfect ticket, the congressman only let out a hearty guffaw.", "description": "Rep.
