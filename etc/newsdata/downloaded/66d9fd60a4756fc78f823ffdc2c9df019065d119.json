I definitely think it\u2019s going to be exciting and interesting to see how Ash handles her brothers meeting Iqra for the first time.\n\n\"I really hope it\u2019s a happy ending for them and they\u2019re together forever \u2013 but it is EastEnders after all!\"\n\nAsh wasn't the only shocked Walford resident to see her brothers in Albert Square.\n\n(Image: BBC / Jack Barnes)\n\nChantelle Taylor also appeared to see a ghost from her past in the form of Jags, played by Amar Adatia.\n\nJags was stunned when he spotted Chantelle waiting at the bus stop while waiting for her husband and children.\n\nChantelle also seemed to recognise him and stared up in confusion as he walked off with his brother Kheerat.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nGray also appeared to be disturbed by Jags' reappearance later, glaring at him as he took the rubbish out.\n\nLater, Jags confesses to Kheerat, who asks what's wrong with him.\n\nHe says: \"You know that girl I used to date back in school - Chantelle?\"\n\n\"Tall, fit,\" Kheerat recalls. \"I remember you crushing hard for her.\"\n\n\"We had a date,\" Jags hits back.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nKheerat responds mockingly: \"Yeah? Did she know about it? Cos stalking doesn't count.\"\n\nUpset, Jags walks off as his brother calls after him: \"Oh Jags don't be like that. Where are you going?\n\n\"Pub,\" Jags replies.\n\nChantelle has been having an incredibly hard time recently at the hands of her abusive husband and suffered a harrowing miscarriage.\n\nConsidering that Chantelle and Gray have been described as \"childhood sweethearts\", it is highly likely that the three know one another from school.\n\nHow will Gray react to the idea of Jags and Chantelle catching up?\n\n*EastEnders airs tonight at 7.30pm on BBC One", "description": "Ash, played by Gurlaine Kaur Garcha, reveals that she has been trying to protect her relationship with Iqra by keeping her family links a secret", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Bbc", "Jack Barnes"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752764.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EE-Ashs-true-identity-exposed-as-sister-of-gangster-Panesar-brothers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
