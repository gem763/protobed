In August, Bendigo said its annual net profit fell 13.3 per cent $376.8 million as compensation and redundancy costs cut into its financial returns.\n\nIt closed six bank branches, laid off more than 50 full-time equivalents and chief executive Marnie Baker has flagged plans to shed almost 100 more. Meanwhile, its cost-to-income has risen to 57.4 per cent from 55.4 per cent.\n\nAnd, following a decades-long dispute, the Federal Court of Australia recently upheld a challenge to its \u201ccommunity bank\u201d trademark, potentially endangering a central plank of its corporate identity and customer appeal.\n\nThey are serious problems, and ones Johanson is trusting Baker, his successor as chairwoman, Jacqueline Hey, and the executive team to fix.\n\nHis advice is to remember their history and try to resist the temptations of short-term commercial cycles. Or, put another way, that all that glitters is not gold.\n\nThe high cost conundrum\n\nIn a low interest rate environment, all banks face additional pressure on funding costs. As dwindling returns on term deposits and cash accounts send consumers up the yield curve and into riskier investments, the pool of cheap funding and margins naturally diminish.\n\nBut for regional banks that have hitched their wagon to the ideal of community service, alleviating the margin pressure through traditional cost-cutting can be even more difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOurs is a relatively high cost bank,\u201d says Johanson. \u201cWe invest [more than others] in distribution and customer relationship managers.\u201d\n\nClosing branches may be the obvious method of reducing overheads, particularly as fintech challengers and digital-only banks start to become mainstream. Bendigo has also been forced down this path in the last financial year.\n\nBut for Johanson, maintaining a physical presence in the communities they target is an important priority.\n\nWhile he is quick to point out that regional customers do not frequent branches in larger numbers than in the city \u2014 they\u2019re not \u201ctechnophobes\u201d, he says defensively \u2014 Johanson concedes that it is more difficult for a bank like Bendigo to go completely online, lest they get out of touch with their ageing and rural base and lose their strongest competitive advantage in the process.\n\n\u201cWhen Marnie [Baker] goes and watches her son play football in Bendigo, everyone knows who she is,\u201d Johanson says. \u201cThey are quite happy to talk to her on all sorts of different levels. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s one of the reasons why we have been able to keep grounded and that we haven\u2019t given in to some of the temptations that others have.\u201d\n\nThough branches are being closed, Johanson still subscribes to the idea that a physical presence is necessary to build trust between an institution and its customers. His bank is trialling what it calls the \u201cbranch of the future\u201d, with a retail space in the Adelaide suburb of Norwood he says is more \u201ccafe than branch with tellers\u201d.\n\nWhether they serve coffee or not, those physical locations and their staff, not to mention the constant \u201cexperimentation\u201d Johanson says is necessary to survive disruption, come at a high cost.\n\nAnd, as margins are squeezed, the temptation for boards is to appease brokers and analysts and focus on cost reduction above all else \u2014 a decision Johanson says rarely pays off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLearning from pyramids\n\nRunning a bank requires near constant balancing of a range of powerful interests. \u201cEvery marginal dollar you get, in a way there\u2019s a contest,\u201d Johanson says. \u201cDo I give it to employees? Do I put it into the systems? Do I pay depositors a bit more? Do I reduce the costs for borrowers?\u201d\n\nIt is a balancing act that Johanson believes the banking system, and especially the big four competitors that make up the so-called oligopoly, often get wrong.\n\nEquity-based bonuses and incentives for executives have corroded the decision-making matrix in favour of shareholder returns and short-term thinking, Johanson suggests.\n\nHe points to a number of historical examples where he has not regretted resisting the more seemingly profitable option in the short-term.\n\nIn 2006 the bank banned investment commissions for its financial planner network, pre-empting legislation that would not come until the Future of Financial Advice reforms in 2012.\n\nIt also declined to accept subsidised offshore credit as part of the federal government\u2019s Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding in the wake of the global financial crisis, instead opting to build its deposit base from retail customers.\n\nJohanson says this call was inspired by his memories of the Pyramid Building Scheme saga in the early 1990s, which saw the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia and nearly resulted in many depositors losing their life savings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt might have been that we could have grown quicker had we given in to the temptations of volume and price as the levers for building a business,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure today Bendigo and Adelaide Bank is a better business for having made those sorts of decisions.\u201d\n\nTaking the bait\n\nBut Johanson\u2019s board has not always erred on the side of long-term prudence. It has also succumbed to the temptations he says are endemic to the system.\n\nWhile it might have been smart to scrap commissions for financial advisers and move to a professional model years before others were compelled to, the bank\u2019s entry into wealth management in the first place was far less altruistic.\n\nAs the big banks bought wealth management businesses as a means to vertically integrate and cross-subsidise a wider range of banking and financial products, Johanson admits Bendigo lost its nerve.\n\n\u201cThe amalgamation of wealth and banking [across] the industry was in hindsight a mistake,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got into it almost as a defensive thing, we were worried that we would lose banking customers. It would be better it he hadn\u2019t done it.\u201d\n\nThe bank ultimately got out of the wealth business - as the big four are doing now to varying degrees - selling its financial advisory arm to IOOF in April 2019.\n\nBut with $16.7 million spent in the 2018-19 financial year refunding financial planning customers charged \u2018fees for no service\u2019, it was an expensive mistake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou could also make the counter-argument that resisting temptations that would have made the bank more profitable and attractive to shareholders were the real mistake.\n\nBanking analyst Brett Le Mesurier of Shaw & Partners offers a somewhat brutal assessment.\n\n\u201cBendigo is going to have a higher cost-to-income ratio for some time, so the return on equity is going to be compressed relative to the majors,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe prospects of them reducing that ratio are small because of the funding pressures. They may not have the drive to streamline and cut costs.\u201d\n\nOr perhaps resisting that drive is precisely how the regional bank will survive the next 30 years.", "description": "Outgoing Bendigo and Adelaide Bank chairman Robert Johanson reflects on the challenges of managing risk and growth, and the need for branches and technology.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3512%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_690%2C$y_267/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/44b35e44ef1fbc91805eddfe71958fff98c63ea9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
