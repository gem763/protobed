You can\u2019t get access to good health care, good insurance.\n\nIncreased stress could be changing black women\u2019s metabolisms to the point where it becomes more difficult to shed extra pounds, she said.\n\n\u201cI hate when people talk about black women being obese,\u201d Cooper continued. \u201cI hate it because it becomes a way to blame us for a set of conditions that we didn\u2019t create.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s literally that the racism that you\u2019re experiencing and the struggle to make ends meet actually means the diet don\u2019t [sic] work for you the same.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview, Cooper told CampusReform.org she was citing 1990s information from Dr. Arline Geronimus, a public health research professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nGeronimus \u201cargues pretty convincingly that black women have physiological stress responses to racial stimuli and this affects our long-term health,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nI was citing this body of work and the president\u2019s status as a racially polarizing figure that contributes to issues of racial stress for people of color.\u201d\n\nCooper previously criticized the president in August during an appearance on MSNBC.\n\nShe was asked whether Trump was \u201cfeeling the heat\u201d from GOP lawmakers as the president continued a bitter trade war with China, and Cooper responded by saying she worried the president might consider a different type of war to drive the economy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cOne of the ways we got ourselves out of the slump of protectionism in the 1940s was, we entered World War II,\u201d she told host Al Sharpton.\n\nShe added later: \u201cTrump wants one big key thing under his belt. Either he wants his wall or to ride out on the glory of the economy. If he can\u2019t have that, he\u2019s absolutely willing to start a physical war in order to do it.\u201d", "description": "Do President Trump\u2019s policies make me look fat?
