It will keep the same 10.1-inch screen and overall design but overhauls the internals with a new processor, better battery life, and, in a first for an Amazon hardware product, USB-C for fast charging.\n\nAmazon says that the new Fire HD 10 is now 30 percent faster, thanks to a new processor, and it offers 20 percent better battery life, which are big improvements over the old model, if those numbers hold up in the real world. There\u2019s also \u201cenhanced\u201d Wi-Fi, and microSD storage has been expanded to a maximum of 512GB (up from 200GB on the older model). Lastly, Amazon has finally added USB-C to one of its tablets for the first time, which, in addition to being far more convenient to charge, also enables fast charging on the Fire HD 10. There are also some new colors \u2014 twilight blue, plum, and white \u2014 in addition to the standard black.\n\nOn the software side of things, Amazon isn\u2019t changing much. It\u2019ll still run the same customized version of Android as Amazon\u2019s other tablets, although the company is using the launch to roll out a new picture-in-picture mode that will allow you to keep watching video content while in other apps. Right now, only a few apps are supported (like Amazon\u2019s own Prime Video app and Netflix), but more should add support over time. The new feature will launch with the Fire HD 10, but it\u2019ll make its way to the entire lineup in a future software update.\n\nThe Fire HD 10 Kids Edition, Amazon\u2019s child-friendly bundle, now offers a new case (similar to the Fire HD 7 Kids Edition), which features a built-in adjustable stand for easily propping up the tablet. The rest of the Kids Edition perks are still the same: a two-year extended replacement program and a free year of Amazon\u2019s hand-curated FreeTime service, which offers thousands of premium apps, books, and TV shows and movies for kids as well as advanced parental controls for monitoring and limiting time spent in front of a screen.\n\nOne thing Amazon isn\u2019t changing is the price: the new Fire HD 10 will start at the same $149 as the old model, or $199 for the Kids Edition. Both products will ship on October 30th, with preorders starting today.", "description": "The biggest member of Amazon\u2019s line of Fire tablets is getting an update: a refreshed Fire HD 10 tablet, which keeps the same 10.1-inch screen and overall design but overhauls the internals with a new processor, better battery life, and, in a first for an Amazon hardware product, USB-C for fast charging.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-5Khqe-E33vOfIrRmqdPwB7RJNo=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19266310/_DSC4296.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
