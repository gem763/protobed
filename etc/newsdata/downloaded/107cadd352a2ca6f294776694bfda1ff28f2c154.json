The building's owners have been denied a variance for that change. (City of Ottawa)\n\nLarco needed approval from the committee of adjustment for some parts of the building's design.\n\nThe committee is an arm's length panel made up of five residents, and typically deals with minor variances such as residential additions or property severance.\n\nIts decision came after city council had approved the building's heritage application, engineering and landscaping plans.\n\nThat decision is being challenged in court as well.", "description": "The developer\u00a0behind the controversial expansion to the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier is appealing a defeat the project suffered last month.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5209032.1568630277!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/chateau-laurier-addition-version-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
