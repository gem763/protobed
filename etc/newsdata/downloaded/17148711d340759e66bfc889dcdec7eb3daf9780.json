They were even asked if they had any Republican friends during the last question of the night.\n\nThe NBA's controversy started after General Manager of the Houston Rockets Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said he was not willing to comment on China's domestic issues because they have not come up while they're visiting the country.\n\n\"So none of us are perfect and we all have different issues that we have to get to,\" Kerr said. \"And saying that is my right as an American doesn't mean that I hate my country, it means I want to address things right. But people in China didn't ask me about, uh, you know people owning AR-15s and mowing each other down in a mall.\"\n\nLeBron James most recently said Morey acted selfishly, \"We all talk about this freedom of speech, yes, we all do have freedom of speech but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to get into a feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, and spiritually,\" he added.", "description": ".10/15/2019 23:55:24PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/07c2901b-4099-4494-abae-7083c1d746e9.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
