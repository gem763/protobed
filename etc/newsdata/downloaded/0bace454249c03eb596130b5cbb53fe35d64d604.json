Even if we think that only 10%, 20% [of Chinese wealth] is ultimately going to get to the global market we are talking about tidal waves of wealth deployment globally.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Surprise \u00a332bn takeover bid from Hong Kong for London Stock Exchange\n\nHKEX made a surprise \u00a332bn bid for the London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) earlier this month, which was quickly rejected. HKEX has vowed to continue its pursuit despite LSE\u2019s focus on a separate transaction with data group Refinitiv.\n\nFortuitous scheduling meant Li appeared on stage at banking conference SIBOS directly after David Schwimmer, the CEO of LSE. Schwimmer largely avoided talking about the HKEX deal but Li spent half an hour arguing at length about why it made sense.\n\n\u201cOur idea for the transaction is a very simple vision but a very big dream: together we\u2019re going to create an unrivalled global market infrastructure group,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cThis is a time, in our view, when the world is becoming more and more polarised between east and west, the two centres of gravity. We need to have market infrastructure globally that are able to underpin those great two centres of gravity.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: London Stock Exchange rejects \u00a332bn Hong Kong takeover bid\n\nEarlier, Schwimmer had argued that the London Stock Exchange\u2019s partnership with the Shanghai stock market was already fulfilling this dream.\n\n\u201cFor the long term we view Shanghai as the financial centre for China,\u201d Schwimmer said, adding that capital controls preventing Chinese money leaving the country would likely be relaxed overtime.\n\nLi said capital controls \u201cwill continue to be with us in our generation\u201d but Hong Kong had already figured out a way to allow Chinese investors to tap into its market through a series of \u201cconnect\u201d agreements.\n\n\u201cFor every $100 trading, $10 market cap gets created, $1 money actually flows across the border,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is just wonderful news for China because they allow their investors to deploy their international wealth on a global scale.\n\n\u201cIf we can partner with London, all the London products can be in that mall in Hong Kong so that Chinese investors, in the Asian timezone, in their day, they can look at the mall, the mall has Chinese stocks, Hong Kong stocks, Asian stocks, London stocks, European stocks.\u201d\n\nLi said he regretted the timing of the takeover offer, which surprised both the market and the LSE board. Hong Kong had wanted to wait until Brexit was resolved, Li said, but were forced to act when LSE proposed a $27bn takeover of data group Refinitiv in August.\n\n\u201cEvents overtook itself,\u201d Li said, \u201cWe realised it was now or never.\n\n\u201cIf I was sitting in David\u2019s shoes, I would reject Charles Li. I accept that. But I think the opportunity is such that London investors deserve a look at it.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOscar Williams-Grut covers banking, fintech, and finance for Yahoo Finance UK.
