The insurgents routinely issue exaggerated casualty claims.\n\nMujahid said the bomber had been infiltrated into the base well before the attack.\n\nThe latest attack underscored expectations of an escalation in violence following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden cancellation of the talks with the Taliban aimed at withdrawing U.S. troops and ending 18 years of war in Afghanistan.\n\nLast week, a Taliban suicide blast killed at least 10 civilians and two NATO service members near the U.S. embassy in Kabul.", "description": "A suicide bomber targeted an Afghan Special Forces base in Kabul on Thursday, killing at least four commandos, officials said, as violence continued to escalate following the collapse of peace talks between the United States and Taliban insurgents.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
