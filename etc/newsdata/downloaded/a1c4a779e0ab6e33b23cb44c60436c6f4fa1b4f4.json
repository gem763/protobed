However, it was unlikely that the EU\u2019s 27 remaining member states would refuse Britain\u2019s delay request.\n\nGove said government would now step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, including triggering its \u201cOperation Yellowhammer\u201d contingency plans.\n\n\u201cThe risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension, that is why I will later today be chairing a Cabinet committee meeting (...) in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations, our preparedness for a no-deal, is accelerated,\u201d he said.", "description": "Brexit will happen by October 31, British government minister Michael Gove said on Sunday, despite lawmakers forcing Prime Minister Boris Johnson to send a letter on Saturday to the EU requesting a delay.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442969969&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J08M", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
