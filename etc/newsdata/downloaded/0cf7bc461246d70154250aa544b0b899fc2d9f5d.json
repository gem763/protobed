Bush called him after 'Access Hollywood' tape\n\nBilly Bush confirmed in an interview that his cousin, former President George W. Bush, phoned him after the October 2016 release of the blockbuster tape of the former \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host\u2019s infamous exchange with Donald Trump in 2005.\n\n\"He called me, and said, 'You're not laying in bed, are you?'\u201d Bush told CBS News\u2019 Gayle King in a segment that aired Tuesday. \u201cI was like \u2014 I got out of bed \u2014 'No, why would I be laying in bed?\u2019\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBush said he asked his cousin, \u201c'Should I do this? Should I do that? I'm so mad, I should fight back,\u2019\u201d but the former president responded, \u201c\u2018Nope. Just, you know, take what they give you and walk away and work on you.\u2019\u201d\n\nBush was suspended and subsequently fired from his role as a co-host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d after the leak of his conversation with Trump, which upended the 2016 presidential race and featured the future president bragging about sexually assaulting women with impunity.\n\nBut he returned to television after three years on Monday as the new host of \u201cExtra,\u201d telling viewers in his first appearance at the helm of the broadcast that he had \u201clearned a few things\" during his \"time off, or time out.\u201d\n\nBush has previously disagreed with Trump\u2019s characterization of his lewd remarks on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape as \u201clocker room talk\u201d and argued in a New York Times op-ed that \u201cof course\u201d Trump made the controversial comments after the Times had reported the president had suggested in private conversations the recording was not authentic.\n\nStill, Bush insisted during Tuesday\u2019s interview with CBS that he was not angry with Trump for his role in the episode that resulted in the TV presenter being booted off the air while the real estate mogul and former star of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d ascended to the White House.\n\n\u201cNot for that,\u201d Bush said. \u201cNo. I mean he \u2014 he was being him. I think part of that personality and character is why he was successful in a boardroom making people fight over lemonade stands.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: George Bush", "description": "\"He called me and said, 'You're not laying in bed, are you?'\u201d Bush told CBS News\u2019 Gayle King in a segment that aired Tuesday.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/07/f7/50076dda4d3a8ac982c91f86284a/190910-billy-bush-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
