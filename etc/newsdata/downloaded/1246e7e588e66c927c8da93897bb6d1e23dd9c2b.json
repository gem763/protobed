If the cost of living spikes, they\u2019re repaying the loan with money that is worth less than what they borrowed. Others figure they can earn more on the money in the stock market than they owe on their mortgage. This may be true, especially if they\u2019ve got a longer time horizon to ride out ups and downs in these investments.\n\nWorking on this issue with most clients, Mr. Mast keeps coming back to the fact that paying off debt creates a risk-free return. \u201cThat\u2019s really valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019d say, if you\u2019re looking for a good return on your money somewhere else for the next five to 10 years, it has to at least double the rate you\u2019re paying on your loan.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest arguments for not paying off your mortgage is it keeps some cash in your pocket. Assuming you\u2019re not a reckless spender, it can be helpful to have some liquidity in retirement \u2014 both for things you want to do (travel or dining out) and for things you have to do (repairs to your home or cover major health expenses).\n\nWhen major expenses crop up, people sometimes take out a home-equity loan or even a reverse mortgage \u2014 but there are costs involved in securing those, and they\u2019re likely to come with higher interest rates than a primary home loan. As you weigh whether to pay down your mortgage, it\u2019s smart to consider just how liquid your assets are. Mr. Halpern, the Virginia-based adviser, recommends comparing whatever you have in pretax retirement accounts against your after-tax savings.\n\n\u201cIf I have $2 million in retirement accounts and $200,000 in after-tax accounts, that\u2019s a very low liquid number for someone with $2.2 million put away,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s say this person wants to pay off their mortgage. The reality is, a) they probably don\u2019t have enough to pay it off and b) it\u2019s going to leave them with nothing but tied-up money.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a good liquidity number? Mr. Halpern wants to see after-tax money equal to 50 percent or more of a client\u2019s tax-deferred savings. \u201cOf course, it depends on how much money you have and how much you owe,\u201d he added.", "description": "Eliminating debt is a great goal.
