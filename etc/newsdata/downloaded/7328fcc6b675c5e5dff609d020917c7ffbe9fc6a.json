We all saw the images of a woman who covered herself in more than 4 kg of clothing to avoid paying for extra luggage. Now, here are images of a flyer stuffing laptop and wires under her clothes, to appear \u2018preggo\u2019 so that she can avoid baggage fees.\n\nTravel writer Rebecca Andrews attempted to board the Jetstar flight by faking pregnancy but her attempt was foiled.\n\nShe posted an IGTV video on her Instagram, instructing how to wrap up items and stuff them in clothes to avoid the \u00a331 fee.\n\nInstagram\n\nIn the video, she first makes a bundle of cable wires, puts them in another clothing and stuffs that inside her jumpsuit to make it look like a bump. She then places the laptop on her back for \u2018posture\u2019. She then goes on to put another layer of clothes on top and wears a baggy top and voila, she seems pregnant.\n\nHowever she failed. She reportedly said, \"I walked very erectly (TIP: you have to keep your shoulders back, you\u2019ll find out why in a second) to the gate, and found I was the LAST person to board my flight.\"\n\nDon't Miss 590 SHARES 111 SHARES 964 SHARES 22.2 K SHARES\n\n\"Which was my ONLY mistake \u2014 the staff were all paying me attention. Collectively, they weighed my bag, and with smiles gave me the all clear.\"\n\n\"But as I walked my fake-pregnant a** down the gangway, I dropped my ticket and made a noise. So they all looked at me again.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nApparently, when she bent to pick her ticket an airport staff spotted the outline of a laptop on her back. She was confronted and accepted to trying to pass by the authorities in order to avoid paying the fee, which she eventually did.\n\nOne of the subs in her Instagram video read, \u2018If you try this and get busted, this video 100 per cent does not exist. Don't sue me please\u2019.\n\nWell, we got to give it to her for trying though.", "description": "People do all sorts of things to avoid paying extra money at the airport.
