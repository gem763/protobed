More quality, more belief, greater ruthlessness, more goals.\n\nThe damage of a home defeat to Neil Lennon\u2019s men, suffered before the commencement of the last international break, has long been repaired. Now two points clear after winning four league games on the spin, Gerrard\u2019s men have also scored 17 goals and conceded just once in the process.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the way they started, and stalled, at the outset of last season, they are now well and truly motoring.\n\nConnor Goldson celebrates his goal on his side's way to a cruising 5-0 victory\n\nNo one did more to extend that sequence than Jermain Defoe. The veteran turns 37 today and claimed another match ball as an early gift, his reward for a second hat-trick of the season, which took his tally to 12.\n\nConnor Goldson\u2019s header and Borna Barisic\u2019s free-kick, coming either side of the interval, added to the comfort of the victory and the final scoreline in no way flattered the Ibrox side.\n\nWatching from the stand, Craig Levein, whose Hearts side entertain Gerrard\u2019s men on October 20, left the stadium with much food for thought.\n\nAfter the deflation of Bern, Gerrard freshened things up with George Edmundson, Defoe and Greg Stewart in for Filip Helander, Alfredo Morelos and the stricken Ryan Jack. There was never any sense of a hangover from that late Europa League defeat in Switzerland.\n\nRangers legend Paul Gascoigne was in attendance and was in a jovial mood before the match\n\nPenning Accies in from the start, only Brian Easton\u2019s timely intervention prevented Scott Arfield converting on the turn inside four minutes.\n\nAccies\u2019 No 1 Owain Fon Williams then grabbed Goldson\u2019s header to his shirt after an untidy sequence.\n\nIt was plain in the opening seconds that Rangers were at it and Hamilton were all at sea. The only wonder was it took seven minutes for the opener to arrive.\n\nStewart\u2019s intelligent drift inside saw him gather the ball and take out the five-man Accies defence with one swish of his left boot.\n\nDefoe was on his wavelength and the veteran took one touch in which to compose himself and another to clear the advancing Accies keeper with a delightful chip which went in off the post.\n\nBorna Barisic also scored as Rangers convincingly beat Hamilton to go top of the table\n\nMATCH FACTS Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Goldson, Edmundson, Barisic, Kamara, Davis (Polster (65), Ojo (Morelos 73), Arfield (Murphy 65), Stewart, Defoe Substitutes not used: Foderingham, Halliday, Aribo, Katic Manager: Steven Gerrard Hamilton: Williams, McMann, Easton, Stubbs, Fjortoft (Hamilton (69), McKenna, Alston, Gogic, Hughes, Oakley, Beck (Smith 60) Substitutes not used: Miller, Cunningham, MacKinnon, Southwood, Ogkmpoe Manager: Brian Rice Booked: Stubbs\n\nWhatever Accies\u2019 5-3-2 formation was meant to do, it wasn\u2019t working. At times, Rangers played through their opponents at will.\n\nSheyi Ojo drew a save from Fon Williams with a curling effort from the right, then Stewart\u2019s 25-yarder from a central area whizzed a yard wide.\n\nWhen Ojo crossed to the far post, Defoe tried his luck but was denied a second, striking the outside of the post with his volley.\n\nAnxious to atone for his personal nightmare in Bern, James Tavernier was like a man on a mission here.\n\nJust when the first groans of frustration were becoming audible after one misjudged cross too many, he delivered a peach of a delivery to all but kill the contest.\n\nGoldson had fed his skipper with a ball to the right and had continued his run into the box. Fon Williams was helpless as the centre-half caught the cross flush with a header from six yards.\n\nAccies were rarely seen as an attacking force. Although Ronan Hughes did worry Rangers No 1 Allan McGregor with a rising strike and Edmundson charged down Adrian Beck\u2019s effort, those were fleeting moments on the break after the damage was done. Tavernier was only denied his own moment of glory by the outstretched Sam Stubbs with Markus Fjortoft fortunate not to concede a penalty when he handled another measured delivery by the skipper.\n\nThe prospect of Paul Gascoigne (left) making the half-time time draw ensured takings at the food kiosks were not at their usual levels.\n\nFormer Spurs striker Jermaine Defoe bagged a hat trick and was the pick of the bunch\n\nThe Ibrox icon\u2019s return was predictably colourful. An opening yell of \u2018No Surrender\u2019 was followed by some shadow boxing with the mascot and his insistence he\u2019d pulled winning ticket number 999 from the drum. How the fans lapped it up.\n\nArfield really ought to have given them more to cheer about when hostilities resumed.\n\nHaving seen his initial shot saved and Ojo\u2019s follow-up header deflected away, his second attempt went just wide of the far post. By the hour mark, though, any lingering doubts as to the outcome were removed.\n\nStubbs was booked for a crude challenge on Defoe but that would be only half the punishment. Barisic sent the free-kick up, over the wall and in under the bar. What a weapon his left foot is in such positions.\n\nArfield\u2019s reluctance to take a shot on early then allowed Stubbs to prevent the fourth but the goal was only delayed by seconds.\n\nSunday's win puts Rangers top of the Scottish Premiership ahead of arch rivals Celtic\n\nTaking a Steven Davis pass in his stride, Defoe bobbed and weaved his way into the box. Stubbs didn\u2019t do enough to stop him in his tracks, with a finish into the far corner giving the scoreline a more accurate sheen.\n\nDefoe claimed his hat-trick and Rangers\u2019 fifth with 19 minutes remaining. Stewart\u2019s slalom through Accies\u2019 defence was embarrassingly easy. Fon Williams saved but the veteran turned home the rebound.\n\nGerrard was able to give Jamie Murphy his first competitive run-out of the season with Morelos coming on for Ojo.\n\nThe Colombian did his utmost to claim his customary goal in the 16 minutes he was afforded but only forced Fon Williams into one smart save.\n\nThat aside, it was pretty much the perfect afternoon for Gerrard and his players.", "description": "Rangers took advantage after Celtic's earlier defeat to move to the top of the Scottish Premiership.
