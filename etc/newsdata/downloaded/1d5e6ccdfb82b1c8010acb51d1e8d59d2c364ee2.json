They stand precariously on a shelf for almost the entire duration of Tennessee Williams\u2019 little-known 1951 play.\n\nThe shelf is part of an L-shaped tangle of candles and tchotchkes that form a flickering central sculpture of Mark Wendland\u2019s set in this Roundabout Theatre Company production, which opens at Broadway\u2019s American Airlines Theatre on Tuesday night (to Dec. 8).\n\nThis is a play, set in 1950 in a village somewhere along the Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Mobile, running at a gallop. When tragedy comes, it comes with shouting, gales of tears, and catatonia, and when it\u2019s funny the play makes you laugh\u2014a lot. Children run in and out across the stage, and characters make dramatic entrances and exits on a runway spanning the front of the stage, stretching to the left flank of the theater.\n\nThe play, directed by Trip Cullman, swoops in and out of these clashing registers rather as Tomei herself glides around the stage, her own, unpredictable emotional weather system. The stage is boskily beautiful, with a background projection of the sea (at daybreak, sunset, and nightfall) by Lucy Mackinnon, although the mysterious presence of a multitude of pink plastic flamingoes along the back of the stage persists throughout the play.\n\nAround Serafina there is a chorus of women who sometimes seem like friends and sometimes seem like foes. They can sympathize with how unfortunate she is, and then turn on her, and they are led by The Strega (Constance Shulman), a witchy presence who looks half-pirate.\n\nThere is also Estelle (Tina Benko, grand and bright and duchess-y), who comes for Serafina to make a shirt\u2014little does Serafina know who this shirt is for. Serafina\u2019s unseen and soon-to-be-dead husband was unfaithful; in her grief she wills the information into the darkest recesses of her mind.\n\nThe play is about grief, buried betrayal, and bouncy renewal, but Tomei\u2019s exquisite acting also makes it into a head-on collision of tragedy and comedy. She becomes too scared to let her daughter Rosa (Ella Ruib) leave the home. If she is frozen by grief, she does not see why others shouldn\u2019t be too. Grief drives her mute, as well as mad.\n\nAnd then, while Serafina is fighting to find a will to live beyond Rosa, she meets Alvaro Mangiacavallo (Emun Elliott). His name translates as \u201chorse-eater,\u201d and\u2014once she wills herself from the fug of unhappiness\u2014in a wonderfully comic moment, Serafina also recognizes he\u2019s very hot too. He reminds her of Rosario, who, as the title of the play makes clear and the principal characters\u2019 names underscore, had a rose tattoo on his body.\n\nMaybe the rosy-colored flamingoes are an echo of this too, this warm throbbing color of life and promise. Whatever, Elliott and Tomei play their stuttering progress to romance with both flare and sensitivity, as well as for belly laughs. She wants to do something but can\u2019t. He wants to respect her space but isn\u2019t sure she wants him. And their body language tells the audience everything about how hot they are for each other. Rosa too is falling in love with sailor Jack (Burke Swanson), whom her mother mistrusts.\n\nThe play asks how disabling grief can be, how corrosive the memory of abused trust can remain, and how life can go on if only we give it half the chance. Tomei is a transfixing joy to spend time with; her limbs and hair are in a constant state of tossing emotion. Where will she go next, what will she say? Will she cry, scream, shout, laugh, or give us one of her brilliant lascivious side-eyes?\n\nShe is not a merry widow, far from it, but she ensures that it is somehow both moving and hilarious to see Serafina\u2019s return to the world of desire, relationships, and maybe even love. The pink flamingoes may remain a mystery, but Serafina\u2019s journey, thanks to Tomei\u2019s energy and brio, is one you root for.\n\n\u2018Soft Power\u2019\n\nIn January 2016, nearly two months after the Tony and Obie Award-winning writer David Henry Hwang was stabbed in the neck in Brooklyn while walking home from the grocery store, NBC News asked him if the almost fatal incident would color the two-time Pulitzer finalist\u2019s work in the future.\n\n\u201cAs a writer, everything in your life shows up in your work at some point,\u201d Hwang replied. \u201cI bet it is going to change my work somehow simply because it\u2019s now part of my life and your life goes into your work.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, Hwang\u2019s play Soft Power opens at the Public Theater (to Nov. 10), with music and additional lyrics by Jeanine Tesori. Soft Power is not just about the stabbing. Indeed, the stabbing is both central to the musical and also absent and de-centered. One part of Soft Power, as its title suggests, asks what is the power of art on politics. Can they, should they, benefit each other? What is the impact of culture when it comes to the ebb and flow of the power of nations?\n\nAs DHH (Francis Jue), as Hwang is known in the play\u2019s program, lies in a hospital bed, he imagines a witty and pointed musical that uses all the tropes of Broadway musicals\u2014grand, sweeping music, gorgeous choreography by Sam Pinkleton, and beautiful design by Clint Ramos\u2014while audaciously subverting the form and genre.\n\nThe show, directed with a bright, colorful confidence by Leigh Silverman, is inspired by the questionable romantic and cultural politics of The King and I, and so in Soft Power, it is a Chinese character who questions American barbarism, cultural appropriation, and assumptions. And the questioning takes place in the fever dream that Hwang has after he is stabbed and lying unconscious in a hospital.\n\nThe producer X\u016be X\u00edng (Conrad Ricamora), who pre-stabbing has commissioned DHH to write a musical for a Chinese audience, is transformed in the fever dream into an instigator of change in a post-2016 America. He meets Hillary Clinton (Alyse Alan Louis), and they fall in love, and it is he educating her about Chinese language and pronunciation (and eventually even educating the Trump-Pence White House away from guns) that forms the heart of the welcoming topsy-turvy world Hwang imagines.\n\nRicamora and Louis are as charming as an opposites-attract couple as any Broadway pairing. Tesori, as she helped do in Fun Home, has a wonderful knack of creating a lush melody, spiked with very pointed, political point-making. Louis finds angles on the Clinton character that feel fresh. A wonderful scene sees her, post-loss, ensconced with pizza and a metaphorical \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign around her neck.\n\n\u201c \u2018Soft Power\u2019 ranges everywhere through time and across themes of personal and political displacement, in and out of its different fictional worlds. \u201d\n\nIn Soft Power, there is an intriguing contradiction between the lushness of what you are looking at and the layered and complex cultural drama you are watching. We spin far ahead into the future, where the musical-within-a-play has become a classic, and where the Chinese look upon Americans with pity at their hoary cultural artifacts.\n\nSoft Power ranges everywhere through time and across themes of personal and political displacement, in and out of its different fictional worlds. Its focus can feel woolly and puzzling (and we seem to leave Hwang and his stabbing in a too-long dramatic limbo), but its mischief and intelligence powerfully root it.\n\nEvery fever dream must come to an end, and so it is with Soft Power. We return to Hwang\u2019s stabbing, and the cold present-day of racism and hate-stirring. Hwang\u2019s attacker, we learn, has never been caught, but in Soft Power he has crafted more than a graphic personal confessional.\n\nInstead, this is a play with music that asks us to confront not just our ignorance and limitations, but also to listen and learn\u2014hard. The play ends on a note of qualified hope, or more precisely the notion of recovery, Hwang\u2019s and America\u2019s. The healing process, Soft Power suggests, can be as painful as it is colorful and illuminating. Most importantly, it requires the patient\u2019s engagement and determination.", "description": "Marisa Tomei is brilliant as a widow who is grief-stricken, then falls in lust in \u2018The Rose Tattoo.\u2019 And David Henry Hwang\u2019s \u2018Soft Power\u2019 is about his stabbing and cultural change.", "authors": ["Tim Teeman", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571187032/191015-Teeman-Rose-tattoo-Tomei-tease_dl7f5r", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
