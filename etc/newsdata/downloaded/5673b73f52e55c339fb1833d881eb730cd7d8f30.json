And while the results suggest that this chip may not deliver the stratospheric improvements that the 2nd-gen chip did compared to the original silicon, it's more than enough to stay ahead of Intel's flagship chip.\n\nMust read: iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max: What are the differences?\n\nThe results, which allegedly are for the 32-core Threadripper 3000, were spotted over on Twitter by momomo-us over on Twitter.\n\nGeekbench 5\n\nAMD Sharkstoothhttps://t.co/mvEBMCHfIZ \u2014 188\u53f7 (@momomo_us) September 18, 2019\n\nThis fits in well with a benchmark spotted back in August. This showed the Threadripper 3000 as having a 3.6GHz base clock and 4.2GHz boost.\n\nThe single-core score of 1,275 is pretty much the same as for the current flagship Threadripper 2990WX, and is actually slightly lower than the 1,334 that the Intel i9-9900K scores.\n\nBut when it comes to multi-core, the Threadripper 3000's score of 23,015 absolutely destroys the Threadripper 2990WX's score of 13,400, and leaves the i9-9900K with its score of 8,726 in its dust.\n\nSome back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that based on this benchmark that the Threadripper 3000 is some 70 percent faster than the Threadripper 2990WX. However, as usual, caution is needed when trying to extrapolate benchmark results and translate them into real-world performance.\n\nSee also:", "description": "You want more performance?
