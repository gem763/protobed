Although 31 structures were damaged or destroyed, fire officials said their crews managed to save thousands of dwellings while carving containment lines around 13 percent of the fire\u2019s perimeter.\n\nU.S. Representative Brad Sherman told Reuters he was among residents who fled as flames approached.\n\n\u201cI left a bit earlier than most because I was watching the news and the moment they posted on the internet that I was in the mandatory evacuation area, I was out,\u201d Sherman said by mobile phone as he walked back to check on his home in the Porter Ranch suburb.\n\nThe conflagration was stoked by strong, dry Santa Ana winds blowing into Los Angeles from desert areas to the east. Those winds were moving flames at a rate of 800 acres (325 hectares) per hour at the fire\u2019s height, city fire officials told a morning news conference.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dynamic fire,\u201d Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas told reporters, urging residents in harm\u2019s way to heed evacuation orders. \u201cDo not wait to leave.\u201d\n\nThe cause of the blaze was under investigation.\n\n\u2018DON\u2019T BE FOOLED\u2019\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Deputy Dave Richardson cautioned that an apparent lull in fire activity on Friday afternoon should not create a false sense of security.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for additional growth of this fire.\u201d\n\nSome 23,000 homes and around 100,000 residents were under mandatory evacuation orders from the Saddleridge fire early on Friday. Many evacuees were left to wonder whether their homes were still standing.\n\nBy Friday evening, the Los Angeles Fire Department said it was lifting evacuation orders for some areas farthest from the flames.\n\nFirefighters battle a wind-driven wildfire in Sylmar, California, U.S., October 11, 2019.

The upscale suburb lies adjacent to a natural gas storage field where a wellhead rupture caused a massive methane leak in 2015 that forced nearby residents from their homes on and off for months.

The blaze was just 10% contained, Riverside County Fire Department (RCFD) officials said.\n\nThe Sandalwood fire erupted on Thursday afternoon when a garbage truck dumped burning trash that spread onto vegetation, the RCFD and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement.", "description": "A fierce, wind-driven wildfire swept through foothills and canyons along the northern edge of Los Angeles on Friday, engulfing homes, closing roads and devouring acres of dry brush and chaparral as 100,000 residents were forced to flee.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439864130&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0Z8", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
