But their pensions \u2014 providing regular income in retirement \u2014 have become a costly burden for states and their citizens.\n\nMany state pension plans, covering government workers at both the state and local level, are underfunded. There's not enough money to pay all the benefits promised to current and future retirees, and residents might one day have to cough up more tax dollars to cover those costs.\n\nUsing data from the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Foundation for Economic Education, and Governing.com, we've ranked the states, going from those with the healthiest pensions systems to the ones with the biggest pension problems \u2014 potentially for taxpayers.\n\nEditor's note: Governing.com's numbers of state and local government employees per state have been rounded and doubled, since the data excluded education workers. Governing says they account for roughly half of each workforce.\n\nRandy Kostichka / Shutterstock\n\nThe Wisconsin Capitol building.\n\nThe pension program in Wisconsin is **102.6% funded **and has a $2.6 billion surplus.\n\nThere is no pension gap in Wisconsin.
