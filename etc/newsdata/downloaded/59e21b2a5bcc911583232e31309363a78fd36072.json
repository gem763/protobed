Biden is seen as moderate old news, while Warren would be a bolder choice who would also\u2014as the first female president\u2014be an historic one.\n\nFor Trump and the GOP, their rooting interest is more Machiavellian: They look at Warren in roughly the way Ohio State looks at Indiana, or the cheetah looks at the wildebeest\u2014which is to say they see her as the second coming of Hillary Clinton.", "description": "As 2016 proved, opposition parties need to be careful what they wish for.
