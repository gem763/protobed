It\u2019s outlandish.", "language": "en", "text": "This approach, aggressive to the point of outlandish, was on florid display in a federal appeals court in New York this week, as the president\u2019s private lawyer asserted that, yes, Trump could actually shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue with impunity so long as he is president.\n\nThis might sound like a catchy restatement of the generally accepted, although constitutionally untested, wisdom that a sitting president cannot be indicted. But it is actually much worse. Trump lawyer William S. Consovoy was not only asserting that the president is immune from being criminally charged while in office. He was claiming that the president cannot even be investigated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo understand the radical nature of this claim, consider the setting in which it arose. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. is seeking documents \u2014 not testimony, just information, including eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns. He is seeking them not from Trump himself but from his accounting firm. They would be protected from disclosure by grand jury secrecy. Apparently, however, the king\u2019s business can do no wrong either.\n\nSecond, consider the difference between Consovoy\u2019s assertion and the approach taken by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Complying with Justice Department policy, Mueller accepted that Trump couldn\u2019t be indicted. But Mueller explained that it was not only permissible to conduct an investigation while Trump was in office, it was important in order to collect evidence while it was still fresh. Indeed, the very Justice Department memo on which Mueller relied made clear that a \u201cgrand jury could continue to gather evidence throughout the period of [presidential] immunity.\u201d\n\nNow comes Consovoy, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, to claim that the powers of the presidency cannot tolerate Vance\u2019s attempted intrusion. This is an astonishing departure from settled law. In U.S. v. Nixon in 1974, a unanimous Supreme Court upheld a subpoena for tapes of the president\u2019s private conversations while in office, rejecting \u201can absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.\u201d Vance\u2019s subpoena, by contrast, calls only for Trump\u2019s private records; it would not chill his ability to receive candid advice from aides.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1997, again unanimously, the court ruled that another sitting president, Bill Clinton, could be sued for sexual harassment in federal court. Although the decision did not address the question of state lawsuits, it is hard to imagine how a civil lawsuit could be allowed while a grand jury subpoena for his records would go too far. Which is a greater distraction for a sitting president?\n\nThe dangerous audacity of Trump\u2019s position becomes clear: Whatever information his adversaries are seeking, whether in a lawsuit or a congressional inquiry, they can\u2019t have it. And he is making the claim everywhere:\n\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s private lawyers, backed by the Justice Department, have argued that the House Oversight Committee has no right to obtain records from Trump\u2019s accounting firm because its investigation serves \u201cno legitimate legislative purpose\u201d \u2014 that is, the records are not being sought as part of an impeachment inquiry. This month, the federal appeals court in Washington rejected this contention.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 Meanwhile, the Justice Department went to court rather than comply with the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s request for grand-jury materials from the Mueller probe, saying that a federal judge was wrong in 1974 in providing Congress materials from the Watergate grand jury. \u201cWow, okay,\u201d observed Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell. \u201c. . . The department is taking extraordinary positions in this case.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Finally, the White House summarily announced, in a letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), that it would not comply with an impeachment proceeding it termed \u201cconstitutionally invalid and a violation of due process.\u201d Cipollone complained that the House had not voted to authorize an impeachment inquiry \u2014 no matter that the text of the Constitution mandates no such vote.\n\nTo sum up: The king can\u2019t be investigated by law enforcement \u2014 nor can the information that law enforcement has gathered about him be turned over to Congress. He can\u2019t be required to disclose evidence to lawmakers conducting oversight because they aren\u2019t impeaching him \u2014 but he won\u2019t cooperate with an impeachment inquiry unless the processes comply with his dictates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nL\u2019etat c\u2019est Trump. It will be up to the courts, ultimately the Supreme Court, to tell him otherwise.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Attorneys are arguing against precedent for their elected king.", "authors": ["Ruth Marcus", "Overseeing Washington Post Signed Opinion Content", "Writing On Domestic Politics", "Deputy Editorial Page Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fbkZkbZSIdfPA8f4tWH2aq_Ckqw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DJ3JUTHVYAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
