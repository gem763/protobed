Last year's fight, which took place on Manchester, was available to stream through YouTube's pay-per-view service.\n\nRead more: YouTube stars Logan Paul and KSI will fight head-to-head, again, in a boxing match without headgear on November 9 in LA\n\nIt's a surprise decision given how reliant the two online stars are on YouTube, netting millions of subscribers, views, and likely millions of dollars in ad revenue from the video site.\n\nBut KSI's manager, Liam Chivers, took a swipe at YouTube and said the team made the decision to move to DAZN to prevent the match from being pirated.\n\n\"I wasn't going to risk broadcast on an unstable or unsupportive platform and have cost and piracy risk put on KSI,\" Chivers said in a statement emailed to Business Insider.\n\n\"I realized straight after the KSI vs Logan fight that we didn't need to host the rematch on YouTube PPV [pay-per-view]. Not just for the lack of promotional support and high fees, but because people still have to click a link to order the fight regardless of where it is hosted.\"\n\nMore than 860,000 viewers tuned in to watch the match on YouTube's pay-per-view service last year and paid $10 to do so. But even more viewers watched the match through various illegal streams on Twitch.\n\nJason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next and an expert in the industry, vented his frustration about illegal streaming on Twitter last year.\n\n\"Nothing makes sense anymore,\" he wrote. \"I'm ticked off at Amazon [which owns Twitch] for not protecting the live PPV [Pay-Per-View] IP of Google's YouTube from piracy. Welcome to our world, YouTube. Millions in immediately lost value and more importantly undermines future business opportunities as it trains piracy is only a click away. Amazon fail.\"\n\nIt is not clear exactly how much it will cost to watch the fight on DAZN - a membership to stream unlimited sports on its site costs $99.99 a year or $19.99 for a flexible monthly plan. It's also possible that fans will still be able to pirate the match illegally.\n\nAnd it's not clear yet how UK viewers, who are unable to access DAZN, will be able to tune in; Chivers said in his statement that this will be confirmed in \"due course.\"", "description": "The fight will be shown exclusively on sports livestreaming app DAZN.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6f89012e22af1fb22fc595-960-480.jpg"}
