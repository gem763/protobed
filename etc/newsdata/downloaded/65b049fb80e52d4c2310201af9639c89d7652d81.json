Now he\u2019s doubling down.\n\nModi has visited nearly a dozen nations since his landslide re-election win in May, seeking investments from the Middle East, sharing a stage with Donald Trump in Texas and hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping at a seaside resort. He\u2019s also clashed with Malaysia and Turkey over a shock decision to scrap autonomy in India\u2019s lone Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAt home, the Kashmir move is one of several that has worried Muslims, who make up about 15% of the broader population. Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, led by his close associate Amit Shah, has spearheaded changes to Muslim divorce laws and updated a registry that could strip citizenship from nearly 2 million people, including many Muslims.\n\nNext up, Modi and Shah may seek to build a temple in Ayodhya to mark the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram. Their party has championed a decades-long fight to construct the temple on the same site where Hindu groups razed a 16th century mosque in 1992, sparking riots that killed at least 2,000 people -- most of them Muslims.\n\nModi\u2019s assertion of a more muscular foreign policy, combined with moves to placate the Hindu majority, are diverting his base from worries about India\u2019s worst economic slowdown in six years. But his ability to maintain support going forward may hinge on passing tough reforms that unleash growth -- and create jobs -- in Asia\u2019s third-biggest economy.\n\n\u201cModi and Shah can argue that they have a mandate for these actions, given the election victory, and they certainly face little effective opposition in parliament,\u201d said Ian Hall, professor at Australia\u2019s Griffith University and author of the book Modi and the Reinvention of Indian Foreign Policy. \u201cThe crux, however, is whether they can also deliver growth and jobs, and the economic reforms needed to support both.\u201d\n\nThe to-do list is long. The banking system is saddled with bad debt, land is difficult to acquire for public investments and labor laws make it difficult for companies to fire people, pushing the majority of workers into the informal sector. A nationwide goods-and-services tax, or GST, that came into effect in 2017 has failed to deliver expected revenues due to a host of exceptions. And protectionist tendencies have shielded key sectors from foreign competition.\n\nGopal Krishna Agarwal, the BJP\u2019s national spokesman on economic issues, said the party has always been \u201cright of center\u201d and aims to focus on infrastructure, tax compliance and contract enforcement to boost growth. At the same time, he said, it will push for a nationwide citizen registry and uniform civil code -- measures minority groups have resisted in the past.\n\n\u201cWe also believe that nationalism and economic growth aren\u2019t counter to each other,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cWelfare objectives cannot be met without wealth. Economic growth brings in the cake -- only then can it be distributed.\u201d\n\nModi has seen some bright spots. India jumped 14 places to 63rd in the World Bank\u2019s annual rankings for ease of doing business released last week. His government announced a $20 billion corporate tax cut, rolled back a levy on foreign funds, injected $10 billion into sick banks and relaxed foreign direct investment rules in coal mining, contract manufacturing and single-brand retail trading.\n\nLeveraging Power\n\nBut those moves could take time to show results. The central bank this month lowered India\u2019s full-year growth forecast to 6.1%, which would be a seven-year low. The corporate tax cut may further shrink revenues already reeling from the switch to a GST. Bloating federal debt has narrowed the borrowing space for local governments, and the recent stimulus may widen India\u2019s combined fiscal deficit to 7.5% -- the highest in eight years.\n\nIn addition, the federal government has upset some state leaders with initiatives in healthcare, water and sanitation, which are traditionally in the domain of local governments across India\u2019s 29 states. Modi has sought to monitor garbage collection and construction of infrastructure through mobile apps, and his health care system is independent of existing state frameworks.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent much of his first term laying the groundwork to transform India into a nation that is both attractive to global investors and unabashedly Hindu.
