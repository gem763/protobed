The test confirmed that she had the condition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRebecca had never heard of Crohn\u2019s and admits that she thought she just had to take medicine and it would get better.\n\nRebecca Chapman has Crohn\u2019s disease (Picture: Stephen Hawke for Metro.co.uk)\n\nShe explains: \u2018Everyone said it couldn\u2019t be cured but I thought they were wrong. When you\u2019re younger you always think you know better, which I obviously didn\u2019t. I felt a bit confused.\u2019\n\nBut Rebecca soon realised that this is something that would affect her for the rest of her life.\n\nShe has periods where the condition is under control but when she suffers a flare-up, she struggles to eat, is in severe pain and can have bowel movements up to 25 times a day.\n\nShe explains: \u2018On a bad day, I wake up early around 4 am as I need to have a bowel movement. I can\u2019t fall back to sleep because of the pain or side effects from medication keeping me awake.\n\n\u2018I take strong painkillers throughout the day, use hot water bottles to try to help and peppermint tea \u2013 anything to soothe the pain.\n\nRebecca in hospital before her small bowel resection (Picture: Rebecca Chapman/@ChapmanChatter)\n\n\u20188 am rolls around and I have more painkillers and medication. I go back to bed and maybe watch Netflix or play a game on my phone to try and distract me from the pain \u2013 going out of the house or exercising is out of the option as I\u2019m too weak and tired to move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have breakfast as pain after eating is too much to bear. Around noon, I\u2019ll have a nap, which will last until 5/6 pm.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t wake up in between unless I need the toilet as I\u2019m too fatigued. I\u2019ll wake up and have painkillers, medication and toilet trips.\n\n\u2018My joints will ache and I have headaches but I struggle to eat food as it\u2019s too painful.\n\n\u2018At night I\u2019ll try to have a dietary shake that the doctors have given me to keep my calories and nutrition up, or something soft like mash potato or soup \u2013 we don\u2019t want to aggravate the inflammation in the intestines.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll have more painkillers and just sit in bed or on the sofa as moving is too painful and too tiresome. At 10 pm, it\u2019s bedtime \u2013 drugs to make me sleep and more painkillers. Then I will wake up it will start all over again.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I will not go to work for a couple of weeks when having a flare as it would be too much for my body to handle.\u2019\n\nRebecca after her operation (Picture: Rebecca Chapman/@ChapmanChatter)\n\nOn a good day, Rebecca still needs medication and goes to the toilet more often than most people but she can get on with work and day-to-day life.\n\nShe had a small bowel resection surgery four months ago that has helped with her condition and she is currently in remission but another flare could happen at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDealing with the condition has been difficult for her but she says she has an incredible amount of support from friends, family and the online Crohn\u2019s and Colitis community.\n\nShe explains: \u2018I have amazing family and friends which have taken the time to learn about my illness and care for me whilst I\u2019m having a flare-up.\n\nRebecca with a Crohn\u2019s and Colitis UK wristband (Picture: Rebecca Chapham/@ChaphamChatter)\n\n\u2018I also have an amazing team at Southend Hospital. They are always on hand so I can contact them whenever and they will usually get back to me that day.\n\n\u2018Instagram is also a very helpful place for people with Crohn\u2019s and colitis or other autoimmune diseases as so many people blog their journey of illness.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great to connect with others and even get some advice. It helps to talk to people who are in the same situation as you and who understand.\u2019\n\nRebecca also says that working as a yoga teacher has helped her cope with her illness and the frequent pain she experiences.\n\nShe says: \u2018I like to meditate and use breathing techniques to help with the pain and general unwellness that takes over me.\n\nRebecca showing her scar from her small bowel resection surgery (Picture: Rebecca Chapman/@ChapmanChatter)\n\n\u2018Doing these breathing techniques and meditation also breaks up the day and makes me feel like I have done something with the day and accomplished something, which is difficult when you\u2019re housebound from fatigue and pain.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Rebecca says that even when she is at her most unwell because her illness is invisible, most people don\u2019t realise there is anything wrong.\n\nShe says: \u2018I get \u201cyou don\u2019t look sick\u201d loads, especially when I\u2019m having a flare-up. People say: \u201cYou look great you have lost weight\u201d. I say I would rather be heavier than be ill, but people don\u2019t understand, they see it as a great side effect. If they could see me in pain they wouldn\u2019t be saying that.\n\n\u2018People try to sympathise by saying they have had the runs so they know how I feel. All I can say is that it\u2019s not the same. No one understands the pain you go through when your body is sabotaging itself!\n\nRebecca\u2019s condition is currently in remission (Picture: Rebecca Chapman/@ChapmanChatter)\n\n\u2018It not just the toilet trips \u2013 it\u2019s everything else the disease throws at you, as well as extra side effects from medications.\u2019\n\nAlthough Rebecca admits it can be embarrassing to live with Crohn\u2019s, she is determined to speak out about the condition to help people understand more about it.\n\n\u2018People need to grow up and have a mature attitude towards inflammatory bowel disease and the side effects that come with it,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018People who blog or post about the journey are doing a great job, and overall there is much better awareness now than there was when I was diagnosed.\n\n\u2018Crohn\u2019s and Colitis UK do a great job of raising awareness for the illness obviously and putting on their events help.\n\n\u2018The UK is changing and even now there are signs which showcase that not every disability is visible. Things are slowly getting better but it\u2019s so important for people to be knowledgeable about this.\u2019\n\nRebecca posts about life with Crohn\u2019s on her Instagram.\n\nHow to get involved with You Don't Look Sick You Don\u2019t Look Sick is Metro.co.uk\u2019s weekly series that discusses invisible illness and disabilities.
