She [Searle] has failed in her job and should be sacked.'\n\nCritics raised concerns that the relationship between the board and Woodford was too close.\n\nAs well as being chairman of Patient Capital, Searle has sat on the boards of companies Woodford invested in, including start-up investor Mercia Technologies, gene editing firm Horizon Discovery and health company Benchmark Holdings.\n\nCity commentator David Buik, of trading firm Core Spreads, described getting Schroders to run the trust as a 'real coup', but added: 'The board of Patient Capital looked too cosy and incestuous. Searle should have already gone. The buck stops at the top.'\n\nSearle was one of only two board members to survive following the shake-up triggered by the suspension of Woodford's flagship Equity Income fund in June.\n\nInvestors were barred from withdrawing their cash from the fund \u2013 even as the value of their savings tumbled and Woodford continued to charge a total of \u00a365,000 in fees a day.\n\nThe crisis at Equity Income culminated in the collapse of Woodford's investment empire last week. Altmann said: 'It is possible that the board did not ask enough questions and did not put the manager under as much pressure and scrutiny as it would have done had it been a different manager. You have to ask what the board was doing.'\n\nPatient Capital Trust declined to comment.", "description": "The Patient Capital board finally this week appointed blue-blooded City firm Schroders to run the trust - but only after shareholders had lost as much as 75 per cent of their investment.", "authors": ["James Salmon For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
