Some features that stood out to over 5,000 reviewers were the cool-touch exterior, the easy-to-pour spout, and the all-stainless-steel construction, even on the inside, which inspired one customer to call it \u201cthe Holy Grail of electric kettles.\u201d This isn\u2019t that exact kettle, but it is the newest model from Secura, updated for 2019, and this version has all of the same features, including a plastic-free interior. This newer model can also boil a liter and a half of water in just six minutes, has auto shut-off to make sure you don\u2019t boil-dry, and, right now, is on-sale for just $27, 33 percent off the regular list price (and even less than what you\u2019d pay for the older model).\n\nSecura The Original Double Wall Stainless Steel Electric Kettle Water $27 (was $40, now 33% off) $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
