It\u2019s your own good self.\n\nEspecially if that someone special is 65 and older, and living alone, as do around one-third of adults that age\u2014and more than half of those 85 and older.\n\nHolidays can be a challenging time for those living alone. Especially while most of the world sings about sharing, family, and friends\u2014bells jingling all the way.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that a search for \u201choliday depression\u201d brings up a long list of sad stories and shocking statistics.\n\nAren\u2019t the \u201choliday blues\u201d pretty common?\n\nSure, we all feel a little lonely sometimes, and not just on holidays. But for me, it usually passes.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t pass for 40-45 percent of adults who self-reported chronic loneliness in a recent study. This and other sad statistics gave the medical community a belated wakeup call.\n\nWe now call chronic loneliness an \u201cepidemic\u201d and a \u201cglobal public health problem.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s the shocker: chronic loneliness is more likely to cause early death than diabetes.\n\nHow can loneliness threaten our health?\n\nJust as you can starve from lack of food, you can starve from lack of human contact, especially direct touch, like hugs. Think of contact as a vital nutrient, just like food.\n\nWe\u2019re social creatures. Can you think of a single animal that spends its life alone?\n\nHere\u2019s what happens when we\u2019re starved for contact.\n\nIncreased vascular resistance, which can lead to high blood pressure\n\nIncreased production of cortisol, the \u201dstress hormone,\u201d linked to a weakened immune system and uncontrolled blood sugar\n\nIncreased alertness\u2014OK in our hunter-gatherer days, when a lone human was easy prey. Today, it\u2019s empty, sleepless nights\n\nIncreased likelihood of stress, anxiety, and depression\n\nIncreased likelihood of functional and cognitive decline\n\nReduced production of oxytocin, known as the \u201ccuddle hormone,\u201d that\u2019s associated with pleasurable social bonding\n\nIn short, like depression, which we once considered a sad psychological condition, loneliness is now on the list of worst medical outcomes.\n\nHow can I help those I care about?\n\nI just mentioned oxytocin, the \u201ccuddle hormone.\u201d Here\u2019s more on why it\u2019s an anti-loneliness superstar.\n\nOxytocin\u2019s main job in life is to reward us with pleasurable feelings when we have social interactions. And the premier social interaction here is touch.\n\nIt\u2019s as clear as can be. A good dose of oxytocin helps a new mother bond with her baby, relaxes vascular resistance, helps calm blood pressure and inflammation, and more.\n\nSo, hugs and cuddles? An arm around a shoulder, a pat on the back? Hand-holding? They all simultaneously boost production of oxytocin and reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol in our systems.\n\nThey can\u2019t be beat\u2014the more the better, and you can\u2019t overdose.\n\nSo just showing up and hugging someone helps?\n\nYes. It\u2019s the gift that never stops giving. And if you want to enlarge that gift, bring more people. And get your huggable special someone out into the hallelujah, jingle bells world. Watch how his or her face lights up in delight as the holiday colors and sounds fill the air.\n\nThere is no better medicine than hugs and social interaction\u2014especially during challenging times.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to find a place where other lonely people gather\u2014places of worship, community organizations, condo clubs, apartment building open houses, where music, festive good cheer, and caring people will open their doors\u2014and their arms\u2014to you and your special someone. Take advantage!\n\nWhat if I\u2019m the lonely one?\n\nIf you\u2019re likely to feel the holiday blues, there\u2019s a lot you can do to turn those blues into seasonal cheer.\n\nIt\u2019s all in your mindset\u2014the deeply seated way you feel about your life and your world. If your experiences tell you the world is full of bad breaks or dangers, what\u2019s your natural response?\n\nIt\u2019s to stay out of that world\u2014social isolation and chronic loneliness follow.\n\nBut what if you\u2019re older, and you\u2019ve lost friends and family\u2026or they\u2019re far away, or unable to travel?\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nFinding holiday cheer, and joining into the spirit of the season, can all seem too difficult, even impossible.\n\nSo, what can you do?\n\nHow metacognition can prevent loneliness\n\nWe have an extraordinary ability called metacognition, which lets us think about what we\u2019re thinking. And importantly, to deliberately change those thoughts when they interfere with our well-being.\n\nIf you find yourself thinking negative thoughts, you can tell yourself to stop thinking those thoughts and replace them with positive ones.\n\nWhen you replace old, negative thoughts with new, positive ones, your feelings will follow.\n\nWhat\u2019s amazing is that we can actually observe this process working in the brain.\n\nEvery thought \u201cresides\u201d in an observable neural pathway in the brain. The more often the thought occurs, the stronger the pathway, and vice versa.\n\nBrain scans confirm that repeating a new thought over time can make it your default emotional go-to, leaving the old thought to languish and disappear.\n\nWouldn\u2019t that be a wonderful gift for the season, and for life?\n\nHere\u2019s a way to help you create those new thoughts.\n\nCount your blessings, one by one.\n\nI know how challenging ageing can be. But think about this\u2014if you\u2019ve made it this far, you\u2019ve had help every step of the way. And thinking back on all of the people who have provided that help can be tremendously gratifying.\n\nMany people have found that a \u201cgratitude journal\u201d is a great help. It\u2019s as simple as just writing down every person\u2019s name, and the help they gave you.\n\nOr simply write down three things, every day before bed (or upon waking up) that you\u2019re thankful for in general.\n\nYou\u2019ll soon see that you have much to be grateful for.\n\nAnd guess what else?\n\nHow to be your own \u201chormone therapist\u201d\n\nThose good thoughts and memories can kick off production of our favorite happy hormone, oxytocin. So you can create your own \u201chormone therapy.\u201d\n\nConsider this remarkable neurological wonder\u2014a smile releases oxytocin\u2014even when it\u2019s not a real smile.\n\nYes, your brain treats a forced smile as if it were real.\n\nTry it now. Force your face into its biggest smile, the kind that makes you squint, and I\u2019ll bet a genuine smile will follow.\n\nThat\u2019s good medicine. Make it a habit.\n\nBut remember that the best medicine is social contact, including physical touch, so please seek it out. And if you\u2019re hesitant or reluctant to take action, give yourself a push. Social contact will be the best gift you can give yourself, or give others, during the season of giving.\n\nHappy holidays!\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
