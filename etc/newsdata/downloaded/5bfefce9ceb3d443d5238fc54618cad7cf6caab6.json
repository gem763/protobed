We can learn from Trudeau\u2019s \u2018brownface\u2019 moment.", "language": "en", "text": "Let\u2019s dispense with the obvious: Yes, it was a stupid thing to do, as much in 2001 as now. No, he\u2019s not a racist. Yes, he\u2019s done incredible things for pluralism at home and abroad. He\u2019s apologized honestly and acknowledged how his own privilege blinded him to the impact of his actions on others. No, we don\u2019t need to demand more penance from him. Yes, he should have come to this self-awareness much earlier, particularly as a then-29-year-old teacher who also happened to be the son of a former prime minister. No, he shouldn\u2019t resign over this; he deserves to be judged on the totality of his record and whether Canadians believe in his ability to do good in the future.\n\nBut this tawdry incident highlights a much more important conversation all Canadians \u2014 and citizens of all liberal democracies \u2014 need to have.\n\nFirst, some context.\n\nJustin Trudeau and I are the same age. He was born when his father, Pierre Trudeau, was prime minister, growing up at 24 Sussex Drive, Canada\u2019s version of the White House. I was born six weeks later; my father and pregnant mother having recently immigrated to Canada not long after Trudeau p\u00e8re announced, in a statement to our House of Commons, that multiculturalism would be Canada\u2019s official policy.\n\nJustin\u2019s and my upbringing were quite different, but we both grew up in a Canada that defined itself by opportunity: a place where a poor, first-generation kid could get a great public education, work hard and do well in his career, supported by a community with a stake in his success. Like the son of a well-to-do prime minister, he can even be elected to public office.\n\nSorry, Republicans. You can\u2019t call out Northam for racism and give Trump a pass.\n\nWhen I was elected as Calgary\u2019s mayor in 2010, I suddenly became well known beyond the boundaries of my beloved hometown. It surprised me. I thought people might want to talk about my come-from-behind win, or how a wonky professor with little name recognition beat better-known opponents. But all anyone wanted to talk about was my faith: How did a conservative municipality known for cowboys, rodeos and hosting the 1988 Winter Olympics end up with the first Muslim mayor of a major Western city?\n\nI was surprised. My faith was not an election issue. It rarely came up, and when it did, citizens protested. He grew up here, he\u2019s one of us, they said on call-in shows. We don\u2019t care that he fasts during Ramadan, we care what he thinks about public transportation.\n\nI could have waved those questions away, but I felt there was an important story to tell. A story of Canada as a multicultural utopia, as a place that has long understood that everyone who shares this land deserves dignity and the chance to be the best they can be. I still believe that.\n\nEven in Canada, people of colour (or color, if you prefer) don\u2019t quite live in the same world as others. We sometimes have to work a little harder, we have to prove ourselves a little bit more, we have to put up with occasional irritations. But it\u2019s part of the deal to live and have great lives here. And we\u2019ve got jokes to help us sort awkward moments: Go back to my camel, you say? I don\u2019t have one. It\u2019s 2019! I use a camel-sharing app!\n\nI guarantee you there were people at parties in Calgary and in your town this past Halloween who darkened their faces for costume. Heck, I\u2019ve even seen pictures of people dressed as me (despite my annual public service announcement that \u201cSexy Mayor\u201d is not an appropriate look). The folks dressed like me are generally fans. They\u2019re certainly not racists. And \u201cbrownface\u201d (Is that even a thing?) doesn\u2019t have the moral weight and historical baggage of blackface. Does it?\n\nSomeone who is seen as an ally can still do senseless things, however. Even in my amazing country, we don\u2019t always know who really gets it, and who, despite their best intentions, still isn\u2019t quite there. And in the past half-decade, something has shifted. Here in Canada, the home of the Global Centre for Pluralism, a nation where our innovation and defense ministers both wear turbans, where another minister is a refugee from Afghanistan, and where, during the Syrian refugee crisis, political parties supported taking in more people, something isn\u2019t quite right.\n\nIt\u2019s become easier to be careless with our language and comments, both online and in line at the coffee shop. In the run-up to the 2015 federal election, the incumbent government flirted with haters by pledging to ban face veils at citizenship ceremonies and promising to institute a Barbaric Cultural Practices snitch hotline. Canadians, in their way, responded by reporting, My neighbor wears socks with sandals! I saw someone eat Thai food with chopsticks instead of the correct spoon and fork! That government was defeated.\n\nYet in this year\u2019s election, we have a (hopefully marginal) political party vowing, \u201cSay NO to Mass Immigration\u201d and accusing politicians of promoting sharia law. (Neither of these things exist in Canada.)\n\nFar more egregiously, it\u2019s no longer just slogans or casual individual acts of racism. It\u2019s moved into actual policy. In Quebec, a new law prohibits people who wear conspicuous religious attire from holding certain public-sector jobs, including teachers and police officers.\n\nJagmeet Singh, a lawyer, is running for prime minister as leader of a national party, but because he wears a turban, could not serve as a judge in Quebec. I, as a Muslim man, could hold any job I want, but under this law, a Muslim woman who covers with a headscarf cannot. Muslim men who wear long beards could claim it\u2019s just a nod to hipster-dom, and be free and clear, but Orthodox Jewish men with the same beard or a yarmulke cannot. Montreal\u2019s mayor can hold any role, but the leader of her opposition, who wears a kippah, cannot. They\u2019ve stood together against the law.\n\nHere\u2019s what my Yale students get: Free expression and anti-racism aren\u2019t mutually exclusive\n\nIt\u2019s all flagrantly unconstitutional, but the province of Quebec used the \u201cnotwithstanding clause,\u201d a constitutional override provision (ironically, like multiculturalism, a gift from the tenure of the first Prime Minster Trudeau) to protect itself from legal challenge.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny about all of this is that various national leaders have mumbled platitudes about how much they dislike this law, but also haven\u2019t committed to doing anything about it \u2014 including the candidate who wears a turban. Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer leans on the notion of \u201cprovincial jurisdiction\u201d in a way that echoes of the language of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d in the United States.\n\nEven though the federal government could restrict Quebec\u2019s financing or use its legal power to enjoin the provincial legislation, our federal leaders so far haven\u2019t demonstrated the courage to do so. They\u2019re hardly even talking about it. The law is popular in Quebec, and among others in the country, too. In an election year, they must be thinking, why risk losing those votes?\n\nI\u2018m grateful every day that I\u2019m Canadian \u2014 that my parents chose this country on the other side of the world. There\u2019s no better place to have these conversations. But we have to have them.\n\nWe cannot stand on moral high ground calling out leaders for offensive things they did, years ago, if we\u2019re not also willing to stand up against the racist and discriminatory behavior that\u2019s right in front of our faces in 2019. We cannot choose our values a la carte when they benefit us \u2014 we need to be all in, all the time.\n\nCanada, like any other country, isn\u2019t black and white. It\u2019s many-hued. Sometimes, it\u2019s brown. We\u2019re a welcoming, diverse country, but we recognize that we have work to do. Now, let\u2019s use Justin Trudeau\u2019s old blunders to think about the links between individual action and real justice.", "description": "We can't just stand up for our values when it's convenient \u2014 we need to be all in, all the time.", "authors": ["Naheed Nenshi", "Naheed Nenshi Is The Mayor Of Calgary."], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L4SK7OW3EMI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
