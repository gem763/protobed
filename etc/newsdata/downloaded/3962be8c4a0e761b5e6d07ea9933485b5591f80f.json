He\u2019s not human that he\u2019s playing the way he\u2019s still playing. He\u2019s mentally prepared every single game, decisive decisions. He knows how to manage a game. He plays offense and defense with the way that he plays.\n\nPHILADELPHIA EAGLES' FLETCHER COX GRABS SHOTGUN TO DEFEND HOME FROM GIRLFRIEND'S EX: REPORT\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very smart. He\u2019s the best to ever do it. I don\u2019t think anybody can really argue it. He\u2019s just the greatest, and I definitely want some of the water that he\u2019s drinking. Hopefully ... that\u2019s what everyone ... I know for me as well, we all are inspired to be like.\u201d\n\nBeckham said he\u2019s been a big fan of Brady, Bill Belichick and the Patriots for quite some time.\n\n\u201cThey have a system,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, it reminds me of Alabama in a sense that they have a system. They have fast linebackers coming off the edge, good corners and they just play as a team.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEver since I could remember, I\u2019ve been watching Tom Brady. He\u2019s one of my biggest idols. Someone I look up to who has inspired me throughout my life. And it\u2019s just been this way for as long as I can remember ... It\u2019s been the team that everybody has their eyes on because they\u2019re the best and Belichick has just done a phenomenal job over there in running it and getting the team exactly how he wants them, so you\u2019re going to have to bring your A-plus game. \u2026 You can\u2019t beat them by making mistakes. They don\u2019t make many mistakes. They have few penalties. They play perfect.\u201d\n\nWhile Beckham praised Brady, he won\u2019t have him throwing footballs around for the Browns come Sunday.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe former New York Giants receiver is still trying to find common ground with second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield.
