He\u2019s accompanied by two more hitmen under his command, their weapons stashed beneath the seats. At major intersections the driver parks in the shadows between streetlights, and the men recon the town square on foot. The invaders call themselves the Ardillos (squirrels), and they\u2019ve already murdered many of Chimino\u2019s band. His orders from the boss: to attack on sight.\n\nThe team completes its sweep of the streets around the park, then settles on a corner outside a 24-hour convenience store. From the new vantage point the squad commands an unobstructed view of the whole downtown, and Chimino can keep an eye on what\u2019s happening while he talks to this interviewer\u2014whom the enforcer insists on referring to as pinche g\u00fcero, or \u201cfucking white boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see too many g\u00fceros around here,\u201d Chimino says, as I fumble for my notebook. \u201cI hope nobody cuts your head off by accident.\u201d\n\nFinding Chimino wasn\u2019t easy. Interviews between journalists and cartel sicarios (hitmen) aren\u2019t all that rare, but most of the time they take place in the relative safety of a Mexican prison, after the killer has been incarcerated for his crimes.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last several days wandering the bleak streets of Chilapa, pestering priests, aid workers, and store owners in the hopes of landing a face-to-face meeting with a foot soldier for the infamous Los Rojos cartel. Finally I catch a break, when a cabbie tells me about a fellow taxi driver who works as a scout under a man named Chimino who, I am told, is a sicario loco.\n\nThe cabbie offers to set up a rendezvous for later that night, although he makes it clear he won\u2019t be responsible for my safety. When I phone a Mexican journalist, to ask for advice, I\u2019m warned, \u201cLos Rojos se maten por deporte\u201d\u2014\u201cRojos kill for sport.\u201d\n\nThe narco slugfest over Chilapa makes for a slowly growing wasteland of shuttered shops and crumbling homes. During the day, newly widowed mothers tote starving infants about in their shawls, begging table to table in the town\u2019s few remaining caf\u00e9s. It\u2019s unsafe to travel the roads after sundown, and public places don\u2019t stay open past 10 at night. So, I have to meet Chimino on his own terms.\n\nBut the hitman\u2019s story seems worth the risk. Chilapa happens to be a vital crossroads shipping center at the base of the Sierra Madre del Sur. Whichever faction holds the town also controls the exit routes for both raw opium gum and processed heroin coming down from the mountains. Since a single kilo of gum can fetch as much as 15,000 pesos ($975 U.S.) on the black market in Mexico, and a kilo of heroin as much as 40,000 pesos ($2,600), the struggle for Chilapa is as lucrative as it is bloody.\n\nIn the last year-and-a-half, scores of local residents were shot, decapitated, stabbed to death, or burned alive. The cartel warfare in these foothills has led to a murder rate of 54 per 100,000\u2014four times higher than Mexico\u2019s average\u2014making Chilapa pound-for-pound one of the most dangerous places in the country.\n\nAside from a brief prison term in a penitentiary, Chimino has lived his whole life in the embattled Mexican state of Guerrero, and at 25 he\u2019s already a well-known figure in the regional underworld. He started out six years ago as a halc\u00f3n (scout), and slowly worked his way up to the official rank of sicario for the Rojos. Now he\u2019s a top lieutenant under the cartel\u2019s notorious crime lord Zen\u00e9n Nava S\u00e1nchez (aka El Chaparro).\n\n\u201cEl Chaparro always worries about strangers in his territory,\u201d Chimino tells me, and adds that paid informants were watching me since I arrived in town. His jefe is also backed by formidable firepower. According to Chimino, Chilapa is the home base for 70 sicarios who carry AK47, M16s, automatic shotguns, and high-powered pistols.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re everywhere at once,\u201d he says, \u201cbut nowhere to be found.\u201d\n\nChimino has a spikey haircut and a raised, finger-length scar under his left eye. There are more fresh scars on both forearms. He\u2019s on the short side but heavily muscled through the chest and shoulders. With just the start of a paunch, he looks like a welterweight boxer who\u2019s let himself go between bouts. He\u2019s dressed tonight in the popular \u201cnarco polo\u201d style: well-worn but expensive jeans, a printed sports shirt, and the black, outer-stitched shoes called apaches. Just standing still he gives off a powerful, menacing energy, as if even he\u2019s not sure what he might do next.\n\n\u201cTell me what it is you want to know, white boy,\u201d says Chimino (who requested that only his cartel code name be used, to protect his identity).\n\nI ask about the conflict between his syndicate and the Ardillos, an upstart group challenging the Rojos\u2019 dominance of the drug trade, and he answers in rapid, slang-laced Spanish:\n\n\u201cThe Ardillos whores attack us, because they want the town for themselves,\u201d Chimino says. \u201cThey\u2019re also out for revenge because we\u2019ve \u2018disappeared\u2019 so many of their people. But the pricks do the same thing to us. So it\u2019s all fair the way I see it.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask how many people he\u2019s killed for the cartel, Chimino says there have been so many he no longer recalls the exact number. I ask him to estimate, and he says it\u2019s \u201cat least several dozen.\u201d Then he pats me on the shoulder. \u201cYou want to be next?\u201d\n\nA Sinoloa-based network called the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) established the Rojos as a regional enforcement wing in the late 2000s. Upon arriving in Chilapa the cartel took control of the valuable opium trade in the sierra, putting taxi drivers on the payroll as scouts, policemen as accomplices, and even funding election campaigns for politicians.\n\nBut in the last few years, competition and federal prosecution weakened the BLO, and its leaders were either gunned down or arrested\u2014opening the way to intensified turf battles. By the end of 2013, another BLO splinter cell, the Ardillos, was strong enough to threaten the Rojos\u2019 hold over the narcotics production centers around Chilapa. The factions have been going head to head ever since, with neutral bystanders often caught in the crossfire.\n\n\u201cThe Ardillos kill our men, but they also go after civilians,\u201d Chimino says, when I ask him how the two factions differ. \u201cThe bastards even target women. They killed a girl, a waitress who was a spy for us. Those assholes tortured her for information and then they shot her. We can\u2019t forgive something like that.\u201d\n\nFor their part, the Ardillos claim Chimino\u2019s outfit has murdered more than 30 of their members so far in 2015. But they\u2019ve struck back hard in recent months, bolstered in part by powerful political connections\u2014in fact, the Ardillos chief\u2019s brother is president of the state Congress. A mayoral candidate with alleged ties to the Rojos was assassinated by rival gangsters in broad daylight after an election speech on May 2. But that was just foreshadowing for what came next.\n\nFrom May 9-14, Chilapa was the scene of a cartel battle royal, as some 300 Ardillo-backed gunmen occupied the town, disarmed the municipal police, and proceeded to hunt down their competitors\u2014or anyone else who got in their way. Dozens of innocent townsfolk went missing during the raid, including students and human-rights workers. Bodies have been turning up in the hills around town ever since.\n\nOfficial estimates for the number of victims killed or abducted during five days of gang rule range from 16 to 30. But the Morelos Center, a human-rights NGO based in Chilapa, says the actual count could be much higher, with many families too fearful to report missing loved ones after receiving death threats.\n\nBecause police officers willingly surrendered to the Ardillos at the beginning of the occupation\u2014and military units subsequently failed to intervene\u2014the case has drawn comparisons to the mass kidnapping of 43 students last September in the nearby community of Iguala.\n\n\u201cIt was like a goddamned invasion,\u201d Chimino tells me, as he leans against the scout taxi parked at the curb. \u201cThe Ardillos hired a bunch of vigilantes to fight for them, so they outnumbered us. They captured some of our boys, and beat others real bad.\u201d He calls over one of his men to show me the wounds on his face and scalp.\n\nChimino believes all of the missing to be \u201clong dead by now\u201d\u2014whether they were affiliated with the Rojos or not. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pay [the Ardillos] back.\u201d\n\nAt that point, another squad of Rojos passes by the street-corner observation post, whispering briefly with Chimino before moving on. Later, a truckload of Mexican soldiers zooms past us, their M4s at the ready. Chimino\u2019s men don\u2019t even flinch.\n\nChimino seems eager, almost proud, to talk about his work as an assassin for the cartel\u2014like the lonely enthusiast of some arcane hobby who\u2019s finally found an audience.\n\n\u201cI like to wait until a fool is alone, and then take him by surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll throw the pig down by the hair without compassion and put my foot in his back and a knife at his throat.\u201d He slices the air with his hands as he talks.\n\n\u201cThen I knock his head with a pistol butt, hard enough to stun him, and we put him in the back of el vehiculo.\u201d Chimino whacks the death cab\u2019s trunk.\n\nAnd then what happens?\n\nChimino: \u201cSo we take him someplace else\u2014someplace he won\u2019t want to be\u2014to interrogate him. And if he doesn\u2019t answer, and we don\u2019t have orders to hold him [for ransom]\u2014then it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nYou mean you kill him?\n\nChimino: Well, we start to do it slowly. Asking him questions all the time. And if he doesn\u2019t answer\u2014first we cut off a finger. Then another and another. Then his hands. His ears. His feet. Even his balls. And then, if he\u2019s lucky, we shoot him.\n\nDo they ever die from blood loss?\n\nChimino: That\u2019s a good question, white boy. But no. Because we tie them up, at the pressure points, so they don\u2019t bleed out too soon.\n\nSo what if they do talk? Can\u2019t you let them go?\n\nChimino: No. When we snatch someone from [a rival cartel], it\u2019s a sure thing we\u2019re going to kill him. Sometimes the son of a whore will talk right away to get himself off the hook. But that\u2019s not how it works. If we let them live, they can identify us.\n\nWhat about the bodies?\n\nChimino: I like to cut them up into little pieces. Many pieces, so they\u2019re easier to dispose of. Then we dig a grave in the hills, or burn them, or dump them in a river. If you cut them up small enough, it\u2019s easy to make [the bodies] disappear.\n\nAside from your cartel enemies\u2014who else is a potential target?\n\nChimino: Fools like you. Any motherfucker who sticks his nose in our zone. The boss, he pays us by the head.\n\nJust how much do you get paid?\n\nChimino: \u201cIf El Chaparro gives the orders, we get ten thousand pesos ($650) for a job. When the pig is more important\u2014like a cop or a politico \u2014it can pay thirty thousand pesos ($1,950). It all depends on the circumstances. That\u2019s good money, no?\u201d\n\nAnd how do you feel about all of this?\n\nChimino: [Frowning] Such a question. I don\u2019t even know how to answer that one.\n\nLike many other poor young men in Mexico, Chimino first joined a cartel to \u201csupport his family,\u201d including his mother and younger siblings. Before he was a killer for hire, Chimino painted houses\u2014but with so many mouths to feed, he says, he couldn\u2019t make ends meet. Compared to painting, his current occupation provides \u201ca lot more money for a lot less work.\u201d\n\nHe confesses to keeping an altar to Santa Muerta, the Saint of Death, in his house. He also admits to using illicit drugs\u2014including cocaine and crystal meth\u2014which he likes for the \u201ccrazy rush\u201d they give him during confrontations with mob rivals. In spite of the constant violence that surrounds him, Chimino claims he\u2019s not afraid of dying.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t want is to get surprised by anybody out here, and end up getting wounded and sent to prison,\u201d he grimaces. \u201cBetter if the fuckers straight up kill me, if it comes down to it.\u201d When I ask if he has a wife, he shakes his head no. \u201cThat way nobody will miss me, or cry all the time when I die.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019re talking, a Chevy Malibu painted burnt orange, with tinted glass and the decal of a bucking bronco on the rear windshield, rumbles up to the corner. Someone in the backseat waves at Chimino, and he trots over to the tricked-out car.\n\n\u201cThose are my comrades in arms,\u201d he tells me, when he comes back. \u201cThey\u2019re wondering what the hell I\u2019m doing here with you. They\u2019re thinking: Should we all get together and fuck up the white boy?\u201d The orange Malibu eases back into traffic, and Chimino watches until it\u2019s gone.\n\n\u201cSomos muy evidentes aqui,\u201d the hitman says. \u201cWe\u2019re very obvious out here.\u201d\n\nI say I don\u2019t want to put him in any danger.\n\n\u201cThe one who\u2019s in danger\u2014is you,\u201d he says.\n\nA few days later the DEA-backed Federal Police Commissioner will arrive from Mexico City, to meet with the families of the missing in Chilapas. The Commissioner\u2019s press conference won\u2019t last six minutes, and he\u2019ll ignore all questions about the Ardillos\u2019 political connections, or why police officers gave up their weapons to the gang.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the Commissioner hightails it out of town, search dogs will discover a pair of dismembered corpses in yet another common grave near Chilapa\u2014two more victims of the ongoing gang war between the Rojos and Ardillos.\n\nBack on the corner in front of the convenience store, Chimino signals his men that it\u2019s time to go. \u201cWe should get back out on patrol,\u201d he dismisses me. \u201cAnd you should get your white-boy ass out of here right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like to tell our readers in the States?\u201d This question sounds, even to my own ears, like something only a pinche g\u00fcero would ask, yet it\u2019s all I can think to say.\n\nBut the sicario looks thoughtful.\n\n\u201cThe first time you do it, somebody puts the gun in your hand and says, \u2018Kill him or I\u2019ll kill you. It\u2019s your life or his.\u2019 They make you pull the trigger. And maybe you feel bad. But after the first time\u2014it feels different.\u201d\n\nBefore he slips back into the shadows, I ask Chimino what he means by \u201cdifferent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the first time,\u201d he says, \u201cyou start to like it.\u201d", "description": "In the middle of a drug-gang turf war, a hired killer shares his secrets.", "authors": ["Jeremy Kryt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492179350/articles/2015/07/17/the-mexican-hitman-and-the-white-boy/150714-kryt-mexico-hitman-tease_zuuu1x", "published_at": "2015-07-17"}
