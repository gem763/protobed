She will not be punished.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nLynne Patton, former Trump family aide, speaks at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nSince rising from longtime Trump family aide to her $160,000 post as a federal housing official, Lynne Patton has pushed political boundaries. There was her temporary move into New York public housing. Her surprise cameo at the Michael Cohen hearing. Her invocation of the Trump family name in a failed attempt to get a HUD colleague fired. And her inquiry into starring in a reality-TV show.\n\nOn Wednesday, a government watchdog determined that Patton violated a law barring federal executive branch employees from engaging in political activities using their titles while on duty or in a federal building.\n\nPatton\u2019s offense? A series of Twitter \u201clikes\u201d between December 2017 and April 2018 from her official HUD account.\n\nAmong Patton\u2019s illegally \u201chearted\u201d tweets:\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s endorsement of now-Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis,\n\nthe Republican National Committee chairwoman\u2019s opposition to Democrat Joe Manchin III\u2019s U.S. Senate candidacy,\n\na GOP post favoring Mike Pompeo\u2019s confirmation as secretary of state,\n\nand Kanye West\u2019s photo of his autographed Trump campaign hat.\n\n\u201cLiking tweets that advocate for or against partisan political candidates, originate from a political party, or include pictures of campaign material constitutes political activity for purposes of the Hatch Act,\u201d wrote Erica S. Hamrick, deputy chief of the Hatch Act Unit of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, in a letter to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), the organization that brought the complaints against Patton.\n\nIn addition, the Office of Special Counsel determined that Patton violated the Hatch Act when she posed in her HUD office for a photo that accompanied a New York magazine article about her new role. In the photo, Patton was seated with her hands clasped atop her desk. Perched on a bookcase above her head was a red USA hat that turned out to be an \u201cofficial USA 45th presidential hat\u201d sold on the Trump/Pence campaign website.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office found that neither Patton nor the HUD ethics counsel realized the campaign was selling the hat until after the allegations came to light. Patton has removed the hat from her office.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office concluded that while Patton violated the law by \u201cunwittingly displaying a campaign hat in her office and \u2018liking\u2019 partisan political tweets on her official Twitter account,\u201d it would not pursue any disciplinary action.\n\nPatton, in a statement to The Washington Post, noted that the special counsel\u2019s office cleared her in two other allegations made by CREW \u2014 that her appearance at the Cohen hearing and a tweet defending HUD Secretary Ben Carson also violated the Hatch Act.\n\n\u201cI am grateful that the Office of Special Counsel remains an unbiased voice in Washington, D.C., that examines accusations based upon their merits instead of their number of retweets,\u201d Patton said.\n\nCREW had flagged a retweet from Patton\u2019s official and personal accounts of a message supporting Carson. Along with the retweet, Patton had written, in part, \u201cIt may be a Hatch Act violation. It may not be. Either way, I honestly don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office found the retweet did not violate the law because Carson is not a candidate for political office. \u201cAnd your own message, while seemingly dismissive of the Hatch Act, was not directed at the success or failure of a candidate or political party,\u201d Hamrick wrote in a letter to Patton.\n\nAs for Patton\u2019s silent appearance at the House Oversight Committee hearing during Cohen\u2019s testimony in February, the special counsel\u2019s office determined that Patton had taken an unpaid day off and appeared at the hearing in her personal capacity.\n\nHamrick warned Patton that any further prohibited political activity could result in discipline.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, executive director of CREW, noted that Patton is the 13th Trump official to be reprimanded for a Hatch Act violation. The Office of Special Counsel in June recommended that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway be removed from federal office for repeatedly violating the Hatch Act by \u201cdisparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media.\u201d Trump refused to fire Conway.\n\n\u201cAfter years of serving Donald Trump\u2019s interests, it appears that Lynne Patton is still doing so in her taxpayer-funded job,\u201d Bookbinder said in a statement. \u201cIn a democracy, laws preventing the government from acting to keep itself in power are crucial, and we will work tirelessly to see that they are enforced.\u201d", "description": "The special counsel\u2019s office concluded that while Patton violated the law by \u201cunwittingly displaying a campaign hat in her office and \u2018liking\u2019 partisan political tweets on her official Twitter account,\u201d it would not pursue any disciplinary action.", "authors": ["Tracy Jan", "Reporter Covering The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy", "September At Pm", "Tracy Jan Covers The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy For The Washington Post.
