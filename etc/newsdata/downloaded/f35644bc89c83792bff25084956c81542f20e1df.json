Our country has ensured both its own security and Syria's territorial integrity.\n\n'And the agreement we reached with the U.S. last Thursday is just a reflection on the diplomacy table of our success in the field.\n\n'Operation Peace Spring has shown the entire world Turkey's soft and hard power, operational capability and military abilities.'\n\nThe Kurdish fighters are dominated by the YPG, a militia which Turkey regards as a terrorist group.\n\nAmerican withdrawal: U.S. military vehicles drive on a road in the town of Tal Tamr in northern Syria on Sunday after pulling out of their base\n\nProtesters blocked the path of US military convoys leaving the region on Sunday, begging them to stay.
