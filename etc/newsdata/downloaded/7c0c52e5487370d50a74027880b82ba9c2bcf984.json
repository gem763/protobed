Some investors have been initially tepid about the deal to create a new tobacco titan, that said the question for cannabis stakeholders is whether this massive transaction is in fact about tobacco.\n\nThe Background\n\nAltria and PMI have both invested in researching reduced-risk products (RRPs), including e-cigarettes and PMI\u2019s IQOS products, to offset declining sales in the traditional smokable tobacco space.\n\nIn December 2018, Virginia-based Altria Group agreed to invest $2.4 billion CAD ($1.8 billion USD) in Cronos Group, an Ontario-based cannabis producer Cronos Group. The investment was deemed by some analysts as \u201chighly speculative\u201d since Cronos\u2019 2018 revenues were $15.7 million. When the deal closed in March, it gave Altria \u2013 one of North America\u2019s largest tobacco companies, with a 10% equity stake in international alcohol giant Anheuser-Busch InBev \u2013 a 45% ownership interest (with a $1.4 billion CAD option for a 55% stake) in Cronos. Altria also controls a majority of the Canadian company\u2019s board. For its own venture into the cannabis space, Anheuser-Busch InBev invested $50 million in a partnership with Tilray to research THC-and CBD-infused beverages.\n\nLast year, Altria paid $12.8 billion for a 35% share of Juul Labs, manufacturer of popular but controversial high-nicotine vaporizers. The brand represents roughly 48% of the e-cigarette market in the U.S, though it has also seen recent challenges. A merger could potentially expose PMI to regulatory risks from Juul, whose CEO Kevin Burns on Thursday took the unusual step of appearing on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d to warn nonsmokers against his company\u2019s product. In July, Juul executives were called to Capitol Hill to address their role in \u201cthe youth nicotine epidemic\u201d. Juul\u2019s problematic public relations troubles, added to PMI\u2019s hefty investment in alternative products, could weaken Altria\u2019s overall market position. Meantime, PMI\u2019s share price fell by 7.8% with news of the merger talks.\n\nPMI has reportedly invested $6 billion since 2008 to develop IQOS, a smoke-free device which heats tobacco, and which in April earned FDA approval to sell in the United States (under an existing licensing deal with Altria). PMI has introduced IQOS in more than 30 markets worldwide \u2013 generating $4 billion in global sales in 2018 \u2013 and projects the product as a growth engine worth up to 40% of its sales come 2025 (up from 14% last year).\n\nJuul and IQOS of course were created in attempts to shore up what the companies have lost through declining cigarette sales as fewer Americans light up, and cigarette sales worldwide have dropped. According to PMI (which does not sell products in the U.S.), its cigarette volumes fell 3.6% in Q2-2019. Altria projected a 5%-6% decline in U.S. cigarette sales for 2019. Meantime, PMI says that in the past two years some 7.3 million people globally have stopped smoking cigarettes by switching to IQOS.\n\nThe Stakes\n\n\u201cThe question obviously has a lot of money riding on it,\u201d notes Patrick Anderson of Michigan-based market consultants Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a corporate partner of New Frontier Data. \u201cThis is a huge deal within the tobacco market as the largest producer of that traditional market. They have a business that is widely seen as having health risk associated, and it is in long-term decline. A company in that situation needs to start selling something different. Cannabis-related products are an obvious extension of a commodity which many see as a substitute.\u201d\n\nThe overall displacement or cannibalization of tobacco by cannabis products in California alone amounted to $84.5 million overall from 2017-2018 (not including 2017 e-cigarettes, figures for which were not available). The shifts amounted to $33.8 million for cigarettes, $8.3 million for non-cigarette tobacco, and $42.6 million for e-cigarettes (in 2018 only).\n\nAcross the U.S. overall, the 2018 spending shifts amounted to $4.3 billion for alcohol: (1.54% of that market), $1.3 billion for pharmaceuticals (1.10%), and $219 million (0.22%) for tobacco.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Last week, Altria Group and Philip Morris International (PMI) announced being in discussions for a potential all-stock \u201cmerger of equals,\u201d signifying a combined $210 billion deal with impacts for one of the Canadian cannabis sector\u2019s leading companies.
