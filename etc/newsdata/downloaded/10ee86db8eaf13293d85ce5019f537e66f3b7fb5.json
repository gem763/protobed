REUTERS/Thomas White\n\nMost moves were modest, though, as caution tempered the mood. The Australian and New Zealand dollars each rose nearly 0.3%. The safe-haven currencies of the Japanese yen and Swiss franc each eased very slightly.\n\n\u201cGlobal risks remain but have shown signs of subsiding,\u201d Philip Wee, FX strategist at Singapore\u2019s DBS Bank said in a note.\n\n\u201cChina-U.S. trade tensions have stopped escalating ... the Fed has reasons to sound less dovish on a \u2018half-full\u2019 narrative for the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump had said a trade agreement looked to be ahead of schedule on Monday, without detailing the timing. The United States also said it was studying whether to extend tariff suspensions due to expire in December.\n\nThat followed remarks late last week from both U.S. and Chinese officials saying they were \u201cclose to finalising\u201d a deal, driving equities and bond yields higher on Monday. The appetite for risk remained on Tuesday.\n\nThe Aussie hit its highest since Wednesday, touching $0.6859, while the greenback held on to its overnight progress against the yen to stand at 108.97 yen per dollar, just below a three-month high.\n\nChina\u2019s central bank lifted its official yuan midpoint to the highest level in over two months on Tuesday, and the currency edged higher to 7.0564 per dollar.\n\nThe dollar was a little softer against the euro at $1.1090 and a little stronger against of currencies at 97.813.\n\nBeyond the trade headlines, the major focus this week is the Fed meeting. The U.S. central bank is expected to cut rates for a third time in a row when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors are watching for any indication that further cuts are likely, with futures pricing suggesting more easing is expected in 2020. If that is not foreshadowed, traders expect the dollar to rise.\n\n\u201cThe forward guidance will be the thing,\u201d said Westpac analyst Imre Speizer in Auckland.\n\n\u201cIt still looks like a done deal that they will cut, but then the risk is that they might characterise that as just one more insurance move ... the market will have to take out the pricing it\u2019s got for future dates.\u201d\n\nThe British pound, meanwhile, nudged lower to $1.2855, with Brexit hanging in the balance.\n\nThe European Union has agreed to delay Britain\u2019s exit for up to three months, but the country is politically paralysed and overnight parliament rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s third attempt to schedule a Dec. 12 election.\n\nJohnson has said he would try again, by a different legislative route that would only require a simple majority, rather than a two-thirds majority.", "description": "Hopes for an easing in Sino-U.S. tensions buoyed trade-exposed Asian currencies on Tuesday, while growing expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve could take a wait-and-see approach to further easing underpinned the dollar.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446014611&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S01C", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
