LEVI, -0.16% taking measures to reduce water use in making their jeans, and retailers like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.01% unveiling plans to go carbon neutral.\n\nRead: Amazon has \u2018ambitious by achievable\u2019 plan to hit Paris climate goals 10 years early and go carbon neutral by 2040\n\nPart of the reason for the growth in the secondhand and resale market is environmental concern, with many shoppers, particularly millennials and Gen Z consumers, taking steps to reduce the waste the comes with fast-fashion and overstuffed closets.\n\nConsumers are also examining their dining habits, with Accenture finding that shoppers plan to spend more on fruit, plant-based foods, or organic and vegan items and less on holiday desserts.\n\nSee: Macy\u2019s, J.C. Penney join growing list of retailers that are tapping the secondhand market\n\nAll of these considerations aren\u2019t expected to drive down holiday spending. Accenture forecasts an average holiday spend of $637 this year, with 57% expecting to spend the same as last year and 28% expecting to spend more.\n\nDeloitte forecasts a 4.5% to 5% total rise in 2019 holiday sales, with the tally expected to exceed $1.1 trillion. E-commerce is expected to reach $144 billion to $149 billion.\n\nAlixPartners is forecasting a 4.4% to 5.3% rise in total sales, though experts say there is \u201cunprecedented uncertainty\u201d about the holiday season, thanks to the trade war between the U.S. and China, worry about a coming recession and other global anxieties.\n\nAccenture also notes that rising food bills and credit card debt will affect holiday season spending, with nearly a third of respondents citing these two factors.\n\nThe SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, -0.73% is down 16.7% for the past year.
