First, most people felt this target would prove a stretch anyway so weren't hanging their hats on the bank hitting the 20 per cent level.\n\n'Second, its excuses for falling short look pretty cast iron and would not be a big surprise to investors.\n\n'Interest rates are no longer expected to go up, and this puts pressure on the amount banks can charge to lend money. While global and domestic economic and political uncertainty remains elevated.'", "description": "Barclays profits plunged in the third quarter after it was hit by another PPI provision of \u00a31.4billion before the final deadline for compensation at the end of August.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
