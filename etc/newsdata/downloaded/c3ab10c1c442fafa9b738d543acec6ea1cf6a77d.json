(Iwan Baan)\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art in New York used to function like holy writ. The things it chose to show were not just examples of modern art and design. They were claims staked, standards set, guiding lights. Together, they sent a clear message to the world about modernism: This was important. This counted. The rest did not.\n\nBecause MoMA had the biggest collection with the best examples of the most important modern artists and designers, the edicts it broadcast had unrivaled authority. MoMA not only had a story to tell, the people telling that story were confident and powerful.\n\nIf this era at MoMA has been drawing to a close for a while, it is now officially over.\n\nClosed to the public throughout this summer and early fall, MoMA is about to reopen after a costly expansion. Ten years in the planning, it comes 15 years after the last addition, which was designed by the Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi.\n\nArchitects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, working with Gensler, have rearranged the museum\u2019s internal structure. On the museum\u2019s west side, they have added a new wing which allows for more than 30,000 square feet of new gallery space. But the extra space, according to the museum\u2019s chief curators, is not really the point.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019re doing is actually almost independent of an expansion,\u201d says Ann Temkin, MoMA\u2019s chief curator of painting and sculpture. \u201cThe way this expansion differs so much from any prior expansion \u2014 and we\u2019ve done plenty \u2014 is that it is simultaneously a physical expansion and an absolute rethink of the curatorial approach.\u201d\n\nThis rethink is also a kind of reversion, according to the museum\u2019s longtime director, Glenn Lowry. It brings the museum back in line with founding director Alfred Barr\u2019s original vision of the museum as a laboratory, a space for experiment.\n\nIn the broadest terms, MoMA wants to step back from the embarrassing business of telling big, confident stories about art and culture. It wants instead, says Temkin, to tell \u201cshort stories\u201d \u2014 propositions that are provisional but fruitfully interconnected.\n\n\u201cThe basic fact,\u201d says Stuart Comer, MoMA\u2019s chief curator of media and performance, \u201cis that I don\u2019t think any of us believes any longer that there is a singular history. There are a lot of different histories, and how you weave those together is an evolution, an ongoing process. So we\u2019re approaching the collection less like a canon and more like a conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we added in 2004 and 1984,\u201d says Temkin, \u201cit was just more room to do exactly what we did, the same way we did it.\u201d This expansion, by contrast, is about rethinking MoMA\u2019s great strength: its permanent collection \u2014 the almost 200,000 works on which it lavishes tens of millions of dollars every year, acquiring, cataloguing, storing, studying and conserving, even though most of it is never displayed.\n\nTapping into this unrivaled resource means embracing a state of continuous flux \u2014 not the easiest thing for an art museum. The collection galleries will be rotated every six to nine months, so that more works will be put on display.\n\nJust as significantly \u2014 and with huge implications for its administration \u2014 the museum has been working hard to integrate curatorial departments that once acted like separate fiefdoms, and at times almost like separate museums.\n\n\n\nVisitors can view Oskar Schlemmer\u2019s \u201cBauhaus Stairway\u201d while walking on the museum\u2019s restored Bauhaus staircase. (Iwan Baan)\n\nRethinking how the staff collaborate has been a challenge, according to Martino Stierli, chief curator of architecture and design. \u201cBefore, each department had its respective galleries. . . . Now, there\u2019s a constant conversation between all the departments. That\u2019s new and it\u2019s different. But it\u2019s also been extremely productive and an enormous learning experience for all of us.\u201d\n\nThe ground floor of the new MoMA will be free. Even those who remain outside can get a taste of MoMA\u2019s art, because a big, street-facing window will allow them to see into a large gallery.\n\nThere will be multiple routes leading from the ticketing desk to the galleries, so that audiences will be able to take different paths through the museum from the outset. The galleries themselves are now less regular in size and height than they were. More windows and openings will offer glimpses into spaces on different levels.\n\nAt the heart of the collection galleries will be a double-height space called the Studio for live performances and programming, so that dance, sound works, film and performance will be at the core of the museum\u2019s display, not cordoned off. A second-floor space, called Platform, will focus on education \u2014 but with a playful, interactive approach.\n\n\u201cThe museum is not the place where we\u2019re going to give a lesson,\u201d says Christophe Cherix, chief curator of drawings and prints. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where you can experiment, understand and make your own opinion. We\u2019re totally committed to scholarship, as we\u2019ve always been. But it\u2019s just a different way to share this collection. It\u2019s not about telling you \u2018this is important, this is less,\u2019 or \u2018that was made because of that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen MoMA reopens, it will feature three temporary exhibitions. One, devoted to Betye Saar, will feature works on paper relating to Saar\u2019s autobiographical sculpture, \u201cBlack Girl\u2019s Window.\u201d Made in 1969, \u201cBlack Girl\u2019s Window\u201d is part of the permanent collection, so the show exemplifies the new approach of blurring the lines between temporary shows and collection displays.\n\nA second show will feature another African American, Pope.L. His sculpture, performance, video, photography and installation art will be the subject of a trio of presentations this fall at MoMA, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Public Art Fund.\n\nThe third \u2014 and by far the biggest \u2014 exhibition will be a display of abstract art in different media by leading Latin American modernists, including Lygia Clark, H\u00e9lio Oiticica and Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto. \u201cSur moderno: journeys of abstraction\u201d will highlight works given to MoMA over many years by Patricia Phelps de Cisneros . Scattered among the Latin American art will be a handful of works from Europe and Russia, including Piet Mondrian\u2019s \u201cBroadway Boogie Woogie.\u201d\n\nTremendous power used to be invested in the individuals heading each curatorial department at MoMA. Those chief curators are now at pains to stress that their displays are a team effort \u2014 the result of contributions by curators from many backgrounds, at all levels, in all departments.\n\n\u201cWe want,\u201d says Cherix, \u201cto show contradictory perspectives.\u201d\n\nSome who remember the old MoMA resent all the changes it has undergone in recent decades. They long for the days when the museum presented its canon of modernist masterpieces (which were also, of course, overwhelmingly by white male artists) in galleries that felt almost like hallowed spaces.\n\nTemkin and her colleagues are expecting complaints. \u201cI enlarged my mailbox for October,\u201d she laughs.\n\n\n\nBetye Saar holds \u201cBlack Girl\u2019s Window\u201d at her studio in Los Angeles in 1970. The work is now in the permanent collection at MoMA. (Bob Nakamura/Courtesy Betye Saar and Robert Projects)\n\nFirst-time visitors make up more than half of the total audience at MoMA. Conscious that many come expecting to see certain masterpieces (for instance, Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cThe Starry Night,\u201d Picasso\u2019s \u201cLes Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon,\u201d Mondrian\u2019s \u201cBroadway Boogie Woogie\u201d or Matisse\u2019s \u201cThe Red Studio\u201d), the chief curators drew up a list of the works that, as Cherix put it, \u201cpeople really want to see if they\u2019ve traveled the world to come to MoMA.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got it down,\u201d says Temkin, \u201cto fewer than we would have thought\u201d \u2014 about 15 works. Those iconic works will stay on display.\n\nBut if everything else is more or less replaceable, says Cherix, \u201cwhy not change everything around? Why not allow people not to think about those works just as postcards? Because when we always show the same works the same way, people don\u2019t feel the need to come back, and those works are not really alive.\u201d\n\nIn the new setup, continues Cherix, \u201cevery work has a chance of finding its way to the galleries. That\u2019s an important change.\u201d\n\nTemkin recognizes the relativity of aesthetic judgment and welcomes the evolution of the limited curatorial viewpoint. She stresses that her idea of what art is best is not the same as her assistant curator\u2019s idea; it\u2019s just her perspective.\n\n\u201cThe polyphony among the curators\u2019 perspectives now is aligned with the polyphony of what we\u2019re thinking about art history,\u201d she says.\n\nPublic reaction to the new MoMA will no doubt combine a bit of polyphony with some cacophony.\n\nThe new Museum of Modern Art opens Oct. 21. 11 W. 53rd St., New York. moma.org.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe most stirring photo from the Apollo mission wasn\u2019t of the moon.
