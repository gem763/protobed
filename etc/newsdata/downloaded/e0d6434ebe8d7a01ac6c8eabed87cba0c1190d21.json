In that game, Scherzer and the Nationals prevailed, 5-4, and the Astros lost a game started by Cole for the first time since July 12.\n\nBut around 4:30 p.m., Nationals Manager Dave Martinez made a stunning announcement: Scherzer would not start because of spasms in his neck and his upper back, near his throwing arm. Joe Ross, a former starter who pitched mostly out of the bullpen this season, would take the mound instead. Ross threw 19 pitches over two strong innings in Game 3 on Friday.\n\nAs a result, the Nationals will have to lean on one of their weaknesses: their bullpen. Scherzer had been receiving treatment but woke up on Sunday \u201creally hurting,\u201d Martinez said. Scherzer is known as one of the most competitive players in baseball \u2014 he pitched with a bloody and broken nose earlier this season \u2014 so his spasms most likely are very serious to force him out of a World Series game.\n\nMartinez said he hoped Scherzer could come back and pitch in relief in Game 6 on Tuesday if the season was on the line. But if there was a Game 7, Martinez said he would turn to Scherzer. Stephen Strasburg is slated to start Game 6.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really upset about it,\u201d Martinez said of Scherzer. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen \u2014 believe me \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen Max this quiet. He\u2019s very quiet.\u201d\n\nBut General Manager Mike Rizzo expressed confidence in Ross. \u201cHe\u2019s got good stuff and he got his feet wet the other night, so that\u2019ll help him, that\u2019ll help the nerves a little bit,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cBut you do an emergency start in Game 5 of the World Series against the Houston Astros, he\u2019ll have to control his emotions and not be amped up and just follow the game plan and see what happens. It could be a good story, man.\u201d", "description": "The Nationals received devastating news hours before first pitch: Max Scherzer will not be able to start on Sunday because of back spasms.
