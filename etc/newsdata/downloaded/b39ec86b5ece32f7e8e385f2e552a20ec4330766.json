We moved ourselves from Nebraska to Ecuador in 2001, and since then, we\u2019ve lived and worked in seven communities in four countries. Along the way, we\u2019ve learned a few things about the basics of preparing for and making a move to another country and culture.\n\nWe call these the \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d of becoming an expat. For the most part, they\u2019re the same no matter where you relocate. Some of the details vary, of course \u2014 visa requirements, currencies, language considerations and other aspects of expat life will change with location and may change over time as well.\n\nBut the basics remain the same. So, here\u2019s a general checklist to help you start putting the pieces in place to begin your own move:\n\nVaccinations\n\nBefore moving abroad it\u2019s wise to be up-to-date with basic vaccinations like MMR (measles/mumps/rubella), DPT (diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus) and polio. Particular destinations can have particular recommendations as well.\n\nFor instance, it may be prudent to vaccinate for hepatitis A&B, typhoid, and yellow fever. You can search the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for recommended vaccinations by destination.\n\nHave a health care plan in place\n\nBefore you leave the U.S., make a decision about your basic health care and insurance strategy.\n\nWill you keep your Medicare coverage? (We usually suggest keeping at least Medicare Part A paid up and active. It\u2019s typically free, and you never know when your circumstances may change.)\n\nOnce you move, what local health care options will you want and need? Will you immediately try to join an available national health care plan, sign up for a hospital-based plan, opt for a private insurance policy or pay for your medical care out of pocket as you go? In many countries, it\u2019s possible to combine any or all of these options.\n\nAlso see: The best cities and countries to retire abroad\n\nBefore you leave, be sure to assemble your personal medical history folder. You\u2019ll want to include a complete medical history, including past treatments, chronic conditions, test results, a list of medications you take and so on. This will help your new medical professional wherever you move and can be invaluable to your expat friends should they need to assist you in case of an accident or sudden illness.\n\nFinances\n\nNow\u2019s the time to take stock of your credit cards, bank accounts and more.\n\nMake sure the cards you use most often don\u2019t charge foreign currency or transaction fees. American Express AXP, +0.99% , Capital One, COF, +0.09% Discover, DFS, +0.59% Chase JPM, +0.00% and Citi CITI, +0.57% are a few that don\u2019t. Make sure to know about all the benefits and drawbacks of each of your cards and know your PINs and passwords, if need be. (Keep in mind that your credit card company will likely require you have a mailing address in your home country.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to keep a bank account at home for paying your credit cards, local bills, taxes and so on.\n\nAlso, make sure you\u2019re familiar with the online bill-paying money-transfer services.\n\nATMs are a great way to access cash when needed and tend to offer the most favorable local currency exchange.\n\nChoosing a local bank\n\nSome people find it useful to have a local bank account in their new home country. Having one can help you qualify for a residence visa, by proving your financial solvency. And some banks conveniently allow you to automatically deduct recurring bills like utilities or rent instead of having to pay in person. It\u2019s best to choose a bank with a branch in your neighborhood for easy access and to establish a personal relationship with the bank manager as soon as possible.\n\nRelated: Retiring abroad: great health care, cheap rent. Here\u2019s the catch\n\nIt\u2019s also wise to choose a bank that has been in business for many years and has a good credit rating. Ask if deposits are insured, and to what amount. You can do an internet search to find feedback \u2014 good or bad \u2014 about the bank. Be sure to ask about fees, minimum deposits and other requirements important to you, such as the availability of debit cards.\n\nThe best advice, of course, will come from other expats. Ask about their experiences and see which banks most recommended.\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. government has launched an initiative to thwart tax evaders hiding assets in overseas accounts \u2014 and the IRS is serious about collecting any money owed. Because of these increased reporting requirements, some international banks will no longer open accounts for U.S. citizens.\n\nA good way to find the best banks in your new community overseas is to ask your fellow expats. Be sure you understand your filing and compliance requirements. You can learn more with a quick online search or at the IRS website.\n\nTypically, to open a foreign account, you\u2019ll need your passport, Social Security number, sometimes a letter of reference, and/or a utility bill indicating your local address. While some banks won\u2019t open a checking account unless you have a residence visa, others may open a savings account with just a passport.\n\nMail, phone, internet and TV\n\nForeign post offices aren\u2019t known for their efficiency and getting mail delivered to your door abroad can be a challenge. We suggest moving online as much of your correspondence, finances and communication as possible.\n\nWhatever strategy you decide to use, implement it before leaving home to make sure it works to your satisfaction.\n\nAs far as phones go, we\u2019ve relied on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services for years now. VoIP services like Skype, magicJack, and Vonage let you make and receive calls for little or no charge wherever you have an internet connection. Even traditional phone companies are now providing plans with inexpensive or free calls to Mexico, Canada and the U.S.\n\nWe, and most expats we know, primarily use WhatsApp for texting and voice calls, both local and international. Take these services for a test run before leaving home to ensure they work well for you.\n\nOnce you get where you\u2019re going, local cell service is usually not costly and easy to get. Either buy a phone locally with a calling plan that includes text and data or bring an unlocked phone with you and buy a local SIM card.\n\nWe doubt you\u2019ll ever be in a place so remote that you won\u2019t be able to get some kind of TV programming. With a reasonably fast internet connection, you\u2019ll have access to online movies and TV services.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How this couple retired to Spain\u2019s gorgeous Andalusia region on about $40,000 a year \u2014 and you can, too\n\nApple Fire TV Stick, Roku, and Netflix NFLX, -2.09% all work abroad, but particularly with Netflix, some content might not be available due to licensing restrictions. If you really need exactly the same TV you have back home, attach the Slingbox device to a cable input back home and use it to stream your programming to wherever you happen to be.\n\nTaxes and legal issues\n\nRemember, moving out of the U.S. does not mean you don\u2019t have to file taxes back home. You may not owe anything, but you do have to file. If your tax situation is at all complicated, we suggest you confer with a tax adviser who understands tax laws and regulations that apply to expats.\n\nIf and when you apply for a residence visa, you will likely need:\n\nA copy of your birth and marriage certificates\n\nPolice records if required by your destination country\n\nFinancial income or pension statements\n\nYou may also want to make sure your will is up-to-date before you move. It\u2019s also a good idea to have a local will in the local language, especially if you have local assets, including real estate.\n\nIn a foreign legal system, your existing will may not be applicable, and in the case of your death, your property will be disposed of according to local custom and procedure. Avoid this with a properly constructed local will. And be sure that if you acquire assets abroad, you add instructions for their disposition in your will in your home country.\n\nTaking your pet along\n\nPaperwork and quarantine requirements for pets vary from country to country, so be sure you know what applies where you\u2019re moving. In most cases, you will need full vaccinations and an International Health Certificate signed within 10 days of departure by a vet. In some countries, and for some breeds, a microchip implant is also required.\n\nContact the nearest consulate of your new country for the latest information. And check with your airline for pet travel information as well.\n\nWhat to take and what to leave home\n\nIt\u2019s your personal preference whether to ship a container of household goods. But keep in mind, your furniture may not be suitable for your new home. Overstuffed La-Z-Boys don\u2019t do well in the tropics, as you might imagine.\n\nWhat you will want to take, though, at least until you find your local equivalents, are any prescription medications you need as well as lotions, potions, or cosmetics you can\u2019t live without. Bring a few months\u2019 supply with you to tide you over.\n\nAlso, bring your personal electronics (iPods, iPads, Kindles, cameras and phones). Thanks to import duties, these items will likely cost more to replace in your destination country than you paid for them back home.", "description": "Here\u2019s a checklist to help you start putting the pieces in place to become an expat.", "authors": ["Suzan Haskins", "Dan Prescher"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR528_na_pre_ZG_20190918104427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
