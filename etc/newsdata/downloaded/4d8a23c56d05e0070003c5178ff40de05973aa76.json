In a motion filed in New York Supreme Court on Thursday, Zervos\u2019 attorney, Mariann Meier Wang, revealed an itinerary that showed that Trump was staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel in December 2017. Emails released by the Trump Organization also show Zervos seeking to set up a meeting with Trump in New York earlier that month.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nZervos alleges that Trump met with her in his office in early December, and kissed her on the mouth twice. She said she was unnerved, but wrote it off as Trump\u2019s way of greeting people. Later that month, she said she went to Trump\u2019s bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. When he arrived, she said he immediately started kissing her and grabbed her breast. She got away from him, but he led her into the bedroom and tried to press himself against her, according to her suit.\n\nTrump denied Zervos\u2019 claim when she first came forward in October 2016, issuing a statement saying that he \u201cnever met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.\u201d\n\nThe new itinerary indicates that Trump stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Dec. 21 and 22. Zervos\u2019 attorney argues that the document proves that she and Trump \u201cwere exactly where she said they were exactly when she said they were there.\u201d\n\nZervos had also alleged that Trump invited her to come to the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes the morning after their meeting at the hotel. His itinerary indicates that he was scheduled to be at the golf course on the morning of Dec. 22.\n\nWang is asking Judge Jennifer Schechter to unseal another nine pages of discovery records, which she says will offer even greater corroboration of Zervos\u2019 allegation.\n\nTrump has been ordered to sit for a deposition in the case by Dec. 6. Motions for summary judgment in the case are due on March 31, 2020.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
