Could", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cMy kids are at a point now where if they see me walk through the door with an orange suit on and a wig they\u2019re like \u2018Hey, Dad,\u2019\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to them.\u201d\n\nBy the time Adams decided to retire from the N.F.L., in March 2013, he had found the perfect vehicle for his personality \u2014 and forum for his announcement. In a video posted to (what else?) his YouTube account, Adams shows up at the \u201critzy\u201d location his agent has booked for his news conference, a White Castle restaurant, where he gives his speech to an empty room. At the end of the clip, Adams begins filling out a White Castle job application.\n\nThe video went viral.\n\n\u201cI pressed Enter on a keyboard to upload it on YouTube,\u201d Adams said. \u201cAnd then next thing I know, ESPN assignment desk was emailing me like, \u2018Hey, can we put this up?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, sure.\u2019 And then, by the time I walked in the living room, Trey Wingo was talking about it on ESPN.\u201d\n\nWith his playing career over, Adams began working with a talent manager, Eddie Pietrucha, who had a track record of guiding athletes into traditional broadcast media. Adams got a spot as a commentator on a Chicago cable talk show, \u201cInside the Bears,\u201d but Pietrucha sensed he would be more successful elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI sat down with Spice and his wife, and I said, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take,\u2019\u201d Pietrucha recalled. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know where the road is going to go for you because you\u2019re such a unique, talented individual. I don\u2019t think you belong sitting behind a desk.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Adams\u2019s growing online profile netted him small roles on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cDetroiters\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cBallers,\u201d where a Whistle employee took notice of him and reached out via direct message.\n\n\u201cFrom the first time I talked to him, I could tell that he cared, he\u2019s a family man, he wasn\u2019t doing this for fame or for money,\u201d said Josh Millan, a content manager at Whistle. \u201cHe was doing it to make people laugh. I think that resonates beyond anything else.\u201d", "description": "After nine years of playing in obscurity for the Chicago Bears and the San Francisco 49ers, Spice Adams has become ubiquitous for his memes.", "authors": ["Corban Goble"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/sports/24spice-promo/24spice-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
