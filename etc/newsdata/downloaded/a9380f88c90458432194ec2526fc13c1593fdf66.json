They are also discussing whether to make it public.\n\nThe details of the IRS complaint follow news of a separate, explosive whistleblower complaint filed in August by a member of the intelligence community.\n\nThat complaint revealed Donald Trump's request of Ukrainian leaders to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a political rival. It has spurred an impeachment probe on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe IRS complaint has come amid the escalating legal battle between the Treasury Department and House Democrats over the release of Mr Trump's tax returns. Part of that inquiry from Democrats is over how the IRS conducts its annual audit of the president and vice president's tax returns. That process is supposed to be walled off from political appointees and interference.\n\nThat was the focus of the whistleblower complaint. The people briefed on its contents said, for the first time, that the complaint pertained to allegations of interference in the audit process by at least one Treasury Department official. They also said, for the first time, that the complaint revealed that the whistleblower is a career IRS official.\n\nThe existence of a whistleblower complaint was revealed in a court filing several months ago, but little about it had become public.\n\nThe whistleblower's account focuses on the integrity of the government's system for auditing the president's and vice president's tax returns.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump sues to try and block prosecutors from getting his tax returns\n\nMr Trump has broken decades of precedent by refusing to publicly release his tax returns. Democrats filed a lawsuit earlier this year demanding the disclosure of those filings, invoking a federal law designed to give Congress access to any tax return.\n\nThe IRS complaint has received less attention but has divided government officials.\n\nTwo administration officials have described the complaint as hearsay and suggested it was politically motivated, but they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nDemocrats who have reviewed it regard it as a deeply significant allegation that, if true, suggests that political appointees may have tried to interfere with the government audit process, which was set up to be insulated from political pressures.\n\nKey parts of the complaint remain under wraps in part because of strict privacy laws that prevent the disclosure of any details related to the filing of tax returns.\n\nPeople who described the complaint spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nRepresentative Richard Neal, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee who received the whistleblower's complaint in July, said in court filings this summer that the complaint contains credible evidence of \"potential 'inappropriate efforts to influence' the audit programme.\"", "description": "An Internal Revenue Service official has filed a whistleblower complaint reporting that he was told that at least one Treasury Department political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president or vice president's tax returns, according to multiple people familiar", "authors": ["Josh Dawsey", "Tom Hamburger", "Jeff Stein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Nb7OOYKD2jnWG9DcrSpKEg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/09a4d4596f20bf6abda9b2d5530f4117", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
