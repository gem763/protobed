Where are the fixes to a health care system whose problems go far beyond the tens of millions of Americans still uninsured? What about education? Impeachment would shove all of those issues even further to the margins than they already are.\n\nDuring the Democratic primary and then the general election, the Trump melodrama and the Trump spectacle would overshadow all else. And many Americans\u2019 estrangement from Washington \u2014 their cynicism about its ability to improve their lives even a whit \u2014 would intensify.\n\nThat could be all the more true on account of their confusion. If you\u2019re favorably disposed toward Trump and receptive to his claims of persecution, you\u2019ve watched the meticulous and drawn-out work of Robert Mueller, you\u2019ve noticed a seemingly nonstop schedule of Capitol Hill hearings and of star witnesses (Michael Cohen, Mueller, Bill Barr, Corey Lewandowski), and you thought that the House Judiciary Committee was already doing an impeachment inquiry. The latest developments strike you as \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d on the Potomac.\n\nIf you\u2019re horribly offended and utterly exhausted by Trump, you\u2019re tempted to cheer impeachment as long-sought justice and prayed-for release and forget that it\u2019s just the prelude to the main act, which is a trial in the Senate. That chamber is controlled by Republicans, who, based on current conditions, are as likely to convict Trump as they are to co-sponsor Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax. So Trump\u2019s supporters would wind up furious that he was put through what they regarded as an overwrought exercise with a foregone conclusion, while the frustration of Trump\u2019s detractors would be exponentially multiplied. Let the healing begin!\n\nAnd would impeachment proceedings effectively lay bare \u2014 and force Americans to focus on \u2014 sins of Trump\u2019s that are being ignored? That\u2019s long been one of Democrats\u2019 arguments for impeachment, but I wonder. For starters, some of the hearings to date \u2014 Lewandowski\u2019s in particular \u2014 raise questions about their ability to pry loose what they want from witnesses and isolate the damning evidence amid the ambient vitriol. But more than that, there has been such saturation coverage of Trump that many voters may not be able to stomach it any more, and today\u2019s political tribalism doesn\u2019t allow for all that much in the way of epiphanies and transformations. Trump\u2019s true colors were conspicuous from the start. You either saw a perverse rainbow or you stared into darkness.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump. How vulnerable will drawn-out impeachment proceedings make him feel? How impotent? How desperate? To flex his power, vent his fury or distract the audience, what would he do? He\u2019s untethered by scruple. He\u2019s capable of anything. Maybe it\u2019s not just a culture war that he\u2019d whip up. Maybe it\u2019s the real thing.\n\nCertainly he\u2019d do all he could to persuade Americans of the nefariousness of Democrats, and absolutely his strategy would be to smear the people, the procedures and the institutions arrayed against him as utterly unworthy of trust. If holding on to power meant ruling over rubble, so be it. Trump is beholden only to Trump, and he\u2019d simply declare the rubble gold dust.", "description": "What\u2019s just and what\u2019s wise aren\u2019t always the same.", "authors": ["Frank Bruni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/opinion/bruninewsletter/merlin_161434137_a2843d12-02e9-4a3b-a8af-a38991943666-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
