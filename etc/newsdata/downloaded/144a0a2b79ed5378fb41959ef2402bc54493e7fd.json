She is also the co-founder and CEO of Mighty Well, which makes functional and stylish PICC line covers for individuals with catheters who face a range of challenges getting dressed.\n\nThe PICC line covers, designed for people who suffer from a range of conditions, are made from antimicrobial and moisture wicking fabric and wrap comfortably around the arm.\n\n\"A lot of people have cancer or chronic health conditions that maybe don't let them eat and they get their nutrition through a PICC line,\" Levy said.\n\nThe budding entrepreneur, whose mother worked for designer Giorgio Armani and whose father owned a surf shop, drew inspiration from the surfwear industry to create a practical solution that to her knowledge -- and apparently her doctors' -- didn't yet exist.\n\nShe learned about sportswear fabric technologies that had been developed for athletes and introduced the materials to products for patients like herself. She began applying for grants in college, and by the time she graduated, had been awarded $250,000 for her business.\n\nLevy likened \"adaptive wear,\" a category of clothing that caters to people with physical disabilities and other health conditions, to the plus-size apparel market a generation ago.\n\n\"We are really giving a face to this new category in the same way plus-size wear ten years ago really wasn't a thing and now it's the norm,\" she said.\n\nShe says the authenticity of her story has been key to her success.\n\n\"If you find that you have a deep passion and purpose for what you are doing, you'll wake up every day to keep pushing forward,\" she said.", "description": "Emily Levy launched Mighty Well after she discovered there was no practical medical product to protect her catheter", "authors": ["Megan Cerullo"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/22/c2d909be-3f71-4036-aa5b-7b0f3bc29915/thumbnail/1200x630/c5883a81bbd2cb7afebb172b9c68d87f/screen-shot-2019-05-22-at-1-32-23-pm.png"}
