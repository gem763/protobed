Banks and many restaurants and shops remained closed.\n\nA team of workers in grey jumpsuits was dispatched to clean up the debris near parliament, even as around a dozen protesters chanted \u201cRevolution, revolution\u201d.\n\nThe demonstrations first erupted on Thursday, sparked by a proposed 20 cent tax on calls via messaging apps such as WhatsApp.\n\nSuch calls are the main method of communication for many Lebanese and, despite the government\u2019s swift abandonment of the tax, the demonstrations quickly swelled into the largest in years.\n\nThousands of people of all ages, sects and political affiliations brought the capital to a standstill on Friday, before security forces dispersed them.\n\nMinor clashes continued after dark, pitting groups of young men against security forces, an AFP reporter said.\n\nOne protester in the southern city of Nabatieh, a Hezbollah stronghold, vowed to continue protesting.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to portray us as a mob, but we are demanding our rights,\u201d he told a local television channel.\n\n\u201cWe are used to repression.\u201d\n\nLebanon has one of the highest public debt burdens in the world and the government is trying to reach agreement on a package of belt-tightening measures to cap the deficit in next year\u2019s budget.\n\nThe promised austerity moves are essential if Lebanon is to unlock $11 billion in economic assistance pledged by international donors last year.\n\nGrowth has plummeted in recent years, with political deadlock compounded by the impact of eight years of war in neighbouring Syria.\n\nLebanon\u2019s public debt stands at around $86 billion \u2014 more than 150 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 according to the finance ministry.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 Hundreds gathered in Lebanon Saturday for a third day of protests against tax increases and alleged official corruption after the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/c86fab_lebanese-security-forces-say-70-arrests-dispersing-thousands-protesters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
