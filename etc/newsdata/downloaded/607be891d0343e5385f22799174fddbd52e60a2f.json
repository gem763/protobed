How do I get her to stop?\u201d The full story involves a number of details that are not particularly redeeming: The original poster actually cheated multiple times; some of his friends joined the ex in her cause because they no longer wanted to be associated with him and in fact actively disliked him; at no point did the poster acknowledge that this woman is obviously very funny! The post was eventually removed by the subreddit\u2019s moderators as potentially fake, but not before a screenshot of it went viral on Twitter and dozens of outlets circulated the story with headlines like \u201cGirl Gets Sweet, Fiery Revenge on Ex With \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Spoilers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I expected a bit of advice?\u201d he said when interviewed by New York magazine, incredulous, or pretending to be. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea why it was shut down.\u201d There are more than 1 million subreddits on Reddit, though the number of active communities is somewhere around 130,000. With 2.6 million members, r/relationships is currently number 73 on the site by size\u2014a little less popular than basketball, a little more popular than tattoos. Last month, it recorded more than 40 million pageviews, and added an average of 1,516 new members each day. This is a space to air your dirty laundry and request that perfect strangers tell you how to get the stains out. And as many different schools of thought as there are for red wine on silk, there are exponentially more for dealing with infidelity, dishonesty, poor personal hygiene, a partner who is perfectly kind in person but then tweets all his negative feelings about the relationship on a public Twitter account.\n\nYou can imagine the conversation spiraling out of control, but you rarely see it happen. That\u2019s because of Anne, a pseudonymous 58-year-old woman living in the mountains of California. She\u2019s been leading the moderation team for r/relationships for close to a decade\u2014long before mainstream publications started running roundups of the subreddit\u2019s worst stories\u2014and if you ask her, it\u2019s not even that hard to maintain civil discourse and community. The big secret? Just delete stuff.\n\n\u201cWe maintain [the community] by removing as much stuff as we remove,\u201d she told me flatly in a phone call, stating what should be obvious to me. Anne has been on the internet pretty much the whole time there\u2019s been anything to do here, holding on to the same username since the 1980s. She\u2019s been a chat-room manager and a forum guide; now she moderates more than a dozen subreddits, mostly pertaining to interpersonal relationships. (Anne is not her real name. She asked that I not \u201cdox\u201d her or any of the subreddit\u2019s other moderators and instead use pseudonyms, because their moderation style results in banning dozens of users every month, many of whom might harass her team indefinitely over their decisions.) Though she would never let anyone commit them to the public record of r/relationships, some of Anne\u2019s favorite words to use conversationally are elementary-school insults. As we talked, she called people \u201cbuttheads\u201d and \u201cassholes\u201d and \u201cpigs\u201d liberally\u2014mostly the men of notoriously seedy and misogynistic spaces like r/TheRedPill and r/MGTOW (\u201cMen Going Their Own Way\u201d). There\u2019s no troll post she hasn\u2019t seen before, no condescending jab she could ever find charming. Asshole isn\u2019t a word she uses because she\u2019s angry; it\u2019s just a clinical diagnosis of a person who operates by default in bad faith. \u201cI\u2019m a parent. I don\u2019t like bad behavior,\u201d Anne explained. She doesn\u2019t believe in getting worked up over it; she just believes in rooting it out. \u201cIt\u2019s our subreddit; it\u2019s our fiefdom. We don\u2019t have to explain ourselves to anybody,\u201d she said. She is perfectly aware that no one in r/relationships would mistake her for a democratic leader.\n\nAnne\u2019s rules forbid gendered insults, including \u201cbitch,\u201d obviously, but also \u201cdick,\u201d somewhat perplexingly. They forbid \u201calpha\u201d and \u201cbeta,\u201d because that dichotomy attracts the Red Pill crowd. They forbid external links or images of any kind. (\u201cPeople will go through a breakup and post revenge porn and we\u2019re not going to have that,\u201d Anne explained. \u201cOr they\u2019ll post 15 pictures of a text-message exchange. I would rather roll naked in my own vomit.\u201d) They forbid asking for upvotes, because \u201ckarma whores\u201d are bad for the integrity of the discussion. (The Reddit points system awards \u201ckarma\u201d based on how well user contributions are received by others, in the form of upvotes. You can get trophies!) They forbid political discussions and pull down anything with the words Trump, Clinton, or Obama. They dictate that posts include ages and genders for relevant parties in the title\u2014for example, \u201cMy (31F) husband\u2019s (32M) obsession with building rafts is becoming a detriment to our family life\u201d\u2014and that they end in a question. They also require that posts include a \u201cTL;DR\u201d (\u201ctoo long; didn\u2019t read\u201d) summarizing the story in a couple of sentences at the bottom; a moderation bot pulls down any that don\u2019t. (Trolling the bot by superficially following the rules doesn\u2019t really work, because the human moderators are typically only a half step behind. \u201cI removed something today because someone wrote \u2018TL;DR: It\u2019s a short post; read it,\u2019\u201d Anne said, laughing. \u201cYou know what? Fuck you.\u201d)\n\nAny thread that\u2019s linked to anywhere else online is shut down\u2014including every post linked to in this article, as a result of this article. Though it\u2019s a challenge to spot it every time, members of the community who copy-paste r/relationships stories, or even post links to them, in another subreddit can be instantly permabanned for cross-posting, which puts everyone at risk of a \u201cbrigade\u201d\u2014scores of trolls storming in, instigating arguments and causing distractions, robbing someone with a real question of the chance to get any useful advice. \u201cThey\u2019re popcorn-eaters,\u201d Anne told me. \u201cThey want the schadenfreude; they want to see a big production, and it\u2019s not what we want. We\u2019re here to serve the [original poster]. That\u2019s our purpose.\u201d Whether anybody has an issue with any of these rules is not immediately obvious, because meta-discussion of the subreddit or its moderators is also prohibited. Reddit has a complicated history with moderation, thanks to its early web 2.0 dedication to user-generated anything, and a sticky reputation as a hate-speech free-for-all. When the platform was smaller, users who wrote \u201cracist, sexist, or homophobic\u201d posts were reportedly banned on sight, but in 2012 the company made an ethical 180: \u201cWe stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it,\u201d then-CEO Yishan Wong told his staff in a leaked internal memo.\n\n\u201cReddit\u2019s supposed commitment to free speech is actually a punting of responsibility,\u201d the journalist Sarah Jeong wrote in her 2015 book, The Internet of Garbage. \u201cIt is expensive for Reddit to make and maintain the rules that would keep subreddits orderly, on-topic and not full of garbage (or at least, not hopelessly full of garbage). Only by giving their moderators near absolute power can Reddit exist in the first place.\u201d Like Anne, Jeong uses the word fiefdom to describe the political structure of a subreddit. In this metaphor, Reddit the company is a distant king, excused from getting his hands dirty no matter how vile Reddit the platform gets. Moderators are left to make all the hard decisions locally. By 2015, that policy had turned much of Reddit feral. When interim CEO Ellen Pao banned five infamously disgusting subreddits and fired a popular employee, she was met with violent harassment over the decisions and ultimately agreed to leave the company. Co-founder Steve Huffman stepped in and announced a confusing new code of conduct that drew strange lines, taking down a subreddit called r/rapingwomen but leaving up the racist cesspool r/coontown. This was also when the site introduced the idea of quarantining communities: Any content that violates \u201ca common sense of decency\u201d wouldn\u2019t be visible without logging in and deliberately seeking it out. (These pages also serve no ads and aren\u2019t indexed in search results. The biggest recent example is misogyny den r/TheRedPill, which was quarantined in September 2018.)\n\nRecently, as the Los Angeles Times highlighted in a profile of Reddit\u2019s advertising business, the site has been more interested in cleaning itself up\u2014banning one of the biggest incel subreddits and broadening its definitions of bullying and harassment. This is, explicitly, a business concern. Huffman told the Times that Reddit is looking to double its revenue growth for the third year in a row. It just raised a $300 million investment round from the Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent, valuing it at about $3 billion, and maintaining this kind of growth requires Reddit to be a suitable partner for the big-name brands that can afford massive advertising contracts. But at the level of an individual subreddit, things are more personal. Before r/relationships, Anne was a moderator in the similar but much more unruly r/relationship_advice, where she had to teach herself how to do the job. \u201cNobody trained me; nobody told me what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI just saw appalling things going on.\u201d Years before anyone was talking about incels, Anne saw them writing in for advice: \u201cI like this girl a lot and she won\u2019t go out with me so I want to kill her.\u201d She saw pile-ons from homophobes and misogynists and racists. Most of all, she saw a space that could be useful if only someone would step up, set the terms, and outlaw conversational gasoline like \u201cpussy\u201d and \u201ccuck.\u201d Anne and a couple of other moderators from that subreddit took over r/relationships (which had been founded a few years prior but mostly abandoned) and created a new set of rules with hard lines.\n\nThe ideological divide between r/relationships and r/relationship_advice has created a not-so-secret rivalry between the two subreddits, and something like a controlled experiment for the way the internet can, or should, be moderated. In a 2015 paper parsing the \u201cvirtues of moderation,\u201d the Cornell Law School internet-platform expert James Grimmelmann identified four types of behavior that moderation is meant to excise: congestion, cacophony, abuse, and manipulation. But taken in total, he wrote, \u201cmoderation is how online communities walk the tightrope between overuse and underuse.\u201d Both r/relationships and r/relationship_advice deal in extremely similar subject matter, but have nearly opposite philosophies on reining in use of the space\u2014one rigid, one loose. The top posts on r/relationship_advice are examples of things Anne and her team might shut down immediately: \u201cHusband put Viagra in my drink,\u201d and \u201cFound my wife\u2019s condoms. We\u2019ve never used condoms in our 10 year relationship.\u201d The posts have hundreds of comments, some of them sincere, but many of them building on one another in a classic style of internet riff that sets the original poster up as the butt of the joke. If, as Grimmelmann argued, moderation\u2019s biggest challenge is to create \u201cstrong shared norms,\u201d you could say that both subreddits have succeeded. But while r/relationship_advice abides by norms that are broadly accepted by the entire platform and much of the web, the norms that guide r/relationships are much more narrow.\n\nShortly after Anne started r/relationships, a friend who was moderating r/relationship_advice got in a big, public argument with a commenter, and then banned the person in a huff. \u201cThat\u2019s a no-no. Our thing is, you have to stay detached,\u201d Anne said. \u201cIf you give advice, you can give advice, but you can\u2019t be the one to remove things on that post.\u201d That day alone, she estimates, about 25,000 people came over from r/relationship_advice to r/relationships. In July 2016, Reddit announced a major change to its points system. Text-only posts had been ineligible for karma for the past eight years \u201cdue to various shenanigans and low effort content,\u201d but the decision was going to be reversed. This meant, all of a sudden, that there would be an incentive to post in r/relationships other than to sincerely request and receive advice. The subreddit\u2019s membership was already significant, but it spiked after the change, as Reddit users realized that they could get tons of attention for dramatic stories or zinger responses\u2014real or fake. Anne has a handpicked team of three dozen people in various time zones, most of whom volunteer a few hours a week. One of them, Michael, lives in North Carolina and works as a pharmaceutical researcher. He started reading r/relationships in 2014 and was tapped as a moderator in 2017, after he helped track down a serial poster who was trying to game the karma system. The perpetrator wrote a series of posts over the course of about a month. \u201cThen,\u201d Michael recalled to me, \u201cwe find out he\u2019d been posting in other subreddits, basically bragging about how he\u2019d kept a spreadsheet of what got how much karma and what kind of post he should focus on in the future.\u201d\n\nAll of the r/relationships moderators can spot a troll post a mile away, Anne said. There are hallmarks. \u201cIf I\u2019m reading something and I\u2019m not an active participant in the story and my immediate reaction is Oh, I\u2019m upset, it was probably written that way,\u201d Michael said. \u201cNow that I have my antennae up, I\u2019m looking at, How new is the username? How interactive is this person in the comments? Are they answering clarifying questions? Sometimes you have to let those things stay up for a while. And then you have to use your own discretion.\u201d The mods had a difficult time deciding whether to believe a story about a man who was attracted to his girlfriend only when she was grieving her dead sister, but it stayed up. Until it went viral, as did a story about a woman who murdered her boyfriend\u2019s pet bird out of jealousy. And a story about a man who became convinced his girlfriend was cheating on him, because he found a piece of poop in her toilet that was, to his eyes, too big to come from a woman. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of weird scenarios people find themselves in,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWith almost anything you can be like, Nobody would do that \u2026 would somebody do that? Somebody might do that.\u201d But Anne said she can\u2019t even remember any good examples of wild stories. She\u2019s read so many posts, it\u2019s all a blur\u2014every single thing a person might do to another person or because of another person, whether in reality or in imagination, has appeared before her eyes. This is maybe why she can speak so coolly of \u201cassholes\u201d and \u201cbad behavior,\u201d realities that she\u2019s accepted in the way most of us might accept that it\u2019s not always summer, or that our shoelaces have come untied.\n\nThis clinical approach creates some unsettling compromises. When posts about sexual assault come in, the moderators take them down immediately, with an auto-response suggesting that the poster go to a more specific subreddit that has counselors on its moderation staff. \u201cWe don\u2019t think with a subreddit this large that we\u2019d be able to manage that conversation, and we don\u2019t know if our subreddit has the expertise to actually provide helpful advice,\u201d Michael said. \u201cYou normally would need some kind of trauma training or counseling training.\u201d Anne gave me temporary moderator access to the back end of r/relationships while I was reporting this piece. The first time I logged in was a Sunday morning around 8, and the first thing I noticed was that four posts about rape had been automatically pulled down in the previous hour alone. It made sense to me why Anne and Michael would say r/relationships wasn\u2019t the best place for the writers to get adequate help, but seeing \u201cremoved - [rape]\u201d repeated back-to-back in a running list next to formatting infractions and link takedowns still made me queasy. If you\u2019re alone enough in a horrifying experience that your instinct is to write it up and post it in an enormous public forum, receiving an immediate, automated bounce-back can\u2019t possibly help. If anything, it\u2019s a very on-the-nose dismissal. This isn\u2019t the only situation in which r/relationships will exercise its right to sit your personal crisis out. Posts about abortion are typically removed because they tend to provoke vitriol that Anne said serves only to make the original poster \u201cfeel like shit.\u201d Posts about open relationships, which tend to be met with derision, might not be removed but are frequently locked for comments. Additionally, the moderators regularly point people to r/asktransgender or r/LGBT, saying that this will result in better advice.\n\n\u201cSome people are like, Yeah, that makes sense. Others are like, Well, why are you telling me that I can\u2019t post here? Those other subreddits are smaller; I\u2019m less likely to get a wide response,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWe stick to explaining that at the end of the day, we refer and remove posts as we deem fit; it\u2019s in the sidebar as a disclaimer, and our decisions are final.\u201d The idea of asking 2.6 million people to deliberate on how one should conduct one\u2019s personal life is, obviously, a chaotically optimistic one. And sometimes, the crowd just can\u2019t be trusted to handle it, even if technically no rules are being broken. \u201cI\u2019ll give you an example,\u201d Michael told me. \u201cThe title of the post was \u2018My brother has been asking to spend time alone with my daughter.\u2019\u201d I could see where that one was going: shut down, as soon as the team saw it. \u201cEven if that was a genuine question, the amount of division that would cause in the comment section would prevent that person from getting any usable advice. That was one where I was like, We got to nip this in the bud immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cThat person did not appreciate having their post removed.\u201d This kind of hyperactivity in the comments of individual posts is also why he\u2019d rather the popular Twitter account @redditships, which has been screenshotting and reposting r/relationships stories since May 2017, didn\u2019t exist. Community is what makes r/relationships worth visiting at all, but paradoxically, too many visits can threaten the balance: While it may be strange to hear a group this large described as a carefully siloed community, there really is a sharp difference between a regular r/relationships post and an r/relationships post that goes viral elsewhere. @redditships has 200,000 followers, and individual tweets regularly blow up, passing in front of a couple million additional eyeballs. It\u2019s easy enough to understand why. These slices of unfamiliar lives\u2014my boyfriend is obsessed with Dave and Busters; my wife called me \u201cPhil\u201d during sex\u2014are strange and possibly fake, gossip-y blind items pinned to people we know nothing else about, weirder and funnier than stories about even the quirkiest celebrities. A recent post titled \u201cMy (f 25) boyfriend (m 27) got angry when I asked him if I could put a face mask on him\u201d was posted to Twitter and retweeted just 161 times. But the average r/relationships question gets 30 to 70 responses. After the post accrued more than 2,000 comments, the thread was shut down with a note from a moderator: \u201cThis thread is locked because it got so popular it started attracting non-community members who don\u2019t care about following the rules. I hope you got some good advice, [original poster]. Good luck!\u201d why does every r/relationships post start off like \"me (21F) and my boyfriend (29M) of 5 years have been having issues lately--\" \u2014 Selena\ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udf6d\ud83e\udd87\ud83c\udf42\ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udf19 (@moonseelie) September 17, 2019 The idea is that anyone following a Twitter curation of r/relationships isn\u2019t actually helping, and the subreddit is explicitly about help. Most of the posts are boring, typical problems and FAQs about splitting finances and dealing with in-laws and asking for affection that\u2019s being withheld. People on Twitter don\u2019t necessarily care about that stuff. They\u2019re probably not going to come tell some teenager how to deal with sharp, unyielding loneliness. They\u2019re not invested, day after day, in the repetitive work of explaining what\u2019s reasonable to expect from people who say they love you. \u201cThe OP is everything,\u201d Anne said. \u201cWe can\u2019t function without the OP. We have to protect them.\u201d\n\nThe anonymous pair of friends who run @redditships see it less as an intrusion and more as a utility, one whose necessity was actually born in part of the very ugliness Anne and her fellow moderators are hoping to root out. \u201cI have it in my head that this serves an archival purpose,\u201d the account runner, who asked to go by Shal, told me in a phone call. \u201cA lot of these posts get deleted immediately and sometimes it\u2019s confusing, because they\u2019re genuine questions or they\u2019re just funny.\u201d @redditships, in Shal\u2019s eyes, is a public service that gives people the chance to see these human stories without slogging through Reddit. Shal said, emphasizing that Reddit is for white tech bros, and that as a queer person of color, they\u2019ve never felt that comfortable on the site. \u201c\u201cFor the most part, the advice is good. But not if you\u2019re part of a marginalized community or have specific issues that your average internet nerd wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d r/relationships really is just like \"i am engaged to the most terrible man you will ever meet. we are getting married soon\" \u2014 OR. .......Those Feratu (@tahoumarus) September 14, 2019 Michael estimates that 70 percent of the posts in r/relationships are about heterosexual couples. And this is, he admits, probably a result of the way the subreddit is moderated, combined with its reputation on Twitter, which influences \u201cwho knows about it, [and] who feels comfortable using it.\u201d Even then, it\u2019s hard to say exactly whom the subreddit serves best. Last year, the New Statesman scraped \u201chundreds\u201d of posts from the subreddit and analyzed them for potential gender bias, concluding, \u201cReddit\u2019s amateur agony aunts overwhelmingly support men over women in posts about heterosexual romantic relationships.\u201d\n\nBut that finding doesn\u2019t scan with Anne\u2019s experience. \u201cCompared to the rest of Reddit, which is a giant androgenic cesspool, we look biased in favor of females.\u201d She estimates that women make up about 60 percent of the membership of r/relationships. They seem to post an even larger percentage of the questions there. This is presumably a big part of what draws \u201cpopcorn-eaters\u201d and makes the whole thing so shareable. You\u2019re not allowed to post \u201cmen are trash\u201d on Facebook; generalized Twitter misandry is funny, but getting tired. But there are endless variations of a joke tweet about the extremely dysfunctional heterosexuality on display in r/relationships, most structured like this recent example: girls on r/relationships: my boyfriend is a mass murderer and flawed but he has a really sweet heart. should i stay with him? guys on r/relationships: my girlfriend painted her nails blue instead of the usual green. how do i break up with her in the most hurtful way possible? Really, if you were looking for a conspiracy to sully the reputation of men, you might find one scrolling through the titles of posts in r/relationships. Some days, it\u2019s a stream of situations so stereotypical of the jokes we make about the way men behave in heterosexual relationships, it\u2019s almost surreal: a jackpot of evidence that things really are as bad and dumb as women say they are. \u201cMy [26F] boyfriend [29M] spends all his time on his phone on communist meme Facebook pages and Twitter,\u201d starts a recent one. An all-timer: \u201cMy (32F) husband (35M) disturbed a wasp nest and without saying anything to us, he immediately runs PAST OUR CHILDREN, grabs his dog (a small terrier) and runs into the house, and LOCKS THE DOOR.\u201d\n\nAt the platform level, as Catherine Buni and Soraya Chemaly explained in a 2016 history of \u201cthe secret rules of the internet,\u201d \u201cthe details of moderation practices are routinely hidden from public view, siloed within companies and treated as trade secrets when it comes to users and the public.\u201d Twitter notoriously declines to comment on individual account suspensions, for vague reasons that make it difficult to know whether it even has a code of conduct that applies to everyone. Facebook is tiptoeing around accusations of anti-conservative bias while Republican lawmakers shout about free speech on commercial platforms. Maybe the first thing any living person would tell you about Reddit is that it has been glacially slow to combat hate speech, and that it is still unclear just what level of public disdain has to bubble up before the company takes action against particularly toxic communities. A week after she left Reddit, Ellen Pao published an op-ed in The Washington Post suggesting that there is no solution to the problem of moderation: Expecting internet platforms to eliminate hate and harassment is likely to disappoint. As the number of users climbs, community management becomes ever more difficult. If mistakes are made 0.01 percent of the time, that could mean tens of thousands of mistakes. And for a community looking for clear, evenly applied rules, mistakes are frustrating. They lead to a lack of trust. Turning to automation to enforce standards leads to a lack of human contact and understanding. No one has figured out the best place to draw the line between bad and ugly\u2014or whether that line can support a viable business model. But the rules that Anne applies to r/relationships are posted in full for anyone who\u2019d like to understand them; they apply at all times. They are somewhat arbitrary, and some of them, you could argue, are pretty bad. At the very least they\u2019re consistent, mostly unchanged for years\u2014the most recent addition was more than two years ago, Michael said, when the mods decided to limit posts to one update each.
