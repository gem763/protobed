The deadline for the records is Friday.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Democrats on Thursday expressed interest in hearing from Mulvaney in person after he held a rare press conference at the White House in which he said Trump wanted the Ukrainian government to investigate unproven 2016 election interference allegations about a hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) email server.When asked if what he described was a quid pro quo for military aid, Mulvaney responded by saying, \"We do that all the time with foreign policy.\" He then pointed to pressing Central American countries that receive U.S. aid to overhaul their immigration policies.\u201cGet over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney added.When asked if Mulvaney should testify, Rep.(D-Va.), a senior member of the House Oversight Committee, quickly responded with an emphatic \"yes.\"\"I guess having failed at discrediting the facts of this case, they've decided on a new tactic, which is to admit them and basically say, 'So what?' And the answer to that is, 'Well, the \"so what\" is you're going to be impeached,'\" Connolly said. \"Because that's abuse of office. And extortion, the last time I checked, is still a crime.\"\n\nMulvaney later tried to walk back his comments in a statement released by the White House.\n\n\n\n\"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption,\" Mulvaney said.\n\n\n\nRep.
