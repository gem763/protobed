Calling Gabbard \u201cdead wrong,\u201d Buttigieg went on to say, \u201cthe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It\u2019s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.\u201d\n\nSanders came across as about the most radiant 78-year-old in history who had recently been in intensive care.\n\nMuch of the breathless pre-debate handicapping focused on how Bernie Sanders would look in his first major appearance after his heart attack. Maybe it was his constitution, maybe it was his doctors, or maybe it was knowing that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was about to give him her endorsement, but Sanders came across as about the most radiant 78-year-old in history who had recently been in intensive care.\n\nJoe Biden, in his best debate of the cycle, avoided any serious flare-ups over his son Hunter\u2019s profitable but legal business dealings in Ukraine. Rightly reluctant to buttress Donald Trump\u2019s frenzied tweets, the other Democrats on stage let Biden\u2019s statement stand: \u201cI never discussed a single thing with my son on anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We have always kept everything separate.\u201d\n\nIf the Cheaper by the Dozen Debate is remembered a year from now, it will probably be as the night when Elizabeth Warren discovered gravity. She has floated far above the Democratic field with a near-flawless campaign since Groundhog\u2019s Day, but last night, Warren suddenly discovered what it felt like to be a political target.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator brought on part of it herself with her exasperating refusal to depart from her non-revealing talking points about Medicare for All. Warren also sounded like a Tulsi Gabbard isolationist when she said, \u201cI think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nWarren aides later tried to walk back her comments, telling the New York Times that she was merely referring to U.S. troops in active combat. But the slip-up was telling\u2014Warren is usually precise in her speeches; this may have been the first time that campaign officials had to resort to the \u201cwhat Elizabeth meant to say\u201d defense.\n\nBombarded from all sides, Warren could also sound mildly exasperated at times, a far cry from the joyful Warren of the campaign trail, who bounds on stage, tells personal stories, and poses for selfies.\n\nBut no one looked more out of place than billionaire Tom Steyer, who, cynically gaming the DNC\u2019s system for debate qualifications, spent a staggering $47 million in the third quarter to goose his poll numbers enough to qualify. That worked out to about $7 million for every minute that Steyer spoke during the debate without ever uttering a memorable sentence.\n\nThe Democratic Party would have been far better off if the ego-tripping Steyer (who has already qualified for the November debate) had squandered that $47 million on a minor Renoir.\n\nIn the end, we learned that Warren can be vulnerable; Biden and Sanders are not over the hill; and Buttigieg and Klobuchar have potential in Iowa where both are making a major effort. All in all, an intriguing night filled with new plot twists for the 2020 Democrats.", "description": "Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg came out swinging during the fourth Democratic debate.
