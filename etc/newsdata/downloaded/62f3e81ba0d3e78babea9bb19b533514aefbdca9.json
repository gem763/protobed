REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nBOSTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc became the latest institution to drop Fisher Investments as a money manager after allegations that firm founder Ken Fisher made sexist comments at a conference, a regulatory filing showed on Friday.\n\nThe filing states Fisher\u2019s asset management unit will no longer be a subadviser to the $600 million Goldman Sachs Multi-Manager Global Equity Fund, effective on or around Oct. 31.\n\nA Goldman Sachs spokesman did not comment on how much Fisher manages for the fund or give a reason for the change. Fisher was among 10 outside managers listed by the fund in a company disclosure as of March.\n\nA spokesman for Fisher did not immediately comment.\n\nEven before Goldman Sachs\u2019 move Fisher\u2019s firm had faced more than $2.5 billion in withdrawals by other big investors over comments Fisher reportedly made at an investor conference this month. According to a conference attendee, Fisher made derogatory remarks about genitalia and picking up girls among other topics.\n\nAfter a public backlash, Fisher apologized in a memo to his firm\u2019s employees on Oct. 11. That was not enough for some organizations that have pulled money including pension fund managers in Michigan, Iowa, the Los Angeles\u2019 fire and police pension system and Fidelity Investments. Other pension systems have put Fisher under review.\n\nSpeaking at a public meeting in Los Angeles on Thursday Fisher Investments Chief Executive Damian Ornani said the firm still has about $114 billion under management and has been adding other institutional investors as clients.", "description": "Goldman Sachs Group Inc became the latest institution to drop Fisher Investments as a money manager after allegations that firm founder Ken Fisher made sexist comments at a conference, a regulatory filing showed on Friday.", "authors": ["Ross Kerber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444894420&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O18E", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
