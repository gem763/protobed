We were like twins, she's literally my other half.\n\n\"We need to find her. It has to happen. We need to find her. She needs to come home.\"\n\nThe last footage taken of Amelia was at the party and shows her chatting with friends and posing for pictures.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nRyan, who was part of the group travelling Cambodia with the Amelia, contacted the police when Amelia failed to show up as arranged.\n\nHe said: \"We met in Phnom Penh. She was one of the first people I meet there.\n\n\"It's definitely out of character for Amelia not to show up. She always sticks with the groups and doesn't wander off on her own. This is definitely out of character.\"\n\nKouch Chamroeun, the Governor of Sihanoukville and General Thong Lim, Secretary General of the Cambodian Coastal Management and Development Committee, are co-ordinating the search for Amelia.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe divers searched the waters around the island, some 130 miles from the capital Phnom Penh, and drones were used to scour the dense jungle and coastline.\n\nAmelia's mother Linda Bambridge, 52, and other family members have flown out to join the search.\n\nShe is hoping that Amelia got \"lost on her way back\" and the search party will be able to find her.\n\nAmelia left the UK last month after completing an apprenticeship.\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\nIt is her first time travelling on her own and her family said she saved up for two years to fund it.\n\nGeorgie said: \"She is strong minded, really sensible and very organised.\n\n\"She spent the last year Googling solo female travelling, looking at pages and blogs and sorting out everything.\n\n\"I'm just in shock. She has never done anything like this before.\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\nThe hostel where Amelia was staying still has her passport.\n\nPolice have released an image of Amelia's backpack and its contents.\n\nThe bag contains a small purse, several packs of over-the-counter medication, her mobile phone, a phone charger, headphones, bank cards, a watch, a lighter, a pen, a tourist SIM card, a small padlock, a nail file and a keyring.\n\nA Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: \"We are assisting the family of a British woman who has been reported missing in Cambodia and are in close contact with the Cambodian police.\"", "description": "Video clip shows Amelia Bambridge, 21, from Worthing, West Sussex, at the beach party on the island of Koh Rong where she was last seen", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Bbc", "Facebook", "Pa", "Viralpress"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20729233.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHP_261019Slug_11142JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
