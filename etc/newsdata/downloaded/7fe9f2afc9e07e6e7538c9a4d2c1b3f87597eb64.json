A tragic scene tbh \u2014 DaBaby/Tierra Whack Fan Account (@mkrwrt) September 30, 2019\n\nThe only problem? \u2018Ye just about refuses to release it.\n\nOriginally scheduled to hit streaming services and music stores on September 27, the album was then played in full for a bunch of live listening parties in Chicago and New York before the release date was moved back to September 30.\n\nNow, on October 1, we are one day past the updated release date and four days past the original schedule. And still\u2026 there is no \u2018Jesus is King.\u2019\n\nThe Kanye subreddit is snapping ????#JesusIsKing pic.twitter.com/tXAZYC2Mpv \u2014 Fadawah | Vincent Buyssens (@Fadawah) September 30, 2019\n\nDespite Kanye announcing the release of an iMax spectacular movie/documentary/art project to be released on October 25, also called \u2018Jesus is King\u2019, people are not at all impressed with Ye\u2019s decision to keep pushing back the album\u2019s release.\n\nOf course, all of this was compounded when news started trickling out that that the album might not even have a release date at all anymore!\n\nThe pains of being a @kanyewest fan pic.twitter.com/fb0RDex3mC \u2014 Travis Bean (@tl_bean) September 30, 2019\n\nNow, those of you who follow Kanye closely probably aren\u2019t all that surprised by this album release drama. It\u2019s pretty much his bread and butter: build up anticipation, let people down momentarily, all before saving the day and giving desperate people what they want. This method is genius because often it doesn\u2019t even matter if what you gave them is good!\n\nMe when I got up today and saw Kanye didn\u2019t drop \u201cJesus is King\u201d pic.twitter.com/Q6QlC9Hkjx \u2014 Dan Barnes (@CCSDanBarnes) September 30, 2019\n\nIf you study Kanye's career you'll see he planned this all along \u2014 Imoh (@ImohUmoren) September 30, 2019\n\nHow some of y\u2019all look after believing Kanye\u2019s album coming out soon pic.twitter.com/zXeXHQDwk6 \u2014 Chris (@chnmoreno) September 30, 2019\n\nWhen you get to hear #JesusIsKing at the listening party but realize you may never hear it again since Kanye refuses to drop it pic.twitter.com/BRtiQH0qF5 \u2014 Ray Bartlett (@raymbartlett) September 30, 2019\n\nme thinking kanye was actually gonna drop #jesusisking pic.twitter.com/HpmOeUYXqO \u2014 king k (@_ohkkay) September 30, 2019\n\nMe waiting for the new Kanye album to drop since Friday pic.twitter.com/zfwIRSHfFY \u2014 Ana Jaks (@ana_jaks) September 30, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of theories about what caused the album delay \u2013 and while one biblical reading of the mess is quite interesting to think about\u2026\n\nkanye is making us wait 3 days because funny jesus man died and walked again after 3 days \u2014 Luccio (@luccio__) September 30, 2019\n\n\u2026it\u2019s far more likely that Mr. Kanye West just straight-up \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d\n\nAt this point, just be thankful if we ever hear the damn thing.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/hfdjdfjdgjdf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
