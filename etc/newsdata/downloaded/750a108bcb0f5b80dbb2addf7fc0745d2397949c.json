He leads the Weiss Ratings team of analysts and computer programmers who created Weiss cryptocurrency ratings.\n\n______________\n\nAs we cross the threshold into the next decade, what truly is in store for crypto investors?\n\nWill Bitcoin be many times more valuable by the end of the decade?\n\nOr will it be mostly dead?\n\nWill it be replaced by cryptocurrencies with more advanced technology?\n\nIf so, will those cryptocurrencies have begun to replace most fiat currencies?\n\nWhat about digital assets controlled by companies like Facebook or JPMorgan Chase?\n\nBefore I can answer these questions about the future, let\u2019s first look back at the past ...\n\nWhen Bitcoin was born ten years ago, the world was torn by financial crisis.\n\nIt was 2008.\n\nMajor governments had piled up massive debts.\n\nLehman Brothers failed, triggering a chain reaction of even greater failures in the banking system.\n\nGovernments responded by printing unlimited quantities of money.\n\nAnd Bitcoin was born as Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s indignant response to the mess they created.\n\nThe dream: To create a peer-to-peer system of electronic cash, killing three birds with one stone:\n\nOne: Bitcoin would unshackle money from the control of those who created the financial crisis.\n\nTwo: It would replace their behind-the-scenes deliberations and manipulations with the first-ever form of money that has a built-in monetary policy.\n\nThree: The monetary policy would be stable, predictable and completely transparent \u2014 visible to everyone.\n\nThat was the dream. But it has not been the reality.\n\nBitcoin will more closely resemble a store of wealth (like gold) than a system of electronic cash.\n\nHere\u2019s what actually happened ...\n\nWhen Bitcoin creators looked at fiat money, there was little desire to sort out the good from the bad. Instead Bitcoin\u2019s specs were deliberately designed to be the exact antithesis of every critical aspect of existing monetary policy.\n\nSpecifically, in these four ways ...\n\n1. Fiat money supply is unlimited and forever expandable. So, the creators designed Bitcoin\u2019s money supply to be strictly capped and immutable.\n\n2. To enforce that cap, they established a strict rule: Approximately every four years, the supply of new Bitcoin being created will be slashed by 50%, until ultimately any new Bitcoin creation becomes negligible. The next halving is expected in May of 2020, and should help to kick off what could be the next big leg in the current Bitcoin bull market\n\n3. Access to fiat digital money is dictated by banks. So, they designed Bitcoin to be free for everyone and anyone to use as they see fit.\n\n4. The fiat money system is made up of multiple gatekeepers and custodians who are regulated by a central government and trusted by the people. In contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s code stipulates that there are NO gatekeepers, NO custodians, NO regulators and NO governments in the mix.\n\nThis was the theory. But in practice, these strict design choices have taken a heavy toll on the Bitcoin network over time:\n\nSince Bitcoin is scarce, most people are usually reluctant to spend it. Instead, they simply hoard it in the expectation that, with time, its value will always go up ...\n\nSince there is no formal authority, an oligopoly of miners has emerged who control the minting of most new Bitcoins ...\n\nAnd since Bitcoin lacks adequate governance to select custodians, certain groups of developers have seized control over most of the network\u2019s development.\n\nSo, with the benefit of hindsight, it\u2019s very possible that \u2026\n\nBitcoin was an overreaction to the financial crisis and to the monetary system that allowed the crisis to occur.\n\nBut today, instead of functioning as an efficient peer-to-peer system for transferring cash, Bitcoin is evolving into a store of value like gold.\n\nWe don\u2019t really see a lot of changes being made, so \u201cstore of value\u201d will likely end up being its only function by the end of the next decade.\n\nNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but it does leave the door open for other projects to pick up the slack and take on the mantle of \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash\u201d.\n\nThe good news is stores of value are in high demand in today\u2019s world of geopolitical and financial uncertainty. Like gold, Bitcoin still retains the potential to rise dramatically in value.\n\nMoreover, the fact remains that Bitcoin introduced the first public, open, digital asset the world has ever seen. Bitcoin was the first successful experiment with Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). And in recent years, that revolutionary technology has evolved rapidly.\n\nSo, what comes next? Looking ahead to the next decade, we can see how ...\n\nDLT could contribute not only to the evolution of money and the stability of monetary policy ... it could also enhance economic productivity, political governance, social cohesion and more.\n\nDLT could revolutionize democratic elections, transform the world of lending and massively disrupt social media. So, the potential for cryptocurrencies to change the world is big, much bigger than originally expected ten years ago.\n\nIn fact, whether or not Bitcoin can deliver on its original promise is now a moot point. Other cryptocurrencies are rising to the occasion to fulfill the original dream ... plus much more.\n\nYes, the invention of Bitcoin broke the ice ...\n\nIt unleashed teams of developers and thinkers who are passionate about a decentralized digital cash system. They are fixing the deficiencies of Bitcoin and fine-tuning their algorithms to create a currency for the masses.\n\nMore recently, it has also unleashed a parallel trend of a very different kind: Regulators and gatekeepers of the traditional financial system see the writing on the wall.\n\nThey have become increasingly aware of the powerful advantages that DLT could bring to the table. And they are already looking for ways to adapt, adopt \u2014 or co-opt \u2014 the new technology to modernize the existing system.\n\nDepending on which of these prevails, there are two possible scenarios on how cryptocurrencies evolve over the next decade:\n\nScenario A: Decentralized DLT\n\nPublic open ledgers and their native cryptocurrencies begin to replace the fiat currency system. Instead of saving, spending or investing dollars, euros or yen, people begin to do all those things with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano or EOS.\n\nA growing share of the population transitions from government-issued currency to public cryptocurrencies. They are attracted to crypto by handy, practical distributed applications (dapps), powered by free and open cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis activity is not controlled by government or government-regulated institutions. It\u2019s governed by the consensus of each community.\n\nInitially, governments resist. But eventually, they accept the new reality. They realize they can no longer control the monetary system the way they used to. Instead of bucking the trend, they begin to recognize these new forms of money as legal tender.\n\nNo currency emerges as the sole winner. Rather, a select group of cryptocurrencies becomes dominant, thanks to superior technology, the most practical applications and the broadest mainstream acceptance.\n\nScenario B: The Centralized DLT Scenario\n\nGovernments and corporations of the world\u2019s largest economies \u2014 the U.S., the European Union, China and Japan \u2014 lead the way toward adopting Distributed Ledger Technology.\n\nThey realize that digital money is the wave of the future. And they see that the single, most-efficient form of digital money is based on DLT.\n\nBUT instead of creating open, decentralized systems, they focus on digital money systems that mimic the fiat system already in place.\n\nYes, the technology is similar. But the governance is not: The new kinds of money remain under the direct control of central banks.\n\nFor political and business leaders who crave more power and control, it\u2019s an upgrade: Government and corporate agents gain the ability to directly monitor every single transaction in the system. They are empowered to freeze accounts with a few clicks of a mouse.\n\nAnd once various kinds of property are digitized, a government or company decree to confiscate assets of targeted groups can be executed in seconds.\n\nThe technology is still distributed ledger. But instead of opening the network to everyone (a permissionless system), those who wish to join must first get the okay from some type of entity (a permissioned system).\n\nFacebook\u2019s Libra is a good example of the latter. Bitcoin, the former.\n\nAnd instead of relying on the rules embedded in the code to ensure fairness (a trustless system), participants must accept the authority of the rulers (a trusted system).\n\nIn a country with strong democratic traditions and judicial protections, this would not be of immediate concern. The government is expected to act in the best interests of the people. It\u2019s assumed it will use its new digital superpowers strictly against rogue actors.\n\nBut in countries already leaning toward autocracy or with no independent judiciary to speak of, the picture goes from dark to darker: Those governments will use centralized DLT to snuff out whatever individual freedoms remain.\n\nAnd what about companies that don\u2019t exactly have a pristine record when it comes to handling your personal data? Think Facebook and Cambridge Analytica here.\n\nHow can two starkly different scenarios be enabled by the same technology?\n\nRemember: All technology is inherently neutral. It can be tool of evolution or a weapon of destruction; a blade for harvest or for war.\n\nDLT is a prime example. It\u2019s one of the most revolutionary technologies on the planet. It can help enhance individual freedom, guarantee property rights and build wealth.\n\nOr, it can be used by authoritarian governments and companies to install a draconian surveillance state.\n\nTen years from now, which will it be? A lot will depend on which scenario prevails: Decentralized DLT or centralized DLT?\n\nMy guess is that, for now at least, we could wind up with an unholy mix of both. But in the longer term, decentralized DLT will always have two major advantages:\n\nFirst, DLT derives its greatest power from voluntary mass participation. But centralized DLT represses that mass participation. It\u2019s contrary to the essence of what DLT does best.\n\nSecond, even if private entities can create their own form of cryptocurrency that\u2019s fully under their control, it will be almost impossible for them to ban decentralized DLT networks.\n\nIn the end, the same dynamic that ultimately makes democracies stronger than dictatorships will also make decentralized DLT stronger than the centralized alternative.", "description": "As we cross the threshold into the next decade, what truly is in store for crypto investors?
