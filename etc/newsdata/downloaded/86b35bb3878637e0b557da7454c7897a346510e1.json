If they can make it to Oct. 1, they\u2019ll immediately get three new star relievers with amazing stuff. General Manager Mike Rizzo says so.\n\nWhat neither Rizzo nor ownership provided all year will be granted by the providence or happenstance of a calendar page turning to October.\n\nIn the late innings of a wild-card game, or to close out a Game 5 or Game 7 in a postseason series, the Nats\u2019 three new relievers will be Patrick Corbin, Stephen Strasburg and Scherzer.\n\nYes, the same gents who, in a few days, will be the first trio on any staff ever to have 222 strikeouts each. Why, you might even see one in a crucial mid-series swing game. They\u2019ll be the Big Three Lurkers.\n\n\u201cThe hell with roles. There are games when it\u2019s all hands on deck,\u201d said Rizzo on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s been that way for a long time. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ll do it, too, if we get the right circumstances.\u201d\n\nBoswell: As the Nationals enter the MLB wild-card stretch run, the stakes are higher than imagined\n\nRizzo only wears his 2001 World Series ring, earned when he was assistant GM at Arizona, on one day a year \u2014 his team\u2019s photo day \u2014 as a reminder of \u201cwhy we play.\u201d Looking down at that ring, he says, \u201cWho won Game 7 of that Series for us, getting the last four outs, after he\u2019d pitched seven innings the day before to win Game 6?\n\n\u201cRandy Johnson.\u201d\n\nThen Rizzo went through the list: Chris Sale pitched the final inning of the World Series last season to nail down Boston\u2019s title. Clayton Kershaw, with one day\u2019s rest, closed out Game 5 on the Nats in a National League Division Series in \u201916. On two days\u2019 rest, Madison Bumgarner pitched the last five innings to win Game 7 of the 2014 World Series for the Giants. And the Nats used Scherzer out of the \u2019pen in NLDS Game 5 in \u201917. (Yes, he lost.)\n\nIn front of Nats Park, there\u2019s a statue of the winning pitcher in Game 7 of the \u201924 World Series. At age 36, on one day\u2019s rest, he shut out the New York Giants in the ninth, 10th, 11th and 12th innings \u2014 Walter Johnson. This has been going on a long time. But we always forget.\n\nEspecially, we forget that the 2019 Nationals are the rare team that has three aces, all of them with the prototypical bullpen arsenal of an elite fastball plus at least one wipeout secondary pitch for strikeouts.\n\nBetween the end of the regular season and the last game of the World Series, there are 11 days off, even if every series goes the maximum number of games. You can work this out on your notepad: A team like the Nats \u2014 or the Astros and Dodgers, who are also loaded with dominant starters \u2014 will almost never face a game when they do not have at least one of their Big Three available on at least two days\u2019 rest.\n\nHouston and L.A. probably won\u2019t use them that way, or maybe only in a win-or-go-home crisis, because their bullpens are good. The Nats? Aside from Doolittle, who\u2019s first rate if he returns to normal form, who else are you going to summon with a wild-card game or a division series in the balance, either as a bridge to Doolittle or to finish it for good or ill? Strasburg has said in the past, with enthusiasm, that he\u2019d pitch in playoff relief. Scherzer has, Corbin would.\n\nOf course, the Nats, if they are fortunate to go deep in the playoffs, are not going to do this over and over. But if, hypothetically, the Nats get to the NL Championship Series, I think all of the Big Three would be used in relief at least once and some twice \u2014 all in the most critical spots. Get serious: Season on the line, it\u2019s not going to be Wander Suero or Tanner Rainey. Fernando Rodney (326 saves) has the grit for such spots. But he\u2019s 42.\n\nAlso, the Nats are not paying Scherzer, Strasburg and Corbin a total of $525 million \u2014 all of it guaranteed \u2014 to lose with their seventh-best pitcher.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what you paid for,\u201d said Rizzo on Friday. \u201cWe always say that top starting pitching is the key to sustained excellence. You pay for that [team-first] character and competitive attitude. Those three are out to win more than anybody I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nFor those who think that the Nats\u2019 current playoff quest defines \u201cquixotic\u201d because it is doomed to fail in October, maybe a rethink is worthwhile. True, the Nats\u2019 bullpen ERA is still the absolute worst in all of MLB (5.39). Rizzo\u2019s trade-deadline relief additions have, at best, been modest upgrades. And Manager Dave Martinez still makes stunning decisions, like calling Aaron Barrett with a 10-3 lead against the Twins on Thursday, but, sentimentally, leaving him in so long that Rodney faced slugger Nelson Cruz and all-star Jorge Polanco when both represented the tying run.\n\nPresumably, if Scherzer or Strasburg pitches seven inning of a wild-card game, it won\u2019t exceed Martinez\u2019s wisdom to let Corbin end it.\n\nThe Nats themselves probably have more confidence in their own bullpen than anybody outside that clubhouse. They think much of the problem all season has been a shortage of trusted arms, leading to sequential overuse \u2014 and the inevitable inefficiency or injury.\n\n\u201cGoing to starters in relief in the playoffs \u2014 that\u2019s not a guarantee,\u201d said Nats vet Ryan Zimmerman. \u201cWhen these guys in our bullpen, who know how to handle that role, have [normal] rest, they\u2019re tough. With all the off days in the playoffs, they should be good.\u201d\n\nThat applies to some, not others. Current closer Daniel Hudson has a 0.96 ERA on two-to-four days of rest, but 4.25 otherwise. But, in general, a dubious bullpen is blessed by loads of October days off.\n\nNow, feel free to go back to worrying about the Nats\u2019 recent stumbles, going 4-7 in a streak of games against playoff-quality foes. Fret about that historically homely \u2019pen all you want. If anything sends the Nats\u2019 wild-card hopes into cardiac arrest, it\u2019s liable to be them.\n\nBut if the Nats make it to October, they\u2019re going to get three new relievers. Their spots will be picked carefully. But one, and sometimes two of them, will not have to be told \u201cwear your spikes today,\u201d even when they\u2019re not starting. They\u2019ll already know.\n\nSleep better.
