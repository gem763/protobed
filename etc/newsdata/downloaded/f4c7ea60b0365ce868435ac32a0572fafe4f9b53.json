Instead, a mixed crowd made up of hardcore protesters in black wearing masks alongside families with children marched for more than 1.2 miles, some waving U.S. and British flags.\n\nHONG KONG\u2019S CARRIE LAM SAYS WITHDRAWAL OF EXTRADITION BILL OWN DECISION, NOT BEIJING\u2019S\n\n\u201cWe hope our children have a future, because now in Hong Kong, we cannot see any hope,\u201d a woman named Charis, who brought her 7-month old daughter to the demonstration, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe need to stand here, we need to walk here.\"\n\nThe march featured protesters who burned Chinese flags and tore down banners congratulating China's ruling Communist Party, which will celebrate its 70th year in power on Oct. 1. In familiar scenes, some protesters smashed glass windows and surveillance cameras at a subway station exit.\n\nSome protesters also carried large American flags and a large banner that read, \"President Trump Please Liberate Hong Kong.\"\n\nMany in the crowd also sang \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d a new anthem of the protest movement, according to videos from those at the scene.\n\nEarlier Sunday, hundreds of protesters waved British flags, sang \"God Save the Queen\" and chanted \"UK save Hong Kong\" outside the British Consulate as they stepped up calls for international support for their campaign.\n\nWith banners declaring \"one country, two systems is dead,\" they repeated calls for Hong Kong's former colonial ruler to ensure the city's autonomy is upheld under agreements made when it ceded power to China in 1997. Demonstrators held similar rallies Sept. 1 at the British facility and last weekend at the U.S. Consulate.\n\nThe marches disrupted traffic, and many shops, including the Sogo department store in Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong's largest department stores, closed their doors.\n\nHundreds of protesters later targeted the government office complex, throwing bricks and petrol bombs through police barriers. They were met by police responding with tear gas and water cannon trucks to spray chemical-laced water as well as a blue liquid to help them identify suspects.\n\nProtesters retreated, but regrouped in the nearby Wan Chai neighborhood, setting a fire outside a subway station exit and on the streets. They fled again after riot police advanced.\n\nSeveral fights were also reported on city streets, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nWARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT\n\nVarious videos on social media showed people clashing on city streets into the night.\n\nJAMES CARAFANO: HONG KONG PROTESTS, TRADE WAR WITH TRUMP RATTLE CHINA\u2019S LEADER \u2013 EXPECT SURPRISES\n\nPolice had earlier warned in a statement that the assembly was illegal and urged protesters to \"stop their illegal acts.\"\n\nThe protests were triggered in June by an extradition bill that many saw as an example of China's increasing intrusion and at chipping away at Hong Kong residents' freedoms and rights, many of which are not accorded to people in mainland China.\n\nHong Kong's government promised this month to withdraw the bill, which would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city's leaders and police accountability.\n\nMore than 1,300 people have been arrested amid increasing clashes between protesters and police, who demonstrators have accused of abuses.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe unrest has battered Hong Kong's economy, which was already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war. It is also seen as an embarrassment to Beijing, which has accused foreign powers of fomenting the unrest.\n\nPolice also banned a planned Civil Human Rights Front march on Aug. 31, but protesters turned up anyway. Clashes erupted that night, with police storming a subway car and hitting passengers with batons and pepper spray.\n\nOn Saturday, pro-democracy protesters and supporters of the central government in Beijing clashed at a Hong Kong shopping mall and several public places. Police arrested more than a dozen people and hospital authorities said 25 were injured.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The streets of downtown Hong Kong turned into the site of clashes between protesters and police on Sunday as the political turmoil continues in the global financial center for a 15th straight weekend.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
