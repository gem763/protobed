I am such a fan of hers,\" Moan said. \"But I do think, you know, you should cover your ground a little bit before you want to so intensely come for someone for taking something from you.\"\n\n\"If you are feeling so inspired by somebody, give them a platform,\" she continued. \"If you like something that they did, or came up with, hire them to come up with something for you. Buy something from them. Don't go behind their back and try to steal it and backpedal.\"\n\nMoan hopes that, given the media coverage of this controversy, big names and businesses will move to \"incorporate the queer and other minority artists that are underground into the projects that they're doing.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Diet Prada shared a 'mood board' that allegedly inspired Grande's tour outfits\n\nDiet Prada, a fashion watchdog account with 1.5 million followers on Instagram, posted a slideshow of images labeled \"Sweetener Mood Board.\"\n\nAccording to the account, which is run by Tony Liu and Lindsey Schuyler, the collection of images was shared with multiple designers, who were approached by Grande's team to create onstage looks for her \"Sweetener World Tour.\" (Versace was ultimately chosen to design six custom-made outfits for the 2019 tour.)\n\nRead more: 52 photos that show Ariana Grande's dramatic style evolution, from Nickelodeon teen to global phenomenon\n\nDiet Prada claimed the mood board 'proof of Ariana Grande's appropriation of black aesthetics'\n\n\"If you've ever needed proof of Ariana Grande's appropriation of black aesthetics (beyond the obvious), it's all here,\" Diet Prada's caption reads.\n\nThe caption notes that 72 percent of the images \"features black women as a reference.\"\n\nRihanna performing at the 2016 VMAs, left, and Ariana Grande performing during the \"Sweetener World Tour.\" Charles Sykes/Invision/AP / Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, the vast majority of the mood board features Rihanna. It also includes a few photos of Ciara.\n\nGrande has been accused of appropriating black culture in the past, most notably with her popular single \"7 Rings.\" Some listeners say Grande lifted aspects of the hip-hop infused track from black artists like Soulja Boy and stole the video's pink trap house aesthetic from 2 Chainz (who went on to collaborate with Grande for a \"7 Rings\" remix).\n\nThe rapper Princess Nokia was among many critics who focused on the lyric, \"You like my hair? Gee thanks, just bought it,\" claiming it whitewashes the politics surrounding hair in black communities.\n\nRead more:Ariana Grande apologized for reposting a fan who said her '7 Rings' lyric about buying hair is 'gonna solve racism'\n\nGrande has also been scrutinized for her skin tone. Some critics say she has intentionally encouraged her own racial ambiguity in order to capitalize on the perceived \"coolness\" of blackness. Grande herself says her deep tan is thanks to her Italian heritage.\n\nGrande's stylist has come to her defense, saying he created the mood board\n\nLaw Roach, the celebrity stylist and Image Architect, re-posted Diet Prada on his Instagram story and defended Grande.\n\n\"I don't really understand this post,\" he wrote. \"This mood board was created by me (a black man) for her. So am [I] stealing from my own culture??? She didn't style herself people. She has trusted me for years with her image and lets me do me. Also who [in] the fashion industry isn't inspired by Rihanna?\"\n\nLaw Roach has styled famous clients like Ariana Grande and Zendaya. @luxurylaw/Instagram\n\nMany of Diet Prada's commenters appeared to agree with Roach, arguing that drawing inspiration from black artists isn't necessarily the same as appropriating black culture.\n\n\"I'm African American and I wouldn't necessarily say these images are 'black aesthetics' where did you get that from?\" one comment reads.\n\n\"Since when is drawing inspiration from a fashion icon like Rihanna considered cultural appropriation?\" reads another.\n\nMany commenters believe Grande is copying, but not appropriating. @dietprada/Instagram\n\n'OK but why didn't she just ask Creepyyeha for a costume?'\n\nEven as commenters defended Grande against accusations of appropriation, many do believe she has a \"copy-cat problem.\"\n\nAside from photos of Rihanna and Ciara, the rest of the mood board is comprised of screenshots from the Instagram account of Yeha Leung, a Brooklyn-based Asian designer who creates made-to-order bondagewear under the brand name Creepyyeha.\n\nAs Diet Prada notes, several of Grande's custom-made tour outfits closely resemble some of Leung's designs, which have been worn by stars like Lizzo and Dita Von Teese.\n\nSome of Grande's custom-made Versace outfits closely resemble Leung's designs. @creepyyeha/Instagram / Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Ariana Grande\n\nFor many, the similarities underscore Moan's original point: Big names and companies should hire lesser known artists, especially minority designers, rather than using them just for inspiration.\n\n\"so annoyed that she didn't just hire @creepyyeha for this, ariana's copy looks like a sad boohoo bootleg,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"why not just like ... i dunno Hire the brand that you're inspired by??? instead of having a different designer copy it?? shocking concept,\" another person wrote.\n\nVon Teese also commented, writing, \"Thank you for standing up for @creepyyeha.\"\n\n@creepyyeha/Instagram / Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Ariana Grande\n\nIt's also not lost on critics that Grande's team drew significant inspiration from an Asian designer after she was accused of exploiting Japanese culture \"for the aesthetic.\"\n\nBack in January, Grande got a now-infamous tattoo of two kanji characters, meant to say \"seven rings\" in Japanese. Instead, it was misspelled and actually translated to mean \"shichirin,\" which is a small BBQ grill.\n\nGrande has often expressed a love for Japan and Japanese culture. She began learning the language in 2015 and has demonstrated her progress on numerous occasions. Grande has even given online shout outs to her tutor Ayumi, who works at Fuji, a Japanese language school in little Tokyo, Los Angeles.\n\nBut after Grande admitted that she knew it was misspelled, critics thought her tattoo blunder indicated a disrespect for the language.\n\nRead more: This is why a white woman wearing a traditional Chinese dress is cultural appropriation\n\nGrande later consulted her tutor and tried to fix the tattoo, although it still technically didn't say \"seven rings.\"\n\n\"I can't read or write kanji obviously. What do you want me to do? It was done out of love and appreciation. What do you want me to say?\" she wrote on Twitter. \"There is a difference between appropriation and appreciation.\"\n\nLeung, Liu, Schuyler, Moan, and representatives for Grande didn't respond to Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Since the pop star filed a $10 million lawsuit against Forever 21 on Monday, she has been hit with accusations of hypocrisy and appropriation.", "authors": ["Callie Ahlgrim"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72d9df21214c793d6baa3e-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
