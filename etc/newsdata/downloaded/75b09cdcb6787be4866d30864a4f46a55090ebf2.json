Lisa Niven-Phillips reports and four women try out the latest looks\n\nA fashion season can be defined as much by the people on the catwalk as it can by the clothes they are wearing. This time around, a key moment came at the end of Marc Jacobs\u2019 New York show, when an almost makeup-free Christy Turlington made a rare return to the catwalk, aged 50 (she also stars, with the designer himself, in the label\u2019s AW ad campaign). While this is hardly ancient in the real world, it is in modelling, where the average catwalk model is around 18. A few days later, Simone Rocha arguably upped the ante. The 32-year-old\u2019s show \u2013 in part inspired by Louise Bourgeois, who lived until she was 98 \u2013 featured models in their 30s and 40s, including cult favourite Jeny Howorth and actor Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.\n\nOf course, the motives for this are not entirely pure. The over-50s account for around 47% of all UK consumer spending, according to figures from 2015, and if their financial clout has been dubbed the \u201cgrey pound\u201d by the retail world, it\u2019s an even more dazzling silver in beauty. In an arena where youth has always been highly prized, older faces are finally having a moment in the spotlight, or at least on a billboard near you. Unretouched, unairbrushed Helen Mirren, 74, tells us we\u2019re all worth it for L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris; Neal\u2019s Yard Remedies\u2019 #AgeWellRevolution stars \u201creal\u201d women of all demographics; and Pantene\u2019s #PowerOfGrey initiative challenges the discrepancy between perceptions of men and women with grey hair, encouraging women of all ages to share images of themselves on social media, using the hashtag #powerofgrey.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maggie Wright, 69, wears a top and scarf by Mulberry, jewellery by Jennifer Fisher and glasses by Alessandra Rich x Linda Farrow. Her hair was styled by Abra Kennedy using Maria Nila\n\nIn MAC\u2019s What\u2019s Your Thing campaign, models and non-models wear makeup looks that represent their unique style. Among them are Anna Klevhag, 50, sporting bold, berry-stained lips, and Jan de Villeneuve, 75, in full foundation, pillarbox-red lipstick and smoky eye makeup. Neither has been made to look younger; instead they look confident, stylish, modern \u2013 a woman in her 20s would be as inspired to buy that berry lipstick as one in her 50s. Feedback for the campaign has been overwhelmingly positive and thousands have shared their own #whatsyourthing posts on Instagram.\n\nCampaigns such as MAC\u2019s demonstrate a shift in attitudes. \u201cOlder women are usually forced into either rosy \u2018mother-of-the-bride\u2019 makeup or the New York-eccentric caricature of bug-eyed glasses and bright clothes,\u201d says MAC\u2019s Terry Barber. \u201cWhat people enjoy about this campaign is seeing older women who look very different from one another, are very stylish, and are not just there to tick the diversity box. Consumers are constantly offered \u2018fixes\u2019 or told how to hide wrinkles. But what if you don\u2019t want to hide them?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joan Williams, 60, wears a Chanel jacket and jewellery with gloves by Dents. Her hair was styled by Abra Kennedy using Maria Nila\n\nMillie Kendall, a makeup artist and CEO of the not-for-profit British Beauty Council, which represents the industry, says the culture of invisibility around older women is finally lifting. She points to fashion\u2019s embracing of grey hair and advancements in product innovation as proof. Turning 50 made her realise \u201chow invisible my ancestors must have felt \u2013 my great-aunts looked like cartoon old ladies at my age. I think the future will be less about age and more about your attitude to life and how you express yourself.\u201d\n\nThe language of beauty has also had an update. In 2017, US magazine Allure banned \u201canti-ageing\u201d from its pages and in 2018, a report by the Royal Society for Public Health called for an end to the term\u2019s use for UK cosmetics. Meanwhile, earlier this year, British Vogue released \u201cThe Non-Issue\u201d, a mini magazine focused on the over-50s, created with L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris. \u201cDiversity is intrinsic to all that [editor-in-chief] Edward Enninful does, so age representation is as important as skin tone, size and gender diversity,\u201d says Vogue beauty and lifestyle director Jessica Diner. \u201cHaving a project dedicated to the idea that age shouldn\u2019t be a factor in beauty felt important.\u201d\n\nHaving Jane Fonda, 81, on the cover generated a buzz. \u201cThis has really spoken to me. Loved it,\u201d read one of the 700-plus comments on Enninful\u2019s Instagram post of the cover. \u201cBeauty is truly ageless. I hope we see more of this in all aspects of the industry,\u201d read another.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fabia Khan, 56, wears a Louis Vuitton scarf\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris deserves credit for working with older celebrities long before anyone else, having signed Fonda in the mid-noughties and now boasting a \u201cgolden squad\u201d including Mirren and Julianne Moore, 58. \u201cWe celebrate women of all ages because women of all ages use and love our products,\u201d says Karen Flavard-Jones, UK general manager. \u201cWe know that women over 50 don\u2019t feel represented in advertising, and that the amount spent on beauty increases with age.\u201d\n\nBeauty advertising has traditionally focused on looking younger, rather than embracing beauty at any age. A Palmolive ad from the 30s even read, \u201cA wife can blame herself if she loses love by getting \u2018middle age\u2019 skin.\u201d While things have moved on, there are still issues. In 2017, Dior cast 25-year-old Cara Delevingne in its Capture Youth anti-ageing campaign, sparking a social media backlash, while in 1996, Lanc\u00f4me famously let Isabella Rossellini go at 43, only to rehire her at 63.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe in an anti-wrinkle cream if it\u2019s shown on a younger woman who is unlikely to have any,\u201d says Renia Jaz, 53, whose blog and Instagram account @venswifestyle are dedicated to ageless style. \u201cWe are not ashamed of the changes happening to our hair, face and body, and we want brands to respect that.\u201d\n\nA move towards intersectionality is the next step. Though we do now see older women in ads, almost all are white, a notable exception being 67-year-old JoAni Johnson, selected by Rihanna for her debut Fenty campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s time my demographic was reflected more broadly,\u201d Johnson said in an interview with Paper magazine. \u201cFashion doesn\u2019t have any age, gender or race limit, so why restrict it in the visuals?\u201d\n\nWhile the industry works towards meaningful representation, Kendall points to Instagram as the best place to see \u201creal\u201d women talking about beauty, citing journalist Nadine Baggott and skin expert Caroline Hirons as good examples. Others include 91-year-old Baddie Winkle, whose neon-hued makeup led to her creating her own collection for INC.redible cosmetics, and 69-year-old Suzi Grant, whose @alternativeageing account got her spotted for a role in a campaign for Revolution.\n\n\u201cThe image of a mature woman that has been in the consciousness of our society for many years is outdated. We want to be represented by women who are just like us, who are real,\u201d Jaz says. \u201cWomen over 50 are not unicorns. We are consumers and we know what we want.\u201d", "description": "With fiftysomethings on the catwalk, what\u2019s the impact on the traditionally youth orientated beauty industry?
