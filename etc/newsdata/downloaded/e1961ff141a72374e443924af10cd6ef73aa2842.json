Speaking to reporters Tuesday during Dominance MMA media day, Garbrandt said he hopes the UFC makes it\u2019s return to his home state of Ohio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping for March return, hopefully sooner,\u201d Garbrandt said. \u201cI talked to Dana a few days ago. I would like for the UFC to come back to Ohio in March. There\u2019s the Arnold Classic there. It\u2019s a great time to go and do that, so we\u2019ll see. We got Stipe (Miocic) as the champion again, so Stipe fighting in Ohio the home state, I would love to, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m at with that. I\u2019m excited to come back.\u201d\n\nGarbrandt (11-3 MMA, 6-3 UFC) had a fast rise in the UFC, capturing the bantamweight title in under two years by putting on a memorable performance vs. Dominick Cruz in December 2016.\n\nBut since then, he\u2019s dropped three in a row, which has forced \u201cNo Love\u201d to sit back and take some time off. However, the consistency of top talent and big names in the 135-pound division has made Garbrandt eager to return.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a little injury prone these last few fights and camps, but I\u2019m taking my time, and I just turned 28. I have a lot of life and fight in me,\u201d Garbrandt said. \u201cMy hunger is still \u2013 everyday I wake up excited to get back. My division is one of the most entertaining, best divisions in the UFC. You got Frankie coming down, you got Edgar, you got Marlon (Moraes), you got Henry (Cejudo), Dominick\u2019s (Cruz) making his comeback, you got T.J. \u2018Pillashaw,\u2019 he\u2019ll probably be back. You know he\u2019s taken his steroids, so it\u2019s a good division. Those are all good guys, so it keeps me excited.\u201d\n\nHaving fought four times in 2016, Garbrandt never really took the time to heal past injuries properly, which is why he\u2019s making sure to take the right amount of time to recover from the torn tendon he suffered in his wrist during training.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to rush this recovery process,\u201d Garbrandt said. \u201cI thought when I was younger, especially being the champion, I wanted to defend that as quickly and as much as I could, and four fights in one year, my body it came as a cost, and I was able to become a champion. I tasted it a little bit, and I\u2019m more hungry than I\u2019ve ever been. I have to go back up the mountain a different way, a different path, and I\u2019m excited for that.\u201d", "description": "Cody Garbrandt is itching to get back on track.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cody-garbrandt-dominance-media-day.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
