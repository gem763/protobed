The news was released amid House Democrats\u2019 investigation of allegations that Trump and Giuliani \u201csought to manipulate the Ukrainian government into helping the Trump reelection campaign.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Giuliani canceled a trip to Ukraine in which he was allegedly planning to pressure the government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. The elder Biden is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Trump during next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nGiuliani told Cuomo that it was a \u201cscandal of major proportions which all of you have covered up for five or six months.\u201d He also revived right-wing conspiracy theories about billionaire George Soros, claiming he was in on the \u201cmajor\u201d scandal with Biden.\n\nBut Giuliani first denied trying to encourage Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cDid you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?\u201d Cuomo asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he asked Ukraine to investigate if that country tried to help Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cYou never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden?\u201d Cuomo asked.\n\nGiuliani then admitted he asked Ukraine to look into a conspiracy theory related to Biden.\n\n\u201cSo you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\u201d Cuomo asked again.\n\n\u201cOf course I did!\u201d Giuliani said.\n\n\u201cYou just said you didn\u2019t!\u201d Cuomo said.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t ask them to look into Joe Biden,\u201d Giuliani replied.\n\nWatch the exchange below:\n\nCNN's @ChrisCuomo: \"Did you ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\"@RudyGiuliani: \"Of course I did\"\n\n\n\nPresident Trump's attorney says he had spoken with a Ukrainian official about Joe Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who investigated Biden's son. pic.twitter.com/hqmqtmx2VW \u2014 Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) September 20, 2019\n\nGiuliani: \"Some whistleblowers are liars\"@ChrisCuomo speaks with Pres.
