By the end of the 10 months, average daily drinking was down to 18 oz, a 48.5 decrease from day one.\n\nAnd the group that was given the talking to about the risks of soda consumption cut back even further, to just 9.6 oz a day on average.\n\n'Regardless of whether they were overweight or lean, most of the participants in the study tended to lose belly fat when they were offered a healthier beverage selection at work,' said Dr Epel.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the employees had slimmer waists by the end of the study period.\n\n\n\n'This was not a ban on the consumption of sugared beverages,' emphasized senior author Dr Laura Schmidt.\n\n'People could still bring them from home or buy them off campus. This study demonstrates the value in rigging workplace environments to support people's health rather than the opposite.\n\n'UCSF simply took sugary drinks out of workplace vending machines, break rooms and cafeterias, and wound up improving employees' health.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "After the University of California, San Francisco stopped selling sweetened beverages on campus in 2015, employees drank 50 percent less soda and the 70 percent of them lost belly fat in just 10 months.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20283344-0-image-a-3_1572278543599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
