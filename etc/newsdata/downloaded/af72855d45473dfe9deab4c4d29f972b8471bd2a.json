Here's some of the small print Boris Johnson didn't want you to read.\n\n1. There's still no plan to fix social care\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\nBoris Johnson has been accused of paying \"lip service\" to social care after the Queen's Speech didn't give a time limit or details of any reform.\n\nNotes to the Queen's Speech said: \"We will bring forward substantive proposals to fix the crisis\". But they gave no time limit, did not confirm the nature of any proposals, and did not propose a law in the current one-year Parliament.\n\nThey repeated an already-announced \u00a31.5bn cash injection. But \u00a3500m of that has to be raised by councils through a 2% rise in the council tax precept.\n\nJane Ashcroft, chief executive of Anchor Hanover, England\u2019s largest not-for-profit provider of care and housing for older people, said: \"It is exasperating to see government once again pay lip service to social care, and failing to meaningfully address the deepening crisis.\"\n\nKathryn Hill, Director of England at Carers Trust, said: \u201cCarers Trust is extremely concerned to hear the government is proposing only a partial commitment to reform.\"\n\nGenevieve Edwards, Director of External Affairs at the MS Society, said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly troubling that social care for working-age disabled people has been dismissed yet again.\"\n\nA No10 spokesman said the government had \"set out its commitment\" to reform social care to \"end the fear of people having to sell their homes to pay for care\". But he admitted: \"I can't set out a timeline now. We will be setting it out in due course.\"\n\n2. The Tories are trying to 'rig' the next election\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBoris Johnson is accused of using the Queen\u2019s Speech as a \u201cblatant\u201d attempt to \"rig\" the result of the next election after it slipped out a pledge to force voters to show ID.\n\nHer Majesty said: \"My Government will take steps to protect the integrity of democracy and the electoral system in the United Kingdom.\"\n\nBut the small print confirms this involves ramming ahead with a highly controversial ID scheme, despite concerns it will lock millions out of democracy.\n\nVoters will be forced to show \"an approved form of photographic ID\" in order to vote - despite there being just eight allegations of fraud at a polling station last year.\n\nFor comparison, a whopping 819 people were turned away in a recent trial in eight council areas.\n\nThe Electoral Reform Society today warned it could be another \"Windrush\" - the scandal that saw Brits who came from the Caribbean threatened with deportation.\n\n\u201cThese plans risk excluding huge numbers of marginalised voters \u2013 including many elderly and BAME voters \u2013 from our democratic processes and risk undermining free and fair elections,\" ERS director Dr Jess Garland said.\n\nNo10 launched a furious response. The Prime Minister's official spokesman claimed the absence of voter ID in Britain is a \u201csecurity risk\u201d and said voter ID has run in Northern Ireland since 2003 \u201cwithout any impact on the number of people who go and vote\u201d.\n\nBut asked if the government could point to any evidence of widespread voter fraud at the ballot box, the spokesman did not. And a No10 spokesman snapped: \"I\u2019m not sure politically we\u2019ll be taking messages about voter suppression from a party whose main mandate at the moment is to suppress the biggest vote in the democratic history of this country.\"\n\n3. Plans to end 'no-fault' evictions appear to have been shelved\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\nThe government has produced more than 120 pages of notes to the Queen's Speech. But it has no specific mention of housing, tenants or renting.\n\nAnd crucially, a pledge to end \"no-fault\" evictions - where landlords ditch tenants at short notice without good reason - does not appear in the speech at all.\n\nWhen the axe to no-fault evictions was announced under Theresa May in April, the government claimed it would be the \"biggest change to the private rental sector for a generation\".\n\nYet despite a consultation closing on Friday, there's not even lip service paid to it in the government's notes. That means there's almost zero chance of a legal change in the next year.\n\nA No10 spokesman later insisted the plans had not been dropped altogether. He said: \u201cWe absolutely do intend to abolish no fault evictions and will bring forward the appropriate legislation in due course.\u201d\n\nBut Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to see the housing emergency missing from the government\u2019s agenda in the face of the current crisis. With more than 300,000 people homeless and millions fighting for a stable home, this is not something it can ignore.\"\n\n4. Action to keep kids safe online isn't here yet...\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\nMinisters had pledged to improve internet safety for children and vulnerable people. But there's no Bill announced yet in today's Queen's Speech - which means a law would be unlikely to come forward in the next year.\n\nLast month, ministers pledged they \"will establish in law\" a new duty of care making web giants responsible for their users.\n\nYet today, the notes say only: \u201cMy Ministers will continue to develop proposals to improve internet safety.\"\n\nAndy Burrows, NSPCC Head of Child Safety Online, said: \u201cChild abuse on the Wild West Web must stop.\n\n\"The Government\u2019s commitment to online harms is positive, but it is crucial it treats children\u2019s safety as a matter of urgency. Boris Johnson must stick to previous commitments and introduce an Online Harms Bill in this session.\"\n\n5... Nor is action for people in a mental health crisis...\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\nThere will be a White Paper \"by the end of this year\" setting out the government's response to possible reforms to the Mental Health Act.\n\nIt comes after pleas for patients not to be detained \"any more than is absolutely necessary\" and ensure their views are respected. However there are no immediate plans for a new law in the coming Parliament - as it's not one of the 22 Bills in the Queen's Speech.\n\nSophie Corlett of Mind, the mental health charity, said: \"The urgency of reviewing the Mental Health Act cannot be overstated.\n\n\"Increasing numbers of people being sectioned under the Act are enduring substandard treatment due to poor conditions, lack of choice, loss of dignity and even racial discrimination. This can\u2019t go on.\n\n\u201cIt is almost a year since the Independent Review of the Mental Health Act was published and we now need to see action.\"\n\n6... Or criminal sanctions for Grenfell-style building owners\n\n(Image: Chris J Ratcliffe)\n\nThe speech documents talk of a \"fundamental change\" in the regulations on high-rise tower blocks to ensure \"accountability and responsibility\" from their owners.\n\nOver the weekend there was talk of this leading to criminal sanctions.\n\nBut there is no mention in the Queen's Speech documents of criminal sanctions.\n\nAnd the crackdown is only planned for some time in the future - it is not one of the 22 firm laws announced today in the Queen's Speech.\n\n7. There's still no date for a reform of restaurant workers' tips\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\nRestaurants will be forced to hand over all tips to staff - more than three years after the Tories first promised to crack down on the loophole.\n\nBut there's no date in the Queen's Speech, or its notes, for when the Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill might come into force.\n\nAnd it's not thought to be among more than half a dozen Bills which are being rushed forward to Parliament this week.\n\nIts inclusion in the Queen's Speech suggests the law would be passed in the next year. But that's not the same as it coming into force. A No10 spokesman was unable to give a firm date.\n\nAnd finally... Education funding isn't as big as the Tories claim\n\nDowning Street tweeted today: \"We\u2019re giving a \u00a314billion cash boost to schools across the UK.\"\n\nBut the notes to the Queen's Speech show that's not the whole story.\n\nThose notes say the Tories are \"investing a total of \u00a314billion more over three years\".\n\nSo even by their own account, the core schools budget will be \u00a37.1billion higher in 2022-23 compared to this year. Still a big number, but not quite what it seemed.", "description": "Boris Johnson tried to use today's Queen's Speech as a Tory election broadcast.
