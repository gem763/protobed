I have covered the humanitarian consequences of war for three decades, but the sheer horror I witnessed during this conflict felt different.\n\nThere was no end to the cruelty. The stream of suicide bombs, grenades, car bombs, and snipers was relentless. People were forced to watch their loved ones die in front of them. And when civilians did reach the point of escape, Isis would use them as human shields.\n\nBut what really ripped at my heart was the plight of Isis children whose parents had been suicide bombers for the caliphate. I met one little girl called Khadija who was calling out for her mother, not realising that the burns all over her body were caused by her mother\u2019s suicide bomb. As a mother, I will never understand an ideology that would induce you to hurt your own.\n\nThe photo was taken near the ruins of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Isis first proclaimed the caliphate in 2014. It was like Armageddon: buildings were smoking, bombs were dropping and there was sniper fire from all angles. When people fled, they were first checked for suicide bombs by Iraqi soldiers, men had to remove their shirts, and their names were checked for recorded Isis affiliation. Then they moved on to the trauma stabilisation point for emergency medical care, which was where I spent most of my time taking photographs.\n\nThis little girl had fled with a group of women and children. She paused here momentarily. My fixer had gone missing so I couldn\u2019t speak to her but I knew I had to take the shot. It was the picture of innocence amid war, a tragic juxtaposition of this tiny girl who should have been enjoying her childhood trapped in the middle of this catastrophic battle.\n\nHope is something I always look for, even amid the worst devastation and despair. I didn\u2019t see much of it in Mosul\n\nShe only stayed briefly. She looked to me as though she was in shock and she rejoined the group of women and children only a few moments later. This piece of rubble was the only place she could rest.\n\nI wanted my work in Mosul to help viewers to see these people as individuals. It\u2019s really hard when you talk about war and statistics and the numbers dying to remember the humanity behind the numbers. But when you focus on individual faces, or a little girl sitting in debris with her head in her hands, it touches people on a universal emotional level, and gives viewers the possibility to connect. That\u2019s always been my goal.\n\nIsis may have been defeated, but the ideology has not been eradicated. Some of the children I met already knew the meaning of martyrdom because their parents indoctrinated them from birth. I don\u2019t know what happens to those kids.\n\nHope is something I always look for, even within the worst devastation and despair. I didn\u2019t see much of it in Mosul. Perhaps the closest thing came from the medics. They saved countless lives, and I know they were frustrated \u2013 the Iraqi government would not let them any nearer to the frontline, so they were forced to watch people die who they probably could have saved had they had just a couple more minutes. To me, they were angels amid the misery.\n\nPhotojournalism is never about us, we\u2019re just the link to the narratives of others. You have to feel something when you see things like this, but empathy can be as much of a curse as it is a blessing. I have always tried to be open about the trauma I\u2019ve experienced, the PTSD, the meltdowns, but I think the thing that saves my sanity is my understanding that what I have experienced is nothing compared with what the people in my pictures have lived through.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Empathy can be as much of a curse as a blessing\u2019 \u2026 Carol Guzy.
