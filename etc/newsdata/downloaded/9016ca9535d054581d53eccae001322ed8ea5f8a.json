But it\u2019s not enough to encourage responsibility among adults; we have to teach children how money works early on.\n\nFinancial literacy has been on the national curriculum for five years, but we still have a long way to go. Lessons still focus on physical cash rather than on cashless alternatives. There would be an outcry if children were taught to use typewriters rather than computers in IT classes, so why are we allowing the same to happen with money?\n\nTo make matters worse \u2013 and without dismissing many teachers\u2019 fantastic efforts \u2013 financial literacy is often squeezed out of crammed timetables. And when lessons do take place, it seems they are often taught in a dry, academic style that has nothing to do with the experience of money beyond the school gates.\n\nIn a world where money can be spent more easily than ever, failing to teach children how to handle it properly is, frankly, dangerous.\n\nClint Wilson\n\nFounder, nimbl\n\nBe careful what you vote for\n\nOn the BBC this morning, Tony Blair likened referenda to a sort of \u201cretail politics\u201d, similar to the sort of pronouncements made during election campaigns that invite binary responses. However, when governments attempt to put the resulting policies into action, the results are rarely as simple as initially proposed. This is the reason we have a Parliamentary Democracy and not one governed by referenda.\n\nAn example would be if we were to hold a referendum on proposing Income Tax Cuts For All. It would, I suspect, attract a large majority in favour; however, when looking at such a proposal in detail, it becomes clear that under such a scheme, the rich would benefit more than the poor, and the reduced tax take could seriously affect funding for health and education, which could outweigh any benefit from reduced income taxes. For this reason we should not be implementing the result of our Brexit referendum without any regard to the consequences.\n\nGeoff Forward\n\nStirling\n\nA step too far\n\nI\u2019m a firm Remainer in a Tory constituency. Labour never does well here. Many Brexit voters would probably call me an anti-democratic, middle-class \u201cenemy of the people\u201d because I badly want a second EU referendum.\n\nBut when a general election comes, if I find myself voting Lib Dem, it will be with a heavy heart. It\u2019s obvious that to revoke Article 50 without seeking public opinion (as they say they will \u201con day one\u201d if they win a parliamentary majority) is even more undemocratic than the flawed referendum of 2016. It will do nothing to heal this country\u2019s massive divisions.\n\nAt least a Remain outcome from a People\u2019s Vote could legitimately be called the will of the people.\n\nPatrick Cosgrove\n\nShropshire\n\nAcross the Irish sea\n\nThe Department of Transport is 100 per cent right to be conducting a study into a fixed link to join Belfast to the United Kingdom mainland. Post-Brexit, expanding our infrastructure will be a matter of urgency to reassure and encourage inward investors \u2013 and indeed to sustain the United Kingdom.\n\nThat means HS2 needs to be extended not just to Glasgow and Edinburgh but to Belfast. That would be a boon for rail freight, as goods would be loaded onto freight trains at Belfast bound direct for continental Europe. The port of Belfast would also increase in strategic importance in terms of transatlantic trade.\n\nJohn Barstow\n\nWest Sussex\n\nWhat good old days?\n\nCharlotte Cripps sweetly confides that she doesn\u2019t \u201chave the money to send her [child] to Queen\u2019s Gate, in South Kensington, a fee-paying school where my parents sent me, in the days before fee-paying education had become so elitist\u201d. When, exactly, were those days? I only ask because, at my age and having only been state-educated, I can be so forgetful and worry I may have missed a century or several.\n\nBeryl Wall\n\nLondon", "description": "Madeline\u00a0Palacz\u2019s\u00a0article\u00a0\u201cBen Stokes deserves our sympathy, but The Sun had every right to run their story\u201d glosses over a number of important details in its defence of\u00a0The Sun\u2019s decision to publish personal and sensitive details relating to Ben Stokes\u2019s family background.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/29/13/Ben-Stokes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
