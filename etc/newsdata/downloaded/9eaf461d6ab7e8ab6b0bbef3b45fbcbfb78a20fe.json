UPDATE 4-UK retailer M&S slips on FTSE 100 eviction expectations\n\n* M&S has been FTSE 100 member since index created in 1984\n\n* Company has struggled with tough competition\n\n* Final results of quarterly FTSE 100 reshuffle due\n\nWednesday\n\n* Micro Focus , Direct Line also on the cards for demotion\n\n* Polymetal , Hikma, Meggitt likely replacements\n\n\n\n(Adds details from FTSE press release, investor comments)\n\nBy Josephine Mason\n\nLONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Marks & Spencer shares\n\nfell on Monday on expectations the 135-year old retailer will be\n\nrelegated from London's FTSE 100 index blue-chip stock\n\nmarket for the first time and a \"sell\" rating from Goldman\n\nSachs.\n\nRemoval from the blue chip index in its quarterly review\n\nwould be another blow for Archie Norman, who became M&S chairman\n\ntwo years ago to work alongside Steve Rowe, who was named CEO in\n\n2016 and has been with the company for three decades.\n\nLosing FTSE 100 membership would mean M&S shares could no\n\nlonger be held by investment funds that only track the index of\n\nBritain's top companies, forcing them to dump the stock.\n\nM&S shares, which have been part of the FTSE 100 since it\n\nstarted in 1984, have lost about 40% of their value since\n\nJanuary 2018 as the British high street stalwart has struggled\n\nwith competition in clothing and food, particularly online.\n\nAt Monday's close, the shares were down 1.4%, lagging the\n\nFTSE 100 index, which closed 1% higher.\n\nGoldman Sachs reinstated its coverage of the stock with a\n\n'sell' rating on M&S, which embarked on a major turnaround plan\n\nas fast-fashion chains such as Zara and H&M that have eroded\n\nprofit in its clothing business. FTSE Russell, London Stock Exchange-owned index provider,\n\nsaid Direct Line , Marks & Spencer and Micro Focus\n\nare likely to be removed from the blue-chip index based\n\non Friday's closing prices.\n\nWhile, precious metals mining firm Polymetal ,\n\ngeneric drugmaker Hikma and aerospace and defence group\n\nMeggitt are the likely replacements. Polymetal, Hikma\n\nand Meggitt have all been in the top 100 index before.\n\nThe final FTSE 100 review will be based on closing prices on\n\nTuesday, with the results announced after the end of trading on\n\nWednesday and going into effect on Sept. 23.\n\nValued at 3.76 billion pounds ($4.6 billion), M&S is ranked\n\n112th in the FTSE 350 of large and mid-cap companies based on\n\nFriday's market capitalisation, a position which would mean\n\nautomatic eviction from the FTSE 100.\n\nIn order to avoid constant changes to the index as a result\n\nof day-to-day price volatility, companies are only demoted when\n\nthey drop below 110 in the ranking.\n\n\n\nBut the ousting of a British household name has caught\n\ninvestors' attention.\n\nAdrian Lowcock, head of personal investing, Willis Owen said\n\nit was a sign of the times.\n\n\"High Street retailers have been struggling for some time\n\nand M&S continues to look for that balance between quality and\n\nprice,\" he said.\n\n\"The wider list at risk of dropping out, if not this time\n\naround possibly next \u2013 which includes ITV, Kingfisher,\n\nSainsbury's and WM Morrison Supermarkets - shows how markets\n\nevolve and trends change.\"\n\nM&S is only one of just 28 original members still in the\n\nFTSE and one of only 16 with the same name, highlighting how\n\nhard it is to stay at the top for long, A&J Bell investment\n\ndirector Russ Mould said.\n\n\"In a way a spell out of the spotlight may well do it some\n\ngood and based on the performance of previous companies that\n\nhave fallen out of the UK benchmark it hasn't been too long\n\nbefore they have returned,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market\n\nanalyst at CMC Markets UK.\n\nThe shares trade at a hefty discount to their retail peers\n\nand the broader stock market.\n\n($1 = 0.8145 pounds)\n\n\n\nM&S market cap https://tmsnrt.rs/2kaQI8F\n\nM&S valuation https://tmsnrt.rs/2kerIgP\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 4-UK retailer M&S slips on FTSE 100 eviction expectations", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0L0PD_L.jpg"}
