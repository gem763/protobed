The Mitchells, who are uncle and nephew, have both been arrested but Mr Green has not been caught.\n\nPolice said Jacquerious had told officers Brown shot him in the chest after a fight broke out during the drug deal. Mr Green is then said to have shot Brown twice and fled with his backpack and gun.\n\nJacquerious remains in hospital in a critical condition, Mr Moore told the press conference.\n\nPolice said they had confiscated 5.4kg of cannabis, 149g of THC cartridges and more than $4,000 (\u00a33,300) in cash during a search of Brown\u2019s home.\n\nIt is unclear how the three suspects came into contact with Brown or why they would have driven more than 300 miles from central Louisiana to purchase cannabis in Texas.\n\nThe police press conference came amid rampant speculation over Brown\u2019s death. His shooting followed a jury sentencing Guyger, who is white, to 10 years in prison for killing her black neighbour in a case that sparked fierce debate over race, politics and policing.\n\nGuyger told her trial she had shot Botham Jean in his fourth-floor flat in September 2018 after mistaking it for her own in the floor before. She was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, a charge critics said was too lenient, but a grand jury later decided on the more serious offence of murder.\n\nBrown, who was black and lived on the same floor as Jean, was one of several neighbours called by prosecutors to testify at the trial.\n\nHe told the court that on the night Jean was killed he heard what sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise\u201d and then two gunshots.\n\nJoshua Brown gives evidence at Amber Guyger\u2019s murder trial (AP) More\n\nThe NAACP Legal Defence and Educational Fund, which campaigns for racial justice, said Brown\u2019s testimony had been \u201ccritical to officer Guyger\u2019s conviction\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow, the deeply alarming and highly suspicious murder of Joshua Brown increases the urgency of an immediate, independent investigation of every aspect of these two tragic killings,\u201d it added.\n\nLee Merritt, a lawyer acting for the families of both Brown and Jean, said he had \u201cno reason to believe [Dallas police\u2019s] conclusions so far in the investigation are unreliable\u201d but \u201csome members of the community will have a difficult time accepting it\u201d because of the force\u2019s association with the Guyger trial.\n\nHe urged the police department to hand the investigation into Brown\u2019s death to another law enforcement agency as a way to bolster trust.", "description": "Detectives investigating the killing of a witness in a former Dallas police officer\u2019s murder trial have insisted his death had nothing to do with the case.Dallas Police Department said three Louisiana men were suspected of gunning down Joshua Brown, 28, after allegedly travelling to the Texas city to", "authors": ["Chris Baynes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e2ifSR5rjFS9uSdFRe5rlQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/80325ee6becb55061cc37bfc2e8fc165", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
