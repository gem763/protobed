Trump has denied their allegations.\n\nVance is probing whether the Trump Organization falsified business records related to payoffs.\n\nIt is not clear if the DA has obtained any of the tax returns he is seeking from Mazars, or whether Vance is now investigating issues beyond the hush money payments.\n\nTrump has refused to publicly release his tax returns despite a long-standing practice by past presidents who did so.\n\nThe New York Times first reported the news of the subpoena. A person with direct knowledge of the matter soon after confirmed the subpoena was issued to NBC News.\n\nMarc Mukasey, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, in an email to CNBC, said, \"We are evaluating and will respond as appropriate.\"\n\nMazars USA, in an emailed statement, said, \"Mazars USA will respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.\"\n\n\"We believe strongly in the ethical and professional rules and regulations that govern our industry, our work and our client interactions. As a matter of firm policy and professional rules we do not comment on the work we conduct for our clients,\" the firm said.", "description": "The subpoeana from Manhattan District Attorney's Cyrus Vance Jr.'s , for President Donald Trump's tax returns, was issued last month to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106124788-1568235708066rts2q6zs.jpg?v=1568235786", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
