Elizabeth Warren is the latest Democrat to argue an arcane Senate rule governing debate stands in the way of passing a progressive agenda, such as meaningful gun control.\n\nThe procedure, known as the filibuster, allows a 41-vote minority in the Senate to block legislation. Its power has been steadily eroding, however, as both Democratic and Republican lawmakers create procedures to get around the roadblock to pass everything from the Affordable Care Act to President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees.\n\nShould the Senate move even farther toward being a legislative body characterized by majority rule rather than minority obstruction?\n\nMany Democrats, including me, might resist anything that helps Trump and his GOP Senate majority pass their agenda. Yet as a scholar of the Senate and advocate of responsible government, I believe the end of the 60-vote Senate would nonetheless be a good thing for the country \u2014 and conform to the founders\u2019 intentions.\n\nThe filibuster explained\n\nThe filibuster, which comes from the Dutch word for pirate, is embodied in Senate Rule XXII. It says cloture \u2014 a motion to end debate on a bill \u2014 requires a supermajority of at least 60 votes on most matters under consideration.\n\nAlthough some lawmakers argue the filibuster is what makes the Senate unique, a supermajority threshold is not what defines the legislative chamber.\n\nAs political scientists and historians have noted over and over again, supermajority cloture is not part of \u2014 and cannot be derived from \u2014 the Constitution or any original understanding of the Senate. Elements such as equal representation by the states, six-year terms and a higher age requirement are what distinguish the Senate\u2019s style of deliberation and decision-making from the House.\n\nIn fact, although it may seem like the 60-vote filibuster has been with us forever, it\u2019s actually only been around since 1917.\n\nMoreover, the protection of the minority, often cited as a justification for the filibuster, is of the system as a whole: the separate branches, the checks, federalism. It\u2019s not the role of the Senate alone to protect minority interests.\n\nFilibuster erosion\n\nOver several decades, Congress has used dozens of legislative \u201ccarve-outs\u201d that have eroded the filibuster and protected specific categories of legislation from minority obstruction in the Senate.\n\nFor example, lawmakers use a \u201cfast-track\u201d procedure to pass trade agreements and decide whether to close military bases. This places a time limit on consideration and quashes minority obstruction in the Senate because a simple majority vote will be held at the end of the time restriction.\n\nIncreased use of budget reconciliation for major legislation is another carve-out. The Affordable Care Act, efforts to repeal that law and the 2017 Trump tax cut are examples of this process.\n\nIn 2013, Democrats controlling the Senate took it a step farther and voted to allow all nominations other than for the Supreme Court to be approved by majority vote. This was the most important change in Senate standing rules \u2014 or, to be precise, in their interpretation \u2014 since at least 1975. It allowed Democrats to confirm a significant number of nominations for President Barack Obama who were being blocked by the Republican minority.\n\nJust over three years later, the Senate, now under GOP control, voted to apply the same interpretation to nominations to the Supreme Court. The immediate result, of course, was the slim confirmations of Neil Gorsuch and later Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nRestoring the Senate\u2019s important but limited role\n\nToday, the 60-vote Senate remains powerful but circumscribed.\n\nThis threshold for ending debate still applies to most legislation, including appropriations bills and most laws in areas such as military policy, the environment or civil rights. And for Democrats hoping to occupy the White House in 2020, the need of a supermajority would likely prevent action on gun control, a Green New Deal and significant health-care legislation like \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\nBut by creating the various restrictions on its use in recent years, the Senate has repeatedly recognized that the 60-vote threshold is often dysfunctional and that the costs to effective governance are too high. The norms that support the supermajority Senate are eroding.\n\nIt\u2019s also contributed to broader congressional dysfunction. The Senate behaves less and less like the world\u2019s \u201cgreatest deliberative body\u201d \u2014 as some like to believe \u2014 and more like the least deliberative, particularly under the leadership of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Senate rarely debates, and McConnell \u2014 in his self-styled role as the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t allow amendments or legislation that he or the president disagrees with to come up for a vote, regardless of how much support it has in the chamber.\n\nI believe the Senate should change its rules to allow a simple majority to close debate on any bill, nomination or other matter, while also guaranteeing a minimum period of debate for any piece of legislation, which would allow the minority position to be voiced and debated.\n\nIn so doing, the Senate would end its undemocratic pretensions and resume its prescribed and limited role in the system of checks and balances. That would be a good thing no matter which party controls the Senate and regardless of who is, or will be, president.\n\nDaniel Wirls is professor of politics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
