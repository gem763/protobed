And while it was ugly on offense, likely in great part due to the lack of action so many regulars on that side of the ball got in the preseason, it was a thing of beauty for the defenders in green, gold and white. On this night, the Packers were the Monsters of the Midway.\n\n\u201cI think we woke a lot of people up,\u201d defensive end Montravius Adams said. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t believe in us. They had us ranked low, but we don\u2019t care about that outside noise.\u201d\n\nThere was plenty of noise heading into Soldier Field about Chicago\u2019s D, which was dominant in 2018 as the Bears won the NFC North. And it played quite well against Aaron Rodgers and the Pack, sacking Rodgers five times and yielding only 213 yards.\n\nBut the Packers were stingier.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was fun to watch,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen a performance like that. Obviously, a lot of credit to Mike Pettine and his staff, but to those players, just incredible.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do them a whole lot of favors with our performance on offense. I mean every time we needed something, a stop, they came up with some really big plays.\u201d\n\nIncluding five sacks of their own on a clearly befuddled Mitchell Trubisky. Plus the only turnover of the game, a fourth-quarter pick in the end zone by former Bears safety Adrian Amos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sweet. It really is,\u201d Rodgers added. \u201cI hold myself to a high standard and I didn\u2019t play great tonight, but to watch a defense like that, man, that gives you a lot of confidence about where this team can go.\u201d\n\nGreen Bay went into the end zone on an 8-yard jump ball reception by tight end Jimmy Graham - a former college basketball player who boxed out to perfection on the play. That was the difference, thanks to the stingy Packers D.\n\n\u201cBefore we started, we came together as a team, I told everybody, \u2018Let\u2019s shock the world on three,\u2019\u201d said linebacker Za\u2019Darius Smith, a free agency addition. \u201cAnd I felt like we did that tonight.\u201d\n\nThe game also was marked by sloppy offense and penalties. But the Packers made the fewest mistakes and now lead the league\u2019s longest series 98-95-6. Green Bay has won 16 of the last 19 regular-season meetings, and Rodgers is 17-5.\n\nChicago\u2019s defense hardly slacked, getting five sacks - tying the most it has had against Rodgers. But it could do little with the ball and Trubisky never found his stride. He even was sacked on Chicago\u2019s final offensive play.\n\n\u201cI think it was just sloppy by myself and as an offense as a whole,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cJust going through all our procedures, it was just tough. We couldn\u2019t find a rhythm.\u201d\n\nKICKING GAME\n\nMason Crosby made a 39-yard field goal in the final period for Green Bay, while Chicago got a 38-yarder from Eddy Pineiro. Bears fans rejoiced in relief on the first score of the season: Pineiro\u2019s first-quarter field goal. The last such kick on Soldier Field was Cody Parkey\u2019s double-doink off the goalpost and crossbar that sent Chicago home from the wild-card round. Pineiro, a second-year player from Florida, was an immediate hero in the Windy City.\n\nFLAGS\n\nEach team had 10 penalties, there was a total of 467 yards of only offense, and several drops. At one point, Chicago had three straight penalties to put it in a first-and-40. No, the Bears didn\u2019t convert.\n\nNew Packers coach Matt LaFleur made an ill-advised challenge, claiming offensive pass interference on a catch by Chicago\u2019s Taylor Gabriel. He lost in the first such challenge in NFL history after interference calls were added to replay reviews this season.\n\nINEPT, THEN IN FRONT\n\nThe opening series couldn\u2019t have been uglier for Green Bay. A run and a pass netted zero yards, then Rodgers was sacked heavily by Roy Robertson-Harris for a 10-yard loss.\n\nWell, maybe it could. Rodgers was sacked again on the next three-and-out and Chicago took over at the Packers 36 after a punt. Chicago had forced 17 yards in losses on those series, and the Packers had minus-12 yards through one period.\n\nRodgers erased such ineffectiveness quickly at the start of the second quarter, launching a 47-yard completion to Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Two more completions got the Pack to the 8, and Graham then scored.\n\nBy halftime, Green Bay had outgained Chicago 119 yards to 98.\n\nTHIRD-DOWN FAILURES\n\nChicago was a pitiful 3 for 15 on third downs and 0 for 2 on fourth downs. Green Bay was even worse trying to convert, going 2 for 12 on third downs.\n\n\u201cI am not in panic mode,\u201d Nagy said.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nPackers: Host Minnesota on Sept. 15.\n\nBears: At Denver on Sept. 15.\n\n____\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "To open its celebration of its 100th season, the NFL got a throwback to, well, the 1920s.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/packers_bears_football_99183_c0-349-4804-3149_s1770x1032.jpg?050fc1572e4e0d759be4b015c99044f4e00c52c4", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
