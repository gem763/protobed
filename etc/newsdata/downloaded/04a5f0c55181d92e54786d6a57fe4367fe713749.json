Donald Trump was talking about relaxing sanctions on Iran and holding a summit with its president, Hassan Rouhani, at this month\u2019s UN general assembly in New York. John Bolton, his hawkish national security adviser, was dead against it and forcefully rejected Trump\u2019s ideas during a tense meeting in the Oval Office on Monday.\n\nBig mistake. Still angry over the humiliating collapse of his secret Camp David weekend summit with the Afghan Taliban, which Bolton had also opposed, Trump was in no mood to listen to his aide\u2019s notoriously hardline views. \u201cI disagreed strongly with him,\u201d he said later. Trump lost his temper \u2013 and Bolton lost his job, summarily dismissed by tweet.\n\nBolton\u2019s brutal defenestration has raised hopes that Trump, who worries that voters may view him as a warmonger, may begin to moderate some of his more confrontational international policies. As the 2020 election looms, he is desperate for a big foreign policy peace-making success. And, in Trump world, winning matters more than ideology, principles or personnel.\n\nThe US president is now saying he is also open to a repeat meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to reboot stalled nuclear disarmament talks. On another front, he has offered an olive branch to China, delaying a planned tariff increase on $250bn of Chinese goods pending renewed trade negotiations next month. Meanwhile, he says, new tariffs on European car imports could be dropped, too.\n\nIs a genuine dove-ish shift under way? It seems improbable. Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has not merely broken with diplomatic and geopolitical convention. He has taken a wrecking ball to venerated alliances, multilateral cooperation and the postwar international rules-based order. He has cosied up to autocrats, attacked old friends and blundered into sensitive conflicts he does not fully comprehend.\n\nThe resulting new world disorder \u2013 to adapt George HW Bush\u2019s famous 1991 phrase \u2013 will be hard to put right. Like its creator, Trump world is unstable, unpredictable and threatening. Trump has been called America\u2019s first rogue president. Whether or not he wins a second term, this Trumpian era of epic disruption, the very worst form of American exceptionalism, is already deeply entrenched.\n\nThe suggestion that Trump will make nice and back off as election time nears thus elicits considerable scepticism. US analysts and commentators say the president\u2019s erratic, impulsive and egotistic personality means any shift towards conciliation may be short-lived and could quickly be reversed, Bolton or no Bolton.\n\nTrump wanted quick 'n' easy, primetime credit for a dramatic peace deal in Afghanistan with the Taliban, pushed ahead blindly, then changed his mind at the last minute\n\nTrump is notorious for blowing hot and cold, performing policy zigzags and suddenly changing his mind. \u201cRegardless of who has advised Mr Trump on foreign affairs \u2026 all have proved powerless before [his] zest for chaos,\u201d the New York Times noted last week.\n\nLacking experienced diplomatic and military advisers (he has sacked most of the good ones), surrounded by an inner circle of cynical sycophants such as secretary of state Mike Pompeo, and driven by a chronic desire for re-election, Trump\u2019s behaviour could become more, not less, confrontational during his remaining time in office, suggested Eliot Cohen, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins university.\n\n\u201cThe president has proved himself to be what many critics have long accused him of being: belligerent, bullying, impatient, irresponsible, intellectually lazy, short-tempered and self-obsessed,\u201d Cohen wrote in Foreign Affairs journal. \u201cRemarkably, however, those shortcomings have not yet translated into obvious disaster. But [that] \u2026 should not distract from a building crisis of US foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThis pending crisis stems from Trump\u2019s crudely Manichaean division of the world into two camps: adversaries/competitors and supporters/customers. A man with few close confidants, Trump has real trouble distinguishing between allies and enemies, friends and foes, and often confuses the two. In Trump world, old rules don\u2019t apply. Alliances are optional. Loyalty is weakness. And trust is fungible.\n\nAs a result, the US today finds itself at odds with much of the world to an unprecedented and dangerous degree. America, the postwar global saviour, has been widely recast as villain. Nor is this a passing phase. Trump seems to have permanently changed the way the US views the world and vice versa. Whatever follows, it will never be quite the same again.\n\nClues as to what he does next may be found in what he has done so far. His is a truly calamitous record, as exemplified by Afghanistan. Having vowed in 2016 to end America\u2019s longest war, he began with a troop surge, lost interest and sued for peace. A withdrawal deal proved elusive. Meanwhile, US-led forces inflicted record civilian casualties.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The US and Israeli flags are projected on the walls of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City in May, marking the anniversary of the US embassy transfer from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/Getty\n\nThe crunch came last weekend when a bizarre, secret summit with Taliban chiefs at Camp David was cancelled. It was classic Trump. He wanted quick \u2019n\u2019 easy, primetime credit for a dramatic peace deal, pushed ahead blindly, then changed his mind at the last minute. Furious over a debacle of his own making, he turned his wrath on others, notably Bolton \u2013 who, ironically, had opposed the summit all along.\n\nAll sides are now vowing to step up the violence, with the insurgents aiming to disrupt this month\u2019s presidential election in Afghanistan. In short, Trump\u2019s self-glorifying Afghan reality show, of which he was the Nobel-winning star, has made matters worse. Much the same is true of his North Korea summitry, where expectations were raised, then dashed when he got cold feet in Hanoi, provoking a backlash from Pyongyang.\n\nThe current crisis over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is almost entirely of Trump\u2019s making, sparked by his decision last year to renege on the 2015 UN-endorsed deal with Tehran. His subsequent \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of punitive sanctions has failed to cow Iranians while alienating European allies. And it has led Iran to resume banned nuclear activities \u2013 a seriously counterproductive, entirely predictable outcome.\n\nTrump\u2019s unconditional, unthinking support for Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s aggressively rightwing prime minister \u2013 including tacit US backing for his proposed annexation of swathes of the occupied territories \u2013 is pushing the Palestinians back to the brink, energising Hamas and Hezbollah, and raising tensions across the region.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s blessing, Israel is enmeshed in escalating, multi-fronted armed confrontation with Iran and its allies in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. Add to this recent violence in the Gulf, the disastrous Trump-backed, Saudi-led war in Yemen, mayhem in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, border friction with Turkey, and Islamic State resurgence in northern Iraq, and a region-wide explosion looks ever more likely.\n\nThe bipartisan consensus forged in the 1990s \u2013 in which the US towered over the world and, at low cost, sought to remake it in America's image \u2013 has failed and cannot be revived Stephen Wertheim, historian\n\nYet Trump, oblivious to the point of recklessness, remains determined to unveil his absurdly unbalanced Israel-Palestine \u201cdeal of the century\u201d after Tuesday\u2019s Israeli elections. He and his gormless son-in-law, Jared Kushner, may be the only people who don\u2019t realise their plan has a shorter life expectancy than a snowball on a hot day in Gaza.\n\nAnother prominent aspect of Trump world is his sinister, personal alliance with Vladimir Putin. There\u2019s no doubt Russia\u2019s president meddled in the 2016 US election to Trump\u2019s benefit, as the Mueller report states. There\u2019s no doubt Trump has gone easy on Putin over Crimea and Ukraine, over war crimes and chemical weapons attacks in Syria, over the Salisbury poisonings, and over his vicious assaults on Russia\u2019s democratic opposition. Trump is even pushing for Russia to be readmitted to the G7. Exactly why he acts this way is much less certain.\n\nWhether Trump is attacking Nato, insulting Europe\u2019s elected leaders, unhelpfully taking sides on Brexit, ignoring India\u2019s repression in Kashmir, plotting regime change in Venezuela, ignoring egregious human rights abuses from the Philippines to Saudi Arabia, undermining the UN and international law, wrecking nuclear arms control treaties, plundering the Arctic, or opposing efforts to combat climate crisis and environmental degradation, he is consistently out of line, out on his own \u2013 and out of control.\n\nThis, broadly, is Trump world as it has come to exist since January 2017. And this, in a nutshell, is the intensifying foreign policy crisis of which Professor Cohen warned. The days when responsible, trustworthy, principled US international leadership could be taken for granted are gone. No vague change of tone on North Korea or Iran will by itself halt the Trump-led slide into expanding global conflict and division.\n\nHistorians such as Stephen Wertheim say change had to come. US politicians of left and right mostly agreed that \u201cthe bipartisan consensus forged in the 1990s \u2013 in which the US towered over the world and, at low cost, sought to remake it in America\u2019s image \u2013 has failed and cannot be revived\u201d, Wertheim wrote earlier this year. \u201cBut agreement ends there \u2026 \u201d he continued: \u201cOne camp holds that the US erred by coddling China and Russia, and urges a new competition against these great power rivals. The other camp, which says the US has been too belligerent and ambitious around the world, counsels restraint, not another crusade against grand enemies.\u201d\n\nThis debate among grownups over America\u2019s future place in the world will form part of next year\u2019s election contest. But before any fundamental change of direction can occur, the international community \u2013 and the US itself \u2013 must first survive another 16 months of Trump world and the wayward child-president\u2019s poll-fixated, ego-driven destructive tendencies.\n\nSurvival is not guaranteed. The immediate choice facing US friends and foes alike is stark and urgent: ignore, bypass and marginalise Trump \u2013 or actively, openly, resist him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump greets Angela Merkel at the G7 summit in France in August, but he rarely misses a chance to be negative about Germany or its strong chancellor. Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters\n\nHere are some of the key flashpoints around the globe\n\nUnited Nations\n\nTrump is deeply hostile to the UN. It embodies the multilateralist, globalist policy approaches he most abhors \u2013 because they supposedly infringe America\u2019s sovereignty and inhibit its freedom of action. Under him, self-interested US behaviour has undermined the authority of the UN security council\u2019s authority. The US has rejected a series of international treaties and agreements, including the Paris climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal. The UN-backed international criminal court is beyond the pale. Trump\u2019s attitude fits with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d isolationism, which questions traditional ideas about America\u2019s essential global leadership role.\n\nGermany\n\nTrump rarely misses a chance to bash Germany, perhaps because it is Europe\u2019s most successful economy and represents the EU, which he detests. He is obsessed by German car imports, on which protectionist US tariffs will be levied this autumn. He accuses Berlin \u2013 and Europe\u2013 of piggy-backing on America by failing to pay its fair share of Nato defence costs. Special venom is reserved for Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, most likely because she is a woman who stands up to him. Trump recently insulted another female European leader, Denmark\u2019s Mette Frederiksen, after she refused to sell him Greenland.\n\nIsrael\n\nTrump has made a great show of unconditional friendship towards Israel and its rightwing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has skilfully maximised his White House influence. But by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, officially condoning Israel\u2019s annexation of the Golan Heights, and withdrawing funding and other support from the Palestinians, the president has abandoned the long-standing US policy of playing honest broker in the peace process. Trump has also tried to exploit antisemitism for political advantage, accusing US Democrat Jews who oppose Netanyahu\u2019s policies of \u201cdisloyalty\u201d to Israel.\n\nRussia\n\nTrump\u2019s evident liking for Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, has been the cause of endless puzzlement, given Moscow\u2019s hostility to Nato and the western democratic alliance, its support for Bashar al-Assad and alleged Syrian war crimes, and its illegal intervention in Ukraine. Trump\u2019s attitude may stem from Putin\u2019s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, which benefited him. But the affinity between them may be better explained by shared autocratic tendencies. Putin is an authoritarian nationalist, like similar rightwing politicians in China, Turkey, Brazil and India whom Trump admires \u2013 and would like to emulate.\n\nChina\n\nDuring his presidential campaign in 2016, Trump provocatively declared China a bigger problem than jihadi terrorism. He claims that China has enjoyed unfair advantages in two-way trade for decades due to its notional designation as a developing country, supposed currency manipulation, and America\u2019s own failure to protect manufacturing industry. He has levelled similar accusations at the EU, Japan, Canada, India and other trading partnersothers. But his remedy \u2013 unilateral punitive tariffs and sanctions \u2013 has disrupted international commerce, shaken global economic confidence and strained political relations with Beijing without demonstrably improving US fortunes.\n\nVenezuela\n\nTrump\u2019s clumsy efforts to engineer regime change in Venezuela and impose a Washington-approved version of democracy mark a regression to the bad old days of the cold war when the US regarded Central and Latin America as its \u201cbackyard\u201d and exclusive sphere of influence. So far, Trump\u2019s attempt, masterminded by John Bolton, to replace the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with a pro-American technocrat, Juan Guaid\u00f3, has failed miserably. Undeterred, he continues to sanction Maduro\u2019s ideological allies in post-Castro Cuba and to exacerbate the Central American migrant crisis, meanwhile enthusiastically embracing Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s president.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nTrump made his first overseas trip as president to Saudi Arabia, signalling the importance he attaches to close relations with the energy-rich, autocratic Gulf kingdom. He has since strengthened the alliance in opposition to Iran, deploying troops to Saudi Arabia and supplying advanced weaponry for its war in Yemen. The Saudi connection has also come to symbolise Trump\u2019s indifference to human rights abuses, whether in the Philippines, Russia or on the US-Mexico border. When the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered by Saudi agents, Trump defended senior figures in Riyadh such as its crown prince who allegedly ordered the killing.\n\nKashmir\n\nWhen Imran Khan, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, visited the White House recently, Trump boasted he was ready to mediate in the long-running dispute over divided Kashmir. It was a vainglorious gesture, reflecting Trump\u2019s ignorance. When, shortly afterwards, India imposed direct rule on Kashmir, effectively detaining its population, Trump did nothing. Whether the issue is the Delhi-Islamabad nuclear standoff, the unending Afghan war, Chinese attempts to gain strategic leverage in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, or the Rohingya refugee tragedy in Bangladesh, Trump\u2019s south Asia policy, like that in sub-Saharan Africa, is ineffectual and near non-existent. Maybe they are lucky.", "description": "With John Bolton dismissed, Taliban peace talks a fiasco and a trade war with China, US foreign policy is ever more unstable and confrontational", "authors": ["Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c92f516e3deb439ec2dec326228925a160c8411a/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c2aceaf4914b0d26923fc60448f3db13", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
