I have a strong urge to wrap her in a blanket and feed her carbs and wine, because Lark feels like a heart cracking right in two. With a squall of strings sawing out dissonant chords over washed-out wall-of-sound production and a heart-bruising howl into the abyss, it\u2019s a real emotional workout. Just remember to warm up before listening or you might pull a tear duct.\n\nGreen Day\n\nFather of All ...\n\n\u201cThis record,\u201d tweeted Billie Joe whatshisname of Green Day like your uncle several whiskies deep, \u201cis The New! soul, Motown, glam and manic anthemic.\u201d He went on (and on), promising, oxymoronically, to \u201ccut through the bullshit\u201d and \u201cteabag all these motherfuckers\u201d, ending on the band\u2019s motto which is, apparently: \u201cNothing says fuck you like a unicorn.\u201d Nothing really says fuck you like a formulaic, radio-play chasing, 2002-sounding two-and-a-half minutes of line-toeing anarchy, if you ask me. Nothing truly says fuck you like a rich punk.\n\nPet Shop Boys ft Years & Years\n\nDreamland\n\nThis joint track with Years & Years\u2019 Olly Alexander comes with all the arms-in-the-air, last night on Earth euphoria of both bands\u2019 oeuvres. It is named after Margate\u2019s well-branded but only OK retro theme park, although of course the wooden rides and rollerdisco are a metaphor, in this case for LGBTQ rights and political freedoms, things that exist in this utopia a world away from Trump, Brexit and, well, most of Thanet.\n\nSlowthai & Denzel Curry\n\nPsycho\n\nPlease ready yourself for more stressful strings. The production on Psycho has the chaotic energy of the film that gives it its name and of the ricocheting synapses of both featured artists: mushy peas, T-rexes, salt, pepper and telescopes all get a look-in as Slowthai and Denzel explain how great they are (very) and how much they will hurt their haters (a lot).\n\nAriana Grande, Miley Cyrus & Lana Del Rey\n\nDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\n\nWith an undertow that sounds like a trap mouse going clip clippity clop and a BPM that feels approximately two times too fast, Ari, Miley and Lana have successfully turned all their leftover scraps into a swagger-less tentpole single for the new Charlie\u2019s Angels soundtrack. Don\u2019t call them angels, obviously; they are bad bitches, thank you very much. Hard to buy into the empowerment when they are still defined by their omniscient boss, though, isn\u2019t it!", "description": "This week\u2019s we\u2019ve got a wall-of-sound power ballad, some radio play-chasing punk, and an all-girl supergroup banger", "authors": ["Kate Solomon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3da93d2ee89f1281a1a09799fcecf7e4bb702aad/261_1013_2928_1756/master/2928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db29a7f414bdfb96551e697405f67e5c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
