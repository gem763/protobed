GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian stocks edge higher on hints of U.S.-China trade progress\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\n* Stocks grind higher on hopes for end to trade friction\n\n* Oil futures bounce back from overnight decline\n\n* Investors warn there are still risks to outlook\n\nBy Stanley White\n\nTOKYO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged up on Thursday\n\nas hopes the United States and China may soon end their\n\nyear-long trade war boosted demand for riskier assets while\n\nworries about a U.S. presidential impeachment bid ebbed.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nwas up 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.45%.\n\nAustralian shares were up 0.13%.\n\nThe renewed optimism over trade pushed market concerns about\n\nU.S. political risks into the background, a day after Democrat\n\nlawmakers said they will open an impeachment inquiry into\n\nPresident Donald Trump's dealings with his Ukraine counterpart.\n\nLifting the investor mood, Trump said a deal to end a nearly\n\n15-month trade war with China could happen sooner than people\n\nthink, which would remove a huge risk to the global economic\n\noutlook. Oil futures rose in Asia in a sign of cautious optimism\n\nabout global economic prospects, but some investors warned that\n\nan end to trade friction is far from certain.\n\n\"Every time there is a hint of positive about trade talks\n\nmarkets rise,\" said William O'Loughlin, portfolio manager at\n\nRivkin Asset Management in Sydney.\n\n\"It feels like the markets are looking to rally. It seems\n\nthe markets haven't caught on to the fact these headlines about\n\ntrade bounce around from one day to the next.\"\n\nU.S. stock futures were down 0.08% early in Asia,\n\nfollowing a 0.62% increase in the S&P 500 on Wednesday as shares\n\nof Nike Inc NKE.N jumped after reporting better-than-expected\n\nearnings.\n\nTrump on Wednesday also announced initial details of a trade\n\ndeal with Japan, which would open up Japanese markets to $7\n\nbillion worth of U.S. products. Despite the progress in Japan trade, Sino-U.S. talks remain\n\nthe bigger concern for global investors.\n\nThe United States and China have been locked in a year-long\n\ndispute over Beijing's trade practices that has slowed global\n\ngrowth and increased the risk of recession for some economies.\n\nAnalysts tempered their optimism over a resolution to the\n\ntrade war because Trump's public comments often send mixed\n\nsignals.\n\nJust on Tuesday, Trump sharply criticised China in a speech\n\nat the United Nations General Assembly, where he said he would\n\nnot accept a \"bad deal\".\n\nStocks also got a lift after data showed that sales of new\n\nU.S. single-family homes rebounded more than expected in August.\n\nDallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said the odds\n\nof a recession in the next 12 months are relatively low, another\n\nreason for investors to shift more money into equities.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier political worries eased as investors\n\nlargely shrugging off the Democrats' decision to begin an\n\nimpeachment inquiry into Trump. That came even as a summary of a\n\ntelephone call showed the U.S. president asked Ukraine's\n\npresident to investigate a political rival. Casting doubts over the likelihood of an impeachment is the\n\nmajority held by Trump's Republicans in the Senate, which can be\n\nused to quash any attempt to remove the president from office.\n\nU.S. crude ticked up 0.27% to $56.64 a barrel, while\n\nBrent crude rose to 0.29& $62.54 per barrel in a sign\n\nsome investors anticipate higher demand for energy and fuel in\n\nthe future due to stronger economic activity.\n\nTreasury yields gave up some of their gains in Asia after\n\nrising in overnight trade.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes\n\nfell slightly to 1.7146%. The two-year yield fell to\n\n1.6635%.\n\n(Editing by Sam Holmes)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian stocks edge higher on hints of U.S.-China trade progress", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB970WT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
