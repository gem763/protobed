(Picture: ITV)\n\nGillian and Catherine have their own issues to deal with (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018It isn\u2019t just their differing politics that\u2019s a source of tension; Alan\u2019s new supermarket job brings an unexpected challenge in the form of a wild local lad, and at Far Slack Farm Gillian faces trouble with a giraffe.\u2019\n\nIt continued: \u2018Meanwhile John (Tony Gardner) is back on the scene, and Caroline (Sarah Lancashire) finds herself entangled in an emotional debacle with someone at work.\n\n\u2018Into all of this jets Alan\u2019s brother Ted on holiday from New Zealand. But it turns out he\u2019s only bought a one-way ticket\u2026 and he hasn\u2019t come alone.\u2019\n\nSounds like we\u2019re in for an absolute treat.\n\nSpeaking of Last Tango In Halifax\u2019s return, creator Sally Wainwright enthused: \u2018Yet again the entire Last Tango cast has proved to be so wonderful together, so uplifting, heart-warming, touching and funny, as they explore Celia and Alan\u2019s relationship further, under the brilliant breath of fresh air that Gareth Bryn\u2019s direction has given them.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast Tango In Halifax returns to BBC One in 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
