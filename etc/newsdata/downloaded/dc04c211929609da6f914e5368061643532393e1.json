Speaker set to step down on Thursday", "language": "en", "text": "Commons Speaker John Bercow is still set to quit on Thursday after 10 years in the post despite the Brexit delay.\n\nThe controversial parliamentary custodian had timed his departure to coincide with that of Britain from the EU.\n\nBut that has now been moved back three months to January 31 at the latest after another Brextension imposed by Brussels.\n\nHe has infuriated Brexiteers with a string of pro-Remain moves in the Commons in the past year.\n\nHowever it is understood that with elections for his replacement already due to take place on November 4, he has no intention of hanging around.\n\nThe controversial parliamentary custodian had timed his departure to coincide with that of Britain from the EU\n\nHe has infuriated Brexiteers with a string of pro-Remain moves in the Commons in the past year\n\nTory MP Shailesh Vara (left) is standing for Speaker, but Sir Lindsay Hoyle is the favourite to take the coveted post\n\nLabour's Harriet Harman, the longest serving female MP, is said to be gaining support for her run at the post\n\nThe Tories are preparing to slash the Commons Speaker's powers if they win the election.\n\nThe holder of the role can never again be allowed to 'bend the rules as they wish', a Cabinet minister has told MailOnline last month.\n\nIn future the Speaker could be obliged to follow the advice of clerks on procedures, rather than being able to ignore it - and their behaviour in the chamber could also be subject to review.\n\nThe Speaker is meant to be an impartial referee of debates, but Mr Bercow has repeatedly been 'creative' with the rules to frustrate the government - saying his duty was to champion MPs against the executive.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit plans were thwarted partly as a result of his intervention, and last month a rebel law was passed ordering the PM to beg the EU for a Brexit extension if he has not secured a deal by October 19.\n\nMr Bercow was also at the centre of protests against the PM's decision to prorogue Parliament in the run-up to Brexit, saying it was 'not normal'.\n\nWhen Andrea Leadsom was Commons Leader he was accused of calling her a 'stupid woman' in the chamber. Mr Bercow insisted he had only said she was 'stupid' and refused to apologise\n\nBut the episode highlighted that the Speaker is the final arbiter of conduct in the Commons \u2013 including his own.\n\nMost Conservative MPs are backing chummy Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle or feisty Tory Brexiteer Eleanor Laing - both currently Deputy Speakers, to succeed Mr Bercow.\n\nBut worried whips have detected a growing movement towards Harriet Harman among Remainer Tory rebels and older women on the Government benches.\n\nOther candidates for the powerful post include Labour's Chris Bryant and Shailesh Vara for the Tories.\n\nAnnouncing his departure in early September, Mr Bercow effectively jumped before he was pushed after Conservatives vowed to oust him at the looming election over his handling of Remainer rebel legislation.\n\nWatched by wife Sally from the public gallery and to cheers and laughter from Labour MPs, Mr Bercow laid out a symbolic date for his departure - saying the least disruptive thing would be for him to quit on October 31.\n\nDame Eleanor Laing is the MP for Epping and a former Tory shadow minister\n\nSir Edward Leigh has been a Tory MP for Gainsborough since 1983\n\nTory Sir Henry Bellingham criticised the Speaker over the first prorogation, saying: 'I think the Speaker rose to the occasion in his own way but I think he shouldn't have shown disbelief'\n\nLabour former minister Chris Bryant said he hated the 'chaos in the chamber'\n\nFormer Labour whip Rosie Winterton (left) is also standing, as is veteran select committee chief Meg Hillier (right)\n\nIn a series of stinging shots at Mr Johnson, a tearful Mr Bercow said he made 'no apology' for being the 'backbenchers' backstop' while in the chair - warning against 'degrading' Parliament.\n\nBut Mr Johnson is poised to exact revenge on Mr Bercow with the outgoing Speaker expected to be the first in 230 years not to be offered a peerage when he quits.\n\nAllies of the Prime Minister said he would rip up the convention that Commons Speakers are automatically elevated to the upper chamber when they resign, in the same way Mr Bercow repeatedly ignored parliamentary precedent when dealing with Brexit.\n\nOpposition MPs gave Mr Bercow - who will walk away with a gold-plated \u00a31million non-contributory pension after 10 years in the famous green chair - a standing ovation after his announcement.\n\nHe was also praised by MEP Guy Verhofstadt who trolled that he should be the UK's next EU commissioner.", "description": "The controversial parliamentary custodian timed his departure to coincide with that of Britain from the EU, which has been moved back three months after another Brextension.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20275540-0-image-a-2_1572261162513.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
