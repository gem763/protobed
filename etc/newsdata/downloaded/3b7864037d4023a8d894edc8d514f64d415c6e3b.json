High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet attends a session of the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nMichelle Bachelet told the U.N. Human Rights Council that alongside possible executions, her office had documented cases of torture of soldiers and others arbitrarily held and urged the government of President Nicolas Maduro to punish perpetrators.\n\nBachelet who issued a report in early July detailing witness accounts of death squads run by the FAES, said non-governmental organization Monitor de Victimas (Victims\u2019 Monitor) had found 57 new presumed executions by FAES members in Caracas that month.\n\nThe government called her earlier report a \u201cselective and openly partial vision\u201d that ignored official information and relied on biased witnesses.\n\nShe has also expressed concern about U.S. sanctions aimed at pressuring Maduro to step down; on Monday she said they were among factors fuelling a mass exodus from the country, which is reeling from hyperinflation and a collapsing economy.\n\nBachelet said even though the sanctions envisaged exceptions for humanitarian assistance, over-caution by the financial sector, lower public revenues and a decrease in oil production were having a serious impact.\n\n\u201cAll of this is contributing to the worsening of the humanitarian situation and the exodus of Venezuelans from the country,\u201d noting that 4.3 million refugees and migrants had already fled the turmoil, most since the end of 2015.\n\nWashington has urged the European Union to join the sanctions, arguing that they would help advance negotiations on a handover of power to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who assumed a rival interim presidency in January.\n\nGuaido, who said Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate, has the support of most Western nations as well as Washington. Maduro calls him a U.S. puppet.\n\nBachelet called for more details from Venezuela\u2019s Public Ministry on what she said it had told her were the convictions of 104 members of the security forces for human rights violations between August 2017 and May 2019.\n\nDespite her recommendations to dissolve the FAES and prevent extrajudicial executions, this was not being done, she said: \u201cOn the contrary, the FAES have received support from the highest level of Government.\u201d.\n\nSome Latin American countries and activists are urging the Geneva forum, whose 47 members include Venezuela, to establish a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Venezuela at the three-week session.\n\nBachelet, who visited Venezuela in June, said 83 opposition members were freed around that time, but the cases of 27 other detainees were still pending and Judge Lourdes Afiuni and journalist Braulio Jatar, conditionally released in early July, had not yet received unconditional freedom.", "description": "The United Nations human rights chief said on Monday that extrajudicial killings appeared to be continuing in Venezuela and the Special Action Forces (FAES) presumed to be responsible had received support from the highest levels of government.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427965970&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8818K", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
