USA TODAY\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins, at the crossroads of their run as a prime NHL contender, revealed today that Evgeni Malkin has a long-term lower-body injury.\n\nCoach Mike Sullivan said it\u2019s not a season-ending injury, but otherwise provided little information. No. 3 center Nick Bjugstad will also be out an extended period.\n\n\u201cWe would expect Geno to be out a little bit longer than Nick,\u201d Sullivan told reporters.\n\nThis is difficult news for a Penguins team that isn\u2019t considered a lock to be one of the top teams in the Metropolitan Division. The Penguins were a 100-point team last season, but other teams in the division have improved, particularly the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nMalkin left Saturday's game in the second period after falling into the boards when he was tripped up by teammate Kris Letang.\n\nMalkin trips over Letang and takes a bump while on his knee. He slowly but immediately heads down the tunnel. pic.twitter.com/qbLCSIgOiU \u2014 ToughCall \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 (@ToughCallBlog) October 6, 2019\n\nMalkin, 33, seemed determined to rebound from his injury-plagued 2018-19 season when he scored 21 goals with a minus-25 in 68 games. But injuries continue to be a problem for the three-time All-Star who remains one of the league's best centers when he's on the ice.\n\nBut Malkin has managed to play 75 or more games only once over the past six seasons.\n\nMeanwhile, Jared McCann seems like the Penguins' best option to be No. 2 center, although Alex Galchenyuk has played some center in the past.\n\nGiven that Bryan Rust is also on the long-term injured reserve, the Penguins will have some cap space available if general manager Jim Rutherford wants to make a move. He has a long history of being an aggressive trader.\n\nIf Malkin is going to be out more than half of a season, it would be surprising if Rutherford didn\u2019t explore his trade options. However, not many teams are looking to move offensive centers, especially not even a week into the season.\n\nInjuries have long played a major role in the NHL standings, but this Malkin injury hurts more than most.", "description": "Penguins center Evgeni Malkin suffered a long-term lower-body injury in second game of the season.
