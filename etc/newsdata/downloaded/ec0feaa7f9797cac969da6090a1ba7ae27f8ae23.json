The 2016 Pro Bowler participated in team drills on Sept. 19, but did not practice the next day.\n\nAccording to Sports Injury Predicator, a website that charts a player\u2019s injury history, Reed\u2019s first documented concussion happened in 2010 as a redshirt freshman at Florida. He suffered at least two more concussions at Florida, according to the website.\n\nAfter being drafted in 2013, Reed suffered his first concussion with the Redskins in Week 11 of his rookie year \u2014 which ended up costing him the final six games of the season.\n\nTwo years later, Reed missed two games after suffering a concussion in a Week 4 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 2016, Reed was documented with at least his sixth concussion following a Week 5 win against the Baltimore Ravens. He then missed the next two games to recover.\n\nReed has now missed 34 games in his career because of his injuries. Besides concussions, the Florida product has dealt with toe, shoulder and chest injuries. He has yet to play a full 16-game season in the NFL.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
