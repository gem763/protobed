It is also whether he set up the Nationals to fall victim to bullpen overexposure, which already claimed one team this postseason. Why exactly did Hudson, who allowed a run in the eighth, throw 20 more pitches in the ninth with what started as a four-run deficit?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe thought we could get him up to about 35 pitches; that would be his max,\u201d Martinez said, explaining why he went back to Hudson. \u201cAnd he was right there.\u201d\n\nNeither Doolittle nor Hudson worried about overexposure in Game 5. Doolittle admitted he liked the work because he felt \u201ca little bit rusty\u201d from the five-day layoff since they last appeared in Game 1. But the worry now is whether they could be overexposed for Game 6 and, if necessary, Game 7.\n\nIn the American League Championship Series, the New York Yankees stretched their bullpen thintrying to compete with the Astros. They turnstiled relievers and eventually pitched only relievers in Game 6. The bullpen held its own until Jos\u00e9 Altuve crushed a home run against the team\u2019s best reliever, Aroldis Chapman, to end their season. Another Yankees reliever, Zack Britton, saw the Astros\u2019 success against their bullpen as a byproduct of familiarity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe more times you face guys as relievers, you get overexposed,\u201d Britton told reporters afterward. \u201cThat\u2019s what I always say, that\u2019s why we\u2019re relievers and not starters. You can overexpose guys. It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d\n\nThe results did not bolster those worries for Doolittle, who threw 14 pitches and overlapped with one batter he\u2019d seen in Game 1 (Carlos Correa), but it did with Hudson. The veteran right-hander faced 10 batters and allowed a quarter of the game\u2019s 16 hardest-hit balls. George Springer, in his second at-bat against Hudson, smoked a ball 111.3-mph bomb \u2014 the night\u2019s highest exit velocity \u2014 into the seats for a two-run home run.\n\nHouston nicked Hudson for one run on three hits in Game 1, but he didn\u2019t believe the sharp contact in the second outing was connected to familiarity. He knew as soon as he saw the double switch that he\u2019d be asked for two innings too, so he crossed off \u201cmental preparation\u201d on the list of possible explanations for the struggles. He settled on poor execution and getting tired at the end of his outing. Springer\u2019s home run came on his 36th pitch, the most he\u2019d thrown in one outing in 15 months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth Nationals relievers believe their styles of play don\u2019t lend to overexposure. Doolittle almost always throws a high fastball and isn\u2019t shy about it. Hudson uses his fastball and slider 87 percent of the time. The right-hander shrugged off the idea that pitching against hitters once might give them a better idea of how he\u2019d attack them the next time. He believes they should know by looking at the numbers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been kind of up front, I do one or two things,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any tricks up my sleeve. I\u2019ve been doing it for the last four or five years and those guys over there are smart enough to know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I go out there and execute my pitches and pitch to my strengths \u2026 I feel pretty confident that I can get the job done,\u201d he added. \u201cI just made a couple bad pitches to some good hitters and it is what it is.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis holds particularly true in the most clutch moments. Doolittle and Hudson both asserted they\u2019d go with their best against a hitter in a crucial situation. They both have secondary pitches to unbalance the hitter \u2014 Doolittle\u2019s slider, Hudson\u2019s sinker \u2014 but wanted those to mostly remain weapons in idea only for their highest-leverage pitches. The mind-set is don\u2019t get beat with your third pitch.\n\nHudson didn\u2019t on Sunday. Springer homered at the end of a fastball-slider sequence on a 96-mph heater which ended up straight down the pipe. If the reliever executed the pitch where he wanted to, he likes his chances against Springer. But he didn\u2019t put it low and away, and he left the mound afterward frustrated and with the job undone. The Nationals can no longer afford something like that, and they must hope the chances of it happening again didn\u2019t increase because Hudson pitched this time.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The Nationals wanted to give Daniel Hudson and Sean Doolittle work during Sunday\u2019s loss, but it might hurt them later.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/n2I-wuC1pTphm8wVKSUHDns8TiY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GRK4D5HZGUI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
