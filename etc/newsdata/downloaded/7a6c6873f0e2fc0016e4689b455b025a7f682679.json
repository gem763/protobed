But liberals were quick to point out that Fox News\u2019 prime-time hosts have been among Trump\u2019s most vocal allies in the past few days. On Thursday, Sean Hannity opened his Fox program by addressing, in his words, \u201cthe radical, destructive, delusional Democratic Party and the media mob, their allies in crime, which has now descended into complete and utter madness.\u201d (Fox News said that Wallace was not referring to his prime-time colleagues.)\n\nFriction between Fox News\u2019 news reporting staff and its pro-Trump lineup of prime-time commentators is not new. Journalists in the network\u2019s Washington bureau have grumbled about the president granting interviews to pundits like Hannity rather than the White House team.\n\nWhat was unusual was the spectacle of network personalities clashing on-air. Under the iron rule of its former chairman, Roger Ailes, overt conflict between hosts was quickly snuffed out. That Carlson and Smith traded jabs over 36 hours suggested that Ailes\u2019 style of harsh discipline had eroded at the network.\n\nEarlier in the week, an episode of the talk show \u201cThe Five\u201d deteriorated after liberal pundit Juan Williams suggested that his conservative co-hosts were echoing talking points from the White House. \u201cAsking a foreign government to investigate a political rival is illegal,\u201d Williams said, before his colleagues angrily shouted him down.\n\n\u201cYou get that from Media Matters, Juan?\u201d one co-host, Greg Gutfeld, said in an angered tone, referring to an advocacy group that regularly denigrates Fox News. Even by the standards of \u201cThe Five,\u201d it was a stinging exchange.\n\nWallace, in his appearances Friday on Fox News, offered a grim analysis of Trump\u2019s political standing, even as he made clear he did not view impeachment as inevitable. But he swatted down some of his colleagues\u2019 suggestions that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint contained little of note.\n\n\u201cTo dismiss this as a political hack seems to be an effort by the president\u2019s defenders to make nothing out of something, and there is something here,\u201d Wallace said.\n\nAt one point, news anchor Sandra Smith challenged Wallace, saying that she did not see a clear offer of quid pro quo \u2014 \u201cthe exchange of something for value\u201d \u2014 in the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call.\n\nWallace arched a brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that dirt on Joe Biden and Joe Biden\u2019s son would be of value?\u201d he asked.\n\nFor all the trouble faced by Trump this week, Fox News\u2019 viewership has remained high.\n\nOn Thursday evening, \u201cHannity\u201d was seen by more than 4 million live viewers, a rating that Hannity has achieved only a few times this quarter.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "Fox News personalities are facing heckles, insults and criticism for their coverage this week of President Donald Trump and the impeachment inquiry.And that's just from their own colleagues.In an unusual airing of intramural grievances, Fox News anchors and pundits have let loose at one another in", "authors": ["Michael M.
