According to industry sources, Kyle and Jackie are being paid $8million each per year, which makes their deal in total worth around $80million\n\n'Not many people get to go to work each day to share stories, laugh with their best friend and create entertainment that hopefully makes our listener's day that little bit lighter - that isn't lost on me. We're so grateful to be able to continue this journey with ARN,' she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle said he still feels at home at KIIS FM after the pair defected from the Southern Cross Austereo-owned 2Day FM in 2013.\n\n'Obviously Jackie and I decided to re-sign with ARN, we launched KIIS 106.5 so we really feel like it's our station,' he said. 'Plus our show keeps getting better every year. It's a great time for us and for radio in Sydney.'\n\nThe hosts, who have worked together since their days on the Hot 30 Countdown in the early 2000s, addressed their contract renewal on air on Thursday.\n\n'Jackie and I have re-signed and extended our radio deal so this show will be continuing on the air every day until 2024,' Kyle said, adding that the pair's contract was 'the biggest media deal in Australian history.'\n\nHumble: Kyle did not confirm or deny rumours about his salary, saying he '[doesn't] discuss the absurd amount of money I get given to do something I love'\n\nThe latest contract renewal comes after Kyle made headlines in September for his offensive on-air remarks about the Virgin Mary.\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that advertisers were ending their contracts with the show in response to the backlash.\n\nAn Australian not-for-profit business, Speckle, stopped advertising with KIIS FM following Kyle's comments.\n\nWhat was Kyle's joke? On September 18, Kyle offended thousands of listeners - and attracted 150 formal complaints to media watchdog ACMA - by saying the Virgin Mary wasn't actually a virgin at all. 'I thought Mary was his [Jesus Christ's] girlfriend but apparently it was the mother,' he said. 'And the mother lied obviously and told everyone, \"Nah I got pregnant by a magical ghost\". Bulls**t. 'Someone chock-a-blocked her behind the camel shed... You might believe everything that's written down 2,000 years ago to be absolutely accurate and good on you, you're dumb. Dumb as dog s**t.' The segment went unnoticed at the time, but went viral days later when it was shared to KIIS FM's social media channels.\n\n'We are strong advocates for the respect and empowerment of women and their families, and do not condone any comments that are detrimental to this,' a spokesperson for Speckle said.\n\nThe spokesperson added that Kyle's joke was 'inconsistent' with the company's values and the people they work with.\n\nDespite issuing an eight-minute apology to Christians and Muslims, the show faced an exodus from other advertisers.\n\nA2 Milk said they were reviewing their deal with the show but welcomed the apology.\n\nOther advertisers such as Booking.com and Budget Direct were also considering their options in light of the vilifying comments.\n\nAt the time, an ARN spokesperson confirmed they were working with their advertisers to address any issues.\n\nThe Virgin Mary saga began on September 18, when Kyle joked on air that Mary was not actually a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus Christ.\n\n'I thought Mary was his [Jesus's] girlfriend but apparently it was the mother,' he said.\n\n'And the mother lied obviously and told everyone, \"Nah I got pregnant by a magical ghost\". Bulls**t.\n\n'Someone chock-a-blocked her behind the camel shed\u2026 You might believe everything that's written down 2000 years ago to be absolutely accurate and good on you, you're dumb. Dumb as dog s**t.'\n\nControversy: The latest contract renewal comes after Kyle made headlines in September for his offensive on-air remarks about the Virgin Mary\n\nHis remarks led to religious protesters gathering outside KIIS FM's headquarters in North Ryde, calling for Kyle to be sacked. At the time, Kyle was on holiday in Los Angeles, where he owns a second home.\n\nThe Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) later confirmed it had received dozens of complaints.\n\nKyle eventually apologised for his comments, saying he didn't realise the gravity of what he'd said until his phone number was leaked online and he began receiving angry calls from listeners.\n\n'I didn't realise the gravity of it. I upset a lot of people,' he said. 'Even friends of mine were like, \"Bro how could you say something so dumb like that?\"'\n\nIn hot water: Kyle's remarks led to religious protesters gathering outside KIIS FM's headquarters in North Ryde, calling for Kyle to be sacked\n\nHe said that he 'only wanted to make people laugh' and emphasised that the joke was 'not planned' in any way.\n\nKyle explained that the worst part of the whole experience was that people close to him had received death threats over what he'd said on air.\n\nBut he made it clear to naysayers that he wouldn't be quitting his job.\n\n'I am going to quit? No. Am I going to get fired? No. Am I sorry? Absolutely I am sorry because, as I've said, I never intended to purposely upset anyone. Obviously I have upset people and I am sorry for it. There is nothing else I can do. We have all made mistakes in our life and this is just one of the many I have made,' he said.", "description": "Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson have signed  another five-year deal with  Australian Radio Network (ARN), the company which owns KIIS 106.5.", "authors": ["Chloe-Lee Longhetti For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/23/19809134-0-image-a-29_1571263353426.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
