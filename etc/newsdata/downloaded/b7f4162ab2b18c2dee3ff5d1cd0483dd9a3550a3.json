The argument over odor is part of an acrimonious debate over how to regulate the region\u2019s growing marijuana industry, pitting farmers against some residents.\n\nA worker waters cannabis plants at the Autumn Brands licensed cannabis cultivator farm in Carpinteria, Calif.

More than two years after the state stopped requiring a doctor\u2019s note to buy the drug, but left it up to locals to decide where it should be grown, less than half its 58 counties allow commercial farming.\n\nSome counties like Sonoma, in the heart of wine country, have limited pot farms\u2019 size and their proximity to residential areas. Calaveras County, located in the Sierra Nevada foothills, quickly permitted hundreds of grows, then reversed course and banned them. Santa Barbara rushed in with few reservations at first and growers here captured 886 provisional cultivation licenses, more than any other county, according to the state. Most farmers here hold multiple permits to increase the size of their operations.\n\nWorkers hang up cannabis plants at Autumn Brands licensed cannabis cultivator farm.

The state\u2019s legal industry is expected to reach $3.1 billion in sales this year, according to a report from research firms Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics. Illegal sales, meanwhile, are expected to hit $8.7 billion, the report said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Are there cannabis businesses in your area? How has the experience been? Join the conversation below.\n\nOfficials in Santa Barbara, known for its coastal views, affluent enclaves and wine industry, allowed large grows in an effort to boost the local economy, particularly aimed at retooling wilting flower farms in the large greenhouses clustered in Carpinteria.\n\n\u201cEmpty greenhouses mean less taxes,\u201d said Mr. Williams, the supervisor. \u201cLess property taxes for schools.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs can open cannabis farms of any size, in contrast to the limits in many other counties, and at first were allowed to grow if they signed an affidavit that they had previously grown medical cannabis.\n\nLarge cannabis grows began popping up throughout the county, with a particular concentration in Carpinteria, where 13,000 people live next to 28 licensed operators, according to the county.\n\n\u201cThat smell is in the carpet. You can smell it on the towels,\u201d said Joan Esposito, 76, who lives near some of the greenhouses.\n\nAutumn Brands cannabis-cultivator farm uses an odor-prevention system.

Photo: Roger Kisby for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSo far, county tax revenue\u2014$6 million in the first year and about $8 million in the second\u2014has come in on the low side of the county\u2019s projections of between $5 million and $25 million a year, he said.\n\nHans Brand, a former flower grower, said he switched to cannabis because cheaper flowers coming from Latin America were making it difficult to compete.\n\n\u201cWe were barely staying afloat and this way we could make some money,\u201d said Mr. Brand.\n\nInside his Carpinteria greenhouses, there is a four-acre green sea of cannabis plants. Mr. Brand said the crop is more neighbor-friendly than flowers because he uses no pesticide and because semitrailer trucks don\u2019t have to pick up his more compact new product.\n\nFor the business, Autumn Brands, Mr. Brand spent about $100,000 on an evaporation system that he said neutralizes the distinctive aroma.\n\n\u201cI know because I live right here,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Zusha Elinson at zusha.elinson@wsj.com", "description": "California counties like Santa Barbara rushed to grab tax dollars by permitting huge marijuana farms after pot was legalized.
