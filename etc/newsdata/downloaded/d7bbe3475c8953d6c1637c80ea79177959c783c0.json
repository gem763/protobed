A stronger dollar usually makes dollar-pegged commodities like gold less attractive to buyers using other currencies.\n\nHowever, expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may be influenced by the ECB also helped to drive bond yields lower, offering support for bullion, which doesn\u2019t offer a yield. The note yield was down nearly 5 basis points to 1.684% early Thursday from 1.733% late Wednesday.\n\nPolicy measures implemented by the ECB come ahead of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy gathering, where policy-makers are widely expected to cut U.S. interest rates by 25 basis points on Sept. 18.\n\nReductions to global interest rates and some $17 trillion in government debt that offers a negative yield have helped to bolster appetite for alternatives assets like gold, considered a haven during times of economic uncertainty.\n\nThe ECB is committed to monetary stimulus and we will see calls for fiscal policies grow. Next week, the Fed will deliver the next batch of news that should support gold\u2019s bullish case.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Ed Moya covering: XAU/USD, XAG/USD, Intercontinental Exchange Inc, US Dollar Index Futures.
