IBKR, +0.85% fell slightly in the extended session Tuesday after the brokerage reported third-quarter sales above Wall Street expectations and its quarterly per-share profit was in line with views. Interactive Brokers said it earned $36 million, or 45 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $39 million, or 51 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue was $466 million, compared with $439 million a year ago. The company pinned the results in part on a 19% growth in net interest income and a 12% increase in commissions revenue from a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of 45 cents a share on sales of $461 million. Shares of Interactive Brokers ended the regular trading day up 0.9%.
