Engine maker Pratt & Whitney has also ordered checks on similar engines worldwide.\n\nInvestigators are focusing their attention on recent changes in engine software that may have caused parts that compress air inside the engine to be set in a way that caused mechanical resonance or destructive vibrations, two of the people said.\n\nNeither the aircraft nor the engine have been grounded but pilots have been told to avoid certain combinations of thrust settings and altitude to avoid the risk of a new problem until the root cause of the three Swiss engine failures can be found.\n\nA third source said it may take until December to confirm the cause, while other scenarios have also not been ruled out.\n\nAirbus (PA: ) had no immediate comment.\n\nOfficials at the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is leading an investigation into the recent failures involving the U.S.-built engine, declined comment.\n\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was monitoring the situation closely and coordinating with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe head of Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies (N: ) said earlier this week it was working on finding the cause and remained confident in the new fuel-saving engine.", "description": "Exclusive: Software link suspected in Airbus A220 engine blowouts - sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9N17X-OCABS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
