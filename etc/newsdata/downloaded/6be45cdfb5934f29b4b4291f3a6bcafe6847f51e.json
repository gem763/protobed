Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as other moderates in the race.\n\nThe 10 candidates ditched the introductory boilerplate and dived straight into their differences on health care and the economy, executing veiled shots at each other they\u2019ve telegraphed for weeks. But the highly anticipated face-off between Biden, Warren, and Sanders, the three polling leaders in the race, never really came to a head beyond one exchange on health care.\n\n\u201cHow are we going to pay for it?\u201d Biden asked moments after the debate began, referring to the universal health care plan backed by both Sanders and Warren. \u201cI want to hear that tonight. My distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it,\u201d he said, referring to Warren.\n\n\u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well, I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d the former vice president added, name-dropping former President Barack Obama.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen.

Phillip) More\n\nWarren responded by saying \u201cwe all owe a huge debt to President Obama,\u201d who remains overwhelmingly popular among the Democratic electorate, and explained that she planned to make the richest individuals pay for her plan. Sanders, who has made his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan the signature feature of his candidacy, also made sure not to miss a dig at Biden.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign previewed his attacks in the days leading up to the debate as advisers repeatedly argued that Democrats should select a nominee able to offer \u201cmore than plans,\u201d a reference to Warren\u2019s most popular line on the campaign trail, \u201cI have a plan for that.\u201d\n\nWarren, meanwhile, took swipes of her own ahead of the debate that were widely seen as focusing on Biden. On the campaign trail, Warren repeatedly touted how she is not \u201cspending my time with high-dollar donors and with corporate lobbyists,\u201d a reference to the former vice president\u2019s fundraising events with well-heeled donors.\n\nThe tension between the two campaigns spilled out into the open on the eve of the debate after former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Biden surrogate, penned an op-ed in The Washington Post calling Warren a \u201chypocrite\u201d and saying that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have any trouble\u201d taking his money until she swore off high-dollar fundraisers for her presidential bid this year.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign told reporters on Thursday that he was not involved in the decision to publish the op-ed.\n\nThe expected fireworks between the two candidates fizzled on stage, however. Warren did not bring up the op-ed, and apart from her remarks on Medicare for All, she played it safe by focusing on her plans for the economy and taking on corruption in Washington. Biden ignored Warren\u2019s former work in bankruptcy law and clients, continuing to make his case about \u201crestoring the soul of America\u201d amid the chaotic tenure of President Donald Trump.", "description": "The much-anticipated confrontation between leading 2020 candidates Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders never really came to fruition.", "authors": ["Igor Bobic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tvYvTb0REywHIGWspRjpng--~B/aD0yMjIxO3c9MzMzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b0a6823000010055260d2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
