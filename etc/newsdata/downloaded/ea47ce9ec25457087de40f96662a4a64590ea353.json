Sign up here.\n\nCitigroup Inc. has termed it the most extreme potential American move against China in the escalating rivalry between the world\u2019s largest two economies: restricting access to U.S. finance.\n\nTraders in China\u2019s markets will have to decide how to price that risk on Monday -- just before the start of a week-long holiday -- after Bloomberg reported the Trump administration is discussing ways to limit the use of American money going to Chinese entities. The MSCI China Index fell 1.6% on Friday.\n\nU.S. investment in China\u2019s domestic markets are limited -- residents had $203 billion of long-term mainland Chinese financial assets as of June, little more than double that held in South Africa, according to the U.S. Treasury. Far bigger is the $1.2 trillion market capitalization of Chinese companies on three key U.S. exchanges as of February, according to a report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\n\"It obviously adds yet another layer of uncertainty and does not bode well for a positive outcome for coming trade negotiations,\" said Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors Pte. in Singapore. \"It will force Chinese firms to relist in Hong Kong and China.\"\n\nWhile China has sought to increase the attractiveness of its stock and bond markets, to Chinese firms seeking capital as well as to global funds looking to diversify, the reliance of companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. on foreign exchanges exposes a vulnerability. Just this month, the country removed a hurdle for foreign investment into its stock and bond markets almost 20 years after it first allowed access.\n\nShifting all those listings home would pose major strains for the onshore financial system. China has itself launched a new market to encourage its technology companies to list at home. The so-called Star board in Shanghai was designed with looser trading rules in part so China\u2019s startups would pick mainland exchanges over those in the U.S. or Hong Kong, although the buzz among investors has recently started to fade.\n\nThe news on discussions in Washington, based on people familiar with the internal deliberations, will hit at a time when U.S.-China trade tensions have been less of a challenge for domestic equities. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 1.6% for the month of September as of Friday.\n\nMonday will be traders\u2019 last chance to act on the new risk before a prolonged market closure to mark the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party taking power. Exchanges will then be shut until Oct. 8.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that any moves by the U.S. are imminent, and bilateral high-level trade talks with China are still scheduled for next week. But Friday\u2019s reports showcase the danger of a new front in the two countries\u2019 confrontation.\n\nProposed U.S. legislation that aims to de-list foreign companies from American stock exchanges that violate accounting and oversight rules, if passed, could \u201chave a profound impact\u201d for the more than 200 Chinese companies trading on U.S. exchanges, Citigroup economist Cesar Rojas wrote in a report last month titled \u201cThe Most Extreme U.S. Potential Retaliation: Blocking China\u2019s access to U.S. (financial) markets.\u201d\n\nAny wholesale shift of Chinese initial public offerings to Hong Kong and China would hurt \u201cnew economy\u201d enterprises because the \u201cU.S. capital market is much deeper,\u201d Bank of America Corp. strategists led by David Cui wrote in June.\n\nAnother risk: the two countries engage in a currency war as China promotes global use of the yuan, aiming to erode the \u201cstrategic advantage\u201d America has with the dollar\u2019s role in the global financial system, Cui and his team wrote.\n\nFor now, strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are keeping their near-term target for the yuan to drop to 7.2 per dollar. That\u2019s \u201cin light of renewed uncertainty around portfolio flows,\u201d along with the expectation that the U.S. proceeds with the next round of tariff hikes as scheduled on Oct. 15,\u201d Zach Pandl and colleagues wrote in a note Friday.\n\n--With assistance from Keiko Ujikane and Sofia Horta e Costa.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Anstey in Tokyo at canstey@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Anstey at canstey@bloomberg.net, ;Shamim Adam at sadam2@bloomberg.net, Teo Chian Wei\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0Citigroup Inc. has termed it the most extreme potential American move against China in the escalating rivalry between the world\u2019s largest two economies: restricting access to U.S. finance.Traders", "authors": ["Christopher Anstey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
