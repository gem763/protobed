One has to wonder if government officials had not received their salaries for two months, if the matter would be taken more seriously by the authorities and action taken to rectify the matter.\u201d\n\nAccording to SASSA\u2019s Eastern Cape spokesperson, Luzuko Qina, they have embarked on the process of verifying the bank details of the beneficiaries on their system are correct.\n\nQina said this was as a result of fraudulent activities wherein banking details of beneficiaries were changed from their system without the consent of beneficiaries.\n\nHe added, \u201cBank verification is done on a monthly basis and it is done to ensure that the details of the account holder on our system match those of the beneficiary.\n\n\u201cDuring this process, a social grant payment is withheld and beneficiaries whose payments have been withheld are required to present themselves to their nearest SASSA office with their IDs and current bank statements indicating their correct banking details in order to be assisted.\u201d\n\nAsked about how this affected the 80 cases of non-payment from the ECHO foundation, Qina said that they were affected by the bank verification process which has been put in place to combat fraud.\n\n\u201cOur customer care officials are assisting the affected beneficiaries at the centre in obtaining the required bank statements and completing the process,\u201d Qina said.\n\nSASSA has confirmed that the affected beneficiaries will be paid their outstanding social grants in the next payment cycle of November with effect from September.\n\nQina added, \u201cSASSA wishes to apologise unreservedly for any convenience this has caused as it is the necessary step of ensuring that we curb the fraud that the agency is experiencing.\u201d", "description": "DELAYED social grant payments have left Bay pensioners fuming after waiting months for the South African Social Security Association (SASSA) to pay their monthly funds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
