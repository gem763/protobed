Not because you\u2019re going to be knocked over the head by a robber at a bank (although there were nearly 3,000 bank robberies in 2018 according to the FBI), but because of the breadcrumbs you might leave behind\u2014deposit slips, for example\u2014that are a gold mine for crooks who want to rip you off.\n\n\u201cWe always recommend online banking,\u201d says Liz Loewy, co-founder and chief operating officer of EverSafe, a Bethesda, Md.-based firm that monitors bank and investment accounts, credit cards and credit data for clients.\n\nBut online banking, still relatively new, continues to carry a stigma. More than half of all Americans over the age of 35 say they have security concerns, according to a survey by Nielsen. The survey shows the older you are, the more concerned you\u2019re likely to be.\n\nBut even though online banking is considered safer, it is not without risks, and there are some things you can do to make it even safer.\n\nHere are three key tips:\n\nPassword management. Aside from the obvious\u2014no easy to hack passwords like \u201c12345678\u201d or even \u201cpassword\u201d (yes, some people actually do this)\u2014you should have a different password for every website you visit regularly, especially for your banking app. That may mean too many passwords to remember, in which case you should use a password manager. CNET reviews the best ones here.\n\nUse double authentication. An added later of security means the bad guys can\u2019t access your account if your password somehow gets stolen (more on passwords in a second). This is usually a text sent to your phone. But like anything sent through the air by your wireless carrier, text messages can be hijacked too. So without getting too deep into the weeds with the technical stuff, I\u2019ll just say that you should use something called an \u201cauthenticator app.\u201d I use \u201cGoogle Authenticator,\u201d which you can download from either the Apple App Store or the Android Google Play store. It\u2019s free, and since codes it generates appear only on your phone and aren\u2019t sent through the air, the security is even better.\n\nAvoid public wireless networks. Translation: don\u2019t conduct any financial transactions at the coffee shop or even in a hotel room if you\u2019re on the road. That respectable-looking guy sipping a latte 10 feet away may be scooping up your passwords and could later peer into your bank or brokerage account. Brian Reed, chief marketing officer of NowSecure, a mobile app security firm, tells The Wall Street Journal that you should either use your device\u2019s cellular data or what\u2019s called a \u201cVPN,\u201d or virtual private network that allows you to encrypt your traffic. This could be a bit complicated for a layman, so I suggest going to your mobile store and asking for help\u2014and here is a more detailed primer. Here is some advice and recommendations from PCMagazine.\n\nLoewy admits that all this technology is challenging, even for younger, presumably more savvy users. \u201cThe user experience can be easier,\u201d she admits, but based on decades as a federal prosecutor focusing on elder abuse, she reiterates that banking in person remains the greater vulnerability.\n\nGiven that senior citizens are among the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. population\u2014one in 50 Americans is over the age of 85, and this will double by 2040\u2014the technology can and must be better.\n\nAs this occurs, Loewy urges children or other relatives, along with caregivers, to assist in making sure that a senior citizen\u2019s financial accounts are secure and monitoring them to ensure that they stay that way. \u201cAnd not just bank accounts,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s everything: credit cards, retirement accounts trusts real estate, everything.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that no senior should ever entrust such security to any one person, even a loved one. The three biggest sources of financial fraud are the so-called \u201cthree Fs and a C:\u201d Friends, family, fiduciary and caretakers. Seniors should always have, whenever possible, multiple pairs of eyes reviewing accounts to ensure their security and to keep an eye out for any unusual or unauthorized activity.", "description": "More seniors are banking online \u2014 follow these safety tips", "authors": ["Paul Brandus"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS496_boomer_ZG_20191002122236.jpg"}
