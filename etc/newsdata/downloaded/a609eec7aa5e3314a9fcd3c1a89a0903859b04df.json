Senior crime intelligence officers are consumed with fighting the governing party\u2019s political battles and hiding their own criminal conduct instead of discharging their mandate, says Tebogo Khaas.\n\nGender stereotypes must go\n\nDion Chang argues that the country\u2019s deep-seated patriarchy is entrenched by the language we use when raising our children.\n\nWe not only enforce gender stereotypes, but also automatically belittle young girls and impose limitations on them.\n\nSexual offenses courts must be effective\n\nIt is only by creating an effective and responsive criminal justice system that survivors of gender-based violence can be encouraged to come forward, write Ohene Yaw Ampofo-Anti and Keyan Leung of Sonke Gender Justice.\n\n.
