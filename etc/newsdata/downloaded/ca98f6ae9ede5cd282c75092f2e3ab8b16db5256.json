Just as there are diverse stages in one's life and career, relationships too go through several stages of metamorphosis. Needless to say, the success or failure of your relationship will depend on how well you survive these stages. Here are the basic evolutionary phases every relationship seems to go through.\n\nIt could be love at first or just friendship seeking to cross the boundaries. This is the stage when attraction peaks. Some call it the 'lust' stage - when a couple feels the utterly pleasurable can't-keep-hands-off-each-\n\nother moments. In other words, this is the phase when the hormones can go into overdrive.\n\nThis is the stage when you view everything in your relationship with rose-tinted glasses. This is the stage when you simply adore the follies and foibles of your object of desire. You can say that love is truly blind at this point in your relationship.\n\nThis is the stage when you feel what emotional intensity is all about. You feel deeply attached to each other. This is the time when you start planning for your future. In other words, this is the stage when you genuinely want to work around the ifs and buts in your relationship.\n\nYou can call this the make-or-break stage in your relationship. This is when you start examining each other's dedication or commitment to each other. You make an effort to repair the cracks and crevices that might have appeared in your relationship. Differences start getting more visible.
