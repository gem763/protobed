A recent CIRP report showed that iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max had a share of less than 20%, while the lower-priced iPhone XR had close to 50% share in the sales mix. This is a double-whammy for Apple stock as customers are delaying their upgrades of iPhones and choose lower-priced models when they do upgrade.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis trend has put pressure on the margins within the Products category of Apple. The gross margin for Products fell from 32.8% in the year-ago quarter to only 30.4%, a decline of 2.4 percentage points. Despite an improvement in Services margin, the fall in Products gross margin has led to 70 basis point decline in the total gross margin. Apple is also showing a decline in operating margins as the R&D expense rapidly rises.\n\nWe should see the trend of declining margins continue in the next cycle as the new iPhones will be an incremental improvement over current models. The phones unveiled during today\u2019s Apple event won\u2019t have 5G capability either, risking having their customers defect to rival smartphone makers ahead of the game. A big dip in margins and EPS with stagnant revenue base will limit any bullish sentiment towards Apple stock in the near term.\n\nAAPL Stock Squeezed on Two Fronts\n\nSource: CIRP\n\nCIRP\u2019s report shows that iPhone XR had a 48% share in the overall sales of iPhones in the last quarter. On the other hand, XS and XS Max have less than 20% share. Both XS and XS Max together have a share which is equal to the share of iPhone X in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe popularity of older iPhone models, as well as XR, has limited the sales of higher-priced models. Hence, even though there is a big focus on iPhones over $1,000 among analysts and news coverage, the contribution of these models is very low.\n\nSamsung also mentioned in its recent earnings that sales of Galaxy S10 have been weak. The two most important features desired in a smartphone are camera quality and screen size. Both these features are available in older models or the XR, which reduces the incentive to splurge over $1,000 on more pricey models.\n\nAt the same time, the upgrade cycle is getting longer with every iteration. It is highly likely that more customers will skip the 2019 iPhone cycle because of a lack of a 5G feature and few incremental improvements in the models. This will again push the margins lower for the next few quarters and shift the focus of Wall Street on the 2020 iPhone launch, a major negative for Apple stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nFall in Margins\n\nLower demand for higher-priced iPhones ends up hurting the Products margin.\n\nSource: Apple Filings\n\nThere has been a 2.4 percentage point decline in the gross margin of Products category, a large part of which is made up of iPhones. This decline has more than made up for any positive improvements in the Services gross margin. Hence, the total gross margin has declined by 70 basis points. Even on a longer timeline of nine months, the decline in Products gross margin has been 2.2 percentage points.\n\nThis trend has had a negative impact on operating margin which has declined by 223 basis points in the recent quarter. Apple has now reported a year-on-year decline in operating margin for 13 of the past 14 quarters. The 2019 iPhone cycle is unlikely to change this trend.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales mix within the iPhone segment are moving towards lower-priced models.
