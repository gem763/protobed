Clippers fans could not help themselves, though. They whipped out their phones to document the moment as soon as Kawhi Leonard stepped onto the court.\n\nThey cheered through Leonard finishing with an inefficient 11 points on 3-of-6 shooting and six assists in 11 first-half minutes before sitting in the Clippers\u2019 111-91 preseason loss to the Denver Nuggets on Thursday at Staples Center. They cheered through Leonard offering varying degrees of on-court leadership. They cheered because this marked the beginning of what the Clippers hope will be a nine-month journey that ends with the Moreno Valley native hoisting an NBA championship trophy.\n\n\u201cI feel emotions either getting ready for the game or when I did sign here,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about what can happen, what\u2019s going to happen and being able to play at Staples Center 45 minutes away from my home where I grew up. It\u2019s exciting. Once I step on the floor, it\u2019s lock-in time.\u201d\n\nLA Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard is greeted at the Clippers bench during the first half against the Denver Nuggets at Staples Center.

Within a two-minute span, Leonard sank a 14-foot fadeaway, made a 3-pointer and recorded an assist. He assumed a play-making role. He directed teammates where to cut and corrected their mistakes. Then, Leonard sat down for the entire second half.\n\nThat was more than enough for Clippers forward Montrezl Harrell to observe that Leonard \u201clooked like in mid-season form.\u201d Or for Clippers coach Doc Rivers to describe Leonard\u2019s preseason debut as \u201cabsolutely wonderful.\u201d Or for Clippers guard Landry Shamet to proclaim Leonard as \u201cthe best player in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers had announced following Wednesday's practice that Leonard would sit for this game for rest purposes, as he did for the team's first two preseason games against the Houston Rockets and Shanghai Sharks, but Rivers suggested the organization made a mistake. After Leonard impressed the Clippers in a half-court four-on-four scrimmage before the game, both the Clippers and Leonard signed off on his return. Rivers does not plan to play him in Sunday\u2019s exhibition against the Melbourne United of Australia. Leonard could return for the Clippers\u2019 preseason finale against the Dallas Mavericks on Oct. 17.\n\nThat left Leonard needing to shed as much rust as possible. He had not played in an NBA game since winning his second championship and Finals MVP in a decisive Game 6 against the Golden State Warriors on June 13.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play no contact type of basketball at all,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cNormally, I don\u2019t do that and was not able to work out like I wanted to this summer. But there\u2019s always rust if you\u2019re not playing.\u201d\n\nIt did not take long for Leonard to shed his rust. He said he \u201cfelt prepared for the moment.\u201d Afterwards, Leonard reported feeling fully healthy. Unlike his lone season in Toronto, the Clippers do not plan to have Leonard follow the so-called load management program. After all, Leonard said he has fully healed from a left quadriceps injury that sidelined him two seasons ago for all but nine games during his last year in San Antonio.\n\n\u201cHe just needs minutes. His health is fine,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cBut when you don\u2019t play a lot of pick up games, you lose your rhythm and you need your rhythm back.\u201d\n\nKawhi Leonard walks onto the STAPLES Center floor for the first time as a member of the @LAClippers \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\nIt's gametime!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #PrimeTicket\n\n\ud83d\udcf2: https://t.co/VfjJD31CSPpic.twitter.com/1yh1xCVXEl \u2014 FOX Sports West (@FoxSportsWest) October 11, 2019\n\nSince Leonard joined the Clippers, they have also seen other positive developments that might help win his third NBA title.\n\nThe first example? Leonard\u2019s assertiveness helped him become an effective playmaker.\n\nLeonard handled that responsibility frequently for different reasons. The Clippers sat guards Patrick Beverley and Rodney McGruder for minor injuries. Rivers experimented with lineup combinations, and the Nuggets became more concerned with how Leonard would punish them as a scorer.\n\nHence, Leonard said it \u201cfelt natural\u201d for him to become a facilitator. Rivers predicted how Leonard will handle that role will \u201cgo game-to-game\u201d depending on how opponents guard him and the team\u2019s depth chart. Either way, Leonard has the freedom to operate as he sees fit.\n\nOPINION: Terrible week for NBA may open more eyes to price of doing business in China\n\nSTILL SCRAPPY: Addition of superstars Kawhi Leonard, Paul George won't change Clippers\n\n\u201cThat's just him making plays,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cGood players, smart players, high IQ players know how to play basketball. If they want to take him away, then he gives the ball to the open guy. The great players make the game really simple.\u201d\n\nLeonard made the game look really simple with center Ivica Zubac. He often set picks for Leonard before diving to the basket for an open look. Or that pick gave Leonard enough separation for a shot.\n\n\u201cHe found me every time I was open,\u201d Zubac said. \u201cI really like playing with him.\u201d\n\nThe second example? The seemingly stoic Leonard has a different side to his personality.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more verbal than you would ever know. He\u2019s more demanding in a very positive way,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cYou have to do it right. I love that for our team.\u201d\n\nCLOSE SportsPulse: The NBA offseason was just wild. As training camps get underway Trysta Krick digests, debriefs and explains all the crazy moves made with a map. Take notes and get ready. USA TODAY\n\nWhen he sat during the Clippers\u2019 first two exhibition games, Leonard communicated with his teammates on the bench. So much that Harrell almost likened him to a coach. During practices, Leonard helped the Clippers narrow their focus on fundamentals. During scrimmages, Leonard brought out the competitive side of Lou Williams and Harrell. Leonard also made Clippers forward Paul George feel even more antsy after remaining confined to non-contact drills after having offseason shoulder surgery. Rivers has also noticed Leonard taking a liking toward Clippers rookie Terance Mann.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still learning myself so it\u2019s hard for me to tell guys to be in these certain spots and do this. But the basketball things that I have pretty much learned in my career is what I try to give the insight on as far as the details of the game,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI just try to wiggle myself in those areas and try to give them that knowledge so they know that I\u2019m present. But it takes me to be a player and be active. I\u2019m not a coach so it\u2019s hard for me to just talk on the sideline, unless I\u2019m active or into the contact. That\u2019s when guys really know that I\u2019m here and that I\u2019m playing.\u201d\n\nOnce Leonard started playing, teammates heard his cues. For as much chemistry as Leonard and Zubac established together, they also had their fair share of mistakes. Zubac dropped one of Leonard\u2019s passes. Leonard saw Zubac behind on a defensive rotation. Leonard did not hesitate to talk to him. Zubac liked the feedback both because of what Leonard said and how he said it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the guy that\u2019s going to yell nonsense and all that stuff. But everything he sees that\u2019s important, he\u2019s going to let you know,\u201d Zubac said. \u201cEven on the floor or the bench when the play\u2019s over he\u2019s going to be like, \u2018That play like five minutes ago,\u2019 and then he\u2019s going to explain what happened. He\u2019s going to walk you through it. He\u2019s a good leader.\u201d\n\nAll of which Leonard showed in an efficient 11 minutes. The Clippers can only imagine what Leonard will display with increased playing time during consequential games. Then, Clippers fans will have plenty of reason to cheer and capture the moment on their phones.\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA reporter Mark Medina on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.", "description": "Kawhi Leonard made his preseason debut with the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night, and the team can't wait for more.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published A.M.
