(NASDAQ:UNTY) An Attractive Dividend Stock?", "language": "en", "text": "Could Unity Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNTY) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nInvestors might not know much about Unity Bancorp's dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last six years and offers a 1.4% yield. While the yield may not look too great, the relatively long payment history is interesting. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNasdaqGM:UNTY Historical Dividend Yield, October 9th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Unity Bancorp paid out 14% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. We like this low payout ratio, because it implies the dividend is well covered and leaves ample opportunity for reinvestment.\n\nWe update our data on Unity Bancorp every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Looking at the data, we can see that Unity Bancorp has been paying a dividend for the past six years. The dividend has been quite stable over the past six years, which is great to see - although we usually like to see the dividend maintained for a decade before giving it full marks, though. During the past six-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.036 in 2013, compared to US$0.32 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 44% per year over this time.\n\nThe dividend has been growing pretty quickly, which could be enough to get us interested even though the dividend history is relatively short. Further research may be warranted.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. It's good to see Unity Bancorp has been growing its earnings per share at 34% a year over the past five years. The company is only paying out a fraction of its earnings as dividends, and in the past been able to use the retained earnings to grow its profits rapidly - an ideal combination.\n\nConclusion\n\nDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. We're glad to see Unity Bancorp has a low payout ratio, as this suggests earnings are being reinvested in the business. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, although its dividend history is not as long as we'd like. Unity Bancorp has a credible record on several fronts, but falls slightly short of our standards for a dividend stock.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Unity Bancorp, Inc.
