I'm just a cricket writer, I don't earn big bucks and it's costing me in interest.\"\n\nImage copyright Peter Lalor Image caption The Deuchers IPA carried the advertised price of \u00a35.50\n\nWriting on Twitter, he said: \"I didn't have my reading glasses when she presented me with a bill. I said I didn't want a receipt and she went to leave.\n\n\"Something, however, made me ask: 'How much did I just pay for that beer?' She checked, covered her mouth, started to giggle and refused to tell me, saying only there had been a mistake and she would fix it.\n\n\"She kept giggling. I told her it needed to be fixed and fixed right now.\n\n\"She ran to get her manager who took the situation far more seriously and went about attempting to arrange a refund. She told me somebody would be in contact.\"\n\nTwo mornings later, Mr Lalor says he took a call from his wife to say the money had indeed left their account.\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption The Malmaison hotel apologised and said an investigation was under way\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nMr Lalor, who also writes about beer for his newspaper, said: \"To add insult to injury they charged a \u00a31,000 transaction fee. Until the money comes back I won't rest easy.\"\n\nA hotel spokesman said: \"We are currently carrying out an investigation into what took place. We have been in contact with Peter to apologise and ensure this has been resolved as quickly as possible.\"\n\nAs for the beer itself, Mr Lalor said that at least was a success.\n\n\"It's a good beer,\" he later tweeted. \"The original version of it won a heap of awards, including the Supreme Champion Beer of Britain, but if you are thinking that no beer is worth the best part of 100,000 dollars, then I am inclined to agree with you.\"\n\nA spokesman for Visa said the \"unusual\" case shows how important it is to always check details of payments and receipts.\n\nHe added: \"Visa does not make decisions to authorise payments. It is the responsibility of a cardholder's bank who will make a decision based on a number of factors including the funds available.\n\n\"We will work with both the cardholder's and merchant's banks to help resolve this error.\"", "description": "Peter Lalor is waiting for a refund after being mistakenly charged \u00a355,315 for a \u00a35.50 bottle of ale.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/822A/production/_108622333_ecb0bd25-4e9c-4b78-a7ff-95adfb61edf9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
