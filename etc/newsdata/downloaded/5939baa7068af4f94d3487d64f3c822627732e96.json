The charges carry the same sentencing range.\n\nOn the day of the attack, all of the prisoners had returned to their cells, but Witt refused.\n\nAt one point, Witt became agitated and even stripped off all of his clothes before putting them back on.\n\nAccording to the Chronicle, he also pushed over a water cooler, which apparently angered Joffrion.\n\nA captain later arrived and Witt became compliant enough for the guards to cuff him.\n\nBut moments later, he jerks away from them, prompting Joffrion to grab Witt from behind, lift him more than a foot off the floor and slam him to the ground.\n\nAt the time, the guards had no clue that the force had ruptured the inmate's liver and he started bleeding internally, according to the Chronicle.\n\nWitt was able to get to his feet, but he soon fell to the ground and was taken to a hospital where he died two hours after emergency surgery.\n\nJoffrion resigned two days later after being recommended for termination, said Jeremy Desel, a prison spokesman.\n\nThe incident was captured on video at the Darrington Unit (file image) in Rosharon, south of Houston\n\nEarlier this year, prison officials condemned Joffrion's conduct but noted a powerful painkiller in the slain inmate's blood as a possible cause of the altercation.\n\nAt the time, Texas Department of Criminal Justice Executive Director Bryan Collier, said: 'While the use of force was deemed excessive in the investigation, an autopsy of offender Witt did find the presence of fentanyl, an extremely powerful synthetic opioid, which could explain the actions which prompted the use of force.'\n\nWitt's family members said they weren't informed of the circumstances surrounding his death for months.\n\nOfficials didn't report Witt's death as a homicide until the full autopsy was completed a year later.\n\nIt's unclear whether the drug was smuggled illegally into prison or given as treatment at the hospital, where Witt had undergone surgery prior to this death.\n\nPrison officials did not further elaborate.\n\nConnie Williams, the lawyer representing Joffrion, said his client followed proper procedures.\n\n'There are some suggestions that he slammed him too hard,' Williams said. 'But there was no intent to kill anybody.'\n\nWeeks before the August 2017 attack, state officials said Joffrion had completed six months of disciplinary probation for another violent encounter with Witt.\n\nWitt had suffered from mental health issues before he was imprisoned, his family noted.\n\nHe was charged with aggravated robbery in 2004, resulting in a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nWitt was in and out of the system's psychiatric prisons during the first few years, according to his mother.\n\nOccasionally, she would visit the prison and Witt couldn't recognize who she was. In other instances, Witt wouldn't recognize himself.\n\n'He was such a sweet man,' Rosemary said. 'And prison destroyed him.'", "description": "Ex-Texas prison sergeant, Lou Joffrion (left), has been found not guilty of aggravated assault after a video showed him throwing David Witt (right), 41, to the ground so viciously that he died.", "authors": ["Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/18/19703164-0-image-a-24_1571073359198.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
