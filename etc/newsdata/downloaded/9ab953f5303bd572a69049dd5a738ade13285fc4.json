And I think for the last couple of years the strong characters have disappeared and [are] not making a difference anymore.\"\n\nUnited splashed the cash in the summer but failed to bring in a top-class striker to replace Romelu Lukaku.\n\n(Image: Hollandse Hoogte/REX)\n\nVan der Sar added: \"Of course, the name [of Manchester United] is there. And of course the following they have all over the world.\n\n\"But for a player\u2026you want to play at a certain level, you also want to have an idea that you can win trophies and they must take that opportunity also to improve the squad and make the world-class players they have, or the players that they\u2019re going to sign, that they feel welcome and that there\u2019s a good path to where they\u2019re going to go to.\"", "description": "The Red Devils have made a disastrous start to the season, winning just twice in eight games", "authors": ["Jacob Murtagh", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Hollandse Hoogte Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20547665.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-St-James-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
