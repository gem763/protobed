(AP Photo/ISNA, File)\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 For decades considered a U.S. national security priority, the Persian Gulf remains home to tens of thousands of American troops spread across sprawling bases protecting crucial routes for global energy supplies.\n\nBut while U.S.-Iran tensions in the Gulf appeared close to sparking a global conflagration this summer, attention now rapidly has shifted to Syria in a conflict that no less has impact here.\n\nCountries across the Persian Gulf wonder what they should take away from President Donald Trump's withdrawal of American forces from Syria after apparently acquiescing to Turkey's invasion of Kurdish territory.\n\nJust as Turkey's expedition has seen a rapid flux in alliances in Syria's yearslong war, it also has seen Gulf Arab nations make their own calculations about how far to trust Trump if tensions with Iran boil over. These nations all have their own views on Turkey's ambitions under President Recep Tayyep Erdogan as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. withdrawal comes after years of Tehran calling for America to end its military presence in a nation Iran views as a critical outpost to pressure Israel.\n\nTrump has boosted the U.S. military presence across the Persian Gulf since May, when he sent an aircraft carrier strike group, nuclear-capable B-52 bombers and advanced jetfighters to the region over what the White House described as threats from Iran. In the time since, he's sent U.S. troops and Patriot missiles into Saudi Arabia for the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, an assault launched by al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in part over America's presence there.\n\nThe tensions worry Kuwait and Oman, which have worked to ease tensions. Kuwait even went so far as to tell its public it had eight months' worth of food in case of a national emergency. Qatar, still boycotted by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has relied on Iranian airspace and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran that provides the nation its wealth.\n\nHowever, Saudi Arabia likely understands the transactional nature by which Trump framed his decision. That's been apparent since Trump waved posters showing its weapons purchases before a bemused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office last year.\n\n\"We are sending troops and other things to the Middle East to help Saudi Arabia,\" Trump told journalists on the White House lawn on Oct. 11. \"But are you ready? Saudi Arabia at my request has agreed to pay us for everything we're doing. That's a first.\"\n\nBoth Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the federation of sheikhdoms home to Dubai, welcomed Trump's election and his policy of increasing pressure on Iran. But after Trump backed down from retaliating over Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone in June, the UAE has made efforts to ease tensions with Tehran by sending officials there. It also began pulling its troops out of a yearslong, Saudi-led war in Yemen against rebels backed by Iran.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed even recently told CBS that the kingdom is \"open to all initiatives for a political solution in Yemen.\" That's a long way from another CBS interview last year in which he compared to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.\n\nThat pragmatism can be heard in how both Saudi Arabia and the UAE look at Syria. Since the start of the country's war in 2011, it backed those trying to overthrow Assad.\n\nLately, though, Emiratis appear to have accepted the idea of Assad remaining in Syria. They reopened their embassy in Damascus in December and are encouraging Emirati business officials to invest there to increase the UAE's soft power.\n\nThe National, the Abu Dhabi-based, government-linked newspaper, in an editorial Tuesday even went as far as to refer to Assad as \"the lesser of two evils\" for the Kurds. It criticized the U.S. for leaving the Kurds \"abandoned\" with \"little leverage.\"\n\n\"The world must not stand idle while Syria is invaded and its various ethnic factions endure yet more losses,\" the newspaper said.\n\nThat the UAE would move closer to accepting Assad suggests Saudi Arabia may not be far behind. And while they remain suspicious of Iran's influence, it is likely they view Turkey as the greater concern.", "description": "For decades considered a U.S. national security priority, the Persian Gulf remains home to tens of thousands of American troops spread across sprawling bases protecting crucial routes for global energy supplies.
