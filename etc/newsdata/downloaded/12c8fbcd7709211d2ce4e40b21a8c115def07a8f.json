They recognize that Democrats are trying to nullify their votes. And, it is just bringing in so much enthusiasm, but also financial support for the president, which is allowing us right now to attack Democrats in their home districts.\"\n\nCNN ANCHOR SLAMS PENCE ON RESPONSE TO TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL: 'WE ALL KNOW' THAT HE'S 'LYING'\n\n\"They've been trying to impeach this president since day one. Democrats have never accepted the results of 2016,\" said McDaniel.\n\nDuring the third quarter of this year, President Trump and the RNC brought in a whopping $125 million in fundraising. The 2020 campaign's fundraising arm said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank.\n\nFormer President Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011.\n\nMSNBC'S MADDOW DECLARES TRUMP WILL BE 'IMPEACHED,' SUGGESTS BARR, POMPEO COULD 'FIND THEIR NECKS AT RISK'\n\n2020 Democrats are also putting up big fundraising numbers, but not quite as large as the president's campaign.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hauled in $25.3 million during the third quarter of fundraising, up more than $7 million from his second-quarter figures.\n\nAdditionally, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign reported Tuesday that they raked in $19.1 million over the past three months. However, that figure was down from the $24.8 million he brought in during the second quarter.\n\n\"The money coming in for this president is showing that we are well ahead. People know their lives are better and they are willing to put their money behind it,\" she told Kilmeade.\n\nMcDaniel said that the Democrats have \"done nothing since the president has gotten elected,\" pointing to the USMCA trade deal and that she's not worried about their campaign.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"Americans are looking at this as a total partisan attack against this president. I mean, you look at the phone call [with the Ukrainian president]. Anybody looking at the phone call knows there's nothing impeachable,\" she said.\n\n\"And, when it's only down party lines and Democrats from day one have refused to work with this president,\" McDaniel said, \"I think Americans are saying, 'Enough is enough. Why don't you get to the negotiating table and work on our behalf, instead of trying to negate the votes of 63 million Americans?\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Alex Pappas, Paul Steinhauser and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump and the Republican National Committee's\u00a0fundraising numbers during the past couple of weeks, marked by the\u00a0impeachment inquiry, show Democrats' efforts are backfiring with voters, RNC\u00a0Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Friday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Dev_ENC1_132146596337480000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
