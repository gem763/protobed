German respondents stood out with just 48% in favour and 36% against.\n\nOver three-quarters of respondents thought Draghi had helped boost the institution's reputation.\n\n\"Mario Draghi almost single-handedly saved the euro... and built consensus to sustain the euro area economy in the face of German opposition,\" one of the respondents said.\n\n\"Nonetheless, during his time we have seen...some arbitrary appointments and promotions, as well as nationality clustering in management positions.\n\nThe ECB has had to cancel six appointments over the last few years as a result of appeals by staff representatives.\n\nThe instituion does not provide a breakdown of its staff by nationality.\n\nBut four out of six counsellors to the ECB's Executive Board members come from Germany, as do the top three managers at its statistics directorate and ten out of 26 managers in its monetary policy and economics directorates, according to IPSO calculations.", "description": "European Central Bank staff back Mario Draghi's aggressive stimulus policy but resent the perception that he relied on a \"kitchen cabinet\" and allowed favouritism at the institution, a survey showed on Wednesday.
