Job creation may also be hampered as firms employ fewer workers to produce goods and services for export.\"\n\nThe WTO emphasised that the \"high degree of uncertainty\" surrounding global trade affects the organisation's projections. Figures could worsen if trade tensions escalate, or the numbers could improve if the sparring abates.\n\nThe WTO further warned that additional rounds of tariffs - and retaliation against those levies - \"could produce a destructive cycle of recrimination\".\n\nConstantly shifting monetary and fiscal policy could destabilise volatile financial markets. A sharper slowdown of the global economy could produce an even larger downturn in trade. And complications from Brexit could have ripple effects throughout Europe, the WTO said.\n\nMajor economies around the world are either already in recession or on the brink. Many of the countries experiencing downturns are also highly dependent on selling goods overseas, which doesn't bode well during a global trade war.\n\nGermany, for example, is heavily reliant on manufacturing cars and other industrial goods, and the German government has been reluctant to spend money to stimulate growth. Italy, the eurozone's third-largest economy, entered a recession last year and has struggled from political crises that have hampered additional economic aid from the government.\n\nMexico has been a target of Trump's trade and immigration fights, and Brazil, the largest economy in South America, has struggled to sell goods overseas and is seeing slowed demand at home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United Kingdom has also seen an investment slump, largely due to uncertainty over Brexit. Many worry that if Britain were to leave the European Union without a deal, the nation would enter a recession.\n\nBritain's possible departure from the European Union was thrust into further chaos last month when its highest court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's recent decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful.\n\nAt the heart of the White House's trade war with China are escalating tariffs placed on Chinese imports.\n\nThe White House has imposed tariffs on more than $US250 billion in Chinese goods, with higher tariffs set to go into effect before the end of the year. Despite the fact that the tariffs are spiking costs on a range of products, Trump claims that they are crucial to disrupting the Chinese supply chain and recalibrate the economic ties between Washington and Beijing.\n\n\"The multilateral trading system remains the most important global forum for settling differences and providing solutions for the challenges of the 21st century global economy,\" Azevedo said.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "World merchandise trade volume is now expected to rise 1.2 per cent in 2019 - markedly slower than the WTO's 2.6 per cent forecast in April.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_82/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/082456bcef05e2d0a0e16b6b56dc0bd5c380f5e3", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
