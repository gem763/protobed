(AP)\n\nRain fell, clouds hung low in the sky and the air was choppy when Cokie Roberts\u2019s father boarded a plane in 1972 to campaign in Alaska for the reelection of a fellow congressman.\n\nRoberts\u2019s father, then-House Majority Leader Hale Boggs (D-La.), met Alaska Rep. Nicholas Begich (D) at Anchorage International Airport on Oct. 16 to board a chartered Cessna 310 for a 550-mile flight to Juneau, The Washington Post reported. Both congressmen\u2019s wives had considered joining the trip, but decided they had too much to do in D.C.\n\nThe plane took off at 9 a.m. in low visibility, flew along the Portage Pass and neared the snow-capped Chugach Mountains. The control tower last heard from the pilot at 9:12 a.m.\n\nWhen the phone rang a few hours later at the Begich household in McLean, Va., Alaska Gov. Bill Egan (D) was on the line. Begich\u2019s wife, Pegge, immediately knew something was wrong.\n\n\u201cI just had an awful feeling in the pit of my stomach,\u201d she told The Washington Post.\n\n[Cokie Roberts, Emmy-winning journalist and political commentator, dies at 75]\n\nAs authorities searched for the missing plane, Boggs\u2019s wife, Lindy, invited the Begiches to their home in Bethesda, Md., the next day for a private Mass celebrated by Boggs\u2019s brother Robert, a Catholic priest. The families received various reports that potential debris had been discovered, but none of it turned out to be the congressmen\u2019s plane.\n\nAt Pegge Begich\u2019s urging, the Boggs family decided to go to Alaska while the search continued. Roberts, who died Tuesday at the age of 75, was reluctant. Then 28, she had two young children and a TV news job in California.\n\n\u201cIf you were missing in Alaska,\u201d Lindy Boggs told Roberts, \u201cDaddy would go looking for you.\u201d\n\n\n\nVice President Gore swears in Lindy Boggs as ambassador to the Vatican in November 1997.

Diggs/Associated Press)\n\nOver the next 39 days, the Boggs family got regular briefings and photos from spy planes based at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage. Hunters, boats and more than 70 airplanes joined in the search, which was the largest in Alaska\u2019s history at that time. They found another plane that had been missing for 17 years, but they never recovered the congressmen\u2019s aircraft.\n\nThe conspiracy theories surrounding the disappearance mounted: Maybe a bomb had exploded on board, or perhaps Boggs\u2019s role in the Warren Commission \u2014 charged with investigating the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy \u2014 had something to do with the disappearance. Boggs had expressed doubts about the commission\u2019s majority opinion that Kennedy and Texas Gov. John Connally were struck by a single bullet and therefore there was just one assassin.\n\nIn a note forwarded to Pegge Begich from her husband\u2019s office, scraps of newsprint from the Detroit Free Press spelled out another theory about the politicians\u2019 disappearance: His Croatian heritage and his support of Croatian nationalism might have gotten him assassinated by Serbians, the note said. Both ethnic groups were common in Yugoslavia at the time, and tensions ran high.\n\nBoggs and Begich were reelected the November after their disappearance, although they had not been found. On Jan. 3, 1973, however, the House of Representatives recognized the congressmen\u2019s deaths.\n\n[JFK assassination conspiracy theories: The grassy knoll, Umbrella Man, LBJ and Ted Cruz\u2019s dad]\n\nLindy Boggs and Pegge Begich competed in a special election to fill their husbands\u2019 seats. Lindy Boggs won and went on to serve for nine terms. President Bill Clinton (D) later appointed her the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.\n\nThe missing congressmen, meanwhile, eventually got a cenotaph at Congressional Cemetery in Southeast Washington.\n\nRoberts told The Post in 2010 that her mother wanted them to have a monument: \u201cShe thought that would be a good idea for Daddy and Nick Begich, because they were never found and couldn\u2019t be buried. Daddy\u2019s plaque is on one side of it, and Nick Begich\u2019s is on the other side. So it\u2019s like they are together for eternity.\u201d\n\nIn a 1991 opinion piece for the New York Times, Roberts wrote that she empathized with the families of missing Vietnam War soldiers because of her father\u2019s disappearance.\n\n\u201cI know my father is not alive. I know that the most massive search ever conducted in this country would have found that plane had it not sunk to the bottom of the sea,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut still, I catch myself hesitating before changing the kitchen wallpaper, fearing that he will come home and think strangers are in the house. ... So the uncertainty will always nag at the back of my brain. But at least I have the satisfaction of knowing that my country did everything it could.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nActress Sharon Tate was young, beautiful and pregnant.
