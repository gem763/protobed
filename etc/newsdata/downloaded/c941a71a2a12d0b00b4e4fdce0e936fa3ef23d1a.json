Durling, just the 5th chief winemaker for Beaulieu since its debut at the turn of the 20th century, jauntily rolls up in a 1925 Cadillac originally owned by the winery\u2019s founder, Georges de Latour.\n\nAs grand a spectacle as it was, the crowd wasn\u2019t there for the car. They were there for taste of the 2016 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, the 80th anniversary of one of the first true cult Cabernets of Napa Valley.\n\n\u201cThe Georges de Latour gained a name for itself very quickly, it was the pride and joy of the American wine industry,\u201d Durling says. \u201cIt truly set the bar of quality for the entire region.\u201d\n\nDurling says the wine was commonly served not only at major social events but at formal state dinners, an early oenophilic emissary for the fledgling American wine industry across the globe.\n\nThe 80th anniversary release is a stunner, the result of what Durling calls a \u201cfantastic vintage across the board, and one of the best GDLs ever made.\u201d The wine offers a velvety mouthfeel with dark chocolate and cocoa powder, as well as tannic, spicy oak and a touch of tart cherries and acid here in its youth.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find what has become a hallmark of Beaulieu Vineyards, what\u2019s referred to as Rutherford dust, a signature tasting note from the Rutherford AVA. As Durling explains, it\u2019s \u201cthe texture and flavor profile of tannins that are unique to this region,\u201d developing a sort of structured tannic mouthfeel with that dark, dry cocoa powder.\n\nThe term was apparently coined by the legendary Beaulieu winemaker Andr\u00e9 Tchelistcheff, known as \u201cthe maestro,\u201d who was responsible for much of the across-the-board quality improvements that took the entire Napa Valley from fringe region to world class status. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the most important winemaker in the history of Napa valley,\u201d Durling says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much comes back to Andr\u00e9.\u201d\n\nTrevor Durling is just the 5th chief winemaker for Beaulieu since its debut at the turn of the 20th century. Beaulieu Vineyards\n\nBeaulieu\u2019s big bash isn\u2019t the only anniversary celebration for Napa Valley wine this year though. Stags\u2019 Leap Winery is celebrating the 125th anniversary of the estate\u2019s first vintage from 1893. The two wineries are under the umbrella of Treasury Wine Estates, which also counts producers such as Sterling Vineyards and Beringer Vineyards among its Napa portfolio.\n\nWinemaker Christophe Paubert has had the reins at Stags\u2019 for the past decade, and a beautiful 2018 harvest neatly coincided with that anniversary. \u201cLast year was the best harvest I\u2019ve seen here,\u201d Paubert says.\n\nIt\u2019s fortuitous timing for a blockbuster release from the vintage in the years ahead, with Paubert hinting the special bottle will likely be an estate Petite Sirah. \u201cWe are one of the references in North America for Petite Sirah,\u201d Paubert says. \u201cFor people who know about it, it\u2019s a passion wine.\u201d\n\nPetite Sirah was planted on the property even before the winery was founded in 1893. Today, the Stags\u2019 estate actually has a small Petite Sirah vineyard planted in 1929, the majestically old, knotty vines growing straight up from the ground. The plot is 85% Petite Sirah, with another 16 varieties sprinkled in, and is picked together for the Ne Cede Malis Petite Sirah label. The 2016 offering was gorgeous and plush, well rounded with a mix of bright fruits and acid as well as light tannins.\n\n\u201cNe Cede Malis\u201d is a Latin phrase which translates to \u201cdon\u2019t give in to misfortune\u201d the motto of Stags\u2019 Leap founder Horace Chase. While there doesn\u2019t seem to be much misfortune to be found in a standout vintage such as 2018, it was only the year prior when the devastating wildfires rampaged through California wine country.\n\nStags\u2019 Leap Winery is celebrating the 125th anniversary of the estate\u2019s first vintage from 1893. Stags\u2019 Leap Winery\n\nThe Stags\u2019 estate was barely spared thanks to the intervention of four fire trucks as the blaze began encroaching on its property. While only a small percentage of the winery\u2019s total vineyards, the loss would have been devastating. \u201cThis is our soul,\u201d Paubert says of the estate.\n\nOf course, there are always challenges when it comes to wine. For Paubert, it\u2019s a delicate balancing act between old school tradition and the application of fine-tuned scientific practices. \u201cFor me, wine is a mix of science and the human element,\u201d Paubert says. \u201cYou can read volumes of the science of making wine, but then not know how to make wine. Ultimately, what I look for is a pure expression of the fruit.\u201d\n\nDurling balances on the same tightrope. \u201cWe pride ourselves on very traditional winemaking,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we combine that with the latest technology to really bring the best out of our vineyards, to do them the best justice.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s world of instant gratification, another tightrope to walk is to release wines that satisfy on two fronts, or two timelines\u2014being good the day they\u2019re available yet even better far down the road. \u201cThe modern winemaking challenge is figuring out how to make a wine that you can age, but that you can also enjoy right now,\u201d Durling says.\n\nMost consumers don\u2019t want to wait a decade for the wine they\u2019re buying today. Though, sometimes patience has its merits. \u201cI guarantee that you can lay this down for 50 years,\u201d Durling says of the 2016 Georges de Latour. More practically, he recommends holding off at least five years.
