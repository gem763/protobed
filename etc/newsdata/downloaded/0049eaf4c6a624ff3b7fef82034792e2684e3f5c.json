Entrepreneurs who start businesses risk their own capital, as well as their time and effort, and nobody guarantees their wages.\n\nWho is speaking up to ensure that small business owners have the continued, appropriate incentives to invest in new and existing businesses? Making it harder for them to hire upsets the risk and reward equation that is critical to starting a business and successfully staying in business.\n\n'BROKE' WORKER TURNS PATRIOTIC-THEMED FOOD TRUCK INTO NEW YORK CITY STAPLE\n\nIn fact, in municipalities like New York City that have had to deal with minimum wage increases, small businesses have been forced to cut hours and employees, raise prices and in some cases, close altogether.\n\nFor many small businesses, a new regulation can put them out of business.\n\nIt\u2019s not just wage regulation, but all regulation, that excessively impacts small business. Whether it is the calls to regulate the technology sector or bills like the new \u201cgig economy\u201d legislation out of California that are sold under the guise of \u201cbeating up on big business\u201d and being so-called worker-friendly, any regulation disproportionately hurts small business owners.\n\nIn fact, big companies secretly love regulation because regulations are in fact anti-competitive -- every new rule, law or compliance measure limits the ability of existing smaller competitors or new start-ups to compete. While big businesses can use their caches of cash to fund new people and procedures to deal with regulation, for many small businesses, a new regulation can put them out of business.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nEven the 2018 tax cuts, which gave a series of tax breaks to corporations and individuals alike, favored big businesses over small businesses. Given restrictions on the types of businesses that could use the new, lower tax rate and other nuances of the law, most small businesses did not get the same level of cuts as their larger, corporate counterparts.\n\nNot to say they didn\u2019t get any, because the majority of Americans did, but it clearly put a delineation between smaller and bigger businesses, to the small businesses\u2019 detriment.\n\nAs Dangerfield said, \u201cit\u2019s not easy bein\u2019 me\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s not easy being a small business owner. If we want to have a robust economy, we need to ensure that small businesses remain strong.\n\nIt is time that Washington remembers the little guys in business on whose shoulders the economy stands.\n\nCarol Roth is the creator of the Future File legacy planning system, \u201crecovering\u201d investment banker and host of The Roth Effect podcast.", "description": "As Dangerfield said, 'it\u2019s not easy bein\u2019 me'\u2014and it\u2019s not easy being a small business owner.", "authors": ["Carol Roth"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/Small-biz-week-pizzeria-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
