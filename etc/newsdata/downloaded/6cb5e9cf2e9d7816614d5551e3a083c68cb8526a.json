Indeed, it is a byproduct of giving humanity access to unprecedented amounts of energy.\n\nJust a century ago, life was back-breaking. Plentiful energy made better lives possible, without having to spend hours collecting firewood, polluting your household with smoke, achieving heat, cold, transportation, light, food and opportunities. Life expectancy doubled. Plentiful energy, mostly from fossil fuels, has lifted more than a billion people out of poverty in just the past 25 years.\n\nThat is not evil \u2013 it is quite the opposite.\n\nMs. Thunberg believes that climate change means people are dying, but the fact is that weather-related disasters just a century ago killed half a million people each year. Today, despite rising temperatures but because of less poverty and more resilience, droughts, floods, hurricanes and extreme temperatures kill just 20,000 people each year \u2013 a reduction of 95 per cent. That is a morally commendable achievement.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bjorn Lomborg", "Theglobeandmail.Com Opinion Article-On-Climate-Change-Humanity-Is-Not-Evil"], "top_image": ""}
