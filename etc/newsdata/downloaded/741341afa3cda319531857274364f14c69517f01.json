But there were plenty of games where I played very confidently.\"\n\nTsitsipas said his Australian Open fourth round defeat of Federer remains in his memory.\n\n\"It was one of the greatest moments of my career. Of course, the crowds love Roger - but what can you do?\n\n\"Roger understands the game very well, his serve is one of his biggest weapons and his movement and coverage help him,\" added the player who has also scored wins over Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in 2019.\n\nReilly Opelka fired 31 aces to reach the fifth semi-final of his career as he beat Roberto Bautista Agut 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nThe 37th-ranked American's victory in 93 minutes also slowed the progress of his Spanish opponent in the chase for one of the two remaining places at the ATP Finals in London next month.\n\nOpelka has reached four of his last five semi-finals this season - most recently at the start of the month in Tokyo - as the 22-year-old works to broaden his game beyond just a huge serve.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 giant earned the only title of his career last February at Long Island, New York.\n\nOpelka ended his afternoon when he set up two match points with an ace and then caught Bautista Agut wrong-footed with a winner into the empty court on his first chance.\n\nHe will next play Alex de Minaur for a place in the final after the Australian defeated Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4, 7-6 (7/4).\n\nThe 20-year-old wild card, who has trophies from Sydney, Atlanta and Zhuhai this season, dominated his opponent in one and three-quarter hours as he competes in Basel for the first time.\n\n\"You have to back yourself,\" said world No 28 De Minaur after his 31st win of the year.\n\n\"I was trying to dictate as much as I could. Things went well for me today, but my game is still a work in progress.\n\n\"It will be an incredibly tough challenge in the semis. But I'm happy I got there and I'm glad to be playing another day.\"\n\nDe Minaur has a 3-0 record over Opelka with all the wins coming this year in Sydney, Atlanta and Cincinnati.\n\nResults from the ATP tournament in Basel on Friday (x denotes seeding):\n\nQuarter-finals\n\nRoger Federer (SUI x1) bt Stan Wawrinka (SUI x7) - walkover\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas (GRE x3) bt Filip Krajinovic (SRB) 3-6, 6-4, 6-4\n\nReilly Opelka (USA) bt Roberto Bautista Agut (ESP x4) 6-3, 3-6, 6-3\n\nAlex De Minaur (AUS) bt Jan-Lennard Struff (GER) 6-4, 7-6 (7/4)", "description": "Stefanos Tsitsipas set up his fourth meeting this season with Roger Federer after a quarter-final comeback win over Filip Krajinovic at the Swiss Indoors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/9e894549d2b94f21aed6446e788a6924.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
