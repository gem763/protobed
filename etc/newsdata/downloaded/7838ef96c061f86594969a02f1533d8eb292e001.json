It\u2019s a fight between the owners of the hate-filled message board 8chan, who are trying to revive the controversial website, and the site\u2019s founder, who's doing everything in his power to keep the site \u2014 and QAnon \u2014 offline.\n\nEver since 8chan was de-platformed in August, in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting, the company that owns the site, NT Technology, has been promising to bring it back. Last week it unveiled 8kun as the successor to 8chan, and it's been trying to get its old users back on board.\n\nIn recent days, 8kun.net has briefly flickered online before disappearing again, thanks mostly to the work of 8chan founder Fredrick Brennan, who has been pressuring hosting and networking companies to drop support for the site.\n\nBrennan is clear about why he never wants 8chan and 8kun to come back online: QAnon.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I am trying to get this done, preemptively, is so that QAnon cannot come back,\u201d Brennan told VICE News from his home in the Philippines. \u201cIt is critical that 8kun does not come back at all, in any form, for any length of time.\u201d\n\nThe conspiracy theory's mysterious leader \u201cQ\u201d told his followers that his communications would never occur outside of 8chan and that 8chan was the military's chosen platform for leaking intel.\n\nSo when 8chan went offline in August, the QAnon community was left adrift. Brennan fears that if 8chan is revived as 8kun, it will allow the insidious QAnon conspiracy theories, which have been embraced by President Donald Trump\u2019s right-wing MAGA supporters, to spread online, possibly to other \u201cfree-speech\u201d platforms like Gab and Voat.\n\nQAnon supporters regularly appear at Trump\u2019s rallies, and the FBI has warned that the movement could inspire domestic terrorists.\n\n\u201cI don't want there to be any more Q drops. I think the whole Q thing is awful and should stop,\u201d Brennan said.\n\n8chan was taken offline in August because, in the wake of the El Paso Walmart shooting, web infrastructure companies like Cloudflare refused to host the website.\n\nThe man suspected of conducting the massacre in the El Paso Walmart on Aug. 3 posted a four-page rant to 8chan attempting to explain his actions. In March, the man who allegedly killed dozens of people at two New Zealand mosques posted a screed to the site just before the attack. Weeks later, the suspect in the shooting at a synagogue in Poway, California, did the same.\n\nREAD: 8chan has been taken offline again\n\nNT Technology and 8chan are owned by Jim Watkins and run by his son, Ron Watkins. Since August, they have been working to get 8chan back online, telling Congress in September that it would only reappear when he was \u201cable to develop additional tools to counter illegal content under United States law.\u201d\n\nThe name of the new site appears to be an attempt by Watkins to show he is fulfilling that promise.\n\nIn Japanese, the suffix \u201cchan\u201d typically refers to a child, while \u201ckun\u201d typically refers to a young man. However, Brennan described 8kun as \u201clipstick on the 8chan pig,\u201d saying Watkn's decision to ask all old 8chan board owners to come back shows that nothing has changed.\n\nIn a series of off-the-wall videos posted on YouTube this week, Jim Watkins said he was aiming to get the site live by Thursday, Oct. 17, but that effort failed when a UK-based provider he had been using, Zare, dropped support.\n\n\u201cWe are not willing to provide services to 8chan or 8kun,\u201d Zare spokesman Harry Beasant told VICE News. \u201cWe have had no contact with anyone called Jim Watkins. I can only assume the details used when they signed up were fake, which is why we were not aware they were on our network until informed.\u201d\n\nREAD: 8chan is back from the internet grave \u2014 and it has a new name\n\nOn Friday, NT Technology revealed a new strategy to try and get 8kun back online and keep it there.\n\nIn the early hours of Friday morning, 8kun.net came online briefly, and analysis of its traffic shows that it was being routed through the cloud computing services of Tencent and Alibaba, two of China\u2019s biggest tech companies.\n\nRon Watkins told VICE News that U.S. company VanwaTech is now providing hosting services for 8kun, and said that he had no say in where they rout the traffic to and from the site. \u201cI have no input in how they setup their routing, but it now seems to be much more robust than a few days ago.\u201d VanwaTech's CEO Nick Lim confirmed to VICE News that his company was providing services to 8kun but he was not aware of the issues surrounding 8chan.\n\nThe irony of the operators of a free-speech website using servers based in the world\u2019s most heavily-censored online spaces was not lost on Brennan.\n\n\u201cAll posts, and all IP information, everything, are going to be sent directly to the Chinese Communist Party because that is a requirement of a Chinese ISP,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nNT Technology, Alibaba and Tencent did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nREAD: The Epstein scandal is giving QAnon everything Pizzagate couldn't\n\nAs of Friday morning, 8kun.net remains inaccessible. With China\u2019s censorship apparatus likely to kick the website offline without any pressure from Brennan, it is unclear where the operators of the site can turn next.\n\nBut, as the pivot to Chinese cloud services has shown, Jim and Ron Watkins appear willing to try anything to get their website back online.\n\n\"I don't think I have ever seen it done before and I've seen a lot of different stuff, I've watched all their moves, trying to avoid deplatforming,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI've never seen them hop through China cloud computing \u2014 I guess because the idea sounds so ludicrous on its face.\u201d\n\nCover: David Reinert holding a Q sign waits in line with others to enter a campaign rally with President Donald Trump and U.S. Senate candidate Rep.
