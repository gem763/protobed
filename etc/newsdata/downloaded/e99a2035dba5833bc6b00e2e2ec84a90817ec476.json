Now a collection of those talks are being published Tuesday as The American Story: Conversations With Master Historians, by Simon & Schuster.\n\nRubenstein, 70, who was a White House staffer for President Carter and then founded the Carlyle Group, has become what he calls a \u201cpatriotic philanthropist.\u201d The billionaire has purchased rare copies of democracy\u2019s documents \u2013 the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation \u2013 and put them on public display. And he has helped finance the restoration of many of democracy\u2019s monuments, from Monticello to the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nAfter this interview with USA TODAY's Susan Page, he headed to the Jefferson Memorial to announce a $10 million gift to build an underground education center \u201cso when people go, they can actually learn about Jefferson.\u201d\n\nQuestions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: You came to Washington, by my count, eight presidents ago, and in the wake of an impeachment battle with Richard Nixon. Does today feel like that felt?\n\nRubenstein: When I came to Washington, Nixon had gone. He obviously had the challenge of the pardon, but I think there was a sense that (Gerald) Ford was trying to right the ship that had gone wrong. It was a different sort of set of circumstances. There was no Fox television. There wasn't a quite the hard-core support, the always-Trumpers. There weren\u2019t always-Nixoners. The news cycle was much different in those days. \u2026 And also I think that Nixon as a lawyer recognized certain things that a lawyer would recognize and he understood having been in government, certain traditions and certain things that you just can't not do or things that you have to do. And I think it's different today.\n\nUSA TODAY poll: Who's sticking with Trump amid troubles? His loyal base.\n\nQ: A lot of Americans feel we\u2019re now in a state of crisis, a big constitutional challenge. Do you think that\u2019s true?\n\nRubenstein: In every era, people always think this was the worst of times; this is the best of times; or this has never happened before. But the truth is, when you go back to history, we had times were much worse than this. The Civil War \u2013 I mean, the country was falling apart. In the early days of the country, with George Washington, it wasn't clear that the country was going to survive. World War II, wasn't clear what the outcome was going to be early on. So I would say this is a political crisis, but I don't think ... the country's in danger of falling apart. The country will survive whatever happens now, I think.\n\n\"The American Story,\" by David Rubenstein (Photo: Simon & Schuster)\n\nQ: Why do you think it's a political crisis?\n\nRubenstein: Well, because the two sides are at loggerheads and I don't see any easy mechanism for them to come together.\n\nQ: What's the lesson of history about how we get ourselves as a nation to a better place in our politics?\n\nRubenstein: In my view, presidents, although they are only one person, they can have an enormous impact in the country. Lincoln, Washington, Roosevelt, Wilson, Reagan \u2013 these people had a big impact. Clearly great men and great women can have a real impact on how a country goes a certain direction.\n\nQ: What are the common qualities of those successful presidents?\n\nRubenstein: You have to have some self confidence. They have some sense that they need help from other people to get something done; they can't do it all themselves. I think they have a sense that their ability to be successful depends on one thing: their ability to persuade people to follow them. Now you can impose tariffs and you can send troops overseas for some period of time, but in the end you have to persuade Congress or a court or your American people to follow you. And if you can't, then your power to get things done is very limited. In the end, most people who work in the Oval Office have a feeling that they're doing something for their country and not just for themselves.\n\n1,000 days in office: President Trump in the White House\n\nQ: How long does it take to figure out whether a president was successful or not?\n\nRubenstein: Harry Truman left the White House in January of 1953 and ... for 50-some years, people thought he was not a great, successful president. Then a book that came out about him by David McCullough had a big impact and the people began to say how tough he was and how he did things that needed to be done. Same as John Adams. He left office and for decades was not all that popular. And then again, a kind of revival.\n\nTake Jimmy Carter as a good example, my former boss. He was humiliated when he lost in 1980. He felt he let himself and American people down. For a long time, he was basically the symbol of a weak president and a terrible person. And today, 40-some years later, he's seen as a very incredible person who had many good things he did in his presidency though he didn't get reelected.\n\nTo the extent that you don't get reelected, it changes the perception of you. Interestingly, in our country, you have to run for reelection as a president and win to be considered successful.\n\nBillionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein in the new gallery, \"Records of Rights,\" named after him at the National Archives appears as a guest of USA TODAY's Capital Download, a weekly video newsmaker series.

(Photo: Shannon Rae Green, USA TODAY)\n\nQ: Fifty years from now, what will the historian of this era be saying?\n\nRubenstein: Well, it depends on what ultimately happens with President Trump. So if President Trump is not convicted, if he is reelected and if his second term turns out to be very successful, the economy continues, we stay out of wars, they might say great things. \u2018Tough the first couple of years, but look how he came back.\u2019 On the other hand, if he were to be convicted in the Senate, which there's no evidence that that'll happen now, then people will say, \u2018He was the only president ever convicted.\u2019 So it's too early to say.\n\nQ: Why did you start this series of conversations with historians for members of Congress?\n\nRubenstein: I thought, why don't I have a program where I can educate members of Congress, to the extent they want to be educated, about American history, things they might not know. Get great historians, have artifacts from the various eras that we're talking about, and then have the members come in and sit down with people from the opposite party and the opposite house in a friendly, nonpolitical setting.\n\nIt turns out that it worked. Now, the era of good feelings, as I've said, hasn't broken out. And it's not as if people aren't at each other's throats. But it's strange. It's like during the Civil War, when people would go to the area of mountains around Mount Vernon, they would not fight. They thought it was disrespectful to fight in the home of George Washington. Here, it seems like even though they are fighting all the time, when they come to these dinners, they're very peaceful. They talk to each other from the opposite party. It's like a truce has broken out.\n\nArticle II of Constitution: Trump's 'right to do whatever I want?' Or road map for impeachment?\n\nQ: What would you like to do next?\n\nRubenstein: I have four books I'm trying to get done. This was the first one. ... The next book, I hope, will be about leadership. I've excerpted all my interviews (as host of Bloomberg\u2019s The David Rubenstein Show: Peer to Peer Conversations) and focus on what people think makes a leader. Third one is a book on patriotic philanthropy \u2013 what it means, what I've tried to do. And the fourth one is a kind of autobiography that I'm calling, Sprinting to the Finish Line.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/29/david-rubenstein-american-story-conversations-with-master-historians/2496792001/", "description": "For six years, David Rubenstein has been hosting private dinners for members of Congress with master historians.
