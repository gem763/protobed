Of course, that\u2019s much easier said than done.\n\nFrom a young age, children should learn to value what others are feeling.\n\n\u201cOur kids need to appreciate other people\u2019s feelings \u2015 they\u2019ll be better friends, romantic partners and parents later,\u201d said Richard Weissbourd, a Harvard educator and co-director of the university\u2019s Making Caring Common Project.\n\nSo how can parents instill caring, fairness and basic morality in their kids?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about modeling,\u201d Weissbourd said. \u201cAlmost all kids are morally literate. They know adults have values, but moral identity is the bigger thing. When parents expect something, when parents have high moral standards, such as helping neighbors, modeling fairness, these understandings are backed up.\u201d\n\nAnd how should parents intervene when their kids do something that seems to violate the parents\u2019 values? Weissbourd adds: \u201cSay, \u2018The expectation in our family is X.\u2019 And for young kids, the Golden Rule is helpful.\u201d\n\nYobro10 via Getty Images \u201cOur kids need to appreciate other people\u2019s feelings \u2015 they\u2019ll be better friends, romantic partners and parents later,\" said Richard Weissbourd.\n\nTo get more advice from the village, as it were, we asked the HuffPost Parents Facebook audience how they instill empathy in their children. Here\u2019s what they had to say:\n\n\u201cWhen either of my boys, ages 5 and 3, impact another kid\u2019s emotions positively or negatively or if they witness another child that is sad or upset, I ask the question: \u2018How do you think they feel?\u2019 I find that getting my kids to think about and be a part of the other person\u2019s feelings, rather than just a witness to it, helps to build empathy. In the right situation (for example, at a playground and a child hurt their knee), I may also ask my kids: \u2018How can we help them?\u2019\u201d \u2015 Chris Passmore\n\nszefei via Getty Images \"It\u2019s important to always be kind or at least try,\" wrote Alyssa Anderson.\n\n\u201cHaving empathy for others is definitely a learned behavior. I started introducing it when my two children were both very young. They are one year apart and I knew I wanted to foster a lifelong friendship beyond brother and sister. Sharing toys: I would show them how happy it made the other one when they gave the toy to them. Understanding and verbally acknowledging feelings and talking about them. On the other hand, we learned boundaries and how to stop tickling each other when someone says stop.\u201d \u2015 Lindsay Brimmerman\n\n\u201cI treat my kids like human beings, the way I want to be treated. I listen to what they say, and when we disagree I\u2019ll listen to their side (I\u2019m not talking a disagreement where they refuse to drink a glass of milk, I mean the big stuff). I promise to always listen. This doesn\u2019t mean they get their way, but I will let them have their say.\u201d \u2015 Jenn LaValley\n\n\u201cWe often talk to our children about how we feel. We are open and honest about context and situations. For example, if we have a fight, once everyone is calm, we talk about how it made us feel and what we could do differently next time. We don\u2019t force conversation either \u2015 we allow our kids space if they\u2019re not ready to talk and say it\u2019s ok, we\u2019ll talk when you\u2019re ready. I think consent is really important. It shows them not to push others when they want to be left alone. Whether we are feeling positive or negative emotions, they are all valid. We allow our kids to feel angry or sad because feelings aren\u2019t always positive and that\u2019s ok. Building the emotional tool set goes a long way to developing empathy. How can we ask our kids to have empathy towards others if we don\u2019t cultivate their own understanding of their feelings? And lastly, perspective on how others are feeling. If my daughter ignores me, I\u2019ll explain to her how that makes me feel. Then I\u2019ll say how would it make her feel if she was trying to get my attention or tell me something really important and I just completely ignored her. That often makes her go \u2018Oh! That\u2019d really upset me!\u2019 We talk about how our actions affect others.\u201d \u2015 Chenoa Gao\n\n\u201cI try to empathize with them when they are having a rough moment, rather than meeting their rough moments with anger and disappointment. Often when they are having hard times, there is a reason. I try to help them identify what\u2019s really bothering them and address that. I\u2019ll never forget the day my middle daughter came home from school and was telling me they had seen a person get pulled over. The kids on the playground were speculating about why and making comments that she perceived as not so nice. She told them to stop, that he was probably sad or scared that he was pulled over. She was in first grade. I try to teach them we don\u2019t always know the situation behind things and it\u2019s important to always be kind or at least try.\u201d \u2015 Alyssa Anderson\n\nGhislain & Marie David de Lossy via Getty Images \"You don't teach empathy, you show empathy,\" said Dawn Gudel.\n\n\u201cNo tricks. Children learn by what they see and hear. You are showing empathy for others, your children will see and understand what that is. You don\u2019t teach empathy, you show empathy.\u201d \u2015 Dawn Gudel\n\n\u201cWhen you are asking your kid about their day, ask what good things happened to other people today. Did anything bad happen to someone else? How did that make them feel? Start in preschool. It helps your kid learn to celebrate the success of other people and to have empathy for someone having a hard time. Then as they get older you can discuss strategies like \u2018How can you help next time?\u2019\u201d \u2015 Beckie Grim\n\n\u201cWe use empathy as a learning tool often. When my son does something he shouldn\u2019t, I often find the only way to get through to him is to explain the same situation but it happening to him. Once I get him to describe his feelings and tie it back to what he did wrong, there is usually an \u2018aha\u2019 moment.\u201d \u2015 Kristina Mahler\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taught our little boy to be empathetic of all beings, including little bugs and birds. We encourage him to say hello and thank you to all the animals we come across, and this has transferred to the people he comes across.\u201d \u2015 Alice George\n\n\u201cWhen my children were little, we watched muted TV shows. I would ask them to tell me how they thought the characters are feeling and what could make them feel that way.\u201d \u2015 Alicia Francis Lee\n\n\u201cVerbalizing what THEY might be feeling, expressing my own feelings, pointing out how they can notice the feelings of others (like: \u2018Look at how she is sitting alone in the corner. Do you think she wants to be alone or does she want a friend? What can you do?\u2019).\u201d \u2015 Reninca Vangheel\n\n\u201cI try to keep a perspective that I\u2019ve had 24 years to learn to navigate emotions. She\u2019s had five. Listening to her is my biggest thing. I allow her to \u2018cry it out\u2019 if she needs to. I\u2019m open with her about my feelings to an extent and how events make me feel, how her actions make me feel. I shower her with praise when she does good deeds and try not to overreact when she messes up.\u201d \u2015 Emily Gerow\n\n\u201cThe thing that has seemed to make the biggest impact is by being extremely open about all feelings with everyone in the house. When someone is angry, we say it. When we are sad, we talk about it. When trying to get my almost 4-year-old to be empathetic I just talk about the raw feeling that a person might be having. Example: while watching \u2018The Grinch\u2019 we talk about how grumpy the Grinch is, but we also talk about how lonely he must be because he only has his doggy and no friends. This has transferred to other places in life, like at the park my son will talk about someone playing alone feeling lonely.\u201d \u2015 Heather Sanchez", "description": "Parents open up about how they're raising caring and empathetic children.", "authors": ["Senior Editor", "Huffpost Culture"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e0a4e210000420734312c.jpeg?cache=Lmla5HxuEO&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
