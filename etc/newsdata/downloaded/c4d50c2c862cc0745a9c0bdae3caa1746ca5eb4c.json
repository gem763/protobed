But a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey about the protests in Hong Kong led the league to immediately apologize. It\u2019s also done something that\u2019s been rare lately: united several Republican and Democratic senators.\n\nThe problem started when Morey said he stood with Hong Kong on the matter of the months-long protests in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. It caused problems for the NBA because the U.S. basketball league is hugely popular in China, and the tweet caused the Chinese Basketball Association to suspend its relationship with the Houston team.\n\nThe NBA, seemingly worried about alienating its millions of Chinese fans \u2014 and the revenue generated by the sport\u2019s popularity there \u2014 apologized. It said the tweet was \u201cregrettable,\u201d and Morey deleted the post and apologized, saying, \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China, I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nBut several U.S. politicians from both sides of the aisle are saying the NBA should not be apologizing to China.\n\nBen Sasse, a Republican senator from Nebraska, released a statement calling the NBA\u2019s \u201capology to the Chinese Communist Party\u201d shameful, adding, \u201cBasketball fans and the American people more broadly should have absolutely no doubt about what is happening here: The NBA wants money, and the Communist Party of China is asking them to deny the most basic of human rights. In response, the NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.\u201d\n\nChuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, said, \u201cNo one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom. I stand with the people of Hong Kong in their pursuit of democratic rights.\u201d\n\nNo one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom.\n\n\n\nI stand with the people of Hong Kong in their pursuit of democratic rights.\n\n\n\nI stand with Americans who want to voice their support for the people of Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nUnacceptablehttps://t.co/5B5KMGZujh \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 7, 2019\n\nSimilarly, Tim Scott, a Republican senator from South Carolina, said, \u201cSince when did we need the Communist Party of China\u2019s approval to have an opinion?\u201d\n\nSince when did we need the Communist Party of China\u2019s approval to have an opinion? It\u2019s a sad day when Americans can\u2019t come out in support of freedom & democracy without fear of retaliation.

Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said, \u201cWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said, \u201cThe NBA is wrong: we ought to support brave Hong Kongers struggling for freedom, not their Chinese communist oppressors.\u201d\n\n.@dmorey is right & @NBA is wrong: we ought to support brave Hong Kongers struggling for freedom, not their Chinese communist oppressors. @NBA, don\u2019t be the capitalists who will sell the rope used to hang you. \u2014 Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) October 7, 2019\n\nAnd Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, said, \u201cI thought the @NBA was proud to be the \u2018wokest professional sports league\u2019? I guess that only applies to speaking out on American politics & social issues.\u201d\n\nI thought the @NBA was proud to be the \u201cwokest professional sports league\u201d?\n\n\n\nI guess that only applies to speaking out on American politics & social issues. https://t.co/iS7uhqIAfA \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\nStay tuned to see how the NBA handles this situation in the coming days.", "description": "Senators Ted Cruz and Chuck Schumer are both upset with the NBA for \u2018implementing a gag rule on Americans.\u2019", "authors": ["Steven Kutz", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS775_ap_roc_ZG_20191007093536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
