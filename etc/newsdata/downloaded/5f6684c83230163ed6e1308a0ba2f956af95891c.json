I walked around it and then crawled across like an old person, like across the difficult bits.\n\nBad luck: The BGT host admitted she was 'showing off' and has had to undergo emergency surgery and have a metal plate fitted after breaking her leg in two places\n\n'And then there were these three inflatable stepping stones in the middle of the sea and everyone else was running across it and I thought \"oh I could do that, if kids can do it I can do it\" and I did it and I made it.'\n\nHolding her hands up, she said: 'I was showing off Jamie \u2013 I made it across to the other side and then my leg slipped coz obviously its wet and it went the other way and I felt it break.\n\n'I fell in to the sea and I had to swim back to the shore one legged. I\u2019ve broken it in two places, I\u2019ve broken my fibula in two places.\n\n'I was rushed to hospital and I\u2019ve got a metal plate and screws in my leg which currently is the fastest and easiest way for it to heal. I haven\u2019t got a cast I\u2019ve got like metal in my leg and a splint and it\u2019s all wrapped up and it\u2019s got a heartbeat in it.'\n\nFamily: Amanda was with her daughters Alexa, 13, and Hollie, seven and husband Chris Hughes when she snapped her fibula in two places and had to be rushed to a local hospital\n\nShe continued: 'The irony is is you know how much I hate health and safety and a guy that was running the thing said \"you have to wear the life jacket\".\n\n'I was thinking well this is silly, it\u2019s a children\u2019s thing so I was like \"ugh alright then\" and I put on the life jacket I\u2019m really glad I did to be honest because I don\u2019t think I would have made it back as hastily as I did.'\n\nJamie asked her if she is mobile and she said: 'I am on crutches and I am in a wheelchair and Chris bless him has pushed me to dinner every night in a wheelchair.'\n\nHave some heart: Amanda called in from her holiday to tell Jamie Theakston (right) exactly what had happened\n\nAmanda was with daughters Alexa, 13, and Hollie, seven, and husband Chris Hughes when the incident occured.\n\nAmanda also told MailOnline earlier: 'Sadly this is true.

She slipped and snapped her fibula in two places.'\n\nAmanda reportedly landed a \u00a33million contract to host the Heart Radio Breakfast Show.\n\nBut it was her youngest daughter Hollie, who stole the show when she interviewed Hollywood A-listers Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning recently.\n\nAmanda said she was 'worried for her job' as Hollie made her interview debut with the Maleficent: Mistress of Evil stars.\n\nThe presenter shared a sweet group snap of herself and Hollie posing with Angelina, 44, and Elle, 21, that she captioned: 'I\u2019m worried for my job!! [Hollie]is a natural!'\n\nA spokesperson for Amanda added: 'Despite this painful accident it's business as usual for Amanda and she will return to Heart Breakfast on Monday 28th October'\n\nAmanda said to the actresses: 'The film is very much about family and how we don\u2019t have to kind of be built in the same way in order to be united and again, I just think this film is so full of amazing positive messages for younger people.\n\n'How important is it for you to play roles that kind of, and not in a sort of heavy way, but kind of really gently give a lovely message to young people?'\n\nAngelina responded: 'Oh absolutely, especially when you know that a large part of the audience are young.\n\n'I think usually it\u2019s the adults that need to be reminded of these messages because you guys kind of already know, but it\u2019s really important to strengthen these messages for the young.'\n\nDiscussing her six children - of which three are adopted - she added: 'And the message that family\u2019s not just blood you know. Half of my children are not my blood and they are absolutely my family and my children and I love them so much.'\n\nCute: Amanda's youngest daughter Hollie stole the show when she interviewed Hollywood A-listers Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning on Heart Radio recently\n\nAmanda's accident comes after she recently had an online spat with a tile company.\n\nA furious Amanda took to Twitter to deny she's a 'princess' after engaging in a spat with a tile company called Appleby's tiles.\n\nThe radio host hit back after a representative for the company called Jack, who accused her of using her 'celebrity status' to get 'special treatment' after she asked for a refund when she was sent an incorrect box of tiles\n\nAmanda explained that she would now be out of pocket as she already had tilers on site which she had to pay, but Appleby's tiles refused to give her the tiles for free by way of compensation.\n\nThey wrote to her: 'Unfortunately that is not how it works. We will not be refunding your order however, we can refund your shipping fees.\n\n'Alternatively, we can refund your whole order for you and not send these out.\n\n'Unfortunately we do not make exceptions for 'celebrity' status and all of our customers are treated the same as per our terms and conditions. We will happily refund you your shipping for the inconvenience.'\n\nMailOnline has seen the full transcript between Amanda and Appleby's tiles (sent by Appleby's) and it's clear that Amanda does not use her celebrity status to get special treatment.\n\nA spokesperson for Amanda told MailOnline: 'She just wanted to return them and have the correct ones sent.'\n\nCalling them out: Amanda shared some of the exchange on Twitter - MailOnline has read the full transcript and at no point did she use her celebrity status to get special treatment", "description": "Amanda Holden revealed she is 'totally gutted' after breaking her leg in two places while 'showing off' on an inflatable assault course on day one of her family holiday.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lawrence For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/09/20027248-0-image-a-28_1571734521049.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
