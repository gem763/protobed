The fractures of class and belief have inspired many well-meaning and systematic attempts to address them. The United States is host to a large \u201ccivil dialogue\u201d movement, complete with membership organizations and inspirational tracts, devoted to helping us understand one another better. Gladwell has always seemed bored by politics\u2014it\u2019s one of his most appealing traits as a public figure\u2014and in the new book, he wants to frog-jump our pettier divisions and take his readers back to the wellsprings of social relations, wellsprings that have been poisoned by a set of presumptions he wants us to correct. The sooner the better.\n\nThe frame for the book, appearing at the beginning and reprised at the end, is the story of Sandra Bland, who was pointlessly jailed after a routine traffic stop in Prairie View, Texas, in 2015. She committed suicide in her cell three days later. The conversation between the arresting officer and Bland, recorded on police radio, went viral on YouTube.\n\n\u201cTalking to Strangers,\u201d the author writes, \u201cis an attempt to understand what really happened\u201d when the policeman pulled Bland over. On one level, of course, we already know what happened\u2014we\u2019ve got the police recording. Gladwell wants to go deeper. The tragedy of Sandra Bland is that she and the policeman were strangers to each other, unable to bridge a social divide. Usually, Gladwell writes, \u201cwe put aside these controversies after a decent interval and move on to other things.\u201d But not him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to move on to other things.\u201d\n\nThen he moves on to other things: the first meeting between Cort\u00e9s and Montezuma in the 16th century, Adolf Hitler\u2019s snow job of Neville Chamberlain, a sneaky Cuban spy who embedded herself in the upper ranks of the Pentagon, Jerry Sandusky and his enablers, Bernie Madoff and his pigeons, the suicides of the poets Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath, and many more. Each of these unhappy episodes, Gladwell writes, was caused by the faulty \u201ctranslation strategies\u201d used by the men and women involved. \u201cTalking to Strangers,\u201d he says, \u201cis about why we are so bad at that act of translation.\u201d\n\nRead: If legal marijuana leads to murder, what\u2019s up in the Netherlands?\n\nLike Lewis Carroll\u2019s Walrus, then, Gladwell thinks the time has come to talk of many things. Too many, in fact. His millions of admiring readers often treat Gladwell\u2019s books as the high-journalism version of Bond or Bourne movies, breakneck adventures that take us on a tour of exotic intellectual locales. He introduces us to historical oddities, revisionist interpretations of the past, the frontiers of social science, the backstories behind recent headlines, all strung together along a single provocative thesis.\n\nIn Talking to Strangers, however, the thesis never emerges. Instead he leads us into culs-de-sac that even so smooth a talker as Malcolm Gladwell can\u2019t charm his way out of. The opening chapters of the book are devoted to what he calls two great \u201cpuzzles.\u201d The first puzzle is, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we tell when the stranger in front of us is lying to our face?\u201d To illustrate the point, he describes the success of a large network of spies that Castro\u2019s Cuba managed to establish throughout the Western world, fooling even the most battle-tested U.S. intelligence officers.", "description": "After 20 years, has the author\u2019s formula at last been exhausted?", "authors": ["Andrew Ferguson", "Staff Writer For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_17310256131064/facebook.jpg?1568124767", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
