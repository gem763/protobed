REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi\n\nAs his unlicensed news channel broadcasts footage of him doling out aid to the poor, Karoui, 56, is campaigning from behind bars, denying accusations he attributes to political chicanery.\n\nWith Tunisia holding only its third free vote since its 2011 revolution, Karoui\u2019s candidacy has raised questions over what role money and the media should play, and brought accusations that the government is interfering with the judicial process.\n\nIf he beats the 25 other candidates to the presidency, but is then convicted and barred from office, it could prompt outrage among his voters - and a political crisis in Tunisia.\n\nHowever, with the first round of voting this Sunday, and a second round due in October or November, no date has yet been set for a verdict that would declare him guilty or innocent, though a lesser hearing on Friday may release him for now.\n\nRecent opinion polls put Karoui ahead of the other candidates who include liberal Prime Minister Youssef Chahed and the moderate Islamist Ennahda party\u2019s Abdelfattah Mourou.\n\nChahed rarely mentions Karoui by name, but says his own campaign is aimed at combating \u201cmedia mafia\u201d and \u201cadventurers who threaten the democratic transition\u201d.\n\nMany in the political establishment see Karoui as a populist illicitly using his TV station and charity for political gain.\n\nKaroui\u2019s allies in turn paint his arrest and other moves that threatened to curb his influence as part of an undemocratic conspiracy to keep him from office and marginalise poorer Tunisians they say he champions.\n\nLocal and foreign election monitoring groups have complained that he was unable to take part in a recent televised debate, arguing that it breached his right to speak to voters on equal terms with rivals.\n\nINTIMIDATION\n\nThe arguments over his candidacy were on full view in the impoverished Kabariya district of Tunis this week, when a small group of youths threatened Karoui supporters handing out leaflets, forcing them to scramble back into their cars.\n\nSamira Chaouachi, a Karoui campaign officer, said the intimidation of his volunteers in Kabariya showed he was being targeted by powerful forces.\n\nHis arrest, a run-in with the media regulator and an ultimately unsuccessful parliamentary bill that would have kept him from running, were also evidence of a campaign against him, Chaouachi said, blaming the prime minister.\n\nChahed and other government officials have said Karoui\u2019s arrest was a purely judicial decision and that the government had no part in decisions taken by the independent media regulator.\n\nThe Kabariya incident took place in a wasteland where groups of children were playing amid piles of garbage prowled by street dogs, and where several residents had earlier said they planned to vote for him.\n\n\u201cNobody cares for us. Nabil Karoui is the only one to help Kabariya. All Kabariya will vote for him,\u201d said Mohammed Ali, a casual labourer in black t-shirt and jeans.\n\nA woman, who did not give her name but said she planned to vote for Karoui based on his charity\u2019s largesse there, added simply: \u201cI\u2019ll vote for whoever pays me.\u201d\n\nPlenty of poorer Tunisians are not sold on Karoui, however. \u201cWe are not stupid. We are poor, but he cannot buy us with his money,\u201d said Habiba Riahi, 41, a teacher standing in a Tunis shop.\n\nKaroui had built a media company with his brother before the revolution, but rose to prominence after it as his Nesma TV backed secular parties against the moderate Islamist Ennahda, helping them win elections in 2014.\n\nHis national popularity, however, is based on the charity he founded in 2016 to combat poverty, which he named for a son who died in a road crash, and on his television station\u2019s news programme.\n\nIt combines critical coverage of the government with reports about Karoui\u2019s own philanthropy, showing him visiting forgotten parts of Tunisia to give food, bedding and blankets to the poor.\n\nThe media regulator ordered it taken off air, leading to a police raid on its headquarters, which the channel said was aimed to silence a critical voice. It continues to broadcast, still without a licence.\n\nIt set the stage for another battle as parliament passed an amendment to the electoral law to stop candidates benefiting from charitable associations or foreign funding in the year before an election.\n\nBut President Beji Caid Essebsi died in July without signing it into law, meaning Karoui was able to run. He had described parliament\u2019s vote as \u201ca strong setback to nascent democracy\u201d, saying it was \u201cdedicated to my exclusion\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, his team continue their campaign and Nesma still broadcasts continual footage of Karoui bringing succour to the poor.", "description": "Media magnate Nabil Karoui's run for president was testing the rules of Tunisia's young democracy even before he was put in custody last month charged with tax fraud and money laundering.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Angus Mcdowall", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428982684&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0FN-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
