Here's what we spend in a typical week.", "language": "en", "text": "My wife and I both work in IT and make a combined annual pretax income of about $160,000. We're based in St. Ann, Missouri, a municipality in the St. Louis area.\n\nWe also work on other things besides our full-time jobs, such as my blog and my wife's guitar-flipping business. We make an extra $2,000 to $4,000 a month with these side hustles, before taxes.\n\nMy wife and I have 13 years between us \u2014 I just turned 30 and she is 43. We are working towards structuring our life away from the corporate grind, building up passive streams of income and working on our side businesses to become financially free without a reason to need our corporate jobs anymore.\n\nWe don't have any kids but we do have five cats, two dogs, and a couple of tarantulas (OK, we have eight ... we aren't tarantula hoarders, I swear). One of our dogs, Penny, is elderly and going blind, while two of our cats are special needs, so our vet bills end up being a bit higher than most other people's.\n\nIf all goes as planned in the next five years, we'll be able to leave our corporate jobs. We won't stop working completely \u2014 we'll just be working on what matters to us. There is one thing we will miss when we leave our jobs, though, and that is the more affordable health insurance and the nice retirement match!", "description": "Daniella Flores and her wife Alexandra live in St. Louis, Missouri, and both work in IT.
