The DOJ claims that things took a sinister turn when two Seattle startup execs visited Nerayoff for meetings at his house, in New York, in March 2018.\n\nIt's prior to this meeting that Nerayoff introduced Hlady to the start-up as an \"operations guy,\" describing him as a former member of the Irish Republican Army, the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and a man who was shot at and also killed people.\n\nPer the DOJ indictment:\n\nDue to a snowstorm, Jane Doe was unable depart New York on a flight as scheduled. Instead, Jane Doe stayed at NERAYOFF's house on the evening of March 21, 2018, and through March 22, 2018. In the middle of the night, on approximately March 22, 2018, the defendant MICHAEL HLADY walked into the room where Jane Doe was sleeping by herself. HLADY turned on the lights, pulled up a chair to the bed where Jane Doe had been sleeping and told Jane Doe, in sum and substance, that if Company 1 did not agree to his demands, which included, among other things, a demand for $10,000,000 and a large amount of Company 1 tokens, then \"we will crush you,\" by, among other things, driving down the price of Company 1's tokens. At some point later that night, the defendant STEVEN NERAYOFF also entered the room. He told Jane Doe, in sum and substance, that he would destroy her and Company 1, but that he did not want to, and asked Jane Doe if she wanted to, in sum and substance, thrive or be destroyed. Shortly thereafter, NERAYOFF and HLADY demanded that Company 1 provide a purported 10,000 ETH loan to NERAYOFF.\n\nAfter the incident in the middle of the night, the DOJ claims that Hlady continued to threaten the startup exec using iMessages.\n\nAll of this was eventually too much, and the startup's execs eventually gave in and forwarded 10,000 ETH as a loan to the two Alchemist execs, which the two later refused to pay back. The loan was worth approximately $4.45 million at the time.\n\nIn the following months, the DOJ claims that Nerayoff and Hlady followed through with other threats, in an attempt to acquire the Seattle startup. However, these never materialized.\n\nThe startup eventually went to authorities, and the two were arrested and arraigned in court yesterday. If found guilty, the two Alchemist execs face up to 20 years in prison, each.\n\nThe trial will likely be one of the most high-profile cases in the cryptocurrency world as Nerayoff is one of the most well-known figures in the Ethereum scene and one of the cryptocurrency's earliest backers.", "description": "DOJ claims the consultants threatened to destroy a startup's ICO unless they got more money.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/11/b238c673-98ce-4cec-bfde-69be7b63e00c/thumbnail/770x578/3a0fc5a51ce59f76aba9d3165a948ab6/ethereum.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
