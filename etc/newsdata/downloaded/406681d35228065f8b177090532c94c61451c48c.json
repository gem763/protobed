REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nPhilip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, testified on Saturday before three Democratic-led House of Representatives panels conducting an inquiry into whether to impeach Trump.\n\nThe source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Reeker was prepared to tell the committees in the closed-door session he had largely left Ukraine policy to Kurt Volker, then the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, and to others.\n\nReeker took up his post on March 18, overseeing diplomacy in 50 nations including Russia and Ukraine, as then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch faced public criticism including the allegation, which she and the department denied, that she gave a Ukrainian official a list of people not to prosecute.\n\nThe source said Reeker sought a stronger State Department defence of Yovanovitch - who was brought back early from her post in May - under U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s name, but this appeared to have been stymied \u201cfrom the top,\u201d though it was not clear if Pompeo himself had objected.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate a domestic political rival, Joe Biden, the former vice president who is a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to face Trump in 2020.\n\nThe Republican president this year withheld $391 million in security aid to Ukraine that had been approved by Congress.\n\nDuring a July 25 call at the heart of the inquiry, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as \u201ca favour\u201d to look into a claim - debunked as a conspiracy theory - that a Democratic National Committee computer server was in Ukraine.\n\nThe unsubstantiated theory could buttress Trump\u2019s scepticism of U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help him against Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump also asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, who had served as a director for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nIn the call, Zelenskiy agreed to conduct the investigations. The U.S. aid was released in mid-September.\n\nTrump and other U.S. officials have denied for weeks that they had demanded a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d - a Latin phrase meaning a favour for a favour - for delivering the U.S. aid.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney on Oct. 17 said Trump\u2019s withholding the aid was linked to his request that the Ukrainians look into the claims about the Democrats\u2019 server.\n\nThe source said Reeker was unaware in the June-August period of the possibility Trump may have withheld the aid or a meeting to pressure Zelenskiy to carry out the investigations.\n\nReeker knew the aid was being delayed, the source said, but not why and largely left policy toward Ukraine to Volker, to Charge d\u2019Affaires at the U.S. embassy in Kiev Ambassador William Taylor, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state.\n\nAll four have already testified in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn his testimony, Taylor said by mid-July \u201cit was becoming clear to me that the (White House) meeting President Zelenskiy wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nHe testified that he was alarmed when he later heard security aid, not just a meeting, was conditioned on the investigations.\n\nHowever, the source said that Reeker, a veteran career U.S. diplomat, was largely out of the loop on policy toward Ukraine.\n\n\u201cHe knew that Volker and Sondland and Kent were on top of this and were dealing with it on the day to day and he just wasn\u2019t,\u201d said the source. \u201cHis take on this was ... he should let those people do their job.\u201d\n\nHowever, the source said Reeker tried to get the agency to issue a stauncher defence of Yovanovitch. In March, the agency said allegations she provided a list of people not to prosecute \u201care not true and are intended to tarnish (her) reputation.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch was recalled early despite being told she had done nothing wrong, partly because of attacks on her, including by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has told Reuters he provided information to both Trump and the State Department.\n\nThe source said Reeker tried to get the agency to issue a stronger defence in Pompeo\u2019s name but the final statement was \u201cweaker than some folks in the department, including Phil, wanted.\u201d", "description": "The top U.S. diplomat for Europe did not know U.S. security aid may have been withheld to pressure Ukraine's new president to conduct investigations politically helpful to U.S. President Donald Trump, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.", "authors": ["Arshad Mohammed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445297836&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0MG", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
