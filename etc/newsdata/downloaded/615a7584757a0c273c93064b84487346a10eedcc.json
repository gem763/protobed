He has already been sacked 24 times this season, with only Marcus Mariota and Jameis Winston on the receiving end of more coming into Week Eight.\n\nInjuries have played a part, with Dalton made to face an imposing Jacksonville defence last week without starting left tackle Andre Smith and right guard John Miller, who missed the game with respective ankle and groin injuries, while Cordy Glenn was also absent due to a one-game suspension.\n\nThe Bengals have also been without highly-rated rookie offensive tackle Jonah Williams, the team\u2019s first-round pick in the 2019 Draft, after he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury during pre-season minicamp in June.\n\nAnd Anderson says the importance of having a strong offensive line cannot be underestimated.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe strength of the offensive line impacts everything,\u201d explains 70-year-old Anderson, who spent his entire 16-year playing career with the Bengals and led the franchise to its first Super Bowl in the 1981 season.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of success early in my career - we did very well and went to the playoffs twice in the mid-70s. Then the offensive line started to go down and my career went down too - they were just about ready to run me out of Cincinnati!\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for Andy, but there were times I started seeing ghosts and you get situations where there\u2019s no pressure but you\u2019re expecting it, and other times when you\u2019re looking for pressure instead of focusing on other things.\n\n\u201cI developed a lot of bad mechanics, but when the offensive line solidified after we drafted Hall of Fame left tackle Anthony Munoz in 1980, my mechanics came back and I was able to turn things around.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOne positive for Dalton is that star wide receiver AJ Green is on verge making a return to add to the Bengals' options through the air.\n\nThe seven-time Pro Bowler has yet to feature this season after hurting his ankle in training camp and, although an appearance at Wembley looks unlikely, Anderson is confident Green's return will create more opportunities for Dalton and the rest of the offence.\n\n\u201cAJ Green was always their big-play receiver. If people want to try and take him out the game, it opens things up for everyone else \u2013 for the tight ends, as well as Auden Tate and Tyler Boyd,\" he says.\n\n\u201cIt also takes an extra guy out of the box for the running game \u2013 so all of a sudden Joe Mixon can run the ball more effectively.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAlthough the current indications are that Dalton is not at risk of losing his starting spot to back-up Ryan Finley, recent displays can\u2019t help but raise questions over his future with the franchise beyond the end of the year.\n\nHis current deal does not expire until the end of the 2020 season, but the Bengals can cut him at any time without taking a cap hit.\n\nAnd with next year\u2019s Draft set to offer up a wealth of quarterback talent including Oklahoma\u2019s Jalen Hurts, Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Herbert out of Oregon, Cincinnati could have a big decision to make on the direction of their offence.\n\nA spot in the playoffs may already be out of reach for the Bengals, but Dalton\u2019s remaining performances \u2013 starting with Sunday\u2019s meeting with the Rams - could prove crucial in determining whether he is still starting for Taylor\u2019s side in 12 months.\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\n\u201cI always tell people to be careful what they wish for,\u201d adds Anderson, whose franchise record of 197 passing touchdowns can be eclipsed by Dalton with two scores at Wembley.\n\n\u201cYou may not want Dalton as your quarterback but who are you going to find who\u2019s better?\n\n\u201cGood quarterbacks in the NFL are a rare commodity and I think we\u2019ve got a pretty good one \u2013 I would like to see him stay.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback and coach Ken Anderson on why Dalton is still the right man for the job as NFL returns to Wembley", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Bettmann Archive", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733787.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NFL-Jacksonville-Jaguars-at-Cincinnati-Bengals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
