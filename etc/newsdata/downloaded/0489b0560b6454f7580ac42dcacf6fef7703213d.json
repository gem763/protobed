REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nSelected by Moon to lead the ministry, Cho Kuk had been tasked with reforming the prosecutors\u2019 office, which critics say has long been susceptible to political pressure.\n\nSince his appointment on Sept.9 there have been street protests against Cho, due to investigations mounted by prosecutors into his family\u2019s financial investments and the university admissions of his children.\n\n\u201cI decided I must not burden the President and the government with my family\u2019s affairs anymore,\u201d Cho said in a statement announcing his resignation.\n\n\u201cI believe that now is the time for me to step down so that reforming the prosecutor\u2019s office will be successfully completed,\u201d he added.\n\nCho\u2019s decision to quit was his own, Moon\u2019s chief political advisor Kang Gi-jung told reporters.\n\n\u201cI am very sorry for causing so much conflict among the people,\u201d Moon said in a meeting with senior aides on Monday, referring to the protests.\n\n\u201cBut... Minister Cho Kuk\u2019s passionate commitment to prosecution reform, and his attitude to endure all kinds of difficulties for it, once again aroused sympathy for the urgency of prosecution reform.\u201d\n\nThe controversy over Cho, as well as public discontent over a sluggish economy and stalled diplomatic efforts with North Korea, have pushed Moon\u2019s approval ratings to fresh lows.\n\nIn its latest survey, pollster Realmeter said 41.4% approved of Moon\u2019s performance, the lowest since he took office in 2017.\n\nThe survey of 2,502 people conducted last week found 56.1% disapproved of his performance, up from 52.3% in the first week of October, the pollster said on Monday.\n\nCho had attended a news conference earlier on Monday where he released details of proposed reforms to the prosecutor\u2019s office, such as closing some powerful investigative units accused by critics of operating without proper oversight.", "description": "South Korea's recently appointed justice minister resigned on Monday saying a graft scandal swirling around his family had become a political burden for President Moon Jae-in's government.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440661988&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0CN", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
