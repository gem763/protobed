We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d News reports also pointed out that the president said something false, though that hardly qualifies as news anymore.\n\nYet Trump has raged about it in tweets over four days, most recently Thursday morning. In the most bizarre moment, Trump displayed a chart at the White House on Wednesday in which someone\u2014it is not clear who\u2014appears to have graffitied a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chart with a Sharpie, in order to suggest that the storm might have been headed toward Alabama. Asked about the alteration, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d using much the same tone that a toddler uses when asked who broke the lamp.\n\nHow was this futile? Let us count the ways. First, the scribble on the map fooled absolutely no one, bearing no resemblance to the high-detail rendering around it. Second, the predictions about Dorian\u2019s path have changed dramatically since Trump\u2019s initial statement about Alabama, rendering the entire controversy moot. Third, the chart he displayed was from last Thursday, three days before he offered a warning based on information that \u201cjust came up\u201d; by the time Trump spoke on Sunday, the five-day forecast showed the storm curving out into the Atlantic off the coast of North Carolina. Fourth, there\u2019s no reason to believe that Trump\u2019s comments on Sunday were anything more than his typical bullshitting: He knew the storm was going to hit the South, he knows Alabama is a southern state, and it\u2019s important to him electorally, so he rambled on. While there\u2019s no reason to believe the initial statement was anything other than an unintentional error, it\u2019s unclear at this point whether Trump now believes his own lie or recognizes it and just won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s also unclear which would be worse.\n\nTrump has no reputation for probity to maintain, and he could easily drop the matter. But he won\u2019t, pursuing ever more absurd protestations and excuses. He has tweeted out an old spaghetti plot that purports to show the path of the hurricane going over Alabama, even though (1) none of the government\u2019s models actually predicted it would, (2) the chart was out of date by Trump\u2019s Sunday briefing, and (3) once again, the NWS said it was untrue. If reality doesn\u2019t conform to the president\u2019s words, reality must be adjusted with a Sharpie.\n\nOne fears belaboring the point. Trump\u2019s lies about Alabama here are so silly as to forfeit close consideration, yet so bizarre as to invite puzzled scrutiny. (It is refreshing to know that he can still say something so outrageously, blatantly untrue that it shocks.)", "description": "The president keeps insisting that Hurricane Dorian was forecast to hit Alabama.", "authors": ["David A.
