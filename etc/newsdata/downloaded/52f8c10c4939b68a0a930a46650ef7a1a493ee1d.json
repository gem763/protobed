I\u2019ve said the bar is too high. But Manchester United don\u2019t care.\n\n'Jurgen Klopp\u2019s absolutely livid. I think he\u2019ll also be livid with his team, because his team haven\u2019t started this game and they\u2019ve got what they deserve somewhat.'\n\nFormer Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher added: 'You want it to work, you want it to be good for the game. But there\u2019s no doubt with the credibility of VAR that they\u2019re leaving themselves open to being criticised. A foul\u2019s a foul.'\n\nAfter VAR was consulted, referee Martin Atkinson confirmed Marcus Rashford's goal stood\n\nAfter much deliberation, a decision was finally made, with United's goal allowed to stand\n\nMany observers criticised the decision to allow Rashford's goal to stand vs Liverpool\n\nMarcus Rashford celebrates following his goal for United, which was subject to a VAR check\n\nGraeme Souness was adamant that it was a foul. He said: 'I think Lindelof catches him. Any way you look at it, it\u2019s a foul. There\u2019s definite contact with the player, and it\u2019s a foul.\n\n'He\u2019s gone through the back of someone. He\u2019s been kicked below his left knee. You kick someone from behind, it\u2019s a foul. It\u2019s not up for discussion.'\n\nPiers Morgan was heavily critical of VAR. He tweeted: 'United's goal came after a clear foul on Origi.\n\n'Liverpool's disallowed goal came after an accidental use of an arm by Mane.\n\n'VAR doesn't just suck the life & passion out of football - it's almost invariably wrong too. Get rid of it.'\n\nAnother Twitter user added: '... there was contact. Lindelof caught Origi. It was a foul any day.'\n\nHowever, another user disagreed, writing: 'The slightest of touches from Lindelof on Origi, if his touch didn't go straight to Mctominay he doesn't throw himself on the floor like that. Not a foul. Good goal.'\n\nAnother criticised VAR, tweeting: 'VAR is pretty pathetic, even as a Man United fan I can see that Lindelof fouled Divock Origi, VAR is absolutely terrible and I\u2019ve said this all season.'\n\n... there was contact.

That\u2019s a goal that would have been given before.\n\nLiverpool had a goal ruled out shortly afterwards as Sadio Mane was deemed to have handled\n\nAfter VAR was consulted, it was deemed that Liverpool forward Mane handled the ball\n\nMane's goal being ruled out only served to increase the frustration of Liverpool boss Klopp\n\n'It was handball, it should have been a goal. We can disagree with VAR and have talking points, but that was the reason VAR\u2019s been brought in.'\n\nHowever, Mane's goal being disallowed only served to anger Klopp even further.\n\nNeville said: 'This has got the feeling of that Arsenal game, the 50th game when you just get the crowd up, things are happening. It will be mayhem, this ground in the second half.'\n\nRoy Keane added: 'It does catch his hand (Mane\u2019s goal ruled out). You need a few breaks in this game, and maybe they\u2019ve earned it.'\n\nSouness also commented on the incident, saying: 'They\u2019ve deserved it, and there\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s a foul (handball). Can United sustain those effort levels? I would doubt they could maintain those levels of pressing in the second half.'\n\nOne Twitter user wrote: 'Everyone complaining about the mane goal getting disallowed but if it didn\u2019t hit his hand the ball would of gone away from him from the angle he touched it down.'\n\nAnother added: 'The disallowed Mane goal is the very reason #VAR brought in. Not disallowing the Utd goal makes it look stupid but then again the decision makes Atkinson look stupid and incompetent aswell.'\n\nEveryone complaining about the mane goal getting disallowed but if it didn\u2019t hit his hand the ball would of gone away from him from the angle he touched it down \u2014 Joe Millward (@KingMillward) October 20, 2019", "description": "Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was left furious after Marcus Rashford's strike for Manchester United was allowed to stand but Sadio Mane's effort was ruled out for handball by VAR just minutes later.", "authors": ["Jeorge Bird For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/17/19960348-0-image-a-62_1571589872218.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
