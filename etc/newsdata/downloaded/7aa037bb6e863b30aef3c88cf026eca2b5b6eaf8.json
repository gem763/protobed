They said: 'That's going to be two hours and this is going to be the end of the matter.'\n\n\"After two hours, the lorry didn't move and then people started coughing and started freezing.\n\n\"This is when you have to knock and knock and knock and be at the mercy of the smugglers to come and get you out.\n\n\"Because it's all locked from outside.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nAhmad said he was one of the lucky ones that made it alive when he and other migrants 'were stuck nearly to death'.\n\nHe also stressed that the most difficult and dangerous part of the journey was in Calais, France, due to the high criminal activity around the area.\n\n\"Smugglers would be just putting people in the back of lorries and just sending them off, not knowing where they were headed,\" he added.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHe tweeted yesterday following the news and said: \"My heart goes out to those who lost their lives en route. Be kind, be the voices of the voiceless.
