They admitted putting lives at risk by driving either shortly after having a drink or on the following morning. A fifth of drivers overall took the same risk in the last 12 months \u2013 equating to more than seven million motorists, the RAC's report on motoring found. Some 23 per cent admitted that they drove after a small alcoholic drink. A lack of traffic officers and a dramatic fall in roadside breathalyser tests means drivers think they can get away with drink-driving, warn the RAC and AA.\n\nThe survey of 1,753 motorists also found only 15 per cent are following Government advice to keep their phones in their glove compartment \u2013 with 25 per cent keeping it on the seat or dashboard.\n\nA quarter of motorists (24 per cent) also admitted keeping their phone's sound switched on \u2013 leaving them vulnerable to dangerous distractions.\n\nCampaigners and MPs warn that declining numbers of police in cars risks undermining the crackdown on phone use at the wheel.\n\nThe number of traffic officers in England and Wales has plummeted by almost 30 per cent in ten years \u2013 from 3,766 in 2007 to 2,643 in 2017.\n\nThey blame traffic jam-induced boredom for the epidemic.\n\nThe volume of traffic on Britain's roads rose by 6.5 per cent in the last ten years, according to the Department for Transport.\n\nTim Rogers, of staff representative body the Police Federation, said: 'Often they're doing it in traffic, but inattention at any speed is lethal. These people will say they rarely see police on the roads, that they've never been stopped by police, so they perceive no risk in doing it.'\n\nThe volume of traffic on Britain's roads rose by 6.5 per cent in the last ten years which has contributed to the traffic jam-induced boredom\n\nHe added: 'There's also a problem with chief constables who cut dedicated traffic officers then claim 'all our officers are traffic cops'.\n\nThe reality is they're not. They don't have the specific training and resources to enforce traffic offences.\n\nRoad rage on rise Road rage incidents are far more common now than they were ten years ago because today's drivers are less tolerant of bad driving, campaigners say. A third of motorists witnessed physical brawls between drivers over the last year, while half had seen verbal abuse, the RAC's report on motoring found. The motoring group is blaming the epidemic on our over-reliance on cars for getting around, record congestion and 'pressures of modern life'. Spokesman Simon Williams said: 'Perhaps it is also the case that our tolerance of other people who make mistakes while driving is falling.'\n\n'Why do we accept it is OK for six people a day to die on our roads? It's certainly not acceptable. We need more traffic police to reduce the number of causalities on our roads.'\n\nLabour MP Lilian Greenwood, chairman of the transport committee, said: 'In 2017, there were 773 casualties \u2013 including 43 fatalities and 135 serious injuries \u2013 in road traffic collisions where a driver using a mobile phone was a contributory factor.\n\n'Every one of these casualties could have been avoided if drivers had been paying attention to driving and not their phone.'\n\nRAC spokesman Rod Dennis added: 'Primarily, the police need the resources to catch offenders in the first place but we also think it's time the Government and the police looked at technology that can be used to enforce the law.'", "description": "Almost a quarter of drivers (23 per cent) admit to making or receiving calls on a hand-held phone while driving.
