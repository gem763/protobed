Like Equity Income, it was suspended last week.\n\nIt has left Oxford-based Woodford with no choice but to close his business, Woodford Investment Management, that he founded in 2014 after building a reputation as a top manager in the 2000s.\n\nCritical: Peter Hargreaves\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Hargreaves says: 'Was he [Woodford] a great stock-picker? With the benefit of hindsight, I am not sure.\n\n'It appears he didn't have the knowledge in unquoted companies and rarely a week went by without him being steeped in various problems.\n\n'The crux of the matter was his organisation was probably inadequate for purpose \u2013 couldn't cope with the billions that poured in from investors.'\n\nHargreaves also claims Woodford's strategy of buying under-valued stocks no longer worked.\n\n'He hadn't recognised the world is significantly different,' he says.\n\n'Many cyclical stocks won't recover \u2013 they will gradually fade out of business. The investment scene and world economy is greatly changed.'\n\nHargreaves Lansdown, where Mr Hargreaves is a shareholder but no longer an employee, could be fined for its role in heavily promoting Woodford Equity Income despite having concerns over its portfolio.\n\nYesterday, Woodford said he appreciated that many people in the financial industry wished to express their views.\n\nHe added: 'I am sorry, and I personally deeply regret the impact events have had on The Mail on Sunday readers who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management and invested in our funds.'", "description": "The founder of one of the City's top investment firms has launched a scathing attack on Neil Woodford, the star fund manager whose business shut last week.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
