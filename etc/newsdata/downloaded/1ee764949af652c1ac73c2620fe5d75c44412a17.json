Alexandra Wilshaw did, so no one realised she was ill", "language": "en", "text": "\u2018Bubbly\u2019: Durham University student Alexandra Wilshaw\n\nThe story is tragic yet perhaps also frighteningly familiar to many families who have lost loved ones to suicide. Cheerleader Alexandra Wilshaw was described by friends and family as vibrant, bubbly, loud and funny.\n\nThe 21-year-old straight-A student, who was in her third year studying maths at Durham University, had everything to live for.\n\nYet on March 18 last year she was discovered unconscious in her bedroom, having tried to hang herself. She died in hospital later that day.\n\n\u2018When the police arrived to tell me, I just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u2019 says her mother Carole, 51. \u2018I just thought, \u201cIt isn\u2019t her. It can\u2019t be.\u201d \u2019\n\nThe year before she died, Alexandra has been prescribed medication for anxiety, yet seemed to have turned a corner.\n\nHer heartbroken mother, a technology audit manager, still finds herself going over their final conversations, wondering if there could have been any sign of her daughter\u2019s turmoil.\n\nCarole says: \u2018We never knew there was anything wrong. I asked how her anxiety was every time I spoke to her and she told me it was fine. I believed her.\u2019\n\nEarlier this month, Alexandra\u2019s family, still reeling from their loss, launched a campaign in their daughter\u2019s name to help promote awareness of anxiety, depression and the risk of suicide, and better ways to cope with these issues.\n\nPart of their message is that, as was the case with Alexandra, people with depression may not seem typically unwell.\n\nHer heartbroken mother Carole, a technology audit manager, still finds herself going over their final conversations, wondering if there could have been any sign of her daughter\u2019s turmoil\n\nThe year before she died, Alexandra has been prescribed medication for anxiety, yet seemed to have turned a corner\n\nExperts now warn that up to half of patients with the common mental illness don\u2019t suffer telltale symptoms such as insomnia, loss of appetite and lethargy. Indeed, many seem upbeat and outgoing, despite suffering periods of low mood and harbouring dark thoughts.\n\nPrivate distress can continue for years without anyone realising that there is a serious problem. Sometimes, not even the sufferers themselves know they are unwell.\n\nAccording to psychiatrists, the hidden symptoms of so-called atypical depression \u2013 sometimes dubbed \u2018smiling depression\u2019 \u2013 make it especially deadly.\n\nAs the illness is less likely to be picked up and treated early on in these cases, sufferers are more likely to die by suicide.\n\nIt is a story that James, a 34-year-old solicitor from Norwich, who agreed to speak anonymously, knows all too well.\n\nExperts now warn that up to half of patients with the common mental illness don\u2019t suffer telltale symptoms such as insomnia, loss of appetite and lethargy\n\nHe remembers being plagued by depressive thoughts and ruminating over the smallest criticisms, even as a teenager. Yet to friends and family, he seemed outgoing and happy.\n\n\u2018Anyone who knew me would say, \u201cJames is either really up or really down.\u201d And I suppose I\u2019ve never struggled with confidence. But there was always this fog somewhere in the background.\n\n\u2018When people describe depression as a dark cloud, it\u2019s really accurate. My way of coping was to find things to distract myself. I\u2019d go out with friends or start a new gym regime. When I felt good, everything was fine. But then something would knock me sideways. It could be an argument with a colleague, or a problem with a girlfriend.\n\n\u2018If a stranger was rude, no matter how slight, it would make me lose my rag, and then I\u2019d find myself picking over it in my mind, blaming myself and worrying.\u2019\n\nOn March 18 last year Alexandra was discovered unconscious in her bedroom, having tried to hang herself. She died in hospital later that day\n\nAstonishingly, James struggled on into his early 30s without any medical help, holding down a job at a legal firm. But in 2017 he reached breaking point.\n\nHe says: \u2018A relationship ended, and I started a new job, which was tough. Suddenly, nothing that used to make me happy did any more. The fog never lifted.\u2019\n\nAt his lowest ebb, James planned to take his own life. \u2018A friend had died in the same way, and in my darkest moments I thought about him and what he would have wanted. I knew I had to get help.\u2019\n\nAfter visiting his GP, James was prescribed medication and has had weekly psychotherapy sessions ever since, which he says helps to keep him stable.\n\nHe adds: \u2018Meditation and regular exercise have also been really important. These things might not work for everyone but they do for me.\u2019\n\nCambridge University psychology researcher Olivia Remes says cases such as James\u2019s are common.\n\n\u2018Patients with atypical depression do suffer from low mood, but this can lift in response to good news or positive events,\u2019 she explains.\n\nThe 21-year-old straight-A student, who was in her third year studying maths at Durham University, had everything to live for\n\nSufferers may tell no one about their problems \u2013 and even seem happy and well to outsiders \u2013 until an event triggers a crisis.\n\n\u2018Patients often suffer a breakdown in response to a perceived rejection or criticism \u2013 perhaps a relationship problem, or something going wrong at work,\u2019 says Remes. \u2018It is at this point that they are most vulnerable.\n\n\u2018Perhaps if more of these kinds of cases were picked up earlier and treatment was offered, then suicides could be prevented.\u2019\n\nConsultant psychiatrist Philip Wilkinson believes that rather than group depression into subtypes such a typical or atypical, it should be seen as a spectrum illness.\n\n\u2018Depression affects people differently, and not always in ways that we expect,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018There are the classic signs, like feeling demotivated and unable to get out of bed. But for others, it\u2019s an over-sensitivity to everyday events, or in older people, memory problems or confusion. These things can all go hand in hand with the sadness of depression.\u2019\n\nSufferers of atypical depression often report sleeping for long periods \u2013 more than ten hours a night \u2013 increased appetite and weight gain. Strangely, some also suffer what is known as leaden paralysis: the sensation of heavy limbs, lasting for more than an hour a day.\n\nSome studies suggest that the commonly prescribed antidepressant drug fluoxetine is effective only in about half of patients with atypical depression, compared to about two thirds of those with typical depression.\n\nIn atypical cases, a class of drugs called monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be particularly helpful. However, they are seldom offered by GPs due to side effects such as dizziness, nausea and blood-pressure problems.\n\nDr Wilkinson says: \u2018These would be prescribed by a psychiatrist, following a referral by the GP after several medications have been tried out but nothing has worked.\n\n\u2018Patients need to be monitored by a specialist due to risks.\u2019\n\nHe adds: \u2018Doctors need to be aware that depression can be different for every person. Not every patient fits into a neat set of criteria.\u2019", "description": "Alexandra Wilshaw, who was in her third year studying maths at Durham University, was discovered unconscious in her bedroom, having tried to hang herself.
