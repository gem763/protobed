I don't really understand.'\n\nShock: Coleen was spotted outside her Cheshire home on Friday morning in the midst of her controversial war of words with Rebekah\n\nShe then went on to suggest she didn't entirely agree with Rebekah's course of action, and believes she should have ignored Coleen's claims.\n\n'But then I don't get Rebekah Vardy's side either because if I was her and I knew I had done nothing, I wouldn't even reply, I would just send a lawyer's letter.'\n\nAhead of Stacey's Loose Women appearance, Coleen was spotted outside her Cheshire home on Friday morning.\n\nConfused: The Loose Women panellist, 30, said she 'couldn't understand' why the WAG has addressed Coleen's claims publicly rather than just sending a lawyer's letter\n\nThe wife of Wayne Rooney, 33, maintained a steely expression as she headed out in her lavish motor just two days after alleging that the pregnant spouse of Jamie Vardy, 37, was leaking fake stories about her to The Sun newspaper.\n\nAs she stepped out, fellow WAG Nicola McLean, 38, appeared on This Morning, where she lashed out at Coleen for the danger she is placing on Rebekah, who is seven months pregnant and is said to be 'distressed'.\n\nGiving her opinion on the row, Nicola hit out at Coleen for publicly accusing pregnant Rebekah of leaking stories about her to the press.\n\nWoah: WAG Nicola McLean has hit out at Coleen for publicly accusing pregnant Rebekah of leaking stories about her to the press\n\nIn what has become a War of the WAGs, Coleen released an incredible social media statement aimed at Rebekah in which she revealed she set up an elaborate sting on Instagram to 'catch' who was leaking fake stories.\n\nSubsequently Nicola issued a warning to Coleen about stressing out an expectant mother, as she said: 'Coleen doing this is not okay... Something is going to happen to a pregnant woman and a baby!'\n\nColeen's dramatic revelation enthralled Britain and sparked an angry denial from pregnant Rebekah, who said 'I don't need the money\u2019 and pointed out other people have had access to her Instagram account.\n\nNot ok... Appearing on This Morning on Friday, Nicola said: 'Coleen doing this is not okay, as a mother its not okay. She should come out here, until she's proven guilty'\n\nGot her back: Nicola, who is married to footballer Tom Williams, has been friends with Rebakah for years and share the same urgent (pictured together in October 2018)\n\nThe wife of Jamie Vardy has now given an interview with The Daily Mail, in which she insisted arguing with Coleen is akin to rowing 'with a pigeon'.\n\nSince Rebekah's explosive interview, Nicola, who shares the same agent as WAG Rebekah, has come out in protection of her pal, as she said: 'I\u2019ve not spoken to her today but you can imagine how she is absolutely devastated...\n\n'Absolutely forget who it is - a celeb, a WAG, a normal person. Pregnancy. We all know stress can cause so much upset. We've just had a report from psychiatrists that said said that it can cause stress on the brain.'\n\nOn attacking a pregnant woman, she said: 'I disagree with [what she's done]. I don\u2019t think she knows it's Rebekah and I think exactly she\u2019s seven months pregnant, it\u2019s so hypocritical for a show to promote mental health well-being...\n\nShock: Earlier in the day, Rebekah slammed trolls who wished her unborn baby would die in the wake of her Coleen story leaking scandal\n\n'This could have waited, Coleen said it\u2019s been going on for however many years then she should have waited\u2026 regardless we're talking about a pregnant woman...\n\n'You know what - regardless - it's Coleen's basement got flooded or something is going to happen to a pregnant woman and a baby'.\n\nShe pushed: 'If Dr. Ranj was here now he'd be saying exactly the same thing as me, you should protect yourself if you\u2019re pregnant regardless of if it\u2019s the fifth baby...\n\n'I\u2019m not saying you should mollycoddle someone. She could have stopped it, she didn\u2019t need to do this. I don\u2019t know Coleen, I don\u2019t know her but as a mother and someone in this industry for a long time she knows what happens...\n\nHitting back: Nicola seemed enraged by the treatment of her pal\n\n'She knew and did this to a pregnant woman. If someone caused your daughter this level of stress, we all have to have compassion of the fact regardless of how many pregnancies she's had. We've got someone who is seven months pregnant receiving death threats, saying they hope her unborn baby dies'.\n\nAside from the comments about Rebekah, Nicola then said: 'She\u2019s used to being betrayed...', in what appeared to be a dig at some of the tempestuous stages in Coleen's marriage involving husband Wayne's indiscretions.\n\nRebekah has slammed trolls who have wished her unborn baby would die in the wake of the leaking scandal.\n\nI got you: Coleen's explosive post on Wednesday saw her claim Rebekah's account was leaking false stories to the press (the WAGs pictured together in 2017)\n\nTaking to Instagram on Wednesday evening, Rebekah shared a screenshot of an Instagram message sent to her by a follower who penned: 'F**k u dirty sly c**t I hope that baby dies within you B***H'.\n\nNicola, who is the wife of former Arizona United SC star Tom Williams went on: 'I\u2019ve been reading [the trolling] personally, it's horrific: \"I hope the unborn baby dies, hope they both die\", this level of abuse is horrific especially if you\u2019re pregnant'.\n\nOn the public not liking her pal, Nicola said: 'People don\u2019t like her as much as they like Coleen, that just proves my point, it's okay it's happening because Rebekah Vardy rubs people the wrong way...\n\n'If you\u2019re an outspoken strong female people aren\u2019t going to like you. I like her.'\n\nIt has been revealed that Rebekah has hired a team of forensic IT experts to prove her innocence after Coleen accused her of selling stories to the press through information she obtained from her private Instagram.\n\nA spokesman for Coleen said: 'It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.'\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these shock claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and she concluded that it was Rebekah's account", "description": "Stacey Solomon claimed she would take legal action against Coleen Rooney if she outed her in the same way she has to Rebekah Vardy.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/20/19605060-0-image-a-120_1570823234444.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
