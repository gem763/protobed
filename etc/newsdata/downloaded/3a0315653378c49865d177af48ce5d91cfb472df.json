Up to 7 October 2018, the JSE\u2019s performance was still negative by 7% for the year and NO passive ETFs made the list of top 20 best performing funds for 2018.\n\nOn the contrary, 44% of those best-performing funds are made up of actively management funds (General Equity Unit Trusts), which, on a year-to-date basis, is still ahead of the JSE in terms of performance.\n\nOf the 76 funds which make up this 44%, 17 were completely positive for the year \u2013 and this is quite an achievement as it\u2019s no secret that for investors, this has been an incredibly challenging year so far.\n\nFurthermore, despite their higher-than-average costs, the actively managed funds which managed to outperform the JSE in 2018 so far, have managed to do so by an average of 4%.\n\nI\u2019m sure that there are quite a few passively managed fund supporters out there who may consider my data biased, but I assure you that this is not the case.\n\nI feel that there will always be space for good passively managed funds in most investment portfolios.\n\nWhat I want to reiterate, is the fact that while ETFs\u2019 main purpose is to offer lower costs and a low tracking error, active managers\u2019 main purpose is to manage both investors\u2019 growth as well as risk.\n\nMy mom always said that if you buy something cheap, it may end up costing you an arm and a leg.\n\nSo when doing your homework on investments, make sure that you don\u2019t only consider the price of those investments, but that you also take a look at their risk-adjusted historical returns.", "description": "Passive ETFs have proven to be a great strategy over the last few years, writes PSG Wealth\u2019s Schalk Louw.
