Will That Change His Legacy?", "language": "en", "text": "In his first major interview in the three years since he left Downing Street and British politics, Cameron opened with an apology. \u201cWell, I\u2019m deeply sorry about all that\u2019s happened,\u201d Cameron told British broadcaster ITV. Sorry, that is, for losing the 2016 referendum; sorry for his years of faulting the EU without highlighting the benefits of its membership; and sorry for political divisions that have plagued the country since. But while some in his cabinet, including his former chancellor and close ally George Osborne, expressed regrets over holding the referendum itself, Cameron insisted the vote over Britain\u2019s place in Europe was \u201cinevitable.\u201d (On the other decision he is most known for\u2014imposing what has amounted to a decade of public-spending cuts following the 2008 financial crisis\u2014Cameron didn\u2019t waver. His government \u201cprobably didn\u2019t cut enough\u201d when it came to austerity, he said.)\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a day that goes by when I don\u2019t think about all the decisions I made,\u201d Cameron said during the ITV interview, \u201cand all that has followed.\u201d\n\nState apologies for past errors are becoming more common in modern-day politics, yet rarely do leaders express regret for their own actions\u2014especially so soon after they have taken place. It\u2019s not necessarily an act many will even appreciate. After all, Cameron isn\u2019t alone in thinking about Brexit every day\u2014for many in Britain, there isn\u2019t an option (a condition that has since been dubbed \u201cBrexit fatigue\u201d). For others, it may not register as a genuine apology at all.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t actually use the word apologize anywhere,\u201d Edwin Battistella, the author of Sorry About That: The Language of Public Apology, told me in reference to Cameron\u2019s ITV interview, adding: \u201cI can be sorry it\u2019s raining or I can be sorry that someone is not in the office if someone calls. But it\u2019s not really an apology. It\u2019s a sort of reflection on how he feels.\u201d\n\nCameron also deflects blame. Though he accepted that he could have done more to promote the benefits of EU membership in the years leading up to the referendum, he told The Times of London that \u201cI wasn\u2019t making up stuff about Europe\u201d when he criticized the bloc. He took responsibility for what was ultimately \u201cmy referendum, my campaign, my decision to try and renegotiate,\u201d but faulted opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn for not doing more to help. He expressed an affinity for current Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his deputy Michael Gove, both fellow Conservatives who backed the campaign to leave the EU, but criticized them for acting \u201cappallingly\u201d during the referendum and, when it came to claims about issues such as immigration and EU spending, \u201cleft the truth at home.\u201d\n\nThe former prime minister also offered rare criticism of his successor, Theresa May, who like him has found the legacy of her premiership dominated by Brexit (though, unlike Cameron, she decided to stay on as a member of Parliament following her resignation from Downing Street). He suggested that May didn\u2019t appreciate how her lack of a parliamentary majority would inhibit her ability to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons, adding that \u201ca closer partnership ... would have been a better way to proceed.\u201d", "description": "The former prime minister\u2019s newly released book, For the Record, points to a leader trying to reshape the narrative of a seismic moment in Britain\u2019s history, and the role he played in it.", "authors": ["Yasmeen Serhan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2IWZZ/facebook.jpg?1568977391", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
