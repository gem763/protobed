Both are starting their fourth straight pool games, and he wants to rest them as soon as possible.\n\nIt all depends on a XV in which 11 players are making their first starts in this tournament. Five of them are even making their first appearance. All that depth-building for the last four years will be tested by Uruguay, and Gatland has urged his players to make his life and theirs easier by winning comfortably to complete a sweep of the pool.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we do a job early on against Uruguay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging with such a short turnaround but that\u2019s what World Cups are all about.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about creating as much strength in depth in the squad as we could over the last three or four years. The squad is in a good place mentally. There are a group of players that are excited about the chance to go out and, for a lot of them, get their first game at a World Cup.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s given them the carrot of a shot at the quarterfinals, too, though it\u2019s hard to see the players who tore apart Georgia 43-14 , held off Australia 29-25 , and overcame Fiji 29-17 pushed out of a quarterfinal squad.\n\n\u201cThe door is not shut,\u201d Gatland promised. \u201cThere are opportunities for players to go out there and impress and stake a claim for a quarterfinal spot. It\u2019s not just an idle comment. If someone does go out and performs outstandingly we will look at them for the following week.\u201d\n\nThere might be openings in the backline.\n\nFlyhalf Dan Biggar, who took a head knock in a mid-air collision then slammed his head on the ground against Fiji, was \u201csymptom free\u201d Gatland said, and still undergoing the head injury assessment. Center Jonathan Davies had an injured knee, and wing George North a damaged ankle.\n\nThe only backs in the reserves were scrumhalves Tomos Williams and Gareth Davies, who finished against Fiji on the wing.\n\nGatland wouldn\u2019t say who was the flyhalf backup.\n\n\u201cYou can play 10 as well can\u2019t you, Justin?\u201d Gatland asked flanker and first-time captain Justin Tipuric half-seriously.\n\nThe coach said he\u2019s prepared to play guys out of position, noting reserve flanker James Davies can play on the wing, and so can Tipuric.\n\nBut they need first to have Uruguay, which also beat Fiji , far in their rearview mirror.\n\nNaturally, the Uruguayans won\u2019t cooperate. They were proud to trail Australia only 19-3 last Saturday, and the end result was a 20-point better loss than at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\n\u201cWe are going to play Wales like our first half against Australia,\u201d reserve back Rodrigo Silva said. \u201cWe will try to play 80 minutes at that pace.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nWales: Leigh Halfpenny, Josh Adams, Owen Watkin, Hadleigh Parkes, Hallam Amos, Rhys Patchell, Aled Davies; Aaron Wainwright, Justin Tipuric (captain), Aaron Shingler, Adam Beard, Bradley Davies, Dillon Lewis, Ryan Elias, Nicky Smith.
