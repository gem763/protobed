That gave the Asian unit an enterprise value of $45 billion, helping the parent company reduce its massive debt load and laying the groundwork for possible future acquisitions.\n\nThe shares rose to as high as HK$28.90 in Hong Kong trading Monday, from the offering price of HK$27. The benchmark Hang Seng Index increased 0.6%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen very solid demand for our stock when we did the management roadshow,\u201d said Jan Craps, chief executive officer of Budweiser Brewing APAC, in a briefing in Hong Kong on Monday. \u201cWe are confident there\u2019s a strong foundation here.\u201d\n\nThe result provides an encouraging conclusion to what\u2019s been a rocky IPO path for the Asia arm of the world\u2019s biggest beer company. Budweiser Brewing originally expected to storm into Hong Kong as a $64 billion company, but the deal was shelved in July amid lackluster demand. It was a high-profile setback that spotlighted the growing disconnect between companies\u2019 lofty private valuations and investors\u2019 expectations, with would-be buyers skeptical of even well-known brands.\n\nSecond Try\n\nAB InBev revived the offering after selling its Australian operations to Japan\u2019s Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. for about $11 billion. That roughly halved the size of the Asia-Pacific offering, giving investors a more focused stake in faster-growing parts of the regional business, with brands like Cass in South Korea and Harbin in China.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly a more reasonable level than the first time around,\u201d Andrew Sullivan, director at Pearl Bridge Partners Ltd., said of Budweiser\u2019s valuation on Bloomberg Television. \u201cLooking forward, it gives them an opportunity to build more deals in Asia.\u201d\n\nThe gains in Budweiser\u2019s trading debut may give some hope to a global IPO scene unsettled this year by volatile markets and geopolitical uncertainties. Multiple companies have halted their scheduled listings in Hong Kong, which is facing twin pressures from anti-government protests that show no sign of abating and a trade war between the U.S. and China.\n\nBudweiser\u2019s launch helps propel Hong Kong past Shanghai as the world\u2019s No. 3 market for IPOs this year. It may also shore up investor sentiment for upcoming IPOs that may include the lucrative secondary listing of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\n\n\u201cThis IPO is quite different to many others that have faced headwinds recently,\u201d said analyst Euan McLeish at Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cBUD APAC is widely recognized as a high-quality company.\u201d He added that \u201cstrong earnings visibility\u201d will drive continued investor interest.\n\nThe share offering helped AB InBev further trim down its $100 billion-plus debt pile after its purchase of SABMiller in 2016, letting it accelerate its goal of creating a regional champion in Asia, especially through acquisitions.\n\nCEO Craps said Monday the company can create a lot of value with regional players in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nThe sale of the Australian unit to Asahi lopped off about one-fifth of the Asia-Pacific unit, cutting its annual sales to about $6.7 billion, according to the latest preliminary prospectus. But the deal increased Budweiser Brewing\u2019s 2018 growth rate by more than a percentage point, to 7.4%, as it removed operations in a more mature market.\n\nTrack Record\n\nThe track record for IPOs hasn\u2019t been impressive lately.\n\nFitness startup Peloton Interactive Inc. on Thursday dropped 11% on its first day of trading. That same day, the Hollywood agency Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. shelved its IPO, citing unfavorable market conditions. WeWork, the office-sharing company, was forced to put off its offering to next year in the face of tepid demand.\n\nUber, which raised $8.1 billion for its May IPO, is down 33% from its offer price.\n\n(updates trading, adds analyst quote)\n\n--With assistance from Qian Ye and Kiuyan Wong.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jinshan Hong in Hong Kong at jhong214@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rachel Chang at wchang98@bloomberg.net, Jeff Sutherland\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Asia-Pacific beer unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV gained as much as 7% in its Hong Kong trading debut, a positive for the lackluster global market in initial public offerings and vindication for the beermaker in its second attempt at an Asian listing.Budweiser Brewing Company APAC", "authors": ["Jinshan Hong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bGSaTMdM.1xyIcdMNGbP3Q--~B/aD02OTg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/df857d4f6efd16c9c1c2e0b6db85b988", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
