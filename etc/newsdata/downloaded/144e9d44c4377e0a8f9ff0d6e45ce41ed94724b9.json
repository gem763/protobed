Her skin was also discolored, doctors wrote.\n\nThe woman, who was quickly diagnosed with cyanosis \u2014 a condition that\u2019s typically characterized by low oxygen levels in red blood cells and causes the skin, lips, tongue, hands, feet and other parts of the body to turn a bluish color \u2014 also had an abnormally high respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. A normal rate for an adult at rest is 12 to 20 breaths per minute, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nDOCTORS PERFORMING KIDNEY TRANSPLANT ON GIRL, 9, DISCOVER SHOCKING ABNORMALITY IN DONATED ORGAN\n\nThe woman also had an oxygen saturation, or blood oxygen level, of 88 percent \u2014 much lower than normal levels, which typically fall between 95 and 100 percent.\n\n\u201cThe oxygen saturation value displayed on the pulse oximeter did not improve with the administration of supplemental oxygen,\u201d doctors wrote, meaning the woman\u2019s levels did not improve when she was provided additional oxygen.\n\nAdditionally, the woman had \u201cdark arterial and venous blood.\u201d Photos provided by NEJM show syringes filled with the woman\u2019s bluish-black blood.\n\nThe woman was subsequently diagnosed with methemoglobinemia, a blood disorder that can be congenital but can also be acquired, as in the patient's case. Methemoglobinemia \u2014 which, in simplest terms, is a disorder in which the body\u2019s cells do not receive enough oxygen due to an overproduction of methemoglobin \u2014 can occur following \u201cexposure to certain medicines, chemicals, or foods,\u201d Healthline states.\n\nThe condition can be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\nDoctors determined the woman developed methemoglobinemia after using \u201clarge amounts\u201d of topical benzocaine, which she said she used the night before her hospital visit. She applied the medication in an attempt to assuage a toothache, they wrote.\n\nBenzocaine, a local anesthetic, is often found in over-the-counter oral medications to treat mouth pain.\n\n\u201cMethemoglobinemia can occur after exposure to a number of medications, including topical anesthetic agents such as benzocaine, through metabolic pathways that appear to vary from person to person, which may account for the unpredictability of this complication,\u201d the case report reads.\n\nMAN\u2019S FOOT SEVERED IN HORRIFIC MOTORCYCLE CRASH REATTACHED DURING 7-HOUR SURGERY\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 warned benzocaine-containing products should not be used to treat children under the age of two due to the increased risk of methemoglobinemia.\n\n\u201cThese products carry serious risks and provide little to no benefits for treating oral pain, including sore gums in infants due to teething,\u201d the federal agency said at the time.\n\nThe woman was treated with intravenous drugs and improved, according to the report.", "description": "A Rhode Island woman\u2019s blood turned a black-blue color \u2014 a sign of a potentially deadly blood condition \u2014\u00a0 after she took a common over-the-counter medication to relieve a toothache.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
