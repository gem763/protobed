You win the game, there\u2019s that rush. We\u2019re in a good spot.\u201d\n\nGood, and getting better all the time.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have won 10 of their last 11 games and 13 of 17, leaving them 2\u00bd games behind the Cubs for the final NL wild card. Chicago lost to Milwaukee 7-1 Friday. Arizona improved to 74-67, matching its season high at seven games over .500.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all positive for the Diamondbacks, however.\n\nLeft-hander Robbie Ray left in the fifth inning because he felt a blister starting to form on his left middle finger. Ray has been Arizona\u2019s most dependable starter lately, losing only once in the last two months. He didn\u2019t want to leave the game, but relented when Lovullo reminded him of the bigger picture.\n\n\u201cIt was the smart thing to do with what we\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d Ray said.\n\nKevin Ginkel (2-0) pitched two innings. Bradley allowed a pair of singles and a walk in the ninth before retiring Curt Casali on a fly ball for his 13th save in 16 chances.\n\n\u201cThere were lots of things that didn\u2019t go in our favor, but if you\u2019re a baseball fan, that was fun to watch,\u201d Reds manager David Bell said.\n\nMarte and Rojas have been integral parts of Arizona\u2019s playoff push. They were at the center of it again Friday.\n\nNick Ahmed led off the third inning with his career-high 18th homer off Tyler Mahle (2-11). The Diamondbacks then took control with five runs in the fifth inning.\n\nRay reached on a single when he bunted over Mahle\u2019s head while trying to sacrifice. Marte followed with his career-high 31st homer for a 4-2 lead. Marte also had a grand slam Wednesday during a 4-1 victory that finished a sweep of the Padres.\n\n\u201cGreat players do great things at great times,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me anymore. He\u2019s a very, very good hitter who\u2019s doing special things every night. He\u2019s having a huge year.\u201d\n\nMahle wanted to throw a certain pitch to Marte, but went with the cut fastball that Casali called instead. Mahle left it over the plate.\n\n\u201cNext time, go with my gut feeling,\u201d Mahle said.\n\nRojas\u2019 two-run single completed the rally and left him with hits in seven of his last eight games.\n\n200K\n\nRay went over 200 strikeouts for the third time in his career. Only Randy Johnson has done better with the Diamondbacks, putting together five 200-strikeout seasons.\n\nLONG AND WINDING ROAD\n\nThe Diamondbacks play three in Cincinnati followed by four against the Mets in New York for their second-to-last trip. The Diamondbacks finish with 12 of their last 15 games at home and three in San Diego.\n\nLOVE THE ROAD\n\nArizona has a club-record 119 homers on the road, three more than the previous club mark from 1999.\n\nLOVE THIS PLACE\n\nArizona has 31 homers in its last 15 games at Great American Ball Park.\n\nNICE PLAY\n\nArizona right fielder Jarrod Dyson made a diving catch on Aristides Aquino\u2019s sinking liner with two runners aboard in the seventh.\n\nARIZONA MOVE\n\nInfielder Domingo Leyba was called up from Triple-A Reno. The Diamondbacks waited to see how he recovered from an ankle injury before adding him.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: Steven Souza Jr. is on the trip to see Reds team physician Tim Kremchek, who repaired ligaments in the outfielder\u2019s left knee in April. \u2026 Luke Weaver threw a simulated game Friday. The Diamondbacks aren\u2019t sure of his next step in recovering from right forearm tightness.\n\nReds: CF Nick Senzel was out of the lineup for a third straight game with a sore right shoulder.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDiamondbacks: Left-hander Alex Young (6-3) is 1-0 with a 3.45 ERA in his last three starts. He\u2019s facing the Reds for the first time.\n\nReds: Luis Castillo (14-5) has won his last three starts. He\u2019s 1-3 in four career starts against the Diamondbacks with a 5.01 ERA.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Arizona Diamondbacks watched closer Archie Bradley escape a bases-loaded threat, and then saw they had gained more ground in their unexpected playoff chase.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Kay"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/diamondbacks_reds_baseball_36451_c0-194-4655-2908_s1770x1032.jpg?0d58df036a56dbc0b9fe59db51b8e30820c1426a", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
