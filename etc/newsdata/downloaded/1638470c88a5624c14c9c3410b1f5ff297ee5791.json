He has been around for nearly thirty years, sometimes part of my work virtually every day; sometimes hovering in the background. So it is a bit unnerving to prepare to let him go,\u201d writes Harvey Klehr, Andrew W. Mellon Professor Emeritus of Politics and History at Emory University, and author of the highly-regarded \u201cSpies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America.\u201d\n\nAs Jonathan Brent, a fellow scholar and author of \u201cInside the Stalin Archives\u201d puts it, \u201c\u2018Harvey Klehr is unquestionably the most important living historian of American Communism and Soviet espionage in the United States.\u2019\u201d It was that world of which David Karr was a denizen, a world which collapsed suddenly with the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIt was the nature of that now dead world \u2014 the central role of the Communist Party USA, a totally-owned subsidiary of the Soviet Union, with orders coming directly from Moscow \u2014 that made Karr\u2019s career possible. It\u2019s hard to imagine today, but there were decades during the last century when a number of thoughtful people actually believed that communism, despite Soviet brutalities, was the winning ideology, the inevitable wave of the future..\n\nAs Whittaker Chambers told us, when he decided to make his activities as a Russian spy public, he believed he was leaving the winning for the losing side. But because of Chambers, and his unwavering support by Richard Nixon, Alger Hiss, a high-ranking State Department official directly involved in our dealings with Russia was exposed as a Russian agent, intensifying an already heated war between east-coast liberals, who were thought to be soft on communism, and the rest of the more sensible parts of country (which included California, in those days).\n\nIt was a time of great opportunity for apparent ideological chameleons like David Karr, who had graduated from writing for the Daily Worker and other Communist publications, while denying he was ever a party member, to working in Washington as a leg man for Drew Pearson. (Mr. Pearson, the much-loathed but widely-read political gossip columnist who attacked the supporters of Nixon and Chambers, had the distinction of once being kneed in the groin in a Washington restaurant by Sen. Joseph McCarthy.)\n\nEarly on, during the war years, Karr had landed a job working for the Office of War Information, but was quickly let go when he his resume came to the attention of investigators. Yet somehow he seemed always able to rewrite the script, to convince people he wasn\u2019t what he seemed to be. In other words, a perfect spy.\n\nAs Mr. Klehr writes, Karr, born David Katz in Brooklyn in 1918, \u201cwas the Zelig of twentieth\u2013century American life.\u201d Like Woody Allen\u2019s Zelig, \u201che popped up at key moments and important places,\u201d often next to significant political figures He caught the attention of J. Edgar Hoover, schemed with Aristotle Onassis, and was a personal friend of Henry Wallace, FDR\u2019s former vice president, and candidate for president on the Communist Party-controlled Progressive Party ticket in 1948.\n\nBut although he was singled out for investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee, condemned by Sen. McCarthy on the Senate floor, and left a trail of evidence strongly suggesting he was a valued Kremlin asset, he would become a trusted adviser to politicians like Sargent Shriver and Jerry Brown.\n\nFrom Washington to New York, Karr, who had never attended college, became a successful business executive, engineering several corporate takeovers, and incredibly enough, becoming CEO of Fairbanks Whitney, an important defense contractor, until being run off the premises by outraged shareholders.\n\nNever short of funds \u2014 he died a millionaire \u2014 and close to Moscow-connected business tycoons like Armand Hammer, he moved to Paris, facilitated the construction of a Western hotel in Moscow, and obtained North American rights to the marketing of Misha the Bear, the official mascot of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. He was also named official salesman for the Olympic commemorative coins.\n\nBefore he could enjoy the games, however, he died unexpectedly at 60. \u201cWhen he died, his last wife (there were three earlier wives, all of whom he cheated on, and the current wife was on her way out) halted the burial with a court order for an autopsy, convinced that he had been murdered. She named as suspects the KGB, CIA, Israeli Mossad, and the Mafia.\n\n\u201cNo hard evidence ever turned up, but every one of them did have a plausible reason for desiring his silence,\u201d concludes Mr. Klehr.\n\n\u2022 John R. Coyne Jr., a former White House speechwriter, is co-author of \u201cStrictly Right: William F. Buckley Jr. and the American Conservative Movement\u201d (Wiley).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE MILLIONAIRE WAS A SOVIET MOLE: THE TWISTED LIFE OF DAVID KARR\n\nBy Harvey Klehr\n\nEncounter Books, $25.99, 272 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
