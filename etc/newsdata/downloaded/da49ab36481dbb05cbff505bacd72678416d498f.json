Hailed as a masterpiece at the Venice Film Festival, it took home the Golden Lion \u2013 the top honour this festival can bestow.\n\nBut, since then, it\u2019s been criticised for allegedly justifying mass shootings and glorifying violence by white men.\n\nThe Joker, for the first time, tells the origin story of Batman\u2019s famous nemesis. And this time, it is Joaquin Phoenix wearing the white paint and scarlet grin.\n\nThe Joker starts out as a man trodden down by society at every turn. Named Arthur Fleck, he is mentally ill with delusions of being a comedian. By day, he works as a clown, twirling an advertisement sign on the streets of Gotham and visiting children\u2019s hospital wards.\n\nHe then returns to his grubby domicile where he takes care of his ailing mother. At one point, government cuts funding to social services, which is how he received counselling and medication.\n\nBut the last straw is when he is accosted by three men on a subway. At first, he just defends himself, but then a dark violence takes over and he ends up killing the men and inciting a violent mob. Raging in the streets of Gotham \u2013 as is the case in most cities \u2013 is a rampant battle against inequality.\n\nIt turns out The Joker\u2019s attackers are three Wall Street guys, and news of the incident becomes a tipping point for the public. Fleck becomes a symbol of how those at the top will be held accountable for how they could live with so much and leave so little for the rest.\n\nThe fact that the film seems to justify the violence Fleck later engages in is what has had critics buzzing. Parallels have been drawn to the lonely Fleck and members of the incel community, an online subculture of involuntary celibate men who define themselves as unable to find a romantic or sexual partner.\n\nI couldn\u2019t disagree more. The mass shooters in real life usually talk about how they feel rejected by society, particularly when it comes to matters of love. Yes, The Joker fantasised about a woman in his building \u2013 played by Zazie Beetz \u2013 but his aggression is not rooted solely in his sexual desires or in her not really knowing him.\n\nCritics say the film could incite violence, but how exactly would a villain such as The Joker or the masses of displeased Gothamites get the attention they deserve without violence?\n\nAlso, he doesn\u2019t shoot up a school, he exacts his anger on three men who attacked him, as well as talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).\n\nThe leading men are sublime in this story of a villain who takes centre stage with a much needed gust of fresh thought. But how exactly are you going to watch a story of a villain such as The Joker and not see some disturbing things? The Joker isn\u2019t a being with superpowers like Thanos.\n\nHe\u2019s a man who plummets to the depths of violence because of a society that shunned him.\n\nFor me, The Joker is one of the top features released this year, alongside Once Upon a Time in ...
