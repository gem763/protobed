There is \u201cModern Witchcraft,\u201d by the Wiccan high priestess Deborah Blake, which argues for witchcraft as a female-focused religion, and \u201cRevolutionary Witchcraft,\u201d by Sarah Lyons, a guide to the history and practice of politically motivated magic.\n\nThere is fictional witchery in \u201cHex Life,\u201d a collection of witch stories written by female fantasy authors, and also plenty of self-help. \u201cBitchcraft: Simple Spells for Everyday Annoyances and Sweet Revenge\u201d is pretty much what it sounds like; \u201cWild Witch: A Guide to Earth Magic\u201d focuses on magic through plants and herbs.
