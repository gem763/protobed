On a month-long stay, they are providing an obscene culture clash for our TV enjoyment.\n\nDespite enormous \u00adcriticism, with viewers blasting it as racist and dehumanising, it was fascinating.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nParts made for uncomfortable viewing \u2013 the villagers having to dig for water while the Moffatts turned on a tap \u2013 but rarely do you see other cultures react to our way of living.\n\nIt was a real eye-opener.\n\n\u201cI find it very strange for one person to have so many clothes,\u201d said Kandisiko, confronted with a cupboard bursting with strappy shoes.\n\nThis scene spoke volumes. We all have too much pointless stuff.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nThe idea of stairs was bewildering. \u201cAre we climbing? Will we fall?\u201d\n\nThe concept of a doorbell was met with delight, while the hall mirror presented as a magic trick.\n\nScarlett later found herself explaining veneers.\n\n\u201cWhy are your teeth so white? Why is your hair darker than your \u00adeyebrows? You\u2019re like a shapeshifter.\u201d\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nI loved seeing Scarlett bond with the women, all on her bed like teenagers \u00adchatting about her body image issues.\n\nThe women came across as fiercely strong, confident and happy, while Scarlett was a sobbing mess. What does this say about our culture?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve everything at our fingertips but our society is full of stress,\u201d said Scarlett.\n\nWhile the format is hugely questionable, kudos to the Moffatts, who are genuine and respectful.\n\nA bad idea with big-hearted stars.", "description": "WARNING: CONTAINS NUDITY - The British Tribe Next Door arrived on Channel 4 this week and left viewers dumbstruck", "authors": ["Sara Wallis", "Image", "Pa", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704094.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_offatt-in-tears-after-being-pushed-to-get-her-boobs-out_1778JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
