Before April 2018, I took the pill because Jim doesn't like wearing condoms,' Jessica said.\n\nA Chinese backpacker has warned of a European called 'Jim' who told her he had 'inactive sperm' before dumping her after she fell pregnant\n\nJessica said she was initially 'okay' with Jim not wearing condoms, until he misled her about his sperm.\n\n'On May, I said the pill was making me fat and uncomfortable, I wanted to stop,' she said.\n\n'But he refused wearing condoms and told me his sperm is not active and he couldn't make babies.'\n\nJessica said she was in love with Jim and chose to trust him.\n\n'He promised me marriage and that we could look after the baby together if that happens,' she said.\n\n'I believed him since he called me wife most of time. I was inexperienced.\n\n'I thought he would stay with me all the time. But I was just so naive.'\n\nJessica said the couple didn't know how to handle her pregnancy as she was weak and suffered from constant belly pains.\n\nJessica said she hopes her story can serve as a lesson for other inexperienced women. 'I wrote this because I wanted to tell women, especially inexperienced ones like me, don't lose your mind when you fall in love with someone,' she said\n\nJessica's parents urged her to return to China and Jim encouraged the move.\n\n'Jim said he would come later to China to visit me,' she said.\n\nBut when Jessica returned home, Jim said he was 'busy all the time'.\n\n'I had a lot of health issues and complications associated with my pregnancy,' Jessica said.\n\n'I had a very hard time. Unfortunately I lost the baby. After that, Jim broke up with me.\n\n'Then he told me he never wanted to come to China and it dawned on me that he just wanted to send me away.'\n\nJessica said she met 34-year-old 'Jim' while on a working holiday visa in Mount Isa, Queensland (pictured), in May 2017\n\nJessica said she hopes her story can serve as a lesson for other inexperienced women.\n\n'I wrote this because I wanted to tell women, especially inexperienced ones like me, don't lose your mind when you fall in love with someone,' she said.\n\nJessica said Jim's full name is 'very different' and claimed he is illegally living in Australia after overstaying his visa.\n\n'I covered for him in the past but now I want to tell all the people of Mount Isa to be wary of him,' she said.\n\nJessica said her pregnancy has brought 'a lot of trauma' which she expects to carry throughout her lifetime.\n\nShe said she was wary to tell her story because she's 'ashamed' of what she did as a 'traditional Chinese girl'.\n\n'But after I watching the American TV series Unbreakable I decided to tell the public.'\n\n'I don't want more victims.'", "description": "The woman, whose English name is Jessica, said she met 34-year-old 'Jim' while on a working holiday visa in Mount Isa, Queensland,\u00a0in May 2017.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/02/19866592-0-image-a-12_1571363972470.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
