The news was announced on Monday morning, and was followed by a slight dip in Netflix\u2019s stock price.\n\nThe decision to increase its investment in content production follows Netflix\u2019s well-received earnings beat last week, when it reported revenues of $5.24 billion versus the $5.25 billion expected, and EPS of $1.47 versus the $1.07 expected. Despite missing on subscriber numbers in Q3, Netflix\u2019s stock quickly surged on the news.\n\nHowever, the streaming service is not out of the woods just yet. It will soon face significant competition \u2014 especially among families with children \u2014 when Disney+ launches next month. Apple is also poised to launch Apple TV+, NBCU is bringing us Peacock, AT&T\u2019s TimeWarner is debuting HBO Max, and Jeffrey Katzenberg is launching a mobile-only service called Quibi with big-name talent attached.\n\nOn their own, each of the new services wouldn\u2019t be likely to unseat Netflix as a top streamer. But combined, they can chip away at Netflix\u2019s user base if consumers decide to ditch and switch, instead of adding on yet another subscription.\n\nOn Netflix\u2019s Q3 earnings call, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings even admitted that Disney is going to be \u201ca great competitor.\u201d However, he pointed out that all of the services \u2014 including Hulu, YouTube and Amazon Prime \u2013have been competing more with linear TV than with each other.\n\nThat said, Netflix still needs to up its content game to keep customers subscribed. And that can be expensive.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t shy away from taking bold swings if we think the business impact will also be amazing. We don\u2019t close every deal we chase and we don\u2019t chase every deal on the table,\u201d said Hastings, in Netflix\u2019s Q3 letter to shareholders. He added that while not all Netflix\u2019s projects work out, the large and growing subscriber base lets its experiment. And the size of its content budget \u2014 $10 billion on P&L spend and $15 billion in cash content spend \u2014 helps Netflix from getting too dependent on any single hit show.\n\nThe company also said its growing revenue base and expanding margins would allow it to fund more content spending internally, with cash flow freeing up further in 2020 and beyond.\n\nIn the meantime, however, Netflix is taking on debt.\n\nIn today\u2019s announcement, Netflix says it intends to use the net proceeds from this offering \u201cfor general corporate purposes, which may include content acquisitions, production and development, capital expenditures, investments, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.\u201d", "description": "For the second time this year, Netflix is offering $2 billion in debt to fund its investment in content, including original programming, content acquisitions, investments, and more.
