At the same time, the exciting pool of talent coming through from our youth and academy sections is a result of increased investment in this area over the last five years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that while our successful commercial operation helps drive that investment, the priority is the focus on achieving success on the pitch. Similarly, it is worth noting that we are not looking at or buying players based on their commercial appeal.\n\n\u201cWe agree that recruitment is critical,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe are committed to getting this right and there has been huge investment in this area to put our recruitment department into a position to be able to deliver the manager the players he wants. This process is significantly more effective than four to five years ago.\u201d\n\nUnited are yet to appoint the club\u2019s first-ever technical director, despite a search which has lasted for almost a year.\n\nThe club told those present at the fans\u2019 forum that though they are open to changing the club\u2019s recruitment structure, they are satisfied with the process which brought Maguire, Wan-Bissaka and James to the club this summer.\n\n\u201cWe are continually reviewing and looking at the potential to evolve our structure on the football side,\u201d a United spokesperson told fans.\n\n\u201cMuch of the speculation around this type of role focuses purely on recruitment. We\u2019ve materially expanded our recruitment department in recent years and we believe this runs in an efficient and productive way.\n\n\u201cMany of the senior staff in these roles have been at the club for over 10 years. Recruitment recommendations and decisions are worked on by this department and the manager and his team, not senior management.\n\n\u201cWe feel the players signed this summer demonstrate that this approach is the right one and any future appointment would complement this process. Regarding transfer budget, we have invested significantly in the squad and we will continue to do so.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United have assured supporters that the club\u2019s priority is winning trophies rather than commercial success\u00a0following a difficult start to the new season.
