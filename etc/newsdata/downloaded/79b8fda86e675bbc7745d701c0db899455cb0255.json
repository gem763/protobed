This would be the first time such a move has even been possible, considering the impeachments of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were both during their second terms.\n\n\u201cRemoval without disqualification tailors the remedy to the precise problem: letting Trump run, as he did in 2016, without wielding the powers of incumbency, the right to which he has forfeited by his incapacity to simultaneously serve as president and run a fair reelection campaign,\u201d Foley wrote.\n\nHe added that If Democrats want to avoid looking overly partisan during the process, they should stick to the single charge of the improper phone call and not point to Trump\u2019s wider range of offenses\n\n\u201cBoth Democrats and Republicans should be principled and patriotic when considering the grave matter of impeachment,\u201d Foley said. \u201cIn this hyperpolarized environment, it might be idealistic to expect Senate Republicans to elevate the integrity of elections over party loyalty. But decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus.\u201d", "description": "Let the voters decide!
