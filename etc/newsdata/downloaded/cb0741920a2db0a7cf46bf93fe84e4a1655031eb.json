Sam Wozniak, 492nd Fighter Squadron weapons system operator flight lead.\n\nThe competition is executed as a Defensive Counter Air mission. Competition planners, known as \"White Forces,\" set the parameters for each fighter squadron's \"blue air\" team.\n\n\"The White Forces provided the special instructions, rules of the competition, and a point system matrix,\" Wozniak said. \"For example, successful target defense equated 20 points and achieving missile kills equated 5 points and the team with the most points at the end wins.\"\n\nThe scenario pitted four blue air F-15s against 14 \"red air\" F-15s to defend specified targets.\n\nIn preparation, blue players had to determine the desired combat air patrol locations, distance triggers to advancing enemy forces, and inter-flight contacts for each formation to optimize mission success.", "description": "Four \"blue air\" F-15s were pitted against 14 \"red air\" F-15s \u2014 all from the 48th Fighter Wing \u2014 to defend specified targets.", "authors": ["Airman Class Rhonda Smith", "Us Air Force"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e5d0b2e22af212503c5f7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
