I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DID!\u2019\n\nAccording to the post, the couple \u2014 who was not identified \u2014 sent out invitations requesting guests RSVP by Sept. 10, 2019. However, under the traditional \u201cdeclines with regret\u201d and \u201caccepts with pleasure\u201d options is a warning: \u201cIf you do not RSVP by September 10th please bring a chair and a sandwich.\u201d\n\nAn anonymous Reddit user posted a picture of the unique invitations on the \u201cfunny\u201d subreddit along with the simple headline: \u201cA wedding invitation, A chair and a sandwich.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe cutthroat approach has been met with praise on the forum, with many sharing their own RSVP nightmares while planning a wedding.\n\n\u201cGood for them.
