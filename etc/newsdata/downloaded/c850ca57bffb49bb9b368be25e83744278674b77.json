I don\u2019t doubt myself, I\u2019m confident.\n\n\u2018Right now, I\u2019m only lacking the goals and being more decisive. Football is all about confidence.\u2019", "description": "Marca claim the club brought Hazard to help them win trophies and have\u00a0dubbed Tuesday night's fixture in Turkey the Belgian's final with Madrid staring down the barrel.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/19988052-0-image-a-25_1571657219002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
