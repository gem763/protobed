Kevin McAleenan remarks. Following multiple attempts to start, he thanks hosts and departs.\n\n\n\nFull video: https://t.co/xPU4Fdpliv pic.twitter.com/Up6tygy3JO \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 7, 2019\n\nAfter the third interruption, McAleenan thanked the event\u2019s organizer and left the stage. The Department of Homeland Security lambasted the activists in a statement Monday, saying attendees \u201cwould have learned more about DHS\u2019s successful strategy to work with international partners to reduce unlawful migration and end the exploitation of children by smugglers and cartels\u201d if the acting secretary had been allowed to speak.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment guarantees all Americans the right to free speech and assembly. Unfortunately that right was robbed from many who were scheduled to speak and attend today\u2019s event at Georgetown,\u201d DHS said in the statement. \u201cUnfortunately the Acting Secretary and the audience did not get the opportunity to engage in a robust dialogue this morning due to the disruptions of a few activists.\u201d\n\nCredo Action, the group that organized the protest, rejected any criticism of its actions however, saying institutions that feature Trump administration officials could \u201cexpect to hear from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo Trump henchmen should be given a platform to spread hatred or defend the racist, xenophobic policies put into place by Donald Trump and Stephen Miller,\u201d Nicole Regalado, Credo\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement. \u201cInstitutions that elevate the architects and enforcers of Trump\u2019s hate and normalize that cruelty can expect to hear from us.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his immigration officials have faced years of criticism over their handling of migrants at the southern border, including the government\u2019s family separation policy and its recent decision to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico. The White House also said last month it planned to slash the U.S. refugee resettlement program by nearly half.\n\nMcAleenan has become one of the most public faces of that effort after replacing former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who was forced out in April by a president unhappy with the government\u2019s efforts to stop the flow of migrants across the border.\n\nMcAleenan has reportedly grown more isolated in the department despite his work to uphold Trump\u2019s policy agenda. In an interview with The Washington Post, he broke with the president to say the family separation policy was \u201cwell intended\u201d but that it \u201cwent too far.\u201d\n\nCredo Action organized an open letter before his appearance Monday requesting his invitation be withdrawn, and a separate petition signed by hundreds of Georgetown students and faculty also made such a request.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have rule of law unless the legal academy distinguishes between raw power and legally constrained governance,\u201d Heidi Li Feldman, a law professor at Georgetown, said in a statement. \u201cAs a teacher and scholar of American law, I reject the use of Georgetown University Law School as a vehicle for legitimizing fundamental and pervasive lawless government policies and activities.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration and its officials are not simply voicing a viewpoint on justice. They are abandoning the ideal of justice as the heart of U.S. constitutional democracy. They twist law into pure force. Law as a cloak for raw power cannot be a means to justice. 10/ \u2014 Heidi Li Feldman (@HeidiLiFeldman) October 7, 2019", "description": "Activists said the acting secretary's appearance at a law school conference would have given the Trump administration a \"platform to spread hatred.\"", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9be91c210000b103abca84.png?cache=gokpvxqgyy&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
