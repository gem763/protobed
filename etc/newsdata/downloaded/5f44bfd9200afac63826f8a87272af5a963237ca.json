These factors include robust health systems, adherence to global norms, and political and security risks. It also measures public confidence in government.\n\nThe average overall index score was 40.2, with the top-scoring country, the US, scoring 83.5 out of a possible 100.\n\nSouth Africa scored 54.8 and was among a number of middle- and low-income countries that scored above some wealthy countries.\n\nSouth Africa scored well in five of the six categories; however, was found to have poor compliance with global norms. South Africa scored poorly on its financing rating.\n\nKenya was the second-highest ranked African country, ranked in 55th place.\n\nThe index found that \"collectively, international preparedness for epidemics and pandemics remains very weak\".\n\nThe index is a project of the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security in the US.\n\nMore than 100 researchers spent a year collecting and validating data, according to TimesLive.\n\nThe report calls on the UN secretary-general to set up a permanent unit for high-consequence biological threats and call a heads-of-state-level summit by 2021 on biological threats.\n\n- Compiled by Nicole McCain", "description": "South Africa has ranked 34 out of 195 countries in the Global Health Security Index.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9243/a9fe8dcfb4d14d50825be5de496fa25c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
