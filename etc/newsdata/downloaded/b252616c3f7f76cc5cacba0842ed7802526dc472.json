Willow Wilson And Nick Robles Will Take The Reins Of The Dreaming Next Year", "language": "en", "text": "The Dreaming is here. (Illustration: Nick Robles/DC Comics)\n\nDC\u2019s rebooted corner of the Sandman universe is about to get a new master.\n\nAs announced yesterday during New York Comic Con, G. Willow Wilson, the comics writer who first brought Kamala Khan to the page, will be taking up as the writer of The Dreaming, DC\u2019s ongoing set in the Dreaming, the seat of power for Dream of the Endless. Joining her will be artist Nick Robles (Doctor Mirage).\n\nThe pair will be taking over for the current creative team next year, with their first issue being The Dreaming #19, which is due out for next March. According to Comics Beat, Wilson didn\u2019t have a lot to share at the panel announcement, except for a good deal of enthusiasm and the promise that our boy William Shakespeare, who played a major role in Neil Gaiman\u2019s originating work in Sandman, will be making a return.\n\nThe Dreaming Words by me, Art by @ArtofNickRobles March 2020 pic.twitter.com/dinoIhIfNu \u2014 G. Willow Wilson (@GWillowWilson) October 6, 2019\n\nWilson is a noted fan of Gaiman\u2019s work on Sandman, so it\u2019ll be exciting to see what she comes up with. As I said, her run will begin March 2020.", "description": "DC\u2019s rebooted corner of the Sandman universe is about to get a new master....", "authors": ["Kotaku Australia", "Luke Plunkett"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nwy7igyth8a8rckymquq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
