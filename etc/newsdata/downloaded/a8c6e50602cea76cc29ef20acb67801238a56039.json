Educators denied they'd been questioned.\n\nAt the time of the children's removal from the care of their mother and father, Judge Gregg Rosenbladt credited Gray's testimony as 'very credible' unbiased and persuasive.\n\nGray's deception was only apparent when Nichole Benes, an assistant Cerro Gordo County attorney, noticed discrepancies in her testimony.\n\nAfter investigation by DHS and the attorney general's office, the extent of Gray's dishonesty emerged.\n\nOn June 12, 2018, District Associate Judge Adam Sauer ruled that Gray's testimony was riddled with 'lies and misrepresentations' and said 'that false testimony is of grave concern'.\n\n'What does not, or at least should not happen, is that an agent of the government, charged with the task of safeguarding the welfare of children, would completely fabricate contact with a family in order to mask non-compliance with the agency's policy,' Sauer wrote.\n\n'Providing false testimony of any kind is an unfathomable violation of the trust that the people in the State of Iowa place in their public servants and cast a dark and permanent shadow upon all of us.'\n\nThe judge dismissed all four petitions to terminate parental rights filed by the state, and ordered that 'referrals for new foster case placements shall stop immediately'.\n\nHe blasted the state for trying to minimize the damage that Gray had done.\n\nIt's unclear what her motives were in regards to the alleged fabricated testimony.\n\nHowever, the Associated Press reported that the 2017 case came as Iowa DHS social workers were 'under fire for failing to stop child abuse in some high-profile cases, including two teenage girls who died under the care of their adoptive parents'.\n\nLast September Gray was taken off DHS payroll, department spokesman Matt Highland confirmed.\n\nHe said Gray wasn't fired or forced to resign, and therefore the agency cannot disclose any information about her departure under Iowa law.\n\nThe agency also declined to release the findings of a review of Gray's cases that the state launched after learning about her false testimony.\n\nIt's not known whether she may have lied in other cases she managed.\n\nGray is a mother herself.\n\nLast October, she told the Associated Press that she was unaware of Sauer's ruling on the case because she was on maternity leave with newborn twins last summer.\n\nShe also declined to comment on the reason for her departure from DHS, where she'd worked for about two-and-a-half years.\n\nIn April, Gray was charged with three counts of perjury for her actions in the case of the northern Iowa family. She faced up to five years in prison.\n\nGray entered a guilty Alford plea last week in recognition that prosecutors have enough evidence against her to result in a conviction.\n\nHowever in the plea bargain she maintains her innocence.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, two charges will be dismissed and her judgement on one charge will be deferred.\n\nHer next hearing is scheduled for December 3.", "description": "Chelsie Gray, 30, allegedly lied 10 times in the court case of a northern Iowa family in 2017 where she claimed parents tested positive for drugs and children exhibited troubling behavior at school.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20086652-0-image-a-33_1571840702130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
