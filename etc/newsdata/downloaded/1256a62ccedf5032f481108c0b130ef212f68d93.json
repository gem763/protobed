During a news conference he tamped down speculation about possible plans to resign by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m here, I\u2019m serving,\u201d he said when asked about the Politico report from Thursday night while at a news conference in Lithuania. \u201cThey\u2019ve been writing the story for at least nine months now. One of these days they will probably get it right, but it\u2019s not today, it\u2019s not tomorrow, it\u2019s not next month,\u201d he reportedly added.\n\nThis is just the latest update to the story that Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to include Secretary Perry in the hearings on President Trump\u2019s telephone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings issued a subpoena last week and Perry was included.\n\nAs happens, the drama escalated when speculation began that Rick Perry plans to resign next month, or by the end of the year. Politico claimed to have three sources saying that Perry will resign. It continued as \u201csources\u201d told Axios that President Trump called Zelensky at Perry\u2019s request.\n\nPerry\u2019s spokeswoman denied his plans to resign to Politico.\n\n\u201cWhile the Beltway media has breathlessly reported on rumors of Secretary Perry\u2019s departure for months, he is still the Secretary of Energy and a proud member of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet. One day the media will be right. Today is not that day,\u201d DOE spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes said.\n\nMeanwhile, Perry is traveling in Europe and continues in his capacity as the energy secretary. Lithuania, Latvia, and Iceland are on his itinerary as he participates in a series of events with leaders and officials from Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Baltic States. In Lithuania Sunday, he participated in the Partnership for Transatlantic Energy Cooperation (P-TEC), a regional initiative consisting of 23 Central and Eastern European nations recently formed by the Secretary in March.\n\nAs a memo from the Department of Energy states, Perry followed up with a joint press conference with Minister of Energy Vaiciunas and European Commission Director-General for Energy Jorgensen. This is when he was asked about his resignation.\n\nSecretary Perry will also convene a U.S.-Poland-Ukraine trilateral following up on the recent Memorandum of Cooperation signed in Warsaw last month to develop enhanced interconnections between Poland and Ukraine, as well as hold a dialogue with representatives of Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine to advance cooperation on ensuring the energy security of Moldova. Finally, the Secretary will host a joint press conference with Minister of Energy\u017dygimantas Vai\u010di\u016bnas and European Commission Director-General for Energy Ditte Juul J\u00f8rgensen.\n\nThe rest of the week is detailed, too, in the memo:\n\nLatvia: On Tuesday, October 8, Secretary Perry will arrive in Riga, Latvia where he will deliver the keynote address at the EuroGas Central and Eastern Europe Conference to discuss energy security through energy diversity. Iceland: On Thursday, October 10, the Secretary will arrive in Reykjavik, Iceland to host a U.S. Industry Roundtable to engage with local industry stakeholders and deliver the keynote address at the Arctic Circle Assembly where he will discuss the economic and energy potential of the Arctic region.\n\nSo, while Secretary Perry is overseas, making inroads into energy deals with the Arctic region, the press is busy asking if he\u2019s going to be around for a while.\n\n\u201cThe United States finds itself in a relatively new and unique position of being able to be a major importer, particularly of liquefied natural gas into Europe,\u201d he told journalists in Vilnius after meeting with the Baltic counterparts. \u201cWe hope that all the citizens of Europe recognize that we certainly look at this as a great opportunity to bring more freedom to the marketplace, more competition to the marketplace,\u201d he added. Perry also cited figures from the International Atomic Energy Agency, showing that the supply of US gas helped Europe save 8 billion US dollars last year. Lithuania has also imported LNG from the United States via its terminal in Klaip\u0117da.\n\nIt\u2019s important for the U.S. to be a partner with European countries and the Baltic states in order to ease dependence on Russia for their energy needs. That should be the focus of stories coming out of Perry\u2019s travels this week.", "description": "Today's not the day.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Perry-7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
