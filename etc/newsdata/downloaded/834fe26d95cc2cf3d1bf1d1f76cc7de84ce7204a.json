The subject of the memo highlighted the twin challenges that one of the leading candidates has faced: \"Biden Campaign Will Hammer Donald Trump While Focusing On The Issues.\"\n\n\"This campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people's lives while simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden,\" Bedingfield wrote.\n\nShe outlined three strategies that the campaign was attempting to employ: calling out inaccuracies in Trump's charges, fighting back against Trump, and talking about issues they believe voters care most about.\n\nBiden and his campaign have struggled over the past two weeks amid a flurry of developments that have launched a House impeachment inquiry in which Biden is a central player. Biden has alternated between pushing back on Trump and seeming unsure of how to handle a situation that has placed the focus on his son Hunter.\n\nFor several days at a time, he had few public events, the only responses coming from his remarks at fundraisers at which a handful of reporters are allowed inside. But even then, he has openly ruminated about Trump in various directions.\n\nBiden on Thursday night in San Francisco talked about the allegations, then quickly shifted to say: \"This isn't about me, it's about you.\" His focus then turned back toward himself, as he noted how he was the one who defeated Trump in most polls.\n\nHe then went on to talk about his son, making light of a false allegation by Trump that Hunter Biden had made $US1.5 billion in China.\n\n\"I wonder where the hell that money is, man, because I've got to pay tuitions,\" Biden said. \"God bless me!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he said aloud that he couldn't get into the \"mosh pit\" with Trump because the focus should be on issues like climate change and guns. After devoting several minutes to that, he said: \"I don't want to get sucked into this, what he likes to do.\"\n\nBiden's Post op-ed attempted to focus both on Trump's latest attacks, as well as a broader indictment of his presidency. He criticised the president on climate change and for not doing more to stand up for the rights of protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie,\" Biden wrote. \"President Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth - about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.\"\n\nBiden has bet that voters are familiar with his long tenure in public life, which he hopes will make him more resilient to Trump's attacks than earlier presidential targets.\n\n\"Please know that I'm not going anywhere,\" he wrote, addressing Trump. \"You won't destroy me, and you won't destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.\"\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Biden has alternated between pushing back on Trump and seeming unsure of how to handle a situation that has placed the focus on his son Hunter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5104%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_286%2C$y_61/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b50db49de5b6ad92fd3038eda450447559815c0e", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
