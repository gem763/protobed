That\u2019s what we\u2019re saying after watching Kylie Jenner and her daughter, Stormi, answer Ellen\u2019s Burning Questions. The segment, which aired on the Ellen DeGeneres Show yesterday, featured Jenner and her 19-month-old daughter answering a series of questions. But, of course, cuteness broke loose when Stormi stole the entire show.\n\nStarting things off, Stormi sat on her mom\u2019s lap while she played with what looks to be a paper-wrapped straw. Jenner began by explaining the biggest mess Stormi has ever made. \u201cRecently, she\u2019s really into M&Ms. She gets the M&Ms and she melts them in her hands.\u201d Looking at her daughter, Jenner added, \u201cAnd you put it all over my white couch, huh?\u201d Stormi just throws out the word \u201ccouch\u201d and the queen has obviously spoken. When asked what Stormi\u2019s go-to dance move is, Jenner responded with \u201chands in the air,\u201d and Stormi demonstrated.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nThe video then transitioned to questions about Jenner\u2019s long-time boyfriend, Travis Scott (Stormi\u2019s dad), and the funniest thing he\u2019s done. \u201cWhen him and Stormi play together, it\u2019s the most funny thing ever,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cThey scream and they yell and he makes her fly all over the house. They have so much fun together.\u201d When Stormi was asked who loves her most, she matter-of-factly said, \u201cDaddy.\u201d The highlight of Stormi\u2019s cuteness? As Jenner tried to discuss a \u201ccollab\u201d with her daughter, Stormi appeared to start saying \u201cCheese.\u201d\n\nJenner, who has talked about suffering from anxiety, also shared with Ellen her strangest fear: \u201cDust in a cup.\u201d Um, OK? The reality star followed up by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s one of my pet peeves, when there\u2019s a lot of dust in a cup. I think of it getting into my system.\u201d She must hate thrift stores!\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
