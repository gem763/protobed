In a briefing on Tuesday Oct. 1, Trump showed no interest when aides detailed North Korea\u2019s new efforts to develop missiles that can be fired from a submarine, two U.S. officials who participated in the White House briefing tell TIME. Trump decided talks with North Korea should continue despite that country\u2019s evident intention to develop the new military capability, the two officials say. North Korea is testing underwater missiles that could eventually give it the ability to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike from a submarine if it is attacked. Military officials assess that strategic advance will pose a significant new threat that requires more military resources to defend against, the officials told Trump during the meeting, which included Trump\u2019s new National Security Advisor, Robert O\u2019Brien.\n\nBut the President \u201cdidn\u2019t care\u201d and \u201cshowed no interest,\u201d one of the officials says, and decided the tests should not derail talks between U.S. and North Korean officials scheduled for the coming days. Those talks are designed to pave the way for a fourth face-to-face meeting between Trump and North Korea\u2019s autocratic leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nOfficials have put together incentives Trump can offer Kim in exchange for beginning to dismantle his nuclear program. Trump is prepared to offer Kim a three-year suspension of United Nations sanctions on textile and coal exports if Pyongyang agrees to dismantle its main nuclear facility at Yongbyon and halt its production of highly enriched uranium, said the two U.S. officials. If the United Nations is not willing to follow Trump\u2019s lead, one of the officials said, the U.S. could temporarily halt its enforcement of those sanctions, the officials said. The terms of the offer were first reported by Vox.\n\nAides have long found it difficult to get the President to focus on complex national security challenges, and U.S. national security officials have been dismayed to see Trump repeatedly raise domestic U.S. politics in important calls and meetings with foreign leaders. Trump repeatedly brings up his 2016 election victory with heads of state.\n\nRecently, he has gone a step further. Last month, he asked the Australian Prime Minister to help investigate the origins of the Russia probe and on July 25, he asked Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. During a call with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping in June, Trump brought up Biden\u2019s political prospects, as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to a CNN report.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham confirmed Trump had been briefed about North Korea, but said the description of him showing no interest in the threat is \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d \u201cOf course he has been briefed, that has always been the case and will not change. Everything else you have below is completely wrong and I\u2019m fine going on the record with that,\u201d Grisham wrote in an emailed response to questions from TIME.\n\nTrump\u2019s Oct. 1 briefing on North Korea came on a busy news day that saw Democrats push forward with their impeachment inquiry about Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine\u2019s help digging into Biden.\n\nAs that political scandal continued to consume Trump\u2019s attention, North Korea took additional steps. On Oct. 2, the day after Trump\u2019s North Korea briefing, Pyongyang launched a ballistic missile from a submerged barge that served as an underwater platform. The missile flew to an altitude of 575 miles and landed 280 miles from the launch site, according to U.S. intelligence officials, who estimate the solid fuel rocket, if it is operational, could have a range as long as 1,500 miles.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the missile, called the Pukguksong-3, is designed to be fired from a new submarine that Pyongyang is developing, one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cTogether, assuming they prove to be at least somewhat reliable, [these] two weapons would give North Korea a significant new second strike capability that would potentially raise the cost of any attack on [North Korea],\u201d despite the fact that the new boat is diesel-electric and relatively easy to locate and track, the official said.", "description": "Sources tell TIME that President Trump \"didn't care\" about a new North Korea missile threat and wants to move forward with talks with North Korea.", "authors": ["John Walcott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3SOcRWCQ6GY7.K88FQdoFQ--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/2748ca6216a6e30b5f2b450256c702f1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
