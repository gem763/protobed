Officers were told she had left the country on September 16 \u2013 using the diplomatic immunity belonging to her husband Jonathan.\n\nBut Harry's family say they were not informed by police until 10 days later. ITV News reports that the Foreign Office asked the police to delay telling them.\n\nHarry's mother Charlotte Charles told the broadcaster: 'It's disgusting. They've got to answer some questions we throw at them haven't they? Because who made that ridiculous decision?'\n\nShe called on Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to answer the family's questions, adding: 'He needs to do the right thing as well doesn't he and own up to why they made that decision.\n\nHarry Dunn's parents (Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles, pictured) are furious over claims the Foreign Office asked police to delay telling them that the US diplomat's wife accused of killing him had fled Britain\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, was killed in August when his motorcycle collided with a car allegedly driven by Anne Sacoolas outside a British air force base in Northamptonshire\n\n'Why keep us in the dark? Why add more pain?'\n\nHarry's father Tim added: 'Dominic Raab said to us when we had that meeting that they and the police were two separate things.'\n\nAlso today it was reported that Harry's parents have accused the government of abandoning them during their visit to the US, where they met President Donald Trump to discuss the case earlier this week.\n\nThey told the Daily Telegraph that they have been 'dismayed' by the lack of support from the Foreign Office.\n\nTim said: 'We don't understand why. Harry Dunn died in an accident and we feel that nobody wants us to get justice for him.\n\nCharlotte added: 'They want us to go away and forget about it all. they really do.\n\nBruce Charles, Charlotte's husband, added: 'Why haven't they come back with any information for us?'\n\nFloral tributes on the road outside RAF Croughton, in Northamptonshire, where Harry Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was involved in a head-on collision in August\n\n'\n\nHow events unfolded in the Harry Dunn case August 27: Motorcyclist Harry Dunn, 19, collides with a black Volvo XC90 on the B4031, Park End, in Croughton at around 8.25pm. Harry is taken to hospital but dies shortly afterwards. August 28: Northamptonshire Police speak with Anne Sacoolas, 42, the wife of a US diplomat and a suspect in the crash. Northamptonshire Police apply for a waiver for Mrs Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity. September 16: Northamptonshire Police is informed that the diplomatic waiver has been declined. It is also when Northamptonshire Police are first told that Mrs Sacoolas has left the UK sometime between August 28 and September 16 September 18: Hundreds of friends and family attend Harry Dunn's funeral at Banbury Crematorium. September 26: Harry's family is informed that Mrs Sacoolas has left the UK. October 2: Harry's family create the 'Justice 4 Harry' GoFundMe page to help pay for any legal costs needed to bring Anne Sacoolas back to the UK. October 4: Northamptonshire Police confirm in a statement that 'a 42-year-old American suspect' has left the UK October 5: US State Department says in a statement that diplomatic immunity is 'rarely waived'.October 6- Sky News name Anne Sacoolas as the suspect in the case.\n\nOfficers have stated the delay was in part due to Harry's funeral and they are determined to get justice for the family.\n\nThey declined to comment to ITV News on the allegation that they were asked by the Foreign Office to delay telling the Dunn family about Anne Sacoolas's departure.\n\nThe FCO has responded to the allegation in a statement saying, 'We have been doing all we can to help the family to secure justice for Harry.\n\n'The Prime Minister and the President spoke last week about this matter and the Foreign Secretary has made clear to the US Ambassador and Secretary Pompeo what has happened is not acceptable.\n\n'We continue to press for the individual concerned to engage with the UK legal process'\n\nEarlier this week Harry's parents travelled to the US, and met Donald Trump in the Oval Office after an 11th hour invitation from the president.\n\nIt emerged later that Trump repeatedly asked them to meet her as as she waited outside the Oval Office and when they resisted he told them: 'She's here so let's get some healing.\n\nThey told how the US President 'took their breath away' when he told them the woman who allegedly killed their son with her Volvo SUV outside an airbase in Britain was also in the White House.\n\nMrs Sacoolas, who claimed diplomatic immunity and fled the UK on a state-sponsored private jet last month, had been whisked from a secret location to Washington DC.\n\nYesterday Boris Johnson contradicted Donald Trump by insisting he did not ask him to set up a meeting between Harry's parents and Mrs Sacoolas.\n\nCharlotte Charles and Tim Dunn said the US President 'took their breath away' when he told them in the Oval Office that Anne Sacoolas was also in the White House and told them: 'She's here so let's get some healing'\n\nThe Prime Minister's spokesman said Mr Johnson was not aware of the US President's plans to arrange the meeting, despite the President claiming that Downing Street had asked him to do so.\n\n'The PM and the President spoke last Wednesday and the PM asked the President to do all he could to resolve the issue,' the spokesman said.\n\n'During the conversation, the President raised a possibility of a meeting with Anne Sacoolas at the White House but at that stage we weren't aware of any plans for the family to go (to the US) so it wasn't discussed further.'\n\n'FUGITIVE' WIFE COULD FACE ARREST IF SHE TRIES TO LEAVE US The wife of a US intelligence officer involved in a fatal collision that killed British teenager Harry Dunn could be handed an Interpol red notice, meaning she risks arrest if she ever leaves the US. Anne Sacoolas, 42, was wrongly granted diplomatic immunity after the crash in Northamptonshire on August 27 when she hit 19-year-old Mr Dunn's motorcycle. Northamptonshire Police said they would soon submit a case file on the crash to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. If Mrs Sacoolas is charged with causing death by careless driving, or a more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving, the force can issue an extradition request or a red notice by Interpol. This means she would be arrested as soon as she left US soil.\n\nMr Trump also made the incendiary claim that Harry\u2019s parents had wanted to meet Mrs Sacoolas - but changed their minds when they arrived.\n\nHarry\u2019s family have always insisted that they will only meet her once she has returned to the UK to face justice over the car crash.\n\nAfter telling the President that Mrs Sacoolas should stay away, Mrs Charles revealed: 'I spoke directly to Mr Trump for a good few minutes. He did seem sincere, he didn't try to interrupt me or cut me off.\n\n'At the end of the meeting it was him who took my hand and I squeezed it very tight. I said: 'You need to see, if this was your son you'd be doing the same thing'. He said: 'yes, yes I would' and I said: 'So please, please, do the right thing. Just try'. He squeezed my hand back and said he would 'try to push from another angle'.'\n\nBut she added: 'But if I'm totally honest, I don't hold out too much hope that she's going to be returned to us in the UK'.\n\nAsked if she could speak to Anne mother-to-mother and what she'd say, Charlotte said: 'I would just ask her to get on the plane and do the humane thing, do the right thing, set her children a good example.\n\n'She needs to do the right thing and make that decision herself to get back on the plane and come back to the UK and meet us on UK soil and face what she's actually done.'\n\nHarry Dunn's bereft parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn (right with spokesman Radd Seiger) appeared on Good Morning Britain with Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid from New York, where they have spent the week on a US TV media blitz\n\nPresident Trump, pictured yesterday in the Rose Garden with the Stanley Cup and the St. Louis Blues ice hockey team, is said to have promised to look at the case again 'at a new angle' after his offer of a meeting with Sacoolas was rebuffed\n\nBut she added: 'But if I'm totally honest, I don't hold out too much hope that she's going to be returned to us in the UK'.\n\nAsked if she could speak to Anne mother-to-mother and what she'd say, Charlotte said: 'I would just ask her to get on the plane and do the humane thing, do the right thing, set her children a good example.\n\nHarry died from his injuries after being hit on the wrong side of the road seven weeks ago\n\n'She needs to do the right thing and make that decision herself to get back on the plane and come back to the UK and meet us on UK soil and face what she's actually done.'\n\nDescribing his pride watching his ex-wife speak to Trump, Harry's father Tim said: 'Charlotte was so strong - I was so proud - Mr Trump was listening, I don't think he dared interrupt her. I like to think he's an honourable man and that he will keep his promise to try to another way to move things forward'.\n\nThe family's lawyer Radd Seiger has revealed he ended the talks after Mr Trump revealed the fugitive was next door - causing the President's national security adviser Robert O'Brien to declare loudly: 'She's not coming back [to Britain]'.\n\nHe said the White House had tried to turn the meeting into a press call with a bank of photographers ready to capture the moment Harry's parents met the woman who knocked down and killed their son.\n\nHe said: 'It was almost like: 'Hey I've got someone who wants to see you'. Then I looked to my side and I saw at least three photographers ready to do a press call'.\n\nBoris backs family's decision to reject White House meeting with Harry Dunn's killer Boris Johnson today backed the decision by Harry Dunn's parents to snub a meeting with Anne Sacoolas. The Prime Minister's spokesman said Mr Johnson 'fully supports' the decision of Harry Dunn's family not to meet the US suspect in the investigation into his death. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, parents of the 19-year-old motorcyclist who was killed in a hit-and-run, said they felt 'a little ambushed' after President Donald Trump offered to set-up a meeting with suspect Anne Sacoolas at the White House following a meeting on Tuesday. Mrs Sacoolas returned to the United States days after the August crash which killed Harry and sought diplomatic immunity via her marriage to a state official. The PM's spokesman said: 'I think it was absolutely a decision for the family as to how they chose to proceed when the president made that suggestion, and the Prime Minister fully supports the decision that they made.'\n\nHe added: 'The family feel a little ambushed to say the least and disappointed they made the effort to go all the way there and all the way back with little progress towards achieving the closure they are so desperately seeking'.\n\nHe added: 'It struck us that this meeting was hastily arranged by nincompoops on the run and in particular Mr O'Brien who appeared to be extremely uptight and aggressive and did not come across at all well in this meeting which required careful handling and sensitivity'.\n\nHarry's mother Charlotte told reporters outside the White House that Mr Trump had promised he would 'push it from a different angle' after they refused to see the woman next door.\n\nShe said: 'We are still more than willing to meet her, but we made it very clear that that needs to be on our terms, on UK soil. And we could still work with that justice system to do anything we could.'\n\nShe said that Trump held her hand during the meeting and she felt that he was sincere.\n\n'He's the one in control here, but we are in control of our situation as much as we can be. And we still want justice for Harry. And we will take it as far as we possibly can to ensure that that's done,' she added.\n\nNineteen-year-old Harry was killed in August when his motorcycle collided with a car driven by Sacoolas, who is a US diplomat's wife, outside a British air force base used by the Americans in Northamptonshire.\n\nHarry's parents said they were not given an idea of what Sacoolas wanted to say to them and Trump did not suggest that he would send Sacoolas back to the UK.\n\nCharlotte said that at the beginning of the meeting Trump ruled out Sacoolas returning to the UK but she added: 'I do feel that at the end when he said that he would try to push this from a different angle, there's that tiny little bit of hope that he will hopefully take another look and maybe work harder for us.'\n\nCharlotte said they 'were a bit shocked' that they were asked to meet with their son's alleged killer.\n\nWe are still more than willing to meet her, but we made it very clear that that needs to be on our terms, on UK soil. And we could still work with that justice system to do anything we could Harry Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles\n\nShe said: 'It's not appropriate to meet her without therapists and mediators, let alone for us as a family. But also to her. I don't think it's appropriate for her. How can it be comfortable for her to be thrown into a situation like that without therapists and mediators.'\n\nThe grieving mother added: 'I feel like we've got a little bit of progress. We didn't get the promises that we wanted. They couldn't tell us who made the decision to let her go back to the U.S. We asked how long she was there for. They still stated three weeks. We're not totally sure about that.'\n\nThe case has attracted widespread interest after Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity after the crash and flew back to the United States.\n\nSacoolas has not been charged with criminal wrongdoing but her claim of immunity and return to the U.S. provoked an uproar in Britain.\n\nTrump met Harry Dunn's parents, Charlotte Charles (pictured front) and Tim Dunn (in glasses above left), shown here speaking outside the White House yesterday\n\nHarry Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles is seen above addressing reporters alongside her husband Bruce Charles after leaving the White House on Tuesday evening\n\nEmotional: Harry's mother Charlotte Charles told reporters after the meeting: 'We are still more than willing to meet her, but we made it very clear that that needs to be on our terms, on UK soil.

Harry Dunn's father is seen above arriving in Washington DC Tuesday\n\nCharlotte Charles and her husband Bruce arrive at Union Station in Washington DC ahead of the White House meeting\n\nIt is seven weeks since Mrs Sacoolas collided with Harry's motorbike (pictured) on the road outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire\n\nUS Spy's wife's apology: 'Made us feel worse', says Harry Dunn's father Anne Sacoolas (pictured), 42, has yet to apology in her own words Harry's father Tim Dunn told the BBC's Today Programme Ms Sacoolas's statement through her lawyers apologising had made the situation 'a little bit worse'. 'Now she's admitted it, we don't understand why she's not coming back - she's admitted her guilt but we still can't get any further forward with getting her back for some justice for Harry.' When asked what the family planned to do next, he said: 'I think we're going to stick around for a couple of days just to see if things progress because it's just been like a snowball effect. 'We came on Sunday and within two days we've been to the White House. It's absolutely bizarre and we just don't know what the next day is likely to bring.' In an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, Ms Charles said she wasn't holding out too much hope that Ms Sacoolas would return. 'I think we're just going to just be forever disappointed, forever disgusted in both the UK and US governments. It just doesn't make sense to us as to why on earth this should be allowed to happen,' she said. She added: 'We didn't embark on this without putting some really good thought into it. He would have done the same for anyone of us. 'We owe it to him to honour him and do our absolute best to get justice for Harry. If that doesn't come in the way we want it, we will continue to work and we will try and get those diplomatic laws looked at.'\n\nHarry's father Tim Dunn said after the meeting: 'The president was very professional and he spoke very well to us. He listened to Charlotte very well. She spoke excellent to him, and he was understanding. And I think he generally will look to try and resolve this is a way to help us.'\n\nCharlotte said she thinks Harry would have been proud of them taking their fight to the White House.\n\nShe said: 'He would have been very proud. Really proud. He was always one to stand up for his rights when he knew he was in the right. He was - he would do everything that he could possibly do to make sure that he had that heard.\n\n'Anyone that he felt was being served any injustice. You know, somebody that wasn't being kind to another person. He would have their back. He would be really proud. He is riding the skies up there now and pushing us on to continue to do him proud. And more than anything, now, do his twin brother and his siblings proud.'\n\nTim Dunn added: 'He would've been proud. He'd have probably had a laugh about it (being at the White House) as well. Probably, knowing Harry. And I think he'd be pleased that we've been doing the best that we can. He knew right from wrong, and I think he knows we're trying to get it right for him.'\n\nThey did not say how long they spent with the president but said 'they didn't try to rush us out'.\n\nDunn's parents had brought their case directly to U.S. audiences this week, holding a New York news conference and urging Sacoolas to return to Britain.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday Sacoolas revealed that she had spoken to Harry before he died as she admitted for the first time she was driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nSacoolas, 42, said she had 'no time to react' when the teenager came towards her on his motorbike over a hill.\n\nA statement issued by her lawyers said: 'Anne stayed on the scene of the accident to assist. She spoke to Harry Dunn to tell him that she would call for help.'\n\nIn her first account of what happened, she also said she flagged down another driver and then went to comfort her own children, who were in her crashed Volvo SUV.\n\nThe mother of three who flew home to the U.S. on a state-sponsored private jet, said she was 'terribly, terribly sorry for that tragic mistake'.\n\nHarry's family, who met Foreign Secretary Dominic Rabb in the UK last week, have also demanded an investigation over the Foreign Office's (FCO) advice to Northamptonshire Police that Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity.\n\nThey are demanding to see all emails, messages and notes sent in relation to her immunity status.\n\nSpeaking in New York, family spokesman Radd Seiger said: 'We want to conduct an investigation into the FCO's decision to advise Northamptonshire Police that this lady had the benefit of diplomatic immunity.'\n\nUS Spy's wife brings in lawyer who represents extradition suspects and used to work at US Embassy in London The US spy's wife has brought in a lawyer who is an expert in extradition cases who used to work at the American Embassy in London. Amy Jeffress is a Partner at Arnold & Porter, specialising in criminal defence, national security, international law. Before this, she worked for the US Justice Department at the U.S. Embassy in London Before joining Arnold & Porter, Ms Jeffress served as the Justice Department Attach\u00e9 to the US Embassy in London, where she coordinated cooperation between US and UK authorities on criminal matters\n\nIf they are not happy with the documents, the family say they will then ask for a judge's opinion on the lawfulness of the FCO's decision.\n\nAfter the meeting with Trump Seiger said: 'Weren't sure what the basis of the meeting was. That wasn't made clear to us. We came in good faith and I have to say the president was warm when we met him. He was generous, he extended his condolences, I thought, perfectly appropriately. And he made it clear that he understood the family's situation.'\n\nHe added that being asked to meet with Sacoolas was a 'surprise'.\n\nHe said: 'We had resolved that that's not something we were prepared to do at this moment. This family still is emotionally shut down. And that, as you can all imagine, was potentially difficult ... in the White House without therapists or mediators around us, I thought. So we declined that offer.\n\n'Charlotte did an amazing job of engaging with President Trump...As we walked out he said, 'OK I'll take another look.' But again there's no commitment. When is he going to take another look? And when is going to come back to us by. So my view is, look, dialogue is always good. We were very pleased to be here. It was certainly, I think, not a bad meeting. But we are no further on in terms of getting what we want, which is having Mrs. Sacoolas return to the UK. And in fact that was made pretty clear to us at one point, that that was never going to happen.'\n\nTo donate to the family's fund click HERE", "description": "The teenager's mother Charlotte and father Tim (pictured)  say they are 'disgusted' over claims Northamptonshire Police told them Anne Sacoolas had left the UK ten days after officers found out.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/07/19872462-0-image-a-24_1571380255548.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
