Financial journalists pin the blame on worries about the fallout from the impeachment investigation. Sitting here in South Africa, it seems strange that the market is skittish because of an impeachment process that won't get further than the House of Representatives. For impeachment to be successful, both the House and the Senate need to vote for it. The Republicans control the Senate, and they don't have any incentive to impeach Trump for something as mild as his telephone conversation with the Ukrainians. Politics is all about getting votes, not running countries or making laws. For the Republicans, Trump is still their best bet of getting the votes to be in the White House after the 2020 elections.\n\n\n\nYesterday the closed up 0.72%, the closed down 0.24%, and the closed down 0.58%.\n\nOne thing, from Paul\n\n\n\nAs you know, Vestact advises clients to invest in the healthcare sector. Our thinking is that once productivity has risen to the extent that humanity has switched to a four day work week, and we spend all of our time hiking, watching Netflix and interacting on social media, our attention will turn to prolonging our lives.\n\n\n\nGenetic therapies to re-engineer human cells are of great interest because in time they will allow humanity to arrest diseases before they have a chance to occur. If we are all going to live longer, we will also have to get on top of Alzheimer's and dementia. In the meantime, pharmaceutical research will focus on treatments to combat the diseases that kill the most people. Those are probably circulatory (heart) problems and cancer.\n\n\n\nThe current default treatments for cancer are the twin sledgehammers of chemotherapy and radiation, which kill almost all quickly dividing cells. The patient hopes that cancer goes away and they go into remission. This approach is often not very effective.\n\n\n\nClearly, what we need are targeted therapies that reverse specific cancers. The problem is that cancer cells are heterogeneous, even within the same tumour. They grow and divide with extreme rapidity. Often, some cancer cells survive initial treatment and evolve further. They also evade our immune system or suppress key elements of the usual immune response. This is why cancer immunotherapy, using the body's own immune system to target and destroy cancer cells, is one of the most exciting fields in biomedical research. Fight fire with fire, as they say.\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical investment in cancer treatments has risen drastically over the past decade, as has spent on cancer drugs, but the results have been comparatively small, University of California Hastings College law professor Robin Feldman argues in a recent Washington Post op-ed.\n\n\n\nAlthough efforts to declare \"war on cancer\" go back to the 1970s they have yielded less than one might expect. The overall death rate from cancer has fallen only 5 percent since 1950, which some attribute primarily to the decline in smoking since the 1990s rather than research. Cancer drugs approved between 2003 and 2013 increased survival by an average of 3.4 months. That's not a lot, but I guess it's a start.\n\n\n\nStocks to hold that will benefit from this research effort include Amgen, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) and Illumina (NASDAQ: ).\n\n\n\n\n\nByron's Beats\n\n\n\nSouth African fintech is thriving. We have always been very innovative in that department. Maybe it is because we were initially under-serviced in that sector, and now that new technology is available there is a big market segment looking for solutions.\n\n\n\nThis Ventureburn article talks about a few startups who have received funding recently. In the first half of 2019, over R188 million was invested in fintech startups. That is 37% of the disclosed SA tech startup deals.\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine it is the banks who are making most of these big investments. They have the money available and they need to stick with the times. Essentially they are the ones being disrupted by these innovative ideas.\n\n\n\nThe article covers each bank and lists the startups they have invested in. It is a very interesting read and you can see who is behind some of these familiar brands.\n\nBright's Banter\n\n\n\nThe exercise bike and treadmill company Peloton, IPO'ed yesterday at a price of $29 per share. This was on the higher end of the range which was set between $26 and $29 per share. The company was able to raise $1.2 billion at a valuation of $8 billion; this was twice as high as its most recent round of funding.\n\n\n\nThe IPO was seen as a success regardless of the fact that the shares closed down 11%.The company loses about $200 million per year but has very high margins, meaning that at the right scale, this business could be uber profitable. The problem currently is the rise of competition like Zwift and Mirror.\n\n\n\nI will be watching this company with keen interest because they have a very simple business model that I understand. The company also happens to benefit from a long-term change in human behaviour as we want to eat nutritious foods, be healthy and live a well-balanced life. The same trends that have helped Lululemon and Nike.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone for a R260 KitKat bar? There will be 1 500 different flavour combinations, including Earl Grey or G&T. It might be a bit pricey but it does get people talking about the brand - Luxury 'bespoke' KitKat candy bar to be sold in the UK for up to $17 each.\n\n\n\n\n\ncan result in greater levels of carbon-dioxide being transferred from our atmosphere and into the soil.

They acquired Buccellati, a renowned Italian jewellery Maison. The stock is up 1.5% in early trade. The JSE All-share is higher this morning and the Rand is weaker than the $/R 15.00 level.
