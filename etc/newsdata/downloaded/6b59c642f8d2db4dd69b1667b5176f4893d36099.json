I can't stop working .\n\n\"I decided to move out of the Premier League because I am too linked with Arsenal. I had opportunities to work in England but I turned them down.\"", "description": "The \u00a372 million signing has not hit the ground running since his arrival as Gunners fans may have hoped", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534800.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-v-AFC-Bournemouth-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
