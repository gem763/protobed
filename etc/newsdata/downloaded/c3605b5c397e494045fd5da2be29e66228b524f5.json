Mrs Rainbow has four children ranging in age from nine to 17 years. They have been living in their four-bedroom home for 15 years.\n\nDuring that period, stamp duty on a median-priced property rose 189 per cent in Brisbane, Domain analysis shows. It is the same story around the country, with the smallest increase 85 per cent in Perth.\n\n\"It's like our money was disappearing into the air,\" she said. \"We were not using it for anything tangible.\"\n\nThe family liked the area so they shelved plans to move and used the money they would have spend on stamp duty and moving costs on renovating the house and landscaping the garden.\n\nAccording to analysis by Canstar, which monitors property markets, homeowners are remaining in their houses for 11.3 years, or about four years longer than they did a decade ago.\n\nStamp duty for a median-price house has increased nearly 190 per cent in some cities since 2004, according to Domain, while average earnings across the country have risen by only 21 per cent.\n\nThis has contributed to annualised real estate turnover falling to just 3.3 per cent in the first three months of the year, the lowest on record, according to global investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrendan Coates, program director for household finances at the Grattan Institute, said: \u201cWe have made it much harder for people to move. This is impeding economic growth because people are less likely to take new job opportunities that involve relocation.\u201d\n\nAnn Rainbow. Attila Csaszar\n\nRevenue-starved state governments have made minimal changes to stamp duty thresholds despite rising property prices.\n\nPatrick Bright, a buyers\u2019 agent, added: \u201cI am having more conversations with home owners who would like to move but end up deciding to renovate what they have first, and only move when they can\u2019t make their existing home accommodate their current family needs.\u201d\n\nRenovating is a \u201crelatively low-risk strategy and allows the owner to manufacture capital value\u201d, he added.", "description": "Stamp duty has increased by 189 per cent since the Rainbow family moved into their home.
