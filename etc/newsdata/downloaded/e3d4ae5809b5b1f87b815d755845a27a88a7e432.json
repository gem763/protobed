Jonas is set to join the singing competition in spring 2020. USA TODAY\n\nThe gloves are off!\n\nThe contestants on \"The Voice\" stepped into the ring Tuesday during Night 2 of the NBC show's Battles, and it's safe to say that some singers came with knockout punches.\n\nKatie Kadan, 38 and Destiny Rayne, 23, provided the \"moment of the night,\" according to Usher, a former \"Voice\" coach and current adviser for Team Legend.\n\n\"This is my favorite performance coming,\" added Legend, the reigning champ and V-EGOT winner. \"This is how you want to close a show.\"\n\nLegend assigned the explosive duo Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer\" and the ladies didn't disappoint with a showstopping duet filled with \"power, ferocity and intensity.\" They earned a standing ovation. \"That\u2019s the first time all four of us stood up and clapped,\" Kelly Clarkson said.\n\nLast night on 'The Voice': John Legend serenades, rejects, saves one singer \u2013 all in the same episode\n\n\"It was really thrilling to watch. I think America is very happy they got to witness this beautiful moment onstage,\" Legend added. But he could only pick one singer to advance to the Knockouts after using his save yesterday. (Each coach gets one steal and one save during the Battles.)\n\nLegend picked Kadan, a four-chair turn, to stay: \"Katie, Lord Jesus. Your voice just sounds like magic. \u2026 People need to see and hear you.\"\n\nIs Legend's 'mojo' back? John Legend thinks he lost his 'mojo' after shocking Blake Shelton defeat\n\nThat performance was a MOMENT and I\u2019m glad we all got to see that together! Good for you @GwenStefani! #VoiceBattles \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) October 16, 2019\n\nRayne's time on the show, however, was not over, because Shelton used his steal! But, not so fast. Just as Shelton wrapped his arms around Destiny to congratulate her on joining his team, Stefani hit her button to steal his thunder. (And possibly, his singer.)\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Shelton yelled. \"I was trying to be a hero.\"\n\nIt was now up to Rayne to pick which team she would join.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to fight with my girlfriend, but I\u2019m willing to for you,\" Shelton said, prompting Stefani to reply, \"Whoa!\" He added, \"I was willing to use my only steal I have on you.\"\n\nThe country artist played the seniority card, again. \"I have won this show more seasons than Gwen has been a coach,\" Shelton added.\n\n'The Voice': Blake Shelton throws epic temper tantrum after losing four-chair turn\n\nTHE VOICE -- \"Blind Auditions\" -- Pictured: (l-r) Gwen Stefani, John Legend, Blake Shelton -- (Photo by: Trae Patton/NBC) (Photo: Trae Patton, NBC)\n\nStefani clapped back, \"He has the most seasons on this show, but I have the longest career.\" The No Doubt rocker's pitch was better, because Rayne joined Team Stefani.\n\n\"You broke up America\u2019s couple,\" Shelton yelled. \"The tabloids are coming.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Stefani said the couple averted a crisis: \"Blake was almost sleeping on the couch tonight, so Destiny made the right choice and so all is going to be fine.\"\n\nShelton gets another consolation prize: He gets his steal back, and can use it on another contestant.\n\n\"The Voice continues Monday at 8 EDT/PDT on NBC.\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\n'The Voice': Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton go head-to-head over four-chair turn\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/15/the-voice-blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-battle-over-double-steal/3991522002/", "description": "\"The Voice\" contestants stepped into the ring during Night 2 of the Battles, and it's safe to say, some singers came with knockout punches.", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published P.M.
