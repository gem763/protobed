Jade and Tiffany Mills of Coldwell Banker have the listing.\n\n\n\nThe Balinese decor-inspired home is set on 1.44 acres in Holmby Hills, an affluent neighborhood in Los Angeles that's well-known for its sprawling Hollywood estates.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe location is triple-A,\u201d Jade Mills said. Tiffany Mills agreed, saying that the relatively large lot is completely secluded while still being close to town.\n\n\n\nTucked behind a long, gated driveway off a cul-de-sac, \u201cmany people didn\u2019t even know the house was there,\u201d Jade Mills said.\n\n\n\nThe 4,770-square-foot house comprises four bedrooms and five bathrooms, according to the listing. Visitors enter the home\u2019s open-concept living room and chef\u2019s kitchen through double doors flanked by lily ponds, listing photos show. Exposed wood beams along the cathedral ceilings and detailed wood columns decorate the living room. Floor-to-ceiling windows run throughout, offering views of the lush greenery, in-ground pool and the city beyond.\n\n\n\nJade Mills said that Ms. Tiegs, 71, feels the house is her retreat. \u201cShe feels that when she comes home, she has total peace,\u201d Jade Mills said.\n\n\n\nTiffany Mills said that while the house is very open and airy, it also has its cozy spaces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re building these very large square-footage houses,\u201d Tiffany Mills said of the developers in the Holmby Hills area. \u201cThis is, in comparison, sort of a smaller, cozier house.\u201d She said that the buyer will be someone who will either appreciate its intimacy or a developer that will knock it down to make use of its lot size and location.\n\n\n\nMore: Buyers Are Filled With Options in London Despite Real Estate Market\u2019s Uncertainty\n\nOutside the one-story house, there is also a three-car garage, and additional parking space in the spacious roundabout driveway, and decorative ponds and fountains.\n\n\n\nThe 4,777-square-foot house listed unsuccessfully twice before, once in 2013 for $12 million and again in 2015 for $15 million, according to listing records.\n\n\n\nRecords show that Ms. Tiegs purchased the house in 1996 for $2.49 million and has since undertaken several renovations to the property, including updates to electric and plumbing, additions to the main house and the installation of a pool.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: The Perks of Health Savings Accounts\n\nMs. Tiegs has appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s Swimsuit Issue three times and was dubbed the \u201cAll-American Model\u201d by Time Magazine in 1978. Aside from her modeling career, Ms. Tiegs is an avid health and fitness spokesperson\n\n\n\nMs. Tiegs was unavailable for comment.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Miabelle Salzano"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-110477?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
