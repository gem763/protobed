However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nAs much as I dislike vacuuming, I hate dirty floors even more, so in my case it's the lesser of two evils. Since I find vacuuming such a tedious task, when I do choose to do it, I'd like to make it as easy as possible on myself. I don't want to lug around a heavy machine. I don't want to maneuver an annoying card around. And I do not, under any circumstances, want to use a vacuum with ineffective suction that forces me to go over areas twice. Ideally, I'd have a vacuum like the Dyson v7 Animal, which just so happens to be on sale right now.\n\nCurrently over on Dyson's website, they're selling the v7 Animal for $200, which is a hefty $100 off its usual asking price. While Dyson is renowned for their award-winning vacuums, they usually cost quite the chunk of change, but not today. Dyson continuously ranks at the top when we test vacuums, so it's always a safe brand to choose from if you want a well-made vacuum that's built to last.\n\nLightweight and cordless, the v7 is slim enough to clean those hard-to-reach areas, and can run for up to 30 minutes on a single charge. It even converts to a handheld vacuum to reach all those nooks and crannies in your home, and comes with a bunch of interchangeable heads to help you get the deepest clean possible. It lands right between the V6 and the V8 in terms of power and performance, which both ranked highly in our testing. In all truth, you really can't go wrong with this guy, especially when you're getting such a steep discount.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
