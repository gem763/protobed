I began questioning why one of the world\u2019s most ancient, exclusive and sustainable natural fibres was relatively unknown, particularly in SA, which produces the majority of the world\u2019s mohair.\n\n\n\nI became determined to produce a local product that highlights mohair\u2019s unique qualities, ultimately resulting in the establishment of Frances V.H Mohair Rugs last year.\n\nWhere did you get capital to start the company and cover overheads?\n\nThe business has been self-funded. We manage to keep overheads low, since everything is sold online and made-to-order. Clients also have to put down a deposit on orders, which further reduces risks.\n\nFunding would go a long way in helping our business grow and reach its full potential.\n\n\n\nWe are looking specifically to work with parties that share our sustainable business practices and complement the intricacies of a small and unique business.\n\nWhere do you get your design inspiration?\n\nFrom the Karoo; the simple sophistication of its landscape, vegetation, and architecture informs the colour pallet and textures of our range.\n\n\n\nEvery step of the process is made by hand by a group of highly skilled women in the Eastern Cape.\n\n]The process takes approximately four to six weeks, depending on the size of the rugs and the intricacy of the design.\n\nDo you use mohair from the family farm?\n\nWe use very specific mohair, which is best suited to rug making \u2013 mainly the courser, stronger mohair perfect for durability, yet soft underfoot.\n\n\n\nMy family farm specialises in high-end mohair used mainly for luxury apparel. My long-term plan is to diversify the Frances V.H brand, to include products made from mohair produced on the farm.\n\nHow do you market your product?\n\nAs a start-up we have had to be creative in coming up with a cost-effective marketing plan.\n\n\n\nSocial media has been a successful platform to share our story, educate and explain the process and engage with a wider audience.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been fortunate in that the story and the product speaks for itself, which has lead to fantastic media coverage.\n\nMohair South Africa, a non-profit industry body that, along with other functions, markets and promotes mohair fibre, have been a fabulous support.\n\n\n\nThey have taken some of our rugs, along with a selection of South African mohair products, to various international trade shows and exhibitions.\n\n\n\nThis has proven to be excellent brand exposure and a great way of testing foreign markets.\n\nI have also been fortunate enough to work on collaborations with a couple of brilliant brands that share our ethical values and views on sustainable products.\n\n\n\nCollaborating with local handbag designer Thalia Startes, for example, led us to being part of the Zeitz MOCAA Gallery Store.\n\nHow competitive is the market in which you play?\n\nThe high-end lifestyle and d\u00e9cor market is extremely competitive. We are fortunate in that we offer a product that is so unique that it stands out from the rest.\n\n\n\nThere are very few local rug manufacturers in SA, and the market is big enough to support brands such as ours producing small volumes of custom-made pieces.\n\nWho is your market?\n\nBecause of the nature of our business, we only work on custom-made orders.\n\n\n\nOur client base is therefore a collection of decorators, designers and private clients who have an appreciation for natural, uniquely local, handcrafted, sustainable products.\n\n\n\nThey, in effect, are often involved in the design process and become part of our team, as we weave their orders together.\n\nThe international demand for our rugs is also growing, mainly from the US and Europe and we have recently sent our first order to China.\n\nWhat has been one of your biggest challenges so far ?\n\nWhen it comes to remote production our biggest challenges are logistical ones; mainly transport and access to basic connectivity, which makes communication via cellphones and emails difficult.\n\nHow has the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)\u2019s recent claims of animal abuse in mohair production affected the local industry?\n\nThe organisation has structured information to suggest that the malpractice of a few isolated farming incidents provide a true reflection on SA\u2019s entire Angora goats farming community.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t so, but we abhor any incidents of the mistreatment of animals and agree these allegations should be properly investigated.\n\n\n\nSA produces more than half the world\u2019s mohair and any boycott would have a devastating effect on the industry, the animals and the thousands of people it employs.\n\n\n\nWe believe that it is time for full supply chain visibility so that buyers can trace mohair fibre back to individual farms. This would also create value for producers and consumers.\n\nWhat is the industry doing to address this issue?\n\nThe industry is in the process of further developing its animal welfare code, which would be verified by third parties as an international stamp of good, sustainable production practices.\n\nMohair SA issued a statement in which it said that they are \u201ccommitted to the sustainability of the mohair industry, not only in South Africa, but globally\u201d.\n\n\n\nIt is a member of Textile Exchange, a global non-profit that, according to Mohair SA, \u201cidentifies and shares best practices regarding farming, materials, processing, traceability and product end-of-life in order to reduce the textile industry\u2019s impact on the environment\u201d.\n\nThe truth is that Angora goats are farmed for their fibre (mohair). Our animal husbandry is not only humane and ethical, but it makes good business sense.\n\n\n\nIt is in our interest to see mohair flourish; this is not possible without healthy animals.\n\nWhat are your growth plans for the business?\n\nI hope to set up a production facility on our farm in Prince Albert.\n\n\n\nThis will serve as a place where people can see the entire process, from the land, the goats and all the practices and preparing that goes into creating a rug.\n\nWe aim to employ skilled artisans in the area and to develop a training facility whereby we preserve and ensure the continuation of traditional craftsmanship.\n\nThe vision is to develop a range of mohair products to create an entirely integrated and vertical supply chain; from farm to product.\n\n\n\nMy hope is that SA becomes synonymous with mohair; not only for producing the top mohair in the world but also for outstanding end products.\n\nWhat has been the best business advice you have received so far?\n\nPut in the hours, do the research, actively seek advice in areas you don\u2019t understand or are weak in and then \u2018start\u2019. I find that overanalysing things in the fear that we don\u2019t have all the answers can become paralysing. For me, starting and seeing where that led to proved to be exactly the right thing to do at the right time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Frances van Hasselt is breathing new life into the mohair textile industry with her unique handcrafted mohair rugs.", "authors": ["Glenneis Kriel"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7927/58453587c0d1460aacee2470b41201c6.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-12"}
