The ICEYE satellite uses radar to look through the clouds, allowing it to take pictures even while the rain continues to fall. The image shows that vast sections of Grand Bahama Island, including its main airport, are now flooded. The land that remains above water appears nearly black in the image.\n\nThe storm hit the island late Sunday as a Category 5 hurricane and then stalled, bringing a storm surge of up to 23 feet above normal levels in some areas. Some parts of the island are expected to get at least 30 inches of rain, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm's core finally began moving away on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDorian is tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest storm to hit land in the Atlantic.\n\nThe Red Cross estimates that as many as 13,000 houses might have been damaged or destroyed on Grand Bahama Island and the neighboring Abaco Islands, which also saw extensive flooding and where at least five people were killed. The organization is also concerned that salt water may have contaminated wells, worsening the potential humanitarian crisis.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian hit Sunday as a Category 5 hurricane and then essentially parked itself over the island.", "authors": ["Geoff Brumfiel", "Alyson Hurt"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/03/reprocessed-bahamas-iceye-sar-imagery-09-02-2019-1144localtime_wide-c96ed68d7539ba45c7d6d5043be8f86a7c004fd4.jpg?s=1400"}
