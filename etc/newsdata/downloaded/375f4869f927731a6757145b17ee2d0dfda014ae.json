Johnson doesn\u2019t have the greatest track record for \u2014 how shall we say this? \u2014 veracity. Betting markets are pricing in just a one-in-five chance of a so-called hard Brexit, and, if financial markets really thought the U.K. was about to crash out without a deal, the pound GBPUSD, -0.2195% would be trading closer to $1.15 than its current level of about $1.23.\n\nStill, a 20% chance isn\u2019t nothing. And financial markets have been wrong before.\n\nSo then the question is how: How do you prepare?\n\nThere is a British government website covering what \u201cyou\u201d need to do. It includes sections on preparing your business, visiting the EU after Brexit, living and working in the EU, and remaining in the U.K. if you\u2019re an EU citizen.\n\nWhich is helpful for some, but not for this particular you, who, like most of the 66 million people who live here, is not dealing with any of those scenarios.\n\nThe official document outlining what could happen during a no-deal Brexit isn\u2019t terribly reassuring.\n\nThere will be food \u2014 but less choice, and less of it, and prices may go up. \u201cCertain\u201d types of fresh food (tomatoes? spinach?) won\u2019t be available. The sandwich industry is properly alarmed. And there\u2019s a risk of panic buying that will cause, or make worse, food-supply issues.\n\nThere will be medical supplies, but again, less of them \u2014 the U.K. may have world-class drug makers, but much of the actual medicine is produced abroad.\n\nThere will be fuel \u2014 hey, the North Sea is right there, and it\u2019s full of oil \u2014 but there could be border delays leading to traffic queues, which could disrupt supplies in London and the southeast, which, conveniently, is where I live.\n\nWater should be fine, but, also, maybe not.\n\nThe police in the meantime may be busy dealing with protesters. And counterprotesters. And there may be a rise in public disorder.\n\nAnd there are four sentences so alarming that they were blacked out. Who knows, the aliens at Stonehenge rely on Brie.\n\nAgain, this is all in the official document, given the code name Yellowhammer, who was the Greek god of Brexit.\n\nThe U.K. government maintains that the report represents a worst-case scenario, though the pro-Brexit newspaper which uncovered it said it was the base case.\n\nIt\u2019s probably reasonable to expect some degree of improvement in preparations given that the document was written in August, but how much? This is the same government whose elaborate maneuvers keep getting blown up in Parliament, by a Labour Party that incredibly has not yet staked out a position on whether it supports or opposes the whole Brexit idea.\n\nSo what is a rational response?\n\nA quick, informal survey around the office, which includes Leavers and Remainers alike, finds no one here has a bunker. But it bears mentioning that journalists are terrible at math, and worse at properly assessing tail risks.\n\nThen again, I live within walking distance of no fewer than five supermarkets. And work stone\u2019s throw from one of the oldest food markets in the country. And, if things really get bad, won\u2019t we all just hop on a train, or an airplane, and leave? Brexit won\u2019t repeal the laws of physics, right?\n\nWell, assuming we can get to an airport.\n\nSo, yes, I can report one Brexit supermarket trip. I now possess plenty of long-lasting milk, quite a bit of pasta that\u2019ll probably never get eaten, a few cans of tomatoes and some green beans. (I make a pretty good green-bean casserole, for what it\u2019s worth.)\n\nHmm.\n\nThings aren\u2019t going to go well in an all-out Armageddon.\n\nBut that\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nProbably.", "description": "So how do you get ready for Brexit anyway?
