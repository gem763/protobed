It said that it violated local law and Apple guidelines.\n\nMr Cook then defended his firm's decision, claiming the app had been used 'maliciously to target individual officers for violence', according to a leaked email.\n\nApple's move immediately prompted accusations that the firm was putting business interests above human rights.\n\n'This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law.
