Ms Davidson\u2019s former pollster Lord Cooper said Tories risked being \u201celiminated\u201d as a major force in Scottish politics.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Some 48 per cent said they expected taxes to rise as a result of Brexit, against just 5 per cent who think they will fall.\n\nLord Cooper said: \u201cThis poll sends a very serious warning to the Conservative and Unionist Party in Scotland. Boris Johnson\u2019s threat to them is not that he will be a bump in the road on a slow but continuing recovery, but that he will effectively eliminate them overnight as a major force in Scottish politics.\n\n\u201cAsking Scottish voters to choose between their British and their European identities and forcing Scottish voters to back a nationalist agenda that might work in some parts of England looks as though it will spectacularly backfire.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the SNP group in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said: \u201cThis stunning poll underlines the strength of opposition to Brexit in Scotland.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s reckless plans for an extreme Brexit would be devastating \u2013 threatening to destroy 100,000 Scottish jobs and inflict lasting harm on living standards, public services, and the economy. It is shameful that Scottish Tory MPs have completely failed to oppose them.\u201d\n\nFollowing a visit to Aberdeenshire on Friday, Mr Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds were having dinner with the Queen and spending the night at Balmoral before returning to London.\n\nThe PM\u2019s traditional long autumn weekend with the sovereign at her Scottish estate was cut short because of the current political crisis.\n\nYouGov questioned 887 people in Conservative-held seats in Scotland between 28 August and 4 September.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives face a wipe-out in Scotland if a general election is called, with all 13 of the party\u2019s seats north of the border set to fall to the SNP amid widespread rejection of his \u201cdo or die\u201d Brexit message, according to new polling.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/16/boris-bull.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
