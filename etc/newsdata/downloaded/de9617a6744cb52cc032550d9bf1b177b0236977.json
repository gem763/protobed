The blue waters, as crisp as a winter snap.\n\nWe could see the catamarans departing from the pier, tourists eager to photograph sea lions and penguins. They will pass the Lighthouse at the End of the World and return home with postcard memories.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s the less obvious journey that we miss out on. The path not taken.\n\nWhen we first began our ascent earlier that morning, entering Reserva Natural Cerro Alark\u00e9n, an Argentinian national park within the Tierra del Fuego Province, the detour seemed a foolish one. Everyone else was out at sea. That\u2019s where the real sights were.\n\nPeat bogs can be found in many parts of the nature reserve More\n\nOr are they?\n\nAt least the path, in the beginning, is strikingly clear. While we see no one else as we trod slowly uphill, we conclude rangers must have maintained the hiking routes.\n\nRangers or invisible fellow hikers we have yet to spot. (Or someone, or something, else?)\n\nWith over 247 acres of native forests, the Reserva Natural Cerro Alark\u00e9n offers panoramic views of rugged mountain ranges from the scenic Mount Olivia to the imposing Five Sisters Mountain that guides our way. It\u2019s impossible to miss: it\u2019s the mountain with five peaks, hence its fantastical name.\n\nAs we are still at the lower altitudes, taking our time with our walk (which will become a real climb once the incline gets steeper), we soon come across a peat bog. Practically a marshland.\n\nAutumnal colours (left); 'fachine', a species of daisies native to Tierra del Fuego (right) More\n\nPeat bogs can be found in many parts of the nature reserve and contributes to the regional ecosystem.\n\nThe ground we step on is soft and easy on our soles, as it is often covered with sphagnum moss that favours the low temperatures.\n\nNot all hikes have to be a trial. The easier the going is, the more peace of mind we\u2019ll have to contemplate our immediate experience.\n\nFor one, it\u2019s wonderfully quiet but for the occasional snatches of birdsong. As Rumi, the 13th-century Islamic scholar and Sufi mystic, puts it: \u201cThe quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.\u201d For the Persian poet, there is eloquence to be found in silence.\n\nSilence can be helpful too, in uncovering some surprising companions as you hike. Don\u2019t be alarmed to encounter some horses during your nature ramble.\n\nThey were introduced to the island by European settlers and now roam the land, making the mountains of Tierra del Fuego their home.\n\nStory continues", "description": "USHUAIA (Argentina), Oct 25 \u2014 From halfway up the mountain, we could see the wide expanse of the Beagle Channel.
