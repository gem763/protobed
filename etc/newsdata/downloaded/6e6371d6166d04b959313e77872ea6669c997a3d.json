Several people were injured in scuffles between the police and those who had abducted the mayor.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nIn an earlier incident four months ago, a group of men trashed his office when they did not find him there.\n\nIn the lead-up to the mayoral election in Las Margaritas, Mr Escand\u00f3n was himself arrested on suspicion of taking part in a brawl with supporters of a rival candidate.\n\nHe was released for lack of evidence.", "description": "Locals say the mayor in southern Chiapas did not fulfil his campaign promise of repairing a road.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/87B0/production/_109163743_d3a80e85-e039-43c1-b8f0-7a356201d1c0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
