Then welcome to Start Here, a recurring guide to the best comedy podcasts available \u2014 and our recommendations for which episodes are the best entry points to your next auditory obsession.\n\nMurder can be funny \u2014 everything from Weekend at Bernie\u2019s to Death at a Funeral proves that point \u2014 as long as the gory details remain palatably vague. Yet a soft touch is not what several million listeners have come to expect when they download episodes of My Favorite Murder, Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark\u2019s \u00dcber-popular true-crime podcast for the Exactly Right network, every Thursday.\n\nThe public appetite for true crime is at its zenith despite (or because of) the fact that consuming it as entertainment is morally dubious. But Kilgariff and Hardstark are connoisseurs of the tastefully macabre, and their show, which revisits mysterious and tragic deaths in history, rarely avoids the most gruesome tales. Both hosts are broadcast veterans, however, so while the tones of their stories toggle between frightening and unexpectedly effervescent, they are never morose.\n\nThis daring mix of tragedy and comedy has earned the podcast a frenzied fan base of \u201cMurderinos,\u201d who collectively revel in upsettingly graphic descriptions of crimes both sexual and violent like children around a campfire. For many in its \u201cFan Cult,\u201d MFM hit its stride barely four months into its run on May 27, 2016, in what remains its most troubling and entertaining episode ever, which fans voted as the podcast\u2019s best just last month.\n\nEpisode 18, \u201cInvestigateighteen Discovery,\u201d is slow to get off the ground. It was early days for Kilgariff and Hardstark, and it\u2019s a hoot to hear them struggle goofily in the first few minutes. \u201cWatch your hand on that,\u201d snaps Hardstark. Maybe \u201cwe should have mic stands?\u201d Kilgariff responds. No one even seems sure if the show is recording until about ten minutes in.\n\nAt that point, they settle comfortably into what has since become an episodic staple: fan appreciation. This is a particularly charming iteration, with Hardstark labeling the hosts of their Facebook appreciation group \u201cMurderators\u201d while Kilgariff hawks fans\u2019 Etsy pages and craft websites. Kilgariff also reveals that she\u2019s in \u201cemotional recoil from telling my period story\u201d \u2014 the story gets edited out, but this deeply personal admission helps to couch the horrific tales coming up, as if to say, \u201cRemember, this show is supposed to be fun!\u201d\n\nThree minutes later, Kilgariff opens with the story of Mary Vincent, a 15-year-old hitchhiker whose life was ruined when she met retired merchant marine Lawrence Singleton outside of Berkeley in 1978. On her way back to Las Vegas, Vincent was picked up by Singleton \u2014 a \u201cbalding,\u201d \u201cpaunchy,\u201d \u201cmid-60s\u201d (Singleton was 50 at the time) alcoholic who posed no clear threat. \u201cHe looked like a grandpa,\u201d jokes Kilgariff, which explains why Vincent fell asleep in the passenger seat.\n\nWhen she awoke in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, Vincent confronted Singleton, who responded by bludgeoning her, tying her up in a pervy van, raping her, and \u2014 \u201cit peaks in fucked-upness here\u201d \u2014 hacking her arms off with a hatchet. Vincent\u2019s bloody body, Kilgariff reports, was thrown into a Sacramento reservoir, and Singleton drove away.\n\nThose alive in 1979 or familiar with the episode of Lifetime\u2019s I Survived about Vincent may recall her fate. \u201cThis was on the news every night,\u201d Kilgariff tells Hardstark, \u201cand my parents were livid.\u201d Thankfully, the young lady did not die; she instead used her own blood to make a muddy poultice, then crawled naked onto the California freeway. At the hospital, she described Singleton to the police, who arrested him promptly. He was sentenced to the maximum of 14 years in jail, served eight, and upon parole, murdered a 31-year-old mother of three and sex worker named Roxanne Hayes.\n\nIn Kilgariff\u2019s intoxicating, feverish telling, Vincent\u2019s and Hayes\u2019s stories become opposite ends of a Coen Brothers\u2013esque seesaw, grotesque and darkly comic at various points. Had Vincent died that night, the hosts speculate, Singleton may never have needed to relocate, therefore ruining two lives instead of just one; then again, it was Vincent who brought Singleton to justice for Hayes\u2019s murder, leading to his death in prison.\n\nBoth women are quick to praise the innate female strength embodied by Singleton\u2019s victims while acknowledging the monstrous patriarchal id that tried to annihilate them. But the intense vibes permeating the room don\u2019t last long: Almost in the same breath, Hardstark giggles, \u201cAnyone who needs to use the bathroom, go use it now.\u201d\n\nShe then begins to weave the equally insane tale of Franklin Delano (\u201cROOSEVELT?!,\u201d jokes Kilgariff) Floyd, an incestuous child predator and murderer. Immediately, the hosts come for Floyd\u2019s parents. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re a murderer. It\u2019s almost like making sure your kid\u2019s a narcissist by naming him almost after a president,\u201d Hardstark says. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst name,\u201d Kilgariff adds, to which Hardstark says, \u201cLet\u2019s just call him Floyd.\u201d\n\nFloyd was 19 when he kidnapped and molested a toddler in 1962, broke out of jail, robbed a bank, and went back to prison for ten years. On parole, he attacked one woman and later married another, Sharon Marshall (revealed soon after to be his stepdaughter), who in 1990 \u201cwas found dead in a suspicious hit-and-run.\u201d\n\nThis atrocious but deliciously twisty tale is more studiously (and quickly) told, with Hardstark sounding almost professorial in her dedication to notes. Ultimately, however, the polished approach is abandoned, with both women finally snapping and declaring Floyd a \u201chuge piece of shit\u201d and the \u201cworst kind of person.\u201d When Hardstark reveals that Floyd got the death penalty, it is cathartic and almost gleeful; Kilgariff, acting as the audience surrogate, unleashes an audible hiss of pleasure.\n\nTheir stories told, the hosts deliver their signature outro in playful tandem: \u201cStay sexy, and don\u2019t get murdered.\u201d Despite its grimness, the episode concludes in a rebellious, triumphant space, with the hosts having waded into and out of perhaps the darkest waters in MFM history. Few podcasts ever get to explore those depths, but even fewer come out funny on the other side.", "description": "Highlighting the best episode of Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark\u2019s podcast \u2018My Favorite Murder,\u2019 \u201cInvestigateighteen Discovery.\u201d", "authors": ["Sean Malin"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/13/13-karen-kilgariff-georgia-hardstark.w1200.h630.jpg"}
