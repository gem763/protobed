The Philippines has been in the list\u2019s top two countries with unsolved murders of journalists since 2008 and has remained the highest since 2017.\n\nSecond in the list was Mexico, where there have been 30 unsolved killings this year. In both countries, the murders often appear related to reporting on their respective drug wars.\n\nThe country also ranked fifth on the CPJ\u2019s \u201cGlobal Impunity Index,\u201d which seeks to \u201chighlight countries where journalists are murdered and their killers go free.\u201d Somalia topped the list.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s fifth-worst ranking is due in part to the deadly ambush of 58 individuals, including 32 journalists and media workers, in Ampatuan, Maguindanao, on November 23, 2009,\u201d it stated. \u201cThe trial of over 100 suspects behind the massacre is due to conclude this year, but as of August 31, the final date CPJ counted convictions for this year\u2019s index, no verdict had been announced.\u201d\n\nThe findings underline rising concern about freedom of the press in the Philippines, a country whose democratic institutions have been strained under the leadership of their strongman leader Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nDespite launching a somewhat successful crackdown on the country\u2019s drug trade, Duterte has repeatedly clashed with the media over their reporting of alleged human rights abuses including extrajudicial executions.\n\nThis year, Maria Ressa, the co-founder of the Filipino news website Rappler, was arrested by authorities over what the government said were charges of \u201ccyber libel.\u201d She was arrested again in May on charges of violating laws barring foreign ownership of media, having just last year been named as one of a collection of journalists for Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year.\u201d\n\nHer arrests have been widely condemned as politically motivated, with the U.S. Embassy demanding that consequent legal proceedings were fully in accordance with \u201crelevant Philippine law and international standards of due process.\u201d She has since been released on bail with charges pending.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The Philippines has the highest number of unsolved murders of journalists for the third year in a row, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Maria-Ressa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
