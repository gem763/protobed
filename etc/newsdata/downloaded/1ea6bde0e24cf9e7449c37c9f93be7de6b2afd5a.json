You can have sake through the whole meal.\"\n\n\"People have a really open mind\"\n\nThe chef says he appreciates the openness of the local culinary scene -- a luxury not afforded to him in his homeland.\n\n\"I think the cuisine in Sydney is quite modern and forward-thinking because chefs have the freedom to use whatever is available, whatever is on the market,\"\n\nsays Zanellato.\n\n\"People are more than welcome here to use tomato and match it with the shiso leaves, for example. No one will say anything. You can match seafood and dairy. Whereas in the old continent in, for example, in Italy, which is very conservative, there are all those rules that to me have no meaning.\"\n\nThose restrictions, he says, limit the creativity of a chef.\n\n\"Instead, here in Sydney you have an open book, you can really do whatever you want and people have a really open mind when it comes down to food,\" explains Zanellato.\n\n\"As long as you don't make too much confusion on a dish, people are happy to try new food combinations -- and new drink pairings as well.\"\n\nTo learn more about Zanellato and his cooking check out the above video.", "description": "Chef Federico Zanellato was born in Italy and lives in Australia, but much of the cuisine served in his Sydney restaurant, LuMi, is influenced by Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190923083028-sake-sydney-pairing-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
