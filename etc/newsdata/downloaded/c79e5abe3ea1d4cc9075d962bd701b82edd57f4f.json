In a lengthy statement, the company says it will reduce the one-year suspension of player Ng \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Wai Chung to a six-month one, and it will restore the prize money it withheld from him.\n\nBlizzard claims that its initial decision was not influenced by its relationship with China. \u201cThe specific views expressed by blitzchung were not a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,\u201d writes J. Allen Brack, the president of Blizzard Entertainment. \u201cWe have these rules to keep the focus on the game and on the tournament to the benefit of a global audience, and that was the only consideration in the actions we took. If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.\u201d\n\nYet Brack also says that, after evaluating the situation and listening to the community, \u201csix months for blitzchung is more appropriate, after which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cThere is a consequence for taking the conversation away from the purpose of the event and disrupting or derailing the broadcast. With regard to the casters, remember their purpose is to keep the event focused on the tournament. That didn\u2019t happen here, and we are setting their suspension to six months as well.\u201d\n\nBrack says Blizzard will continue to enforce these rules in the future \u201cto ensure our official broadcasts remain focused on the game and are not a platform for divisive social or political views.\u201d\n\nRiot Games, the developer of popular e-sport title League of Legends and a subsidiary of Chinese gaming giant Tencent, echoed a similar sentiment earlier today when it weighed in on the controversy. Riot says broadcasters should \u201crefrain\u201d from commenting on or discussing \u201csensitive topics\u201d on air during League of Legends e-sports events.\n\n\u201cAs a general rule, we want to keep our broadcasts focused on the game, the sport, and the players,\u201d John Needham, the global head of League of Legends, e-sports said in a statement. \u201cWe serve fans from many different countries and cultures, and we believe this opportunity comes with a responsibility to keep personal views on sensitives issues (political, religious, or otherwise) separate.\u201d Fortnite creator Epic Games, in which Tencent has also invested, says it will not punish players for political speech.\n\nEpic supports the rights of Fortnite players and creators to speak about politics and human rights.https://t.co/GWxDjKVjeJ \u2014 Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) October 9, 2019\n\nIn the wake of the initial ban, Blizzard has faced immense pressure from players, politicians, and activists who criticized the developer for what\u2019s seen as its capitulation to the Chinese government. In his post-game interview, Wai Chung said, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!\u201d Blizzard operates numerous e-sports events and operates a variety of live multiplayer games in the country. Therefore, Blizzard\u2019s ban could be construed as an appeasement to the Chinese government, which is engaged in a lengthy months-long crackdown of the Hong Kong protests and has typically applied pressure on foreign businesses that do not abide by the company\u2019s political positions and stance on free speech.\n\nThe company claimed at the time that Wai Chung simply violated its tournament rules. \u201cWhile we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules,\u201d Blizzard said in its statement. The rule in question forbids players from doing anything that \u201cbrings [them] into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages [Blizzard\u2019s] image.\u201d\n\nBlizzard\u2019s ban arrived amidst a controversial moment between China and US businesses\n\nDespite Blizzard\u2019s best efforts to claim otherwise, the ban did not paint it a positive light with regard to respect for free speech and political expression. It also occurred amidst a controversial standoff between the NBA and China, which took offense to Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of the Hong Kong protestors. The NBA eventually stood by Morey, resulting in a deterioration of the league and the Rockets\u2019 relationship with the country \u2014 its biggest foreign market and a source of considerable broadcast, investor, and sponsorship support.\n\nBlizzard, which had not spoken out about its move to appease the Chinese government beyond its initial statement, has instead faced a domestic backlash. Employees have staged multiple walk outs, players have been boycotting the company and popular Blizzard games like Overwatch, and lawmakers have condemned its actions as antithetical to American values and in support of an authoritarian regime\u2019s stifling of free expression.\n\nThis hurts. But until Blizzard reverses their decision on @blitzchungHS I am giving up playing Classic WoW, which I helped make and helped convince Blizzard to relaunch. There will be no Mark of Kern guild after all.\n\n\n\nLet me explain why I am #BoycottBlizzard \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not clear Blizzard\u2019s new statement or its reduction of the suspension are going to win over many critics. Brack is clearly trying toe a very narrow line when he writes, \u201cOne of our goals at Blizzard is to make sure that every player, everywhere in the world, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, race, gender, or any other consideration always feels safe and welcome both competing in and playing our games.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to see Brack defend Blizzard\u2019s values, including \u201cEvery Voice Matters,\u201d when that clearly flies in the face of the Chinese government\u2019s position on political expression and criticism.\n\n\u201cEvery Voice Matters, and we strongly encourage everyone in our community to share their viewpoints in the many places available to express themselves,\u201d Brack writes. \u201cHowever, the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where all are welcome. In support of that, we want to keep the official channels focused on the game.\u201d In this case, the voice that matters most is China\u2019s, even if it doesn\u2019t have to formally speak up to get Blizzard to act accordingly.", "description": "Video game developer Blizzard Entertainment has finally broken its silence over banning a professional player of popular virtual card game Hearthstone for voicing support for the Hong Kong protests.
