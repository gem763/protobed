Earlier this month, however, Other Press published the English translation of his memoir, \u201cI Will Never See the World Again,\u201d which was written behind bars, defiantly, and smuggled out to that world he will never see.\n\nI feel a special sort of empathy with Mr. Altan because I too am facing a life sentence \u2014 a terminal disease in the form of an often fatal form of brain tumor \u2014 but in my case at least I can blame health, God or bad fortune rather than my own vindictive countrymen.\n\nHere it must be said that the title of Mr. Altan\u2019s book is the statement of a brutal fact, rather than a cry of despair. There is not a smidgen of self-pity in the memoir\u2019s 212 pages. What emerges is this: You cannot jail my mind, and you cannot shut me up. \u201cI have never woken up in prison, not once,\u201d he writes. \u201cI am writing this in a prison cell and I am not in prison. I am a writer.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Altan, who at 69 is in his third year in prison, defies the degradations of prison life, he also doesn\u2019t minimize them. He writes about \u201cthe fires of terror,\u201d as he calls them; the pernicious process of dis-individuation; the substitution of his normally unused birth certificate name for the one he is usually known by; and the replacement of his clothing for a uniform. He cannot dress or undress, eat, bathe or exercise when he pleases. But one of the harshest privations is a surprising one: There are no mirrors or even reflective surfaces anywhere in his prison campus, which houses an astonishing 11,000 prisoners, most of them there for political reasons.", "description": "Ahmet Altan, author of the new book \u201cI Will Never See the World Again,\u201d has been imprisoned for life. I\u2019m being treated for a brain tumor. We\u2019re both determined to keep going.", "authors": ["Rod Nordland"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/books/24ALTAN1/24ATLAN1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
