Hopefully we can avoid taking any penalties for tomorrow. It\u2019s annoying because looking at the times, I think I had a chance at qualifying third.\u201d\n\nBottas was checked out at the circuit medical centre after the crash with his team going on to post on Twitter: \u201cHe\u2019s OK! Valtteri Bottas has returned to the paddock. Great news.\u201d\n\nBottas qualified in sixth, two places behind Hamilton for Sunday\u2019s race, but could be hit by car problems following his crash at the high-speed Peraltada curve.\n\n\u201cThankfully he\u2019s ok,\u201d said Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff. \u201cBut unfortunately his car took a bit of a beating.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re assessing the damage at the moment and hope that we don\u2019t have to change any parts that would result in a grid penalty. Lewis will start from P4 which is not ideal, but tomorrow will be all about tyre life, so this might create some opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nHamilton needs to outscore Bottas by 14 points to seal his sixth title success.\n\nHamilton said he would \u201cgive it everything\u201d in his scrap for a podium finish and hoped to enjoy a close battle with pole sitter Max Verstappen of Red Bull and the two Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel.\n\nVerstappen\u2019s performance in the final minutes of qualifying when he clocked an improved lap time on his second run was under scrutiny after the session as he ignored a waved yellow flag following Bottas\u2019s crash.\n\nThe Dutchman, who could have faced a penalty if he was the subject of a stewards\u2019 inquiry, said he did not care if the stewards deleted his lap time as his earlier fastest lap was still enough for him to claim pole.\n\nAsked if he had obeyed the rules when he saw the yellow flag and reduced speed, he said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like it, did it?\u201d", "description": "Mexico City (AFP) \u2013 Championship challenger Valtteri Bottas admitted he \u201chad to risk it\u201d when he buried his Mercedes into a trackside", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/bcf70f_bottas-leaving-circuit-his-crash-had-risk-it-bottas-mexico-horror-crash-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
