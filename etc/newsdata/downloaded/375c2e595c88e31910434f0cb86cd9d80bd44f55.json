Eric Swalwell (D-CA) announced Monday that he will bring his long-shot campaign to an end.\n\n\u201cToday ends our presidential campaign, but it is the beginning of an opportunity in Congress, with a new perspective shaped by the lives that have touched mine and our campaign throughout these last three months, to bring that promise of America to all Americans,\u201d he said at a press conference at his campaign headquarters. Swalwell acknowledged that he wasn\u2019t as viable as some of his opponents, adding that he only raised about $850,000 this past quarter.\n\nSwalwell, the 38-year-old member of the House Intelligence Committee, focused his presidential bid on confronting gun violence but failed to gain any traction. He languished at the bottom of the pack in polling and\u2014prior to dropping out\u2014ran the risk of missing out on qualifying for the next debate.\n\nPrior to his Monday announcement, Swalwell scrapped a planned trip to New Hampshire last week\u2014a signal that things were not going as planned.\n\nThe congressman attempted to steal the spotlight during the first presidential debate in Miami late last month by saying that former Vice President Joe Biden \u201cwas right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago; he is still right today.\u201d\n\nBiden quickly dispatched him with a quip that he was \u201cstill holding on to that torch.\u201d\n\nIn February, the California Democrat said he would give up his seat to run for president but more recently he had told The Washington Post that he would think about running for re-election if he missed out on future debates with higher prerequisites for qualification.\n\nSwalwell now faces the prospect of a primary challenger in California\u2019s 15th congressional district from city councilor Aisha Wahab, a 31-year-old progressive who was the first Afghan-American elected to office in the country. She announced her intention to run when the expectation was that Swalwell would not seek re-election. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to reassess it,\u201d she told the Post in June about the prospect of the incumbent returning to defend his seat.\n\nThough he is the first candidate from the debates to exit, Swalwell is not the first candidate overall to cut the cord this cycle, nor will he be the last. In January, former West Virginia State Senator Richard Ojeda abandoned his short-lived bid.\n\nAnother California Democrat could quickly take Swalwell\u2019s place in the 2020 field, however. Multiple reports indicated on Sunday that liberal billionaire activist Tom Steyer was set to enter the presidential race possibly as soon as Tuesday. In January, he went to Iowa seemingly to announce his candidacy but called it off in favor of his impeachment efforts.\n\nWhile there has been chatter from a number of sources that Steyer has had a change of heart since then, Heather Hargreaves, the executive director of his organization NextGen America told The Daily Beast \u201cI have no comment at this time\u201d when asked about his plans on Monday.", "description": "The first candidate to find the exit door since the 2020 cycle began in earnest.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1562616732/190708-resnick-stalwell-tease_csmrwd", "published_at": "2019-07-08"}
