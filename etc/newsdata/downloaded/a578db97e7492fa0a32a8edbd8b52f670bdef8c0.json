But unfortunately, this is no longer true of some Democratic presidential candidates and other Democratic elected officials.\n\nThis represents a disturbing shift from the Democratic Party of decades past, when support for Israel and opposition to anti-Semitism were pillars of the party.\n\nEvery Democratic president from Truman through Bill Clinton stood firmly with Israel \u2013 not agreeing with Israeli leaders on everything, but understanding that Israel is an invaluable ally that benefits the U.S. in many ways and an outpost of democracy in the unstable Middle East.\n\nPALESTINIAN SCHOOL CURRICULUM IS 'MORE RADICAL THAN THE CURRICULUM THAT CAME BEFORE,' RESEARCH INSTITUTE SAYS\n\nSadly, in recent years more and more Democrats have taken to demonizing anyone who supports the Jewish state \u2013 even going as far as to falsely label them as Islamophobic.\n\nSo what say those who want to be our next president? We already have some clues.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \u2013 the only Jewish American among the leading presidential candidates \u2013 has been the most hostile towards Israel. He has referred to the Israeli government as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201coppressive\u201d and has advocated cutting U.S. military support.\n\nSanders recently tapped Linda Sarsour, a rabid anti-Semite, to join his campaign. He then proceeded to speak at an Islamic Society of North America conference that promoted Islamic law, admonishing Muslims to wage jihad against the Jews.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., hired a director for progressive partnerships who openly supports Hamas, a militant terrorist group that seeks Israel\u2019s destruction and has launched rockets and terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians from its base of operations in the Gaza Strip.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas bluntly called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a \u201cracist.\u201d This is a shameful act of hostility towards the democratically elected leader of a close American ally.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \u2013 the only Jewish American among the leading presidential candidates \u2013 has been the most hostile towards Israel\n\nWe know less about where the other major Democratic presidential candidates stand. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey have avoided direct confrontation and continue to present a moderate approach to U.S.-Israeli relations.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden stood and watched as the relationship between President Barack Obama and Netanyahu grew increasingly strained. Biden has said Netanyahu is taking Israel in the \u201cwrong direction\u201d and reportedly strong-armed Ukraine into voting against Israel at the United Nations in the waning days of the Obama administration.\n\nVoters like me, who have supported candidates on both sides of the aisle, need to know that whoever serves as president of the United States will not only speak up for Israel, but also actively fight against anti-Jewish bigotry.\n\nMeanwhile, some other Democratic elected officials have taken to spreading anti-Semitic tropes, accusing Jews of dual loyalty and suggesting that Jewish money makes the world go round.\n\nShamefully, Democrats in Congress could not even come together to pass a resolution unequivocally singling out and condemning anti-Semitism. Instead, they passed a watered-down resolution broadly condemning all types of prejudice.\n\nThen there\u2019s the unlawful and anti-Semitic push to boycott Israeli people and businesses, known as the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS). By cutting off Israel from the world, BDS seeks the economic strangulation of the world\u2019s only Jewish state.\n\nThe hate-filled BDS campaign has crept from fringe political circles to the mainstream of the Democratic Party. Sixteen Democratic House members recently voted against legislation condemning BDS, including celebrity freshmen Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\nWhen she was a candidate for the House seat she now holds, Omar told Jewish voters in her district that she thought BDS was counterproductive to peace efforts. Candidate Tlaib said she supported a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both completely reversed their positions after winning their respective elections.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThroughout history, rising anti-Semitism has always been accompanied by other forms of radicalization and the degradation of democracy overall.\n\nWill Democrats continue to creep closer to radical anti-Israel and even anti-Semitic policy positions? Will they undermine the party\u2019s traditional values of tolerance and equality? If so, they risk consigning themselves to the tragic fate of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s British Labour Party, which has allowed a culture of anti-Semitism to take root and poison the entire institution.\n\nIn an all-too-familiar routine, far too many Democrats pander to the Jewish community on pro-Israel issues when running for office and then turn around and show their true colors after Election Day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTo date, the candidates running for president have skated by \u2013 banking on the fact that no one is asking them about a subject they\u2019d rather ignore.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the media to ask these questions and get real answers. Voters like me will be watching closely.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY BROOKE GOLDSTEIN", "description": "Some Democratic presidential candidates and other Democratic elected officials have broken from the party's long history of supporting Israel and fighting anti-Semitism.", "authors": ["Brooke Goldstein", "Brooke Goldstein Is A Human Rights Attorney", "Author", "Filmmaker.
