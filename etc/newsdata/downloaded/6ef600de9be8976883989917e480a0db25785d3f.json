That was one of three touchdown drives of 75-plus yards for the Vikings (2-1), each of which was aided by Raiders penalties. Cornerback Gareon Conley was flagged for holding during a third-and-9 incompletion by Cousins, extending the opening possession.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing a team like Minnesota, you just can\u2019t give them second life,\u201d Raiders coach Jon Gruden said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nNext week, the Raiders (1-2) play at Indianapolis. Then they travel to London to face Chicago, counting as one of their home games. After their bye week, they go back on the road two more times to take on Green Bay and Houston, before finally returning to the Oakland Coliseum on Nov. 3 to host Detroit. At this rate, the Raiders could be well on their way to another top-five overall draft pick. They\u2019ve already endured the Antonio Brown sideshow that led to his release and had first-round draft pick Johnathan Abram suffer a season-ending shoulder injury in the opener.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a lot of bonding time, right? We\u2019re going to be together as a team,\u201d Carr said, dismissing the perceived unfairness of their schedule. \u201cNo one cares. We\u2019ve just got to win games, right?\u201d\n\nCarr threw an interception that set up a Vikings touchdown and was sacked four times for 28 yards, under frequent pressure by a Vikings defensive line that\u2019s one of the most dangerous in the NFL.\n\nLeft guard Richie Incognito returned from suspension to make his Raiders debut, but right guard Gabe Jackson remained out with a knee injury. In the fourth quarter, right tackle Trent Brown limped off the field, after missing time in practice this week to a knee injury. Left tackle Kolton Miller had plenty of trouble blocking defensive end Everson Griffen.\n\nEven when the Raiders frequently used maximum protection schemes, facing so many pass-likely scenarios after falling behind 21-0 early in the second quarter, they still had trouble keeping Minnesota\u2019s front four away from Carr.\n\n\u201cYou get down like that against that team, it\u2019s going to be hard to fight back,\u201d Carr said.\n\nCarr went 27 for 34 for 242 yards and touchdowns to J.J. Nelson and Tyrell Williams. The bright spot, clearly, was tight end Darren Waller, who racked up 13 receptions for 134 yards, even if that came mostly in garbage time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not getting any easier for us, but I don\u2019t think guys in this locker room are looking for easy,\u201d Waller said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to take that road that\u2019s going to be as tough as possible, because that will bring the best out of us. It will bring the worst out of us at times, but in the end it will flush that all out and bring the best out of us because we\u2019re really being put to the test. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For a team already on the way out of Oakland, set to move to Las Vegas next year, hitting the road for such a long stretch will hardly be the biggest challenge to face the Raiders in a season already filled with setbacks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/raiders_vikings_football_26265_c0-186-4450-2780_s1770x1032.jpg?810fbceffb5af75813aa6a0a0f012f89c1595957", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
