After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\nRebekah has denied the allegations (Photo by Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nRebekah, 37, has denied the allegations, and confirmed that she is launching a forensic investigation to prove she was not behind the fake stories.\n\nHowever, the drama has got even more\u2026 well, dramatic, as Danielle Lloyd has entered the feud.\n\nThe reality star, who previously dated Teddy Sheringham and was married to Jamie O\u2019Hara, said on Good Morning Britain: \u2018I wasn\u2019t as shocked. Because I\u2019ve had run-ins with Rebekah before over similar things, so I wasn\u2019t as shocked.\n\n\u2018Obviously like everybody else you read it and you think, \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d but I wasn\u2019t as shocked seeing who it actually allegedly was.\u2019\n\nAnd Rebekah broke her silence to lash out at the 35-year-old, tweeting: \u2018Danielle Lloyd making false claims on @thismorning that we have had \u2018similar run-ins\u2019 is utter b*****ks. She is just fuming that I \u2018didn\u2019t get Jamie recruiting\u2019 for her like she asked me to\u2026\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has been claimed that if Becky does prove that she was not behind the leaks, she could even sue Coleen.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
