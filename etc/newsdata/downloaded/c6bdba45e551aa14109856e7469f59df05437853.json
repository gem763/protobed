Tequila parties and spiritual seminars are out. Balanced budgets and profitability are back.\n\nThe most recent evidence of shifting investor sentiment? Peloton\u2019s disappointing market debut today (Sept. 26). The exercise-bike company seemed to cramp up during its big moment.\n\nAfter pricing its class A shares at $29 each, Peloton slipped when public trading began. By mid-day, the stock was down 10%, with shares trading near $26. In afternoon trading, the decline continued. At the time of writing, shares were trading at $25, off 14% from their IPO price.\n\nPeloton, which brands itself as a high-end exercise company, sells stationary bikes (starting from $2,245), treadmills ($4,295), and subscriptions to live-streaming workout classes ($39 per month). Despite the exorbitant prices, though, the company is rapidly losing money.\n\nIn IPO filings, the company reported a loss of $245.7 million during fiscal year 2019, the largest in its history. And while Peloton managed an $8 billion valuation\u2014at least briefly\u2014on the public markets, the company faces a tough road ahead.\n\nPeloton confronts an outstanding lawsuit from music publishers for allegedly using unlicensed songs in its workout videos. Like Uber and Lyft, it also relies on independent contractors, using them to deliver and install its equipment. Peloton\u2019s other risk factors include rent for its production studios, cloud computing costs (for live streaming), and subscriber retention.\n\n\u201cMy estimate is about $18 to $19 [per share] and that\u2019s giving [Peloton] the benefit of every doubt,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University\u2019s business school, on CNBC Thursday. \u201cYou have, fundamentally, a good business model. I just don\u2019t think it can scale up enough to justify the market cap.\u201d\n\nThe professor also added that Peloton\u2019s market cap doesn\u2019t reflect the company\u2019s approximately 66 million options, which it could exercise to purchase nearly $2 billion worth of additional shares below market value.\n\nBut while investor sentiment has broadly turned against IPOing unicorns, it\u2019s hardly given pause to venture capitalists, who continue to unload unprofitable equity. Even at $25-26 per share, investors in Peloton\u2019s latest financing round would almost double their money.\n\nUltimately, \u201chappiness\u201d continues to sell. But it\u2019s probably overpriced.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\u2019s most important and interesting news.\n\nMore stories from Quartz:", "description": "On its first day of trading, the high-end exercise company's stock dropped 8% from its $29 IPO price.", "authors": ["Matthew De Silva"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QQivBMZQYPN0Ue_MWn2YZA--~B/aD01NzU7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/269461c492bd53848c2d577df099bffe", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
