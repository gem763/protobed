Scary.", "language": "en", "text": "You might remember the 21st night of September, but do you remember when the full moon arrives this month? Saturday Night Live\u2019s werewolf choreographer Tony Shalis sure doesn\u2019t, which is why he keeps interrupting his class to scream and fumble with the blinds. Chance the Rapper stars as a dedicated hopeful willing to lose it all at a chance for back-up dancer success, but he\u2019s absolutely not willing to stop giggling for two second, all while Kenan Thompson acquires more and more hair. Even more terrifying, Earth, Wine & Fire are apparently holding rehearsals for their Halloween Boogie Spectacular\u2026on Halloween night! Good thing the real Chance doesn\u2019t have to decided between fame and letting a werewolf throw his wife through the wall of a dance studio. He\u2019d never hit the big time.", "description": "Chance the Rapper stars in Saturday Night Live\u2019s werewolf choreographer sketch alongside Kenan Thompson as the titular werewolf.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/27-SNL-Werewolf-Chance.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
