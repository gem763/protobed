The gunman has been identified as a white male in his 30s, but police have not released a name or possible motive.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA news conference was scheduled for later Sunday in Odessa.\n\nThe shooting began Saturday afternoon with an interstate traffic stop where gunfire was exchanged with police, setting off a chaotic rampage during which the suspect hijacked a mail carrier truck and fired at random as he drove in the area of Odessa and Midland, two cities in the heart of Texas oil country more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) west of Dallas.\n\nPolice initially reported possible multiple shooters, but Odessa police Chief Michael Gerke later said there was only one male suspect.\n\nThe suspect shot \u201cat innocent civilians all over Odessa,\u201d according to a statement from Odessa police, which did not name the man or offer motive.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Before the vehicle came to a complete stop, the driver \u201cpointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots\u201d toward the patrol car stopping him. The gunshots struck one of two troopers inside the patrol car, Cesinger said, after which the gunman fled and continued shooting. Two other police officers were shot before the suspect was killed. The condition of the three law enforcement officers injured was not immediately released.\n\nGerke said there were at least 21 civilian shooting victims.\n\nShauna Saxton was one of the terrified drivers who said she encountered the gunman during his rampage, during which multiple witnesses described gunfire near shopping plazas and in busy intersections. Saxton was driving with her husband and grandson in Odessa and had paused at a stoplight when they heard loud pops.\n\n\u201cI looked over my shoulder to the left and the gold car pulled up and the man was there and he had a very large gun and it was pointing at me,\u201d she told TV station KOSA.\n\nSaxton said she was trapped because there were two cars in front of her. \u201cI started honking my horn. I started swerving and we got a little ahead of him and then for whatever reason the cars in front of me kind of parted,\u201d she said sobbing. She said she heard three more shots as she sped away.\n\nGerke did not go into detail about the chase, but the movie theater where the suspect was killed is more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) from where state troopers originally pulled over the gunman.\n\nThe shooting comes just four weeks after a gunman in the Texas border city of El Paso killed 22 people after opening fire at a Walmart. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this week held two meetings with lawmakers about how to prevent more mass shootings in Texas. He said he would visit the area Sunday.\n\nThe shooting Saturday brings the number of mass killings in the U.S. so far this year to 25, matching the number in all of 2018, according to The AP/USATODAY/Northeastern University mass murder database. The number of victims for this year has already reached 142, surpassing all last year.\n\nSeven people had remained in critical condition at one hospital hours after the West Texas shooting, said Russell Tippin, CEO of Medical Center Hospital in Odessa. He said a child under 2 years old was transported to another hospital.\n\nDustin Fawcett said he was sitting in his truck at a Starbucks in Odessa when he heard at least six gunshots ring out less than 50 yards (46 meters) behind him.\n\nHe spotted a white sedan with a passenger window that had been shattered. That\u2019s when he thought, \u201cOh man, this is a shooting.\u201d\n\nOdessa and Midland police and sheriff's deputies surround an area in Odessa, Texas, after reports of shootings on Saturday. | Tim Fischer/Midland Reporter-Telegram via AP\n\nFawcett, 28, an Odessa transportation consultant, \u201cgot out to make sure everyone was safe\u201d but found that no one had been struck by the gunfire nearby. He said a little girl was bleeding, but she hadn\u2019t been shot, and that he later found out she was grazed in the face.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said following the shooting that President Donald Trump and his administration \u201cremain absolutely determined\u201d to work with leaders in both parties in Congress to take such steps \u201cso we can address and confront this scourge of mass atrocities in our country.\u201d\n\nPence said Trump had spoken to the attorney general and that the FBI was assisting local law enforcement.\n\nTrump has offered contradictory messages in reacting to recent mass shootings. Days after the El Paso shooting he said he was eager to implement \u201cvery meaningful background checks\u201d on guns and told reporters there was \u201ctremendous support\u201d for action. He later backed away, saying the current system of background checks was \u201cvery, very strong.\u201d\n\nMost recently, Trump has called for greater attention to mental health, saying that new facilities are needed for the mentally ill as a way to reduce mass shootings. However, some mental health professionals say such thinking is outdated, that linking mental illness to violence is wrong, and that the impact of more treatment would be helpful overall but would have a minor impact on gun violence.\n\n", "description": "The gunman has been identified as a white male in his 30s, but police have not released a name or possible motive.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a1/3c/16be5f6940939e1563fb138e653d/20190901-police-chief-texas-shooting-ap-773.jpg"}
