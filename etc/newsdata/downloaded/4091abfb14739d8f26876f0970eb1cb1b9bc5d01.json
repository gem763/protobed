Andrew Milligan/Pool via REUTERS\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson is nothing like Winston Churchill but someone who tells lies about the European Union, according to the grandson of Britain\u2019s wartime leader who was sacked from the Conservative Party this week.\n\nNicholas Soames, 71, the son of Mary Soames, the youngest of Churchill\u2019s five children, was expelled from Johnson\u2019s party after defying party orders over Brexit.\n\nIn an interview with the Times newspaper published on its website on Friday, Soames said Johnson, who wrote a biography of his hero Churchill, was not comparable to his celebrated grandfather.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson is nothing like Winston Churchill. I don\u2019t think anyone has called Boris a diplomat or statesman,\u201d said Soames, who has been a Member of Parliament (MP) since 1983.\n\n\u201cWinston Churchill was like Winston Churchill because of his experiences in life. Boris Johnson\u2019s experience in life is telling a lot of porkies (lies) about the European Union in Brussels and then becoming prime minister.\u201d\n\nSoames said he had shed tears after being one of 21 rebel Conservatives ousted from the party, having already announced he would not stand for parliament again at the next election.\n\nHe said Johnson had a \u201ccunning plan\u201d to get an election and was deliberately manipulating politicians, knowing he would not be able to strike a new withdrawal deal with the EU. He said the prime minister was \u201csigned up to the Trump playbook \u2014 it\u2019s \u2018shock and awe\u2019 until it all becomes normal\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe is engaged on this great Brexit obsession: get us out, deal or no deal, do or die,\u201d Soames told the paper.\n\n\u201cThat is not Winston Churchill. I think Churchill would have thought it extraordinary that we would have thought ourselves so successful, so powerful, so well thought of in the world that we could afford to give up this extraordinary relationship we have in this great European Union.\u201d", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is nothing like Winston Churchill but someone who tells lies about the European Union, according to the grandson of Britain's wartime leader who was sacked from the Conservative Party this week.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427008735&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851PO", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
