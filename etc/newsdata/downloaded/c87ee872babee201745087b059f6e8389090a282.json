That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do.\u201d\n\nHe said successes in the 12 trial areas could be quickly rolled out to other branches.\n\nMr Rowse continued: \u201cWe believe in the future that branches will be a lot more about education \u2013 about helping people with those things that are the most important in their life \u2013 whether it\u2019s: \u2018I\u2019m opening my first account\u2019 or: \u2018I\u2019m going off to university\u2019\u2026 or: \u2018I\u2019m starting a business\u2019\u2026\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really working with the local community to find out what it is that they want.\u201d\n\nBarclays said \u201cpop-up\u201d banking facilities to help communities will also appear at 300 locations by the end of 2021.\n\nBank branch and ATM closures generally have sparked fears about people\u2019s ability to continue to access cash.\n\nThe Post Office, which has around 11,500 branches, offers banking services on behalf of many banks, but some commentators in the access-to-cash debate have argued that this should not be seen as a direct replacement for banks\u2019 own branches.\n\nSome other banks and building societies have also recently announced initiatives to boost access to cash or keep branches open.\n\nIn March, Nationwide Building Society pledged that every town and city with a branch will still have one in May 2021.\n\nIn February, Lloyds Banking Group, in partnership with Visa, announced a pilot scheme to boost the number of retailers offering cashback.\n\nHere are the 12 pilot areas where Barclays is looking at how customer demand in branches could be increased:\n\nYarm, Pickering and Guiseley in Yorkshire, Barnard Castle in County Durham, Wombourne and Kidsgrove in Staffordshire, Risca and Tredegar in South Wales, Shenfield and Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, Esher in Surrey and Biggin Hill in London.", "description": "The bank will also launch a new cashback scheme - but said a facility allowing customers to withdraw cash over the counter at Post Offices will end.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/02/wire-19421734-1570499317-325_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
