The very model of the big banks is no longer sustainable.\n\nElliott argues the economics that have propped up the all-things-to-all-people model of mass-market banking are cracking. The strategy of simply winning market share and relying on a big balance sheet to generate returns won't work in an environment of lower bank earninngs.\n\n\u201cDespite what you read in the papers, bank profitability has been under threat,\u201d Elliott said.\n\n\u201cReturn on equity has halved over the past 15 years. NIMs [net interest margins] have halved over that period. We are now much closer to our cost of equity.\n\n\u201cThe ability to hold the machine together as it is \u2026 I have a more aggressive view that that is unsustainable.\n\n\u201cI think the idea of, you know, that \u2026 these universal, mass-market banks are going to continue to thrive, I don\u2019t agree that that\u2019s the case. I am not saying there\u2019s going to be none, but I don\u2019t believe that this is sustainable in the future.\u201d\n\nIs part of this a response to claims from Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Frydenberg of profiteering? Without question. As he did earlier this week, Elliott was also determined to make the point that competition in the sector is intense. He argued that with a 15 per cent market share, ANZ itself needs to act as a disruptor if it wants a bigger chunk of the remaining 85 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Elliott is right that the big bank model is under threat, there are big implications for investors, customers and the economy.\n\nDo we end up with a bunch of smaller banks, operating in specific niches, perhaps in addition to a group of emerging fintechs entering the system? Perhaps, but as Elliott warns, these players will find it even harder to balance capital requirements and lower returns with the need for scale.\n\nThere\u2019s also a key question about what a greater number of smaller banks do to stability in the system.\n\n\u201cWe need a well-run, safe banking system in Australia,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThere is no evidence that small banks, and lots of small banks, enhance the soundness of the system.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of how today\u2019s big banks morph, and what this means for the economy.\n\nElliott said what ANZ is trying \u201cto figure out is our sources of competitive advantage along the chain\u201d. The model of building a big balance sheet, gaining market share and providing a bunch of what he called free services \u2013 branches and digital banking, for example \u2013 was getting harder.\n\n\u201cTherefore it means quite significant change in terms of what we own, how we go to market, who we go to market for \u2013 the sort of customers we\u2019re going to have.\u201d\n\nThis is a fascinating idea, particularly in the context of the political pressure being heaped on banks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClearly, ANZ has already made lots of decisions in recent years about what customers it doesn\u2019t want \u2013 customers in many of its Asian retail businesses, for example, and customers in its wealth division, which on Thursday moved a step closer to being sold to IOOF.\n\nBut the idea that falling returns and disruption will force the big four to go further in the way it picks and chooses customers has bigger implications.\n\nCould our big banks start turning low-value customers away? Elliott pointed out that open banking and comprehensive credit reporting will mean a shift towards risk-based pricing for individuals, and away from the one-sized-fits-all model, which raises ethical questions about how access to finance.\n\nThe implication is that there are some customers that banks will no longer see as attractive \u2013 particularly in a world where their returns are constrained.\n\nGetting the industry, regulators and policymakers to think these big questions feels both vital and, in the current politically charged climate, next door to impossible.", "description": "ANZ boss Shayne Elliott says falling profitability and returns mean the big bank model of being all things to all people is cracking.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7957%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_154/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c745e2614a91fad074ecbe54085fb0ae5d0a280e", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
