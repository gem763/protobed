But fish is also polluted with mercury, something none of us needs, especially an individual with ADD. Limiting fish to no more than twice a week, however, is one way to reap the rewards without overloading your system with toxic heavy metals. These teriyaki salmon kebabs combine the benefits of fish with colorful veggies (organic, if possible). Serve with a side dish of brown rice pilaf and a salad of leafy greens.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1/2 pound fillet of fresh, wild-caught salmon\n\n2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce\n\n2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil\n\n1 tablespoon raw organic honey\n\n2 cloves of garlic, crushed\n\n1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger root\n\n1 sweet onion, peeled and cut into wedges\n\n1 red pepper, seeded and cut into 1\u2033 to 2\u2033 chunks\n\n1 cup broccoli florets\n\n4 cherry tomatoes\n\n4 wooden skewers\n\nDirections:\n\nSoak wooden skewers in water while salmon marinates. To make the marinade, mix soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, garlic, and ginger root in a medium bowl. Cut salmon into 1\u2033 chunks, and put in bowl with marinade, spooning the liquid over the fish to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 10 to 20 minutes. Remove wooden skewers from water and coat with olive oil. Place one salmon chunk on a skewer, followed by an onion wedge, a piece of red pepper, and a broccoli floret. Continue to load the skewers until fish and vegetables are in place, and then top off each skewer with a cherry tomato on one end. Put the skewers on a baking dish, drizzle with leftover marinade, and place under the broiler. Turn skewers every minute or so, using up leftover marinade, until salmon is thoroughly cooked, which should take about 4 to 5 minutes. (When small white bubbles appear on the outside of the salmon, it should be fairly well cooked.) Remove skewers from broiler and allow to sit for 1 or 2 minutes while the fish completes cooking.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nNutritional information per serving: 232 calories, 12 g fat (2 g saturated), 15 g carbohydrates, 3 g fiber, 18 g protein, 40 mg cholesterol, 351 mg sodium, 10 g sugar\n\nNote: Nutritional values are estimates only and may vary according to freshness of ingredients, methods of preparation, and other factors.\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
