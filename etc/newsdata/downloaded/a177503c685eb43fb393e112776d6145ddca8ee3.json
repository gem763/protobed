I encourage every Californian to download this app and ensure your family is earthquake ready.\u201d\n\nThe cellphone app called MyShake can provide potentially life-saving seconds of warning before the ground starts to shake from a nearby quake \u2014 enough time to drop, cover and hold on to help prevent injury, Newsom\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWarnings delivered through the system are based on a computerized program called ShakeAlert operated by the US Geological Survey that analyzes data from seismic networks in California, calculates preliminary magnitudes, and then estimates which areas will feel shaking,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe new app was put to the test this week before its official launch when two earthquakes struck in the San Francisco area and central California, measuring 4.5 and 4.7 respectively.\n\nResidents who had the app were alerted within an average of 2.1 seconds in the first case and 1.6 seconds in the latter.\n\nNewsom said that the system was not perfect but would improve over time.\n\nOfficials warned that in rare circumstances, residents may receive a ShakeAlert when there is no quake taking place.\n\nSeismologists say that California is long overdue for a huge earthquake, dubbed the Big One, as the state straddles one of the country\u2019s most dangerous fault lines \u2014 the San Andreas fault.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 California on Thursday launched the country\u2019s first earthquake warning system in the hope that residents will be alerted", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/498a52_bridge-crosses-san-andreas-fault-pacific-north-american-tectonic-plates-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
