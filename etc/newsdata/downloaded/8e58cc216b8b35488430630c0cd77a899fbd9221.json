REUTERS/Russell Boyce/File Photo\n\nThe decision to exit four European markets comes a few months after the company announced CEO David Wild would retire, in the midst of a row with disgruntled franchisees in the UK and Ireland over commercial terms.\n\nThe British company - which is itself a franchise of U.S.-based Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc (DPZ.N) - owns Domino\u2019s operations in Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and owns a minority stake in its German operations.\n\n\u201cWe have concluded that, whilst they represent attractive markets, we are not the best owners of these businesses,\u201d outgoing CEO Wild said.\n\nShares in Domino\u2019s rose 4.2% higher to 276.9 pence.\n\nDomino\u2019s businesses in the four countries will continue as normal during the exit process, the company said in a separate statement.\n\n\u201cWe have begun a process to identify new owners for each of the businesses, with the intention of the Domino\u2019s brand continuing in all four,\u201d the company said.\n\nAnalysts said the move would allow Domino\u2019s to focus on its core British and Irish businesses and clear the deck for a new CEO to boost growth in those markets.\n\n\u201cDomino\u2019s is now pulling the plug on its international operations after admitting defeat,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cThis is the sensible thing to do. Management should be applauded for making the decision to pull out rather than digging themselves a bigger hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cCOMPLEX SITUATION\u201d\n\nDomino\u2019s has struggled to control costs in its overseas business, especially in Norway, where it was converting the local pizza operator Dolly Dimple\u2019s stores it bought in 2017.\n\nWith 57 stores in Norway, the company set a turnaround plan in the country during the quarter but early signs from the plan were mixed and improvement in sales were weaker than expected, the company said.\n\nAdding to the company\u2019s woes, Europe\u2019s economy has slowed this year as the U.S.-China trade tensions weakened global growth, and consumers and businesses in and around the United Kingdom worried about the impact of Brexit on jobs and incomes.\n\n\u201cAlthough the impasse with the UK franchisees is ongoing, the decision to exit the loss-making international markets in an orderly manner releases one of the constraints on the share price,\u201d Peel Hunt analysts said.\n\nThe company said third-quarter group system sales rose 3.4% to 313.5 million pounds ($400.15 million) on strong demand in the UK and Ireland. However, international system sales fell 2.7%. It also warned of a decline in tourist numbers in Iceland.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A call out mechanic fixes a Dominos delivery scooter in the Clapham district of London, Britain June 8, 2018.
