It will mean a lot for us to go all the way as a team.\n\n\"In 2007, I was a kid watching the World Cup final in a tavern because I didn't have a TV at home. I know what it did for us back then. I have never seen people come together over sport (like that).\"\n\nKolisi had received a phone call from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on the eve on the semi-final.\n\n\"It was really special for him to take time out and wish us luck. Not only from him, but all the people in South Africa. It is really special to see how they have bought into what we are doing here,\" he said.\n\n\"The match was a semi-final, and Wales are giving their best and we are giving our best.\n\n\"You will make mistakes, but one thing I enjoy about the coach is that he lets us know that we will make mistakes, but just to keep working as hard as we can.\"\n\nKick-off for Saturday's final is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Springbok captain Siya Kolisi has paid tribute to coach Rassie Erasmus after his side secured their place in the 2019 World Cup final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4402/75f332e57f714858bb972f5b9089a3f3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
