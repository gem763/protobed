The figures provided to the House Oversight Committee suggest the vast majority of stays have occurred since Trump took office, raising concerns among Democrats about a conflict of interest.\n\nPOLITICO first reported earlier this month that the Oversight Committee had been probing military spending at Turnberry since April to determine whether the money constituted a violation of the Constitution\u2019s domestic emoluments clause, which prohibits the president from receiving any compensation from the federal government other than his salary.\n\nAfter being elected, Trump chose not to fully divest himself from his business interests, choosing instead to put his holdings in a trust that he can receive money from at any time.\n\nThe committee\u2019s probe has ramped up in the wake of POLITICO\u2019s reporting on several overnight stays at the resort by U.S. Air Force crews, some of which have been multinight stays involving dozens of crew members and passengers.\n\nThe Pentagon documents showed that U.S. taxpayer funds \u201chave been used to pay for more than three dozen separate stays involving hundreds of nights of rooms \u2014 all after the President was sworn into office,\u201d according to a letter the committee\u2019s chairman, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) wrote to acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday.\n\nMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

The airport signed a refueling contract with the Defense Department in August 2016, but in June the government announced its intent to sell the airport, which is about 30 miles away from Turnberry.\n\nIn their letter to Esper on Wednesday, Cummings and Raskin wrote that according to documents provided by the Pentagon, expenditures at the airport from the day Trump was inaugurated through June 21, 2019 amounted to nearly $17 million. But while the department claimed to pay $3.38 per gallon for fuel, the congressmen wrote, \u201cit did not provide any information on contemporaneous fuel rates at non-commercial sites, such as military bases elsewhere in Europe.\u201d\n\nAir Force Brig. Gen. Ed Thomas, the chief spokesman, told POLITICO in a statement earlier this month that \u201cinitial reviews indicate that aircrew transiting through Scotland adhered to all guidance and procedures.\u201d\n\nBut he acknowledged that U.S. service members \u201clodging at higher-end accommodations, even if within government rates, might be allowable but not advisable. Therefore, we are reviewing all associated guidance.\u201d\n\nDemocrats in Congress are eyeing legislation to put a stop to the practice altogether.\n\nNearly three dozen Democratic senators this week co-sponsored a bill that would make it illegal for the federal government to spend taxpayer dollars at properties owned by the president, vice president or members of the Cabinet.\n\nThe Heightened Oversight of Travel, Eating, and Lodging, or HOTEL, Act was introduced by Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), a member of the Armed Services Committee and the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n\u201cAs elected officials, we must hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards and ensure that we are using taxpayer dollars responsibly,\u201d Peters said in a statement.\n\nPeters has also requested a formal probe of the Air Force\u2019s use of Turnberry by the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general. A spokeswoman for the IG, Dwrena Allen, declined to discuss the status of his request.\n\nBen Schreckinger contributed to this report.", "description": "The spending paid for the equivalent of hundreds of nights of rooms over approximately three dozen separate stays, the committee said.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand", "Bryan Bender"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a5/42/2c1a240444a69bbb72c09c1e91f0/19918-turnberry-gt-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
