Ireland also bring on substitute flanker Rhys Ruddock for Peter O'Mahony, while Japan replace tighthed prop Ji-won Koo for Asaeli Valu at tighthead and fullback Ryohei Yamanaka for Kenki Fukuoka.\n\nJapan also change their scrum-halves with Fuminaki Tanaka replacing Yutaka Nagare.\n\n9:40AM\n\n54 min: Japan miss chance to draw level Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nTamura has another chance to register some points around halfway but his kick sails to the left once more. The Japanese still trail by 3 but they have Ireland rattled.\n\n9:37AM\n\n51 min: Audacious step! Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nThat was an outrageous step from Japan's Matsushima down the left wing. Japan have since lost possession but that might have been the best piece of footwork of the tournament so far.\n\nPlay resumes around halfway with Japan in possession after Ireland kick to release some pressure.\n\n9:36AM\n\n50 min; Ireland penalty Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nJapan concede the penalty for collapsing the scrum and allow Ireland the chance to kick to the corner once more.\n\nCould a driving maul try be on the cards here?\n\nNo! Ireland lose their own lineout and Japan are able to clear! But Tamura makes an error and misses touch. Ireland go through the phases in the Japanese half.\n\n9:34AM\n\n48 min: Break in play Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nThe forwards will be grateful for our brief break in play here after Japan knock on.\n\nIreland have a scrum on the Japanese 10 metre line and will be looking to impose their physical presence once again after a 25-minute period that's been all Japan.\n\n9:29AM\n\n47 min: Subs Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nIreland make changes at 1 and 3 with Cian Healy and Tadhg Furlong replaced by David Kilcoyne and Andrew Porter.\n\n9:28AM\n\n46 min: I need a breather!! Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nThat was a frantic few minutes for Ireland with Japan pressurising the men in green and stealing the ball from the back of the ruck. The home side took the ball to the line again and fund luck once more with those quick hands of theirs.\n\nBut, they can't quite land a killer blow. Ireland have a dropout. Japan's ball again, this could be exhausting.\n\n9:24AM\n\n41 min: Carty finds space Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nCarty finds space to kick behind Japan's defence to play the field. Japan lose the ball from the set-piece move but have it back again almost instantly.\n\nThe Brave Blossoms are progressing into the Irish half.\n\n9:22AM\n\n40 min: Second-half underway Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nTamura gets us underway for the second 40, but Japan knock on from their own kick-off and allow Ireland a scrum within their own half.\n\n9:21AM\n\nJapan head out early\n\nWe've not returned to play yet but Japan are already out on the pitch doing short sprints. Looks like they're keen to carry on their first-half momentum!\n\n9:19AM\n\nWho'll give out first?\n\nWhich team's game will come good by the final whistle in Fukuroi today? Will Ireland's forward power combine with Carty's deft distribution skills to push past the underdogs? Or will the Japanese temp continue to put the visitors under pressure for another historic World Cup victory?\n\nIt could go either way, but Ireland still stand as favourites.\n\n9:13AM\n\nThe perfect place for Rugby Nerds with The Telegraph\n\n9:12AM\n\nHalf-time: Hosts turn on the pressure before half-time Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nIreland got off to an impressive start with two tries through Garry Ringrose and Rob Kearney, with Connacht fly-half Jack Carty showing off some excellent attacking kicks.\n\nBut, Japan turned on the pressure after Ireland's early dominance, disrupting the Irish lineout and scrum. Fast hands and dynamic carrying from the home side eventually saw Ireland concede a number of penalties to bring Japan within 3, and could have been level had fly-half Tamura not sent his first kick wide.\n\nThere is plenty to come from both sides here in an enthralling game.\n\n9:06AM\n\n43 min: Half-time Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nThe clocks in the red but Japan won't relent! They won a scrum from the restart after Carty's kick went out on the full.\n\nA neat grubber to the left corner for Lemeki just beats the wing to the touchline and we're into the changing rooms!\n\n9:02AM\n\n39 min: Japan kick for sticks again Japan 9 Ireland 12\n\nIreland concede another penalty within their own half and Tamura lines up his fourth shot at goal for the day.\n\nHe nails the kick and bring Japan to within 3 just before half-time! The first half isn't over yet!\n\n9:00AM\n\nSkills on show\n\nNo look pass is oh so good from Japan's Timothy Lafaele #JPNvIRE#RWC2019\n\n\n\nFind out where you can watch at https://t.co/z0BgdPH0sfpic.twitter.com/MqmCTrALMU\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) September 28, 2019\n\n9:00AM\n\n35 min: Aggressive Japanese defence Japan 6 Ireland 12\n\nJapan force the turnover from Carty\n\nIreland are stumped by an aggressive Japanese defence but concede the knock-on during a double tackle on Carty.\n\nJapan win the scrum penalty against the head and the crows make their appreciation known. A huge moment for Japan as they kick for a lineout just within Ireland's half.\n\n8:55AM\n\n33 min: Japan penalty! Japan 6 Ireland 12\n\nIreland concede another penalty at the breakdown not from from their own posts. Tamura kicks the three again to bring his side within six points.\n\n8:53AM\n\n31 min: Ireland lineout Japan 3 Ireland 12\n\nJapan are back at it again with the ball in hand but concede a penalty at the breakdown. Ireland kick for another lineout just inside Japan's half.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan's star number eight Mafi is off with that looks like a rib injury. Captain Leitch takes to the field.\n\nJapan steal the lineout possession and quickly make it to Ireland's 15 metre line through the newly-arrived Leitch! Real momentum here for the Brave Blossoms.\n\n8:47AM\n\n26 min: Fast hands and nifty offloads Japan 3 Ireland 12\n\nJapan show some nice handling skills to push the Irish defence onto its heels. A chip and chase from free-scoring wing Matsushima is gathered by Josh Van der Flier and Ireland clear.\n\nThis game is really opening up.\n\n8:44AM\n\n23 min: Carty's at it again! Japan 3 Ireland 12\n\nYou can't stop Carty from kicking! He send a dink overhead and Kearney gathers again. He sprints through but can't get the ball away to Earls. Ireland go through a few more phases but giant tighthead prop Tadhg Furlong knocks on inside Japan's 22.\n\nThe hosts get a scrum and begin their own phase play.\n\n8:41AM\n\n21 min :Try Ireland! Japan 3 Ireland 12\n\nIreland show off some deceptive dummy lines from the set-piece and Carty sends the long pass over to Stockdale down the left wing. The Ulsterman is brought to ground but Ireland attack through the middle and Carty is at it again from the boot. He chips over the top this time from 10 metres out.\n\nKearney gathers and squeezes over for the try!\n\nCarty finishes it off with his first successful kick of the day to make it 3-12 in Ireland's favour.\n\n8:37AM\n\n19 min: Maul turnover Japan 3 Ireland 5\n\nJapan are forced into a maul as Lemeki is held up in the tackle. They drive a good 10 metres but go to ground, turnover and a scrum to Ireland on Japan's 22 again.\n\nIreland win the scrum penalty and go to the corner.\n\n8:35AM\n\n17 min: Japan penalty! Japan 3 Ireland 5\n\nAgain Japan are straight into Ireland with a high-tempo attack. It's CJ Stander that concedes a penalty for being offside this time and Tamura has another shot at goal.\n\nHe makes no mistake this time and Japan are on the board.\n\n8:33AM\n\n14 min: Try! Japan 0 Ireland 5\n\nTry Ireland! Connacht man Carty goes to the boot again and this time he finds Ringrose, the man that sparked the attack.\n\nRingrose evades the first tackler and spins to score the first points of the day.\n\nCarty sends the conversion just wide to the right.\n\n8:31AM\n\n12 min: Ireland threaten: Japan 0 Ireland 0\n\nIreland find some space to attack down the left wing but can't quite complete. Joe Schmidt's men are back with a lineout on Japan's 22 and are beginning to threaten.\n\nOh, Ringrose breaks through but is dragged down by the defence! Ireland turn to phase play 15 metres out with their superior tight game.\n\n8:28AM\n\n9 min: Close miss Japan 0 Ireland 0\n\nAfter another penalty in the midfield Carty takes it kick and kicks cross-field to Keith Earls. It doesn't quite come off and Japan have a lineout within 5metres of their own line and clear the ball to halfway.\n\n8:26AM\n\n7 min: Straight back in Japan 0 Ireland 0\n\nWe restart through the boot of Carty and Japan are straight back at the Irish, with number eight Aminaki Mafi almost breaking through the green defensive line.\n\nBut O'Mahony is back at the breakdown within a few phases and wins Ireland the penalty this time. Ireland kick to for a lineout just inside Japan's 22.\n\n8:23AM\n\n6 min: Penalty! Japan 0 Ireland 0\n\nIreland's Peter O'Mahony is penalised at the breakdown just inside his own half, Japan's Yu Tamura lines up the sticks and... send it wide left!\n\nEarly opportunity to take the led lost by the hosts.\n\n8:22AM\n\n4 min: Close call! Japan 0 Ireland 0\n\nA neat grubber from Japan nearly sees the hosts claim a score within the first 5 minutes! The bounce beats Kotaro Matsushima and Jacob Stockdale gathers the ball.\n\n8:20AM\n\n1 min: Late change Japan 0 Ireland 0\n\nThere's a late change for Japan here, Will Tupou is replaced on the left wing by Lomano Lemeki.\n\nJapan are taking the game to Ireland here in typically expansive fashion. They may not be as big, but they're certainly out of the blocks sprinting today.\n\n8:17AM\n\n0 min: Kick-off! Japan 0 Ireland 0\n\nAnd we're underway in Fukuroi through the boot of Ireland's Jack Carty!\n\n8:14AM\n\nOne to watch: Ireland\n\nJames Ryan is the one to watch for Ireland Credit: PA\n\nWhile Japan will be hoping to open the game up, Ireland will want to drag their opponents into an arm wrestle. Leinster lock James Ryan is a herculean forward that will take some serious stopping in defence. You feel that if Ireland are to take the win today and ensure their spot at the top of the pool, Ryan\u2019s muscular carrying game will shine through.\n\n8:10AM\n\nEverything you need to know, throughout the tournament, right here\n\n8:06AM\n\nJapan upset on the cards?\n\nIs there much room for a Japanese upset today? Absolutely. Ireland are in menacing form after their quashing of Scotland last week, but without Jonathan Sexton pulling the strings from ten, there's a fair chance a high-tempo performance from Japan with strike runners coming around the corner and into space could shock an Ireland outfit bereft of its on-field general.\n\n7:47AM\n\n\"We've got to take a few risks, obviously, we're playing a quality side.\"\n\n\"I don't think anyone gives us a chance to win the test match...\"\n\n\n\nJamie Joseph on @JRFURugby dealing with the pressure of #JPNvIRE#RWC2019#RWCShizuokapic.twitter.com/1m4sy0mObI\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) September 28, 2019\n\n7:39AM\n\nTeam news\n\nIreland:\n\nStarting XV: Cian Healy, Rory Best, Tadhg Furlong, Iain henderson, James Ryan, Peter O'Mahony, Josh Van der Flier, CJ Stander, Conor Murray, Jack Carty, Jacob Stockdale, Chris Farrell, Garry Ringrose, Keith Earls, Rob Kearney\n\nBench: Sean Cronin, Dave Kilcoyne, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Beirne, Rhys Ruddock, Luke McGrath, Joey Carbery, Jordan Larmour\n\nJapan:\n\nStarting XV: Ryohei Yamanaka; Kotaro Matsushima, Timothy Lafaele, Ryoto Nakamura, Will Tupou; Yu Tamura, Yutaka Nagare; Keita Inagaki, Shota Horie, Jiwon Koo; Luke Thompson, James Moore; Kazuki Himeno, Pieter Labuschagne, Amanaki Lelei Mafi.\n\nBench: Atsushi Sakate, Isileli Nakajima, Asaeli Ai Valu, Wimpie van der Walt, Michael Leitch, Fumiaki Tanaka, Rikiya Matsuda, Lomano Lemeki\n\n7:22AM\n\nIreland's final pool stage hurdle\n\nIt\u2019s the final significant hurdle for Ireland in Fukuroi today on their path to the top of Pool A, tackling their tournament hosts, Jamie Joseph\u2019s Japan. Like their guests, the Brave Blossoms are undefeated thus far in the tournament and are looking to continue their run with a victory, although Joe Schmidt\u2019s men in green are the firm favourites.\n\nIreland pushed roughly past Scotland 27-3 in their first game last Sunday, causing many to forget the 57-15 humbling at the hands of a powerful England side during the warm-up games and lending further belief in the Irish team\u2019s place as the second ranked team in the world and potential World Cup winners.\n\nChalk up another tick in the \u2018win\u2019 column against Japan today will see Ireland all but guaranteed the top spot in their pool and a, marginally, easier path to the semi-finals; facing South Africa instead of reigning back-to-back world champions New Zealand in the quarter-finals.\n\nSchmidt has been denied the ability to start star fly-half Jonathan Sexton after the Leinster standoff struggled with a groin issue during the game against Scotland, handing kicking duties to his halfback partner Conor Murray. Muscular inside centre Bundee Aki has also been left out of the squad after suffering a head injury last time out, despite passing his head injury assessments with flying colours. Ireland have replaced power with power in the shape of Chris Farrell in the twelve jersey, and will undoubtedly cause the Japanese defence some problems throughout the day.\n\nOver in the Japan camp, Joseph has made some surprise selections of his own, leaving out long-term captain Michael Leitch from the starting XV. The New Zealand-born flanker is dropped to the bench as first-choice, all-action number eight Aminaki Mafi returns from injury. Mafi\u2019s comeback sees last week\u2019s number eight and standout forward Kazuki Himeno shifted into Leitch\u2019s usual six jersey to complete a dynamic backrow with South African-born openside Pieter Labuschagne. Clearly, Japan are hoping to take the action to Ireland.\n\nCause an upset today and register a win against Ireland, as they did against the storied Springboks four years ago, and Japan have the chance to top the pool after entering as the third highest-ranked team in the group.
