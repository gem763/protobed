SoulCycle\u2019s website makes the sign-up data for every class publicly available, and each class is scheduled individually and purchased either individually or in small packages\u2014there is no option for a monthly or annual membership\u2014so sign-up data can be followed in real time. (In the case of Equinox and other gyms that offer longer-term membership plans complete with early termination fees, any effect would be expected to lag.)\n\nEarnest compared sign-ups at locations across the United States over a period of 18 days before and 18 days after the fundraiser news. During that time, the average decline in sign-ups was 12.8 percent.\n\n\u201cWe looked at historic data, and there was no other dip like this,\u201d says Ried Niziak, a data scientist with Earnest. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that the boycott has driven down attendance at SoulCycle.\u201d Eudora Erickson, another data analyst at the company, concurred.", "description": "", "authors": ["James Hamblin", "Theatlantic.Com Health Archive Soulcycle-Boycott"], "top_image": ""}
