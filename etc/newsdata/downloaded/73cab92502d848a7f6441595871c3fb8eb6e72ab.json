News of France giving the EU until the end of the week to deliver an alternative solution to the Irish backstop merely delivered more false hope than an actual belief of a deal being reached.\n\nFrench President Macron\u2019s offer of more time may ultimately be nothing more than a smokescreen.\n\nThe British government has continued to deflect blame over the Brexit calamity to the EU. An offer of more time is certainly a softer stance than even a week ago.\n\nWhen considering the time it took to deliver the last proposal, which was largely dismissed by Brussels, an 11th October deadline looks set to scupper the PM\u2019s ambition of solving the Brexit puzzle.\n\nThe Pound\n\nAt the time of writing, the Pound was up by 0.04% to $1.2296.\n\nA lack of progress on Brexit continues to pin back the Pound. One area of support, however, is the expectation of an extension.\n\nThere is an element of disbelief that the British PM will be able to ignore the Benn Act.\n\nAssuming that the British PM does make a request for an extension, however, there are likely to be more fireworks to follow.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nIn the wake of the Tory Party Conference, there\u2019s been no progress. With France having given Britain until 11th October, all that is left is for Johnson to request an extension.\n\nA number of member states, including a vocal France, continue to be against any further delays.\n\nBoris Johnson would need to demonstrate likely progress in support of an extension request. Simply being forced to make a request as per the newly legislated Benn Act may not be enough.\n\nA general election, however, could give Macron reasonable grounds to support an extension. An extension until 31st January 2020 may be a stretch, however.\n\nFor the British PM, a failure to deliver Brexit on 31st October is unlikely to lead to a loss of pro-Brexit voters.\n\nThe Benn Act has assured that even in failing to deliver Brexit, Johnson can say that he did his best. Few would contest with such sentiment with just 3-weeks remaining until Halloween.\n\nA General Election\n\nNews of Boris Johnson getting election preparations underway will, however, throws the Pound into further uncertainty.\n\nFrom a Tory perspective, Johnson will hope that there are enough pro-Brexit voters to deliver a no strings attached Brexit. For the EU, this would be the worst-case scenario. Well, for those who have any concerns over a no-deal Brexit and its impact on the regional economy\u2026\n\nFor Opposition Party leader Corbyn, a call for a general election will be a judgment day. Having flip-flopped on Brexit, is it self-interest or the interest of the nation that will prevail?\n\nThe assumption is that Corbyn may not be able to garner the necessary support to fend off a Johnson victory. Recent polls suggest just that\u2026\n\nAs things stand, an EU extension to allow for a UK General Election seems logical. This would allow Britain to address the Brexit Impasse once and for all.\n\nSupport for Johnson has been on the rise in the last week. If Corbyn doesn\u2019t step down, it may become a battle between the Tories and the Lib Dems.", "description": "With the EU continuing to dismiss Brexit proposals, it may well end up in the hands of the British voter to decide the fate once more.", "authors": ["Bob Mason"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sMX0yKN0xYkrNKvaPEOn0Q--~B/aD01ODY7dz03NjE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/56c7653830afe1fb07de67082bc0129c", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
