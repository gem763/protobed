This is the kind of country Japan is.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe turnaround in his luck was meeting a fan: \u2018There was a banker at the biggest bank [in Japan] who was a huge fan of mine, and I got the financing\u2019.\n\nAnd when he had trouble finding a decent building to house his new studio, called Kojima Productions, apparently that was down to a landlord who also turned out to be a fan.\n\n\u2018The reason why I\u2019m who I am now is because of the 30 years I had at Konami,\u2019 said Kojima. \u2018I am grateful to Konami, and I cannot deny that connection.\u2019\n\nAs Kotaku notes though, Kojima seems to be exaggerating his situation a little. He might not have had the spare cash to set-up a multi-million games studio, but he hardly would\u2019ve been penniless when leaving Konami, especially as he seemed to walk straight into a sweetheart deal with Sony.\n\nHis assertion that \u2018there hasn\u2019t been a single world-famous game designer who has had success after striking out on their own\u2019 is also disingenuous, although he was no doubt thinking of specific Japanese examples when he said that.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Death Stranding Bridge Baby speaks through PS4 controller\u2019s speaker reveals Hideo Kojima\n\nMORE: Norman Reedus doesn\u2019t like you staring at his crotch in Death Stranding\n\nMORE: Death Stranding explained in massive 48 minute Tokyo Game Show demo", "description": "The creator of Metal Gear has revealed he may never have started his own company if it wasn\u2019t for help from fans, including his landlord.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kojima_meg_messze_van_a_the_phantom_pain_megjelenese-e1426779542586_1570725130.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
