Leaving the dock, he said: \u201cThank you, your honour, thank you to the jury, and thank you to my dentist.\u201d\n\nThe former Newcastle United player had told the court he kissed the woman to \u201cgive her some confidence\u201d after, he claimed, she was insulted about her weight by another passenger.\n\nThe court heard Gascoigne had been drinking lager on the Birmingham-to-Edinburgh train, with witnesses describing how he was surrounded by empty cans and had offered gin and tonic to other passengers.\n\nWitnesses told the jury his speech was slurred and he had food smeared across his face \u2013 he admitted that at one point he had cake on his forehead as he was \u201cmessing about\u201d with his teenage nephews.\n\nBut the trial centred on whether the kiss was sexual. The judge, Peter Armstrong, told jurors they must be sure beyond reasonable doubt that the kiss was a sexual act or that Gascoigne had a sexual motive in order to find him guilty.\n\nThe former Tottenham Hotspur and Everton player insisted the act was not sexual and refused to apologise while giving evidence.\n\n\u201cI was not drunk, I was not forceful, I was not sexual. I was just reacting to the lady getting called fat and ugly,\u201d he told jurors from the witness box.\n\nGascoigne said he had been posing for photographs with passengers when he overheard someone shout about the complainant: \u201cWhy would you want a photo with her for? She\u2019s fat and ugly.\u201d\n\nThat was a lie, the prosecution claimed, and there were no witnesses in the trial who said they heard the woman be insulted about her weight, or any to back Gascoigne\u2019s assertion that the complainant took his photo with two women sitting opposite her. In fact, the two women denied they had a picture with the former footballer and told jurors they tried to ignore him.\n\nGiving evidence, Gascoigne described how he had felt moved to \u201creassure\u201d the woman after the supposed insult because he had experienced bulimia and been criticised for his weight throughout his playing career. \u201cI was called a fat bastard every time I played,\u201d he said.\n\nGascoigne\u2019s barrister, Michelle Heeley QC, told jurors the former footballer kissed a woman who was not expecting it and did not like it, but that did not make him a sexual offender.\n\nShe said the kiss lasted two or three seconds, on a packed train, and was not preceded by any \u201clecherous comment\u201d, touching or groping. She told the jury the kiss might have been \u201cmisplaced\u201d, but it was not sexual, adding: \u201cYou cannot be sure Mr Gascoigne had a sexual intent. He has been consistent throughout, he didn\u2019t kiss [the complainant] for any other reason in his mind than to reassure her that she was not fat or ugly.\u201d\n\nGascoigne briefly became emotional when he recalled the death of his nephew Jay Kerrigan from a drugs overdose aged 22 in April 2016. He had had mental health problems including anorexia.\n\nAlthough Gascoigne has rarely been away from the headlines over the past two decades, the trial gave a brief insight into the often-chaotic life of the troubled former footballer.\n\nHe told the court he recently had anti-alcohol pellets injected into his stomach \u2013 believed to be the same operation George Best had before his death in 2005 \u2013 in an effort to overcome his addiction. Gascoigne said that since the operation, he would automatically \u201cspew\u201d if he drank spirits, but he still drinks lager.\n\nHe also disclosed how an assault three years ago left him with permanently damaged teeth and needing prosthetic dentures, which he at one point removed to demonstrate to the jury why his speech was slurred during the train incident.\n\nWhile he was cheered on daily by supporters outside the courtroom, the only flash of his celebrity status came during his defence when Heeley showed jurors a four-page montage of him kissing and being kissed by stars including Princess Diana, whose hand he pecked shortly before the FA Cup final in 1991 \u2013 a game that ended in ignominy for him when he limped off injured after rupturing a cruciate ligament with a shocking high tackle, leaving him in tears while his teammates collected the trophy.\n\nGascoigne\u2019s former agent Mel Stein and the boxing stars Ricky Hatton and Jane Couch gave glowing character testimonies for the defence, describing how their friend was naturally tactile and would give anyone a hug and kiss but, said Couch, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t take it the wrong way\u201d.\n\nThe prosecution tried unsuccessfully to have Gascoigne\u2019s past crimes read to the jury, arguing his convictions for offences including battery, criminal damage, drink-driving and religiously aggravated harassment \u201cbrought some balance\u201d to a character reference by Gascoigne\u2019s longtime friend and former counsellor Paul Spanjar, who described him as \u201cone of the most generous people I\u2019ve ever met \u2026 a natural carer and a very honest and straight guy\u201d.\n\nIn the end, the jury of eight men and four women were not told about Gascoigne\u2019s previous convictions and they decided they could not find him guilty of sexual assault or assault by beating.", "description": "Ex-footballer acquitted of sexual assault and alternative charge of assault by beating", "authors": ["Josh Halliday"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b3509136cfd0f54bead7d77f2aeb6d0e8e11da/0_62_1811_1086/master/1811.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7d49d6743f11dffab461f281eb3325da", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
