It has been valued at $1 billion \u2014 a fortune in the Israeli tech environment, where the most successful companies get acquired for less than $500 million. And it's wildly profitable, Business Insider can report: It made $125 million in profit last year.\n\nAll that money has spawned a new web of highly specialized startups funded by NSO Group's founders and investors, known in tech circles as \"the NSO Mafia,\" which sell niche tools to penetrate WiFi routers, home speakers, and other devices.\n\nThese companies often describe their wares as \"lawful interception\" or \"intelligence\" tools, though this hardly tells the full story. They all sell tools that take devices and turn them against their users to secretly spy without leaving a trace.\n\nWhatever you call this technology, business is booming. Governments and law enforcement agencies around the world are paying millions of dollars. And startups both inside of Israel and out are ready to sell.", "description": "NSO Group's founders and alumni have spawned a web of more than a dozen similar startups, many of which operate in secret,", "authors": ["Becky Peterson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d5ff6502e22af5d4342fc38-1136-568.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
