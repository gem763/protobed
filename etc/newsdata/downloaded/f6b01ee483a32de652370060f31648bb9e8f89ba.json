REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s caretaker government met on Sunday in the Jordan Valley, a largely agricultural area which he announced on Tuesday that he intends to annex if he wins a fifth term. Israeli cabinets have rarely held sessions in the West Bank.\n\nAt the meeting, the government announced it had approved Netanyahu\u2019s proposal to turn the outpost of Mevo\u2019ot Yericho into a formal settlement - 20 years after it was established as a farming community in the Jordan Valley without state sanction.\n\nIn public remarks at the session, Netanyahu said it would be up to the government formed after Tuesday\u2019s election to grant final approval.\n\nThe timing of the cabinet\u2019s move was widely seen in Israel as another bid by Netanyahu to swing support from small ultranationalist parties to his right-wing Likud in an election that follows an inconclusive poll in April.\n\nJust days after voicing anger over Netanyahu\u2019s Jordan Valley annexation plan, Palestinians said no Israeli government decision could give legitimacy to settlements in occupied territory.\n\n\u201cThe Palestinian people are the only decision-makers on their land,\u201d said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nSIMILAR AGENDA\n\nAppealing to far-right voters and Likud\u2019s own supporters to turn out in large numbers, Netanyahu has been portraying himself as being in lockstep with ultranationalists over retaining West Bank land through annexation.\n\nBallots cast for far-right parties, rather than for Likud, he has said, could deny it victory in a close race. In Israel, voters choose a party\u2019s list of parliamentary candidates, rather than individuals.\n\nOpinion polls show Likud and its main challenger, the centrist Blue and White party led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, running neck and neck, meaning coalition-building is key to determining an ultimate winner.\n\nScores of outposts, unauthorized by Israeli governments, dot the West Bank, in addition to some 120 settlements that have been built in the area since its capture in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nThe Palestinians and many countries consider all Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal under the Geneva Conventions relating to occupied territory. Israel disputes this, citing security needs and biblical, historical and political connections to the land.\n\nPalestinians seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stepped up a bid for far-right votes two days before a closely-contested election, convening his cabinet in the occupied West Bank and having it approve legal status for an unauthorized outpost.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430132050&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0GM-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
