Saba, in its SEC filing announcing the stake it took in the funds, wrote that Western's board structure \u2014 which Saba claims protects incumbents \u2014 \"is strong proof that the board is not acting in the best interests of its shareholders.\"\n\nSee more: WorldQuant's Igor Tulchinsky just guaranteed his team 75% of last year's performance bonus to soothe nerves as quant funds get slammed\n\nBut what is unique to this fight is that those would stand to benefit from a Saba victory include investor EnTrust Global, a $20 billion fund-of-hedge funds that is owned by Legg Mason.\n\nWhile Saba's campaigns have pushed BlackRock to sue the hedge fund and Neuberger Berman has stated that Saba's activism violates the decades-long law that governs retail funds, this is the first time Weinstein gotten support from one side of a manager and pushback from another.\n\nIn a statement, Legg Mason states that its affiliates are free to invest in what they believe is the best option for their clients.\n\nSee more: D.E.

Western, also with investment independence, believes that they are proactively taking many steps to manage that fund on behalf of all of the closed end investors that invest in it, and they are making that case in the Saba matter, with shareholders and others,\" the statement reads.\n\nEnTrust and Saba declined to comment.\n\nWeinstein, who was the co-head of credit trading at Deutsche before starting Saba, has made activism in closed-end funds, which trade on exchanges like stocks, a more common occurrence. Asset managers however claim the fund's technique harms retail investors, who are often invested in closed-end funds for the income earned from distributions instead of the discount from the share price.", "description": "Boaz Weinstein's hedge fund counts Legg Mason affiliate EnTrust Global as an investor, while taking a proxy fight to Legg's Western Asset Management.", "authors": ["Bradley Saacks"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9240752e22af4c050e7dfe?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
