More than three years after the referendum vote to leave the EU, there is still no obvious way out of the stalemate.\n\nLawmakers voted 328 to 301 to make time this week for Parliament to debate a law\u2014now highly likely to pass\u2014that would require Mr. Johnson to ask the EU for Brexit to be delayed until the end of January 2020 if he doesn\u2019t secure a deal with the bloc in October to manage Britain\u2019s exit.\n\nThe prime minister has said such parliamentary action would limit his ability to negotiate with the EU, as he could no longer use the threat of a disruptive break with the bloc to squeeze out better divorce terms. As a result, he said he would have no option but to call for a snap election next month if the law was approved on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cEveryone will know that if I am prime minister, I will go to Brussels, I will go for a deal and get a deal but if they won\u2019t do a deal we will leave anyway on 31 October,\u201d Mr. Johnson said after the vote. \u201cThe people of this country will have to choose.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson said he would put an election call to lawmakers on Wednesday. Two-thirds of lawmakers would have to vote to approve the holding of an election for one to take place.\n\nBut the election call seemed unlikely to succeed after Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party\u2014as well as the heads of the centrist Liberal Democrats and of the Scottish National Party\u2014said they wouldn\u2019t back an election until a no-deal exit on Oct. 31 was ruled out.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote to proceed toward the delay came amid a day of high drama in Britain\u2019s Parliament. Several high-profile former ministers, including former Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, were among the 21 Conservative lawmakers who rebelled against the government, an act that Mr. Johnson\u2019s aides said would result in their being barred from running on the Conservatives\u2019 ticket at the next election and triggering a near unprecedented cull of lawmakers from the party.\n\nBut expelling the 21 would pile further pressure on Mr. Johnson, whose government on Tuesday also lost its razor-thin majority in the lower house after a Conservative lawmaker defected to the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats just as Mr. Johnson stood in the chamber to make a speech.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is Boris Johnson right to hold an election to break the Brexit impasse?

Last week, Mr. Johnson said Parliament will be suspended beginning next week for around a month. That means opposition lawmakers must rush legislation through both the lower house and the House of Lords in record time if they are to succeed.\n\nFor Mr. Johnson, Tuesday\u2019s vote presents an early test of his premiership. Since he became leader in July, he has repeatedly pledged to leave the EU on Oct. 31 and deliver on the referendum vote held back in 2016. \u201cI am confident of getting a deal...there will be no pointless further dither,\u201d Mr. Johnson said earlier in the day, urging lawmakers not to hamper negotiations by forcing an extension.\n\nAs Boris Johnson becomes the U.K.\u2019s new prime minister, WSJ\u2019s Max Colchester examines what kind of relationship the new leader will have with President Trump. Photo: Zuma Press\n\nA key plank in Mr. Johnson\u2019s strategy is ensuring that come the end of October, British lawmakers and the EU alike are faced with the choice between agreeing on a deal and an abrupt and potentially disruptive split with a major trading partner.\n\nWithout this tension, Mr. Johnson said it is impossible to get the EU to offer concessions or British lawmakers to vote for any deal. His predecessor, Theresa May, twice delayed Brexit, and the deal her government negotiated was repeatedly voted down by British lawmakers.\n\nMr. Johnson dubbed the law the opposition is trying to pass \u201cThe Jeremy Corbyn Surrender Bill.\u201d The prime minister told the House of Commons on Tuesday he was making good progress on talks with the EU, but his opponents and some European officials said they are still awaiting tangible proposals from London.\n\nMr. Johnson is set on Monday to visit Dublin, where he said he would make a more detailed proposal to resolve questions over how to avoid building a border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.\n\nCalling a third general election in just over four years could throw even more uncertainty into the Brexit mix, opening the possibility of the opposition Labour Party taking the reins in Parliament. Mr. Corbyn, its left-wing leader, has already outlined plans to nationalize various industries, spooking some investors. The party has said it would negotiate a different Brexit deal and put it to a referendum.\n\nWith an election looking increasingly likely, Mr. Johnson has toured the U.K., promising fresh funds for police and schools. He regularly visits British hospitals to talk up his attachment to the popular nationalized health service.\n\nSo far Mr. Johnson\u2019s approach has translated into a bounce in the polls. The Conservatives lead Labour by 8 points, according to a recent poll of polls by Britain Elects. However, analysts said there is a high possibility that a vote results in another hung Parliament with no party gaining an outright majority.\n\n\u201cThere will be bumps in the road,\u201d Mr. Johnson said of Brexit. \u201cBut we will get it done.\u201d\n\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com", "description": "U.K. lawmakers delivered a blow to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy with a vote aimed at delaying the country\u2019s exit from the European Union, prompting the British leader to call for a general election.", "authors": ["Max Colchester", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103683/social"}
