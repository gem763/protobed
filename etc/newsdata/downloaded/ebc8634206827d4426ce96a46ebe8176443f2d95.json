It was one of those things when I tried to get that remote out of his hand and there was just no having it.\n\n\u2018He was like, \u201cNo, no, no, no, this is happening.\u201d I just kept walking in and out, cringing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone has to start somewhere, hun.\n\nWhile it may not have been her screen debut \u2013 which came in 1988 thanks to an uncredited part in Mac And Me \u2013 Jen still felt it was a \u2018big deal\u2019.\n\nJen starred in Leprechaun, back in 1993 (Picture: YouTube)\n\n\u2018I really thought I arrived when I did Leprechaun\u2019 she joked. \u2018It was with Warwick Davis, the guy from Willow was in it. It was a big deal!\u2019\n\n\u2018I really did think it was an amazing thing that I was in a movie,\u2019 Aniston said.\n\nUnfortunately for Jen, it wasn\u2019t quite as big a deal as she thought, only racking up $8.5million (\u00a36.9m) at the box office.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all bad, as she went to land a role in Friends very shortly after, and the rest is history.\n\nJennifer is living her best single life right now (Picture: Rex)\n\nJennifer and Justin split back in 2017, two years after tying the knot in an intimate wedding.\n\nAnd she revealed she isn\u2019t quite ready to mingle right now and is loving being single instead.\n\nWhen asked if she was enjoying the single life, she explained that she has absolutely no interest in being thrown into a blind date.\n\n\u2018Hey, listen, I just don\u2019t like being set up. I don\u2019t like it. I hate it,\u2019 she told the host.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the Marley & Me actress has no time for a relationship, as she\u2019s busy securing her bag.\n\n\u2018Yeah, and I\u2019m very busy. For now,\u2019 she added. \u2018I\u2019m promoting [The Morning Show]. I\u2019m prepping for next season.\u2019\n\nWhich is fair enough.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
