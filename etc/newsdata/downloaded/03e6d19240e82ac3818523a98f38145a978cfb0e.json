He basically didn\u2019t want to sell anything but agreed to a minor sell down for liquidity.\"\n\nThe only other time Mr White had sold shares was again to attain the liquidity required for Wisetech to enter the S &P/ASX 200, which has left his shareholding valued at around $4.5 billion.\n\n\"My initial read of this report is that it has made some serious 'mistakes' in its analysis, and there is nothing in the report that would change my view on the company,\" he concluded.", "description": "BHP looks internally for new CEO; Appeal period on IOOF, APRA case lapses; Seven West Media to merge with Prime, divest Redwave to Southern Cross.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1779%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/72ff8c6683e832ca42532937bdadbc0eb011f0a1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
