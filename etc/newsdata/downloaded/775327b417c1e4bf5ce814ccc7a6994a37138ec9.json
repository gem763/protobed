To get Brooks talking about his past, ask directly about Westbrook and he will slip into a monologue in praise of and defense for his oft-maligned former point guard.\n\nBring up Harden, and Brooks, as he did unprovoked last season, will cast his MVP vote for his former player, whose style of play is like a pumpkin-spiced beer: You either love it or detest its very existence.\n\nThough Brooks\u2019s allegiance belongs to the Wizards (1-2), who host the Rockets on Wednesday in their home opener, he is a big fan of Harden and Westbrook.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re two of my favorite players I\u2019ve ever coached,\u201d Brooks said after practice Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of respect for them because I\u2019ve seen all the work that they\u2019ve put in.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBrooks may come off as curt when addressing the Thunder. And why not? He was fired in 2015, and any homecoming narratives have grown stale. He has long since moved on, and that franchise no longer looks like the one he coached to the 2012 NBA Finals. But on the topic of any of the three league MVPs he coached as young pros \u2014 Kevin Durant, Harden and Westbrook \u2014 Brooks gushes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to go down as one of the best point guards to ever play the game,\u201d Brooks said of Westbrook. \u201cHe\u2019s averaged a triple-double for multiple years \u2026 and it\u2019s, like, not a big deal. I think you guys are doing him a big disservice, the media, by not talking about that more.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLast week, from his hotel room in Oklahoma City, Brooks watched Westbrook\u2019s debut with the Rockets and Harden, the first time they have been paired as fully realized superstars. Almost a week later, Brooks can recount the score and segment of the game in which things started to slip away from the Rockets as the Milwaukee Bucks came back to beat them. He watched closely not just because Houston was an upcoming opponent but because he has a rooting interest in the lives and careers of Westbrook and Harden.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo see those guys where they are now and being up front and close and very personal with their growth,\u201d Brooks said, \u201cI feel good about my little bit that I\u2019ve helped them throughout their career.\u201d\n\nIn those early years in Oklahoma City, Durant, Westbrook and Harden, without the overgrown beard, were high lottery picks on their way toward stardom. Still, someone had to teach them how to be pros. Arguably, one of Brooks\u2019s greatest coaching strengths has been developing young talent, a reputation he gained with that trio.\n\nAD\n\nIn Washington, Brooks has shown that same quality; for instance, Bradley Beal has become an all-star in two of the three seasons he has played in Brooks\u2019s system. While there are other circumstances in play \u2014 Beal\u2019s drive to improve; the larger role he adopted as John Wall healed from injuries \u2014 a coach also deserves some recognition for creating opportunities for the player to flourish or for simply getting out of his way.\n\nAD\n\nFive of the Wizards in Brooks\u2019s 10-player rotation are 22 or younger, making the coach lean on his developmental skills more than ever.\n\n\u201cPlaying the right way always wins games,\u201d said 20-year-old Troy Brown Jr., repeating the message he has heard often in his brief time under Brooks. \u201cHe emphasizes that a lot. He\u2019ll stop practice and literally be like, \u2018Make the extra pass,\u2019 and correct us to play the right way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBrooks, at least publicly, doesn\u2019t reflect on his Oklahoma City days. The Thunder lost in the 2012 Finals, and the slow erosion of the dynasty that never was began. Harden was traded before the next season. Three years later, Brooks was let go. Durant left as a free agent a season after that, and this past summer the team had to rebuild after trading Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers, setting in motion Westbrook\u2019s once-unthinkable departure.\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked what he would like his legacy to be as the first NBA coach to develop three MVPs, Brooks initially punted the question, interpreting it as another chance to express awe of the players. When asked again, however, Brooks took a moment to recognize how he will be intertwined in the early narratives of what should be three Hall of Fame careers.\n\n\u201cI would like people to know that they all were challenged to be great pros, and myself along with my staff helped them to build a foundation to have a great pro career,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI mean, I had them at 19 and 20. You can\u2019t imagine having them all three together now. It would be pretty special.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Though Brooks\u2019s full allegiance belongs to the Wizards, who take on the Rockets on Wednesday, he\u2019s still a big fan of Harden and Westbrook.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_klvSFLFltox6fKvSVLfcerreIQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O6U5V6H2REI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
