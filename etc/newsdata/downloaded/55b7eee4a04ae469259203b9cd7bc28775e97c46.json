Four of them, including three former U.S. intelligence officers, have been convicted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors also have brought a series of economic espionage cases related to China in recent years. More than 80 percent of all economic spying charges since 2012 have involved China. The Peng prosecution is part of a broader push to confront Chinese espionage, whether economic or traditional, officials said.\n\nThe Justice Department launches a broad initiative to crack down on Chinese economic espionage\n\n\u201cThe conduct charged in this case alleges a combination of age-old spycraft and modern technology,\u201d David Anderson, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, said in a statement. \u201cThe charges announced today provide a rare glimpse into the secret efforts of the People\u2019s Republic of China to obtain classified national security information from the United States and the battle being waged by our intelligence and law-enforcement communities to protect our people, our ideas, and our national defense.\u201d\n\nThe case was made with the help of an unnamed double agent who left SD cards containing ostensibly classified information in prearranged locations in hotels in California and Georgia. The information was cleared by the U.S. government to be transmitted to China, Anderson said. He declined to comment on the nature of the information or give more details about the double agent, identified in the criminal complaint only as the \u201cSource.\u201d The U.S. government has paid the source about $191,000 for services and expenses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe case, said John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, \u201cillustrates the seriousness of Chinese espionage efforts and the determination of the United States to thwart them.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese espionage threat is \u201cmultifaceted\u201d and is the FBI\u2019s top counterintelligence priority, said John F. Bennett, the special agent in charge of the San Francisco field office.\n\nNorthern California, which includes Silicon Valley, \u201cis a target-rich environment,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThe Chinese frequently prey upon\u201d individuals in the community, including ethnic Chinese residents, whom China \u201ctargets\u201d for recruitment, he said.\n\nPeng, a San Francisco-based tour operator, who was arrested Friday at his home in Hayward, Calif., arrived in the United States in June 2001 and was naturalized in 2012, officials said. He allegedly began his work as a courier for the MSS in June 2015 and continued through June 2018. He carried out six dead drops in that time frame, sometimes leaving money for the source, whom he never met, prosecutors said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe source would gain entry to a hotel room, sometimes telling the front-desk clerk that \u201chis friend \u2018Ed\u2019 had reserved a room for him,\u201d according to the complaint. Inside the hotel room, he would leave an SD card for Peng. Sometimes it was hidden in a cigarette pack left in a dresser; sometimes it was taped to a TV stand or a dresser drawer.\n\nOn four occasions, Peng left money for the source: cash payments of $10,000 or $20,000.\n\nThe FBI intercepted some of Peng\u2019s phone calls with his MSS handlers in Beijing and secretly videotaped Peng. A June 2018 video shows him pulling a wad of cash out of his pocket, counting the money and putting it in an envelope that he tapes to a drawer in a TV stand, officials said.\n\nPeng faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for acting as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the attorney general.\n\nAD", "description": "Xuehua \u201cEdward\u201d Peng thought he was carrying classified material to Beijing but got the material from a source working for the U.S. government.", "authors": ["Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M8H7tjcnoinVlujTjE-1Dkwb_fk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SG3AQBHDXEI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
