Korean restaurants often serve it as part of the banchan (side dish) selection, but you can also serve it as an accompaniment to grilled meats, or even by itself, as a light meal. As with many Korean dishes, there's quite a bit of prep work involved but, once all the ingredients are ready, the cooking is quick and easy.\n\nThe dangmyeon (sweet potato noodles) and Korean zucchini (which has a milder flavour and smoother, more tender skin than Italian zucchini) are sold at shops specialising in Korean ingredients, where you can also pick up packets of beef short ribs cut for Korean barbecue, and the banchan. If you can't find Korean zucchini, substitute a yellow summer squash.", "description": "Japchae (also spelled \"chapchae\") is a Korean dish that is based on slippery, resilient sweet potato noodles (sometimes mung bean noodles are used, but they\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_cooking/public/d8/images/2019/09/18/scmp_29jan15_fe_cook_1138_jonw2772_new.jpg?itok=qh6Y87rl", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
