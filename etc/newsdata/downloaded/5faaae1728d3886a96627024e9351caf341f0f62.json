'Think of a combination of Netflix and Costco'", "language": "en", "text": "Direct primary care (DPC) has become an intriguing alternative to the pricey system that is American health care.\n\n\u201cThink of a combination of Netflix and Costco,\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Gold, a family physician who sees his patients through DPC, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWith Netflix, you pay a monthly fee to have streaming movies and TV shows \u2014 maybe there\u2019s a month you watch five, maybe there\u2019s a month you watch zero, but you still pay the same fee. The only difference with direct primary care is we obviously don\u2019t have the infrastructure to carry 2 million users. So we do limit our panel size to about 600 to 1,000 patients.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cBut it\u2019s also like Costco in the sense that by being a member of the practice, you\u2019re getting discounts from anywhere from 70-85% on labs, many medications, imaging studies, and specialty visits.\u201d\n\nDr. Millie Marie Tolentino (R) examines patient Dora Leon at Clinica Sierra Vista's Central Bakersfield Community Health Center in Bakersfield, California.

This fee covers all or most primary care services including clinical and laboratory services, consultative services, care coordination, and comprehensive care management.\u201d\n\nGold is president of Gold Direct Primary Care and co-founder of the Massachusetts chapter of the Free Market Medical Association (FMMA) alongside Adam Russo of the PHIA Group. The FMMA is part of a free market movement in health care pushing for more affordable services for both doctors and patients.\n\n\u2018A Stockholm Syndrome\u2019 with the current system\n\nThe problem that direct primary care attempts to solve relate to the relationship between patients and health care providers.\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019ve devalued the relationship between a primary care doctor and the patients,\u201d Gold said. \u201cThere are a lot of factors that go into it, a lot of fault to go around. \u2026 At its core, everybody needs a relationship with a primary care doctor that can not only help prevent illness, but also be there to treat the acute problem and actually be a navigator [for] this complex labyrinth that we have a system.\u201d\n\nDirect primary care typically consists of a contract between the two, \u201cunder which the provider agrees to deliver primary care services in exchange for a monthly fee, which typically runs between $50 and $150,\u201d according to The Commonwealth Fund (TCF). Much like Netflix, it is like a subscription-based service. As a result, there is no middle man involved, solidifying the patient/doctor relationship.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a Stockholm Syndrome with the current health care system,\u201d Gold said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s resistance to change.\u201d\n\nA patient winces as he is attended to by a doctor.

According to a report from the TCF, \u201cemployer plan premium contributions and out-of-pocket costs, like those for prescription drugs, are eating up an increasing portion of household budgets.\u201d An estimated 23.6 million Americans with employer coverage had high premium contributions, high out-of-pocket costs, or both, according to the report.\n\nMuch of the issue stems from the fact that different hospitals and providers charge various amounts for the same type of service, depending on who the payer is or what their insurance plan is.
