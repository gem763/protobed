Harley Rouda Harley Edwin RoudaHere's what to watch this week on impeachment Testimony from GOP diplomat complicates Trump defense Ex-Trump aide on Russia testifies for 10 hours as part of impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Calif.), a member of the Oversight and Reform Committee, one of three House panels leading the impeachment probe.\n\nEven for a Capitol accustomed to chaos, the protest was a remarkable escalation of the partisan battle royal surrounding the impeachment investigation, pitting Democrats accusing the president of abusing his powers against Trump\u2019s Republican allies, who say the whole process is designed to sink Trump\u2019s reelection chances next year.\n\nWhere the Democrats sense high crimes and misdemeanors, Republicans smell naked politics.\n\n\u201cAll of us already know that this is a sham process that the Democrats are using for the 2020 elections. It\u2019s Russian collusion 2.0, which was a total hoax,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks Morris (Mo) Jackson BrooksGOP lawmaker blasts Omar and Tlaib: Netanyahu right to block 'enemies' of Israel Conservatives call on Pelosi to cancel August recess Overnight Defense: Woman accusing general of sexual assault willing to testify | Joint Chiefs pick warns against early Afghan withdrawal | Tensions rise after Iran tries to block British tanker MORE (R-Ala.), who participated in the sit-in. \u201cThey used it to gain House seats in the 2018 elections, and they\u2019re pulling out the same playbook in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe protest quickly triggered a wave of frustration among Democrats, who called it a political diversion to distract from damaging testimony William Taylor, a top diplomat to Ukraine, gave the committees Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is a pathetic stunt. They are storming a castle that they already occupied,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski Thomas (Tom) MalinowskiOvernight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Democrat: Top diplomat's testimony on Ukraine is 'sea change' in impeachment probe MORE (D-N.J.), a former State Department official. \u201cIt is impossible to understand this from a rational point of view other than there was devastating testimony against the president.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who took part in the \u201cstorm the SCIF\u201d group led by Trump ally Rep. Matt Gaetz Matthew (Matt) GaetzLawmakers from both sides of the aisle mourn Cummings The Hill's Morning Report - Tempers boil over at the White House Schiff says committees will eventually make impeachment inquiry transcripts public MORE (R-Fla.) did the demonstration to loudly protest the process in which Democrats have been conducting their impeachment inquiry \u2014 behind closed doors, limiting members\u2019 access to transcripts, without an impeachment vote by the full House, and without giving Republicans the power to subpoena their own witnesses.\n\n\u201cAs a member of Congress, I think I have the right to see the evidence. If we are going to vote on something that is as consequential as this is, I think every member of Congress has the right to see the evidence, and we should go where the evidence leads us,\u201d said Rep. Gary Palmer Gary James PalmerHouse passes sweeping budget, debt limit deal Palmer's Paris agreement bashing lacks policy basis Tensions rise during GOP leadership meeting over dues MORE (Ala.), a member of Republican leadership. \u201cIt is an extraordinary thing to do something like that, but there is a limit to the secrecy, there has to be.\u201d\n\nStill, some GOP staffers who are on panels overseeing the impeachment probe privately voiced concern that by violating the secure room process, Republicans were undermining their argument that Democrats were flouting the proper procedure for impeachment.\n\nAnd Democrats were quick to point out that, under House rules, the closed-door depositions are limited to members \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 of the three committees leading the investigation: Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cTheir attempt to act like Freedom Riders is really an attack on the committee system in Congress,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin Jamin (Jamie) Ben RaskinEx-Trump aide on Russia testifies for 10 hours as part of impeachment inquiry Oversight panel to subpoena Trump officials next week over deportation deferrals Democrats plow ahead as Trump seeks to hobble impeachment effort MORE (D-Md.). \u201cEssentially, they\u2019re saying that 535 members should be in that room. Obviously, they\u2019re just trying to shut it down.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe five-hour protest came to an end just after 3 p.m., shortly after the House Sergeant at Arms, Paul Irving, was seen going alone into the secure room. It doesn\u2019t appear that Republicans won any concessions, however, and some GOP lawmakers are already suggesting they\u2019ll protest future depositions if Republicans aren\u2019t granted more powers.\n\n\u201cI would imagine that things will get worse, not better, if the process doesn\u2019t improve,\u201d said Rep. Lee Zeldin Lee ZeldinTrump embarks on Twitter spree amid impeachment inquiry, Syria outrage Graham huddles with House Republicans on impeachment strategy State Dept. official told to lay low after voicing concerns about Giuliani: Dem lawmaker MORE (R-N.Y.), a Trump defender who has loudly criticized the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed Cooper for her testimony after the Department of Defense sought to direct her not to appear for her scheduled deposition and in order to prevent the Pentagon from seeking to limit her closed-door testimony, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats hope Cooper, who has worked in the federal government for almost two decades, can shed light on any role the Pentagon played in withholding aid to Ukraine.\n\nHer testimony comes a day after Taylor offered what Democrats described as some of the most damaging testimony yet \u2014 in which the top diplomatic official to Ukraine linked the administration\u2019s decision to withhold roughly $400 million in aid to demands for politically motivated investigations.\n\nRepublicans have sought to downplay Taylor\u2019s testimony, saying he relayed mostly secondhand information as it related to an alleged quid pro quo. They also have argued that there could not be a quid pro quo if Kiev was not aware that the aid was withheld.\n\n\u201cName me one thing that Ukraine did to release the money. Nothing,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyThe Memo: Trump 'lynching' firestorm is sign of things to come McConnell: Trump lynching comment 'an unfortunate choice of words' White House spokesman: Trump didn't mean to compare his experience with 'darkest moments' in US history MORE (R-Calif.) said. \u201cTo have a quid pro quo, you have to exchange one side for another thing.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, however, say that while the quid pro quo is important, they believe the president asking Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 presidential election is enough.\n\n\u201cA quid pro quo is not required,\u201d said Rep. Stephen Lynch Stephen Francis LynchThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Diplomat's 'powerful' testimony and 'lynching' attract headlines Overnight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Democrats say they have game changer on impeachment MORE (D-Mass.), who says he \u201cdefinitely\u201d believes there was one. \u201cHowever, merely soliciting a foreign government to do a political hit job on your political opponent in a U.S. election is a violation of [the law]. So, quid pro quo is really a canard. That is a straw man.
