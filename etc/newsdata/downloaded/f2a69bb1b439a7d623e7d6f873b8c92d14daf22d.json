China also said on Monday that it was filing a complaint at the World Trade Organisation over Mr Trump\u2019s new tariffs.\n\nMarkets sank on weaker economic news and worries about the trade war. The S&P 500 was down about 0.9 per cent, with particular weakness in industrial and energy stocks.\n\nPrices of key industrial commodities were also lower, with futures prices for benchmark American crude oil down roughly 3 per cent.\n\nCopper, considered a barometer of the health of the global industrial sector, was down a bit less than 1 per cent.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

And he said any business that complained about financial pain from the tariffs was suffering from bad management, not the trade war.\n\nOn Tuesday, he warned Beijing not to try to wait for a new administration to come into office after the 2020 election, saying that China\u2019s supply chain \u201cwill crumble\u201d and that it would be \u201ca long time to be haemorrhaging jobs and companies on a long-shot\u201d.\n\nMany chief executives and trade groups say they support the president\u2019s goal of changing China\u2019s economic practices, particularly those that require businesses to hand over valuable technology as a condition of operating in China.\n\nBut businesses have begun to express concern about the seemingly unending trade war.\n\nMany big companies, particularly those in the retail and manufacturing sectors, have downgraded sales and profit forecasts as a result of the tariffs.\n\nThe trade war\u2019s potential to slow America\u2019s economic expansion, including its impact on the manufacturing sector, has already prompted concern from Federal Reserve officials.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut rates for the first time in more than a decade in July and officials have said they are prepared to cut further to protect the economy against fallout from slowing global growth and trade risks.\n\nEven some officials who did not vote in favour of July\u2019s rate cut say economic risks have increased.\n\nEric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a monetary policy voter this year, indicated that he still favours waiting and watching incoming economic data before making interest rate cuts beyond the July move, which he voted against.\n\nBut he also said it is \u201cclearly reasonable\u201d to judge that risks to the economy are elevated, and \u201cshould those risks become a reality, the appropriate monetary policy would be to ease aggressively\u201d, suggesting that he might favour rapid interest rate cuts if economic data soured meaningfully.\n\nThe Trump administration has been pressuring China for more than two years to make a trade deal that would strengthen its protections for American intellectual property and result in large purchases of American products.\n\nBut the two sides continue to have significant disagreements, including which of Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs should be rolled back and what kind of legal changes China must make to treat American companies more fairly.\n\nSince talks between the two countries stalled in May, Mr Trump has moved ahead with his threat to tax nearly everything China sends to the United States.\n\nOn Sunday, the Trump administration placed a 15 per cent levy on roughly $112 (\u00a392.1) billion worth of Chinese goods and plans to place tariffs on roughly $160 (\u00a3131.7) billion worth of cellphones, laptops, clothing and toys on 15 December.\n\nThe US president has also said the United States will raise tariffs on $250 (\u00a3205.7) billion worth of products to 30 per cent from 25 per cent on 1 October.\n\nChina has vowed to retaliate on 15 December with more tariffs of its own.\n\nWhile a deal appears far from certain, the two sides could still avert the increases and declare another ceasefire.\n\nThe United States and China have discussed a meeting in Washington in September, and American and Chinese officials will both be present on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York later in the month.\n\nMyron Brilliant, the executive vice president of the US Chamber of Commerce, said the two governments would have to work to restore some trust before any conclusion to the trade war would be reached \u2014 perhaps through Chinese purchases of American agricultural goods, something Mr Trump has long focused on.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trust deficit between the two governments,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need steppingstones to build confidence in the relationship so both governments are positioned to get a deal down the road.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Donald Trump said on Tuesday\u00a0that Chinese manufacturing would \u201ccrumble\u201d if the country did not agree to the United States\u2019 trade terms.\u00a0 His comments come as newly released data shows his trade war was washing back to American shores and hurting the factories that the president has aimed to protect.", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/10/donald-trump.jpg"}
