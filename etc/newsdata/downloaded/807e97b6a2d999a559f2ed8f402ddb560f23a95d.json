Very magnanimous!\n\nThat one post has already racked up over 4.5 million likes and has netted her account a cool 2.2 million followers, all in the space of seven hours.\n\nHer former partner Justin Theroux has also weighed in on her arrival on the platform, offering a dignified and considered welcome:\n\nAniston also happened to tag each of her new mates in the pic, which appears to have boosted the follower counts of flannel enthusiast Matt LeBlanc, potential beer thief David Schwimmer, anti-bullying campaigner Lisa Kudrow, and amateur furniture removalist Courtney Cox.\n\nUnfortunately we have no way to tell who the fifth person is, but we\u2019ll keep you posted.\n\nActually, hold up, just came across this: PEOPLE states Aniston was in a short-lived sitcom called Friends in the 90s, and these folks appeared as extras or something.\n\nApparently this is the first time the gang has been photographed together since the show\u2019s quiet demise in 2004. Speaking to the outlet, Aniston said they reunited at Cox\u2019s house last month to share some fond memories of the show.\n\nBless them. Good thing they have memories of the show, because we certainly don\u2019t.\n\nREAD MORE The Couch From 'Friends' Is Touring Australia So You Better Pivot Outta My Way", "description": "The actor was apparently in a sitcom in the 90s, which seems to have been pretty popular,", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/aniston-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
