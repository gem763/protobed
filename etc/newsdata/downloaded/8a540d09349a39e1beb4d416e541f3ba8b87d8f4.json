We sincerely apologize to Stephanie Apstein, Sports Illustrated and to all individuals who witnessed this incident or were offended by the inappropriate conduct. The Astros in no way intended to minimize the issues related to domestic violence.\n\n\u201cOur initial belief was based on witness statements about the incident. Subsequent interviews have revealed that Taubman\u2019s inappropriate comments were, in fact, directed toward one or more reporters. Accordingly, we have terminated Brandon Taubman\u2019s employment with the Houston Astros. His conduct does not reflect the values of our organization and we believe this is the most appropriate course of action.\u2019\u2019\n\nTaubman, celebrating the Astros\u2019 American League pennant-clinching Game 6 last Saturday, yelled about six times toward three female reporters in the clubhouse: \u201cThank God we got (Roberto) Osuna! I\u2019m so (expletive) glad we got Osuna!\u201d\n\nAPOLOGY: Astros respond to report of executive taunting female reporters\n\nARMOUR: Astros' non-apology another sign of their unchecked arrogance\n\nOsuna, the Astros\u2019 closer, was acquired in July, 2018, while he was serving a 75-game suspension for violating Major League Baseball\u2019s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse policy. Osuna, who was arrested in Toronto for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, and the mother of their 3-year-old son, accepted his suspension without appeal. The charges were withdrawn last September when Osuna entered into a peace bond in Canadian court.\n\nTaubman originally denied any intent.\n\nHe issued a statement that read: \u201cI used inappropriate language for which I am deeply sorry and embarrassed. In retrospect, I realize that my comments were unprofessional and inappropriate. My overexuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue.\u201d\n\nYet, the investigation led by MLB determined he was lying.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to Major League Baseball and to everyone that cooperated in the investigation, the Astros said in the statement. \u201c As previously stated, the Astros are very committed to using our voice to create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence. We fully support MLB and baseball\u2019s stance and values regarding domestic violence. We will continue to make this cause a priority for our organization. \u2018\u2019\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "The Astros fired assistant GM Brandon Taubman after discovering he lied to them about his expletive-filled tirade toward a group of female reporters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/24/USAT/f35ef245-bc91-4f3e-a44e-c6638692ab4d-AP_MLB-Astros_Investigation_Baseball.JPG?crop=1236,1647,x779,y0&width=1236&height=1378&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
