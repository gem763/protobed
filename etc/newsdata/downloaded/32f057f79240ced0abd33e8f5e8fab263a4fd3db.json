An official call for new consultation has not halted confrontation. A recognition of legitimate public grievances did not produce any specific ideas for how to resolve them.\n\nIn brief, the sometimes-violent troubles in Hong Kong persist and\u2014despite a surprising and long overdue official attempt to calm things down\u2014there is no end in sight to mass demonstrations against the policies of both the local government and the national regime in Beijing. Instead, protesters continue to demand that the Hong Kong administration, headed by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, drop charges against some 1,100 arrested demonstrators, stop calling them rioters, hold an independent investigation into alleged police brutality and initiate political reforms leading to election of Lam\u2019s successor and all local legislators by universal suffrage.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that some of these eventually will be granted, but nothing is certain.\n\nThe basic reason is simple; agreeing to them is beyond the power of Lam and her beleaguered administration. Her government can only offer terms authorized by Chinese president and Communist Party chief Xi Jinping, and he has shown no interest in compromising with any form of political dissent anywhere in China.

Or as a party official put it more colorfully, quoting a poem by Mao Zedong, critical Western diplomats are like \u201cflies that moan and cry after hitting the wall.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Hong Kong may remain a busy business city but its self-proclaimed future as \u201cAsia\u2019s Global City\u201d seems bleak.", "authors": ["Robert Keatley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r8Rj9v63sC93ajh4.orzCQ--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/1b3f25897e36e5321afc6c86acd6ba5f", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
