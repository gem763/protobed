The U.S. president also called on all countries to act to counter Iran\u2019s regime, which Washington has placed sanctions on.\n\nNews reports of the impeachment inquiry were blamed for putting the pressure on stocks late in Tuesday\u2019s session, providing some lift to bonds and gold.\n\nSo far this week, political developments in the U.S., along with continuing tensions in the Middle East between Iran and Saudi Arabia, as well as persistent China-U.S. tariff conflicts and worries about slowing global economic growth, all have helped to support gold prices, commodity experts said.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment dust over in the US, escalating tensions between the US and China after Trump\u2019s speech, and targeting Iran as a major culprit of the recent incidents which happened over in Saudi Arabia, all of this have all supported the recent move in the gold price.\u201d wrote Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, in a Wednesday research note.\n\nAnalysts said the impeachment inquiry is a potential drag for stocks, though the potential may be limited barring an indication that support for Trump is slipping in the Republican-controlled Senate. A vote by the House to impeach would be followed by a trial in the Senate, which would decide the president\u2019s fate but appears unlikely given that a GOP majority there.\n\n\u201cThe upward momentum still looks fairly strong and this means that it is only a matter of time before the price breaks above the $1550 mark,\u201d Aslam wrote.\n\nTrump on Tuesday said a transcript of one of his phone conversations with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky would be declassified and submitted for public consumption sometime Wednesday.", "description": "Gold prices pull back Wednesday morning, a day after assets perceived as havens attracted bullish bids following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GD012_platin_ZG_20180203120802.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
