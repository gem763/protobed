The captain, Terry Graham, had asked her to come into the cockpit so that he could use the lavatory. Southwest Airlines protocol requires a second person in the cockpit at all times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSteinaker saw the pilot in the streaming video on the iPad mounted on the windshield left of the flight captain\u2019s seat, according to the lawsuit. The complaint said co-pilot Ryan Russell admitted to Steinaker that the iPad was streaming from a camera in the lavatory, but tried to convince her that the cameras were a \u201ctop-secret security measure installed in all of Southwest\u2019s Boeing 737-800 planes.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Steinaker and passengers, including young children had used the forward lavatory. Both pilots are still flying for Southwest, the complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit was originally filed in an Arizona state court in October 2018 on behalf of Renee Steinaker and her husband, David Steinaker, also a Southwest flight attendant. In late August, it was moved to federal court in Phoenix. The Steinakers live in the Phoenix area.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRonald L.M. Goldman, an attorney for the couple, said the alleged live-streaming compromised safety.\n\n\u201cThe cockpit of a commercial airliner is not a playground for peeping Toms. Behavior that distracts and distresses crew members during flight compromises safety,\u201d Goldman said in a statement.\n\nThe Steinakers\u2019 attorneys say the flight attendant has risked her career by making the incident public and has been subject to retaliation by Southwest. The attorney also said the three other flight attendants on Flight 1088, and Steinaker\u2019s husband, who wasn\u2019t on that flight, have faced harassment and been subjected to more than the usual performance audits and drug tests.\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked Sunday about the employment status of the pilots and the allegations of retaliation, Southwest Airlines declined to comment. \u201cAt this time, we have no other comment on the pending litigation,\u201d the airline said.\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit claims Steinaker was physically distressed and unable to work for several days after the incident, and continues to have \u201cphysical, emotional, and mental injuries as a result of the incident.\u201d\n\nCourt filings by attorneys for Dallas-based Southwest and the two pilots denied the live-streaming allegations, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn its statement, Southwest said when the incident happened, the airline investigated the allegations and addressed the situation with the crew involved.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm from our investigation that there was never a camera in the lavatory; the incident was an inappropriate attempt at humor which the company did not condone,\u201d the airline said.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe safety and security of our Employees and Customers is Southwest\u2019s uncompromising priority. As such, Southwest does not place cameras in the lavatories of our aircraft.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The lawsuit was filed by a flight attendant on the flight.
