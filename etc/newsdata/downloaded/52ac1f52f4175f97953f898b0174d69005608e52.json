This prompted the majority of the table\u2014including former Fox News host Abby Huntsman\u2014to lament the lack of action on behalf of the Republican-led Senate to address gun violence.\n\n\u201cIf nothing is going to happen after Sandy Hook, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to take,\u201d Huntsman sighed.\n\nMoments later, McCain weighed in as the \u201cchick on the panel that spent most of her break shooting.\u201d\n\nStating that there need to be more reporters in mainstream media on the \u201cgun beat\u201d because there are a lot of people on TV \u201ctalking about guns that clearly have never shot a gun,\u201d McCain complained about Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal for a mandatory gun buyback.\n\n\u201cI will say this is a ground-level issue for me,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a gun-grabber, you don\u2019t get my vote, period. We got to have a different conversation.\u201d\n\nLiberal co-host Joy Behar\u2014a regular sparring partner of McCain\u2019s\u2014pointed out that there have been gun restrictions passed by previous Democratic administrations, specifically noting that the Clinton White House passed an assault-weapons ban.\n\n\u201cThe AR-15 is by far the most popular gun in America, by far,\u201d McCain declared. \u201cI was just in the middle of Wyoming, if you're talking about taking people\u2019s guns from them, there\u2019s going to be a lot of violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they lived without them for many years during the ban,\u201d Behar retorted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not living without guns,\u201d McCain exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple!\u201d\n\nHostin, meanwhile, asked if she could live without assault weapons, causing McCain to reiterate that the AR-15 was very popular before complaining that she was being \u201cvirtue signaled.\u201d\n\nHuntsman, however, responded to her close friend, wondering if they could live in an America where you could \u201cwalk in a mall and not be nervous that someone is going to pull out a shotgun.\u201d\n\nMcCain asserted that she felt safe because she could protect herself because \u201cI have guns at my house\u201d before stopping herself short as she felt the audience wasn\u2019t with her.\n\n\u201cAll right, welcome back,\u201d she sarcastically muttered, sipping from her coffee mug.\n\nAs the segment came to a close, McCain would pipe up once again about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gun buyback proposal, insisting that her guns are \u201cnot for sale.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
