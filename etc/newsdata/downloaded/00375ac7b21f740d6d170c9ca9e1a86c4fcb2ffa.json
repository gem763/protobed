Mr Pompeo said the US evidence was \u201cunmistakable\u201d and said \u201cthe world needs to unite\u201d during appearances on American news shows on Sunday.\n\nHe said further US military deployment to the region was one of the options Mr Trump may consider to keep oil tankers moving through the area.\n\nHowever, several European foreign ministers have said they are unconvinced by the US allegations and called for an independent UN investigation.\n\nHeiko Maas, the German foreign minister, said the EU states \u201ccontinue to gather information\u201d while Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok said the Netherlands was \u201cinterested in any clarifications that can be made available\u201d\n\n3 What has Iran said in response?\n\nIran has denied being involved in the attacks and accused the US of promoting an \u201cIranophobic\u201d campaign.\n\nHowever, Tehran has previously used mines against oil tankers in 1987 and 1988 in the \u201cTanker War\u201d, during which the US Navy escorted ships through the region.\n\nTensions have been further stoked since US President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year.\n\nUnder the deal, Tehran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium for the lifting of crippling sanctions, but has now threatened to resume enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels if European nations do not renew the deal by 7 July.", "description": "Tensions in the Middle East are on the rise once again after Donald Trump\u2018s administration blamed Iran for attacks on several oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, a vital oil shipping lane.
