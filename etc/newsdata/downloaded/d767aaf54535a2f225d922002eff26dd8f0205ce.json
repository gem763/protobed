He engenders respect and admiration, but generates little excitement.\n\nOne elderly man sitting in the back of the room fell asleep as the former vice president shared his vision for America\u2019s future in unusually hushed tones for nearly 45 minutes without taking questions.\n\nAfterward, David Metz, a member of the county Democratic committee, said that despite a campaign season that has already featured millions of dollars spent, countless miles logged and four debates staged, there is a deepening feeling of indecision among local voters who now have less than 100 days to finalize their 2020 pick.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what to do,\u201d Metz said. \u201cThey\u2019re all afraid. There\u2019s a lot of anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn almost every campaign cycle, there comes a phase of indifference, fear and difficult questions. But in the 2020 cycle, Democratic officials hoped that the fervent desire to beat Trump would eventually lead to an enthusiastic embrace of its presidential field.\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm for Biden\u2019s candidacy underscores a broader trend emerging in the states that matter most in the Democratic Party\u2019s high-stakes presidential nomination fight: Primary voters appear to be getting less certain of their choice as Election Day approaches.\n\nThe historically large field, while in part of measure of the desire to oust the incumbent president, has also made it harder for the top contenders to forge a more focused contest. Nine Democrats so far have qualified for the party\u2019s November debate and a dozen more are still fighting for attention. Among the top tier, the liabilities of Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, in particular \u2014 are becoming more visible as Iowa\u2019s Feb. 3 caucuses approach.\n\nMajor donors and party leaders across the country have publicly and privately raised concerns about the direction of the primary election recently as well. But interviews with dozens of primary voters across Iowa and New Hampshire in recent days reveal a pervasive feeling of unease.\n\nPolling suggests that the number of undecided voters in Iowa has jumped significantly in recent weeks. And even among those who have a favorite candidate, most say they could change their mind before voting begins.\n\nTom Steyer, a billionaire progressive activist, is among those lower-tier candidates aggressively fighting to capitalize on the uncertainty. He\u2019s vowed to spend at least $100 million of his own money in the campaign, although he acknowledged in a weekend interview that his investment could shift up or down depending on conditions on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re three months out from Iowa and we thought that there would be a lot of indecision, but it\u2019s definitely higher than we would have expected. No question,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cThat is something that has to be true if I\u2019m going to win. And it is true.\u201d\n\nJust ask the voters.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Greg Bruss, a 68-year-old retired teacher, says he\u2019s usually volunteering for a candidate by this time in the primary cycle. That\u2019s not the case this year as he mulls voting for either Sanders or Warren.\n\n\u201cThe times are that much more dire,\u201d Bruss said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get it wrong.\u201d\n\nFormer New Hampshire state Sen. Bette Lasky says she\u2019s impressed with the Democratic field, but she\u2019s remained on the sidelines as well, even after hosting house parties for several candidates.\n\n\u201cGenerally, I don\u2019t have trouble making up my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cBut (it\u2019s) difficult for me to get out there behind any one candidate.\u201d\n\nBack in Iowa, 43-year-old Waterloo school employee Danielle Borglum said she expected to finalize her decision after watching the last debate, but she couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize the amount of people that we had as candidates!\u201d Borglum said. \u201cSo many people have a plan. Is anyone really right?\u201d\n\nBev Alderson, a 59-year-old retired teacher from Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, said she has \u201ca couple of frontrunners, but they\u2019re not etched in stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much to be said yet. There\u2019s too many things that are happening and going on, it\u2019s just too early,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile significant, history suggests that the uncertainty currently defining the 2020 primary season is not totally unique.\n\nBefore Iowa\u2019s 2004 contest, for example, former House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman and Vermont Gov. Howard Dean all led the polls at times before then-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry made a late surge to win.\n\nAnd three months before Iowa\u2019s 2008 Democratic caucuses, most polls had Hillary Clinton with a significant lead over John Edwards and a little-known Illinois senator named Barack Obama. Obama, of course, went on to win the Iowa caucuses by almost 8 points and Clinton finished third.\n\nThat history, backed by polling that shows most voters could still change their minds, is convincing low-polling underdog candidates to keep fighting.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned by listening to the people of Iowa is they tend to make up their minds fairly close to caucus night,\u201d former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke told reporters during a forum in Des Moines last week.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who hasn\u2019t topped 2% in any Iowa poll since June, said he was encouraged by a crowd of 200 that showed up to see him speak the night before. He said he\u2019s getting a clear message from voters who say, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m excited about you \u2014 you\u2019re first on my list, or you\u2019ve moved up from four to two,\u2019 which I\u2019m learning is really important in the Iowa caucuses.\u201d\n\nAnd former Housing Secretary Julian Castro warned supporters last week that he\u2019d need to raise $800,000 by the end of the month to keep his campaign alive. But he, too, seized on the large number of undecideds.\n\nThe primary campaign, Castro said, is \u201cmore unstable than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of people in these polls that, even though they express a preference for one candidate or another, are saying that they can still change their mind,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThree months is probably 10 lifetimes in politics.\u201d\n\nJennifer Konfrst, a first-term Iowa state senator, agrees.\n\nShe\u2019s supporting Booker, but she says many of her friends have already changed their minds about which candidate they like best.\n\n\u201cSo many of my friends have three top choices \u2014 and they\u2019re not the same three,\u201d she said. \u201cAnybody who says they know what\u2019s going to happen is lying.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWoodall reported from Manchester, New Hampshire.", "description": "MUSCATINE, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Look no further than Pearl City Station, a plain brick building set along the banks of the Mississippi River, to understand the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/27/736f0a_election-2020-elizabeth-warren-90623-elizabeth-warren-in-oct-24-2019-file-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
