Other forms, such as betting on animal races, sporting matches and other cultural events, are allowed through verificaed vendors such as TAB and Sportsbet. In order to access those sites, however, you need to prove you're the legal age, 18, or over.\n\nTo open a TAB account, for example, you'll require an Australian Driver Licence, a passport, a Citizenship Certificate or another form of official identifcation. Similarly with Sportsbet, you'll need to fill out a form and provide scans of multiple forms of official ID.\n\nThat's what's going to be looked into to see if it can be applied to the viewing of sexually graphic content.\n\nIn the UK, age verification laws for pornography have been considered for years and were finally put into law with the Digital Economy Act which was due to come into effect from July 2019.\n\nIt's facing delays due to the enormity of its implementation but essentially, the British Board of Film Classification will be responsible for ensuring websites hosting explicit adult content have a G-rated static page until the user verifies their age. Website are allowed to determine how they verify ages from a number of methods, which all require some form of identification or a mobile phone number. Reddit, Twitter and Imgur are excluded from the act when it finally comes into effect.\n\nSubmissions can be made to the inquiry until October 25.
