The arena that hosted the event has withdrawn its request, but the city maintains that the cost of services provided for campaign events should come from Mr Trump\u2019s campaign chest and not city coffers.\n\nMinneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said that the city\u2019s taxpayers \u201cshould not have to bear the brunt of operating costs resulting from the president\u2019s visit\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a series of unpaid invoices, some as much as three years old, well before Mr Trump was elected president in 2016.\n\nIn June, the Center for Public Integrity reported Mr Trump owed more than $840,000 from invoices across the US, not including the latest bill from Minneapolis. CNN found that six of those cities still are waiting for checks.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s largest invoice came from El Paso, where a February rally cost $470,417.\n\nAmong Mr Trump\u2019s outstanding bills were a $65,124 tab from Spokane, Washington in May 2016 and a $47,398 bill from a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in April 2016, both several months before the election.\n\nWhile in office, Mr Trump racked up unpaid bills in Mesa, Arizona; Lebanon, Ohio; and Burlington, Vermont, for a total of $89,122.\n\nCNN found that four other cities in the Centre for Public Integrity\u2019s report did not have any owed balances.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to determine who actually is liable for the cost of police and security to accommodate the large crowds and traffic for Mr Trump and his motorcade. There rarely are contracts or agreements between the campaign and municipal governments, which ultimately determine whether to dispatch the additional services, despite Secret Service details requiring them.\n\nA representative from one city told CNN that the city does not typically bill for city services provided to campaign events. Another city representative said they do send invoices but they also don\u2019t expect they\u2019ll actually be paid.\n\nThe Centre for Public Integrity argues that the Trump campaign could be flouting federal campaign finance laws for failing to address it debts owed to local governments. Law states that political committees \u201cshall report a disputed debt \u2026 if the creditor has provided something of value to the political committee\u201d.\n\nIn its mandatory reports to the Federal Election Commission, the Trump campaign did not disclose actual debts or \u201cdisputed debts\u201d to cities or their police departments.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump rally: Man charged with repeatedly punching protester in face\n\nRepublican congressman tells president to stop 'send her back' chants\n\nFirefighters blast Trump for lying about crowd sizes\n\nCrowd sings 'Amazing Grace' after woman collapses at Trump rally", "description": "As Donald Trump prepares for a rally in Louisiana ahead of the state\u2019s gubernatorial election, the president is reportedly on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in local security costs in at least six other cities where his campaign has held rallies and events.This week, the campaign threatened", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EOESc5gElygHX6FFDV7v2g--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/79d50d2c44f5c742d499646b75cafd19", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
