REUTERS/ Stephen Lam\n\nPolitico reported the settlement is expected to be between $150 million and $200 million. The settlement is set to be announced next week and will be the largest ever fine imposed for violating the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule by collecting personal information from kids without parental consent.\n\nGoogle declined to comment.\n\nThe FTC voted 3-2 to approve the settlement and sent it to the Justice Department as part of the review process, Reuters confirmed, citing a person familiar with the matter. The Washington Post reported the settlement\u2019s approval in July but did not detail the amount of the civil penalty.\n\nThe settlement will far surpass the previous record set in February, a $5.7 million civil penalty imposed on Musical.ly, which did not ask for users\u2019 ages for three years. The online library for Musical.ly \u2013 now known as TikTok \u2013 features music popular with kids.\n\nSenator Ed Markey, a Democrat, said Friday \u201cthe FTC appears to have let YouTube off the hook with a nominal fine for violating users\u2019 privacy online. And in this case, Google\u2019s intrusions on kids\u2019 personal info are at issue. We must come down hard on companies that infringe on children\u2019s privacy.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Google launched YouTubeKids. The company said it built the site \u201cto create a safer environment for kids to explore their interests and curiosity, while giving parents the tools to customize the experience for their kids.\u201d\n\nParents can select from three different age groups to choose age-appropriate content - preschool, ages 5-7 and 8-12.\n\nKatharina Kopp, deputy director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said Friday \u201ca settlement amount of $150-200 million would be woefully low, considering the egregious nature of the violation, how much Google profited from violating the law, and given Google\u2019s size and revenue.\u201d\n\nShe added the fine \u201cwould effectively reward Google for engaging in massive and illegal data collection.\u201d\n\nIn April 2018, the center, joined by other groups, filed an FTC complaint alleging YouTube profited from kids \u201cwithout first providing direct notice to parents and obtaining their consent as required by law. Google uses this information to target advertisements to children across the internet and across devices.\u201d", "description": "Alphabet Inc's Google will spend up to $200 million to settle a Federal Trade Commission investigation into YouTube's alleged violation of a children's privacy law, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190831&t=2&i=1424603076&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T1I2-OCATC"}
