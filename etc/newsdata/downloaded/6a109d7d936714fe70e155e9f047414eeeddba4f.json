He was limited to two games due to an Achilles injury as a rookie and didn't ascend to stardom in either of the next two seasons.\n\nBen Standig of The Athletic reported Washington \"lost faith\" in Doctson and was looking to trade him before the beginning of the season. The team already declined its fifth-year option on the TCU product, making him a free agent next offseason.\n\nDespite Washington giving up on him, Doctson still has fans in the locker room.\n\n\"He goes after the ball like no other. I'm talking about a jump ball,\" cornerback Josh Norman said, per John Keim of ESPN. \"He has his strengths and abilities to where he can be one of the top guys in this league if he wants it. ... We have had a couple quarterback changes since he's been here. You have to take that into consideration.\"\n\nThe Vikings will be responsible for Doctson developing into a more consistent playmaker. At age 26 without much history of NFL success, it's unclear if Doctson will carve out a big role in Minnesota, but he could at least replace fellow 2016 first-round bust Laquon Treadwell, who was released last week.\n\nWithout much depth at receiver behind Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, he's worth a one-year contract to potentially provide the Vikings with another option in the passing attack.", "description": "The  Minnesota Vikings  and wide receiver  Josh  Doctson   agreed to a one-year contract Monday, per   Tom  Pelissero   of NFL Network.
