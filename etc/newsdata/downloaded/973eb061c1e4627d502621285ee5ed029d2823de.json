I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d the 16-year-old Swede said while appearing to fight back tears.\n\n\u201cPeople are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cPeople are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.

But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you,\u201d the teenager said before being interrupted by applause. \u201cWe will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nLUDOVIC MARIN via Getty Images Thunberg was met with applause when she warned world leaders, \"If you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who is in New York to headline a religious liberty event, unexpectedly attended a few minutes of Monday morning\u2019s event after his administration initially said he would skip it. He listened to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with whom he\u2019d attended a rally in Houston on Sunday, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel before leaving.\n\nThunberg said last month that she had no plans to try to talk with Trump while in the U.S. \u201cWhy should I waste time talking to him when he, of course, is not going to listen to me?\u201d she told CBS News. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything that he hasn\u2019t already heard.\u201d", "description": "\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\" the 16-year-old told the United Nations gathering.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88ec792100005b00eb2f35.jpeg?cache=gvutjksctb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
