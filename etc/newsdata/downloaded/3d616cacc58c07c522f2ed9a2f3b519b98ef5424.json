(Rob Carr/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Donald Trump was booed loudly and met with a chant of \u201clock him up\u201d Sunday night when he was announced as a special guest at World Series Game 5 at Nationals Park.\n\nThe 45th U.S. president arrived during the first inning as the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals battled to take the series lead. Trump\u2019s arrival was not shown or mentioned on the Fox broadcast. His presence was acknowledged by broadcaster Joe Buck just before the third inning.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBefore the fourth inning, however, Trump was greeted by the Nationals\u2019 public address announcer and shown on the stadium\u2019s video screen. The response from the crowd was to boo the president and chant \u201clock him up.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump was just introduced at Nationals Park during Game 5 of the World Series.\n\n\n\nLots of boos. pic.twitter.com/xSvZJcTpYH \u2014 Chase Hughes (@ChaseHughesNBCS) October 28, 2019\n\nPresident Trump was booed loudly by the fans at Nats Park when he was shown on the big screen.\n\nThen came a loud chant: \u201cLock him up.\u201d @wusa9 pic.twitter.com/LBbgSAHd6k \u2014 Adam Longo (@adamlongoTV) October 28, 2019\n\nA presidential appearance at the World Series is nothing new, but in the age of social media and our currently divided political spectrum, a Trump visit wasn\u2019t so simple as a celebrity coming to a game. It was as much a political event as it was a sports happening.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s a point that was proven later in the game when an \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d banner was hung by fans in right field. It was quickly confiscated, according to reports from the scene.\n\nImpeach Trump banner up in RF now too. pic.twitter.com/DM9tNxO568 \u2014 Henry Coppola (@hcoppola) October 28, 2019\n\nMLB commissioner Rob Manfred said Trump opted out of throwing the first pitch to \u201cimprove fan experience.\u201d Trump also joked he\u2019d need to wear body armor on to the field. He may have also been trying to avoid just that type of reaction from fans at the World Series.\n\nHere are more pictures from Trump\u2019s World Series visit:\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump has arrived at Nationals Park.
