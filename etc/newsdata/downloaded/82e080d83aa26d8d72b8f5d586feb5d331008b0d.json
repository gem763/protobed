Joe Raedle, a photographer for Getty, recently flew to Kivalina to spend some time with the villagers and photograph their lives and surroundings. The warming climate has led to troubles such as the accelerated erosion of the land the village sits on, which used to be mitigated by sea ice (which is vanishing), and permafrost (which is melting). Fish and wildlife that villagers rely on for food have been forced to change their migration patterns\u2014and poor hunting means more food must be bought from a store, further increasing the cost of living. Raedle: \u201cThe residents of Kivalina are hoping to stay on their ancestral lands, where they can preserve their culture, rather than dispersing due to their island being swallowed by the rising waters of the ocean.\u201d", "description": "The small village of Kivalina is threatened on several fronts by a warming Arctic climate, as the ground it sits on erodes, and the animals the villagers rely on become more difficult to hunt.", "authors": ["Alan Taylor"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2019/09/alaska/k01_1175058045-1/facebook.jpg?1568826718"}
