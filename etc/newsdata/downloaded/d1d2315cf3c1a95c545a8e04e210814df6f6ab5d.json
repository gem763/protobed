Ralph Abraham (R-LA) has introduced a concise resolution that calls for removing Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) from the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cResolved, That pursuant to Article I, Section 5, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, Representative Nancy Pelosi, be, and she hereby is, expelled from the House of Representatives and the Office of the Speaker is declared to be vacant,\u201d the brief resolution declares.\n\nToday I introduced a resolution to expel Nancy Pelosi from the House of Representatives. This witch hunt has to end. https://t.co/2hfvkG711V \u2014 Rep. Ralph Abraham (@RepAbraham) October 8, 2019\n\nThe portion the Constitution that the resolution invokes states that, \u201cEach House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\u201d\n\nIn a press release about his resolution Rep. Abraham blasted Speaker Pelosi:\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi's vicious crusade against our lawfully-elected President is nothing more than a politically-motivated witch hunt and it must be stopped. She has disgraced the people's House and weaponized the Speaker's gavel for her party\u2019s political gain,\u201d said Abraham. \u201cHouse Democrats spent nearly three years obsessed with election meddling only to dwarf any such efforts with their own deceitful plan to nullify the 2016 election and prevent President Trump from winning in 2020. I have introduced a resolution calling for her to be expelled from the House and for the Speaker's Office to be vacated.\u201d\n\nToday the Congressman tweeted his approval of the Trump administration\u2019s decision not to cooperate with the \u201c\u2018impeachment inquiry.\u2019\u201d\n\nI support @realDonaldTrump\u2019s refusal to comply with Nancy Pelosi's illegal and unconstitutional \"impeachment inquiry.\" She has ignored all established norms and procedures in an attempt to nullify the 2016 election. My resolution would expel her from the House. #SheHasToGo pic.twitter.com/jteetrJigU \u2014 Rep.
