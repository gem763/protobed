It must now be formally approved by the bloc and ratified by the European and the British Parliament, which could be easier said than done. The U.K. parliament has already rejected a previous deal three times, votes which eventually cost previous Prime Minister Theresa May her job.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said in response that Johnson appears to have \"negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May's, which was overwhelmingly rejected.\"\n\nBORIS JOHNSON TELLS THE UN BREXIT IS LIKE HAVING ONE'S LIVER PECKED OUT BY AN EAGLE FOR ALL ETERNITY\n\n\"These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers' rights, and opening up on our NHS to a takeover by U.S. private corporations,\" Corbyn continued. \"This sell-out deal won't bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\"\n\nFollowing months of uneasiness over the prolonged Brexit process, European leaders have sounded upbeat this week. French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that he wanted \"to believe that a deal is being finalized,\" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said negotiations were \"in the final stretch.\"\n\nWhen the news went public, the pound hit a five-month high upon the U.S. dollar.\n\nJohnson \u2014 who took office in July with the promise Britain would finally leave the EU on Oct. 31 \u2014 has likened Brexit to climbing Mount Everest.\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nJohnson will need all the support he can get to push any deal through Parliament. Technical negotiators have struggled to settle on customs and sales tax regulations that will have to manage trade in goods between Northern Ireland and Ireland \u2014 where the U.K. and the E.U. share their only land border.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, Johnson's allies in government, have already signaled they could not back the outline deal.\n\nArlene Foster, leader of the party, and the party's parliamentary chief Nigel Dodds, said their position hasn't changed following the announcement of the deal, and said they \"could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Britain and the European Union have struck a Brexit deal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Thursday.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
