Nextrift got its hands on what appears to be a production Pixel 4 XL, and it posted impressions and some new details, including what seems to be the first public look at the next-gen Google Assistant, which Google announced in May at Google I/O.\n\nGoogle says the next-gen Assistant would be \u201cup to 10 times faster,\u201d could respond to questions or requests without requiring you to say \u201cHey, Google\u201d each time, and queries will be processed on the device instead of being processed at Google\u2019s servers. In Nextrift\u2019s testing of the next-gen Assistant, it says it was \u201cnoticeably quicker\u201d at processing requests, and it could actually make requests of the Assistant without prompting with \u201cHey, Google\u201d for each question. It\u2019s unclear from Nextrift\u2019s impressions if Assistant was actually working on the device. Nextrift also has a picture of Assistant running on the Pixel 4 XL with what appears to be a slick new Assistant UI:\n\nNextrift shared new information about how the Pixel 4\u2019s face unlock technology may work. Nextrift said the face unlock setup process is a lot like Apple\u2019s Face ID, which matches with information about the setup process already shared by GenK. However, Nextrift seems to have actually found a way to make face unlock work. It says that \u201ca quick glance\u201d is all that\u2019s needed to unlock the Pixel 4 XL, and it works even if the phone is held sideways or upside down (which is something Google has already said it would do). Notably, Nextrift also found that the Pixel 4 XL\u2019s face unlock settings page has an interesting disclaimer: \u201cYour phone can be unlocked by someone who looks a lot like you, say, an identical sibling.\u201d\n\nNextrift also noticed an interesting tidbit in the settings of its Pixel 4 XL. We have seen in other leaks that the rumored variable refresh display, apparently called Smooth Display, would \u201cdynamically\u201d adjust the screen\u2019s refresh rate between 60 Hz and 90 Hz. Nextrift found that, when it switched on Smooth Display, the display\u2019s refresh rate appeared to be \u201clocked\u201d at 90 Hz, and it speculated that it would dip to 60 Hz if an app didn\u2019t support the faster refresh rate.\n\nGoogle is expected to announce more about the Pixel 4 at an event on October 15th. We\u2019ll be there covering everything from the show. But at the current rate of leaks, Google might not have any surprises left to show.", "description": "Leaks of the Pixel 4, a phone that we already seem to know a lot about, just keep coming.
