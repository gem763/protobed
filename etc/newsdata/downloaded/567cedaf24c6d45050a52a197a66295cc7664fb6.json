It\u2019s kind of a cancer on progressivism,\" Maher said on \"Morning Joe\" hours before the third Democratic primary debate.\n\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough had asked the comedian about the 2020 field's criticism of former President Obama: \"How maddening is that to you that they're having this race to the far left?\"\n\nSeveral media personalities criticized the 2020 field after the second primary debate when most candidates knocked the Obama administration on issues like immigration and health care as a way to attack the frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOBAMA ALLIES FUME AS DEM CANDIDATES BLAST LEGACY TO SCORE POINTS ON BIDEN: 'WRONG AND TERRIBLE'\n\nBiden has stood by the previous administration's Affordable Care Act as other candidates have pursued more aggressive reforms like \"Medicare for All.\"\n\nMaher warned that Democrats risked hurting their electoral prospects by moving so far to the left, saying that Democrats would only lose if they are \"scarier or crazier\" than Trump.\n\n\"If you run on taking away people\u2019s health care and taxing them too much and taking away all of their guns and trans women get abortion rights -- I think that came up in the first debate, I don\u2019t think you are going to win this election,\" he added.\n\nMaher called for the Democratic Party to have a \"Sister Souljah\" moment, referring to former President Bill Clinton distancing himself from a DJ's racially charged comment in 1992. The phrase \"Sister Souljah moment\" has come to represent politicians publicly rejecting extreme people or positions.\n\nHARRY REID RIPS DEMS OVER 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL,' BORDER POLICIES: 'OF COURSE' IT WILL HURT US IN 2020\n\nMaher isn't the only one to call out Democrats' drift towards the left. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., predicted that 2020 Democrats would alienate voters by pushing to decriminalize border crossings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThere are so many more important things to do. Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list,\u201d he recently told Vice.\n\nHe also indicated that \"Medicare for all\" would be \"much harder to sell\" than building upon the Affordable Care Act.", "description": "HBO host Bill Maher derided 2020 Democrats' apparent shift to the left during the primary season, suggesting it was a plague on the progressive movement.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
