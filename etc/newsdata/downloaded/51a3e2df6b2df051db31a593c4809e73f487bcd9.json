Revolution for our age!\u201d he said in Mandarin in an interview.\n\nHe also pulled a mask over his face.\n\nThe mask is similar to those being used by protesters in the streets of Hong Kong to hide their identity.\n\nThe move has players like 15-year-old Phoenix Bruneau boycotting the game.\n\n\u201cI think that the punishment was completely absurd,\u201d said the Montreal teen who heard about the news from his dad.\n\nPhoenix Bruneau, 15, is boycotting Hearthstone. (CBC)\n\nHe said blitzchung was exercising freedom of speech and a shorter suspension would have been more appropriate.\n\nPlayer broke the rules\n\nBlitzchung, whose real name is Chung Ng Wai, won\u2019t receive any prize money for participating and winning games in the Grandmasters match.\n\n\u201cI expected the decision by Blizzard,\u201d blitzchung told IGN.com. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair, but I do respect their decision. I\u2019m not [regretful] of what I said.\u201d\n\nBlizzard said in a statement that the player had violated the game\u2019s rules, which state players cannot offend \u201ca portion or group of the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter an investigation, we are taking the necessary actions to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\u201d\n\nHearthstone is a card game developed by Blizzard Entertainment.

It could cause me [a] lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it\u2019s my duty to say something about the issue.\u201d\n\nPhoenix said the suspension could have serious implications for Blizzard if a lot of people boycott.\n\n\u201cI think it could have a huge impact on the company,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if they don\u2019t \u2026 revoke the punishments or just completely undo what they did, they might get some huge backlash.\u201d\n\nThere have been reports that Blizzard employees walked off the job in protest on Wednesday.\n\nCBC reached out to Blizzard Entertainment for comment but did not hear back.\n\nWith files from Reuters and CBC News", "description": "A Hearthstone player has been suspended after making pro-democracy comments about Hong Kong in an interview.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/Blizzard_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
