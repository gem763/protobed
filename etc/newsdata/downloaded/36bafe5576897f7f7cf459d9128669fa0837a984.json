The ratio refers to the volume of waste material required to be handled in order to extract a tonne of ore, with a lower ratio usually signalling better profitability.\n\nBAS and BP have a contract with TIE to supply coal to PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, a state-owned electricity company, to fulfil a 25 per cent domestic market obligation (DMO) requirement from an approved annual coal production plan.\n\nBAS and BP\u2019s DMO sales for the financial half year ended June 30, 2019 was 1.8 million tonnes.\n\nBased on the proforma financial effects of the proposed purchase, Geo Energy said it expects to account a bargain purchase to its earnings.\n\nThe adjusted average cost of sales on the BAS and BP coal for H1 2019 was US$32.50 to US$33.60 per tonne against the current average of the Indonesian Coal Price Index for 5000 and 4200 GAR coal of US$39.43 per tonne on Sept 20, 2019.\n\nGeo Energy said it expects the proposed acquisition to be positive and value accretive to the group.\n\nThe deal will increase its total proven coal reserves from 78 million tonnes to about 122 million tonnes as at June 30, 2019.\n\nCoal prices have continued to show resilience, trading at a range of US$30.20 to US$40.40 per tonne between Jan 4, 2019 to Sept 20, 2019 for Indonesia's Coal Price Index, said the company.\n\nSouth Sumatra has abundant coal and is located in close proximity to key export markets such as India, China and South-east Asian countries, including Indonesian domestic markets, it added.\n\nAccording to Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, South Sumatra holds over 39 per cent of Indonesia\u2019s\n\ncoal reserves but accounts for less than 10 per cent of the country\u2019s coal production in 2018.\n\nCompared to Kalimantan coal, South Sumatra coal offers estimated freight and barging cost savings of US$5-10 per\n\ntonne to supply coal to power plants in West Java and Sumatra due to shorter hauling and shipping distance from the mine to the buyers\u2019 destination, said the company.\n\n\"The proposed acquisition is in line with the company\u2019s business strategy to expand its business operations and increase its coal reserves and production levels,\" said Charles Melati, executive chairman of Geo Energy.\n\n\"Since the issuance of our US$300 million senior note in 2017, we have been actively looking an earnings accretive and in-production coal asset with ready infrastructure, right price and conditions.\"\n\nThe firm had at the end of August submitted a revised non-binding proposal to acquire new coal assets for a producing coal mine in East Kalimantan, Indonesia.\n\nGeo Energy shares closed flat at S$0.148 on Friday.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - COAL producer Geo Energy Resources has acquired a majority stake in two South Sumatra coal mines for US$25 million. .
