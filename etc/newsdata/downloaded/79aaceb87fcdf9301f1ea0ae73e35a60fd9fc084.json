On the one hand, it\u2019s a long time since Young made a genuinely great album of original material \u2013 the Daniel Lanois-produced Le Noise, which came out nearly a decade ago \u2013 and longer still since he managed to reach anything like the skyscraping artistic heights he attained as a matter of course in the 1970s: the charts are full of people who weren\u2019t even born when Sleeps With Angels was released in 1994.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Neil Young and Crazy Horse: Colorado album artwork. Photograph: Publicity image\n\nOn the other hand, Colorado is an album recorded amid personal turmoil \u2013 his ex-wife Pegi died of cancer in January; Elliot Roberts, his manager and co-conspirator for half a century, passed away in June \u2013 and, unfortunately for him, Young has a tendency to make his best albums amid personal turmoil and loss: On the Beach, Tonight\u2019s the Night, Sleeps With Angels, even Le Noise, which was haunted by the loss of longtime collaborators Ben Keith and Larry Johnson.\n\nThen again, Colorado arrives with an accompanying film, Mountaintop, and there are few phrases more likely to sink the spirits of the long-term Young fan than \u201cNeil\u2019s made another film\u201d. Young has persisted in making films since the early 70s without ever getting any better at it; his filmography is a now-bulging file of evidence to suggest he should step away from the director\u2019s chair for the good of humanity. As it turns out, Mountaintop is merely boring, rather than excruciating: anyone who wants to spend 90 minutes watching Neil Young arguing about the volume of his amplifier and inhaling oxygen to combat the altitude of the Colorado studio where he\u2019s recording is in for a treat, but better that than one of his arthouse films, which can leave you wondering if the more repressive Middle East theocracies didn\u2019t have a point when it came to banning cinema altogether.\n\nThe album itself, meanwhile, reunites Young with Crazy Horse, his most dependable backing band. Like Young\u2019s film-making, Crazy Horse have somehow contrived to get no better at all over 50 years. Unlike Young\u2019s film-making, they didn\u2019t need to improve: from the moment they lumbered into view, horrifying Young\u2019s peers with their rudimentary abilities, Crazy Horse sounded amazing, like some hulking, rusty bit of farm machinery that barely works but somehow generates incredible power. You can hear it on Colorado\u2019s centrepiece, She Showed Me Love: there\u2019s an astonishing moment halfway through when drummer Ralph Molina just stops playing, as though he mistakenly thinks the song\u2019s over, before sheepishly starting up again a couple of beats later. But the potency of the grinding din they create is inarguable, elevating Young\u2019s hokey lyrics \u2013 Mother Nature pushing Earth around in a pram, etc \u2013 adding an unmistakeable edge. They do the same on Shut It Down: the contrast between the sweetness of their harmonies and the corrosive noise of their guitars is enough to distract you from their leader wailing: \u201cWhat about the animals? What about the birds and bees?\u201d\n\nThe problem with Colorado is that Young doesn\u2019t want you to be distracted from his lyrics: the pretty Green Is Blue aside, the melodies are largely perfunctory and Young talks as much as he sings. He\u2019s never been more politically and socially engaged than in recent years, which has led him to toss off screeds of songs in the all-the-news-that\u2019s-fit-to-sing style of an old protest folkie. It\u2019s a mode that served him well on 1970\u2019s livid Ohio, but in truth, most of his great sociopolitical songs are oblique: the hallucinatory After the Gold Rush; Campaigner\u2019s complex meditation on Richard Nixon\u2019s demise; Rockin\u2019 in the Free World\u2019s equivocal response to the collapse of communism. Of late, his political songs have been almost painfully on the nose. As one critic rightly noted of 2015\u2019s The Monsanto Years, the lyrics were so prosaic, it frequently felt like reading an article about the dangers of GMO; it was more effective as protest \u2013 Monsanto considered suing him \u2013 than it was as music. Here, the focus is once more on politics \u2013 Roberts\u2019s passing is alluded to in the touching ballad Olden Days, and there are a couple of songs clearly inspired by new wife Daryl Hannah, but other than that, it\u2019s the horrors of climate change, Trump and the alt-right all the way. You never doubt Young\u2019s sincerity, but he expresses his message via cliches and sloganeering.\n\nIn fairness, maybe he feels he has to be as direct as possible. Most artists who essay this kind of stuff do so expecting their audience to nod in agreement, but Young\u2019s fans don\u2019t necessarily cleave to any liberal consensus, as evidenced by the bedlam caused among their ranks by 2006\u2019s anti-Bush Living With War. But the end result is another Neil Young album to add to the pile of the not-bad and the OK he\u2019s amassed over the last decade, while a steady stream of archive releases highlight how great Neil Young can be at his best: as good as any artist in rock history, and certainly better than this.\n\nThis week Alexis listened to\n\nFloating Points \u2013 Bias\n\nThe greatness of Sam Shepherd\u2019s second album distilled into one track: starts out as pensive and haunting home listening, explodes into dancefloor life midway through.", "description": "Deeply personal ballads and the incredible potency of his band elevate Young\u2019s 39th album above his painfully on-the-nose political messaging", "authors": ["Alexis Petridis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67aa1933545e3bd6716428c0ab6927642e6ead7/0_25_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=905a97a3e6c3c0fcf08cdac77cb8634b", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
