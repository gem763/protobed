Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cI never thought that I would get to 100,\u201d Williams said after the match, reflecting on the two decades she\u2019s spent playing at Flushing Meadows. \u201cIt\u2019s so special. I never want to let it go.\u201d\n\nThe eighth-seeded American joins Chris Evert as the only two players to log at least 100 victories at the tournament. Williams is now only one behind Evert\u2019s mark.\n\nThe 37-year-old Williams was dominant from the start, firing off 25 winners, compared to zero from 18th-seed Wang, and winning 90% of her first serve points.\n\nDuring her fourth-round match on Sunday, Williams slipped and fell while running to the net and twisted her right ankle but said on Tuesday she was feeling \u201cgreat\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt feels good,\u201d Williams said of her performance. \u201cThis is how hard I\u2019ve been working. It feels like ... hard work pays off when that happens.\u201d\n\nWilliams pumped her fist in celebration after firing off a forehand winner in front of a roaring crowd to end the contest.\n\n\u201cI am who I am. I\u2019ve always been the person that goes out there and roars and screams and complains and cries and fights,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely passionate about what I do. Most people that love their jobs are passionate about what they do. That\u2019s just me.\u201d\n\nShe also praised the progress made in women\u2019s tennis over her career, calling it the \u201cpremier sport for women\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best work in the world that a woman can do, in my mind. I\u2019m a little biased obviously,\u201d said the 37-year-old.\n\n\u201cI feel like we fought so hard for so many years for so many different things. I feel like we still obviously have a ways to go, but a lot of that fighting through decades has come through.\u201d\n\nWang, who had not faced Williams before, was unable to save any of the five break point opportunities against her and said she simply could not stand up to the power from the 23-times Grand Slam champion.\n\n\u201cI cannot handle it. Just too much for me,\u201d said Wang.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nWilliams faces fifth-seed Elina Svitolina, who she leads 4-1 in head-to-head, in the semi-finals.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t make a lot of mistakes,\u201d said Williams when asked about the upcoming matchup. \u201cShe\u2019s one of those players that does everything really well.\n\n\u201cSo I have to do everything well, too.\u201d", "description": "Serena Williams claimed her 100th win at the U.S. Open in style on Tuesday, dismantling her quarter-final opponent Wang Qiang 6-1 6-0 in a blistering 44-minute performance that ended any questions over a twisted ankle from the previous round.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1425949109&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8300U"}
