(Screenshot: UpGuard)\n\nA California-based security company on Thursday revealed its researchers had discovered more than 1.7 terabytes of proprietary telecommunications data left publicly online, including hardware specifications for a lawful surveillance device used throughout the Russian Federation.\n\nTechCrunch first reported on the exposed files discovered by a data breach hunter working at UpGuard.\n\nAmong the cache are reportedly documents detailing a major infrastructure project involving the installation of lawful intercept devices used by Russian authorities to surreptitiously collect phone and internet communications. The documents appear to primarily concern Mobile TeleSystems (MTS), Russia\u2019s largest telecom company, and Nokia, which maintains and updates MTS\u2019s network.\n\nThe devices \u2014 known in the West as \u201cSORM\u201d or \u201cSystem for Operative Investigative Activities\u201d \u2014 are a key facet of Russian domestic surveillance. Approved for use by the FSB, Russia\u2019s federal security service (formerly known as the KGB), Russian law mandates that telecom operators install and maintain the devices, the first of which was developed in 1995. The latest version of SORM, which was rolled out in 2014, reportedly also performs deep packet inspection.\n\nOther Russian agencies may also tap into the data collected by SORM, including the SBP, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s personal security service. Work related to SORM is typically classified, an expert at Russian digital-rights told TechCrunch.\n\nDozens of countries require telecom providers to retain certain data and install technologies for real-time eavesdropping. Privacy protections range from strong in some countries to others where rules restricting police access are non-existent.\n\nWith passage of the Yarovaya law in 2016, Russian telecoms are required to store text messages, phone conversations, and other communications for up to six months. Metadata, likewise, for up to three years. Authorities do not require a court order to access it.\n\nIn the U.S., a warrant issued on probable cause is generally required before law enforcement can access the same kinds of information, in all but a few circumstances.\n\nCertain \u201cnational security\u201d exemptions do exist enabling agencies, such as the FBI, to collect some internet and phone data without a warrant. Emails stored remotely for 181 days or more may also be obtained warrantlessly under the Stored Communications Act, as another example.\n\nAn exposed document showing Nokia\u2019s involvement in installing SORM devices. (Screenshot: UpGuard)\n\nUpGuard reports that the exposed data was stored on an unprotected backup device and that it appeared to belong mostly to Nokia, which later confirmed that a Nokia employee handed the data over to an unnamed third party who \u201cfailed to follow his company\u2019s business processes, security policies, and his personal responsibility to protect it,\u201d according to UpGuard.\n\nUpGuard reported that the data was no longer publicly accessible as of September 14.\n\n\u201cExposing any data related to a system with the power and secrecy of SORM to the public internet is an event,\u201d UpGuard said in a statement. \u201cLeaking what appears to be an inventory of the most recent generation of installed hardware for a nation\u2019s largest telecom provider is unprecedented.\u201d\n\nRead the full UpGuard report here.\n\n[TechCrunch]", "description": "A California-based security company on Thursday revealed its researchers had discovered more than 1.7 terabytes of proprietary telecommunications data left publicly online, including hardware specifications for a lawful surveillance device used throughout the Russian Federation....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Sam Rutherford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/the4mptj0zu105gbeyp1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
