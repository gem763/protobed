Surely the committee\u2019s strength-of-schedule statistics churn already with those wins plus Auburn\u2019s opener against Oregon in Arlington, Tex.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHeading into a hard inter-division, all-top-10 game Saturday at Florida (5-0), Auburn has proved the most of any team thus far.\n\nCollege football polls\n\nOf course, the rankings at the moment, the Associated Press media poll and that festival of the oblivious known as the coaches\u2019 poll, do not reflect this. That\u2019s because rankings rely upon ancient American methods passed down through the generations, valuing categories such as Programs That Were Great Last Year, Programs That Have Been Great A Long Time, Teams I Thought Were Really Good In August When Everybody Was 0-0, Teams I Perceive To Be Better Than Those Who Have Proved More At This Point and, in the case of the coaches, Teams I Wrote Down Because I Have No Life And Don\u2019t Have Any Time To Put Into This Process.\n\nAlabama ranks No. 1 in the Associated Press, trading places with No. 2 Clemson. The teams with the most impressive wins \u2014 Auburn, LSU and Georgia \u2014 stand at Nos. 7, 6 and 3.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAuburn\u2019s re-rise, which seems to happen every few years like some bird migration of a haphazard frequency, has made the Southeast seem even more crowded with monsters than usual, and four games remaining on its schedule \u2014 at Florida and at LSU, home to Georgia and Alabama \u2014 do cause the skin to roil. Florida itself went from forgettable to curious in one moment Sept. 14 in Kentucky, one of those crazy junctures in American life when an unknown quarterback (junior Kyle Trask) comes in at some dismal point (the start of the fourth quarter) and suddenly everything looks different from then on (turning a \u00ad21-10 deficit into a 29-21 win).\n\nAs for Auburn quarterback Bo Nix, do gaze at these stats from his fifth-ever college game and his second Southeastern Conference game: 16-for-21 passing, 335 yards, two touchdowns, zero interceptions; seven rushes, 56 yards, one touchdown, one 30-yard run. What numerical beauty, and no wonder Mississippi State Coach Joe Moorhead said, \u201cHe\u2019s obviously a coach\u2019s son, very poised and polished, and well-coached, for a true freshman midyear enrollee.\u201d (His father, former Auburn quarterback Patrick Nix, coached him in high school in Pinson, Ala.) Said Malzahn, \u201cI think you see him, every game and every snap, he\u2019s feeling a little bit more confident, and the game gets slower.\u201d\n\nThe committee members can see all that even without going to that magic football room at the gaudy hotel in Dallas-Fort Worth, but even if they probably wouldn\u2019t rank Clemson No. 1, they do know Clemson when they see it. Among other things across the various escapes of its dynasty, Clemson has shown a rarefied mastery of the fine point of the game known as two-point-conversion defense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s defensive end Carlos Watkins\u2019s tackle against Notre Dame for that 24-22 win in 2015, Austin Bryant\u2019s chase of Texas A&M quarterback Kellen Mond to enable the interception and 28-26 win in 2018 and, Saturday in that hairy 21-20 win, the three-man corral of North Carolina quarterback Sam Howell, starring Xavier Thomas, Nolan Turner and James Skalski. (It\u2019s important to give full credit to two-point-conversion defenders, whose exploits change the moods of entire towns.)\n\nCollege football winners and losers: Unpacking Clemson\u2019s escape\n\nThat\u2019s not even counting the fan panic attacks of Clemson\u2019s national-title year of 2016 \u2014 against Lamar Jackson\u2019s Louisville, yearning for N.C. State to miss a field goal (which it did), a 37-34 ping-pong match with Florida State, the 43-42 loss to Pitt \u2014 or the 94-yard drive to elude Syracuse in the national-title year of 2018, hinging on its fourth-and-six pass from Chase Brice to Tee Higgins.\n\nThe point is, paths to titles often bubble with bygone peril, such that Clemson ought to fashion some historical plaque honoring its two-point defenses. \u201cI am unbelievably proud of our guys for finding a way to win,\u201d Coach Dabo Swinney told reporters Saturday in Chapel Hill, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s what winners do.\u201d He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to win. I know we\u2019re just supposed to show up and beat everybody by double digits and all that, but this is college football.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis sophomore quarterback, Trevor Lawrence, seems to have lost the Heisman Trophy after being given the Heisman Trophy this summer even though they don\u2019t give the Heisman Trophy until December, all in a lunatic nation. His touchdown-to-interception ratio stands at so-so after eight offseason months of unrequested hype and five in-season games, but he does look happy anyway. He said, \u201cI think this game will make us a lot better,\u201d and: \u201cThe thing I\u2019ll take out of this is never, I guess, [never] don\u2019t enjoy the win. It\u2019s easy to forget how hard it is to win.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, any committee, even one in a bar, would ponder other teams \u2014 especially Ohio State (5-0), which, after the 48-7 hushing it dealt Nebraska, is doing a great job at the hard job of beating people the way everyone thinks it\u2019s supposed to beat people. For enchantment, think of Wake Forest (5-0 for the first time in 13 years), SMU (5-0 with a treasured win over TCU), Baylor (4-0 with a good win over Iowa State as Coach Matt Rhule soars again), Memphis (4-0) and that clot in the Big Ten West of Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota, which have combined for zero losses.\n\nMike Leach calls his players \u2018fat, dumb and happy and entitled\u2019 after another Pac-12 loss\n\nThen revel a moment, as should all, in Appalachian State (4-0), which followed its emotional win over North Carolina with a no-letdown, \u00ad56-37 win over Coastal Carolina, lending appeal to its Nov. 9 date with South Carolina, given the way the Mountaineers clearly handle Carolinas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the top of it all, though, moving into October, a studious committee should place Auburn, then adjourn, cup its ears and listen. It might even hear caterwauling from those who know Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa, steering through the predicted routs of outmanned others, has a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 23-0. That\u2019s a wow almost as compelling as Auburn\u2019s schedule.\n\nRead more:\n\nJohn Feinstein: App State, still the biggest little college football program going\n\nCollege football has Rivalry Week, Week Zero and now Redshirt Week\n\nA referee was shot by a cannon during a college football game\n\nAD", "description": "The Tigers have proved the most of any team thus far.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0dE4CqSPoOZwHgN645_cMb-O4Kg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HDNZM2HC6EI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
