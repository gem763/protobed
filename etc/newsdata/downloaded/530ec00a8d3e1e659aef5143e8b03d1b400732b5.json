According to the outlet, 55 percent of respondents \u2014 who had all reportedly visited the chain within the last six months \u2014 agreed that the establishment was consistently the most spick-and-span.\n\nCompetitors, including In-N-Out and Starbucks, followed close behind in second and third place, respectively, with Panera Bread, Culver's, Chipotle, Whataburger and Five Guys rounding out the list behind. Notably, less than 10 percent of people polled cited McDonald\u2019s, Burger King or Subway as having the cleanest fast-food restaurants in the business, the outlet said.\n\nOn the other hand, Chick-fil-A was blasted by business publication QSR Magazine in a new study that listed the chicken chain as running the slowest drive-thru among its fast-food peers.\n\nCHICK-FIL-A'S TORONTO OPENING STORMED BY PROTESTERS: 'CLUCK OFF'\n\nAnonymous shoppers tasked with judging the competition reported that a trip to the Chick-fil-A drive-thru included an average, lengthy wait time of five minutes, 23 seconds \u2014 almost 40 seconds slower than McDonald\u2019s, which was said to have the next-slowest average wait time of the ten chains polled, said the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nCustomers seeking an even quicker bite to eat would best be advised to hit Dunkin\u2019, Wendy\u2019s and Burger King \u2014 which have the three fastest drive-thrus, the findings say \u2014 while Taco Bell, Carl's Jr., KFC, Arby's and Hardees closed out the rankings.\n\nAccording to QSR, Chick-fil-A\u2019s slow drive-thru times may be caused in part to its growing popularity.\n\nKhalilah Cooper, director of service and hospitality for the chain, told the outlet that the brand is investigating new digital options to streamline, and ultimately speed up, the restaurant\u2019s to-go windows across America.\n\n\"We are embracing technology to both provide a better experience for guests and to help take tasks off restaurant team members so they can devote more time to hospitality for our customers,\" Cooper said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nOver the summer, Chick-fil-A was once again named America\u2019s favorite limited-service restaurant based on customer satisfaction.\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, the fast-food chain topped the American Customer Satisfaction Index for limited-service restaurant chains. The index is based on results from nearly 23,000 consumers.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAccording to a news release, the chain reported over $10 billion in revenue in 2018.\n\nFox News\u2019 Michael Hollan contributed to this report.", "description": "You win some, you lose some, Chick-fil-A.", "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
