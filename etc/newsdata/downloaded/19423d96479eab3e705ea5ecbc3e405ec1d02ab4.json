His team, for the fifth straight week, had not accomplished what it set out to do \u2014 this time getting dismantled 33-7 by the defending-champion New England Patriots. Gruden\u2019s change at quarterback, installing Colt McCoy as the team\u2019s new starter days earlier, did not work.\n\nNearly three minutes into his five-minute presser, Gruden was finally asked the question weighing on everyone\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s told me anything,\u201d Gruden said, referencing his job status. \u201cI don\u2019t have a concern. I\u2019ll just wait and see if my key works on Monday.\u201d\n\nIf the Redskins are planning to fire Gruden, the two men who will make that decision \u2014 owner Dan Snyder and team president Bruce Allen \u2014 did not stick around to give any indication on which way they were leaning.\n\nThe two men left the Redskins\u2019 locker room and quickly got into a car headed out of the stadium.\n\nInside, players were left guessing whether they\u2019ll have a new coach. Sunday\u2019s game didn\u2019t look, early on, like the kind of game that might cost a coach his job.\n\nFor two quarters, the Redskins were surprisingly competitive \u2014 even taking the lead on a brilliantly designed end-around to Steven Sims that went for a 65-yard touchdown.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 defense looked strong, generating pressure and sacking Tom Brady three times in the first half. Safety Montae Nicholson even picked off the six-time Super Bowl champion.\n\nWashington caught a few breaks. First, Patriots kicker Mike Nugent missed an extra-point attempt, keeping the Redskins in the lead. Then in the second quarter, when Washington committed two disastrous turnovers, the defense held firm \u2014 limiting the Patriots to one field goal.\n\nBut the Patriots are a better team than the Redskins. That was evident before the game, and unfolded gradually over the course of the afternoon.\n\nMcCoy, who took over from Case Keenum and rookie Dwayne Haskins, did not look equipped to handle the league\u2019s No. 1-ranked defense. Making his first start since breaking his leg last December, the 33-year-old was under constant pressure and was sacked six times.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 offense was also a mess. Washington punted 10 times and converted only one third down.\n\nEntering the game, Gruden turned to McCoy in hopes the quarterback\u2019s familiarity with his system would help lift a struggling offense. But McCoy threw for just 119 yards on 27 attempts.\n\nWith the offense ineffective, the Redskins\u2019 defense fell apart in the second half. They gave up 21 points after halftime, with defenders disorganized on various plays. New England\u2019s third touchdown of the half, for example, was the result of a Washington miscommunication in the end zone and tight end Ryan Izzo was wide open for the easy score.\n\nAfter a slow start, Brady still finished with 348 yards and was pulled in the fourth quarter \u2014 no need to risk injury with the game in-hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear something has to change,\u201d running back Adrian Peterson said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing you do know because we are 0-5. We haven\u2019t won. We haven\u2019t been productive as an offense.\u201d\n\nPeterson, who finished with 18 yards on seven carries, said he didn\u2019t know what to expect regarding Gruden\u2019s future.\n\nWhile meeting with reporters, Gruden was again dismissive of the idea of making staff changes. He said it\u2019s too late in the year to install a new defensive or offensive system, especially with the team\u2019s injuries. The Redskins were without key pieces Sunday like star left tackle Trent Williams (holdout), guard Brandon Scherff (ankle) and tight ends Jordan Reed and Vernon Davis (concussions).\n\n\u201cWe just got to perform better and do a better job,\u201d said Gruden, who in six seasons is the longest-tenured coach under Snyder.\n\nRegardless, Gruden\u2019s future, remains the season\u2019s dominant storyline. The Redskins face a hapless, 0-4 Miami Dolphins team next week and a loss could be catastrophic for Gruden \u2014 if he makes it that far.\n\nRunning back Chris Thompson, however, said it was \u201ctough\u201d to think about his coach possibly being fired. As he started to talk, the 28-year-old began to get choked up \u2014 slowly taking his time to try to complete his thoughts. The two are close, as Gruden stuck by Thompson in 2014 when the then-second-year back was demoted to the practice squad.\n\nHe began to cry.\n\n\u201cI really care about Jay,\u201d Thompson said, wiping tears from his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, man. You know I feel like he was one of the guys that really believed in me. And (he) wanted me to stay here through his whole legacy as coach.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
