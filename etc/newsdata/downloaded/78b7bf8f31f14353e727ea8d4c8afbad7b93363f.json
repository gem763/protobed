A previous version of this video misquoted the lieutenant. USA TODAY\n\nFORT MYERS, Fla. \u2013 The man who has confessed to more than 90 murders is now considered by the FBI to be the \"most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.\"\n\nIn a news release Sunday, the FBI confirmed that Samuel Little, 79, has confessed to 93 murders. The FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program confirmed that Little has been matched to 50 cases, with 43 confessions pending confirmation. The FBI has asked for the public's assistance in verifying the remaining cases.\n\nInvestigators also provided new information and details about five cases in Florida, Arkansas, Kentucky, Nevada and Louisiana.\n\nA drawing made by the convicted killer and distributed by the FBI purports to show the woman he said he killed in 1984 in the Fort Myers area.\n\nThe FBI released two recent drawings of a possible Fort Myers, Florida-area murder victim from 1984, drawn by serial murder suspect Samuel Little and based on memories of his murder victims. (Photo: Special to The News-Press)\n\nOne of the 43 unconfirmed cases is linked to information Fort Myers police said they received in 2018 from Texas Ranger James Holland.\n\nHolland told Fort Myers investigators that Little had confessed to the 1984 killing in Fort Myers. In December 2018, Fort Myers Police Department homicide Detectives Mali Langton and Dan Losapio, along with Assistant State Attorney Sara Miller, traveled to Decatur, Texas, and interviewed Little at the Wise County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nIn Ohio: 'He's going to die in prison': Serial killer pleads guilty to strangling 2 women decades ago\n\nOhio indictment: Serial killer Samuel Little, who has confessed to killing 93 women, indicted in Ohio cold cases\n\nLittle provided detectives with a detailed confession but he was unable to provide the details needed to identify the victim.\n\nDetectives worked with the medical examiner's office and other surrounding law enforcement agencies to identify the victim and met with families of homicide victims from the 1970s and '80s.\n\nSamuel Little booking timeline (Photo: Special to The News-Press)\n\nFort Myers police said Monday that detectives are aware that the Fort Myers victim\u2019s death may have been ruled an overdose, an accident, undetermined causes, may never have been discovered or may not have occurred in 1984.\n\nLittle spent time in Fort Myers and Collier County in the '70s through the '90s and was arrested in Collier County twice in 1993.\n\nIn August 2019, Holland met Langton during a homicide conference in Texas and advised her that Little had recently provided him with two drawings of the Fort Myers victim.\n\nDrawings: A serial killer says he drew his victims. The FBI hopes the images will help solve murders\n\nIn a confession to investigators, Little said that, in approximately 1984, he killed a 5-foot 6-inch female with brown skin, who weighed approximately 130 to 140 pounds, in Fort Myers. Little stated he and \u201cJean\u201d (now identified as Orelia Jean Dorsey \u2013 deceased) used to sell clothes to the woman\u2019s family. Little stated he drove the woman to an island with a wooded tract of land, near some railroad tracks.\n\nLittle stated he strangled her and left her in the island in short grass. Little stated the area was in the county just outside of the city limits.\n\nArrest photo of Samuel Little in Collier County, Florida. (Photo: Special to The News-Press)\n\nAnother of Little's unverified confessions is a killing he said took place in Covington, Kentucky, in 1984. He told officials he left a woman's body on a \"little round hill\" after strangling her in the backseat of his car.\n\nThey'd met at a strip club, he told officials, and she'd asked him for a ride to Miami to see her mother.\n\nAuthorities say Little's murders of women across the U.S. happened between 1970 and 2005 in 16 states.\n\nConfession: FBI: A convicted killer admitted to 90 murders in exchange for a prison transfer\n\nIn 2012, Little was arrested at a homeless shelter in Louisville, Kentucky, and extradited to California on a narcotics charge. The Los Angeles Police Department obtained DNA that connected Little to three unsolved homicides that occurred in 1987 and 1989. In 2013, the LAPD notified Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, or ViCAP, which initiated a full background investigation and found an alarming pattern that linked Little to many more murders.\n\nLittle was charged with three counts of murder and convicted and sentenced in 2014 to three consecutive life terms without parole.\n\nA release from the FBI Sunday said that in May 2018 the agency, along with the Texas Rangers, obtained detailed information on additional murders across the country that Little voluntarily provided.\n\nThe FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program has an ongoing investigation with the Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Texas Rangers, and dozens of state and local law enforcement agencies searching for cases that match Little\u2019s confessions.\n\nIf you have any information linked to Little's confessions, you should contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI or submit a tip online at tips.fbi.gov.
