It was Anthony Rendon bobblehead night and many fans expressed their frustration that the Nationals have not signed pending free agent Rendon to a contract extension and supported his MVP chances.\n\nThe Braves (91-58) now lead the Nationals (82-64) by 9\u00bd games in the National League East. Washington is 7-10 against the Braves this year.\n\nBraves star first sacker Freddie Freeman, with 38 homers and 117 RBI, left the game in the fourth inning with right elbow soreness, according to reports. He was replaced by Charlie Culberson, who has also torched Washington pitchers in his career.\n\nScherzer (10-6), who was on the injured list twice this summer, made just his fourth start at Nationals Park since the All-Star break.\n\nHe walked two and fanned six and was lifted for pinch-hitter Andrew Stevenson in the last of the fifth.\n\nThe Braves took a 2-0 lead in the fourth as Matt Joyce drove in a run single and Dansby Swanson had an RBI double.\n\nScherzer could have walked Swanson with two outs and pitch to Mike Soroka, the Atlanta pitcher who entered the game batting .083.\n\nNick Markakis, just off the injured list, had a hard-hit sacrifice fly to center off Scherzer in the fifth for a 3-0 advantage. Ozzie Albies hit a solo homer in the sixth \u2014 his 23rd of the year \u2014 for a 4-0 bulge off Washington reliever Tanner Rainey in the seventh.\n\nRafael Ortega of the Braves had an RBI double in the eighth off Hunter Strickland to make it 5-0.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s Soroka (12-4), in his third start in Washington this year, gave up just one hit and no runs in six innings with three walks and four strikeouts.\n\nNationals first base coach Tim Bogar was ejected in the last of the eighth for arguing with crew chief Tim Timmons, who was umpiring at first base. Washington still leads the wild-card race over the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe three-game series continues Saturday at 4:05 p.m. as Austin Voth (1-1, 4.00) pitches for Washington against Mike Foltynewicz (6-5, 5.00) of the Braves.\n\nAtlanta won the division title in 2018 while Washington captured the division crown in 2016-17.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
