REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain will make a decision soon about whether to allow Huawei equipment to be used in its 5G networks but China must play by the rules if it gets access to Western markets, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said.\n\nAsked when a decision would be made by the United Kingdom on Huawei, Wallace said on Wednesday: \u201cThe government will come to its position soon. We will get to a decision pretty soon.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe will not allow anything to compromise our sensitive networks in the UK but our technical advice is that there are places we can go to mitigate any security risk.\n\n\u201cThis is more than just technical - this is also about behaviour,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that the United Kingdom and other nations called out China publicly for some of its cyber activity. And if we are going to allow countries access to our markets, I think we should all expect a code of behaviour which is fair play.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Huawei plans first onshore bonds totalling 6 billion yuan", "description": "Britain will make a decision soon about whether to allow Huawei equipment to be used in its 5G networks but China must play by the rules if it gets access to Western markets, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428681280&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0Z5", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
