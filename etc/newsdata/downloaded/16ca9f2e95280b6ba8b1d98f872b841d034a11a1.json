Respect where it is due. None of this is meant to be condescending, by the way: if Leicester City had an owner like Newcastle has had these past few years then it probably wouldn\u2019t still be in business.\n\nI had the great privilege to find myself in close proximity to the Toon contingent and thus I could observe at close quarters their habits, and the various rituals of fanatical devotion. Of course they didn\u2019t come all that way to see their loyalty tested and their lads get beat, especially given the ridiculous late timing of the match.\n\nThe more their side suffered, the louder they got. Every goal conceded added to the chorus. An own goal by Paul Dummett sent them orgasmic. They were outnumbered ten to one by Leicester fans but, for most of them, they were far noisier. Indeed, hysterical. By the end of it in the cold drizzle some of them had stripped to the waist, pogoing to the beat from the sound system, bellies flying around.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYou\u2019d have thought they\u2019d put something in the Bovril, or just that they\u2019d won the league.\n\nI was not one of those Leicester supporters singing \u201cThere\u2019s only one Mike Ashley\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re going down with the Villa\u201d. It seemed cruel, in the circumstances. They had a chant aimed at us to the effect that we undemonstrative East Midlands types weren\u2019t as passionate as the Geordies. A fair point, amplified by the subdued silence in the rest of the stadium, because Leicester supporters have known too many false dawns to get over-excited.\n\nEvery football supporter must realise that they are only one careless proprietor or a complacent managers away from disaster \u2013 existentially so in some recent tragic cases. No club is too big to fail.\n\nFor a lot of the time the Newcastle fans spent as much time bigging themselves up as anything, with some song that went along the lines of the worst the team is they more they support them. Which is the point of being a fan, if you think about it. If they could take pride in nothing else, then they could at least have pride in themselves \u2013 undoubtedly right.\n\nNuanced, you see? That self-belief is the only analgesic to see them through the pain. I got the impression that relegation would be an opportunity to support their side even more ardently and, maybe, to purge the club of its past errors. The hard, punitive financial facts of dropping to the Championship make such liberation wishful thinking, and Newcastle would be humiliated even more grievously having to go and play the likes of Brentford, Nottingham Forest and, er, Middlesbrough.\n\nNUFC is clearly a big, historic club and with that most precious of assets \u2013 an astonishingly loyal fan base. On that basis, the Toon Army beat the blue army fans ten to nil on a wet Sunday night.\n\nThey, if not their team, really do not deserve to go down.", "description": "This is a tribute to the Newcastle United fans who turned up to the King Power stadium to see their side get thrashed by Leicester City 5-0 and proved that, whatever else, they must be the best fans in the Premier League.
