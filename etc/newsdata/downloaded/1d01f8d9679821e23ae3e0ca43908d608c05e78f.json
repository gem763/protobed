OMG. Why? She must be back soon.\"\n\nA third wrote: \"Right! Anyone else calling a return, brief or otherwise, from the queen b***h aka Janine?\"\n\nThis was echoed by a fourth fan who said: \"I wonder if @CharlieBrooks0 is reprising her role of Janine Butcher and this is the start of her return!\"\n\nEastEnders airs Mondays and Fridays at 8pm, and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30pm on BBC One.", "description": "EastEnders favourite Janine Butcher seems to be causing trouble for the Slaters, spelling rumours of a comeback", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Bbc Kieron Mccarron", "Bbc", "Kieron Mccarron"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13839140.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_EastEnders.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
