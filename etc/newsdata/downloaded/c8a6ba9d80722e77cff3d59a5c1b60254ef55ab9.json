That means these should take the place of analogue sticks, perfect for games that don\u2019t actually have analogue control anyway (and probably not the best for those that do).\n\nUnlike the Switch Lite itself, the D-pad isn\u2019t replacing the four-button array on the left side, which is still there. It\u2019s a weird-looking controller for sure.\n\nThough obviously designed to match the more colourful variations of the Switch Lite, the $US25 ($37) controllers, shipping October 30, also work with PC, MacOS and Android, with a switch on top that swaps between Switch and Xbox-compatible functionality.\n\nThey connect via USB-C cable or Bluetooth, and they feature a programmable turbo function, in case one needs a button to be pressed repeatedly in rapid fashion.\n\nIt looks weird, but also pretty damn cool. I can\u2019t look at pictures of these for too long without the overwhelming urge to bite into them. I\u2019m thinking the turquoise tastes like spearmint.\n\nAnd the yellow one probably tastes like lemon lollies.\n\nAnother possible outcome is they both probably taste like plastic. Even so, I am curious to test the accessibility of those R2 and L2 buttons, situated as they are along the top of the controller instead of behind the triggers or on the back.\n\nConsider me intrigued. I own a couple of 8BitDo controllers for my Analogue retro Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo consoles, and they have yet to let me down. Looking forward to getting my large hands on these odd-yet-pretty things later this year.", "description": "Styled after Nintendo\u2019s new Switch Lite, the 8BitDo Lite is a controller so ultra-portable that it has two directional pads instead of analogue sticks to keep it as thin as possible....", "authors": ["Jackson Ryan", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/pnixutbcdknqb8renywd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
