People in the Bahamas are losing everything, including their lives. Focus on that!https://t.co/Fj0z3qt0VX \u2014 TinseltownPR (@TinseltownPR) September 3, 2019\n\nThere are people stranded in a hurricane, in Bahamas, and you\u2019re showing Kardashian on vacation. Tone deaf, much? \u2014 Jo Burchfield (@burchfieldjo) September 2, 2019\n\nWhen this island is currently being devastated by a Cat. 5 hurricane, I find this article posted at an incredibly inappropriate time. Shine light on what really matters. \u2014 \u2661 (@chuchiii28) September 2, 2019\n\nNot the best timing for this article considering #HurricaneDorian. Let\u2019s try something called compassion. \u2014 Hugo Arenas (@hugoarenas) September 2, 2019\n\nWell this was an ill-timed and unnecessary article. The Bahamas are being decimated by a Cat 5 hurricane - that should have been the focus! \u2014 Pamela T (@pst8367) September 2, 2019\n\nPretty insensitive to post this article today, while the Bahamas are being decimated by Dorian. Be better, @people. \u2014 amy m (@day1516) September 2, 2019\n\nPeople did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe story appeared to have been updated later, however, as its link now clicks through to an article titled \u201cKim Kardashian Shares Bikini Photo from Her Bahamas Vacation Ahead of Deadly Hurricane.\u201d\n\nThere is no explanation for the alteration and the URL keywords remain as \u201ckim-kardashian-flaunt-waist-sexy-swimsuit-bahamas.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI find this article posted at an incredibly inappropriate time,\u201d wrote one person on Twitter.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6e4d493b00009605cbbd77.jpeg?cache=vzsi0x2qdn&ops=1778_1000"}
