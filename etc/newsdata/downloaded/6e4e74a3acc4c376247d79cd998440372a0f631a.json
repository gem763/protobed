Paddypower also lists the activist as out in front with punters, having Thunberg as 4/7 favorite. Oddschecker has her listed as 4/7 as well.\n\nAny prediction carries a great deal of uncertainty, since the list of candidates considered by the Nobel Committee isn\u2019t made public, yet Thunberg is being applauded because she launched a school strike that urged students to join her \u2018Fridays for Future\u2019 movement.\n\nThe movement implores school-age children to take time off of school to demonstrate and demand action to prevent further climate change.\n\nThunberg won Amnesty International\u2019s highest honour earlier this month and bookies\u2019 reckon this will follow through, bagging her the highest acclaim for peace keeping.\n\n\u201cWhat she has done over the past year is extraordinary,\u201d said Dan Smith, the director of Stockholm international peace research institute SIPRI. \u201cClimate change is an issue which is strongly related to security and peace.\u201d\n\nGreta Thunberg at #UNGA: \u201cThis is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\nVia ABC pic.twitter.com/NudonxKNss \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 23, 2019\n\nHowever, his counterpart at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, Henrik Urdal, said he didn\u2019t think she would win.\n\n\u201cExtremely unlikely,\u201d he said, noting her young age and the fact that a link between climate change and armed conflict remains unproven.\n\nAlso mentioned as possible winners are Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who has made peace with his bitter foe Eritrea, and NGOs including Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee received 301 nominations this year, but it never discloses the names.\n\nThe Nobel season opens Monday with the Medicine Prize, followed by the Physics and Chemistry Prizes. The awards wind up on October 14 with the Economics Prize.\n\nOne person who is not so enamoured is Russian President Vladimir Putin who chimed in yesterday, calling Thunberg a \u201cpoorly informed teenager\u201d who was being used by adults.\n\nPresident Putin accused her of failing to understand the realities of the modern world.\n\n\u201cI may disappoint you but I don\u2019t share the general excitement about Greta Thunberg\u2019s speech,\u201d Mr Putin, 66, told an energy forum in Moscow when asked about the Swedish activist\u2019s appearance at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cNo one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and diverse, that it is developing quickly, and that people in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth levels as in Sweden,\u201d Mr Putin said.\n\nAFP contributed to this story", "description": "Sixteen-year-old Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has been tagged by bookmakers as favorite for next week's Nobel Peace Prize.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Greta-Thunberg-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
