To dabble in the canon wars from anywhere near the right of center is to see oneself fired from that canon.\n\nBloom could be painfully oblivious to the ways in which shifting and enlarging of the canon was not merely necessary but joy-filled work. One reduces him to a caricature at one\u2019s peril, however. To read him closely, to get down into the grass with him, is rarely to find a padlocked mind.\n\nHe saw how the women in Saul Bellow\u2019s work were, to use his word, absurdities. In a later interview with the writer Amy Bloom (no relation), he noted how much great American poetry came from gay or bisexual writers. An uncompromising highbrow, Bloom sought to hoist his readers up to the level of what he saw as the greatest books.\n\nHe was born in New York City, where he grew up speaking Yiddish in an Orthodox Jewish household. His father was a garment worker from Odessa. He lost many relatives in the Holocaust. Bloom\u2019s life was a bildungsroman with the bildung done quite early; he seems to have emerged from the womb a capacious reader, starting with The Bible and Hart Crane.\n\nHis abiding interest in religious thought led him to write \u201cThe Book of J\u201d (1990), in which he asserted \u2014 without a great deal of evidence \u2014 that the first author of the Hebrew Bible was a learned woman in King Solomon\u2019s court. He would later say, \u201cEmerson is God,\u201d and remark to an interviewer: \u201cYou are confusing Shakespeare with God. I don\u2019t see why one shouldn\u2019t, as it were.\u201d", "description": "With his prodigious memory and ardor for literature, the uncompromising highbrow sought to hoist his readers up to the level of what he saw as the greatest books.", "authors": ["Dwight Garner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/books/review/15bloom-appraisal1/15bloom-appraisal1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
