I think we need a shake-up of the rules and I think it\u2019s something we need to look at after the election if we get a majority.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear how any government could act to curtail the speaker\u2019s discretion.\n\nThe speaker is the chief officer and highest authority in the House of Commons, and is elected to his position by MPs. As chair of the lower house, his position is not subject to the authority of the executive.\n\nHowever, it is possible that a ruling party with a large majority in the Commons could encourage its MPs to press for some kind of parliamentary review of the practices and conventions relating to the role.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
