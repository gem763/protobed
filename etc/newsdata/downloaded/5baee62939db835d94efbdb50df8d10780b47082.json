Check. Sexy She-Ra? Check. Sexier-than-usual burlesque dancer? Check.\n\nWe wonder what her main costume will be when Halloween actually rolls around on Thursday.\n\nSunglasses to block out the haters (Picture: iamKevinWong.com / BACKGRID)\n\nThe theme of Anastasia\u2019s party was \u2018Playboy\u2019 so it\u2019s no surprise that Paris decided to one-up everyone by wearing whatever the heck she wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFair play, Paris.\n\nWhile the Playboy bunnies were hopping around, the part-time DJ had her work cut out for her manning the ship.\n\nThe party was attended by YouTubers Tana Mongeau and Jake Paul (who dressed up as 2001 AMA\u2019s Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake), Kylie Jenner (who was probably the sexiest bunny there), Nikita Dragon, French Montana, Kelsey Calemine, and uh, her dad.\n\nThe entire ordeal looked super lavish and we wish we got an invite.\n\nParis recently dressed up as a schoolgirl for Demi Lovato\u2019s pre-Halloween party on Saturday evening.\n\nThis is like if Mean Girls was in a private school (Picture: NEMO/ CPR / BACKGRID)\n\nThe star wore a plaid mini-skirt with a ridiculously tight white top and sweater.\n\nHer outfit, however, was beaten by host Demi\u2019s Marie Antoinette costume.\n\nShe was in full glam complete with pearl makeup embellishments, a giant dusty blonde wig, and a very short version of a Georgian-era dress.\n\nSharing her costume on Instagram, the singer posted: \u2018Halloween round 1\u2026 I told y\u2019all I don\u2019t play on Halloween!! It\u2019s my time to shine.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
