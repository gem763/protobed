They acted as Ratchadech's involvement was made public, and he initially had been questioned by police and released without charge after denying any criminal actions.\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Lt. Gen. Sutthipong Wongpin said at a news conference on Wednesday that Ratchadech acknowledged bringing Thitima to his apartment but said he had no intention to do her harm and did not realize that she was dead while she was with him.\n\nPolice announced Tuesday that Thitima may have already been dead by the time Ratchadech brought her back to his apartment.\n\nThe said Wednesday that an autopsy found that Thitima had died from extreme alcohol intoxication, citing a blood alcohol concentration of 418 milligrams per 100 milliliters.\n\nThere had been speculation that Thitima was given a date rape drug such as GHB. But the drug rapidly disappears from the blood stream, making its presence difficult to confirm. Thai media cited police as saying none had been found in Ratchadech's apartment.\n\nPolice are investigating others who may be involved in the affair, especially the owner and guests at the house where Thitima attended the party before she died.\n\nHer death has raised interest in the dark side of the life of a pretty, when they can get into situations they cannot control.\n\nJaded Chouwilai, director of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation, said the case reflects the high risks of abuse, both sexual and nonsexual, toward women in that specialized service sector.\n\nThe foundation has studied the cases of young women working as sales promoters at beer drinking outlets nationwide, including pop-up booths.\n\nIt found that all suffered some manner of abuse: being forced to drink large amounts of alcoholic beverages, molestation, and other physical and verbal attacks.\n\n\"In the case of Lunlabelle, it happened in a private place and she was there all by herself and heavily drunk. Therefore, her risk of being attacked was much higher,\" Jaded said.\n\nJaded said that stereotyping and discrimination against this group of workers meant they drew little sympathy from the government and society at large.\n\n\"They need protection from being abused, just like other workers,\" he said.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
