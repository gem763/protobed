He was injured when he was hit by pitch from Boston reliever Josh Smith on Aug. 3.\n\n\u201cI think he knows how I feel about him and the dimension he brings to our lineup,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cSo excited to have him back.

New York currently has 16 players on the IL.\n\nThe Yankees acquired the 36-year-old from the Seattle Mariners on June 15. He is hitting .238 with nine homers and 27 RBIs in 36 games for New York, primarily at designated hitter.\n\nIn other injury news, Dellin Betances, who has yet to pitch this season because of right shoulder impingement, faced hitters in live batting practice Tuesday.\n\nOne of the batters Betances faced was Giancarlo Stanton, who is recovering from a right knee sprain.\n\nLuis Severino, who threw 33 pitches in one inning at Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and 12 more in the bullpen Sunday, is expected to make another rehab appearance Friday. Severino has yet to pitch this season after initially suffering rotator cuff inflammation in his right shoulder and then sustaining a lat strain while rehabbing his shoulder injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Yankees activated slugger Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n from the injured list before Tuesday night's game against the Texas Rangers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Fleisher"], "top_image": "https://twt-assets.washtimes.com/images/favicon.30333d68dff6.ico"}
