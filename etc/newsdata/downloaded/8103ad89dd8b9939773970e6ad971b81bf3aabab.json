Cummings, a sharecropper\u2019s son who rose to become a civil rights champion and the chairman of one of the U.S. House committees leading an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, died Thursday of complications from long-standing health problems. He was 68.\n\nCummings was a formidable orator who advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore and more well-to-do suburbs.\n\nAs chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Cummings led investigations of the president\u2019s governmental dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to Trump\u2019s family members serving in the White House.\n\nTrump criticized the Democrat\u2019s district as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live.\u201d The comments came weeks after Trump drew bipartisan condemnation following his calls for Democratic congresswomen of color to get out of the U.S. \u201cright now,\u201d and go back to their \u201cbroken and crime-infested countries.\u201d\n\nCummings replied that government officials must stop making \u201chateful, incendiary comments\u201d that distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.\n\n\u201cThose in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Trump tweeted his \u201ccondolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings.
