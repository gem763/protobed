Final fixtures and fittings are almost in and it is expected commissioning trials will get under way in the coming weeks.\n\nIts entry into service comes not a moment too soon.\n\nWednesday witnessed the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) special report on Earth's oceans and frozen regions.\n\nThis document paints a grim picture of rapid and accelerating losses from the ice sheets of both the far north and the far south.\n\nIt will be the job of the RRS Sir David Attenborough to go document the changes that are occurring and to help scientists work out how fast the melting will impinge on lower latitudes.\n\nAlready sea levels are rising globally by about 5mm per year (taken over the past five years), with ice losses at the poles now considered to be the major driver of this trend.\n\nBy the year 2100, according to some scenarios, the oceans could be 1.1m higher than they are now, which would pose a major challenge to the viability of many coastal settlements worldwide.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A three-year build: This is how the completed hull entered the water\n\nWhy does this ship matter?\n\nThe British Antarctic Survey, which has managed the UK's polar fleet, needs a modern platform from which to conduct world-leading research.\n\nImage caption There 750km of power and data cabling running through the ship\n\nThe chartered RRS Ernest Shackleton has already been returned to its owner; the RSS James Clark Ross will be let go very shortly, too.\n\nIt is the view of the funding agency, the Natural Environment Research Council, that the more advanced Attenborough can fulfil the tasks of both the earlier vessels - in research and in logistics. So, not only can its gear and labs do cutting-edge science, but it can carry numerous freight containers to resupply bases and expeditions in the field.\n\nHow special is the ship?\n\nIt is an icebreaker. There are different classes for this type of vessel but the specification says the Attenborough should be able to plough through 1m-thick sea ice at three knots (3.5mph/5.5km/h).\n\nThis will soon be tested when the ship is taken out on trials in the Arctic.\n\nThe Attenborough has a helipad (helicopters are essential), cranes and onboard labs, and it has the ability to deploy subs and other ocean survey and sampling equipment.\n\nImage copyright BAS Image caption Silent running: The ship is designed to run and make minimal noise\n\nOne of its key features is an enclosed \"moon pool\". This is essentially a huge hole running right through the middle of the hull. It will allow instruments to be lowered into - and recovered from - the sea when weather or dense sea-ice conditions would normally make such work very difficult.\n\nThe ship design, put together by Rolls-Royce, also enables near-silent running when required, meaning scientists can study sea creatures without disturbing them.\n\nWhat happened to the \"Boaty\" name?\n\nBoaty McBoatface lives on in the form of yellow submarines. The National Oceanography Centre in Southampton has several of these long-range autonomous underwater vehicles.\n\nWhen one of these is out on patrol, it carries the Boaty moniker.\n\nThe intention is that these Boaty-class subs will frequently operate from the Attenborough. They will be asked to go into places the ship itself cannot reach, such as under the colossal floating ice shelves that surround Antarctica.\n\nImage copyright P.Abrahamsen/BAS Image caption Boaty McBoatface: The submarines can go places the ship cannot\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will celebrate the introduction of the UK's new polar research vessel.", "authors": ["Jonathan Amos", "Bbc Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p9ljt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
