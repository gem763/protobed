But if the summit takes place at Trump's Florida property, it would mean he'd stand to personally benefit from one of the most important annual meetings of world leaders from the US, Canada, UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan.\n\nUnlike past presidents who put their assets in a blind trust, Trump has maintained ownership of his business empire \u2014 which is currently run by his two eldest sons \u2014 and critics have accused him of violating the Constitution by profiting off the presidency.\n\nThe foreign-emoluments clause of the Constitution bars public officials from receiving gifts or cash from foreign or state governments without congressional approval. Trump's DC hotel has been at the center of several lawsuits alleging Trump has violated the Constitution along these lines and has major conflicts of interest.\n\nAs Insider previously reported:\n\nTrump made at least $434 million in 2018, according to his annual financial disclosure, including $40.8 million from his hotel that's located less than a mile from the White House \u2014 Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC.\n\nA lobbying firm with ties to the Saudi government paid $270,000 to Trump's hotel in Washington between October 2016 and March 2017.\n\nTrump's financial disclosure for 2018 also revealed he earned roughly $22.7 million from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, a property where he's hosted foreign leaders and which has come under scrutiny on a variety of issues .\n\nAnd according to a recent analysis from The Washington Post, Trump's routine visits to his properties as president have brought his private businesses at least $1.6 million in revenue.", "description": "\"They love the location of the hotel,\" Trump said about his golf resort near Miami's airport during a bilateral meeting with German's chancellor.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d63eb422e22af071d1fc6f4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
