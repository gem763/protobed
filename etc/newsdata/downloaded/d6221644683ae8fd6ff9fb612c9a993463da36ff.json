(Dmitri Lovetsky, AP)\n\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague and his Russian colleague Alexey Ovchinin, who survived a dramatically aborted Soyuz launch last year, were due to blast off again to the International Space Station on Thursday.\n\nThe two men will be joined by US astronaut Christina Koch for lift-off from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 19:14 GMT.\n\nThe launch will be closely watched after the two men's space journey was cut short in October when a technical problem with their Soyuz rocket triggered a launch abort two minutes into the flight.\n\nBoth men escaped unharmed.\n\nIt was the first such accident in Russia's post-Soviet history and a major setback for its once proud space industry.\n\nSpeaking to reporters ahead of their six-month mission, flight commander Ovchinin said that some faulty components in the launch vehicle had been found and replaced this week.\n\n\"Yesterday they found some minor malfunctions,\" the 47-year-old said on Wednesday.\n\nHe insisted that the launch vehicle was in good shape.\n\n\"There are no problems,\" Ovchinin said.\n\nHague, 43, said he was looking forward to the flight \u2013 his second attempt to get into space.\n\n\"I'm 100% confident in the rocket and the spaceship,\" he said.\n\nThe October abort was caused by a sensor damaged during the rocket's assembly.\n\n'Old but reliable'\n\nSpace expert Vadim Lukashevich said last-minute replacements were nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n\"The Soyuz is an old but reliable machine,\" he told AFP.\n\nRussia's space industry has in recent years suffered a lot of mishaps including the loss of cargo spacecraft and numerous satellites.\n\nOvchinin, who spent six months at the ISS during a previous mission in 2016, has been keen to play down the drama of the October emergency landing.\n\nThe abort was \"a little disappointing\" after preparations that lasted a year-and-a-half but also \"an interesting and needed experience\" that tested the depth of the space programme's preparedness, he said.\n\nKoch, Hague and Ovchinin's six-hour flight on Thursday be closely watched for another reason too.\n\nSpaceX's successful test launch to the ISS of its Dragon vehicle has challenged an eight-year monopoly on travel to the space station enjoyed by Russia ever since NASA stopped launches of the Space Shuttle.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, the trio and their three-man backup crew stressed cooperation rather than competition following the Dragon mission, seen by some as the dawn of an era of commercial space travel driven by businessmen such as Elon Musk who owns SpaceX.\n\nKoch, a 40-year-old space rookie, called the SpaceX success a \"great example of what we've been doing for a very long time\".\n\n\"And that is cooperating among partners and making things that are very difficult look easy,\" she said.\n\n'First spacewalks'\n\nThere has already been one successful manned launch to the ISS since the failed Soyuz mission.\n\nThe trio's arrival will return the orbiting laboratory's crew to six in all.\n\nOleg Kononenko of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Anne McClain of NASA and David Saint-Jacques of the Canadian Space Agency blasted off to the orbiting outpost in December and are expected to greet their new crewmates early on Friday.\n\nDuruing their mission McClain, Saint-Jacques, Hague and Koch are set to perform the first spacewalks of their careers.\n\nThis week in a lighter moment Hague offered an insight into the specifics of personal grooming aboard the ISS.\n\n\"In space, we'll use clippers attached to a vacuum device so that the hair particles don't float around or get stuck in our vent systems,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe International Space Station \u2013 a rare area of cooperation between Moscow and Washington \u2013 has been orbiting the Earth at roughly 28 000km/h since 1998.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "NASA astronaut Nick Hague and his Russian colleague Alexey Ovchinin, who survived a dramatically aborted Soyuz launch last year, were due to blast off again to the International Space Station.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8632/c6c83bfd6bdd49069e612cdc1eb1ef6d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-15"}
