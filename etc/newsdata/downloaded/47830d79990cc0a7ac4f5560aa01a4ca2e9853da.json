Today's 64-page draft keeps a transition period up to 31 December 2020 but scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstop's place would effectively be 'two borders': Northern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - but EU customs rules will apply to goods entering Northern Ireland that are deemed \"at risk\" of moving into the EU at a later date.
