It didn\u2019t even get to number one, I never see anyone on my friends list playing it, and there generally seems to be no buzz around it. A bit like The Division 2, which makes me wonder whether the whole realistic military sim angle isn\u2019t making a come back after all. But then the hype around Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare seems to be real, so that can\u2019t be right.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the whole microtransaction, buggy launch angle that\u2019s put people off. If it is that it\u2019s taken a while and there\u2019s no obvious reason why it\u2019d be now rather than later, but I\u2019ll take it as a positive either way. I feel like these games as a service titles have reached a point now where there\u2019s just too many and people just can\u2019t keep up with them. And considering that\u2019s 90% of what Ubisoft do now they\u2019re essentially competing with themselves all the time.\n\nNot having a go at them specifically but it\u2019s weird that they\u2019ve gone all in on games as a service and everyone else seems to have been a lot more cautious (which seems sensible). I\u2019m curious to see whether they\u2019ll take one for the team on this, and prove that the party\u2019s over, or if they\u2019ll just carry on regardless. I could do with there being a few less endless, half-broken-at-launch, games going into the next generation.\n\nHammeriron\n\nGC: It doesn\u2019t seem to have made much of a splash but it\u2019s much too early to call it a flop. We know nothing about digital sales or how much money Ubisoft is making from it via microtransactions.", "description": "The Monday Inbox continues the Mega Drive vs. SNES debate, as another reader recommends Yooka-Laylee And The Impossible Lair.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fortnite-2eab_1571004312.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
