The soap has come on leaps and bounds of late by upping its character count of gay and lesbian characters and opening a gay bar in Walford. The episode in question which was awarded the prize was centred around Pride and included Bernie Taylor (Clair Norris) embarcing her sexuality and joining the festivities, a drag act performing on stage and Callum Highway (Tony Clay) battling with his own confusion.\n\nAccepting the award from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at the ceremony tonight, the episode\u2019s writer Pete Lawson said: \u201935 years ago, EastEnder started and I was 15. Watching TV when I was 15, there were no LGBT people on the mainstream.\n\n\u2018And I would have loved to have seen the life that was out there, that I knew was waiting for me.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPete was joined on stage by producer Jon Sen and actresses Luisa Bradshaw White and Clair Norris. The episode at the time was widely hailed for its inclusivity and spirit of fun and laughter, while also focusing on the struggle of a character not yet out.\n\nSInce then, the show has seen Callum stand up to his homophobic father Jonno before publicly kissing Ben Mitchell and embarking on a relationship with him. Iqra Ahmed also came out to her family and introduced her girlfriend Ash.\n\nKaty Beale opened The Prince Albert and the show has also confirmed that there will be a bisexual character.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "EastEnders has upped its representation.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18685485-high_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-9bcb_1571257683.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
