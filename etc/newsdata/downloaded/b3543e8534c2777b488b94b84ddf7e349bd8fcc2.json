On October 4, Morey tweeted, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately, Morey was thrown under the bus by the National Basketball Association (NBA) and several high-profile entities with strong business ties to the authoritarian Communist Party that has ruled China for the past seven decades. Apparently, the NBA and many U.S. corporations care much more about the almighty dollar than they do about trivial things such as human rights, freedom of speech, etc.\n\nChina, with a population of more than 1.3 billion people, is vastly larger than the U.S. population of about 330 million. And guess what? The Chinese are really into basketball. In fact, about 300 million Chinese play basketball. And 500 million Chinese fans tune into NBA games.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s official Twitter feed has more followers in China than in the United States, and the NBA (and several other U.S. corporations) sell an abundant amount of merchandise to the huge Chinese fan base.\n\nIn other words, China is still a relatively untapped market. And countless U.S. executives, including NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, are drooling all over themselves when it comes to receiving permission from Chinese officials to access the Chinese market.\n\nHowever, the Chinese communist government does not allow free and unfettered access to their highly valuable market. In other words, if you want to do business in China, you must play by the Communist rulers\u2019 rules.\n\nOf course, many of China\u2019s \u201crules\u201d are totally antithetical to America\u2019s founding principles. However, as Adam Silver and his NBA cronies have demonstrated in recent days, they are more than willing to throw these sacred principles to the wayside, as long as it allows them access to the Chinese money machine.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Well, consider the following.\n\nOn October 6, the Consulate-General of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Houston issued the following statement: \u201cWe are deeply shocked by the erroneous comments on Hong Kong made by Mr. Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets. We have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets, and urged the latter to correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact.\u201d\n\nThe NBA responded with, \u201cWe are extremely disappointed by the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, who has undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of our Chinese fans. Morey has now clarified that his comments do not represent the position of the Rockets or the NBA. \u2026 We have great respect for China\u2019s history and culture, and hope that sports and the NBA, can be used as positive energy for unity, and continue to be help build a bridge for international cultural exchanges and bring people together.\u201d\n\nShame on the NBA for issuing this pathetic apology. And when the NBA refers to its \u201cgreat respect for China\u2019s history and culture,\u201d does this include the horrendous human rights abuses that the Chinese communist government perpetrates every single day against its own citizens? Or was the NBA referencing China\u2019s recent history of mass slaughter?\n\nIn case you weren\u2019t aware, during the past 70 years, the Communist government of China is responsible for more deaths than Hitler or Stalin. In fact, R.J. Rummel, in his excellent book, China\u2019s Bloody Century, estimates that at least 40,000,000 Chinese have died through mass-murder, famine, forced labor, etc. during the communist era (1949 \u2013 today).\n\nUnfortunately, the NBA is doubling-down on its fealty to China. Shockingly, at a recent NBA pre-season game between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Guangzhou Loong Lions (a Chinese team) in Philadelphia (the very birthplace of American independence), two fans were ejected for possessing signs supporting Hong Kong inside the Wells Fargo Arena.\n\nMaybe the NBA should take a page from Comedy Central\u2019s South Park \u201cplaybook.\u201d On October 2, a South Park episode titled \u201cBand in China\u201d hit the airwaves. The episode mocked the Chinese government and U.S. corporations that bow to China while ignoring the very dark side of its communist regime.\n\nOf course, the Chinese government responded by banning South Park, literally erasing it from existence. Sort of like the Soviet Union\u2019s predilection for \u201cerasing\u201d anyone or anything that was not in line with the Communist party doctrine.\n\nHowever, South Park, unlike the NBA, refused to cater to the Chinese communists. According to South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, \u201cLike the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t look like Winnie the Pooh at all. \u2026 Long live the Great Communist Party of China.\u201d\n\nIn case you were wondering, Winnie the Pooh, like South Park, is actually banned in China because Chinese bloggers had the temerity to say China\u2019s President Xi looks like Winnie the Pooh, which he certainly does. What next, an all-out ban on Tigger?\n\nShamelessly, the NBA is more enamored with making money in China than respecting the First Amendment rights of its own fans in America or standing up for American values. Although I am not usually one for boycotts, you can bet your bottom dollar that I will pay much less attention to the NBA this season (while continuing to watch South Park each and every week). I have a sneaking suspicion many more Americans will do the same.", "description": "In case you have been living under a rock the .10/11/2019 1:07:01AM EST.", "authors": ["Chris Talgo", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/280/2bae53a7-a3d7-47b1-b1e2-8929bb93ffbf.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
