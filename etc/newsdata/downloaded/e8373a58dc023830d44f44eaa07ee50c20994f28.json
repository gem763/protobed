Parkinson also chairs on the board for the organisation, which is a Christian legal \u2018think-tank\u2019, according to 10 Daily.\n\nThe paper, entitled \u201cIs Gender Identity Discrimination a Religious Freedom Issue?\u201d, consisted of Parkinson\u2019s arguments for religious schools being able to ignore students \u2018new\u2019 gender identity during or following transitioning. Effectively discriminating against said students about an issue that has absolutely nothing to do with their formal education.\n\n\u201cIt is one thing to ask me to respect your beliefs. It is another to ask me to act towards you as if I share your beliefs about you,\u201d Parkinson said.\n\nParkinson likened the acceptance of a student\u2019s preferred pronouns and gender identification to affirming an \u201coverweight\u201d image to a teenager suffering from an eating disorder.\n\n\u201c[A] crisis of conscience may arise from a genuine belief that it is not in the best interests of the child or young person to affirm his or her transgender identification, any more than it would be in the best interests of an adolescent girl with an eating disorder to affirm her body image as overweight,\u201d Parkinson said in the paper.\n\nThroughout his speech, Parkinson also argued that he wanted more clarification of the religious discrimination act that was released last month. You know, that fucked piece of legislation that effectively means that doctors can refuse to treat LGBTQI+ patients on the grounds of religion. Yeah, that one.\n\nRemember, you can still voice your opinion on that bill, so go do that now if you haven\u2019t already.\n\n\u201cSex, or what it means to be male or female, needs to be defined in terms of reproductive function while gender identity can be defined in terms of subjective belief,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018Such clarification in the law would go a long way to resolving the dilemmas now being created by laws which base changes to gender identity on nothing more than self-declaration,\u201d Parkinson added.\n\nAlthough the Dean cares more about his right to religious freedom than the right that students have to an education without fear of discrimination or hate speech, many of his colleagues have come out in support of the LGBTQI+ community.\n\nSo far, at least 37 faculty members from the TC Beirne School of Law have offered their support to the trans and wider LGBTQI+ community within the school in an open letter.\n\nI will do whatever I can to support #LGBTIAQ+ members of the @UQLaw and wider #UQ community. I am privileged to work with colleagues who share this commitment to diversity and inclusion pic.twitter.com/Eg2od3Sph8 \u2014 Rain Liivoja (@RainLiivoja) September 17, 2019\n\n\u201cAs staff committed to diversity and inclusion, we want to affirm our support to transgender and gender diverse students. We will use their preferred names and personal pronouns. We are here to listen,\u201d the letter read.\n\nThe University of Queensland Law Society has also come out with a statement in support of the trans community within the school, condemning Parkinson\u2019s comments that \u201care not reflective of the inclusive culture\u201d of the school.\n\nWhile the open letter from staff didn\u2019t directly reference Parkinson\u2019s comments, the signatories mentioned their dedication to \u201ccreating an educational environment where everyone is welcome.\u201d\n\nFollowing the open letter, Parkinson told the Guardian that he supported the statement made by his colleagues and has \u201ca very strong commitment to diversity and inclusion within the law school.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not matter in the slightest what someone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity is either for the study or practice of law. As law school staff, we are unanimous in that view, and it is the clear policy of the university.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure how you can be committed to inclusivity and diversity while also blatantly choosing not to support trans students preferred pronouns and gender identification.\n\nRemember folks, your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins.", "description": "Staff of the University of Queensland have rallied in support of the LGBTQI+ community after the Dean penned a transphobic religious paper.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1168617365.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
