Who has been found guilty of breaking the law, unlawfully proroguing parliament. And so he has proved time and again that he simply cannot be trusted.\n\n\u201cLiberal Democrats will be working with and talking with people across the different parties to find a way to remove that threat of a no-deal Brexit more quickly. It\u2019s vital we do this for our country\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nMPs have flocked back to parliament after the supreme court ruled that Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension was unlawful.\n\nTimeline The plan to prorogue parliament and the court cases against it Show Hide\n\nThe story breaks The Observer breaks the story that Boris Johnson has sought legal advice on closing parliament for five weeks Leaks spread Other media organisations begin to receive leaks that Johnson will make a statement on prorogation Visit to Balmoral Three privy counsellors, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, travel to Balmoral to tell the Queen of the prorogation plan.

Gina Miller case fails Legal campaigner Gina Miller vows to continue her \u201cfight for democracy\u201d after the high court dismissed her claim that the prime minister acted unlawfully in giving advice to the Queen to suspend parliament at a time of momentous political upheaval. Parliament dissolved Parliament is dissolved amid chaotic scenes as some MPs hold up signs saying they have been silenced, try to prevent Speaker John Bercow leaving the chamber, and sing the Red Flag. Scottish court ruling The court of session in Scotland rules that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was unlawful. The case will go to the supreme court. Supreme court hearing The Supreme court begins three-day hearing to join together all the appeals and legal challenges to the prorogation. Supreme court finds prorogation was unlawful The judges unanimously decided that prorogation was justiciable, and it was in the power of the court to rule on it. They additionally found that the prorogation was unlawful, as it had the effect of preventing parliament from being able to carry out its constitutional functions. The court found that the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful, void and of no effect. Their unanimous judgement was that parliament had not been prorogued. Parliament goes back to work.\n\nIt is understood opposition parties could seek to amend the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019 which was introduced by the Labour MP and chair of the Brexit select committee, Hilary Benn, and passed earlier this month.\n\nThe bill gives Johnson until 19 October to either pass a deal in parliament or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit. If he fails to do either then he will be forced to ask for an extension to the UK\u2019s departure date from 31 October to 31 January 2020.\n\nWith no working majority in parliament, MPs are emboldened to try to use their numbers and legislative tactics to force Johnson to act.\n\nThe shadow cabinet met on Wednesday morning to consider Labour\u2019s tactics.\n\nJeremy Corbyn is keen to secure a general election as soon as possible, once the threat of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has been definitively ruled out \u2013 though some Labour MPs would prefer a referendum to be held first.\n\nIf an extension is requested and agreed before 19 October, Labour would then be likely to support a general election. Corbyn gave a rousing speech at Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton on Tuesday, urging party activists to \u201cgo forward to win an election for the people of this country\u201d.\n\nSwinson said: \u201cThere\u2019s various different ways we can do this and I think if anything has been shown in the last few weeks and months it\u2019s that parliament can be innovative and inventive.\n\n\u201cWe saw in September the House of Commons take control of the order paper to pass a piece of legislation and that\u2019s the type of way forward that may well enable us to take the threat of a no-deal Brexit off the table much sooner than 19 October.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit crisis: what is the state of play between the parties?
