It is the absolute worst. Sure, you could avoid skimming scum entirely by using a slow cooker, but if you\u2019re stuck with the stove, there\u2019s a simple way to make the worst part of stock making suck a lot less.\n\nSkimming meat scum off the broth itself actually isn\u2019t too bad \u2014 but once it\u2019s coated every single square inch of your other ingredients, you\u2019re in for a bad time. To get around this, all you have to do to is leave your spices, aromatics and vegetables out of the pot until the meat stops exuding scum and you\u2019ve skimmed it all off. That\u2019s it.\n\nI learned this from the very first episode of Matty Matheson\u2019s new YouTube cooking show, Just a Dash, in which he makes a vat of oxtail pho. Here\u2019s how Matty puts it:\n\nMy usual stovetop stock procedure is basically \u201cchuck everything in at once, half-arse the skimming, and hope for the best,\u201d so seeing this technique in action was a serious lightbulb moment.\n\nOf course you should keep the meat and veg separate until the scum has been skimmed \u2014 the fewer ingredients there are in the pot, the less surface area there is for that scum to glom onto. It\u2019s so obvious now that I\u2019m actually mad I spent so many years doing it the wrong way.\n\nDon\u2019t repeat my mistakes: always skim off every last bit of stock scum before adding a single vegetable to the pot. Your life will be much easier.", "description": "Making meat stock on the stove necessitates standing over a boiling hot pot, scooping weird congealed meat scum off the surface.
