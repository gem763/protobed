Kim Soon-rye of the Liberty Korea Party on Tuesday during the National Assembly\u2019s inspection of the National Medical Center.According to the data collected by her office, problems were discovered with 38 patients who were operated on by a neurosurgeon of the medical center between 2015 and 2018. According to the lawmaker, 28 patients died within three days of the operations.\u201cMost of the patients were homeless people, and 22 of them were actually brain-dead or near brain-dead at the time of the surgeries,\u201d an aide to Rep. Kim said. \u201cConsent forms showed that 10 surgeries were authorized by using patients\u2019 thumbprints, suspected to have been collected while they were unconscious. And the doctor did not order postoperative CT (computed tomography) scans on 17 patients.\u201dPerforming the surgeries using the patients\u2019 thumbprints as consent is against the law, a professor of neurosurgery at a national university hospital said. \u201cThere can be some exceptions, but the principle is that we need the patient\u2019s signature,\u201d he said.\u201cIf a patient is brain-dead for sure, performing a surgery is meaningless,\u201d said the professor. \u201cIt is a routine procedure to order a postoperative CT scan of the brain after the surgery, but he didn\u2019t. That means the patient was irrecoverable.\u201dAccording to the lawmaker, the doctor performed surgeries on five different patients that each took less than one hour. The average time span for brain surgery is about five to six hours.Kim\u2019s office said the doctor spent one to two hours each on 12 patients and two to three hours on four others.On an emergency patient who arrived at the hospital in August 2016, the doctor performed a late night surgery and used a new bypass technique. Four minutes after the operation, he posted a photo of the patient\u2019s open skull on his social network account. According to Kim\u2019s office, the patient died 34 hours after the surgery.\u201cThe doctor appeared to have practiced his surgical skills on patients,\u201d said an official well-informed about the affairs of the National Medical Center. \u201cOther doctors tried to stop him, but he went ahead and performed surgeries in some cases. Because many of his patients did not have families or were poor, no one really raised an issue.\u201dInsisting that there was no ethical breach for his surgical operations, the doctor said 38 cases out of hundreds were picked out and scrutinized. \u201cBut it was my fault that I posted the photo of a patient\u2019s brain without consent,\u201d he said.The doctor defended his actions. \u201cWe have many urgent care patients, so we have no luxury to see who is brain-dead or not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to perform surgery first. Treatments won\u2019t be different whether the patient is homeless or has a family or not.\u201d\u201cWhen the patient\u2019s family is not contacted despite urgent conditions, we just have to perform the surgery using their thumbprint on a consent form,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the surgery time is naturally short, because we have to rush when a patient is critical.\u201dThe case was revealed when a whistle-blower made a report to the Anti-corruption & Civil Rights Commission in August this year and the commission informed the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the case last month.Rep. Kim argued that Chung Ki-hyun, president and CEO of the National Medical Center, had been aware of the scandalous practice of the doctor. \u201cA doctors\u2019 organization informed Chung about the case in May, but he dismissed it as slander against the doctor,\u201d Kim said. \u201cAnd the neurosurgeon is still actively practicing medicine at the hospital.\u201dThe whistle-blower then filed a petition to the prosecution to investigate Chung early this month for suspected dereliction of duty.At the National Assembly inspection on Tuesday, Chung said the ministry, a direct supervisor of the hospital, did not order any investigation. \u201cBecause we have limits to conduct our own internal probe, we asked for outside expert help,\u201d he said.\u201cAn investigation must take place to thoroughly probe whether the patients actually required open-skull brain surgeries and if the doctor performed proper surgeries and offered proper care to the patients after the operations,\u201d said Professor Kim So-yoon, director of Medical Law and Ethics Division of the Yonsei University\u2019s College of Medicine.BY JEONG JONG-HUN [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
