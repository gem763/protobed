Her new album is called Sexorcism, featuring tracks like \u201cCum\u201d and \u201cRim.\u201d On the cover, she\u2019s showing off six tattooed breasts. For her recent verse on Charli XCX\u2019s \u201cShake It,\u201d she compares her ass-shaking to the Richter scale and says her \u201cpussy crucify your body,\u201d whatever that could mean.\n\nYet when Candy (her real last name; her father is former Hustler magazine CFO Tom Candy) was in England recently and saw an episode of Naked Attraction, the BBC dating show where a contestant sees their potential suitors naked, she \u201cwas fucking shook.\u201d \u201cYou just see, fucking, a dick on TV,\u201d she explains. \u201cI was like, Why am I blushing? Look at the album that I\u2019m about to put out!\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s had to dodge several obstacles to get here. In 2013 she told New York she had plans for an independent debut at the time, then pushed those plans back to sign with RCA Records the following year. She released an EP called Opulence and got Sia on board to executive-produce her album, set to be called Daddy Issues. But it kept getting delayed until 2017, when Candy left RCA, which she attributes to the label being opposed to her sexual lyrics.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, she recorded a whole new album over just four days, on her own terms. That\u2019s Sexorcism, her proper debut. \u201cWhen you stifle me this much, then you get this kind of an album,\u201d Candy explains. \u201cJust let me be creative.\u201d Trust her, she won\u2019t give up \u2014 she didn\u2019t with Naked Attraction either. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d she admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t turn it off.\u201d\n\nHow does it feel for you to know that your debut album is finally going to be out in the world?\n\nWhen I announced it, Lizzo left me a comment where she\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re about to give birth.\u201d It does [feel like that], like it\u2019s been gestating for months. And by the time it\u2019s out, you\u2019ve already really lived through the music, but this one really came quick. It doesn\u2019t feel like I made it and then I had to wait five years to put it out. But I don\u2019t really think about how it feels. I made a body of work that is beyond just me. And it\u2019s just a fun body of work. It\u2019s not meant to be taken too seriously, and there\u2019s not too much deep meaning. I mean, there\u2019s some feminist anthem moments on there, and it\u2019s very queer, it\u2019s very sexual, but it\u2019s fun. And it\u2019s cool that I got to make this project that\u2019s fun.\n\nI read something a few years ago where the writer was saying that it seems like you\u2019re moving toward not rapping about sex as much. Was that ever a thought for you?\n\n\ufeffOh, that was a reality for me when I was signed to RCA. I fought, bare-fucking knuckle, to get the fuck out of that, so that I could just make what I wanted. As someone who actually needs to make art to survive, it\u2019s a bit stifling to have your identity ripped from you. I was being dictated what I could and couldn\u2019t say, what I could and couldn\u2019t do. I\u2019m a highly sexually charged person, and I believe in sexual liberation for all human beings, especially for women, and so, no. I made sure that was short-lived. Subconsciously, I just knew that nothing could shut me up. All artists should have creative freedom. Otherwise, they\u2019re not artists; they\u2019re just vehicles. And I\u2019m not that.\n\nHas it gotten easier to convince people, or the labels, the value of making music about sex?\n\nThat\u2019s the reason why I started making music. I was shamed for doing something that I didn\u2019t know was wrong and isn\u2019t wrong. But I was told it was wrong. It lit a fire under my ass and the way that I chose to do something about it was by making a song, to let the person who is shaming me know in the best way I knew how, which was by rapping it, over a beat. I respect and admire and applaud any artist that is owning their sexuality, being true and their highest inter-dimensional self. And if your best self is a highly sexually charged person who loves to rap about rimming like me? Fuck yeah, do your thing.\n\nHow did you first learn how to rap?\n\nI remember sitting down in my mom\u2019s apartment \u2014 we used to share a one-bedroom apartment, we literally shared a bed for a while. I had just moved back from San Francisco. I was young, and this is right when I just started, and I remember playing Lil\u2019 Kim, what is it? \u201cIf Peter Piper pecked \u2019em, I betcha Biggie bust \u2019em / He probably tried to fuck \u2019em, I told him not to trust \u2019em / Lyrically I dust \u2019em off like Pledge / hit hard like sledgehammers.\u201d So I sat at home and I just learned \u201cQueen Bitch,\u201d and I just tried to imitate that as much as I could. I was young, and I just wanted to get out, and she just made me feel tough.\n\nI want to go through a few of the features on the album, starting with the single with Rico Nasty, \u201cFMU.\u201d It seems like your two styles really mesh together well. What was working with her like?\n\nWe actually were brought together by [producer] Boys Noize. He was like, \u201cWhat do you think about a feature?\u201d And then the next thing I know, I got a photo of him and Rico in the studio, and they were both giving me the thumbs-up, and it was like, \u201cHey!\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI got invited, a week before I made that song, to go to an all-female biker meet-up in Bend, Oregon. We just meet in the woods, and we camp and dance naked and drink or do whatever you want to do. I hung out with a group of 75-year-old women that were in a biker gang, that was my crew. But that was happening at the same time that this collaboration was happening, so [\u201cFMU\u201d] feels like it\u2019s this tough, cool feminist anthem, and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a fucking more tough, cool, strong woman to do it with. Rico Nasty is kind of saving rap music in the same way that I think Charli XCX and Lizzo are saving pop music.\n\nThat\u2019s great. And it was interesting to see Drag Race\u2019s Aquaria and Violet Chachki on \u201cRim.\u201d Why the two of them?\n\n\ufeffAquaria and Violet are just so chic. They are stunning and they just inspire me to want to be more glamorous. I was like, this song is nasty, who\u2019s really fucking glamorous and who\u2019s really fucking nasty? And they both came to mind. I\u2019m currently attempting to get a remix together with \u2014 I\u2019m just gonna say it, I don\u2019t care \u2014 Bob the Drag Queen and Detox. Because I started to think, who could be even nastier? Like, Bob is so fucking funny, and Detox performs Nine Inch Nails\u2019 \u201cCloser\u201d and sticks a cigarette in her nose, and then exhales out her mouth, and then takes her fucking heel off and licks the heel after walking around on like a dirty club floor. Yes, the two of you are the ones.\n\nThat would be so fun. So in the past few years you\u2019ve gotten sober, you just got married, and you turned 30 as well. Do you think it shocks people to find that out, and then to hear your music?\n\n\ufeffI think I\u2019m shocked if anyone actually gives a shit about my life at all. I could see how it could be a bizarre twist, but then in reality it\u2019s like, the wedding ceremony was done by my gay best friend, and he married us under the Church of Space and Time. And it was time for me to get sober, \u2019cause I was a crazy human being. And I still have crazy sex.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019ll make whatever art I feel like I have to make when I make it, and then whoever likes it likes it, and then whoever doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t, and then I\u2019ve made it, so I\u2019ve expressed myself and I can move on. That\u2019s really it for me.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "Brooke Candy on her new album, Sexorcism, being too raunchy for record labels, and working with Drag Race\u2019s Aquaria and Violet Chachki", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/25/25-brooke-candy-chat-room.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
