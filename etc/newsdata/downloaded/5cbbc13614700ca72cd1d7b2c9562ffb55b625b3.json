But on Sunday it was time to stop and remember.\n\nJapan's fans were deafening as they saw their team qualify for the World Cup quarter-finals\n\nSpectators undertook a minute's silence for the victims of Typhoon Hagibis prior to the game\n\nThen came the noise - deafening and unrelenting in the aftermath of tragedy.\n\nWhen Japan awoke on Sunday, it was unclear whether this game would even take place. Come kick-off, nearly 70,000 supporters were in for the ride.\n\nThe home side's pulsating victory was the perfect climax to all the uncertainty.\n\n'Many people in Japan received the hazard (warnings during the typhoon) but they can see this game and the players can encourage the people,' says fan Wataru Ota.\n\n'I hope every Japanese person sees this game and is united and motivated.'\n\nIn contrast, this proved a dark night for Scotland. For fans such as John Reilly, however, even defeat is better than another day without rugby.\n\nVictory for Japan sees them get past the group stage for the first time in their history\n\nFans dressed in all sorts of colourful costumes to get into the spirit of the game in Yokohama\n\nHe came here for England's cancelled clash with France and Saturday night's epic.\n\n'I had kittens that it wasn't going to take place,' he says. 'The Japanese have been absolutely fantastic... I'm so glad they're playing tonight.\n\n'I'd rather we lost and get beaten in a match than (go out) on bonus points.'\n\nAway from the bright lights, stadium staff worked doggedly to make this night so special.\n\nThat there were so few scars of the typhoon owes much to this country's rapidly changing weather - and the spirit of its people.\n\nA Tokyo fanzone saw scores of fans gather to watch the exciting match against Scotland\n\nJapan fans stayed after the game in Yokohama to pay tribute to their victorious players\n\nIn the early hours one local was seen clearing debris and staff continued the cleaning operation before a World Rugby even announced the game was on.\n\nBy late afternoon the area surrounding the ground was spotless.\n\nThere were also warnings that merchandise, food and drink stalls would be hampered by the storm but everyone made do. Fans were allowed to bring their own soft drinks. Many came with food, too.\n\nBeers were available from inside a makeshift tarpaulin tent, while the youngsters carrying mobile Heineken taps did their best to raise spirits. The Japan players did the rest.", "description": "DANIEL MATTHEWS IN YOKOHAMA: Japan reached the quarter finals of the Rugby World Cup with victory over Scotland.
