In August, Tiffany reported quarterly earnings that also beat analysts' expectations, thanks to a drop in marketing costs.\n\nTiffany has been refreshing its offerings with more affordable items such as pendants and earrings, to appeal to millennials who have been gravitating to lower-priced competitors such as Denmark's Pandora A/S and Signet Jewelers.\n\nParis-headquartered LVMH is controlled by the Arnault family and is led by Bernard Arnault, France's richest man.
