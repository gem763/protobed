I got a sense of what had happened at the site I had been to so many times, and also got to feel the deep loss and pain of the day through the writings of people that had lived through it and remembered it. I\u2019ll never forget reading through the online tribute pages where loved ones and strangers wrote their messages for my mother years before. I looked at old photos of her and learned more about her life; I got to see her as Jill Maurer-Campbell, the childhood dancer, world traveler and caring, loving person. My family and this tragedy were intertwined.\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2014, I received hard news. My grandfather, retired Fire Department Capt. Joseph Maurer, had been battling esophageal cancer, which was caused by his trips to Lower Manhattan after the attacks. While retired, he ventured down to the site multiple times with his old pals to search for his lost daughter and Fire Department brothers, and to help in any way he could.\n\nSeven months into his fight he had begun losing a lot of weight. That morning, he\u2019d gone to the doctor, who told him that his cancer was terminal. After my grandmother told me the news, I looked into the living room and saw that one couch was missing. A man was putting together a hospital bed. My grandfather sat on a box nearby, his head in his hands. I had a semi-normal life before with a supporting and loving family. Now Sept. 11 was back for someone else.\n\nHe died just five days later. That is the first time I struggled emotionally with what had happened. I developed insomnia and depression. I felt as if life was ugly and that I couldn\u2019t really deal with it. Missing my grandpa made me finally realize how much I had missed with my mom.\n\nIn the past year or so, since I started college, I forced myself to come face to face with what happened. I watched \u201c9/11,\u201d the documentary made by Jules and G\u00e9d\u00e9on Naudet. I read more books, like \u201cThe Only Plane in the Sky,\u201d Garrett M. Graff\u2019s oral history of the attacks, which a friend gave me an early copy of. I didn\u2019t hold back from seeing the event as it was. Watching footage from that day and knowing that my mom was inside the building was gut wrenching, but it helped me face reality, and my emotions. I also saw the heroism of so many people.\n\nRemarkably, I even got to know one of these heroes. In 2018, during my first semester in college, I read \u201cThe Operator,\u201d the memoir in which Rob O\u2019Neill, a member of SEAL Team Six, writes that he fired the shots that killed bin Laden. I was so moved that I sent an email to the author, not necessarily expecting a response. He wrote back and invited me to spend time with him while he was in Detroit for a talk about his book. One day in December, after I took a final exam, I went to Detroit. I stood on line to get my paperback copy of \u201cThe Operator\u201d signed. As I waited, I remembered that night in fifth grade and the looks on my family members\u2019 faces.\n\nFor most people, he signed his name on a blank page. But after I told him who I was, he wrote underneath his signature: \u201cTo the victims of 9/11 \u2026. in memory of you that I fought.\u201d", "description": "It has been years of healing \u2014 for me, and for America.", "authors": ["Jacob Campbell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/opinion/11campbellNew/11campbellNew-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
