Gerke said he wouldn't give the mass shooter additional notoriety.\n\nThe shooter was later named in a Facebook post by the Odessa Police Department.\n\nThe incident began when a gold-colored car was stopped by a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper for failing to signal.\n\nPolice say the shooter grabbed a rifle and shot at a pair of troopers through the rear-view window \u2013 wounding one \u2013 before driving away. He then sped off and continued his rampage, firing at motorists and pedestrians before hijacking a U.S. Postal Service truck.\n\nThe shooter was killed after being chased by officers from neighboring cities Midland and Odessa.\n\nLaw enforcement officials investigate an area Sunday at Loop 338 and Highway 191 in Odessa, Texas after a shooting spree left several people injured or killed Saturday, Aug. 31, 2019. More\n\nAt the news conference, Gerke confirmed seven people had died with the victims ranging in age from 15 to 57.\n\n\"Very sincerely I say to those families I offer my apologies and my condolences,\" Gerke said.\n\nShooting in Odessa-Midland: Death toll rises to seven in Texas shooting rampage; shooter identified\n\nWhat we know: 7 dead, 22 injured in Odessa, Midland, Texas shooting: Here's what we know now\n\nGerke said investigators are still researching potential motives for the shooting, but said law enforcement is confident that only one shooter was involved. Initial reports from law enforcement on social media suggested the possibility of a second shooter. Gerke credited the confusion to the shooter switching vehicles.\n\nOfficials claim the shooter used an \"AR-style\" weapon \u2013 probably referring to the AR-15 assault rifle often used in mass shootings \u2013 but didn't know how the shooter obtained it or whether it was a legal transaction.\n\nBackground on the shooter\n\nSaturday's mass shooting was not Ator's only encounter with law enforcement.\n\nRecords from McLennan County Court in Waco, Texas, show Ator was arrested Aug. 3, 2001, for trespassing and evading arrest \u2013 both misdemeanors \u2013 to which Ator pleaded guilty in February 2002. He was sentenced to two years of \"court probation.\" It's not clear what restrictions that probation entailed.\n\nThe massacre is the latest in a string of mass shootings in the last few months: Dayton, Ohio; Gilroy, California; and El Paso, Texas.\n\nAtor doesn't have much of a digital footprint on first glance. Searches under his name yield few results on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nPublic records list Ator's address in Lorena, Texas \u2013 a small city with a population of roughly 1,800 people, according to census data. The city is approximately 300 miles east of Odessa-Midland.\n\nVideo: 'They're shooting right there': Eyewitness video shows Odessa, Midland, Texas shooting\n\nInjured: 17-month-old girl is one of the victims hospitalized after Odessa shooting\n\nRecords also suggest Ator attended Texas State Technical College in Waco, Texas, in 2005. Ator also appears to have attended McLennan Community College \u2013 also in Waco \u2013 between 2007 and 2013.\n\nFollow Perry Vandell on Twitter: @PerryVandell\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Texas shooting: Seth Ator, 36, identified as gunman", "description": "Police refused to release the gunman's identity in the shooting in Odessa and Midland, Texas, so as not to give him additional notoriety.", "authors": ["Perry Vandell", "Arizona Republic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6w84slFEMgIHCO2.J2EoZw--~B/aD0yNDIxO3c9MzYzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/9b57850cdeb9047ab0753644581b01d7"}
