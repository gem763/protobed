'It's pretty bad.'\n\nMeanwhile 1.5million people suffered through another night without electricity on Wednesday, at least 1million of whom haven't had power for four days.\n\nAnger was mounting at Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility company, after it cut the supply Tuesday in order to stop branches being blown on to power lines, or lines being brought down on to tinder-dry ground, causing the blazes.\n\nSanta Ana winds with speeds of up to 70mph are expected to hit southern California on Wednesday, fanning the flames of wildfires already in progress and sparking new ones (pictured, crews battle the Kincade fire near San Francisco)\n\nForecasters have issued a rare extreme red flag warning for wildfires in the south of the state, saying the risk of blazes remains very high\n\nPacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility company, announced Tuesday it was cutting power to 1.5million people amid fears downed or damaged lines could cause blazes\n\nAmong those venting their frustration was chef and caterer Jane Sykes, who was forced to throw out $1,000 worth of food, including trays of brownies, cupcakes and puff pastry.\n\nShe also had little hope of getting a good night's sleep - there was no way to run the machine she relies on to counter her apnea.\n\n'I don't think PG&E really thought this through,' she lamented.\n\nPG&E officials said they understood the hardships caused by the safety blackouts but continued to insist they were necessary.\n\nWinds blowing westward off the desert and mountains into Los Angeles and Orange County are expected to reach sustained speeds of 50-to-70 mph Wednesday and into Thursday.\n\nFirefighters got ready to do battle again after a day of light breezes that helped them gain ground against a blaze displacing thousands of Los Angeles residents near the Getty Center museum.\n\nA meteor streaks across the sky as gusty winds create an ember cast on a valley oak tree burned by the Kincade fire, early Wednesday morning\n\nCalifornia braced Wednesday for the most powerful winds this season that threaten to spread destructive fires raging in the state and could spark new blazes\n\nStrike teams and equipment were posted on standby at strategic points throughout the state.\n\nCity arson investigators said on Tuesday the Getty fire was likely to have been caused by a broken tree branch being blown into power lines during high winds on Monday morning.\n\nThe NWS's Storm Prediction Center said that a critical or extreme fire danger existed for more than 34,000 square miles of California, encompassing some 21 million people.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom, who has accused utilities of failing to adequately modernize and safely maintain their power systems, paid a visit to the Getty fire zone on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n'This is a challenging time,' Newsom told reporters at a command center in the University of California's Los Angeles campus.\n\nAt the start of the day, firefighters in Los Angeles and those battling a much larger conflagration in northern California's Sonoma County wine country took advantage of lighter winds to make headway before hazardous winds reemerged.\n\nFirefighters put out hot spots from the Kincade Fire on Wednesday in Calistoga, California\n\nPowerful Santa Ana winds, also known as Devil Winds, have been causing fires by blowing tree branches on to power lines, or bringing the lines down directly on to dry wood\n\nFirefighters were given a brief bit of respite on Tuesday as the winds eased, but they were expected to pick up again to season-high speeds Wednesday\n\nFire officials worried that high winds forecast to gust to 70 miles (113 km) per hour or more would lift embers from smoldering hot spots and carry them into unburned vegetation, re-igniting and spreading flames anew.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said extremely high winds could also force water-dropping helicopters, a vital component of the firefighting arsenal, to be grounded.\n\nAn army of some 1,100 firefighters battled the Getty fire Tuesday in a narrow window of slower winds and consolidated those gains a day after flames and embers spread over scrub-covered slopes around expensive homes on the city's west side.\n\nBy early Wednesday, crews had managed to confine the blaze to about 650 acres (263 hectares) while carving solid containment lines around 15% of its perimeter.\n\nAnnouncing preliminary findings of its Getty fire investigation, the Los Angeles Fire Department said the blaze probably started when a tree branch snapped off in high winds landed on power lines, producing sparks and 'arcing' that ignited nearby brush.\n\nThe lines, which are operated by the city's Department of Water and Power (DWP), remained intact, the statement said.\n\nPG&E has been implicated in the Sonoma County blaze, dubbed the Kincade fire. The utility acknowledged last week that the Kincade fire broke out near a damaged PG&E transmission tower at about the time a live high-voltage line carried by that tower malfunctioned.\n\nThe company, whose mass power shutdowns have drawn harsh criticism from the governor, filed for bankruptcy in January, citing $30 billion in potential liability from a series of deadly fires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018.\n\nCiting progress made against the Kincade fire, Newsom said the number of evacuees in northern California had diminished from 190,000 at the peak of that blaze to 130,000 on Tuesday.\n\nProperty losses from the Kincade, listed at 15% contained, were put at 189 homes and other structures, double Monday's tally.\n\nFueled by high winds, the Kincade Fire has burned over 76,000 acres and has prompted nearly 200,000 evacuations in Sonoma County and beyond\n\nNational Guard troops monitor a road closure along the south side of the Kinkade Fire in Santa Rosa, California\n\nThe size of the Getty fire's evacuation zone was reduced by roughly 3,000 homes on Tuesday but residents of about 7,000 dwellings remained displaced, fire officials said. At least a dozen homes have been destroyed so far.\n\nSouthern California Edison, which had previously made safety shutoffs and then restored power, warned that it could black out more than 300,000 customers, or some 600,000 people.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Edison announced in a quarterly earnings report that it was 'likely' its equipment caused last year's Woolsey Fire, which killed three people and destroyed hundreds of homes in a swatch stretching from north of Los Angeles south through Malibu to the sea.\n\nNo deaths were reported from the current fires but weekend gusts may have claimed three lives. A 55-year-old homeless woman was crushed by a falling tree during high winds Sunday at a Santa Cruz campsite and a couple was killed the same day in a remote area of Madera County when a tree fell on their Jeep, which then crashed.\n\nAcross Northern California, people who weren't facing another day as fire refugees were worried about charging cellphones and electric vehicles, finding gasoline and cash, staying warm and keeping their food from spoiling.\n\nSome ended up at centers set up by PG&E where people could go to power their electronics and get free water, snacks, flashlights and solar lanterns.\n\nIn total, the Kincade Fire has destroyed 96 structures with nearly 80,000 homes still threatened. The fire is just 15 per cent contained\n\nA firefighter looks at his phone while others talk in the parking lot of an evacuated shopping center while they await their next assignment in battling the Kincade Fire in Santa Rosa\n\nAlex DeLeon with Engine 342 of the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the US Forest Service watches the Kincade fire burn on a ridge between Lake and Sonoma Counties\n\nIn Placer County, Angel Smith relied on baby wipes and blankets to keep her 13-month-old son Liam warm and clean. The family has been without power since Saturday night and cannot draw well water without electricity.\n\nShe ran a cord from her neighbors' generator to keep her phone and tablet charged so the two could watch movies. Temperatures were expected to drop below freezing overnight in parts of Northern California.\n\n'The hardest part about this for me has been making sure I keep my son warm as it gets cold here,' Smith said.\n\nPG&E, which is in bankruptcy after its equipment was blamed for a string of disastrous fires over the past three years, including a blaze that all but destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people, has said its foremost concern is public safety.\n\nBut Gov. Gavin Newsom and top utility regulators have accused the company of mismanaging its power system and failing for decades to make the investments needed to ensure it's more durable. He and others have also complained that the utility has botched the outages by not keeping the public adequately informed.\n\nPG&E Corp. President Bill Johnson says he talked to Newsom Tuesday and told him he agreed with his suggestion that the company give credits to customers who've been hit by pre-emptive power shut-offs. Newsom had suggested $100 per household, or $250 per business.\n\nJohnson said the utility has agreed to provide a 'one-time bill credit' for people impacted by an Oct. 9 power cutoff that affected some 2 million people. But he didn't confirm a figure, saying the mechanics had yet to be worked out.\n\n'We have agreed to move forward with a one-time bill credit for customers impacted by that event.'", "description": "Santa Ana winds - also known as Devil Winds - were due to hit southern California on Wednesday, fanning the flames of wildfires burning around Los Angeles and sparking fresh blazes.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20372044-0-image-a-75_1572435422089.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
