The Regressor says \u201cthe quality is supposed to be \u2018bad\u2019: if it looks like a flaw or error, it was likely 100 per cent intentional and either left in or put in on purpose.\u201d The aim wasn\u2019t to create a perfect copy of Ocarina of Time or Majora\u2019s Mask visuals, but to make something similar while taking a few \u201cartistic liberties.\u201d\n\nThe result is impressive. The visuals and animation, while polished up just a little, otherwise look faithful to the N64 era while simultaneously managing to capture the original trailer's most important moments. A shout-out too for the audio work of YouTuber Vince94, which does an equally brilliant job capturing the retro vibe.\n\nThere\u2019s still no word on a release date or even release window for Breath of the Wild's sequel. Maybe I'll dig my N64 out to wile away the time...\n\nThis post originally appeared on Kotaku UK, bringing you original reporting, game culture and humour from the British isles.", "description": "Nintendo\u2019s announcement that a sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was in development was one of the high points of E3 2019.
