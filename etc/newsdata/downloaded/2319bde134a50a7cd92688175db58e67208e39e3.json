More than three thousand people died on September 11, 2001 after terrorists hijacked planes and flew them into the towers, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. But there were thousands of regular folks who fled their apartments, homes and offices not knowing if they would live out the day. One of them was Christina Ray Stanton. She and her husband were living the dream as New Yorkers climbing the corporate ladder of success. They lived in lower Manhattan a few blocks from the World Trade Center.
