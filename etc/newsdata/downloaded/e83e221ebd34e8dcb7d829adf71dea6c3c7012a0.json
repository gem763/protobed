The hobbyist\u2019s computer display was filling up with messages about real-time medical emergencies from across the region. For some reason, the hobbyist had set up an internet-connected webcam pointed at the display. But because there was no password on the webcam, anyone who knew where to look could also see what was on the rig\u2019s computer display.\n\nDaley Borda, a security researcher and bug bounty hunter, was at home in Florida when he stumbled upon the exposed webcam. The live stream was grainy, and the quality of the images so poor that it was just possible to make out the text on the display.\n\n\u201cYou can see details of calls coming in \u2014 their name, address, and injury,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nTechCrunch verified his findings. Messages spilling across the screen appeared to direct nearby ambulances where to go following calls to the 999 emergency services.\n\nOne message said a 98-year-old man had fallen at his home address. A few moments later, another message said 49-year-old male was complaining of chest pains at a nearby residence. One after the other, messages were flooding in, describing accidents, incidents, medical emergencies, often including their home addresses.\n\nBorda spends much of his time scouring the internet for things that shouldn\u2019t be online. He looks for exposed databases and devices and, like most other security researchers, privately reports them to their owners. If he\u2019s lucky, the owner takes action. Better yet, they pay out a bug bounty for his efforts.\n\nBut he could not figure out who the rig belonged to. TechCrunch contacted the hobbyist\u2019s internet provider to warn of the data exposure.\n\n\u201cLast night we contacted the customer to make them aware that there was a live webcam broadcasting on the open web from their household,\u201d said a spokesperson from the internet provider. \u201cThe customer was unaware of the nature of the information being shown so has said that they will stop the feed on that particular camera.\u201d\n\nThe hobbyist was picking up and decoding pager communications from a nearby regional National Health Service trust.\n\n\u201cWith some cheap, relatively basic, software it is possible for hobbyists to access these frequencies and decode the information being sent, which appears is what has occurred here,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nOld but reliable\n\nPagers \u2014 or beepers \u2014 may be a relic of the past, but remain a fixture in U.K. hospitals.\n\nThese traditionally one-way communication devices allow anyone to send messages to one or many pagers at once by calling a dedicated phone number, often manned by an operator, which are then broadcast as radio waves over the pager network. But pagers still offer benefits where newer technologies, like cell phones, fall down. Because they work a low frequency, pager radio waves are able to travel further and deeper inside large buildings \u2014 particularly hospitals \u2014 which have thickened walls to protect others from X-rays and other radiation. Pagers also work across long distances, including in cell service dead-spots.\n\nBut few were thinking about message security when pager use was at its peak.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t secure,\u201d Andy Keck, an electronics and amateur radio hobbyist, told TechCrunch. Keck said messages sent over the pager network are encoded when they are converted into a burst of radio waves and broadcast over the air.\n\n\u201cBut people don\u2019t necessarily understand the difference between encryption and encoding,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause the two widely used pager protocols \u2014 POCSAG and FLEX \u2014 are not encrypted, it\u2019s easy to understand what messages are broadcast over the airwaves using free and open-source software.\n\nFor years one of the largest barriers to intercepting and decoding pager messages \u2014 or any other radio waves \u2014 was that hobbyists needed custom, often expensive hardware. But with the advent of software-defined radios, most hobbyists can get by with a $20 plug-in dongle and an antenna.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just enter the command to start the application, sit back, and start decoding in real time on the screen,\u201d he said.\n\n130,000 NHS pagers\n\nAlthough the number of pagers has dropped to near-zero from their height in the 1980s, pagers still carry a considerable amount of information every day.\n\nPager messages can travel over a large distance, said Keck, depending on how high the transmitter is located. Most major cities are covered with some pager service. Given the geography of the U.K., amateur radio hobbyists can often pick up pager messages from different sources.\n\nThe NHS still uses about 130,000 pagers, according to the U.K. government\u2019s latest count, or about 10 percent of the world\u2019s current pagers in use. But the NHS has been told to stop using pagers altogether by 2021.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear how many trusts are exposing medical information \u2014 if at all. According to NHS spokesperson Oliver Michelson, \u201ceach NHS organization is responsible for its own IT equipment and security.\u201d\n\nOne NHS trust we spoke to said they had around 1,600 pagers and are managed by the trust. (We are not naming the trust, as it would expose their communications.) When asked if the trust was aware that pager messages are not encrypted and can be intercepted by amateur radio hobbyists, the spokesperson responded: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAnother trust we spoke to said they were \u201caware\u201d that the handful of pagers it operates do not encrypt their messages. The trust said their pagers were managed by a third-party.\n\nPageOne, the last remaining pager network in the U.K., says in a brochure that its pager service can deliver \u201creal-time messaging cost effectively and securely to their staff.\u201d\n\nBut a spokesperson told TechCrunch: \u201cPageOne ensures customers are aware of the ability to intercept messages in its terms and conditions\u201d and that encrypted services \u201care available if required.\u201d\n\nThe company said the majority of NHS pagers are operated on private pager networks operated by the trusts themselves.\n\n\u2018Trivially interceptable\u2019\n\nAmateur radio hobbyists know all too well the risks posed by unencrypted pagers.\n\nOver the years there have been numerous headlines of hobbyists picking up signals from nearby hospitals, including patients\u2019 names and medical information. Some have even turned eavesdropping on hospital pagers into an art project.\n\nLast month, hospitals in Vancouver were found broadcasting unencrypted patient medical data across the city.\n\nSarah Jamie Lewis, executive director at Open Privacy, who first revealed the issue, said the hospital pager messages were \u201ctrivially interceptable\u201d by anyone nearby.\n\n\u201cIt tends to be pretty common knowledge in the amateur radio community that these kind of broadcasts are going on but it\u2019s only recently that we started seeing a culture of disclosure,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nIn the U.K., it\u2019s legal for amateur radio hobbyists to scan the airwaves but unlawful to disclose the contents of messages. That\u2019s put some security-focused hobbyists who disclose exposed sensitive messages in a tough legal spot.\n\n\u201cYou get this horrible situation where not disclosing is bad, but people have a right to know that their health data is being breached,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nBut the penalties could be far steeper for organizations that expose sensitive health data. Exposing personally identifiable and health information violates GDPR, the Europe-wide data protection laws that came into force last year. Organizations can be fined heavily for breaching the rules.\n\nWith more than a year on the clock before the NHS pager ban comes into effect, it\u2019s not a problem that can be easily fixed.\n\nThe obvious solution would be not to send sensitive health or medical data over pager messages. Clearly, as seen by the amateur hobbyist\u2019s radio rig, that message isn\u2019t getting through.\n\nGot a tip? You can send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849.
