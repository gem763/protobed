A tube of tomato paste here mimics the deep flavors of sun-dried tomato. Frying a few generous squeezes caramelizes the tomato's sugars and saturates the olive oil, making a mixture that's ready to glom onto anything you stir through it. Here, it\u2019s white beans, though you could add in kale, noodles, even roasted vegetables. Then, all that\u2019s left to do is dot it with cheese and bake until it\u2019s as molten or singed as you like. Serve with bread and a bitter-green salad.", "description": "For those of you who love lasagna's edges, where sticky tomato meets crisp cheese, this whole dish is for you \u2014 even the middle A tube of tomato paste here mimics the deep flavors of sun-dried tomato Frying a few generous squeezes caramelizes the tomato's sugars and saturates the olive oil, making a mixture that's ready to glom onto anything you stir through it", "authors": ["Ali Slagle", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Colu Henry", "Lidey Heuck", "Molly O'Neill", "Moira Hodgson", "Alex Witchel", "Mark Bittman", "Barbara Kafka", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/dining/as-white-bean-tomato/as-white-bean-tomato-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-23"}
