Among the ventures banned are the Chinese startups SenseTime, Megvii, and Yitu, which, combined, have raised billions of dollars to develop commercial facial recognition technology.\n\nThose three companies, which have flourished amid the Chinese government\u2019s push for investments into artificial intelligence, have faced mounting criticism over perceived misuse of their technology by government agencies, particularly in Xinjiang, where it is believed to have played a role in the arrest and detention of more than a million Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities. While SenseTime and Megvii have denied working with state entities in the region, researchers and academics have uncovered troubling connections between their facial recognition tech and the surveillance and imprisonment of minorities in China.\n\nIn identifying these 28 organizations and companies, which also included security camera manufacturers Hikvision and Dahua Technology, the Commerce Department noted that they \u201cpose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecifically, these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in [Xinjiang],\u201d the directive read.\n\nThe Chinese government has come under scrutiny for its treatment of Uighurs and other ethnic minority groups. US leaders, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have accused it of human rights violations within its camps, ranging from involuntary imprisonment to torture. The Chinese government has dismissed these criticisms, insisting the camps are centers for reeducation or vocational training.\n\nEarlier this year, the US blacklisted Huawei over national security concerns, dealing a major blow to the Chinese telecom and mobile device giant\u2019s international business prospects. In June, the Trump administration added five more Chinese companies to the list and was said to be weighing further additions amid an increasingly hostile trade war.\n\nIn May, BuzzFeed News revealed the process by which money from US public pension funds, university endowments, and foundations helped fund SenseTime and Megvii. It\u2019s unclear how those investments will be affected by the blacklist designation, which will also affect these companies' relationships with US-based sensor and chip suppliers, including Qualcomm and Nvidia.\n\n\"Megvii strongly objects to the company\u2019s designation on the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List, for which there are no grounds,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are committed to making sure our technology has a positive impact on society and we are in compliance with all laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate.\"\n\nThe company also acknowledged that around 1% of its total revenue was derived from projects in Xinjiang in 2018, though \"no revenue was generated\" from the region in the first six months of 2019. The company booked sales of about $200 million in 2018, according to financial documents.\n\nA spokesperson for SenseTime did not return an email request to comment from BuzzFeed News. The company told Reuters that it was deeply disappointed by the decision.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, a private company database, SenseTime is valued at more than $7.5 billion and Megvii at $4 billion, based on their latest rounds of private funding. Both companies are also moving toward initial public offerings.\n\n\n\nIn an August IPO prospectus, Megvii laid out the risks of the uncertain regulatory environment surrounding US\u2013China relations.\n\n\u201cChanges to trade policies, treaties and tariffs in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or the perception that these changes could occur, could adversely affect the financial and economic conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as our overseas expansion, our financial condition and results of operations,\u201d the company wrote in August.", "description": "\u201cThese entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses ... against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.\"", "authors": ["Ryan Mac", "Buzzfeed News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-10/7/22/asset/92528b67e8f0/sub-buzz-1486-1570485958-1.jpg?crop=2306:1207;0,165", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
