She has reduced her consumption since this incident and she has flown since this incident without any issues.\u2019\n\n\u2018This incident was clearly extremely unpleasant. I don\u2019t seek to minimise the circumstances of this offence.\n\n\u2018But she was able to be returned to her seat without being restrained and without causing any physical injuries.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudge Hilary Manley said Allen had reached the \u2018end of the line\u2019 and decided to make an example of her.\n\nShe said Allen \u2018knew full well\u2019 that she was not allowed to drink her duty free alcohol until she arrived at her destination.\n\nThe judge added: \u2018You were drunk. You were also likely under the influence of cannabis.\n\n\u2018You singled out on senior member of cabin crew for particularly aggressive treatment.\n\n\u2018She genuinely believed you were going to hit and seriously injure her.\u2019\n\nThe judge said the captain could hear and see her behaviour from the cockpit, which would no doubt have been \u2018distracting an unnerving\u2019.\n\nShe added: \u2018Your drunken, loutish, self-indulgent behaviour caused unease and disruption to passengers and cost and disruption to the airline.\n\n\u2018For passengers to be trapped on a metal tube at 40,000 feet with a drunken thug is terrifying.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
