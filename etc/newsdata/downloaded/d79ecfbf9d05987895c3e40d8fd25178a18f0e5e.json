Should we have seen that three or four years ago - maybe. But now we need to get on with the job,\" he told the BBC in June.\n\nThe business has not been alone in finding the going tough on the High Street.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, Britain's biggest department store chain Debenhams fell into the hands of its lenders as part of an administration process, while House of Fraser was sold to Mike Ashley's Sports Direct last year.\n\nMarks and Spencer has also illustrated the woes facing traditional retailers, falling out of the FTSE 100 index this week amid competition from firms such as Primark on the High Street and Boohoo online.\n\n'Challenging year'\n\nThe results are for Taveta Investments, the holding company of the Arcadia group of businesses owned by Sir Philip's wife Tina.\n\nThe company said the 4.5% fall in its turnover was caused by \"the ongoing challenging global market conditions for retailers\".\n\nIf exceptional items and other one-off costs are stripped out the company made an operating profit of \u00a378.1m, down from \u00a3124.1m a year earlier.\n\nTaveta said profits were knocked because it was not able to close stores at the same pace that sales fell.\n\n\"After coming through a challenging year, we are now very clear on our strategic direction,\" it added.\n\nIn a trading update in the latest results, the directors say that after closing its US stores and the Outfit Kids business, the group is expected to remain in its current form with a \"portfolio of diverse, market-leading brands\".\n\nImage copyright Lester Cohen Image caption Tina Green, owner of Arcadia with her husband, Arcadia chairman Sir Philip Green\n\nThe results highlight the importance of refinancing a \u00a3310m loan on the flagship Topshop store on London's Oxford Street, which is currently due to be repaid in December.\n\nIf that does not happen, the company said \"the lenders would be able to enforce their security on its property in order to recover their debt\".\n\nThe directors express confidence that the loan can be refinanced. They says the store remains an attractive site, with Nike taking an additional floor in the building, while space previously used by Miss Selfridge has been leased to retailer Vans.\n\nHowever, they also say that the risk around the refinancing of the Oxford Street store and the \"on-going difficult financial conditions in a volatile retail sector\" could force the business to seek fresh financing.\n\nOn a pre-tax basis, Taveta's loss is \u00a3177m compared with profits of \u00a353.5m a year earlier.\n\nResults for Arcadia, filed separately, show a pre-tax loss of \u00a393m compared with \u00a3164m in the previous year.", "description": "The business blames a dramatically changed retail landscape and competition from rivals for the loss.", "authors": ["Jill Treanor", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2317/production/_108638980_topshop_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
