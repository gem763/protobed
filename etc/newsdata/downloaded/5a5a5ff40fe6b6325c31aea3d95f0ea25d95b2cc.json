He told talk radio station 702 on Wednesday morning that if the system improves, Eskom will relieve load shedding where it can.\n\n\"[At] this point in time, realistically, we believe the situation will continue for the next week,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, Eskom issued a statement indicating it would implement stage 2 load shedding between 09:00 and 23:00 on Wednesday.\n\nYelland says Eskom\u2019s communication thus far appears to indicate that six power-generating units are now down as a result of boiler tube leaks.\n\nA fraction of capacity\n\nApart from those outages, the conveyor feeding coal between Exxaro\u2019s Grootegeluk mine to the Medupi power station in Lephalale, Limpopo, broke down on Saturday. It\u2019s still not working and Medupi is running at a third of its capacity.\n\nThe mine is 8.4km away from the power station.\n\nExxaro executive head of stakeholder affairs Mzila Mthenjane has directed questions posed by Fin24 to Eskom, as the failure was not on Exxaro's belt. Eskom is yet to respond to Fin24's queries.\n\nThere are also technical problems at the Grootvlei power station near Balfour in Mpumalanga, according to Yelland.\n\nOne Koeberg unit is down for refuelling, which took 900MW of power out of the equation. But the situation at Koeberg is different from the rest, as it\u2019s part of a planned shutdown, says Yelland. It usually takes two to three months to refuel a reactor.\n\nIn all, the unplanned breakdowns now amount to 10 500MW.\n\nSince Saturday, Eskom has been relying on open cycle gas turbines \"extensively\" to make up for the electricity shortfall. But now the diesel stocks that fuel these turbines are running low. It also used pumped storage hydro electrical plants, but dam levels supplying these plants in the Drakensberg are also not high enough.\n\nThese two options are only supposed to be used in emergencies, and not intended for extensive usage, says Yelland.\n\nThe Department of Public Enterprises has said it will not be issuing a statement on the matter at this stage.\n\n\n\nCompiled by Lameez Omarjee and Helena Wasserman", "description": "A number of problems have hit Eskom's plants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8639/9489f28a04924bb0a3a036334e5ee6f0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
