Kamala Harris' re-engagement in Iowa is part of a broader acknowledgment inside the campaign that she hasn\u2019t been in the early states enough. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images 2020 Elections Kamala Harris bets it all on Iowa to break freefall The plan, described by sources familiar with it to POLITICO, is to ease up on big fundraisers and spend a lot more time in the first voting state.\n\nKamala Harris is putting her stumbling campaign on the line with a new Iowa-or-bust strategy: She's shifting away from the closed-door fundraisers that dominated her summer calendar to focus on retail politicking in the crucial kickoff state.\n\nHarris huddled with top campaign officials Tuesday in Baltimore to discuss the next steps as a series of polls show her plummeting into the mid-single digits. She's not expected to significantly alter her message. Instead, Harris is planning to make weekly visits to the state and nearly double the size of her 65-person ground operation, sources familiar with the discussions told POLITICO.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe re-engagement in Iowa \u2014 where the California senator held a 17-stop bus tour in August but hasn\u2019t returned since \u2014 is part of a broader acknowledgment inside the campaign that she hasn\u2019t been in the early states enough. It's designed to refocus her campaign and clarify her narrowing path to the nomination.\n\nHarris has been backsliding since her summer confrontation with Joe Biden, dropping so far in recent surveys that her once-promising campaign appears in danger of becoming an afterthought.\n\nAn Iowa poll out Wednesday, conducted by her own pollster for another client, showed Harris well out of range of the frontrunners, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, and behind Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nA half-dozen Harris officials and outside allies briefed on internal expectations said she needs a top-tier finish in Iowa to remain competitive and put her in position to strike in Nevada, South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, when her home state of California holds its primary.\n\nHarris herself appeared to confirm the Iowa focus on Wednesday, though not on purpose.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fucking moving to Iowa,\u201d she joked to a colleague in Washington, within earshot of a reporter.\n\nHarris' message has toggled between a frontal assault on Donald Trump and kitchen-table economic plans that aides still believe can resonate with primary voters. Ian Sams, a Harris campaign spokesman, stressed that there\u2019s time for a comeback.\n\n\u201cIf off-year summer polls determined the primary's outcome, we\u2019d all be talking about how Presidents Wes Clark and Hillary Clinton were faring in retirement,\u201d Sams said. \u201cWe're not playing to win a news cycle. We're playing to win an election. We want to peak when votes are cast in the early states and in March, and our infrastructure is built to do just that.\u201d\n\nCampaign officials and top surrogates said that she\u2019s unlikely to claw out of the rut with a single breakout moment. They described her upcoming efforts as an attempt at a slow reemergence they hope materializes by stringing together consistent performances.\n\nIn recent days, they\u2019ve tried to recapture the energy behind Harris\u2019 Senate committee interrogation of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by calling for his impeachment. She talked about the push with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, following up with a memorable moment on guns on NBC\u2019s \u201cTonight Show.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, aides say a Harris turnaround depends almost entirely on Biden\u2019s campaign crashing and burning.\n\nHarris, who held recent fundraisers in New York, Connecticut and Baltimore, has prioritized fundraising during the third quarter of the year. She didn\u2019t start her campaign with the advantages of her higher-polling rivals, including Biden and Sanders, who came in with massive donor networks, or Warren, who transferred more than $10 million from her 2018 Senate campaign. Warren has since sworn off big-dollar events for the primary, giving her time to stretch the primary map and spend hours and hours with supporters in selfie lines.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Online giving typically slows when a campaign hits a rough patch. That's made Harris even more reliant on the in-person events that require travel and considerable time away from the trail.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is you need money to run the campaign, but you have to balance that with campaigning,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist. \u201cShe didn\u2019t start at the same place financially \u2026 She didn\u2019t have the same pieces others had coming out of the starting block.\u201d\n\nWhile Harris will continue to hold fundraisers, the priority will be on campaigning. There are some potential bright spots for Harris to build off. Interest in her remains high at her early-state stops. During her last trip to Iowa, for the bus tour, she locked down endorsements from the political power couple Sue and Bob Dvorsky, along with the Iowa Asian and Latino Coalition.\n\nBut the coalition\u2019s support also serves as a warning of sorts, according to the group\u2019s chairman. In an interview, Prakash Kopparapu said Harris needs to be in the state more.\n\nHarris has \"the most practical, pragmatic plans,\u201d Kopparapu said. \u201cBut they have to listen to that message often. And it has to be part of their day-to-day conversations \u2014 not just when they watch TV, or go to an event.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The plan, described by sources familiar with it to POLITICO, is to ease up on big fundraisers and spend a lot more time in the first voting state.", "authors": ["Christopher Cadelago"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/66/da/6ce4b4474f4294aefa43588ef523/190918-kamala-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
