While Masvidal viewed the situation with an outsider\u2019s lens, Diaz was in the middle of the internal conversations.\n\nFour days before he issued his Twitter statement, Diaz was informed of USADA\u2019s finding. He also indicated the UFC and/or USADA asked him to stay silent until further testing was done.\n\nClearly, Diaz didn\u2019t take that advice. On a UFC 244 conference call Monday, he explained why.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t happy about any of it actually. I think that it was all a big old bunch of (expletive),\u201d Diaz said. \u201cI just wanted to not be a part of the big old (expletive) secret. I think the thing about people on steroids is people on steroids don\u2019t talk about steroids out loud.\u201d\n\nDiaz never was going to hold off from getting ahead of the issue. Even though he could have risked millions by saying he\u2019d walk away from perhaps the most anticipated bout of the year, Diaz believes his legacy is most important.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it ruins your show,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cYou ain\u2019t ruining my whole legacy. All I believe in the whole game is that I\u2019m all natural. If we were cavemen, I\u2019d be the hardest caveman out there.\u201d\n\nOn Friday night, the UFC held an impromptu news conference at their Las Vegas headquarters and informed MMA Junkie, among others, of its findings. Diaz had tested positive for LGD-4033, or Ligandrol \u2013 the result of a tainted supplement. Once the positive test was proved unintentional, Diaz (20-11 MMA, 15-9 UFC) was cleared, and the fight with Masvidal (34-13 MMA, 11-6 UFC) was officially ruled to continue on.\n\nThroughout Monday\u2019s call, Diaz implied he believed his flagged test was a concerted effort by the powers that be to undermine his popularity and leverage going forward.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t even get into details, but every time after a fight relationships change with the whole company,\u201d Diaz said. \u201c\u2026 They can\u2019t have a real (expletive) like me owning the whole (shit), being the hardest, because too many people are going to hear it.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t trying to bust anyone out, but I feel like they need some type of leverage over me to keep me from being the king of the whole (expletive). They have been the whole time. \u2026 I don\u2019t feel like anybody\u2019s ever been on my side in this (expletive).\u201d\n\nDiaz indicated he doesn\u2019t expect his relationships to improve now that the fight is carrying out as planned. The former UFC title challenger said he finds humor in the whole situation.\n\n\u201cI think that whole \u2018keeping it a secret\u2019 talk is fight (expletive) just for everybody to make money, and it\u2019s (expletive) cheating. So I\u2019m not going to be a part of that,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cI was just out of the game for three years for the reason being we ain\u2019t on the same page or the same team. So why am I going to be on the same page or same team about making the cheat try to go down?\n\n\u201c\u2026 I think it\u2019s funny that they all got busted for tripping,\u201d Diaz added. \u201cI don\u2019t give a (expletive). It\u2019s all good. It is what it is. You know what I\u2019m saying? I\u2019d expect nothing less.\u201d\n\nWhile Diaz\u2019s situation was getting figured out, Masvidal was left in limbo. During a 48-hour period, \u201cGambred\u201d didn\u2019t have a clear idea of what the situation meant for his upcoming fight. When he first saw the tweet, Masvidal didn\u2019t think it was real.\n\n\u201cThat was (expletive) nuts, you know?\u201d Masvidal said. \u201cI was like, \u2018What the (expletive)? Nah, that\u2019s Photoshopped.\u2019 I digged a little harder, and it wasn\u2019t Photoshopped.\n\n\u201cA little bit of anxiety came. Not anixety in the sense I thought Nate was a cheater, because I never thought he was a cheater. Just the uncertainty like, \u2018They might pull my fight because of some lab screw-up? Because of some weirdass (expletive)?\u2019 I don\u2019t want to diss on USADA, either, because I think they\u2019ve cleaned up a lot of the sport, but it\u2019s not 100 percent right yet.\u201d\n\nFrom there, anxiety set in and so did the binge-eating. Masvidal credits his coaches and his father for taking his mind off of food and back to the task at hand.\n\n\u201cBy Day No. 2, anxiety hit,\u201d Masvidal said. \u201cAbout two pizzas later and hot fries and other things I shouldn\u2019t have put in my body, the coaching staff got a hold of me to calm the anxiety down. We went about business. When I get anxiety and depression and things like that, I take to eating.\u201d\n\nNot to worry, though. With the fight still on, Masvidal insists there\u2019s no reason to worry about him making weight.\n\nDiaz and Masvidal will square off in the main event of UFC 244 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The five-round headliner will mark the first ever \u201cBMF\u201d title fight in UFC history.", "description": "Jorge Masvidal tried to keep calm and ate a lot.
