It said it would be burning the carcasses to prevent the anthrax infection from spreading to other animals.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, anthrax is a bacteria found naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals when they breathe in or ingest spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. Anthrax is not contagious and humans can only get infected by ingesting the bacteria. It can be prevented in animals via regular vaccination.\n\nBotswana is home to almost a third of Africa's elephants, around 130,000. Botswana has lifted a ban on big-game hunting to combat a growing conflict between humans and wildlife.\n\nBotswana and its neighbours in southern Africa are experiencing a severe drought because of below-average rainfall since an El Ni\u00f1o weather system struck in 2015.", "description": "More than 100 elephants have died in Botswana in the past two months partly because of a suspected anthrax outbreak.", "authors": ["Radio Canada International"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5331034.1571773127!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-royals-botswana.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
