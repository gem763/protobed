REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\nThe majority of the waste was dumped in the delta regions of the Yangtze and Pearl rivers, both major industrial zones on China\u2019s eastern coast, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, there are some clear problems with the work on the marine ecological environment, with some regions not showing a lot of awareness or paying sufficient attention, and lacking strong initiative and dedication,\u201d Huo Chuanlin, deputy director of the MEE\u2019s marine environment department, said at a briefing in Beijing.\n\nEnvironmental groups have expressed concern that China, desperate to clean up its own rivers, is dumping increasing amounts of trash in its seas instead.\n\nHowever, Huo said overall conditions in China\u2019s coastal waters, including issues like wastewater entering the seas from rivers, were improving and China could not be blamed for a global ocean polluting crisis.\n\n\u201cChina is the biggest producer and exporter of plastic products, accounting for about 30% of the world\u2019s total, but that doesn\u2019t mean China is a major marine plastic polluting country,\u201d he said.\n\nChina found an average of 24 kilograms of floating trash per 1,000 square meters of surface water last year, 88.7% of which was plastic, the ministry said. Plastic also dominated the waste found below the surface, including on the seabed.\n\nEarlier this year, Beijing published an action plan designed to clean up the Bohai Bay, one of the country\u2019s busiest and most polluted waterways.\n\nChina has earmarked 7 billion yuan ($991.70 million) for the clean-up this year alone, but Huo said it is still expected to struggle to meet a key target aimed at making at least 73% of Bohai waters fit for human contact by next year, up from around 70% at present.\n\nChina is planning to make around 30% of its coastal waters completely off-limits to development as part of a national \u201cecological red line\u201d scheme.\n\nBut it is also trying to protect its rivers and improve the environment of its cities by moving polluting industries like steel and petrochemicals to the coast.", "description": "China dumped a total of 200.7 million cubic meters of waste into its coastal waters in 2018, a 27% rise on the previous year and the highest level in at least a decade, the country's environment ministry said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Muyu Xu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446079275&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S09R", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
