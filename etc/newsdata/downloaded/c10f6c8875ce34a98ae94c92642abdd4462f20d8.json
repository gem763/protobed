I was only 21 at the time and so we weren't planning to have kids yet.'\n\nMs Burgess said that her choice to not have joint bank accounts with her husband also fuelled the government's skepticism.\n\nBut the couple refused to be torn apart, so they flew to Malaysia where Mr Wangkimshen was granted a temporary visa to return to Australia.\n\nMr Wangkimshen hasn't seen their two sons in more than 18 months, and still hasn't met his newborn daughter after he was deported in 2014\n\nThe couple and their twin sons briefly moved to Pakistan where Mr Wangkimshen had extended family\n\nIt was after they arrived home that Ms Burgess fell pregnant with twins.\n\nThe government allowed Mr Wangkimshen to stay in Australia for the birth due to the high risk nature of Ms Burgess' pregnancy.\n\n'They would say we'll give you two more weeks, one more month. That's how it went for the whole pregnancy,' she said.\n\nMs Burgess gave birth to twins Imran and Ibrahim six weeks prematurely in March 2017, with her husband by her side.\n\n'Muslim men don't go into the labour ward and he was allowed to go in and change their nappies the first time. He was so proud,' she said.\n\n'I had never seen Mohd cry until his sons were born.'\n\nBut due to the chaos in the wake of the twins' birth, Mr Wangkimshen ended up overstaying his visa by a month.\n\nHe reported himself to immigration and was put in a detention centre in Melbourne for seven weeks in August, before being deported back to Malaysia for a second time.\n\nMs Burgess said it's been heartbreaking spending the last nine months in Australia by herself while raising her two sons, who are now two-and-a-half, and her four-month-old daughter Hawa\n\nBecause he overstayed Mr Wangkimshen was banned from applying for a visa for two years.\n\nMs Burgess was left to juggle two infant sons by herself, all while travelling back and forth to visit her husband in the detention centre.\n\n'I was left with the twins on my own from when they were about three months old, I don't know how I survived that time, it was all just a blur,' Ms Burgess said.\n\nWhile trying to fathom a life of raising two kids on her own, Ms Burgess started planning a move to Malaysia so her family could be together.\n\nBut after finding out this would require giving up her Australian citizenship, the young mother gave up on the idea.\n\n'There was no way I was giving up all my Australian rights, it's better for us and for the kids to grow up in Australia,' she said.\n\n'I was only willing to take them over to Malaysia for anywhere up to two to five years.\n\nAs a means to an end, the family relocated to Pakistan for nine months, where Mr Wangkimshen's extended family lived.\n\nWhile living in the Middle Eastern nation, Ms Burgess fell pregnant with a daughter at the end of last year.\n\nBut while six months pregnant, the expectant mother was forced to make the 'traumatic' decision to move back to Australia by herself to give birth.\n\n'I had to leave Pakistan just because the risk of mothers and children dying is a lot higher. I had heard so many horror stories,' she said.\n\nMs Burgess has started a Change.org petition in the hopes of gaining support and boost morale in the plight to bring her husband back to Australia\n\n'I had to pretty much start from scratch again. I had to get a rental property, a car, and put the kids in day care once a week. I had to do it all over.'\n\nMs Burgess said it's been heartbreaking spending the last nine months in Australia by herself while raising her two sons, who are now two-and-a-half, and her four-month-old daughter Hawa.\n\n'Imagine giving birth to a child and the father sees her for the first time through a video call,' she said through tears.\n\n'The boys always say \"Dada, come home\".'\n\nMs Burgess has started a Change.org petition in the hopes of gaining support and boost morale in the plight to bring her husband back to Australia.\n\n'I'm sick of getting rejected, I just want him back here,' she said.\n\n'I've had a lot of people saying to move but I've tried everything. I tried to live in Malaysia and I couldn't. I went to Pakistan and the kids can't live there forever.\n\n'And my mum tears up straight away at the thought of not getting to see her grandchildren grow up.'\n\nMr Wangkimshen's two-year visa ban recently ended, and the father now plans to either reapply for a partner visa or parent visa.\n\nBut the couple will need to fork out $6,500 application fee.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs said it could not comment on individual cases.", "description": "Brittany Burgess, 26, from Corowa in country NSW, was swept off her feet after meetin Mohd\u00a0 Wangkimshen through mutual friends while he was on a tourist visa in 2012.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/03/19520856-0-image-a-31_1570675881524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
