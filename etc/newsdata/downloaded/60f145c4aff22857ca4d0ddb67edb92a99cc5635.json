For me, it was one of the most freeing experiences of my entire life.\n\nStaring down the internet and finding words to describe the social isolation that continually knocks me off balance was utter catharsis.\n\nIt let me finally give voice to the slow stripping away of privilege that happened when my body changed, growing out of standard sizing and into the 4X body \u2014 size 22/24 \u2014 that I now call home.\n\nIf you're plus-size, the isolation I am referring to is one you're already far too familiar with. The day when you can\u2019t just go to the mall with your friends, or the weight you reach when shopping in real life ceases being a fun activity and becomes outright punishing.\n\nMarielle Terhart loves fashion, but when it comes to selection in her size, her choices are limited.

And yes, to the privilege of wearing clothing that they love.\n\nSharing her feelings of loneliness in fashion, Terhart found she wasn't alone. Post image on Pinterest: Sharing her feelings of loneliness in fashion, Terhart found she wasn't alone.\n\nSharing her feelings of loneliness in fashion, Terhart found she wasn't alone.\n\nFashion is just one place in our world that places so much emphasis on thinness, but it's a place that stings the most for me \u2014 a fashion writer, photographer and influencer.\n\nThese roles have granted me the opportunity to speak at fashion conferences, to work with my favourite brands, to grow and build a fashion community online.\n\nI thought it was enough until I hosted 13 plus-size women in my home for a photo shoot, and I realized just how alone I felt.\n\nThe utter euphoria of trying something on and actually having a person there to say, 'Yes, you look amazing!' The realization that I could actually share my clothing with others. The utter validation in simply being seen.\n\nTo realize all this work I put into growing a voice for plus-size bodies in the ethical fashion community was rooted deeply in wanting to fill that unspoken void, and most importantly I wasn't alone in that loneliness.\n\nSo on July 18, I wept to 6,000 viewers and I used my corner of the internet to say the things I\u2019ve spent a lot of my life glossing over.\n\nWatch Terhart's Instagram story:\n\nWithin minutes of posting these 20 Instagram stories, I realized I wasn't alone. These feelings I\u2019ve quietly carried for years were being echoed back, same yet different.\n\nMore than 400 people replied, mostly thicker bodies, all expressing the same social isolation, the shame in attending clothing swaps, the avoidance of shopping, and the fact that being fat continues to exclude you from the simplest activities.\n\nIt spanned beyond opting out of mall hangouts, reaching into travel (one follower shared lying about being afraid of donkeys to avoid telling her friend she was indeed over 200 pounds, thus exceeding the posted weight limit), slumber parties, family events and numerous other activities that highlighted a universal bias \u2014 that being fat makes you no longer acceptable or worthy.\n\nThese are some of the more than 400 comments Terhart received after she shared her story on Instagram.

We need to all be working together to end the marginalization of bodies because all bodies are good bodies, and all bodies deserve dignity.\n\nIt feels freeing to write this now, to keep saying these things, and to know I am not in the minority.\n\nIt also has made me blunter, so when I am asked in a store if I found what I was looking for, when I reply honestly, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t carry my size, I hope that changes\u201d \u2014 I am no longer speaking only for myself.\n\nThat bravery is for all of us.", "description": "Marielle Terhart has built her life and career around fashion.
