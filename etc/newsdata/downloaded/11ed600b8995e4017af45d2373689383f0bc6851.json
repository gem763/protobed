Steve Sisolak declared in a statement that there has been \"lack of oversight and inaction\" of the recreational and medical pot industry by the state Marijuana Enforcement Division. He also said he is commissioning a multi-agency task force to \"root out potential corruption or criminal influences in Nevada's marijuana marketplace.\"\n\nThe Democratic governor pointed to a federal indictment made public Thursday in New York alleging that a man identified as having \"Russian roots\" funneled $10,000 each to the Republican campaigns of Adam Laxalt and Wesley Duncan.\n\nThe indictment included a conspiracy charge against four men, including two with ties to President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and the Ukraine investigation at the center of impeachment proceedings.\n\nLaxalt lost the race for Nevada governor. Duncan ran unsuccessfully for attorney general.\n\nBoth said Thursday through spokesmen that they would return the donations they received a week before the November 2018 election from a donor named Igor Fruman. Federal prosecutors allege that Fruman, a Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen, was acting on behalf of an unnamed foreign national.\n\nFILE - This July 24, 2019 file photo shows Nevada Gov.

Dozens of companies argued the state should redo a process that awarded 61 new dispensary licenses last December to 16 businesses among 462 applications.\n\n\"Effective immediately,\" Sisolak's statement said, \"any marijuana entity - licensed or unlicensed - that violates the law will see swift and severe criminal and regulatory action.\"\n\nMcInerney did not immediately respond to messages seeking details.\n\nThe statement called the governor \"disappointed in the lack of oversight and ... inaction from the state over many years that led us to this critical juncture.\"\n\nIt pointed to the \"apparent absence of a single criminal referral by the Marijuana Enforcement Division since the inception of licensed marijuana sales, medical or recreational, in Nevada.\"\n\nNevada voters legalized medical marijuana in 2000 and approved recreational use in a separate ballot measure in 2016.\n\nFILE - In this Nov. 6, 2018 file photo Republican Adam Laxalt concedes the Nevada governor's race to Democrat Steve Sisolak in Reno, Nev.
