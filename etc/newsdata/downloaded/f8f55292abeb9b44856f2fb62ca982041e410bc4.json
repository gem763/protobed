That\u2019s why opposition to the milquetoast establishmentarian Brett Kavanaugh was so fierce, even before the 11th-hour sexual-assault allegations.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh was supposed to have single-handedly overturned Roe v. Wade, but a funny thing happened on the road to apocalypse. Particularly in petition rejections and other procedural votes, Kavanaugh has demonstrated a pragmatic approach. And a term with few big controversies showed the liberals voting together much more than the conservatives.\n\nLegacy: Justice John Paul Stevens exemplified a dignified, reserved Supreme Court\n\nLiberal justices vote together at high rates\n\nThere were 67 decisions after argument in the term that ended in June. In those cases, the four justices appointed by Democratic presidents voted the same way 51 times, while the five Republican appointees held tight 37 times. And of the 20 cases where the court split 5-4, only seven had the \u201cexpected\u201d ideological divide of conservatives over liberals. By the end of the term, each conservative justice had joined the liberals as the deciding vote at least once.\n\nThat dynamic isn\u2019t something that sprang up in the Trump era or with the court\u2019s newest personnel. In the 2014-15 term, with Kennedy at the height of his \u201cswing vote\u201d power \u2014the last full term before Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death and resulting year-long vacancy \u2014 the four liberals stuck together in 55 of 66 cases, while the four conservatives (not counting Kennedy) voted as a unit in 39.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court (Photo: Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nEven in 2013-14, when liberals and conservatives voted with their respective coalitions equally (54 times in 67 cases), 42 of those decisions were unanimous and there were only ten 5-4 rulings. In other words, when conservative justices vote together at the same rate as their liberal counterparts, it\u2019s because the entire court is united.\n\nSpeaking of politically fraught cases that end up 5-4, it\u2019s notable that there's never a question of how the liberal justices will vote. Speculation runs rampant over whether one of the conservatives will go wobbly \u2014 whether out of unpredictable moderation, minimalistic pragmatism or idiosyncratic theory \u2014 but the liberals are guaranteed to please their constituency.\n\nConservatives side with liberal justices\n\nMost famously, of course, in 2012\u2019s National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Chief Justice John Roberts transmogrified the individual mandate into a tax to save Obamacare. Roberts did a similar thing twice this past term, in cases regarding the census citizenship question (Department of Commerce v. New York) and judicial deference to administrative-agency reinterpretations of their own regulations (Kisor v. Wilkie).\n\nGerrymandering decision: Ruling is a constitutional victory\n\nSuch intramural fractures often reveal lively intellectual debates that one rarely sees on the left. For example, Justice Neil Gorsuch has joined the liberals five times in 5-4 decisions, four of them this past term alone \u2014 with Gorsuch typically writing for the majority or concurring separately without adopting the liberal reasoning. These have mainly been criminal law cases, where Gorsuch\u2019s originalism shines through to the benefit of criminal defendants in the same way Scalia\u2019s often did \u2014 to the surprise of those who weren\u2019t paying attention.\n\nIndeed, Gorsuch is rapidly becoming a libertarian darling even as Kavanaugh steers down the middle of the road. Kavanaugh actually aligned himself as much with Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan as with Gorsuch. The Trump appointees voted the same less often in their first term together than any other two justices appointed by the same president, going back at least to President John F. Kennedy. Meanwhile, Obama appointees Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor were together in all the 5-4 cases this term.\n\nThe Ginsburg Four\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg speaks at Georgetown University on July 2, 2019. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nIn sum, if lockstep voting and a results-driven court concern us, it isn\u2019t the conservatives we should be worried about. While senators, journalists and academics love decrying the Roberts Five, it\u2019s the (Ruth Bader) Ginsburg Four that represent a bloc geared toward progressive policy outcomes. To be sure, a reinvigorated conservative grouping may yet come to dominate the court \u2014 especially if Trump fills another seat \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nIlya Shapiro is director of the Robert A.
