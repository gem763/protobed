Rolls Royce has nothing to do with cars. After selling its motoring division in the Eighties it no longer makes them, sells them, paints them, nothing. Who knew? Not I.\n\nI am prepared to admit then that I was a little disappointed when I arrived in Derby to visit the engineering company\u2019s Midlands base that the roads were not bumper to bonnet with regal behemoths.\n\nHowever, it was not the motors I was here to see, but rather plane engines. As part of its aerospace division, Rolls Royce builds nearly one in five aircraft engines in the world today, serving some tens of thousands of planes across more than 400 airlines.
