Earlier today, Booking Holdings, the owner of travel sites booking.com, priceline.com, agoda.com and Kayak, withdrew from the Libra Association.\n\nOther major payments- and commerce-related firms have left the association, including Mastercard, Visa, eBay, Stripe and PayPal. According to Reuters, the only remaining payments firm in the Libra Association is Netherlands-based PayU, which purportedly does not operate in the United States, Canada and many areas in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nCause for optimism?\n\nThe Libra Association is apparently remaining optimistic about going ahead with the project. Dante Disparte, the head of policy and communications at Libra Association, told Reuters that the recent flight of major backers is \u201ca correction; it\u2019s not a setback.\u201d However, Disparte further admitted that the coin could face delays as regulators continue to scrutinize the project.\n\nEarlier today, United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the firms left Libra because it was not \u201cup to par\u201d with American Anti-Money Laundering standards. Mnuchin added that, if the project is not compliant when it launches, it could result in action from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which is under the purview of the Treasury.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is slated to testify about the project before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee at a hearing entitled \u201cAn Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors.\u201d", "description": "The Libra Association has formed a five-member board and set ground rules for its governance today at a meeting in Switzerland", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80ZWQ2MTZhZDNlNGU0ODg5MWM0MTlmYzZkMjk1ZDA0Zi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
