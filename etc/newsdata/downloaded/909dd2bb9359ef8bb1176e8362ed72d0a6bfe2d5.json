The FISA court, also called the FISC, considers orders for surveillance in a manner that emulates the issuing of warrants. But critics call the court a rubber-stamp body, pointing to its history of approving about 98% of the roughly 1,600 to 1,700 applications it receives each year.\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz informed congressional leaders by letter last month that he had completed a draft of his report on the Page order, which was approved in 2016 and renewed three times in 2017. With its release expected this month once redactions are completed, the report is expected at the very least to cite weaknesses in the applications.\n\n\u201cI can report categorically that the inspector general has found that all four FISA warrants were illegal,\u201d Joe diGenova, a former U.S. attorney and vocal Republican, said recently in an interview with Washington radio station WMAL. \u201cThey were based on false information supplied to the FISA Court.\"\n\nA highly redacted copy of the first application for FISA surveillance orders on Page made public last year appears to show multiple irregularities. That October 2016 application gave great weight to information in the \u201cSteele dossier\u201d \u2013 a collection of memos alleging ties between the Trump campaign and Russia -- without clearly indicating that it was an opposition research document paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. That application also suggested that the dossier\u2019s claims had been independently verified by referring to a 2016 Yahoo News article that, it did not inform the court, had been based on information leaked from the dossier.\n\nPresiding Judge Rosemary Collyer approved the first application. And the FBI continued to use the dossier in its three FISA application renewals, approved by three different judges on the court, even though former FBI Director James B. Comey had described its allegations as \u201csalacious and unverified.\u201d It included claims that Trump had once paid hookers to urinate on a Moscow hotel bed once used by President Obama and that Page had been promised up to 19% of the Russian oil giant Rosneft \u2013 which would be worth billions \u2013 were he to convince Trump, if elected president, to remove Western sanctions against Russia.\n\nDepartment of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz: He's expected to open a window onto the FISA surveillance court.\n\nNevertheless, the warrant provided the government with far-ranging authority to spy on Page. Intelligence gathered from a foreign intelligence wiretap differs sharply from what is picked up through a domestic criminal surveillance warrant under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.\n\nFISA orders authorize constant collection with later sorting of evidence, while a Title III warrant is restricted to an \u201cears on/ears off\u201d pattern in which only material of potential relevance to a criminal case gets collected. FISA orders allow the government to cast a wide net, empowering agents to collect communications from anyone in contact with the target as well as people communicating with those contacts.\n\nFISA orders also permit the government to use \"inadvertently acquired\" domestic communications that include usable intelligence, information on criminal activity, threats, or encrypted data. Data collected on American citizens from any \u201cU.S.-based machine\u201d \u2013 a vague term that encompasses a broad range of electronic devices \u2013 can be retained for or up to five years. Because information gathered under FISA orders rarely gets used in a criminal case, the subject of the surveillance almost never knows it took place.\n\nThe window Horowitz is expected to open onto the secretive court raises a question that goes well beyond conservative circles and Trump partisans. What if the irregularities in the applications for surveillance of Carter Page were not so irregular, and U.S. citizens are routinely being wiretapped on flimsy national security pretexts?\n\nCritics of the Trump-Russia investigation are not the only ones raising questions about the process by which the 11-judge court approves national security surveillance of U.S. citizens.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, and other civil rights advocates call out the FISA Court for its secretive rulings. They argue that it is too cozy with government authorities and that its procedures, according to a Brennan Center report, \u201cresemble neither the granting of warrants nor the ordinary adversarial process for reviewing a challenge to the constitutionality of an agency\u2019s program.\u201d\n\nRosemary Collyer, who has presided over the 11-judge FISA court since May 2016. She approved the initial Carter Page spy order.\n\nAlthough thousands of warrants are approved each year, the public becomes aware of them only \u201c10 or 20 times a year [when] the Justice Department may file notice in a criminal case that direct or indirect FISA material is being used,\u201d Patrick Toomey, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, told RealClearInvestigations. \u201cEven when the government does disclose it, the defendant never gets to see the FISA application, never gets a clear view of what the government used: electronic, search of a house, search of a hard drive. There is very little visibility into what factual showing the government made in obtaining the order. The defendant is deprived of access to the application that was submitted to the F.I.S.A. court.\u201d\n\nThe late former FISA judge James Robertson condemned \u201cmission creep\u201d wherein Justice Department lawyers as well as staff of the FBI, CIA, and National Security Agency have come to rely on FISA orders for approval of surveillance that would be more properly approved through Title III criminal warrants, or not approved at all.\n\nIn building their case against two Detroit gas station attendants charged in 2018 with running a cash-for-food-stamps ring, prosecutors revealed last year that they had gathered evidence through electronic surveillance approved under FISA. The case has led to one guilty plea, but the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the lawyer for remaining defendant Nassif Sami Daher are demanding the government state the reason for the order, pointing out that the scam involved only fraud of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and that Daher was not charged with national security-related crimes.\n\nFISA judges are appointed by the chief justice of the United States to staggered seven-year terms. At present the court seats two women and nine men with an average age of 67; the oldest, James Parker Jones of the Western District of Virginia, is 79; the youngest, James Emanuel Boasberg of the District of Columbia, is 56. Four live in Washington, D.C., or Virginia, with others coming from Florida, Mississippi, New Jersey, Oregon, Kentucky, Maine, and Illinois.\n\nThe FISA court occupies an annex of the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse in Washington.\n\nMost, according to attorneys familiar with the court, continue to work in their home districts. But once every 11 weeks, each of the 11 judges serves a one-week stint as the sole judge on the FISA Court, which occupies an annex in Washington\u2019s E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse. The court has a clerk, and its presiding judge has duties similar to those of the chief judge of a district court.\n\nIn 2013, then-Presiding Judge Reggie Walton wrote a description of court procedures for the U.S. Senate. \u201cUpon the Court's receipt of a proposed application for an order under FISA, a member of the Court's legal staff reviews the application and evaluates whether it meets the legal requirements under the statute,\u201d he said. \u201cAs part of this evaluation, a Court attorney will often have one or more telephone conversations with the government to seek additional information and/or raise concerns about the application. A Court attorney then prepares a written analysis of the application for the duty judge, which includes an identification of any weaknesses, flaws, or other concerns.\u201d\n\nWalton\u2019s letter indicated that most discussion of applications for surveillance orders occurs between staff attorneys and attorneys from the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. Court staff and U.S. attorneys are in daily secure telephone contact, and many decisions are made through written submissions only, without a hearing.\n\nThe workload of judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court appears to be heavy.\n\nCarter Page: The first surveillance application targeting him was 66 pages; the last, 101.\n\nIn 2016, a typical recent year, the court ruled on 1,752 applications -- an average of almost 34 per week. A letter to Congress from the Administrative Office of the United States Court reported that 1,378 of those orders were granted without modifications, 339 were modified, 26 were denied in part, and only nine applications were denied in full.\n\n\u201cAs you saw with the Carter Page stuff, these are lengthy applications,\u201d said Toomey \u2013 the first Page application was 66 pages, the last was 101 pages. \u201cYou don\u2019t see written submissions in a formal hearing, where there is a court reporter present and everything\u2019s recorded. There is an informality that enters into both sides of the process. The court gets a draft copy or a read copy of the application. And my understanding is that there\u2019s often an extensive informal back-and-forth between clerks and U.S. attorneys.\u201d\n\nThis close coordination between government attorneys and the judges charged with overseeing them is one of the reasons the workings of the court need to become more transparent, Toomey said. He also pointed to new communication technologies and new types of surveillance including bulk collection and warrantless collection of Americans\u2019 international communications.\n\nSeveral attorneys who know the court, speaking on and off the record for this article, downplayed many of these concerns.\n\n\u201cThe court itself was a result of a policy judgment Congress made: Let\u2019s leave it to the judges,\u201d David Kris, founder of Culper Partners consulting firm, told RealClearInvestigations.\n\nKris, a former assistant U.S. attorney general for the National Security Division, noted that prior to the creation of the court in 1978, national security intelligence gathering on U.S. citizens was not subject to any judicial scrutiny at all.\n\n\u201cThe prior practice was just to do this surveillance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you see the FISA court as an excessive limit or inadequate depends on where you start.\u201d\n\nThe court, which now hosts a generally informative web page, has become more open and more independent from the Department of Justice since the middle of last decade. Kris noted that the court used to meet in the Department of Justice\u2019s own building, before moving in 2009 to its current secure location in the Prettyman courthouse. Other experts point out that the court\u2019s low rate of application denials is not substantially different from that of Title III courts, where judges also work informally with police officers and prosecutors to tailor acceptable warrant applications.\n\n\"When the government wants a search warrant, it makes an ex parte application to the judge \u2013 there\u2019s nobody on the other side even in an ordinary criminal case,\" said American University law professor Jennifer Daskal, a former counsel to the assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice. \"That makes sense \u2013 otherwise the government would be tipping off the target of the investigation. The judge then reviews the application to make sure there is sufficient evidence for a warrant.\"\n\nFormer FISA Presiding Judge Reggie Walton: defender of the court.\n\nNo FISA attorneys considered the workload of judges to be excessive. Robertson, who quit his seat on the court in 2005 and became a prominent critic, did not list overwork among his objections.\n\n\u201cThe majority of applications submitted to the Court are handled on a seven-day cycle, by a judge sitting on a weekly duty schedule,\u201d Walton wrote in his 2013 Senate letter. \u201cApplications that are novel or more complex are sometimes handled on a longer time-line, usually require additional briefing, and are assigned by the Presiding Judge based on judges' availability.\u201d\n\nWalton took special aim at charges that the FISA Court approves too many applications. \"The annual statistics,\" he wrote, \"[which are] frequently cited in press reports as a suggestion that the Court's approval rate of applications is over 99% -- reflect only the number of final applications submitted to and acted on by the Court. These statistics do not reflect the fact that many applications are altered prior to final submission or even withheld from final submission entirely, often after an indication that a judge would not approve them.\"\n\nThis leaves open the question of whether the Carter Page application was uniquely flawed, a result of anti-Trump groupthink in the Justice Department, or perhaps a fully legitimate application that will pass the inspector general\u2019s scrutiny.", "description": "A pending report on the government surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page may shed light on a vital question: Has the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court become a tool used by...", "authors": ["October", "Ap Photo Jacquelyn Martin", "U.S. Government Wikimedia", "Ap Photo Susan Walsh", "Ap Photo J.
