Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Citigroup met in Dubai to kick-start work on the gigantic offering.\n\nNews of the weekend attack sent money streaming into safe haven assets Monday morning, and industry experts questioned the security of Aramco's assets and the confidence of its future shareholders.\n\n\"Saturday's attacks raise the fear of future attacks in a very real way for equities investors,\" Ellen Wald, president of Transversal Consulting and author of the book \"Saudi, Inc.\" told CNBC via email Sunday.\n\n\"Those familiar with the company know that Aramco has been prepared for this for a very long time, but it likely is not something already priced into the opinions of the typical fund.\"\n\nRiyadh has not offered a timeline for the recovery of all of Aramco's production capacity, a central factor to the direction of oil prices.
