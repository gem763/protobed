Player Needred replicated everything a concert hall should have, from scaffolding for lights to the decorated ceiling. I especially like the grand entrance, which leads to two staircases for the lower level and upper level seating. Needred uploaded a video showing off their efforts:\n\nNeedred said on Reddit that they\u2019ve been working on this build since the game was still in the No Man\u2019s Sky Next update, which was introduced in July 2018.\n\nThe amount of items needed to pull off this build has taken a toll on Needred\u2019s framerate, but the concert hall is a remarkable space nonetheless. Maybe one day, No Man\u2019s Sky will be able to support a thousand players at once, and we can sell out the venue while listening to some space beats.", "description": "A No Man\u2019s Sky player built a concert hall, and the level of detail is just astounding.", "authors": ["Leah Williams", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/qy6wrenevpy2xihvcmel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
