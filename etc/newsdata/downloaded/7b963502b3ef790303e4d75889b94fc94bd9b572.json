Markus became a father for the first time last week as he \u00adwelcomed daughter Layla, who was born via a surrogate.\n\nThe lads once worked on hit song Against All Odds with Mariah Carey who is known for her skimpy outfits.\n\nBut Markus said: \u201cWith my daughter I\u2019m already thinking, will I let her watch that?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to look at pop stars differently now that I am going to be the father of a young girl.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m not going to be letting her go to certain concerts.\n\nNicky \u00adadded: \u201cIf you go to a Rihanna \u00adconcert, she is probably going to be wearing very little clothes and it is all very \u00adsexual. So at what age do you allow your daughter to experience those kinds of visuals? Little Mix are the same, they are very provocative.\u201d\n\nBut the group reckon it is \u00adharder for women than men in the music industry.\n\nShane said: \u201cWomen definitely get judged a lot more for their appearance. Being a woman, it\u2019s a harsher world full stop.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe singers \u2013 who are about to release new album Spectrum \u2013 praise Little Mix\u2019s Jesy Nelson for speaking about her battle with mental health.\n\nEarlier this month she told how online bullying following her \u00adappearance on X Factor drove her to the depths. Markus said: \u201cJesy is a very positive role model. Children need to know that \u00adeveryone goes through it.\n\n\u201cSomething has to change about the \u00adlegality of these \u00adwebsites. They will have to bring restrictions.\u201d\n\nHe also told of the pressures of coming out as gay after bring brought up in a Catholic \u00advillage in Ireland.\n\n\u201cI fell into depression. I have gone to very dark places in my life because of growing up with my sexuality. It was a big journey,\u201d he said.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIt is very common for young gay people to have \u00addepression, it goes hand in hand. I know \u00adpeople close to me who have tried to commit suicide.\u201d\n\nBut he is proud of his country, which legalised gay marriage in 2015.\n\n\u201cIf I had told my 13-year-old self where Ireland would be today, I simply wouldn\u2019t have believed it,\u201d said Markus. The lads reckon pop stars have it much tougher in America.\n\nThey cite Justin Bieber \u2019s \u00adrecent admissions about his battle with mental health after finding fame so young.\n\n(Image: Sonja Horsman)\n\nNicky, 40, says: \u201cYou go from having a normal job straight to being a multi-millionaire in America. Over here it takes years. They put them on this pedestal but here we can just go home to our local village pub.\u201d\n\nKian, 39, adds: \u201cIn America, they say \u2018here comes the talent\u2019 and separate you off as a different person, it is really unhealthy. What you do, in terms of your job, can either help you in a good way and keep you out of depression or it can do the opposite.\n\n\u201cNo matter how successful you are it can put you into \u00addepression. That is what \u00adhappened with Justin Bieber \u2013 a superstar since he was 16.\u201d\n\nWestlife, who have sold more than 45 million studio albums and had 14 No1 UK singles, return with their first ever Wembley Stadium show next August with support acts James Morrison and All Saints. A \u00adreunion with ex-bandmate Brian McFadden has been ruled out.\n\nShane, 40, said: \u201cThis show is going to be the best of our lives. We can\u2019t wait.\u201d But nothing will beat when they went on tour with Mariah Carey, 49.\n\nMarkus, 39, said: \u201cMariah invited us to come to her friend\u2019s flat in London. We put on MTV and all the other divas were \u00adcoming on and everyone was talking about it, \u2018What do you think of this one. What do you think of that one?\u2019 Me and Nicky were like, \u2018What the f***?\u2019 She is THE diva.\u2019\u201d\n\nTalking about diva antics, Shane \u00adremembers once splashing out on a \u00a32,000 Gucci coat \u2013 Keanu Reeves Matrix style.\n\nHe says: \u201cI bought a long coat back in 99. I thought it was the bee\u2019s knees, now it is like a Batman jacket when I think about it. I only wore it once or twice. The long jacket made me look small. I thought it was so cool. I still have it.\u201d\n\n*New single My Blood is released on October 18 and Spectrum, left, is out next month.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The foursome \u2013 Shane Filan, Markus Feehily, Kian Egan and Nicky Byrne \u2013 are all proud \u00adparents.", "authors": ["Halina Watts", "Image", "Getty", "Pa", "Sonja Horsman"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466684.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Westlife-ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
