He vowed to change the status quo that allowed for people, like the Clintons and other elites, two systems of justice and opportunities for enrichment by raiding the cookie jar with corrupt schemes.\n\nDemocrats and Never-Trumpers did not like Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension and his promises at all. Really, they did not, and still do not, like those who support Mr. Trump, either.\n\nSo, Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign actually colluded with foreign agents, claimed that it was the Russians\u2019 fault that she was defeated. With the help of deep-state elites, several investigations were commenced into the Trump campaign and his administration. The attempt was to find something \u2014 anything \u2014 to remove President Trump from office.\n\nWe ended up with the Mueller investigation that included a team of 19 lawyers, most of whom were anti-Trump acolytes. There were 40 investigators spending more than $30 million in taxpayer dollars, that produced hundreds of witness interviews, millions of pages of documents and proof that there was no collusion, cooperation, coordination or conspiracy between Russians and the Trump campaign.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, New York Democrat, wouldn\u2019t take the report as conclusive. The report he had anxiously awaited debunked his narrative, but he still wanted to reopen the investigation. People like Rep. Eric Swalwell, California Democrat, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, California Democrat, still clung to their belief that there was a there there, when there wasn\u2019t.\n\nIn dismay, the Democrats have attempted to gain support for impeachment with a host of trumped-up charges that end up being exposed as utter nonsense.\n\nThe American people have been subjected to three years of hatred being spewed by the left that has included the Russian hoax, claims of obstruction of justice and several other zany allegations \u2014 which have been completely destroyed.\n\nNow we get the wandering Ukrainian fable. Never has a single phone call provided so much hope to Trump Derangement Syndrome-infected Democrats as President Trump\u2019s rather innocuous conversation with newly-elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThis one started with a mysterious \u201cWhistleblower,\u201d who claimed the conversation included multiple threats and bribes by the president. It was \u201cterrifying.\u201d Then the unthinkable happened. President Trump released the transcript of the call and the \u201cWhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint. Immediately, the new narrative was ruined. And, it was demonstrated that this \u201cwhistleblower\u201d doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d at all.\n\nThe credibility of the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d was blown. Much of what the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d said was inaccurate. The \u201cwhistleblower, and most of his sources, had no firsthand knowledge of anything.\n\nMoreover, there was no extortion or promises. Mr. Zelensky and his foreign minister acknowledged that.\n\nFirst the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d credibility, and then the whole story itself, was emasculated by the truth.\n\nYou have to give the Democrats credit. When their narratives collapse, they invent a new one. Their misrepresentation of the phone conversation and the president\u2019s inquiry into Ukrainian corruption and potential influence in our 2016 election are somehow being conflated into a most amorphous allegation of \u201cabuse of power.\u201d\n\nUnlike the Trump administration, the Obama administration refused to provide lethal military aid at all to Ukraine. Further, former Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold funding to Ukraine, unless an investigator was fired because he was looking into corruption of a company involved with Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nThese so-called corrupt practices of President Trump have been shamelessly and skillfully made to look nefarious by the impeachment-obsessed left.\n\nIf the American public is ever able to see what is going on in the Soviet-style hearings, they will be outraged at the manipulation of facts and downright abuse of the truth that Democrats have used in their coup attempt. Thus, the slowest-moving coup in world history persists, not out of love for country, but out of hatred for the president and those who support and voted for him.\n\n\u2022 Andy Biggs is a Republican U.S. representative from Arizona.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
