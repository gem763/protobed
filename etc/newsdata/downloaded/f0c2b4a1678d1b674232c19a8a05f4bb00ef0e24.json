These seven cordless brad nailers are a good case in point. Nowadays, you don\u2019t have to attach an air hose or drag a heavy compressor around wherever you need to install 18-gauge brads. Just pop on a battery and you\u2019re all set \u2014 the nailers are completely self-contained.\n\nI was skeptical of them at first, because I\u2019ve used lighter weight and smaller pneumatic nailers all along. But after putting 1,000 brads through each of these test tools, I see the advantages. Cordless brad nailers are entirely game for driving brads into tough hardwood, delicate trim moldings and veneered plywood. There\u2019s no tangled air hose, no loud compressor kicking in, no burst of exhaust air to blow dust in your face, and plenty of battery run time to get most DIY or wood projects done long before the charge fizzles.\n\nYou can buy several of these guns \u201cbare,\u201d too, then use the batteries you already own from other tools to power them, saving money and foregoing another charger.\n\nWith five of these nailers, there\u2019s a second or two of \u201cramp up\u201d time after you squeeze the trigger before the nailer drives the brad. But, that brief delay really isn\u2019t a big deal. You\u2019ll get used to it quickly. I did.\n\nEven if you\u2019re a diehard pneumatics user, read on and imagine the possibility of going cordless, instead.\n\nDeWALT DC608K 18-volt\n\nStreet Price: $279 (kit) / $229 (bare tool)\n\nWeight (with battery): 7.5 lbs.\n\nBrad Lengths: 5/8\u2033-2\u2033\n\nFeatures: Two firing modes, tool-free jam release, carry case\n\nBattery (included): One 18V XRP\u2122 NiCad and charger\n\nWeb / Phone: www.dewalt.com / 800-433-9258\n\nDeWALT powers this brad nailer with an included 18-volt NiCad \u2014 and that chemistry is a throwback, considering the domination of lithium-ion these days. But, there\u2019s a reason for it: DeWALT remains loyal to contractors that are heavily invested in NiCad-powered tools. And, this rugged nailer should be appealing to them.\n\nWith the battery freshly charged, the gun fired 100, 1-1\u20444\u2033 brads deftly into pine crown molding without leaving dents behind. Then I drove 525 more 2\u2033 brads into some 8/4 poplar test lumber before the battery finally petered out. Just because lithium-ion is sweeping the cordless world, 625 nails proves that NiCad power can still go quite a long distance.\n\nOnce the charge was replenished, I put the DC608K to work again, driving a total of 800 brads into poplar and 100 more 1-1\u20444\u2033 brads into a 3/4\u2033 maple plywood corner joint. The tool didn\u2019t falter.\n\nThere\u2019s just one oddity about this gun: when you depress the contact element on the nailer\u2019s nose (a standard safety feature) against a workpiece, the tool\u2019s motor starts running. It continues after you squeeze the trigger, too. It does that, in part, to spin up a flywheel, which engages a driver blade that punches the brad into the wood. But, with other guns the motor starts and stops with the trigger squeeze. Some battery charge seems wasted here this way.\n\nNiCad is typically a heavier battery than lithium-ion, but the weight didn\u2019t impact the DC608K\u2019s balance in hand \u2014 it\u2019s very comfortable to hold and use, even overhead, and its 7 lb. weight is about average for the test group.\n\nThe nailer has both sequential and contact-actuation modes, which means you can fire a single brad with each trigger squeeze or a series of them by just bumping the contact element, repeatedly. However, it has no dry-fire lockout, so this nailer will continue to fire the driver blade even after the magazine is empty. That\u2019s a useful feature this gun deserves but lacks.\n\nFor other extras, the DC608K has a pair of yellow lights for working in shadows and a tool-free jam release. It comes with safety glasses and a hard carry case. At $279, I think it\u2019s fairly priced.\n\nMakita XNB01Z 18-volt LXT\n\nStreet Price: $249 (bare tool)\n\nWeight (with battery): 7.8 lbs.\n\nBrad Lengths: 5/8\u2033-2\u2033\n\nFeatures: Two firing modes, dry-fire lockout, safety lock\n\nBattery (Provided for Test): 4.0Ah LXT lithium-ion and charger\n\nWeb / Phone: www.makitatools.com / 800-462-5482\n\nIf you\u2019re already invested in Makita, this XNB01Z is a \u201cbare\u201d option that will accept any LXT\u00ae lithium-ion 18-volt battery you own \u2014 Makita provided a 4.0Ah sample and charger for this test. And just one charge powered through 1,000 fasteners I sank into poplar, pine and plywood. This gun shot and set brads consistently and with gusto.\n\nMy favorite detail, among many standard features, is its sharply tapered nailing tip: you can place nails as accurately as a pin nailer with it. I had no trouble targeting pencil marks and crown molding shadow lines. On the grounds of nailing precision, this gun tops them all.\n\nBut, the Makita had a big drawback for me, which my wrist reported: it\u2019s noticeably imbalanced. The weight of this gun, with a batter installed, is mostly behind the grip and on the battery end. The nose end distributes very little of the weight forward. If you\u2019re only firing a few brads, you may not feel it at first, but holding the gun horizontally in a normal nailing position causes your wrist to correct for the tail heaviness, and that became really fatiguing when driving 800 brads continuously into poplar. My wrist faded long before the test ended.\n\nFor features, this gun has dry-fire lockout, a safety lock near the trigger, both sequential and \u201cbump fire\u201d modes and a white LED that helps light the nailing area. Its internal motor hums quietly before each shot and ran cool throughout testing.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to remove three Torx screws to open the nosepiece if a nail jams, but the gun never misfired.\n\nSo, all in all, the $249 XNB01Z was a mixed blessing: it\u2019s accurate and powerful but ergonomically unforgiving in hand during sustained use.\n\nMilwaukee M18 FUEL 18-volt\n\nStreet Price: $379 (2740-21CT kit) / $329 (bare tool)\n\nWeight (with battery): 7 lbs.\n\nBrad Lengths: 5/8\u2033-2-1\u20448\u2033\n\nFeatures: Two firing modes, dry-fire lockout, brushless motor\n\nBattery (included): One 2.0Ah M18 RedLithium and charger\n\nWeb / Phone: www.milwaukeetool.com / 800-729-3878\n\nJust this summer, Milwaukee unveiled its M18 FUEL\u2122 Brad Nailer, which comes with an M18\u2122 RedLithium\u2122 2.0Ah battery that powers many \u201cred\u201d tool options.\n\nSqueeze the trigger, and this nailer grabs your attention fast: it fires instantly and with a brisk recoil. The absence of \u201cramp up\u201d time is due to the fact that the M18 employs a unique drive system. The tool\u2019s motor and piston compresses pure nitrogen inside a sealed cylinder. That provides an immediate source of energy to propel the driver blade.\n\nMilwaukee includes a brushless motor here. These state-of-the-art motors are compact, run cooler and use battery energy more efficiently than standard carbon-brush motors do.\n\nIn testing, the M18 dispatched 1,000 1-1\u20444\u2033 and 2\u2033 brads with only a few nails remaining less than fully set. The gun\u2019s contact element left some small dents on pine crown molding, due mostly, I think, to the tool\u2019s recoil at the tip. There were a few misfires too, but the M18\u2019s flip-lever nose release made them easy to remove from the magazine.\n\nThat same big jam-release assembly makes it harder to sight nail positions if you\u2019re looking down over the front of the tool, but I found that my accuracy improved pretty quickly. In hand, this nailer balances comfortably.\n\nIt took around 800 nails to drain the RedLithium battery of charge (impressive!), and from clip to clip, the gun has a dry-fire lockout feature that stops the action within the last four or five fasteners. Milwaukee also has engineered thermal overload protection into the design: if the electronics get too warm, the gun shuts down until it cools off. Milwaukee says that feature will help extend the overall life of the tool.\n\nYou can switch between sequential or bump-fire modes using a push-button selector in back. And, a rear-positioned LED light provides a bit of aid beside the gun when nailing in a dark place.\n\nAt $379, this M18 FUEL kit also includes a canvas bag.\n\nPORTER-CABLE PCC790LA 20V MAX*\n\nStreet Price: $199 (kit) / $149 (bare tool)\n\nWeight (with battery): 5.9 lbs.\n\nBrad Lengths: 5/8\u2033-2\u2033\n\nFeatures: Tool-free jam release, safety lock, LED task lights\n\nBattery (included): One 20V MAX* lithium-ion and charger\n\nWeb / Phone: www.portercable.com / 888-848-5175\n\nMaybe brad nailing isn\u2019t a regular task, or your modest tool budget must be obeyed. Fair enough. PORTERCABLE\u2019s PCC790LA may be just the kit for you. For $199, its flywheel-based drive system and 1.5Ah battery were up to snuff for setting brads into all my test lumber neatly and effectively. The tool\u2019s quiet motor helped sink 400 nails before the battery needed recharging, and there was only one jam in 1,000, which cleared easily through the flip-open nose release.\n\nThere\u2019s no dry-fire lockout here, unfortunately, or bump-fire mode, but the magazine\u2019s viewing window will tell you when the clip is low. The gun has ample overmolding and pleasant balance. It weighs just 5.9 lbs \u2014 the lightest here.\n\nA plastic contact tip prevents marring workpieces, and twin LED lights help guide your way. Among some stiff pro-tool competition, P-C\u2019s value-priced brad nailer delivered a good showing.\n\nRIDGID R09890B Hyperdrive 18-volt\n\nStreet Price: $229 (bare tool)\n\nWeight (with battery): 7.9 lbs.\n\nBrad Lengths: 5/8\u2033-2-1\u20448\u2033\n\nFeatures: Two firing modes, dry-fire lockout, brushless motor\n\nBattery (Provided for Test): 5.0Ah lithium-ion and charger\n\nWeb / Phone: www.ridgid.com / 800-474-3443\n\nAt 7.9 lbs., this orange and gray nailer has a hefty feel in hand, but RIDGID balances the weight well. It wasn\u2019t unwieldy, even when fastening crown molding overhead. Lavishly overmolded, the soft rubber lends a comfy grip.\n\nRIDGID packs the R09890B with many desirable features: two firing modes, dry-fire lockout, a brushless motor and tool-free jam release. A slender button behind the trigger lights up a front LED, so you\u2019ve got improved visibility as soon as your hand wraps the grip. It\u2019s the best task lighting feature among this test group.\n\nThis gun\u2019s Hyperdrive\u2122 energy system uses two pistons that move in opposite directions to form a vacuum inside a chamber. When you squeeze the trigger, the motor pulls one piston down to draw a vacuum, then a moment later, ambient air drives the top piston down to create the nailing force. You can dial the air pressure up or down with a slider switch on top.\n\nIt was plenty powerful for my nailing tests. Brads set and countersunk every time, and the gun operated quietly with almost no recoil. RIDGID provided a 5.0Ah battery for this bare tool; on the first charge the battery still had gas in the tank after driving 1,000 nails continuously.\n\nFor $229, this gun comes with a canvas bag and 500 1-1\u20444\u2033 brads. RIDGID backs it with free replacement of seals, pistons and driver blades for life. While not the least expensive bare unit here, the R09890B proved to be an exceptional tool.\n\nRYOBI P320 One+ AirStrike 18-volt\n\nStreet Price: $129 (bare tool)\n\nWeight (with battery): 6.9 lbs.\n\nBrad Lengths: 5/8\u2033-2\u2033\n\nFeatures: Two firing modes, dry-fire lockout, grip LED\n\nBattery (Provided for Test): 4.0Ah lithium-ion and charger\n\nWeb / Phone: www.ryobitools.com / 800-525-2579\n\nIf you have other RYOBI One+\u2122 tools already, $129 will add a brad nailer to your cordless options \u2014 and it\u2019s a dandy! In fact, given all the standard features that come with it, I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s priced so economically. The nimbly balanced P320 includes both sequential and bump-fire modes, and it stops firing when you\u2019re down to five or so brads to protect the driver blade. It also shares RIDGID\u2019s grip-activated light styling, with two bright LEDs that shine down in front.\n\nHere\u2019s how RYOBI\u2019s AirStrike\u2122 system works: a single piston inside pressurizes ambient air with each trigger squeeze, and that\u2019s what drives the brad. The motor is quiet and the ramp-up time is brief. This nailer sinks even long brads into thick hardwood without unpleasant recoil \u2014 and mine didn\u2019t dent delicate pine trim or veneered plywood, either. You can fine tune how deeply to countersink those nails with a large air pressure dial on top \u2014 it\u2019s unique to RYOBI. Plus, there\u2019s a second contact element adjuster wheel in front to set countersink depths. (The other guns are similarly appointed.)\n\nIf the nailer should happen to jam, you\u2019ll be able to clear the brad by popping open a tool-free release on the nose. My nailer didn\u2019t clog up once over 10 clips of 100 brads. RYOBI includes 500, 1-1\u20444\u2033 brads with the tool.\n\nSENCO F-18 Fusion 18-volt\n\nStreet Price: $329 (kit)\n\nWeight (with battery): 6 lbs.\n\nBrad Lengths: 5/8\u2033-2-1\u20448\u2033\n\nFeatures: Two firing modes, dry-fire lockout, tool-free jam release\n\nBattery (included): One 1.5Ah lithium-ion and charger\n\nWeb / Phone: www.senco.com / 800-543-4596\n\nSENCO was first to offer a nitrogen-based drive system in this \u201cFusion\u201d line several years ago. It functions similarly to Milwaukee\u2019s M18 FUEL drive. And, like that gun, this nailer fires revolver-fast, with about the same amount of blunt recoil. But even with a powerful nailing force, the F-18 left behind tidy nail holes without dents.\n\nSENCO says its sealed nitrogen \u201cvessel\u201d should last 100,000 nailing cycles before needing any service.\n\nWhile quite tall, the Fusion is about a pound lighter than the M18 FUEL. It\u2019s slender and evenly weighted from front to back.\n\nPushing an illuminated switch allows you to choose between single-shot or contact actuation. I appreciated how, unlike other nailers here, the Fusion will shoot every single nail in a clip before engaging the dry-fire lockout feature; you won\u2019t be left with a little stick of four or five fasteners to get hung up inside the magazine when you load the next clip. It also shuts off when the 1.5Ah lithium-ion battery needs recharging but before nailing performance suffers. Nice.\n\nIn testing, the battery lasted through 700 brads and then needed topping up. SENCO says the included charger will replenish it to 80 percent in just 15 minutes.\n\nThe Fusion\u2019s contact element is located ahead of the nailing tip, which makes it a little harder to visually position nails than when it\u2019s behind the tip. But, you\u2019ll get the hang of it. And, its well placed front LED light helps you see your target better.\n\nPriced at about $50 under Milwaukee, SENCO\u2019s F-18 Fusion kit with canvas bag edged it out by a nose in features and performance.", "description": "Woodworker's Journal Senior Editor Chris Marshall gets fired up about testing today\u2019s battery-powered 18-gauge brad nailers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.woodworkersjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/18-Gauge-Brad-Nailers-Lead-1.jpg", "published_at": "2016-09-30"}
