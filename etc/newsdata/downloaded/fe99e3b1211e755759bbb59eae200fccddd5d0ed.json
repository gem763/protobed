REUTERS/Amit Dave/Files\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India expects to have formulated a policy within the next two weeks to attract foreign investment to its coal mining industry, the country\u2019s Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi said on Tuesday.\n\nSources told Reuters last month that the country planned to invite bids for coal mining blocks by the end of 2019. It is also creating a coal price index as part of plans to open the sector to outside investment.\n\n\u201cWe are formulating various policies within the coal ministry to attract foreign investment. Hopefully within a fortnight or a month\u2019s time we will come out with a policy,\u201d Joshi said at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek.\n\nIndia\u2019s recently concluded thermal coal mine auctions received a tepid response, with 15 out of 21 attracting fewer than three bidders. An industry source told Reuters none of 6 coking coal blocks received interest from at least 3 bidders, the minimum required for a mine to be allocated.\n\nJoshi said the government was looking to make investing in coal mines more attractive to bidders.\n\n\u201cWe have several small blocks which usually don\u2019t attract foreign investment. For that we need bigger blocks.\u201d\n\nJoshi said he expects India\u2019s coal demand to rise more than 21% from current levels to 1.2 billion tonnes in 2023, adding that coal would be necessary for the next three decades.", "description": "India expects to have formulated a policy within the next two weeks to attract foreign investment to its coal mining industry, the country's Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Promit Mukherjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441112067&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E12Q", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
