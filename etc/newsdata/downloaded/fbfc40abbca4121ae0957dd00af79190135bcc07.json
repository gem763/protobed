While I don't appreciate the dish as much as its fans, I love other types of fried fish. There's nothing delicate or subtle about fried fish, and it needs to be served with a strongly flavoured sauce.\n\nWith its balanced flavours of hot, sour, salty and sweet, this sauce is fantastic. If you have any leftover, serve it with other types of seafood or grilled meat.", "description": "I'm still searching for the ultimate British dish of fish and chips - I've tasted it at gastro pubs run by celebrity chefs as well as specialist shops that\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_cooking/public/d8/images/2019/10/18/mer49825585.jpg?itok=fPPrlWIl", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
