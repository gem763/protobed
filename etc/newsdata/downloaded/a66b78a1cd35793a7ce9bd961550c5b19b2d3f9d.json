Is it a \u201cstrange\u201d watch? We have an answer to this question only because we\u2019ve already seen other watches. We cannot with similar facility judge whether this is a \u201cstrange\u201d universe/multiverse, nor can we readily judge a particular origin story for that universe as strange, or not. We have no point of comparison, and furthermore I am not sure we can appeal to the physical laws that operate inside of this universe.\n\nTo many people, the branching multiverse seems bizarre, but \u201csteady state matter\u201d theories do not (even if they are false). I am suggesting that distinction cannot be upheld. You haven\u2019t seen a multiverse in Cleveland before, and so you scratch your head and call that science fiction. But you have seen stuff just sitting around on the sofa. I submit that is a cosmological bias, not the grounds for an insight into origin stories.\n\nIf we cannot judge the strangeness of the universe, or judge the strangeness of an origin story for the universe, that is itself strange. So we are always in the realm of the strange, it seems.\n\nOne major objection to theism is already taken off the table, namely the view of many non-believers that it is somehow absurd, mystical, Santa Claus-like, and so on.\n\nSo it\u2019s \u201cstrangeness all the way down.\u201d\n\nWhat then is the most focal \u201cstrange\u201d view on origins that we have?\n\nTo be sure, you might side against \u201cfocality\u201d as a standard for choosing amongst very strange views about origins. But now it seems we are on a turf where all kinds of doctrines stand a fighting chance.", "description": "", "authors": ["Someone The Other Side", "Dave Barnes", "Troll Me", "Stormy Dragon", "David Condon", "Nick Danger", "Jayson Virissimo", "P Burgos", "Eric Rasmusen", "Judson Frondorf"], "top_image": "http://marginalrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Blake.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-20"}
