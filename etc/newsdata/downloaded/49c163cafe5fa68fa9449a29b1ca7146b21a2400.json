Tequila is said to be his \u201cspirit of choice,\u201d according to Forbes, and it was he, along with Fazzalari and Edens, who headed up the tasting team when choosing the correct blend.\n\nHis influence may be more evident on the bottle, too. Jordan and Mark Smith, the vice president of Innovation Special Projects at Nike, reportedly worked closely on the design, which pays homage not only to the agave plant but also Jordan\u2019s jersey number, as it\u2019s designed with a \u201c23-degree angle.\u201d\n\n\"The sleek, contemporary and unique bottle is a glass sculpture of the agave leaf that highlights the liquid with a five-sided base, showcasing the Cincoro Fire Agave icon in the punt at a 23-degree angle, topped with a king's crown crystal stopper,\" a description reads.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nNow, Cincoro \u2014 the name was derived from the Spanish words for \u201cfive\u201d (cinco) and \u201cgold\u201d (oro) \u2014 is preparing for a nationwide launch in January following successful tests in four markets (and a current release in 12 markets), Forbes reports.
