That is a decision that you take, and no one can give you a deadline. You are the compass. You are the ones who moved the cabinet, and your movement, to be honest, is what led to the decision that you see today.\u201d\n\nCrowds still filled the streets after the speech as they had all weekend, when the mood, unlike the anger of the first two nights, was buoyant and electric with hope. Families and children gathered as people blasted music, draped themselves in the white, red and green flag, and chanted profanity-laced rhymes cursing out prominent officials across all parties and religious sects.\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, protesters broke into the abandoned Grand Theater of Beirut, one of the few remaining prewar monuments in the city center, and waves of people flocked inside the building.\n\nAD\n\nOn Saturday, Nahla, a grandmother in her 70s from Beirut\u2019s southern district watched the protest from the third floor of the building with astonishment.\n\n\u201cI was starting to lose hope,\u201d she said, wiping tears from her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019ve robbed us; they\u2019ve shattered our children\u2019s dreams and diminished the prospects of our grandchildren \u2014 I\u2019m glad that people have broken the barrier of fear.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the protesters filled every crook and cranny of downtown Beirut, as well as the streets of other major cities in this small country of about 4 million people. Major highways were blocked. A general strike was called, and banks, schools and universities were closed.\n\nAD\n\nSo far, four cabinet ministers from one party have resigned, including the minister of labor and the deputy prime minister, citing people\u2019s lack of faith in the political class. \u201cIf the government does not fall, we will keep a close watch on their work as members of the opposition,\u201d said Elie Khoury, foreign affairs adviser to Samir Geagea, the leader of the Lebanese Forces Party.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe doubt, however, that the government is going to survive this crisis. It has already lost the trust of the local population, as well as the international community,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the street over the weekend, as soldiers stood inches away from the protest blocking the road to the nearby Parliament, many of them struggled to maintain a straight face. Exchanging kisses on the cheek with one of the demonstrators, a grinning soldier whispered: \u201cBe safe \u2026 raise your voice and shout on our behalf.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "In the final hours of the prime minister\u2019s deadline to fix the country\u2019s economic crisis, people flooded the streets of major cities.", "authors": ["Sarah Dadouch", "Correspondent Covering The Middle East", "Asser Khattab"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8vvYIV-dx-x5lsTcsMt3Cuwk5-A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/64YKCZXUBYI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
