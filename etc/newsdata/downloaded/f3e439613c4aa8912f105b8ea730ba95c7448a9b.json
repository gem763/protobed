After buying a six-bedroom chalet at Loon Mountain, in Lincoln, for $680,000 in 2018, they spent $1.21 million on Black Bear Lodge, a 5,700-square-foot home about 40 miles east in the Mount Washington valley town of Glen in January.\n\n\u201cGlen is a log cabin home, which is unique and cool. It\u2019s very private and has beautiful views of Mount Attitash, and there\u2019s also shopping at the outlets,\u201d said Ms. Moreau, 45, a software designer who currently spends her time managing her children and her multiple homes. Whereas, \u201cthere are so many activities at Loon. For Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, they do crazy fireworks and have people ski down the mountain and make a loon out of torches.\u201d\n\nMountain Living in New Hampshire Come for the skiing, stay for the ski homes. Gosia and Mark Moreau bought Black Bear Lodge, a 5,700-square-foot log home in New Hampshire\u2019s Mount Washington valley for $1.21 million in January.

Jessica Webb for The Wall Street Journal\n\nDespite its reputation for icy slopes and punishing winters, the Granite State is drawing ski-home buyers with its mix of year-round recreational opportunities, its family-friendly vibe and easy access to restaurants and shopping. According to a study by Realtor.com, home sales in New Hampshire\u2019s White Mountains region grew 24% between January and May of 2019 compared with the same period last year.

Black Bear Lodge is the more remote of the two ski homes, with mountain views, its own movie theater and a playroom with bunk beds and a slide. The Loon mountain chalet is more convenient\u2014just 90 minutes from the Moreaus\u2019 home base\u2014and so close to the mountain that they can watch skiers swoop downhill from their living room. A shuttle bus to the ski lifts stops across the street from their house.\n\nBoth ski homes have proved solid investments. \u201cWe were renting the Loon house so much we barely got to use it last winter,\u201d Ms. Moreau said.\n\nA pioneer of ski tourism, New Hampshire was among the first states to offer European-style skiing schools, groomed trails and overhead wire-rope ski tows. In the late 1930s and 1940s, weekend \u201csnow trains\u201d ran between Boston and North Conway, N.H., near Cranmore Mountain, then one of largest ski resorts in the country.\n\nConvenience is still a draw. Most N.H. ski areas are near major highways and many are clustered close together. Cross-country and snowshoeing are popular, and there\u2019s growing interest in backcountry skiing at places like Baldface Knob in Chatham and Crescent Ridge Glade in Randolph.\n\nNew Hampshire Ski Homes for Sale Photo: Keller Williams Lakes & Mountains Realty $825,000\n\nBirch Ledge Road, Bartlett\n\n3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms With 2,200-square-feet of finished living space, the home has mountain views and is close to North Conway.

They can ski at Attitash on Saturday, King Pine on Sunday and Wildcat on Monday, and hit all those locations in less than an hour,\u201d said Diane McGregor, a real-estate broker with Badger Realty in Jackson.\n\nIn July, Vail Resorts , a Colorado-based company that owns 16 ski resorts across the U.S., announced the purchase of New Hampshire\u2019s Crotched Mountain, Attitash and Wildcat ski areas. The company acquired Mount Sunapee ski resort last year. Ms. McGregor expects the acquisition to boost home sales, largely because of its multi-mountain pass program.\n\nOther ski resorts are upping their game. Waterville Valley Resort is in the midst of a $7.5 million upgrade and expansion, with new trails, a renovated lodge and 500 new high-efficiency snow guns for snow-making. Two months ago, the resort announced the acquisition of 33 acres of commercial land in the town center, which it plans to develop with a hotel, retail spaces and a gondola to the mountain.\n\nCranmore Mountain Resort\u2019s new Kearsarge Brook condominium complex is part of a $50 million development plan that will add 106 condo units and 45,000-square-feet of new lodge space over the next six to eight years. Along with ski-in, ski-out access from its two- and three-bedroom condos, the complex has a four-season heated outdoor pool, fitness room and private locker room with mahogany storage cabinets. In the summer, there\u2019s a mountain adventure park and a zip line ride and new bicycle paths are under construction. The first 18 condo units sold out at prices ranging from $439,000 to $629,000. Another 19 units, with top prices of $729,000, will be completed by December of 2020.\n\nKatherine Morse, a doctor of anesthesia practice, and her husband James Morse, an emergency medicine physician, live with their three children in the coastal town of Rye. They bought a three-bedroom condo at Kearsarge Brook for over $600,000 in 2018.\n\nThe Morse\u2019s bunk room at their Kearsarge Brook condo.

All the trails wind back to a central area in the middle, so the kids can head off and then come back. And even if you don\u2019t ski, they have so many other amenities. It\u2019s becoming a one-stop kind of area.\u201d\n\nThe Morses have embraced New Hampshire\u2019s \u201cloud powder\u201d a local nickname for its icy slopes. Their children, ages 8, 9 and 11, are all enrolled in freestyle and pre-racing programs. \u201cThey\u2019re daredevils,\u201d Katherine Morse said. \u201cThey go downhill backward.\u201d\n\nFor some, the masochistic pleasures of skiing in the Granite State are a point of pride. Kevin Killourie, a real-estate agent and president of the Jackson Ski Touring Foundation, which maintains 60 groomed miles of Nordic trails in the White Mountains National Forest, takes a dim view of those who flee the state during sleet season.\n\n\u201cA friend of mine is going to Vail for February vacation,\u201d Mr. Killourie said. \u201cThat\u2019s a wimp.\u201d", "description": "Slippery slopes and frigid winters aren\u2019t discouraging buyers from planting their poles in the Granite State.", "authors": ["Amy Gamerman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107942/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
