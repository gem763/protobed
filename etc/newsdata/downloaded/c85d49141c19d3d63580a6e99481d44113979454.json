Photo: NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images\n\nAbout four minutes into the ER pilot, which aired 25 years ago this week, there is news of a building collapse in downtown Chicago. There are some fatalities and some critical injuries, and all of those critically injured are about to burst through the doors of the emergency room at County General Hospital. When the gurneys roll in, the cameras start rolling right behind them; one even stays parked behind the head of a patient on a stretcher as he\u2019s wheeled down hallways while nurse Wendy Goldman (Vanessa Marquez) tries to get the man\u2019s name and address.\n\nThis early sequence captures the chaos of working in a hospital. It also announces that ER is going to be a show that\u2019s constantly in motion, which, in 1994, was a pretty remarkable thing to see on television.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why ER became a huge, instant hit and remained one for a decade-plus. (The drama ended its run in 2009, after 15 seasons.) One is that the medical drama, when done right, will always find an audience. Certainly the cast of ER \u2014 which, in its early seasons, included Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle, Juliana Margulies, Eriq LaSalle, and some guy named George Clooney \u2014 was enormously appealing. But I would argue that the directorial style of the series is what hooked people and kept them coming back every week. The way the camera zipped from one moment to the next implied that something unexpected could happen at any time, and it often did. You didn\u2019t want to look away for a second or skip an episode. You might miss something.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s move\u201d is something the doctors on ER say frequently when they need to work quickly on a patient, but it was also the guiding principle behind how the series operated. You can see that in both the pilot, \u201c24 Hours,\u201d which aired on a Monday night as a two-hour event, and the first official episode, \u201cDay One,\u201d which aired three nights later in ER\u2019s permanent home, the Thursday 10 p.m. slot. Rod Holcomb, a veteran television director who had handled episodes of Quincy, Hill Street Blues, The Greatest American Hero, and China Beach, directed \u201c24 Hours.\u201d Mimi Leder, who got her TV directorial start with L.A. Law and later moved on to China Beach, directed \u201cDay One\u201d and five more episodes in the first season. Leder in particular became key to establishing the look and feel of ER under showrunner John Wells, and you can already see that look and feel developing in those first episodes.\n\nSteadicams were not commonly used in television in the early \u201990s, but they were central to ER and became a signature part of its approach, even if the average viewer wasn\u2019t necessarily aware of what how they were being used behind the scenes. When you picture ER, the first images that come to mind are probably of doctors working on a patient while shouting medical terms, as a camera swirls in circles around the operating table. That sense of fluidity was there from the beginning, even in smaller moments, because the cameras refused to just stay still.\n\nIn \u201c24 Hours,\u201d there\u2019s a moment when nurse manager Carol Hathaway (Margulies), having finally gotten a second to catch her breath, is walking slowly down the hall while her colleagues keep shouting questions at her. She\u2019s getting bombarded with \u201cHey, Carol!\u201d after every step she takes, and the relentlessness of that wouldn\u2019t feel nearly as overwhelming if the camera wasn\u2019t moving in front of her, capturing the nurses and medics who keep popping out of doorways seeking her guidance. It\u2019s also an important scene because later, Hathaway becomes the patient being wheeled into County General after she attempts suicide. The idea that life may be asking too much of her is hinted at, gently, in that brief but beautifully executed walk down the hall.\n\nSomething similar but even more stressful happens in \u201cDay One,\u201d when the camera follows Dr. Carter (Wyle), still a medical student, from assisting a group of food-poisoned wedding guests to a room nearby, where a patient appears to be flatlining. The camera then follows him back into the hallway, where it\u2019s clear that anyone who could possibly help him is occupied with an unruly patient and attempting to call security. Carter has to act quickly, grab a defibrillator, and use the paddles to shock the patient\u2019s heart back to a normal rhythtm. Again, the quickness with which Carter has to make a decision and then act on it is conveyed all the more powerfully because the camera is zooming along behind him, trying to keep up.\n\nThe kind of intricate filmmaking choreography required on ER made it look very different from much of what was on television at the time, and gave it an immediacy that is one of the reasons why the show still holds up as well as it does. But it wasn\u2019t just the obvious tracking shots that distinguished it. The camera shifted in other ways, too, between lovely wide shots \u2014 the one in \u201cDay One\u201d that captures Mark Greene (Edwards) walking toward Carter, his reflection captured in a rain puddle, is a real beauty \u2014 and extreme close-ups that proved the show wasn\u2019t just about racing around all the time. Sometimes it would slow down and zoom in really close, as it does in that Leder-directed episode when Mr. Franks, a man who\u2019s just lost his wife, sings to her. The camera stays so tight on Mr. Franks, played by the wonderful John Randolph, that his despair fills the screen. ER constantly signaled to us how easy it was to get distracted in an environment where everything\u2019s turning on a dime, but also that it\u2019s important to pay attention to the human consequences of what happens in that same environment.\n\nMr. Franks, played by John Randolph, in the ER episode \u201cDay One\u201d. Photo: Hulu\n\nER wasn\u2019t the first show whose visual sophistication made people compare it to watching a movie. Miami Vice did that. NYPD Blue did as well. But ER absolutely pushed the bar higher and its influence on the visual style of television has been felt ever since, on shows like The West Wing (ER did more than its share of walk-and-talks before Aaron Sorkin adapted that approach), Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and Friday Night Lights, just to name a few. These days when we watch a drama, we expect it to have the kinetic visual energy that ER possessed. Just look at the shows nominated for Emmys this year for outstanding drama and, for that matter, outstanding comedy. Game of Thrones, Better Call Saul, Russian Doll, Barry, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Pose, Succession: All of them have, on more than one occasion, featured scenes with long fluid camerawork that conveys forward momentum.\n\nThe visual style of ER isn\u2019t solely responsible for all of that. But it certainly had an impact. In 1994, when the show debuted, its \u201clet\u2019s move\u201d sensibility didn\u2019t just draw us into our televisions. It made us expect more from them.", "description": "On ER\u2019s 25th anniversary, a celebration of the NBC medical drama\u2019s pioneering visual style.
