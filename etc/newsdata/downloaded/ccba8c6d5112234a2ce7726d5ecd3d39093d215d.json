Just what the Indians need.\n\nCleveland entered trailing Minnesota by five games in the AL Central and were 1\u00bd games behind Tampa Bay for the second AL wild card.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep battling,\u201d rookie Oscar Mercado said after homering. \u201cWe have a chance to do something special. We can\u2019t get down on ourselves and think about how luck hasn\u2019t been on our side.\u201d\n\nAdam Plutko (7-4) allowed two runs and four hits in six innings his first win since he beat Detroit on Aug. 27. He is 4-0 against the Tigers, including three victories this season.\n\nMercado hit a solo drive off Zac Reininger (0-3) in the second for his 12th homer. Jordan Luplow\u2019s pinch-hit triple in the third drove in two runs, and Roberto P\u00e9rez also had two hits and two RBIs.\n\nMercado, called up from Triple-A Columbus in May, is batting .282 and has brought stability to a team that\u2019s played through adversity.\n\n\u201cEverything just feels good right now,\u201d he said. \u201cMy confidence is pretty high. I\u2019m trying to ride it out as long as I can.\u201d\n\nReininger started in place of Matthew Boyd, who is away from the team for personal reasons. Reininger was charged with four runs in two-plus innings.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping for Reiny to give us three innings, but he got into some trouble in the third, so that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. \u201cIt was kind of survival after that.\u201d\n\nDawel Lugo homered in the fifth for Detroit. V\u00edctor Reyes singled in a run in the third.\n\nOUT\n\nIndians 2N Jason Kipnis will miss the rest of the season with a broken right hand. He is expected to have surgery in the next few days.\n\nAndrew Velazquez, called up from the minors to replace Kipnis, made a long run to catch Lugo\u2019s foul popup in the second. Velazquez hung on to the ball after banging into the stands. Kipnis, wearing a brace on his hand, clapped in the dugout following the play.\n\nVelazquez, recalled from Triple-A Columbus before the game, struck out in all four at-bats, but also started a double play in the seventh. The 25-year-old was acquired from the Rays on July 3.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting to see,\u201d Plutko said. \u201cHe really saved us a couple of times.\u201d\n\nSCRATCHED\n\nFranmil Reyes was scratched as Cleveland\u2019s designated hitter because he\u2019s dealing with a family matter.\n\nIT\u2019S NOT EASY\n\nTigers C Grayson Greiner admitted the losing ways against the Indians and the season in general has been tough.\n\n\u201cIt always stings losing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst feeling in our profession. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re going against.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTigers: 3B Jeimer Candelario (bruised triceps) was scratched, one day after being hit by a pitch.\n\nIndians: LHP Brad Hand is scheduled to throw a bullpen session Wednesday. He hasn\u2019t pitched since Sept. 8 with what the team says is a tired arm.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTigers: RHP Spencer Turnbull (3-15, 4.77 ERA) leads the majors in losses going into Wednesday\u2019s start. The rookie is 0-11 over 15 starts since beating Atlanta on May 31.\n\nIndians: Rookie RHP Aaron Civale (3-3, 1.93 ERA) is 2-0 with a 1.38 ERA in two starts against Detroit.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Indians' dominance of Detroit is reaching a historic level.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Herrick"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/tigers_indians_baseball_96752_c0-111-2651-1656_s1770x1032.jpg?acbcb0e69e3c21c125412ae87991b0a27c725a8e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
