He responded with a thumbs-up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the crowd. Obviously they came to see a full match, and just wasn\u2019t to be,\u201d Djokovic said at his news conference. \u201cI mean, a lot of people didn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, so you cannot blame them.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old Serb explained that he had been \u201ctaking different stuff to kill the pain instantly; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDjokovic had won 36 of his past 37 Grand Slam matches, and four of the last five major titles, in one of the most dominant stretches the sport has seen. That pushed his Slam trophy total to 16, moving within four of Roger Federer\u2019s record 20, and within two of Rafael Nadal\u2019s 18.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s no secret that I have, of course, desire and a goal to reach the most Slams, and reach Roger\u2019s record. But at the same time, it\u2019s a long road ahead hopefully for me. I hope I can play for many more years. I\u2019m planning to. I mean, I don\u2019t see an end behind the corner at all,\u201d said Djokovic, who had been 11-0 in fourth-rounders at Flushing Meadows until this one. \u201cNow it\u2019s a matter of keeping my body and mind in shape and trying to still peak at these kind of events that are majors and that are the most significant in our sport.\u201d\n\nWhen it was over, Wawrinka gave Djokovic a hug.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never the way you want to finish the match,\u201d said the No. 23-seeded Wawrinka, who will face No. 5 Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals. \u201cI feel sorry for Novak.\u201d\n\nDjokovic entered the night with a 19-5 head-to-head edge against Wawrinka across their careers. This, though, was their first meeting since the 2016 U.S. Open final, won by Wawrinka.\n\nAccording to the ATP, this was the 13th mid-match retirement of Djokovic\u2019s career, his sixth at a Grand Slam tournament.\n\nThis outcome scuttles the much-discussed possibility of a semifinal in New York between Djokovic and Federer, which would have been a rematch of their historic Wimbledon final in July. Djokovic won that one in an unprecedented fifth-set tiebreaker after nearly five hours.\n\nThe winner of Wawrinka vs. Medvedev will face the winner of Federer vs. Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals.\n\nDjokovic began complaining about his left shoulder during a second-round victory on Wednesday, when he repeatedly got massaged by a trainer during changeovers.\n\nHe won his next match Friday, looking good and declaring his shoulder much improved, although he refused to disclose any details of the injury or what type of treatment he had received.\n\nWhile Djokovic is a righty, he uses his left arm for the ball tosses on his serves and to grip the racket for his two-fisted backhands.\n\nHis bid for a fourth U.S. Open championship suddenly dissipated Sunday at the conclusion of what for him amounted to a listless and ineffective effort.\n\nAgainst Wawrinka, a three-time major champion himself, Djokovic never quite had the usual verve on his shots or range on his formidable service returns. He was out of sorts on all manner of shots, accumulating 30 unforced errors and only 12 winners through the first two sets.\n\n\u201cFor sure, I could see some little (signs) that he was in trouble,\u201d Wawrinka said.\n\nDjokovic managed to lead 3-0 and 4-1 in the second set, but that was just about all he had in him. Soon he was trying to take shortcuts to avoid lengthy points, and nothing was working.\n\nWhen that set ended, Djokovic had a trainer on for a massage, but soon thereafter, his title defense was over.\n\n\u201cYou just know when you know, I guess,\u201d Djokovic said, \u201cwhen you feel like you\u2019re not able to hit (a) shot anymore.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Novak Djokovic's left shoulder was aching, his chances were fading in the fourth round against Stan Wawrinka and, soon enough, the U.S. Open's defending champion and No. 1 seed was out of the tournament, leaving to a chorus of boos.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/us_open_tennis_67292_c0-168-4003-2501_s1770x1032.jpg?3b4667a35f832e8bf4a5da0a675144abe94a3b37"}
