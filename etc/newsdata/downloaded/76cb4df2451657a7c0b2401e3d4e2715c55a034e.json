Sign up here.\n\nFar-right extremists on the encrypted messaging app Telegram hailed the gunman who killed two people near a synagogue in Halle, Germany, Thursday as a \u201csaint,\u201d a title reserved for white nationalists who\u2019ve carried out previous attacks.\n\nTelegram users pored over the pictures and video footage starting to trickle in for confirmation that the shooter was, indeed, a white male. \u201cI\u2019m betting on a saint here,\u201d one English-language channel wrote to its 1,300 subscribers. Users celebrated the shooting as a sign of the coming \u201cboogaloo\u201d \u2014 a word borrowed from anti-government extremists to refer to an impending civil war.\n\nThe gleeful reaction of white nationalists on Telegram provides yet another example of the international nature of the modern far right, who increasingly rely on Telegram and other unregulated online social marketplaces to build alliances around the world and inspire lone-wolf attacks.\n\nAnd Telegram, specifically, is growing: A recent VICE News analysis of 150 far-right channels found that two-thirds on the platform were created in the first eight months of 2019. The app has provided a safe harbor for extremists who found themselves exiled from mainstream social media and adrift when 8chan was taken offline in June.\n\nThe gunman in Germany targeted a synagogue where around 70 to 80 people had gathered to observe Yom Kippur. He recorded the attack using a camera mounted on his helmet, and the footage was later uploaded to the video game platform Twitch. The video, which Twitch removed, shows him trying to shoot down the door of the synagogue. The door held, so he drove instead to a kebab restaurant where he opened fire and killed two people.\n\nExtremists rely on multimedia, like video clips of previous attacks, images from the battlefield in Ukraine, and PDFs of shooters' manifestos, to inspire future attacks \u2014 and Telegram allows users to upload unlimited amounts of those types of files.\n\nREAD: How teachers are fighting white nationalists brainwashing their students\n\nWhite nationalists on Telegram quickly cloned the shooter\u2019s Twitch video before it was ultimately removed by the company and it on the platform. They also created GIFs of the most violent moments from the video and shared a clip showing the suspect speaking directly to the camera.\n\n\u201cHi, my name is Anon,\u201d he says in the clip, using a name that 4chan and 8chan users often call themselves. \u201cI think the Holocaust never happened.\u201d He also goes on to spout anti-Semitic and white nationalist conspiracy theories, for example blaming feminism for \u201cdeclining birth rates in the West.\u201d The video have also been widely shared on other far-right forums online.\n\nWhile some far-right commentators on places like 4chan mocked the gunman for his \u201clow score\u201d \u2014 which extremists use to talk about the number of people killed in an individual attack \u2014 others defended him. One far-right Telegram channel even used the attack as a teachable moment to remind subscribers about how they should select targets and test security ahead of time.\n\nREAD: Eco-fascism: The racist theory that inspired the El Paso and Christchurch shooters\n\nThe far-right Telegram chatter surrounding the synagogue attack \u2014 such as wondering if the gunman was one of their own \u2014 was reminiscent of the way that ISIS channels parse details of apparent jihadi attacks to decide whether they should claim responsibility. ISIS has long relied on the encrypted app to orchestrate attacks and recruit new members from around the world. The burgeoning far-right and white nationalist Telegram community appear to be taking a page from the ISIS playbook.\n\nThe white nationalist who opened fire on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, live-streamed his attack on Facebook and shared a link to his manifesto on 8chan. The manifesto was full of references to far-right memes and ideas that transcended borders, acting as the glue to an increasingly global far right: The document was named \u201cThe Great Replacement,\u201d which is a popular far-right conspiracy theory and the inspiration for the \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d chant that was heard during the violent Charlottesville rally in August 2017.\n\nLast month, the Soufan Center, a global security research organization, published a report looking at the transnational connections between far-right extremists \u2014 and found that Ukraine had become a \u201chub\u201d for white supremacists. According to the report, at least 17,000 people from 50 countries have traveled to Ukraine since 2014 to fight there, often alongside a neo-Nazi-aligned regiment, and many of those fighters have since returned home with new paramilitary skills.\n\nCover image: Policemen stand with automatic weapons in front of the synagogue.
