There was no possibility of Hansen\u2019s charges in Japan doing likewise and it is odds-on he will be in the winners\u2019 enclosure when the final is played in Yokohama on 2 November.\n\nThere was some breath-taking skill from wing Sevu Reece and full-back Beauden Barrett and some typical physicality from a hard-nosed pack up front as well some handling from their forwards that would put most backs to shame.\n\nIreland managed late tries from Robbie Henshaw and a penalty try but the game was well and truly gone by then.\n\nIt was no way for the warrior and Irish captain Rory Best to leave the international scene on the occasion of his 124th cap but by the time he departed, on 63 minutes, Ireland were 34-0 down.\n\nAll the chat before was how Ireland had to have their A game to beat this New Zealand and they were miles off it but only because the All Blacks did not let them play. This was a team who were rated No.1 in the world ahead of this tournament and they were totally taken to school.\n\nThis was an Irish team who have won Grand Slams, won a Test series in Australia and are chock full of Champions Cup winners and British & Irish Lions.\n\nJohnny Sexton had held court on Friday and said the Kiwis would be in trouble if they tried to rough Ireland up but they did them rough them up \u2013 and it was all legal.\n\nThe Irish fans drowned out the pre-match haka with a rendition of \u2018Fields of Athenry\u2019 and the atmosphere was electric.\n\nTalk about poking the bear.\n\nTwo wins out of three against the world champions counted for nothing as the New Zealanders surged into a 22-0 lead at half-time. And it was not just the tries that the Kiwis scored. In defence they were banging early back in every tackle and not giving them a yard to work with.\n\nIn the opening quarter it was finger in the dyke stuff for the Irish and something had to give. An early Richie Mo\u2019unga penalty was soon supplemented when Kieran Read carried and Smith finished the job off.\n\nOn 20 minutes centre Jack Goodhue fed Reece, who raced cross-field off his flank, and in turn George Bridge went close before Smith again took the honours.\n\nAnd it looked like game, set and match when Barrett scored a try eerily familiar to the one he recorded in the 2015 World Cup final.\n\nReece put a hit on Sexton from which the ball bounced lose and Mo\u2019unga hacked on. Full-back Barrett was on hand to apply another boot before racing clear of the defence and pouncing.\n\nIt was more of the same shortly after the break when hooker Codie Taylor rumbled over and a right old shellacking looked on the cards.\n\nAnd it came with a huge driving maul, a cross kick from Mo\u2019unga to Reece who was held up short only for replacement flanker Matt Todd to go over. Henshaw\u2019s score eventually came before Kiwi substitute hooker Dane Coles made a try for wing George Bridge with ridiculous offload.\n\nIt was all too much for Ireland.", "description": "Steve Hansen\u2019s All Blacks teed up a World Cup semi-final against England next weekend and threw down the gauntlet to Eddie Jones and his side with a demolition of the Irish.
