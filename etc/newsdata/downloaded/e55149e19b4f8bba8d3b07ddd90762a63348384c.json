To me, my spoilers!\n\nShrine\n\nDeadline reports Jeffrey Dean Morgan will star in a film adaptation of James Herbert\u2019s Shrine from director Evan Spiliotopoulos and producers Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert. The story concerns a disgraced journalist investigating a string of reported \u201cmiracles\u201d in a small new England town.\n\nArrow\n\nWilla Holland will reprise her role as Thea Queen for Arrow\u2019s final season as a recurring regular, according to TV Line.\n\nAmerican Horror Story/American Horror Story: 1984\n\nMeanwhile, Jessica Lange revealed to The Wrap she has no plans to return for future seasons of American Horror Story.\n\nI don\u2019t think I would want to start from scratch and create a character. And also I think a lot of the actors that I was working with, people that I really love working with, like Sarah [Paulson] or Frances [Conroy] or Kathy [Bates] \u2014 I don\u2019t know who\u2019s in this new season, but I don\u2019t think it would be the same.\n\nWe also have a \u201cthis season on...\u201d trailer from this week's premiere of American Horror Story: 1984.\n\nThe Archived\n\nVariety reports the CW plans to adapt V.E.
