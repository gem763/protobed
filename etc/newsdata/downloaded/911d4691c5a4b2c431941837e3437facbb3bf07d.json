During last night\u2019s episode, host David Harbour joined cast members Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant as a Peter, Paul and Mary\u2013like folk trio named \u201cPeter, Paula & Murray,\u201d who perform a wonderfully bizarre song about time back in 1962 that just gets more and more absurd. According to the soothing folk group, time ain\u2019t nothing but a bunch of numbers we spend doing things. Some of our favorite numbers from the song: \u201cI\u2019ve spent one, two, three years trying to impress my therapist\u201d; \u201cFour years with a goatee that said I\u2019m a virgin magician\u201d; \u201cThree years changing the diapers of a kid who emancipated from me\u201d; \u201c18 years raising a son who does stand-up about my paintings\u201d; and of course, \u201c12 hours standing on a bridge saying \u2018Do it, you coward.\u2019\u201d There is truly no better celebration of time than this musical masterpiece.\n\nRelated", "description": "On \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 host David Harbour joins cast members Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon as a folk group called Peter, Paula & Murray to sing a hilariously bizarre song about time and numbers.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/12/snl-harbour-mckinnon-bryant-folk.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
