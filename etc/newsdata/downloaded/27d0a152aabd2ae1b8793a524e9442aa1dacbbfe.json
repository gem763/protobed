Global GDP growth is forecast to fall to around 2.5% this year, from 3.2% in 2018, marking the slowest year since the financial crisis of 2008-09.\n\nNorth American M&A is expected to fall to $1.1 trillion in 2020 from $1.5 trillion in 2019. The market has already seen some big-ticket deals taken off the table. In September, Philip Morris International PM, +0.10% and Altria MO, +0.35% abandoned their merger plans to create the world\u2019s biggest tobacco company with combined sales of $200 billion after a lukewarm reception from investors.\n\n\u201cInvestors are becoming concerned about high valuations and rising corporate leverage, and we\u2019ve seen the market respond less-than-favourably to a number of large deal announcements recently,\u201d said Michael DeFranco, global chair of Baker McKenzie\u2019s M&A practice.\n\nEurope will also see a decline in M&A linked to the U.K.\u2019s potential exit from the European Union and a slowing German economy drags down the volume of deals to $427 billion in 2020 from $567 billion last year.\n\n\u201cThere is notable decreased appetite for acquisition, and to make matters worse, European governments have increased regulatory scrutiny significantly in 2019,\u201d the report noted.\n\nThe EU\u2019s antitrust enforcer blocked the planned merger of the European steel businesses of India\u2019s Tata Steel and Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp TKA, +0.12% in June, saying the combination would reduce competition in the supply of special steel for the car and packaging industries. Four months earlier, it nixed the merger between the German and French train manufacturers Siemens SIE, -0.18% and Alstom ALO, -1.62% despite intense Franco-German lobbying.\n\nThe outlook isn\u2019t gloomy for all investors, however. The volatile global market will be a boon for private equity as they deploy the record amount of capital they have amassed to pick up bargains. Private market funds globally have a $2.1tn cash pile to spend, according to data provider Preqin.\n\nThe global market for initial public offerings will continue to be sluggish. Proceeds from IPOs are forecast to drop by 23%, from an estimated $152 billion in 2019 to $116 billion in 2020.", "description": "Escalating trade tensions and the upcoming U.S. presidential election will add uncertainty to deal volumes which are set to fall by 25% in 2020.", "authors": ["Lina Saigol"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT292_philip_ZG_20191015072012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
