(Theresa) May held an election to resolve Brexit,' they said.\n\n'Tory moderates don\u2019t want a winter general election from what we can tell.'\n\nMPs said a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party recently had been 'unanimous' in saying there should be a referendum before an election.\n\nWhat happens next in the Brexit crisis? Here is how the coming weeks could pan out: Today: Boris Johnson holds talks with Leo Varadkar. Tomorrow: EU's deadline for having a deal in place ready for next week's summit. October 14: Parliament is due to return for the Queen's Speech. October 17-18: A crunch EU summit in Brussels, but Mr Johnson now seems certain to boycott the event in protest at the bloc's intransigence. October 19: If there is no Brexit deal by this date Remainer legislation obliges the PM to beg the EU for an extension to avoid No Deal. Jeremy Corbyn has said that he will only let Mr Johnson trigger an election after an extension has been secured. If there is a deal, it will start being rushed through Parliament immediately. October 31: The current deadline for the UK to leave the EU. November/December: An election looks inevitable.\n\nOne senior backbencher told MailOnline they believed Mr Corbyn would retreat in the face of massive internal opposition, including from shadow cabinet figures such as Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer.\n\n'The idea of a confirmatory ballot is gathering support. As a matter of principle it should be sort Brexit first, general election second,' the MP said.\n\nAnother Remain-backing MP said they believed the 22 former Tories will be the key to whether there is a shift towards a second referendum.\n\nThe MP, who has spoken to a number of the former Tory rebels, believes they are moving towards backing a referendum at least in part because they have no incentive to back a general election.\n\nIf most of those 21 MPs were to back a referendum the thinking is that could then prompt Jeremy Corbyn to shift Labour\u2019s position.\n\nThe MP told MailOnline: \u2018If you add them to the rest of us there is a little gap in the clouds for the plane to fly through.\n\n\u2018They wanted a deal, they don\u2019t particularly want to Remain, but they definitely fear and hate No Deal.\u2019\n\nOn how MPs could force a vote on holding a second referendum, the MP said: \u2018If the government table any motion at all they are all amendable. Now we are in a period where MPs are not just reactive but proactive so there are all sorts of opportunities.\u2019\n\nTory outcasts such as ex-Cabinet minister Oliver Letwin have called for a referendum to be held first.\n\nFormer chancellor Philip Hammond added his weight to the argument this morning, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I don't think an election solves our problem here. I would not support an election at the moment.\n\n'Ironically, a few weeks ago we were being asked to give assurances that we wouldn't vote against the Government in a vote of no confidence and now we're being asked to vote to turn the Government out.'\n\nHe said a confirmatory referendum 'is not my preferred option', but did not rule one out.\n\nBut a shadow cabinet minister, not normally a Corbyn loyalist, told MailOnline that those pushing for a second referendum were engaging in 'wishful thinking' and their plans were 'fanciful'.\n\n'The facts on the ground in the end are we have a country with no government,' they said. 'You can share their concerns, but there never has been a majority for a second referendum in the House of Commons. The maths on that has not changed for 12 months.'\n\nThey added: 'I can understand the wishful thinking, but we are in a mess, there has got to be a very clear route through this.\n\n'Our Parliament and our politics is paralysed at the most critical time when really big decisions are required, never mind about Brexit but on other fronts from a faltering economy to a flare-up in the Middle East with Turkey and Syria.\n\nMr Corbyn's plans for the country In his speech in Northampton today, Mr Corbyn set out plans to: 'Immediately legislate' to hold a second referendum if the party wins the next election\n\nScrap the current \u00a39,000-per-year university tuition fees\n\nBring England in to line with Scotland, Wales an Northern Ireland by making medical prescriptions free\n\nEnd the controversial Universal Credit system of benefits\n\nBuild one million 'affordable homes' over the next 10 years\n\nIntroduce extra funding for local authorities whi have experienced cuts in recent years\n\nTake a 51 per cent public stake in wind farms to help coastal communities and tackle climate change\n\nRaise the minimum wage rise to \u00a310 an hour for all workers aged 16 and over\n\n'There is a lot of really big business as usual that the government is unable to cope with.'\n\nIn his speech in Northamptonshire today, Mr Corbyn again set out his plan for Labour to get into power, renegotiate a deal with the EU, and then hold a referendum between that package and Remain.\n\nHowever, extraordinarily, he suggested he will not campaign for either side in the national vote.\n\n'Within three months of coming to power, a Labour government will secure a sensible deal, based on the terms we have long advocated and discussed with the EU, trade unions and businesses, including a new customs union, a close single market relationship and guarantees of rights and protections,' he said.\n\n'Within six months of being elected we will put that deal to a public vote alongside remain.\n\n'And as prime minister I will carry out whatever the people decide.'\n\nMr Corbyn said the Queen's Speech on Monday would be a 'farce'.\n\n'This Government isn't going to put any legislation before Parliament,' he said.\n\n'It has a majority of minus 45, a 100 per cent record of defeat in the Commons and is seeking a general election which will end the parliamentary session the Queen is about to open.\n\n'Holding a Queen's Speech before an election is a cynical stunt.\n\n'Johnson is using the Queen to deliver a pre-election party political broadcast for the Conservative Party.'\n\nThe Labour leader insisted the issue of a no-deal Brexit had to be sorted out before a general election because Mr Johnson could not be trusted.\n\nMr Corbyn said: 'Prime Minister, we can't trust you not to break the law because you've got form.\n\n'We can't trust you not to use the period of an election campaign to drive our country off a no-deal cliff edge that will crash our economy, destroy jobs and industries, cause shortages of medicine and food and endanger peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Labour leader is set to say that the country could not trust Boris Johnson 'not to break the law'. Pictured: PM in Downing Street today\n\n'So it's simple: obey the law, take No Deal off the table and then let's have the election.\n\n'We're ready and champing at the bit.\n\n'There's only one reason it hasn't happened yet - we can't trust you.'\n\nMr Corbyn will lay out his alternative Queen's Speech, calling it 'the most radical of modern times'.\n\nIt would include a 'final say Brexit referendum', a \u00a310-an-hour minimum wage, banning fracking, scrapping tuition fees, ending rough sleeping and free personal care and prescriptions.\n\nMr Corbyn's speech is also set to say: 'We might be just weeks away from the first Queen's Speech of a Labour government.\n\n'And in that Queen's Speech, Labour will put forward the most radical, hopeful, people-focused programme in modern times: a once-in-a-generation chance to rebuild and transform our country.'\n\nMr Johnson was accused of dragging the Queen into politics over his bid to suspend Parliament.\n\nThe Prime Minister was heavily criticised after a Supreme Court ruling last month found there was no 'reasonable justification' for his advice to the monarch to prorogue Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to the State Opening.", "description": "Remainers are preparing an all-out bid to force a referendum to cancel Brexit first, with Labour backbenchers warning that Mr Corbyn is a 'liability' and an election will not resolve the issue.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent", "James Tapsfield", "Political Editor", "Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19533710-0-image-a-19_1570703083344.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
