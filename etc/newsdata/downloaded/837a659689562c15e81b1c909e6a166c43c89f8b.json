Jars of powdered dyes were stacked atop a table next to a digital scale and a hot plate. The top of the workbench was stained in blue hues \u2014 azure, cerulean, indigo \u2014 and an open composition book was inked with test swatches and recipes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI spend all day working in a clean room,\u201d Thompson said. The 27-year-old works at a pharmaceutical company in Gaithersburg, donning protective coveralls and pulling hairnets over his long red locks and beard. In the shed, Thompson can literally let his hair down.\n\nFountain pens are in the midst of a revival, embraced by those who seek a canvas more interesting than the blank face of a smartphone. You can spend a lot on a fancy fountain pen \u2014 from hundreds to thousands of dollars. A small-batch ink costs a lot less. Retailers sell Thompson\u2019s 55 milliliter bottles for $13 a piece.\n\nThe handwriting is on the wall: Fountain pens are back.\n\nThompson caught the fountain pen bug in high school, when his grandmother gave him an old Sheaffer Snorkel, a writing instrument that in the 1950s revolutionized the pen world. You fill it by extending a tube that emerges from under the nib like the proboscis of a mosquito and dipping it in the ink bottle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Thompson was an undergrad studying chemistry at the University of Maryland, he got a job at Bertram\u2019s Inkwell, a fountain pen shop then in White Flint Mall. He learned about the explosion of limited-production inks that come in delightful colors or have interesting properties. Owner Bert Oser encouraged Thompson to make his own.\n\n\u201cBert, knowing my background was in chemistry, said, \u2018Hey you could make these inks.\u2019 He was the one who pushed me to first think about it.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2012. Thompson pored over old scientific journal articles about ink. At the time, he was living in a dorm at the University of Maryland College Park. He would wait for students to go to bed, then walk down the hall to the communal bathroom and experiment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe next morning the sink would be stained blue and red, and they\u2019d be wondering who did it,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt was super small-scale, like in Mason jars more or less.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter college, his mom\u2019s kitchen in Knoxville, Md., near Harpers Ferry became the cook shop.\n\n\u201cShe supported the ink thing, but it was messy, as you can imagine.\u201d\n\nNow Thompson and his wife, Tessa, have their own place. He can experiment in the shed. Tessa pitches in. So does Thompson\u2019s sister Brianna. His friend Sean Gallup goes with him to fountain pen shows, where Organics Studio displays its wares.\n\nThompson is especially celebrated for making inks that have a unique sheen: They go on looking one color, but from different angles appear a different hue. Some look blue in the bottle then shade to red on the paper, the result of dyes that are extremely soluble, able to be added in volume to the water. Rather than sinking into the paper, the dye crystallizes on its surface, reflecting the light in captivating ways.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOrganics Studio\u201d is a play on Thompson\u2019s field of study: organic chemistry. He started out naming his homemade ink after elements on the periodic table before realizing a lot of elements have boring names. Now Thompson\u2019s inks are named after famous authors, including Emily Dickinson (violet), Aldous Huxley (turquoise), James Joyce (green) and Henry David Thoreau (blue, with a red sheen).\n\n\u201cPeople who are into these things are passionate, artistic,\u201d Thompson said of his customers. \u201cThey enjoy the novelty of discovery.\u201d\n\nSo does he. While ink may not run in Thompson\u2019s veins, it is on his skin. Tattooed atop his right pointer finger is a fountain pen nib.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "Organics Studio produces colorful, limited-edition inks for the fountain pen revival.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5N2mG512LWDFZEuaShJI72HDWts=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJQH73HDSQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
