As the news broke on 28 August that Boris was going to prorogue Parliament, I felt muscles I didn\u2019t even know I had contract with anxiety. Watching the subsequent row unfold in the news and on social media, I hunched over my laptop for much too long and when I finally stood up, wham. I was struck double by the \u201cHexenschuss\u201d, the witch\u2019s shot, as the Germans call it.\n\nKnowing that if I sat back down, I\u2019d never get up again, I leaned heavily against the kitchen counter to call my friend and fellow author Michael Maisey, who was due to tell me all about his experiences with the Wim Hof Method. Michael, who spent most of his teenage years in Feltham Young Offenders Institute, becoming a heroin addict and alcoholic along the way, is almost 12 years sober. The Wim Hof Method is part of the arsenal of wellness techniques he uses to stay that way.\n\nWim Hof, also known as The Iceman, is a Dutch athlete. His nickname is apt, if unoriginal. He\u2019s set records for sitting in ice and for swimming underneath it. In 2000, he swam 57.5 metres, setting a Guinness World Record. He still holds the world record for a barefoot half-marathon on snow. He once climbed to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro wearing only shorts. He claims that his feats of icy endurance are down to his eponymous Method, which combines breathing techniques and meditation with frequent exposure to the cold. His website is full of video clips of happy people sitting in giant ice buckets.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWatching Hof on YouTube, it\u2019s hard to take him seriously. He\u2019s like a spoof of a hippy with his long beard and straggly grey hair and there\u2019s always the hint of suppressed laughter in his Austin Powers \u201csmoke and a pancake\u201d accent. His patent breathing technique looks to me at first glance like the hyperventilating my school friends and I would practice in an attempt to fake a faint before a French test.\n\n\n\nAs for the ice-bath stuff? The word that sprang to mind on that front was \u201cnutter\u201d even though just the previous evening, on a stifling 30-degree night in London, I would have paid a tenner to stick my feet in.\n\nThe claims Hof makes for his method are extraordinary. It isn\u2019t only for improving your performance at insane sports. It can help improve the way you sleep. It can reduce stress. It can boost your immune system. In one testimonial, Matt, a Hof devotee from Devon, claims that the Method cured his Lichen Planopilaris \u2013 an autoimmune disease that affects the skin \u2013 enabling him to stop taking the prescription drugs that had left him racked with charming side-effects such as coughing up blood. Matt also credits WHM with helping him to maintain his mental health.\n\nMy friend Michael recognises Matt\u2019s experience. He came across WHM via a documentary he found on line. Like me, Michael\u2019s first thought was that Wim Hof must be a freak of nature but, no stranger to physical challenge himself, he decided to give the breathing technique a punt anyway. He first tried to teach himself by watching YouTube videos. Later, he attended a course taught by Wim Hof himself, where he took the dreaded ice bath. Since then, Michael has been practising the breathing technique and taking cold showers almost every day for two years and says that he hasn\u2019t been ill in all that time. He also credits WHM with helping him to stay calm and focussed when, just as he was launching his first book, Young Offender, he learned that his father had died. \u201cIt\u2019s like an anti-depressant for me,\u201d he says of the breathing technique in particular.\n\nNow Michael introduces others to the Method \u2013 including the ice bath \u2013 at the Devon-based men\u2019s retreats he runs several times a year. Just hearing about it made me want to hyperventilate. The combination of holding one\u2019s breath and jumping into freezing water could never seem like anything more than torture to me.\n\nYet, Michael persuaded me to give the breathing technique a go. He explained how it works. Put simply, you build up the concentration of oxygen in your blood by breathing in deeply \u2013 \u201cto 100% capacity\u201d \u2013 then letting the breath out \u2013 \u201cbut not all the way\u201d \u2013 30 or 40 times before you breathe out and then pause in breathing for as long as feels comfortable. Then you breathe in naturally and hold that in breath for 10 seconds before starting the whole sequence again.\n\nIt sounded\u2026 confusing. I decided to let Hof guide me through the sequence himself. Michael sent me the link to Hof\u2019s introductory video. I joined Hof, virtually, cross-legged on the floor \u2013 getting cross-legged took some doing \u2013 and began. Belly, chest, head. We breathe with all of them apparently. I couldn\u2019t seem to get my breath above my neck or below my belt. My back was screaming for attention. About three minutes into the video, Hof mentioned that the breathing exercise is best done on an empty stomach. I\u2019d just had some toast and a bucket of tea. No wonder I felt weird. I gave up.\n\nLater in the afternoon, I tried again. It was sort of by accident. I\u2019d gone upstairs to find a book. I was still locked into a 90-degree angle by the Hexenschuss. I sat down on the floor. Then I lay down, hoping for some relief from the pain. I pulled out my phone and scrolled to the video link Michael had sent me. Wim Hof\u2019s voice, with its hint of chuckle, started up. I decided I\u2019d give it one more go.\n\n\u201cFully in. Letting go. Not fully out but fully in\u2026\u201d\n\nI breathed along with the master 30 times. After the first round, I held my breath for one minute. At the end of the second round, I managed one minute, 10 seconds. At the end of the third round, I was astonished to see that I\u2019d managed a minute and a half. But it wasn\u2019t just that I\u2019d been able to improve my breath-holding by 50 per cent in the space of 10 minutes, I was certain I could feel a difference in my body. I definitely felt a tingling sensation down the back of my legs. I wasn\u2019t sure whether it was a good thing.\n\nTentatively, I began to sit up, bending my knees and holding on to the back of my thighs as I rolled my upper body from the floor. Prior to the exercise, I\u2019d been unable to get up from a prone position without first rolling on to my side. Now I could sit straight up. I tried a couple of full Pilates-style roll ups for good measure. I stood up. I leaned forward to touch my toes and didn\u2019t get stuck there. I couldn\u2019t believe it. My back was fine. Was it all thanks to the Hof?\n\nWim Hof\u2019s Method has been put to the test by people far more rigorous than me. Over the years Hof\u2019s made some big claims about reducing the symptoms of MS and Parkinson\u2019s Disease and even curing cancer that certainly require close scrutiny. However, journalist Scott Carney, who set out to debunk Hof\u2019s theories in his book What Doesn\u2019t Kill Us, ended up becoming a devotee himself. And in 2011, the University Medical Centre St Radboud in Nijmegen ran an experiment, the results of which were published in Nature, which appeared to show that Hof and his followers were able to harness the breath to voluntarily influence the autonomic nervous system.\n\nAs I write this, I am still astonished by the effect Wim Hof\u2019s breathing technique seems to have had on my back. When I felt it go, I was expecting the usual: days of increasing pain followed by an expensive visit to the physio. To lie down on the floor in agony and get up again after 10 minutes of heavy breathing, feeling ready if not to run a marathon over ice then at least to walk to the supermarket without wincing, felt like a blinking miracle. I\u2019m too flabbergasted to think of anything more to say other than \u201ctry it\u201d. Whatever\u2019s going on, maybe taking a deep breath and holding it Wim Hof-style could make you feel better. For now though, his ice bath can wait.", "description": "Brexit did my back in.
