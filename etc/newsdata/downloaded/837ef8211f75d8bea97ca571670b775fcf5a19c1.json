Gavin Newsom on Saturday.\n\nIn a press release Saturday, the Democrat governor stated, \u201cCreating a \u2018California for All\u2019 means ensuring schools are inclusive, accepting, and welcoming of all kids. These bills help move us closer to that goal.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued:\n\nEarlier this year, Napa County elementary school student Ryan Kyote called national attention to how kids at his school were shamed and singled out because of inadequate funds in their school lunch accounts. He showed how at many schools across the country, students whose parents are not able to pay for their lunch are given a cheaper, \u2018alternative\u2019 lunch that causes them to stick out from their peers.\n\n\u201cSB 265 by Senator Robert Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys) outlaws that practice, ensuring all students receive a state reimbursable meal of their choice, even if their parent or guardian has unpaid meal fees,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nReports said Kyote paid off his class\u2019s lunch debt with the $74.80 he had saved in his allowance.\n\nNewsom met with the third grader earlier this year to discuss the problem. \u201cI want to thank Ryan for his empathy and his courage in bringing awareness to this important issue,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe new law prohibits California\u2019s K-12 public schools from giving students a cheaper alternative meal if they cannot afford to buy lunch.\n\nOn Sunday, Newsom announced the new legislation on Twitter and stated that \u201cLunch shaming is very real\u201d:\n\nWhen parents can't afford to buy their kids the typical school lunch, students are sometimes denied food or given a different, cheaper alternative. Lunch shaming is very real and has serious consequences for the well-being of our kids. No more in CA. https://t.co/MBL9BOICal \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) October 13, 2019\n\nIn June of 2017, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill into law that sought to address the same issue.\n\nReports said Senate Bill 1566 included an amendment that allowed students a grace period so they could continue to eat lunch at school, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nRep. Helen Giddings (D-Desoto) said the measure would prevent kids from \u201chaving their lunch snatched away and thrown in the trash and going hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted that we are were able to get that legislation through,\u201d she commented. \u201cIt is a major victory for children of the state of Texas.\u201d", "description": "School \"lunch shaming\" is now against the law in California, according to a bill signed by Gov.
