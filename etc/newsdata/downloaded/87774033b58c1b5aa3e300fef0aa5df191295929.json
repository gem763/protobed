Ever since Killing Eve\u2019s fabulously-clad villain, played by Jodie Comer, graced the small screen in May 2018 in a sugar pink trapeze dress designed by Goddard, the brand has felt inseparable from the BBC3 drama.\n\nLast season the designer embraced the assassin\u2019s influence full throttle, showing 100 yards of magenta in a gown that has since been Instagrammed ad infinitum. This season, it was clear that Goddard was seeking to rid herself of her Killing Eve shackles.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Here, tulle played a more decorative role: wrapped around hips like college sweatshirts and loosely layered over contrasting slips.\n\nThe colour palette was fresh \u2013 of lime greens, whites, pinks and reds \u2013 with some dark florals thrown in (obligatory for spring) and shots of electric blue. Light and airy crop tops in crisp cotton revealed the designer\u2019s expertise in manipulating fabric to create volume without structural support.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Models wore greased back hair and black lipstick to offset the girlishness and inject that cool-girl punk attitude.\n\nDenim, too, made an appearance this season. Heavy indigo shades were manipulated like thick silk, cut to flounce in skirts and puff out and blouson in sleeves. A jacket with corset-style peplum and blazer lapels harked back to last season\u2019s epaulettes with loosely bunched sleeves. \u201cOne thing I love is that we made toiles for everything that wasn\u2019t tulle and I always love calico more than anything else,\u201d the designer told The Independent. \u201cDenim is a very similar structure to calico \u2013 in volume and in that it cuts well frayed and shows construction and cross stitching.\u201d The remarkable amount of craftsmanship involved in these designs cannot be underestimated.\n\nNever one to swallow femininity whole, Goddard had her models carry silver-studded leather handbags \u2013 a new addition to her oeuvre \u2013 and wear cobalt bright blue and pillar-box red flat boots. Cable-knit jumpers with cut-out shoulders tied with ribbons, also provided shoppers with a more accessible way into the brand.\n\n\u201cA lot of this was looking back at some of the things I had done in the last five years that I liked most and redoing them and doing them more and more and bigger and better\u201d.
