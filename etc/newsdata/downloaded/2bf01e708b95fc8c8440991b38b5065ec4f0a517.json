Whitby/Getty Images)\n\nJamie Vardy has been \u2018distressed\u2019 amidst his wife Rebekah\u2019s very public spat with Coleen Rooney.\n\nIn the showbiz scandal that has taken over social media, Coleen, 33, has accused Rebekah, 37, of leaking fake stories about her to the press after falling prey to Coleen\u2019s Instagram trap.\n\nAnd Rebekah has said her footballer husband has been just as upset as her.\n\nSpeaking to the Mail, Rebekah, who married Jamie in 2016, said: \u2018He\u2019s been very distressed to see me so upset.\u2019\n\nRebekah, who is seven months pregnant with her fifth child, was still in Dubai with Jamie, 32, when she did the interview, although it\u2019s believed she has now cut their holiday short.\n\nIt\u2019s the showbiz clash of the year (Picture: Getty/ITV/Rex)\n\nThe I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here! star tweeted just yesterday that she would not be speaking on the subject \u2018until we\u2019ve finished looking into this situation properly\u2019 \u2013 but in her interview, she shared her shock at Coleen going so public with her allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mum-of-four said: \u2018We have always got on and that is what makes it all the more difficult. For instance, I messaged her when Wayne was in trouble over the drink-driving. I have been a supportive friend.\n\n\u2018She sent me a gift when my youngest Finlay was born and I sent her a present when her baby Cass arrived. There was never any hint of any bad blood between us or any hint that she had a suspicion about me.\u2019\n\nRebekah doubled down on her denial, saying that \u2018quite a few people\u2019, including a PR agency and an advertising agency, have had access to her Instagram account over the years.\n\nRebekah has denied the allegations (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nColeen shared a statement on Wednesday reading: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nRebekah fired back in her own statement, writing: \u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
