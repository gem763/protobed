Several investors said they liked the company but asked why should they take the regulatory risk and they are not close enough to Australia to assess it.\"\n\nLatitude's prospectus drew attention to the regulation risks, including pointing out that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is investigating its processes and practices relating to vulnerable customers, leading to remediation of around $1.55 million relating to one matter.\n\nPE scrutiny\n\nAs fallout from failure of what would have been the year's biggest float continued to reverberate on Thursday, fund managers said they will be closely scrutinising new deals involving private equity vendors. These include KKR's online real estate classifieds group, PropertyGuru, and Bain Capital's Retail Zoo, which owns Boost Juice.\n\nVeteran fund manager Geoff Wilson said future private equity floats will be judged on price. \"There will always be demand for a well-priced float, whether the seller is private equity or not,\" he said.\n\n\"Unfortunately. the pricing of Latitude wasn't attractive enough to generate the required demand.\"\n\nThe Latitude flop joins a long line of high-profile failed PE deals, including Myer in 2009, which has never traded above its issue price, chicken giant Inghams Group in 2016 and retailer Dick Smith, which floated in 2013 only to collapse in 2016. Estia Health, 3P Learning, Spotless and Orion Health also disappointed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the Latitude demise, PE industry leaders are seeking to reassure potential investors that PE-sponsored deals can still deliver returns. Yasser El-Ansary, chief executive of the Australian Investment Council, which represents the PE industry, pointed to data compiled by Rothschild which shows the average returns for PE-backed IPOs between 2013 and 2017 are 24.3 per cent, higher than the 16.8 per cent for non-PE-backed companies over the same period.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, there has been a persistent view investors should be sceptical about IPOs coming out of PE vendors, but the reality is \u2013 borne out by facts and data \u2013 that is not the case. It\u2019s a broad sweeping generalisation that no longer holds true,\" Mr El-Ansary said.\n\n\"The reality is PE-backed deals have delivered consistently well for many years now, not just here in Australia but all around the world.\n\n\u201cThose arguments can provide a convenient excuse for not participating in an IPO, or are used by those that have missed out as a diversion strategy with an ulterior purpose. On the whole, PE-backed businesses are much stronger and are better governed, and more strategically focused towards the medium- and long-term growth than perhaps other floats might be.\u201d\n\nSources close to the Latitude deal say it's too early to say what the future holds for its three shareholders, but it will be difficult to bring it back to the public market in the next few years.\n\nThis will put pressure on them to find another way to create liquidity to exit their investments, which could involve selling it to another PE firm, or another lender.\n\nOne adviser said it would be unlikely Latitude will be carved up and sold in bits because it operates using one technology system and unified sales teams, meaning the value of the business in its parts would be less than the value of the whole.", "description": "The failed Latitude Financial float has revealed fallout from the Hayne royal commission has gone global, after sources close to the deal said US and Asian investors fretted that emboldened Australian regulators could further clamp down on lending obligations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/224a49b905a4e5375cffca239903b026d8eda267", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
