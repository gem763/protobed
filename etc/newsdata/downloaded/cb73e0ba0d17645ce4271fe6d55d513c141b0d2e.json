He did not appear before reporters.\n\nToyoda said Uchida was chosen unanimously by the board because of his wide international experience. He is seen as able to lead Nissan\u2019s longtime alliance with French automaker Renault. Renault owns 43% of Nissan.\n\nThe Yokohama-based company also named Ashwani Gupta, chief operating officer at its alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp. to be its new COO.\n\nThe board members pointed out Gupta\u2019s Indian nationality added to the international expertise of the leadership. Gupta is a member of the Renault management committee.\n\nGhosn is awaiting trial in Japan on charges of falsifying documents on deferred compensation and of breach of trust in allegedly diverting Nissan money for personal gain. He denies wrongdoing.\n\nSaikawa had been closely allied with the Brazilian-born Frenchman but turned against him.\n\nHe resigned last month after an internal investigation found he had received inappropriate extra compensation. The income, linked to Nissan\u2019s stock price, got inflated after the date for cashing in was illicitly adjusted. Saikawa said he had been unaware of the adjustment.\n\nNissan had promised to announce his replacement within a month.\n\nThe appointments need shareholders\u2019 approval, which the board members said would be sought early next year.\n\nGhosn led Nissan for two decades and made it one of the most successful automakers in the world before his arrest in November 2018.\n\nHe has been charged with falsifying documents on deferred compensation which he had not received. He has also been charged with breach of trust for allegedly funneling company money for personal gain.\n\nA Nissan investigation has cited the use of company jets by Ghosn\u2019s family, use of company money for family vacations and personal gifts and donations to universities as examples of his alleged misconduct.\n\nGhosn\u2019s trial is not expected to start until next year. Saikawa has not been charged with any wrongdoing.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nissan tapped the head of its China business, Makoto Uchida, as its new president and chief executive, replacing Hiroto Saikawa, who resigned after acknowledging receiving dubious income.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Yuri Kageyama"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/japan_nissan_44259_c0-100-2401-1499_s1770x1032.jpg?60b7dff92ddb85eab5b3006e5eb0657569f99e33", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
