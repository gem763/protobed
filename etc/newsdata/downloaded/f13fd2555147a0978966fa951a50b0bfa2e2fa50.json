But others doubt the tactics are intentional and note that it has strained the Democratic caucus, aroused suspicion among the party\u2019s base and could potentially weaken the House\u2019s hand in court.\n\nSixteen House Democrats, in interviews, offered wildly conflicting assessments of the status of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation of Trump, which its chairman \u2014 Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) \u2014 bills as an \u201cimpeachment investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been in the midst of an impeachment investigation,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not in an impeachment investigation,\u201d said a second lawmaker, Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nA third, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) said the House is investigating to determine \u201cwhether or not there should be an impeachment investigation.\u201d\n\nOthers are wrangling over semantics, with some insisting the House is in an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d while others are hewing to the \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d terminology, which the Judiciary Committee introduced in court filings in late July. Others, like Nadler, say they\u2019re synonymous.\n\n\u201cYou know I think people can call it whatever they want to call it but I think we\u2019re just trying to get to the truth and we\u2019ll see where that leads us,\u201d said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), who leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\n\u201cGo to the dictionary and try to determine the difference between an inquiry and an investigation,\u201d Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), who supports impeachment, said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you which of those is more significant,\u201d Sherman added. \u201cAnd I realize the politics of it. I realize how they\u2019re using the language. But somebody just focusing on the dictionary couldn\u2019t tell you which is more important.\u201d\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See which House lawmakers support impeachment.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, some lawmakers called Nadler over the August recess in order to \u201cget a better understanding of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi avoids the terms altogether. In a talking-point document to colleagues Tuesday morning, Pelosi\u2019s office described the House\u2019s investigative activity in anodyne terms, characterizing them as typical House oversight of the executive branch. The talking points characterized a Thursday vote by the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 billed by the panel as a formal acknowledgment of the House\u2019s impeachment probe \u2014 as \u201cprocedures related to its investigation of the president\u2019s wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nPelosi has at times adopted the harsh rhetoric of pro-impeachment lawmakers, most recently accusing Trump of violating the Constitution by allegedly steering government spending to his luxury resorts. She has also accused Trump of \u201cself-impeaching\u201d and privately told colleagues she preferred to see him in prison, rather than impeached. But Pelosi has also repeatedly emphasized the House\u2019s slow, deliberative investigative and legal strategy when pressed on impeachment.\n\nSome Democrats dismiss the semantic and tactical fight as an inconsequential media obsession or insist that there are no conflicting sentiments. Others view it as a sign of the disjointed strategy and messaging as the House enters a crucial phase of its Trump-focused investigations. In the meantime, top Democrats are working to smooth over and downplay any differences between them.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is very clear. It\u2019s been very clear. It continues to be very clear,\u201d Nadler told reporters on Monday. He added: \u201cThe speaker has backed us at every point along the way.\u201d\n\nPrivately, though, some Democrats are fretting that the mixed messages could hurt them in federal court, where they are fighting multiple battles with the president and the Justice Department over access to former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s files and key witnesses. The committee\u2019s court filings are dependent on judges accepting the House\u2019s posture on pursuing potential impeachment of the president.\n\nThe competing characterizations have seeped into staff meetings, including a gathering of communications directors for members of the Judiciary Committee who complained that they lacked clarity to prepare their boss\u2019 for media appearances related to impeachment, according to two people present for the meeting.\n\nSeveral staffers argued in the Monday afternoon meeting, which at times became heated, that they were not fully briefed on the broader strategy \u2014 to which Judiciary Committee staffers responded that those details would need to come from top Democrats\u2019 offices, rather than their own panel.\n\nSince returning from the six-week August recess, Pelosi has publicly and privately sought to limit talk of impeachment in favor of discussing the caucus\u2019s policy aims, like new gun limits.\n\nIn a Democratic Caucus meeting on Tuesday morning \u2014 their first in-person gathering since the end of July \u2014 the topic was briefly mentioned, according to people in the room. Pelosi said the Judiciary Committee\u2019s process is \u201ckeeping open the options for all of us,\u201d according to a source who was inside the room.\n\nThe set of talking points distributed by the speaker\u2019s office on Tuesday and obtained by POLITICO does not mention impeachment; instead, the document, which was prepared in conjunction with the Judiciary Committee, referenced federal court opinions stating that the House has an absolute right to investigate.\n\nBut those cases have yet to yield new information, and even the ones that the House has won are tied up in the appeals process.\n\nHimes, a moderate Democrat who publicly favors an impeachment inquiry, acknowledged that Pelosi and her leadership team have sought to craft a message that can work for all corners of her caucus.\n\n\u201cI represent the people of southwestern Connecticut. The speaker sees the whole country, so I\u2019m giving her a lot of room,\u201d Himes said. \u201cThe speaker understands that impeachment is a political thing, that\u2019s why it lives in the Congress. And I\u2019ve known the speaker long enough that politics for her means public sentiment.\u201d\n\nBut some Democrats also acknowledge that it could look like the caucus is attempting to have it both ways on impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt gives people cover to be able to say, we\u2019re not for impeachment, we\u2019re just investigating,\u201d Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.), a vocal supporter of ousting Trump. \u201cBut it does formalize it more, it depends on what exactly they do not.\u201d\n\nTo Nadler, the answer is \u201cclear\u201d: his committee is investigating the possibility of recommending articles of impeachment \u2014 holding hearings and fighting court battles for evidence to make its determination. Last month, he said: \u201cThis is formal impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nNearly two months ago, the Judiciary Committee began telling federal courts that impeachment is a possible outcome of their myriad investigations. The panel began embracing the term as a way to obtain information and testimony related to former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, in particular the allegations that Trump obstructed justice.\n\nNadler and his fellow Democrats on the committee began using the term \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d as a shorthand for their process of determining whether to recommend articles of impeachment \u2014 even as more and more House Democrats came out in favor of a formal impeachment inquiry, which is triggered by a full House vote.\n\nBy resisting a formal inquiry but signing off on the Judiciary Committee\u2019s impeachment investigation, Pelosi satiated progressives\u2019 demands for a more aggressive posture, which protects her more vulnerable members from a politically treacherous vote to establish a formal inquiry.\n\nAsked if it seemed to be part of a grand strategy, Vargas laughed and said: \u201cNo, I wish we did have one.\u201d", "description": "House Democrats are frustrated over the mixed messages on impeachment.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio", "Sarah Ferris", "Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/08/7d/57eeff444c3485fefb424c118b38/190910jerry-nadler-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
