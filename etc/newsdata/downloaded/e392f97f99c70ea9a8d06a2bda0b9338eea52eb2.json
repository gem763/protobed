Adam Russell Taylor, executive director of the Christian organization Sojourners, told HuffPost. \u201cThe deflection, lies, and conspiracy theories promulgated by the Administration and the President\u2019s most loyal Congressional allies represent an assault on truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis perilous moment calls for bold action from both religious and civic leaders who must put country and the common good over partisanship, the pursuit of truth over lies, and morality and accountability over fear and short-term political calculation,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is looking into allegations, backed up by Trump\u2019s own words, that the president sought political favors from Ukraine to help his 2020 reelection campaign. Trump has called the congressional investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and the White House announced Tuesday that it will not cooperate with the probe.\n\nThe president\u2019s close evangelical advisers have issued dire warnings about the House\u2019s efforts. Texas pastor Robert Jeffress suggested that America will face a \u201cCivil War-like fracture\u201d if Trump is ultimately removed from office, while evangelist Franklin Graham predicted that \u201cour country could begin to unravel.\u201d\n\nBut the Christians who signed up to support this Sunday\u2019s day of prayer believe that an impeachment inquiry is a moral necessity, according to a letter released Tuesday by Red Letter Christians, a religious movement that is helping to organize the event.\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters Progressive Christians calling for a national day of prayer believe that the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is a moral necessity.\n\nThe idea for a national day of prayer arose organically last week at a Red Letter Revival event in Goldsboro, North Carolina, according to Rev. Peter G. Heltzel, a professor at New York Theological Seminary who helped put together the letter. Heltzel said that attendees at the social justice-focused event, which was planned as a counter-rally to the Greenville stop on Graham\u2019s \u201cDecision America\u201d tour, were appalled by the \u201chypocrisy of the religious right\u201d on the impeachment issue.\n\nLeaders like Graham are mistakenly leading American evangelicals to believe that their loyalty to the president comes before their loyalty to Christ, said Heltzel, who identifies as evangelical. But Christians are called to \u201cseek first the kingdom of God and God\u2019s justice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn this current moment, with the impeachment inquiry, Jesus\u2019s claim that he is the way, the truth and the life is also a call to prophetic holiness, in the sense of both speaking truth to power and demanding that authorities are truthful in their words and actions as they govern,\u201d Heltzel said.\n\nMembers of Congress invited to attend local congregations for National Day of Prayer for Impeachment Inquiry. #PrayForTruth pic.twitter.com/ZC6kgpxdNy \u2014 Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove (@wilsonhartgrove) October 8, 2019\n\nOn Sunday, organizers of the national day of prayer are asking Christian leaders to read the letter out loud to their congregations. Participants are also inviting their local congressional representatives to attend services so that the congregation can pray for them.\n\nThe letter insists that \u201cthis is not a matter of partisanship, but of deepest principle.\u201d Nonetheless, many of the signatories are heavyweights in the progressive Christian community \u2015 including Rev. Dr. William Barber II and Rev. Liz Theoharis, leaders of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign; Rev. Jim Wallis of Sojourners; Bishop Gene Robinson, the first openly gay Episcopal bishop; Rev. Traci Blackmon of the United Church of Christ; and Lisa Sharon Harper, writer and activist at FreedomRoad.us.\n\nSister Simone Campbell, a Catholic social justice activist known for her work with Nuns on the Bus, told HuffPost that she signed the letter because the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cundermining of truth and civility\u201d shocks her conscience. She said that the president\u2019s \u201cobsession with winning\u201d makes her doubt that he will ever focus on the needs of the American people.\n\n\u201cThis behavior on the part of the administration with regards to Ukraine evidences their lack of concern for the people of this nation. They only care about winning an election,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWinning is about power, not the common good.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m joining faith leaders from across the nation today to pray for House leadership & the impeachment inquiry. Please invite your Congressional rep to church this Sunday & pray for them. #PrayForTruth https://t.co/Wv9xFj3sd4 \u2014 Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II (@RevDrBarber) October 8, 2019\n\nSince winning about 81% of the white evangelical vote in 2016, Trump has depended on white evangelical leaders to defend his more controversial policies and rhetoric. Roughly 7 in 10 white evangelicals told the Pew Research Center in March that they approve of the way Trump is handling his job.\n\nPart of the impetus behind the letter was to counter the idea that all evangelicals are unquestionably loyal to the president. Rev. Laura Sumner Truax, senior pastor of Chicago\u2019s LaSalle Street Church and a self-described \u201cprogressive evangelical,\u201d said she\u2019s weary of Trump\u2019s \u201cbragging\u201d about evangelicals\u2019 support and upset that people like Graham and Jeffress are seen as spokespeople for the group.\n\nTruax said she signed the letter because she wanted to show that there\u2019s a broad network of people of faith whose religious beliefs have led them to a very different opinion of the president.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not willing to hold him accountable to the oath of office he swore in 2017, our silence comes at the expense of the most vulnerable, of those whose truth will no longer be honored,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pastor said that her congregation plans to read the letter, pray for Trump and pray that their representatives will seek the truth \u201cwherever it may lead.\u201d", "description": "Progressive Christians across the country are asking Congress to shed the \"light of truth\" on Trump.", "authors": ["Religion Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e69f3210000b908acc229.jpeg?cache=hsdbwhyhnz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
