Harbour stars in a commercial parody alongside cast member Kyle Mooney as a father and son who desperately need a way to emotionally connect. It can be tough these days for fathers to create long-lasting, emotional bonds with their sons, but thankfully SNL has created the perfect solution: the \u201cFather-Son Podcasting Microphone.\u201d It conveniently gets rid of all the awkward feelings that men have about actually having a raw conversation with their child, because if it\u2019s on a podcast, it\u2019s okay! Plus, when things get too intense, \u201cyou can always shift gears with a quick commercial!\u201d Thank you, SNL, for all of the fathers and sons you are saving with this genius invention: \u201cIt just has to get you through three awkward years before you can both start drinking together.\u201d\n\nRelated", "description": "During David Harbour\u2019s episode of \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 he starred alongside Kyle Mooney in a very funny commercial parody for the \u201cFather-Son Podcasting Microphone.\u201d", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/12/snl-david-harbour-podcasting-microphone.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
