The adults, in contrast to their offspring, have black fur.\n\nThe week-old Francois' langur has not yet been named. He stands out because his fur is bright orange, compared to the black hair of his mother, Noel\n\n'Seeing Francois' Langurs in the wild is incredibly rare, but seeing a baby is even more so,' said senior zookeeper, Jane Marshall.\n\nThe baby's bright orange hair will last just a couple more weeks before it begins to darken to the black fur its mother, Noel, has.\n\n'It\u2019s very interesting seeing the females in the group interact and care for the baby, Ms Marshall added.\n\n'They all clearly care for him very much, and pass him to one another throughout the day.\n\n'Not a lot of people know about Francois' Langurs as a species, but these beautiful animals are very vibrant animals, who are incredibly agile and intelligent.'\n\nFran\u00e7ois\u2019 Langurs live in groups of females called harems.\n\nThe adults in the group take turns looking after the babies, which helps the new mothers to cope with their duties while also letting others practise motherhood.\n\nA newly-born male Francois' Langur, one of the world's rarest monkeys, staying close to his mother Noel at the Taronga Zoo in Sydney\n\nThe zoo has celebrated a birth of this rare species before when one of its other females, Meili, gave birth to Nangua in November 2015.\n\nNoel, the new baby's mother, used to carry Nangua around about half of the time when he was newborn, the keepers said four years ago.\n\nAnd now Noel has a baby of her own and the tables have turned, as other females in the group are helping to care for him.\n\nTaronga Zoo is the only zoo in Australia to have a population of Francois\u2019 Langurs. In the UK, babies have been born at Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire and zoos in Belfast and Kent.\n\nThe animals were once abundant in the Far East but, because of poaching, logging and building work destroying their habitats, have become endangered.\n\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the species as endangered since 2008.", "description": "A Francois langur monkey baby has been born at Taronga Zoo in Sydney, the only zoo in Australia to have the monkeys. Native to China, they are now endangered because of poaching and logging.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/07/wire-19285362-1570169554-37_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
