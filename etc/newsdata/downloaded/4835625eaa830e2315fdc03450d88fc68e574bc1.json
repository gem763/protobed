This morning, October 23, CBS devoted a full hour of its morning show to the \u201cStop the Stigma\u201d initiative to raise awareness for mental health dialogue and treatment.\n\nAlong with experts and representatives from the National Alliance on Mental Illness and other support organizations, the network drew on the personal experiences of Karamo Brown, Cynthia Germanotta, and Jane Pauley, who are people and parents impacted by depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and other forms of mental illness.\n\nEach of the featured guests gave unique insights from their journeys to health and hope. CBS deserves credit for devoting much more than a cursory glance for these very personal issues during Mental Health Awareness Month.\n\nHelp for all colors\n\nKaramo Brown has a light emanating from his spirit in his work with subjects on the Netflix incarnation of \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d but dark thoughts came over the actor, mentor, and motivator at a very young age.\n\nFor Karamo Brown, it felt as if the light of the sun \u201cwas getting darker each day,\u201d as a teenager. His faith-filled family encouraged their son to \u201cpray it away,\u201d and Brown does believe there is a place for faith and prayer, but he needed something \u201cin here\u201d (pointing to his core) to relieve the feeling that a tremendous weight was making even the smallest task seem impossible.\n\nKaramo Brown made a commitment to \u201cbe better,\u201d but the man who truly takes into the streets with clients on \u201cQueer Eye\u201d saw that mental health support seemed to be only for \u201crich white people,\u201d and never for those in lower social economic rungs.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

TV Shows Celebrities\n\nThere was a time for Brown when things became so dark that he thought \u201cthis is never going to get better.\u201d One of the paths he took that changed that thinking was his work for many years in social services, and his work with LGBTQ youth, a group six times as likely to die from suicide. The habit of setting \u201cdaily emotional goals\u201d has been particularly helpful to Karamo Brown, who recently revealed his relationship with his father had been repaired after he came out as gay.\n\nA dipping daughter\n\nCynthia Germanotta stands shoulder to shoulder with her superstar daughter, Stefani, in advocating for mental health, inclusion, and acceptance through her role in running the Born This Way Foundation. The two are often compared as twins, and Lady Gaga utilizes every moment of her spotlights and platforms to urge those in need to seek help to restore mental health, and for those around them to listen and care.\n\nStefani Germanotta was born a unique spirit with boundlessly unique gifts, but her mother started to see her \u201chappy and aspirational young girl\u201d become someone who doubted and questioned everything about herself. Lady Gaga has had similar experiences, such as being thrown into a trashcan during her middle school years. Like many parents of her generation, Cynthia Germanotta relied on her own \u201cgenerational grit to suck it up\u201d as an initial approach.\n\nShe understands how coping with mental illness can shift the focus of the family onto one individual and result in guilt for the parent. Germanotta declared that her daughter needed her feelings to be heard and validated, and not necessarily solved. Listening is an essential lifeline that anyone can give. Being open and vulnerable about personal struggles with mental health is also helpful.\n\nAn unexpected battle\n\nJane Pauley is now among the esteemed veteran broadcasters in the CBS stable, hosting \u201cSunday Morning\u201d each weekend. In 2001, however, a mental health battle came to her doorstep in a very unexpected way.\n\nThe Emmy-winning co-anchor of \u201cToday\u201d and CBS was not aware of any susceptibility or history of mental illness when she was given medication for hives in 2001 that ultimately manifested itself with a genetic vulnerability to bipolar disorder. Jane Pauley was in \u201cpretty serious condition\u201d by the time her husband, Gary Trudeau, was informed. She spent weeks under psychiatric treatment, and her doctor offered a \u201ccover story\u201d of being under treatment for a thyroid condition to her employers.\n\nJane Pauley knew that the only way to redeem the situation was to talk about it and to let others know that they are not alone. She prefers to defer the word \u201cstigma\u201d from the discussion of mental illness, because the word is a stigma itself, in the journalist\u2019s mind. \u201cWe have to fight the stigma with sophistication,\u201d Pauley describes.\n\nHonesty, hope, and open hearts are all something in common for Karamo Brown, Cynthia Germanotta, and Jane Pauley. The struggle in each of their stories with mental illness crosses generations, but their voices for overcoming in mental health struggles will never be silenced.", "description": "Personalities with big platforms share perspectives as people and parents who feel the deep impact of mental health issues and treatment.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Ramon Sanchez", "Read More On The Same Topic Tresa Patterson", "The Good Doctor' Season", "Episode", "First Case Second Base", "Surgery Loss Is Still A Win", "When Calls The Heart S", "Erin Krakow Sends Social Media Messages Of Support", "Hawaii Five-O"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/23/os/b_1200x630/karamo-brown-of-netflixs-queer-eye-was-an-impassioned-advocate-for-mental-health-on-cbs-stop-the-stigma-image-source-ctm-youtube_2343809.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
