The feature is designed to be a handy way to give yourself some extra screen real estate, especially if you regularly carry around both an iPad and an Apple laptop. The Verge\u2019s Dieter Bohn called it his favorite new feature on Catalina in our review.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch if you\u2019re excited to use Sidecar with your laptop: if you\u2019ve been holding out on buying an Apple laptop without the troubled butterfly keyboard, you can\u2019t use Sidecar. According to an Apple white paper, the only laptops that Sidecar works on are:\n\nMacBooks from 2016 or later (the second generation of Apple\u2019s ultra-thin [and now gone] laptop line)\n\nMacBook Airs from 2018 or later (Apple\u2019s recent redesign of the MacBook Air)\n\nMacBook Pros from 2016 or later (Apple switched to butterfly keys in the Pros in 2016)\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing to see that Sidecar doesn\u2019t work on any older laptops without the company\u2019s perpetually troubled butterfly keyboard, which has gone through three iterations and is now covered under an extended warranty program Apple launched last year specifically to address the issue for certain models.\n\nBut the limited number of supported Macs for Sidecar may in fact be due to chipsets, as Apple\u2019s white paper says the feature requires Intel\u2019s Skylake or newer CPUs. As noted by an astute AppleInsider forums user, Skylake adds support for the HEVC video codec, which suggests the mirroring feature could rely on the codec to share what\u2019s on your Mac\u2019s display with your iPad. We don\u2019t know for sure that\u2019s the case, but it does seem quite plausible.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need a relatively new iPad to use Sidecar, too, and it will have to support Apple Pencil. Apple says all iPad Pros are supported, as well as the 6th gen or newer iPad, 5th gen iPad mini, and the 3rd gen iPad Air. And no matter which you use, it will need to be running iPadOS 13.\n\nApple says Sidecar also works on desktop Macs with Skylake chipsets or newer, including:\n\nMac minis from 2018 or later\n\niMacs from late 2015 or later\n\niMac Pros\n\nThe upcoming 2019 Mac Pro\n\nUpdate October 7th, 8:25PM ET: Clarified that Sidecar also works on desktop Macs, and added the list of desktop Macs that support Sidecar.", "description": "Apple released macOS Catalina today, and one of its marquee features is Sidecar, which lets you use your iPad as a second display for your Mac.
