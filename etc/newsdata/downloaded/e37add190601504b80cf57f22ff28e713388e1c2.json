The dividend is likely to be paid on Dec 2, to stockholders of record as of Oct 17. On an annualized basis, the company hiked its dividend by roughly $500 million.\n\nMoreover, ConocoPhillips has announced its intention to buy back stocks worth $3 billion in 2020. Both the dividend hike and share buyback program reflect the company\u2019s strong focus on returning cash to shareholders consistently.\n\nImportantly, the upstream energy player has long been spending capital within cashflows, reflecting the company\u2019s prime intention of returning shareholders\u2019 cash rather than focusing on absolute production growth. In fact, ConocoPhillips has reaffirmed that it will continue to return more than 30% of its operating cashflow every year through both dividend payment and stock repurchases.\n\nIn other words, the slowdown in the broader energy sector, as the weaknesses in crude pricing scenario prevails, couldn\u2019t stop the company from increasing dividend and planning stock repurchases. This commitment is getting reflected in ConocoPhillips\u2019 stock price, which has outperformed both the industry and the sector year to date.\n\nCurrently, ConocoPhillips which is headquartered in Houston, TX, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
