Koch is also on her way to making history with a 300-day mission, which will be the longest single spaceflight by a woman.\n\nKoch and Meir were asked in an interview from space on Friday about whether they mind having their accomplishments qualified by their gender, i.e. the first all-female spacewalk and longest spaceflight by a woman.\n\n.@Astro_Christina and @Astro_Jessica are scheduled for a spacewalk together on Oct. 21. They recently talked about how their accomplishments are viewed in terms of being female astronauts. pic.twitter.com/yTJ0kVH40f \u2014 Intl.

All the women that worked to get us where we are today. I think the nice thing for us is we don\u2019t even really think about it on a daily basis. It\u2019s just normal. We\u2019re part of the team.\"", "description": "Astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir will lead the spacewalk on Oct. 21.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/nasa-ap-er-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
