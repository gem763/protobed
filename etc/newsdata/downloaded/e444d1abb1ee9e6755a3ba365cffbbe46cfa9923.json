They are all Ethiopian nationals,\" Mulamu said.\n\nShe added the men did not speak fluent English, which resulted in officers struggling to communicate with them.\n\nMulamu said an interpreter was also not immediately available to assist but it was clear from their reaction they had been kept against their will.\n\nA man, who is suspected of being one of the human traffickers, was arrested.\n\n\"The suspect, who is also Ethiopian, is expected to appear in the Booysens Magistrate's Court on Monday and faces charges of human trafficking or smuggling,\" said Mulamu.\n\nMeanwhile, the men have been taken for processing because no documents confirming their identities were found in the house.\n\nMulamu said it was difficult to ascertain their ages but they all seemed to be adults.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
