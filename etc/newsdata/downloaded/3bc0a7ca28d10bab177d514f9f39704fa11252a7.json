Currently it only works in a \"manual\" mode, meaning it needs user interaction to execute correctly.\n\nMetasploit operators must feed it a parameter with information about the system they want to target. This means the exploit can't be used in an automated manner as a self-spreading worm, but will work for targeted attacks.\n\nFor example, a hacker group who gained access to a corporate network can deploy it on a system-by-system basis, and eventually hack into all nearby workstations one by one, if it has enough time at its disposal.\n\nFurthermore, the BlueKeep Metasploit module also only works against 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2, but not the other Windows versions that were also vulnerable to BlueKeep. This small fact also narrows down its possible use for criminal endeavors, although, it does not rule it out.\n\n700,000 systems still vulnerable\n\nAltough a module was released today, security experts don't expect to see malware campaigns or hacks leveraging right away.\n\nJust like with everything else, there is usually a learning curve even with hackers, as they get used to a tool.\n\nNonethless, by the time black-hats get used to the module, there will still be plenty of vulnerable systems around. This is because despite having had nearly four months to patch the BlueKeep vulnerability, most users and companies failed to apply Microsoft's patches.\n\nAccording to a BinaryEdge scan, there are still 700,000 systems vulnerable to BlueKeep exposed on the internet, and possibly millions more inside firewalled networks.", "description": "Metasploit BlueKeep module can achieve code execution, is easy to use.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/09/33970abf-5012-4274-b2cd-247562f0acd8/thumbnail/770x578/ff64abc22e2e6eb9adf6f952e5279bbc/bluekeep-researchers-show-how-dangerous-5d1ca6aa2f64e300c2bf415b-1-jul-09-2019-12-05-08-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
