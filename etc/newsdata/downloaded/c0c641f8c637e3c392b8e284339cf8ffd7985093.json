He tweaked his knee when setting up Adams' hat-trick try against Fiji and had a scan that came back showing little damage.\n\nGeorge North is one of four big names to have been passed fit to face France this weekend\n\nWALES TEAM TO FACE FRANCE L Williams; North, J Davies, Parkes, Adams; Biggar, G Davies; W Jones, Owens, Francis, Ball, AWJ, Wainwright, Tipuric, Navidi Bench: Dee, Carre, Lewis, Beard, Moriarty, T Williams, Patchell, Watkin\n\nDavies will have his left leg heavily strapped for the match, but has been doing extra movement drills in training this week and is ready to start.\n\nAs one of Wales' world-class operators - and a man they cannot replace - it is vital that he is fit.\n\nGatland has preferred Aaron Wainwright to Ross Moriarty in the back-row, keeping the first choice side from the first two World Cup matches. This is exactly the same XV that beat Australia 29-25 in the Pool stages.\n\nDan Biggar, pictured in training on Friday, will take his place in the Wales side on Sunday\n\nIt is a huge show of faith in 22-year-old Wainwright, who only started his rugby career four years ago and has won 16 caps since.\n\nOn the bench there are changes too, with Rhys Carre - who has just three caps - and Adam Beard among the replacements. There is no role for Leigh Halfpenny as Owen Watkin is preferred.\n\nWales have only ever made two semi-finals in their history, in 1987 and 2011, the latter one when they lost to France 9-8 when Sam Warburton was sent off.\n\nIf they lose it will be Gatland's last match in charge of Wales after 11 years and more than 120 Tests in the job.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN BEPPU: The quartet had knocks to their knee, ankle, thigh and head respectively but they are passed fit to play in what is a major boost to Warren Gatland.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/06/19871134-0-image-a-5_1571376174126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
