She was \u201cenjoying the sunshine and the rest of my day off after returning from the memorial service of a friend who died far too soon.\u201d\n\nWhile relaxing, she noticed a dog plop down on her yard.\n\nToday I was sitting on my porch, enjoying the sunshine and the rest of my day off after returning from the memorial service of a friend who died far too soon. A woman and her dog stopped at my yard, and the dog plopped down on my grass. 1/ \u2014 Kate Howard (@JournoKateH) October 15, 2019\n\nHoward said that the dog was particularly \u201ccharming\u201d and when her owner came over to get to her move, the dog, named Winnie, did not want to budge.\n\nThe dog was cute, a brown pitty girl with white markings. All dogs are perfect but she was particular charming. Her owner was trying to get her rolling again but she was staying put. She called her.\n\n\u201cWinnie! Come on!\u201d\n\nHer name was Winnie! 2/ \u2014 Kate Howard (@JournoKateH) October 15, 2019\n\nUpon hearing the dog\u2019s name, Howard immediately remembered a puppy she had fostered last November.\n\n\u201cShe was a soft wiggly baby puppy I named Winnie. I cried for three days after she was spayed and went up for adoption, worrying about whether she had found a good home,\u201d Howard wrote in a post that included a few pictures of the adorable pup.\n\nThis immediately registered because last November, I fostered a dog for the first time over Thanksgiving. She was a soft wiggly baby puppy I named Winnie. I cried for three days after she was spayed and went up for adoption, worrying about whether she had found a good home. 3/ pic.twitter.com/KDFiHKcGzG \u2014 Kate Howard (@JournoKateH) October 15, 2019\n\nThe story then takes a very serendipitous turn.\n\n\u201cI asked the woman whether she adopted Winnie with that name,\u201d Howard wrote in another tweet. \u201cShe said yes, as she didn\u2019t want to change her name and confuse her.\u201d\n\nHoward then asked the owner if she adopted Winnie last November \u2014 and, it turns out, she had.\n\n\u201cBy then, I was practically leaping off the porch screaming. I FOSTERED THIS DOGGGGGG.\u201d\n\nI asked the woman whether she adopted Winnie with that name. She said yes, as she didn\u2019t want to change her name and confuse her. I asked when \u2014 she said last November. By then, I was practically leaping off the porch screaming. I FOSTERED THIS DOGGGGGG 4/ pic.twitter.com/7OuMyodTvo \u2014 Kate Howard (@JournoKateH) October 15, 2019\n\nHoward then revealed how much Winnie meant to her during their time together.\n\nI told her I was so worried about whether she found a good home that I asked the shelter to put my name in her file in case she was ever brought back, an unfortunate but not uncommon outcome. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI would NEVER bring her back!\u201d She is a great, well-behaved pup. 5/ \u2014 Kate Howard (@JournoKateH) October 15, 2019\n\nHoward also discovered that Winnie\u2019s owner had recently lost a dog.\n\nIt turns out Winnie\u2019s mom had recently lost a dog. When saw Winnie\u2019s precious face on the Animal Services web site, she got to the adoption site EARLY, intent on making sure she was first in line to adopt her when she became available. 5/ \u2014 Kate Howard (@JournoKateH) October 15, 2019\n\nHoward then learned that Winnie lives only a block away from her new home and emphasized the significance of running into Winnie again on that particular day.\n\nAccording to Howard, that day would have typically been a workday for her, but she took it off to go to her friend\u2019s memorial, a person, she notes, was a \u201ctremendous lover of dogs.\u201d\n\nNow, I just moved into this house a couple months ago. And it turns out this house is a block over from Winnie! I would have been at work, not on my porch, this afternoon if not for traveling from the memorial service of my friend Heidi, a tremendous lover of dogs. 6/ \u2014 Kate Howard (@JournoKateH) October 15, 2019\n\nHoward ended her thread by saying that running into Winnie on that day was \u201cbeyond comforting\u201d and posted an updated photo of Winnie in \u201call her grown-up glory.\u201d\n\nIt was beyond comforting for my first foster dog to turn up on my front lawn today, her fur still soft and her ear still crooked and her tail still wagging. Here she is in all her grown-up glory and I hope she warms your heart too! #RescueDogs #AdoptDontShop 7/ pic.twitter.com/aEChtd83cY \u2014 Kate Howard (@JournoKateH) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cI hope she warms your heart too!\u201d Howard, who did not immediately return a request for comment, concluded.\n\nWell, mission accomplished.", "description": "The mourning woman shared the sweet and serendipitous tale in a viral Twitter thread.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da5ea782100003c0facfa57.jpeg?cache=1r1lpsvs58&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
