In particular, some parts of eastern Canada with cannabis production facilities\u2014like Smith Falls, Ont.\u2014have had real estate booms. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: The results counter a January RE/MAX consumer survey, which found that 65 per cent of Canadians would not want to live near a cannabis storefront\u2014at the time, the firm interpreted this result as a risk for local housing prices. Canadian survey respondents seem to overestimate pot\u2019s effect on real estate\u2014another survey conducted by listings firm Zoocasa in early October found that 32 per cent of Canadians think dispensaries lower housing prices in an area, though that figure is down 10 per cent from a year ago. Overall, legal cannabis has added $8.26 billion to Canada\u2019s GDP since legalization a year ago, though the industry has faced significant hurdles, including a dearth of storefronts, lower-than-expected sales and the widespread decline of pot stocks.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
