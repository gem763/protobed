Liverpool The most popular set of kits in the country. Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\nOpening New Balance's case last week, Daniel Oudkerk QC said the key issue in the case was whether New Balance had matched \"the material, measurable and matchable terms of a third-party offer\".\n\nLiverpool argued that New Balance had not matched Nike's offer, which includes a commitment to sell licensed products in \"not less than 6,000 stores worldwide, 500 of which shall be Nike owned\".\n\nBut Mr Oudkerk said New Balance has \"approximately 40,000-odd retail doors globally\".\n\nIn his written case, Mr Oudkerk argued that Liverpool dismissed New Balance's offer to match terms as the club was \"wedded to Nike\", and that \"it appears that the club had resolved to reject the New Balance match come what may\".\n\nGuy Morpuss QC, representing the club, argued that the claim was \"really an attempt by New Balance to use a matching clause for a purpose for which it was never intended\".\n\nHe said New Balance's contention it could distribute Liverpool kit to 40,000 stores was \"a myth\", adding that the company had \"grossly overstated\" the number of stores it could distribute to.\n\n\"The idea that New Balance would even get football kit into anything close to those 40,000 stores is utterly fanciful,\" Mr Morpuss added.\n\nIn written submissions, Mr Morpuss said that New Balance's claim to be able to match Nike's 6,000-store offer was \"inconsistent with New Balance's historic performance\" and \"manifestly implausible\", adding that the company had used \"a series of artificial devices to pretend that it could reach the 6,000 figure\".", "description": "Liverpool FC have won a High Court battle over a multimillion-pound sponsorship deal with American sportswear giant New Balance. The club was sued over its alleged refusal to honour the terms of its reported \u00a340million-a-year deal with the company, which expires in May 2020. Under the terms of the deal, New Balance was entitled to renew its sponsorship if it matches the terms", "authors": ["Sam Tobin"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/08/nike-liverpool.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
