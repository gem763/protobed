Farrow, who famously helped expose Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator and launched the #MeToo movement, reported new claims against Lauer directly from his accuser, according to the Variety bombshell. (Fox News has not seen a copy of the book.)\n\n\u2018TODAY\u2019 ADDRESSES \u2018APPALLING\u2019 NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT\u2019S JUST VERY PAINFUL'\n\nLauer denied the graphic rape claim in a strongly worded letter that his lawyer provided to Variety on Wednesday, in which the former \u201cToday\u201d co-host said he was initially quiet for the sake of his children -- but will now defend himself.\n\n\u201cIt is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault. It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,\u201d Lauer wrote.\n\n\u201cI had an extramarital affair with [a colleague] in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts... each act was mutual and completely consensual,\u201d Lauer added.\n\nBut Farrow wrote that the former NBC News employee -- whose complaint eventually led to Lauer\u2019s firing in 2017 -- said the incident occurred after she ran into Lauer at a hotel bar over drinks with Meredith Viera during the Sochi games, according to the report.\n\nRONAN FARROW'S TEAM 'CONFIDENT IN THE FACTS' IN NEW #METOO BOOK, DISMISSES LEGAL THREAT FROM EX-NATIONAL ENQUIRER EDITOR\n\nFox News is not naming the alleged victim at this time, despite Farrow, Variety and Lauer\u2019s attorney each revealing her identity.\n\nFarrow reportedly wrote that the alleged victim went to Lauer\u2019s hotel room twice that night, first because Lauer jokingly took her press credentials and a second time because the ex-NBC News host invited her back.\n\nShe \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience,\u201d Farrow wrote, according to Variety.\n\nThe alleged victim reportedly told Farrow that on the second visit to his room, Lauer kissed her against the door then flipped her over on the bed and asked her if she \u201cliked anal sex.\u201d\n\nMSNBC'S MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY\n\nFarrow reportedly wrote that the alleged victim said she didn\u2019t want to partake in the act several times before she eventually cried into a pillow while Lauer proceeded without her consent. According to Variety, the alleged victim indicated that she was in pain for several days after the 'nonconsensual\" incident.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague,\u201d NBC News said in a statement to Fox News.\n\nNeither Lauer nor his attorney immediately responded to Fox News\u2019 requests for additional comment.\n\n'HARASSMENT STILL GOES UNPUNISHED' AT NBC NEWS EVEN AFTER MATT LAUER DISMISSAL, FORMER CORRESPONDENT ALLEGES\n\nIn the letter provided to Variety, Lauer said the story the alleged victim told \u201cis filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter.\u201d\n\nThe new allegations drew a sharp and somber reaction from the disgraced anchor\u2019s former colleagues on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show Wednesday.\n\n\u201cToday\u201d co-host Savannah Guthrie was clearly emotional when reporting the latest on Lauer.\n\nLINDA VESTER: MATT LAUER WAS FIRED A YEAR AGO \u2013 NBC NEWS' CULTURE IS COMCAST'S FAILURE\n\n\u201cI feel like we owe it to our viewers to pause for a moment, you know, this is shocking and appalling,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it.\u201d\n\nThe Peacock Network then aired a statement from NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, who is a key figure in the Variety report himself.\n\n\"Our highest priority is to ensure we have a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected. We are absolutely committed to making this a reality. There can be no exception,\u201d Lack said.\n\nFarrow also reportedly wrote in his upcoming tell-all that the alleged victim had more sexual encounters with Lauer once they were back in New York and sources close to Lauer said she sometimes initiated them.\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED TO ACCUSE\n\n\"This is what I blame myself most for,\u201d she reportedly told Farrow. \u201cIt was completely transactional. It was not a relationship.\u201d\n\nLauer, through his attorney, also addressed this detail in the letter denying her claim.\n\n\u201cShe claims our first encounter was an assault, yet she actively participated in arranging future meetings and met me at my apartment on multiple occasions to continue the affair,\u201d Lauer wrote. \u201cShe says I was the one pursuing the relationship, yet once it was over, she was the one calling me asking to rekindle it.\u201d\n\nLauer also wrote, \u201cFor two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations. They have avoided having to look a boyfriend, husband, or a child in the eye and say, \u2018I cheated.\u2019 They have done enormous damage in the process. And I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nFarrow was an NBC News employee when his Weinstein reporting helped launch the #MeToo movement in 2017.
