A blame game against the European Union, against Ireland, against Mrs Merkel, against the British judicial system, against Labour, against the Lib Dems, even against Mrs May,\" he said.\n\n\"The only one who is not to be blamed is Mr Johnson himself, apparently. But all the rest are the source of our problems. That is what is happening today. All those who are not playing his game are 'traitors' or a 'collaborator', or 'surrenderers'.\n\n\"Well in my opinion, dear colleagues the real traitor is he or she who risks bringing disaster upon his country, its economy, and its citizens, by pushing Britain out of the European Union. That is in my opinion, a traitor.\"\n\nMr Verhofstadt's incendiary remarks come after Boris Johnson and other Brexiteers were criticised for adopting hardline rhetoric themselves, branding a bill to prevent no-deal the \"Surrender Act\" and calling for \"Britain first\" policies.\n\nIn the same debate Brexit Party MEP Martin Daubney hit back at Mr Verhofstadt's speech, telling him: \"You don't respect democracy ... you've lost, my friend, goodbye.\"\n\nMr Verhofstadt also criticised Leave-leaning Labour MPs who had said they would vote for Mr Johnson's proposal. He noted that the plan removed protections for environmental, social and labour standard protections that Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement included.\n\n\"That should be contrary to all the things Labour has defended in the past,\" he said.\n\nRead more\n\nEU Brexit negotiator tears apart Boris Johnson's plan point by point", "description": "The European Parliament's Brexit chief has branded Brexiteers \"the real traitors\", in a significant escalation of rhetoric from Brussels.Speaking in a debate in the EU's legislature Guy Verhofstadt accused Boris Johnson of blaming everyone but himself for the situation the UK found", "authors": ["Jon Stone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ryb5d_oRMHCnUGAuYsGgiw--~B/aD0zNDY7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/410d202c870e58821607dbd1356723f8", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
