So when you watch Kamaru Usman \u2013 like, my teammate Michael Chandler is his training partner \u2013 when you watch those guys scramble, going around, this is high-level scrambling.\n\n\u201cI think Usman has a slight edge that is annoying and frustrating to deal with and if he can\u2019t get space, he may not be able to punch Colby, and that takes his advantage in striking away.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret Woodley is not Covington\u2019s biggest fan. The two were meant to fight when Woodley was the champion and Covington was interim champ, but the fight never came to fruition.\n\nBut \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d did give Covington credit for his cardio, which was on full display when he dominated former champion Robbie Lawler in August, pushing the pace for five rounds.\n\nWoodley thinks Covington does a good job conserving his energy.\n\n\u201cI think he really, really has a good motor,\u201d Woodley said. \u201cI think he\u2019s in good shape. But it\u2019s not like he\u2019s in good shape because he\u2019s landing explosive, powerful combinations. He\u2019s not exerting his body, throwing powerful shots. He actually punched like he\u2019s swinging little Ottoman cushions around. But when you really think about it, he never has to explode.\u201d\n\nWhile Woodley would love nothing more than another crack at the title, he\u2019s willing to fight anyone. He didn\u2019t seem too keen on a potential Leon Edwards fight, even though Edwards might be the most realistic and available option for him. But for now, Woodley says he\u2019s done saying who he wants to fight next.\n\nHe says just call his manager.\n\n\u201cAnybody can get that (expletive) whooped, but when you want to know who, when, where and how much, call Malki Kawa \u2013 he\u2019ll let you know the details,\u201d Woodley said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to whoop everybody\u2019s (expletive).\u201d", "description": "Former welterweight champion Tyron Woodley, gives slight edge to Kamaru Usman over Colby Covington at UFC 245.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "The Blue Corner", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Ken Hathaway", "Mmajunkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/kamaru-usman-tyron-woodley-ufc-235-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
