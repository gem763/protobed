Later that day, the agreement was approved by the leaders of the other 27 Member States, known as the EU27.\n\nBritish MPs will vote on the deal tomorrow. Reports suggest there may be enough votes to get the bill over the line. However, the DUP said it would reject the offer, as will the majority of the Opposition, meaning a loss for the government cannot be ruled out.\n\nAn extension to Article 50 \u2014 delaying Brexit for the third time \u2014 would also need to be approved by the EU27 unanimously. This means that one country\u2019s veto could result in a clean-break Brexit.\n\nMr Macron said during a press conference at the end of the European Summit on Friday afternoon that he hopes the 31st of October deadline is \u201crespected\u201d and described the new deal as \u201cgood\u201d.\n\nThe French president continued: \u201cSo that we can turn to the future I believe that we shall stick to the deadline of October 31.\n\n\u201cThat being said, I\u2019m not trying to read the future, but I do not think we shall grant any further delay.\n\n\u201cI believe it is now time to put an end to these negotiations and work on the future relationship and put an end to what is currently ongoing.\n\n\u201cLike I said, there shall be no delay unless there are some major changes.\u201d\n\nPresident vs President: Tusk Contradicts Juncker, Says Brexit Delay Could Happen https://t.co/9esbLy7JFD \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 18, 2019\n\nWhile European leaders, including Macron, have rejected extensions in the past, Brexit was delayed twice since the original exit date of March 29th, 2019.\n\nHowever, October 31st represents not just Brexit Day, but the end of the current term for European institutions. Presidencies for key offices like of the European Council and the European Commission officially change hands on November 1st. In May, Mr Macron had said that he wants the UK out of the EU by Halloween to stop Brexit \u201cpolluting\u201d the EU\u2019s new agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly said privately to EU leaders that a Brexit extension would be unavoidable if MPs rejected the new deal.\n\nSimilar inconsistencies in message came from Brussels bureaucrats on Thursday. President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that Brexit \u201chas to happen now\u201d and that \u201cthere will be no other prolongation\u201d.\n\nHowever, hours later the president of the European Council, who chairs the council of leaders of European nations, appeared to contradict the president of the bloc\u2019s powerful executive arm.\n\nDonald Tusk said during a press conference: \u201cI have no idea what will be the result of the debate in the House of Commons on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to comment on political developments in the UK. But if there\u2019s a request for an extension, I will consult member states to see how to react.\u201d", "description": "Emmanuel Macron has indicated that the EU will not grant a further extension to Article 50 if British MPs vote down the new proposed deal.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Emmanuel-Macron-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
