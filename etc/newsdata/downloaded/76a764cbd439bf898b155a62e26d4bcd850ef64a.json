REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\n\u201cI think we can have a deal\u201d Juncker said in an interview with Sky News, adding that he didn\u2019t know if the chances of a deal were more than 50-50.\n\nThe contentious backstop - an insurance policy to keep the sensitive Irish border open and free of border controls under any circumstances after Brexit - has so far proven to be the main stumbling block in the tortuous Brexit talks.\n\nJuncker reiterated that he didn\u2019t have a special attachment to the backstop if another solution was found in the negotiations with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n\u201cAs far as the so-called alternative arrangements are concerned, allowing us and Britain to achieve the main objectives of the backstop ... if the results are there, I don\u2019t care about the instrument,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the objectives are met, all of them, then we don\u2019t need the backstop.\u201d\n\nSterling hit a two-month high versus the dollar on Juncker\u2019s comments, rising to $1.2546, its highest since July 19.\n\nJuncker\u2019s comments were clips taken from a longer interview to be broadcast on Sunday.\n\nAsked about reports that Northern Ireland could follow EU rules on food and agriculture with other checks being done away from the border, the journalist who interviewed Juncker quoted him as saying: \u201cIt is the basis of a deal... it is the starting point and the arrival point.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s predecessor as Prime Minister, Theresa May, drew up the current Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union but repeatedly failed to get British lawmakers to back it, with the backstop a major sticking point. She resigned earlier this year.\n\nUnder the backstop, May agreed that the UK would be tied to the EU\u2019s trading and other rules unless and until another solution is found for the Irish border issue.\n\nLondon proposed to Brussels earlier this month that common rules for checking animals and animal products could be established across the island of Ireland as part of an alternative to the backstop arrangement.", "description": "A Brexit deal is possible, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday, adding that if the Irish border backstop which the British government wants removed could be replaced with alternatives, it would not be needed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431891344&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1PF", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
