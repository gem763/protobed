That\u2019s a huge game, and will likely decide if Argentina stays or goes home after the group stage.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s intensity is not enough to play against England,\u201d Ledesma said. \u201cWith so many missed tackles and losing the ball so much, it will be difficult for us to play against England.\u201d\n\nA rout appeared to be on the cards after hooker Julian Montoya\u2019s hat trick of tries and one from winger Santiago Carreras - all converted by flyhalf Benjamin Urdapilleta and all before Tonga has scored a point.\n\nInstead, Tonga rallied with two fine tries from fullback Telusa Veainu, who looked sharp on his return from a nagging foot injury.\n\nThis was a comfortable win, and finally snapped a 10-game losing streak, but the way Tonga got back into the game and pushed hard for a third try concerned Ledesma.\n\n\u201cWe need to maintain our focus and concentration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost our focus a bit.\u201d\n\nHis team changes included dropping mainstay flyhalf Nicolas Sanchez and handing Urdapilleta his first start since June 2013.\n\nMontoya had scored a try as a replacement against France, and now has four after replacing former captain Agustin Creevy in the starting XV.\n\nThese might prove the easiest tries he\u2019ll get, such was Tonga\u2019s poor defending early on. Carreras was also a new pick on the left wing, and the 21-year-old got his first international try.\n\nIt all seemed so easy at this point, with not even 30 minutes played.\n\n\u201cJust errors, poor skill, bit of miscommunication. Typical Tier Two errors,\u201d said Tonga coach Toutai Kefu, who won the 1999 World Cup as a player for Australia. \u201cYou can\u2019t let Tier One teams get ahead like that. But I\u2019m proud of how the boys fronted up physically.\u201d\n\nBut Tonga woke up with a well-taken try from Veainu - a neat side-step into the left corner from the Leicester Tigers favorite.\n\n\u201cHe offers us an X-factor out wide,\u201d Kefu said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have him back. Having a player of his caliber and class is fantastic for us.\u201d\n\nFlanker Tomas Lavanini prevented a second Tonga try on the half-time buzzer, barging winger David Halaifonua out of bounds in the left corner. The try was ruled out, although there were questions over the tackle.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a shoulder charge. If we would have got that (try) we would have come out in the second half with a lot more belief and confidence,\u201d Kefu said. \u201cThere were a couple of 50-50 (decisions) today we didn\u2019t get.\u201d\n\nAfter the break, the pace of the contest dropped at a humid 22,000-capacity Hanazono Rugby Stadium.\n\nArgentine scrumhalf Tomas Cubelli had a try ruled out in the 52nd minute for a knock-on, following a referral to the television match official.\n\nTonga improved, and Veainu did well to squeeze into the right corner for a try confirmed after a review.\n\nSanchez went on as a replacement and missed a late penalty in a poor second half from Argentina.\n\nTonga faces three-time runner-up France next weekend.\n\nKefu sounded confident Tonga can repeat its upset World Cup win over France eight years ago.\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d he said. But, \u201cBut we need to address those errors and be a lot more clinical to be competitive.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Argentina has been a team of two halves so far at the Rugby World Cup, and coach Mario Ledesma does not like it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
