A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nRead judge's ruling by kballuck1 on Scribd", "description": "A federal judge knocked the Department of Justice (DOJ) stance that a sitting president can\u2019t be indicted in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100419as7_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
