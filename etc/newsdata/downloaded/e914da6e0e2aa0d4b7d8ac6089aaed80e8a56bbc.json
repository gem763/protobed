The design change even required an amendment to the law to permit it.\n\nAbout 70 per cent of Netflix's films and shows have age classifications which will now have the newly-designed logos clearly displayed for parents and children.\n\nMr Perkins added: \"Parents tell us how tough it can be to navigate the online world safely, and we're here to help with that.\n\n\"We have been rating content for over 100 years, so we have a lot of experience to draw from and as the landscape of viewing content changes, so do we.\n\n\"We do large scale research every four to five years to understand what matters and how attitudes are changing, most especially for children and families.\n\n\"We\u2019re proud to be launching digital symbols for a digital audience, to help them get the information they need so they can view what's right for them.\"", "description": "Netflix is for the first time to carry official sex and violence film classifications by Britain\u2019s chief censor as research shows a third of teenagers see content every week that upsets them.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Home Affairs Editor", "Telegraph View", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/09/TELEMMGLPICT000206012106-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7N2CxnJWnYI3tCbVBgu9WVLDaeaWzlxIQpTU2T6YjQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
