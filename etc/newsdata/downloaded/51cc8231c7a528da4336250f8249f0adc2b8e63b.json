Two weeks later, the chamber revised its website to acknowledge that humans contribute to climate change and that \u201cinaction is simply not an option.\u201d\n\nBradley said that to support the business push for action on climate the chamber was supporting several bills that focus on energy innovation. These include areas such as advanced nuclear energy, capturing carbon emissions and storing them underground, and research and development for batteries to store electricity generated by wind and solar farms.\n\nThe chamber said it does not have a position on a carbon tax, in which a fee would be placed on fossil fuels, some of which would be returned to consumers and workers to deal with costs associated with transition to low-carbon energy. Versions of a carbon tax are supported by several big energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP PLC (BP.L) and Shell.\n\nA group of senior Republicans, including former secretaries of state James Baker and George Shultz, also support a carbon tax of some sort.", "description": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said on Tuesday it was forming a climate change task force to better understand how businesses are responding to the issue, backing away from the skepticism on global warming that prompted several companies to quit the group a decade ago.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433489535&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N25C", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
