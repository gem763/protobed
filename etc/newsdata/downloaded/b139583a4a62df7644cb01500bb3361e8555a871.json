Governor Phil Scott said at a press conference Thursday that he isn\u2019t surprised about the allegations against the president because he has \u201cwatched him over the years.\u201d\n\nScott is a frequent critic of Trump so maybe it should be said that this stance by Vermont\u2019s governor isn\u2019t surprising, either. He can have the satisfaction, I guess, that he\u2019s the first Republican governor to publicly support the Democrats\u2019 impeachment agenda.\n\nWhen pressed by reporters, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Wednesday he was withholding judgment. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan have yet to comment.\n\nGovernor Scott said that Congress has a \u201csolemn responsibility\u201d to pursue its role in the checks and balances in impeachment proceedings. He couched his call for starting the impeachment process by cautioning Congress that the process is serious and \u201cshould not be taken lightly or abused.\u201d To which I say, \u201cfat chance, governor.\u201d House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff began Thursday\u2019s hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire by literally making a mockery out of the transcript from the telephone call in question between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky. When he was called out on it, he called it a parody. How are House Democrats to be taken seriously when the chairman of an important committee opens with a parody instead of the actual memo, which he had in front of him?\n\nGovernor Scott is simply following along with the Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans eager to bring the impeachment circus to town. This hearing was held because of a complainant\u2019s second-hand accusations that were filed against President Trump over his behavior during a telephone conversation with a foreign leader. Scott wants to boldly go there but can\u2019t quite do it. He seems to want impeachment but is trying to show a minimum of restraint about a full-on impeachment trial in the Senate. He\u2019s encouraging the House to carry on with their show hearings and then vote for the impeachment to move forward.\n\nScott previously criticized President Trump\u2019s tweet that members of The Squad should go back to their countries. He called the remark \u201cracist\u201d and not befitting of the president.\n\nIt is interesting to hear Governor Scott temper his enthusiasm for impeachment. Thursday morning former Gov. John Kasich, a fierce Trump critic after failing to defeat him for the Republican nomination in 2016, also spoke with an abundance of caution during an interview on CNN\u2019s New Day. I watched as Kasich was careful to not say Trump was guilty of anything specifically \u2013 yet- but that the conversation is questionable and should be checked out. Alisyn Camarota did her best to get Kasich, normally only too happy to lash out against Trump, to go further but he didn\u2019t do so. Kasich even said that Speaker Pelosi \u201cmoved too fast.\u201d Again, I was surprised at his cautious approach in this interview.\n\n\"It made me sick,\" says former Ohio Gov. John Kasich about the White House transcript of the Ukraine call. But he is not yet convinced that this warrants impeachment and says that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"moved forward too fast.\"https://t.co/OK3mlXoJrW pic.twitter.com/X4eviPbfKF \u2014 New Day (@NewDay) September 26, 2019\n\nYou\u2019ll note in that clip that Kasich says he doesn\u2019t support Trump and will not support him but Democrats are operating on emotion and wanting a pound of flesh. He\u2019s right in that thought. Pelosi jumped the gun to call for impeachment inquiries to move forward before she even saw the complaint or the transcript memo. She caved to the demands of her far-left members. The \u201cDo Something\u201d chorus won this one. If today\u2019s House Intelligence hearing is any indication as to how the House proceeds moving forward, there isn\u2019t much \u201cthere\u201d there.", "description": "Conditional", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/93966f59-c13f-4c7e-a4b5-b5ceec1f28fd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
