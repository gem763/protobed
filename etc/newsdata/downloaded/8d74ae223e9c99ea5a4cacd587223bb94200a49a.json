They go against God/nature by chopping music into numbers. I\u2019m with Young 100 percent on this. Beautiful flowing music, sliced to bits! And what is the devil\u2019s price for having the entire Tangerine Dream back catalog at your fingertips? Why, shitty sound quality. The sound coming out of my Bluetooth speaker is no longer a dimension; it\u2019s a narrow pulse, a serrated wave. Bass-blurts, ragged spikes of treble, a terrible crowdedness or crammedness in the midrange. My old-fart ears are squeaking in discomfort. The acoustic environment, like every other environment, is being degraded.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be, is Young\u2019s point. We\u2019ve all settled for this, because Steve Jobs said so. (\u201c[Jobs] appreciated high-res music and listened to vinyl himself,\u201d writes Young. \u201cWhen we spoke together, he told me his customers were perfectly satisfied with MP3 quality. He had one standard for himself and another for his customers.\u201d) And so: Pono. We might think of it as a kind of organic iTunes. Higher-resolution audio, healthier music. Young spearheaded its development; he got in with heavy business people, heavy tech people. His warlord of a manager, Elliott Roberts, in what seems to me a startling act of managerial magnanimity, was right behind him. The Pono project failed, inevitably (who can beat Apple?), but somehow that is beside the point.\n\nPhil Baker, Pono\u2019s chief developer, is the co-author of To Feel the Music. The book has \u201cNeil\u201d chapters and \u201cPhil\u201d chapters. Baker writes clear and unexciting prose. \u201cI\u2019ve usually found that working with a small, smart development team is much more effective than working with a large product design organization, particularly when you can build that team with engineers matched to the exact needs of the product being developed.\u201d Indeed. Neil Young, on the other hand, writes books like he makes records with his on-off band Crazy Horse\u2014which is to say, according to a highly evolved and very disciplined aesthetic of half-assedness. Whatever comes out, comes out. The drums may sag, the jams may wander, but a zone of bristling and broadly energized possibility is created. Stylistically, To Feel the Music is a more reined-in performance than his previous books, but the old wild sloppiness pops up here and there. \u201cYou know, I may end up going to my grave and be banging my head against my gravestone trying to get somebody to understand about what\u2019s happening to music!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the summit of idleness to deplore the present,\u201d Martin Amis once wrote, \u201cto deplore actuality.\u201d But what if actuality is deplorable? Young is right about our current listening conditions\u2014more than right, he\u2019s prophetically correct\u2014and his mission to improve them, to improve us, has the nobility of true crankdom. He\u2019s certainly not making any money off it.", "description": "The musician wrote his new book, To Feel the Music, the same way he makes records\u2014according to a highly evolved aesthetic of half-assedness.", "authors": ["James Parker", "Neil Young", "Phil Baker"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/ToFeeltheMusic_FrontCover/facebook.jpg?1569621943", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
