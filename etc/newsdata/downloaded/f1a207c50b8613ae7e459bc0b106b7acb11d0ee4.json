I\u2019m not piling on Mulvaney, I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s helpful,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cBut when you have a legal issue before a lot of people who aren\u2019t lawyers, the last thing you want to do is try to get out there and say a whole bunch of things really fast and then say, \u2018Well, the context was,\u2019 going back, and the reach back was\u2014and then there\u2019s not enough of a pause between one thought and another, and then they could say, \u2018Aha, see, see, you did,\u2019 and then have to go back and clean it up afterward.\u201d\n\nShe went on to note that Mulvaney tried to walk back his comments later in the day, reading aloud his entire statement before adding: \u201cYou never want to have to come back and clarify, it happens, especially when you\u2019re not used to doing these things on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nMulvaney, meanwhile, graduated from the law school at the University of North Carolina in 1992 and spent the next five years practicing law with the firm James, McElroy & Diehl.\n\nWhile Ingraham appeared to not realize that Mulvaney actually is a lawyer who once worked for a firm, at least she didn\u2019t call him \u201cdumb.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
