She was 84.\n\nCarroll\u2019s daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer.\n\nDuring her long career, Carroll earned a Tony Award for the musical \u201cNo Strings\u201d and an Academy Award nomination for \u201cClaudine.\u201d\n\nBut she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on \u201cJulia.\u201d Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.\n\nAlthough she was not the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series \u201cBeulah\u201d), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant.\n\nNBC executives were wary about putting \u201cJulia\u201d on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.\n\nIt had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll\u2019s character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cThey said it was a fantasy,\u201d Carroll recalled in 1998. \u201cAll of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family.\u201d\n\nNot shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical \u201cNo Strings.\u201d Critic Walter Kerr described her as \u201ca girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin.\u201d\n\nShe appeared often in plays previously considered exclusive territory for white actresses: \u201cSame Time, Next Year,\u201d \u201dAgnes of God\u201d and \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d (as faded star Norma Desmond, the role played by Gloria Swanson in the 1950 film.)\n\n\u201cI like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn\u2019t my original intention,\u201d she said in 2002.\n\nHer film career was sporadic. She began with a secondary role in \u201cCarmen Jones\u201d in 1954 and five years later appeared in \u201cPorgy and Bess,\u201d although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn\u2019t considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera. Her other films included \u201cGoodbye Again,\u201d \u201dHurry Sundown,\u201d \u201dParis Blues,\u201d and \u201cThe Split.\u201d\n\nThe 1974 film \u201cClaudine\u201d provided her most memorable role. She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones.\n\nIn the 1980s, she appeared in the long-running prime-time soap opera \u201cDynasty\u201d for three years. More recently, she had a number of guest shots and small roles in TV series, including playing the mother of Isaiah Washington\u2019s character, Dr. Preston Burke, on \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d\n\nShe also returned to her roots in nightclubs. In 2006, she made her first club appearance in New York in four decades, singing at Feinstein\u2019s at the Regency. Reviewing a return engagement in 2007, a New York Times critic wrote that she sang \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d with \u201cthe reflective tone of a woman who has survived many severe storms and remembers every lightning flash and thunderclap.\u201d\n\nCarol Diann Johnson was born in New York City and attended the High School for the Performing Arts. Her father was a subway conductor and her mother a homemaker.\n\nShe began her career as a model, but a prize from \u201cArthur Godfrey\u2019s Talent Scouts\u201d TV show led to nightclub engagements.\n\nIn her 1998 memoir \u201cDiahann,\u201d Carroll traced her turbulent romantic life, which included liaisons with Harry Belafonte, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr., Sidney Poitier and David Frost. She even became engaged to Frost, but the engagement was canceled.\n\nAn early marriage to nightclub owner Monte Kay resulted in Carroll\u2019s only child, Suzanne, as well as a divorce. She also divorced her second husband, retail executive Freddie Glusman, later marrying magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who died.\n\nHer most celebrated marriage was in 1987, to singer Vic Damone, and the two appeared together in nightclubs. But they separated in 1991 and divorced several years later.\n\nAfter she was treated for breast cancer in 1998, she spoke out for more money for research and for free screening for women who couldn\u2019t afford mammograms.\n\n\u201cWe all look forward to the day that mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiation are considered barbaric,\u201d Carroll told a gathering in 2000.\n\n___\n\nBob Thomas, a long-time and now deceased staffer of the Associated Press, was the principal writer of this obituary.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series as \"Julia,\" has died.
