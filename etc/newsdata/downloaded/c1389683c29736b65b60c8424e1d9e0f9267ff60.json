The Cubs say they will know more about when he might be able to return at that point.\n\nThe loss of Rizzo is another big blow for Chicago, which already was playing without Javier B\u00e1ez after the All-Star shortstop broke his left thumb. Closer Craig Kimbrel has been sidelined by right elbow inflammation, but he is scheduled to throw a simulated game Tuesday and could return this weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo will wear a walking boot for the next five to seven days after an MRI showed he had a moderate lateral right ankle sprain.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jay Cohen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/pirates_cubs_baseball_73518_c0-118-2814-1758_s1770x1032.jpg?726ffb50cf34401b768b2f62da2bdef97cbc891c", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
