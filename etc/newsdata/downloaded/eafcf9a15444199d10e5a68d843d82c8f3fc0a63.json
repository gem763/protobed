They do not scare Iraqis. This will all come down over their heads,\u201d said one protester in the capital.\n\nAt least 4,000 protesters gathered in Baghdad\u2019s Tayaran Square and attempted to march onto the central Tahrir Square but were met with open fire and heavy tear gas.\n\nPolice used live ammunition in the Zaafaraniya district of Baghdad, where three protesters were shot dead, and there were protests in the northwestern Shula district.\n\nPolice said protesters had fired at them in the town of Rifae near the southern city of Nassiriya where seven people were killed overnight and another on Thursday. Fifty people were wounded in Rifae, including five police, they said.\n\nFour people were killed in clashes overnight in another southern city, Amara.\n\nAmnesty International called on Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government to rein in the security forces and investigate the killings.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous that Iraqi security forces time and again deal with protesters with such brutality using lethal and unnecessary force. It is crucial that the authorities ensure a fully independent and impartial investigation,\u201d said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East Research Director.\n\nThe United Nations urged the government to \u201cexercise maximum restraint\u201d and allow peaceful protests.\n\n\u2018LIVE GUNFIRE\u2019\n\nA curfew, lifted early in the morning in southern cities, was reimposed immediately in Nassiriya and later in Amara. Curfews have also been declared in the Shi\u2019ite holy city of Najaf and in Hilla.\n\nIn Baghdad, the authorities attempted to head off protests by imposing a curfew from 5 a.m. Troops patrolled main roads and public spaces, but by morning sporadic demonstrations had begun, and troops opened fire with live rounds to disperse them.\n\nDemonstrators gather at a protest during a curfew, two days after the nationwide anti-government protests turned violent, in Baghdad, Iraq October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani\n\nResidents of the capital queued outside supermarkets and food stores to stock up on supplies in case of a sudden rise in prices or further security restrictions by authorities.\n\nIraq has struggled to recover since defeating the Sunni Muslim hardline Islamic State group in 2017. Its infrastructure has been laid to waste by decades of sectarian civil war, foreign occupation, two U.S. invasions, U.N. sanctions and war against its neighbours.\n\nWith the country at last at peace and free to trade, many Iraqis say their government has failed to rebuild the nation.\n\nThe demonstrations began in Baghdad on Tuesday and quickly grew and spread to other cities, mainly in Iraq\u2019s south. Police have fired live rounds, tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters.\n\nProtesters directed their anger at a government and political class they say is corrupt and doing nothing to improve their lives.\n\n\u201cThe people are being robbed. The people are now begging on the street. There is no work, you come to protest, they fire at you. Live gunfire,\u201d said a man covering his face in a scarf.\n\nIraq has the world\u2019s fourth-largest reserves of oil, according to the International Monetary Fund, but much of its population of 40 million lives in poverty and without decent healthcare, education or power and water supply.\n\nPILGRIMAGE\n\nThe violence began just days before the Shi\u2019ite pilgrimage of Arbaeen, when about 20 million worshippers are expected to journey across southern Iraq on foot for days in the largest annual gathering in the world.\n\nThe Iraqi unrest forced neighbouring Iran to shut one of the major border crossings used by pilgrims.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nAnti-government demonstrations last year that began in oil-rich Basra prompted a heavy crackdown by security forces and nearly 30 people were killed.\n\nPrime Minister Abdul Mahdi chaired an emergency national security council meeting and ordered Thursday\u2019s curfew in Baghdad. Only travellers to and from the airport, ambulances, some government employees and religious pilgrims were to be allowed on the streets.\n\nHe visited the Baghdad Operations Command on Thursday with the defence and interior ministers, state television reported.\n\nSeparately, police and medical sources said a couple who had been involved in the Basra protests last year were shot dead in their home late on Wednesday. Security sources said they had received threats from powerful militia groups in Basra last year.", "description": "Iraqi security forces opened fire on thousands of demonstrators who defied a curfew in Baghdad on Thursday and exchanged fire with gunmen in southern cities, bringing to 27 the death toll from three days of anti-government protests.", "authors": ["Ahmed Rasheed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436754330&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921M0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
