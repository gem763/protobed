For too long, environmental damage has been seen as a \"victimless\" offense, activists say. But hundreds of millions of people around the world are currently contending with the very real consequences of fracking, deforestation and unchecked pollution.\n\n\n\nIndividuals and corporations should be held criminally accountable for the damage wrought by these practices, argue scientists and climate change experts. Critics however point out that it's difficult to determine who exactly is responsible for environmental disasters, and if harm was intended by the guilty party. Some judges add that courts should not be legislating climate policy.\n\n\n\nThat said, more than 1,300 test cases in 28 countries are already working their way through the courts. In the US for example, students are suing the government for risking their futures by contributing to global warming. The fossil fuel industry is also facing lawsuits for allegedly defrauding the public through misinformation campaigns about climate change.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, Colombia's Supreme Court recently granted environmental personhood status to the country's Amazon. And in the coming months, the International Criminal Court could ratify a law that renders large-scale destruction of the natural living world illegal.\n\n\n\nWe ask, should damaging the environment be considered a crime against humanity?\n\n\n\nOn this episode of The Stream, we speak with:\n\n\n\nJojo Mehta @Jojo_Mehta\n\nDirector, Ecological Defence Integrity & Co-Founder, Stop Ecocide Campaign\n\nstopecocide.earth\n\n\n\nKetan Jha @PlanB_Earth\n\nLecturer in Law, University of Brighton\n\nplanb.earth\n\n\n\nManipadma Jena @ManipadmaJena\n\nJournalist\n\nmanipadmajena.com\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nOutlawing \u2018ecocide\u2019: The battle to make a crime of environmental destruction - CommonSpace\n\nThe climate change lawsuit that could stop the U.S. government from supporting fossil fuels \u2013 60 Minutes\n\nKeep courts off of the climate policy playground \u2013 The Hill\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
