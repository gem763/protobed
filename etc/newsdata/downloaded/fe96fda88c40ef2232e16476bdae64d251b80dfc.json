They need to do the dirty things in the game better: second balls, stopping crosses, winning headers.\n\n\u2018You have to battle as hard as you can. If you don\u2019t turn up, like the first half, you get beat.\u2019\n\nDaniel Drowley holds his head in his hands after Daniel Ayala's 87th-minute equaliser\n\nBirmingham caretaker manager Pep Clotet said: \u2018We went for a second goal and I like that mentality, we always chase the second goal and the result is fair.\u2019\n\nClotet was especially heartened by the performance of his young players Bailey, Villalba and Jude Bellingham: \u2018We like the talent and courage they have and they are 100 per cent the future of this club. We ensure the fans have someone there who is homegrown.\u2019\n\nAfter three defeats on the spin, the Blues started with the intensity of a team looking to redeem themselves and prove a few points.\n\nThey dominated the first-half from first whistle to last, scoring once when they realistically should have gone in four or five goals ahead.\n\nClotet had evidently done his homework, with Birmingham relentlessly probing away at two pre-identified Boro areas of weakness.\n\nLukas Jutkiewicz grabs Fran Villalba after the Spaniard opens the scoring at St Andrew's\n\nOne was Ryan Shotton on the left side of Boro\u2019s defence because his poor positioning meant he was repeatedly beaten by his opposite number Maxime Colin, whose low crossing posed a continual threat.\n\nThe other was a perceived lack of authority in the air, something tested time after time by Villalba\u2019s corner kicks, which were always swung in right on top of keeper Darren Randolph, and the catapult long throws of Marc Roberts.\n\nIndeed, had it not been for the reflexes of Randolph, the Teessiders would have been dead and buried well before half-time.\n\nHis best save came three minutes in. Colin surged forward down Birmingham\u2019s right for the first of many times and his cross flicked Shotton\u2019s heel to fall perfectly the Villalba about 12 yards out.\n\nThe former Valencia man strokes towards the bottom corner and beyond Darren Randolph\n\nThe Spaniard couldn\u2019t have struck his half-volley any sweeter but somehow Randolph reacted to deflect it over the bar.\n\nBirmingham attacked again and again, almost always down the right, with Roberts knocking down a cross onto Dael Fry, who needed Randolph to spare his blushes with a touch over the top.\n\nGiven their control of proceedings, the breakthrough became inevitable even for a Birmingham team who have struggled for goals in the early weeks.\n\nIt duly arrived on 33 minutes when Villalba spotted that Shotton had afforded Colin acres of space and picked him out. Colin had plenty of time to assess options and his low cut-back found Villalba, who\u2019d continued motoring into the box.\n\nRandolph makes a great save after defender Dael Fry deflected towards his own goal\n\nThe Spaniard swept home a low near post shot that was even too good for Randolph to open his scoring account for Birmingham after arriving from Valencia in the summer.\n\nBoro spent the closing minutes of the half on the ropes, with Randolph turning a Kristian Pedersen header over the bar before almost being caught out by Harlee Dean\u2019s headed effort.\n\nAnd in first-half stoppage time, Villalba\u2019s corner caused panic and Pedersen\u2019s close-range header rattled the underside of the bar before being cleared.\n\nBoro had been outplayed, barely posing any threat going forward and their one chance of the half came from a set-piece by Marcus Tavernier that Lee Camp pushed around the post.\n\nBirmingham defender Maxime Colin battles for the ball with Boro's Marcus Tavernier\n\nThere was a little more urgency about Boro after the break but the chances continued to fall the way of the home side, with Villalba curling a shot wide.\n\nBelatedly, Boro did start to conjure a mild attacking threat and Camp clawed away a Paddy McNair cross that spooned across the six-yard box.\n\nBut Birmingham should have scored when substitute Gary Gardner struck the post late on after Jacques Mahoma\u2019s effort was blocked, before Ivan Sunjic shot wide.\n\nThat would have spared us the dramatic finale but justice was served in the end.", "description": "ADAM SHERGOLD AT ST ANDREW'S: Teenager Odin Bailey picked the perfect moment to score his first senior goal and earn Birmingham a thoroughly deserved victory.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/21/19315098-0-image-a-35_1570222266095.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
