The home originally hit the market over the summer asking a hair under $40 million.\n\n\n\nThe renowned supermodel and her NFL quarterback husband tapped prolific celebrity architect Richard Landry to design the nearly 10,000-square-foot red-brick house in Brookline, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nMore: RuPaul Scores Glamorous Chateau in Beverly Hills\n\nIncorporating New England vernacular architecture, the house was completed in 2015 and boasts warm, modern interiors with rustic details like painted brick and exposed ceiling beams.\n\n\n\nIn total, the mansion includes five bedrooms, a wine room, a gym and a spa.\n\n\n\nOutside, sprawling lawns encompass the family\u2019s vegetable garden and a barn-style guest house\u2014with nearly enough square footage to fill a tennis court\u2014including a yoga room and sleeping loft.\n\n\n\nThe couple picked up the secluded slice of Boston real estate in 2013, when they bought a chunk of land from Pine Manor College for $4.5 million, according to county property records. Mr. Brady, 42, and Ms. B\u00fcndchen, 39, purchased the land through a limited liability company tied to Mr. Brady\u2019s business manager.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Airbus Ruling Will Push Imported Wine and Cheese Prices Higher\n\nWhen the home first listed in August, the New York Post reported that the power couple were looking to move closer to New York City as Mr. Brady prepares for his post-football career.
