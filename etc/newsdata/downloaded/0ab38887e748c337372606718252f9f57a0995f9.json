British domestic politics can be unforgiving, as Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May learned after making a deal with Brussels only to have it defeated three times in Parliament.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Johnson\u2019s official spokesman told reporters, \u201cissues remain to be resolved.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told Sky News he had spoken with Johnson on Wednesday and that a delay \u2014 and another E.U. summit later this month \u2014 might be needed.\n\nAD\n\nA senior European diplomat in Brussels told The Washington Post, \u201cthere are these high expectations that a deal can be made, that we can make it, but of course the timing is crucial.\u201d\n\nIn a series of briefings, European diplomats said that any deal in principle must be put into detailed legal text, then translated, then briefed to European leaders in time for an E.U. summit that begins on Thursday.\n\nA number of diplomats said there just did not appear to be enough time so an extension \u2014 even with a rough deal in the works \u2014 emerged as a leading option.\n\nThe Europeans don\u2019t want to actually negotiate the details at the summit. \u201cNo appetite\u201d for that, said one senior diplomat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe key sticking point in the closed-door talks in Brussels was the future of Northern Ireland, which will depart the E.U. along with the rest of the United Kingdom. Both the U.K. and the E.U. say they want to keep open the border with the Republic of Ireland, to preserve the hard-won peace there. They have disagreed about how to achieve that, with the E.U. saying Northern Ireland would have to remain tightly aligned with its own rules.\n\nMay had said \u201cno U.K. prime minister would ever agree to\u201d a proposal that would create a customs border in the Irish Sea. And Johnson had resisted the idea. But on Tuesday, he seemed to be moving far closer to European demands in a bid to push the talks to a conclusion.\n\nE.U. leaders will meet in Brussels Thursday and Friday, when they will either sign off on a deal, agree to delay the Brexit date beyond October or brace for a sudden and uncontrolled British departure from the bloc.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven if the agreement will be difficult, more and more difficult, to be frank, it is still possible this week,\u201d chief E.U. Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier told reporters ahead of the marathon negotiations.\n\nOne European diplomat involved in the negotiations said late Tuesday that \u201cthere is light in the tunnel, but for the moment it comes from only neon tubes, not from the exit.\u201d The diplomat spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks.\n\nThe Irish border has proved to be one of the most vexing issues facing negotiators over the past three years. The promise of an open border is central to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Troubles, as the 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland are known.\n\nAD\n\nToday the boundary is mostly invisible. A driver whizzing between Belfast and Dublin is not required to stop for any customs check or security control. There are no tollbooths, no cameras, not even a signpost. Brexit could change all that. If the United Kingdom has its own set of tariffs and regulations, Europeans would demand a customs border to prevent smuggling and ensure the integrity of their own internal market.\n\nAD\n\nBut both sides fear it could lead to violence.\n\nWhile the sweeping, E.U. bureaucratic hub of the Berlaymont building in Brussels was busy with Brexit talks, so too was Johnson\u2019s official residence at 10 Downing Street, where ministers and lawmakers dashed in and out all day Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nBy some counts, compared to May, Johnson would face an even tougher vote in the House of Commons. His Conservative Party no longer holds a majority, and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has warned that his Labour Party will not support Johnson\u2019s \u201cTory Brexit,\u201d no matter the details (though some Labour rebels have signaled they might just back a deal).\n\nThe most hard-line Brexiteers, known as the \u201cSpartans,\u201d may also rise up against any deal that crosses their red lines.\n\nBut there were signals that the Tories might rally behind their new prime minister.\n\nAD\n\nSteve Baker, leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), left a meeting Tuesday at 10 Downing Street telling reporters outside that he was \u201coptimistic that it is possible to reach a tolerable deal that I am able to vote for.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe former leader of the ERG and now leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, pleaded with fellow Conservatives to trust Johnson because \u2014 unlike May \u2014 he is a true Brexiteer, a leader of the winning June 2016 campaign to leave the European Union.\n\nRees-Mogg said Parliament was desperate for a deal.\n\nEven tougher for Johnson and any deal he crafts are the 10 lawmakers from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) from Northern Ireland, who have opposed any kind of Brexit deal that would see the Irish province treated differently than England, Wales and Scotland, their fellow nations in the U.K.\n\nAD\n\nArlene Foster, the DUP leader, visited Johnson again on Tuesday night, and before entering 10 Downing promised she would \u201cdo what\u2019s best for the union.\u201d", "description": "With the hours ticking away until E.U. leaders meet this week, Britain is making concessions.", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe", "William Booth", "London Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GuxwYVQb8gKYnnf8-X8Dcqq6u4s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G6QCDXXQBMI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
