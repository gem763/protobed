Those outlets, The Washington Post and The New York Times, did not go much further than those details. But earlier reports said that what prompted the whistleblower to come forward was a pledge made by Trump to a foreign leader.\n\nThe complaint was explosive enough to prompt the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general to bring it to the attention of the director of national intelligence, who has not made it available to Congress in part because of objections from the Department of Justice.\n\nAndrew Bakaj, a former CIA officer and managing partner at the Compass Ross Legal Group who is representing the whistleblower, declined to comment for this story. But the revelation of Ukraine\u2019s involvement is a tantalizing clue about just how sensitive the matter may be. That\u2019s because Ukraine has been at the epicenter of the president and his team\u2019s efforts to damage their most likely general election opponent: former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nShortly after his election, Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and his team found themselves being pressured by Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer and confidant, to further an investigation into whether Biden may or may not have applied pressure to curtail an investigation into his son Hunter\u2019s role on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nGiuliani has said he was also inquiring about matters related to the 2016 election and attempts to dig up dirt on Trump\u2019s former aide, Paul Manafort. He also has defended his desire to dig up dirt on Biden and his willingness to work with foreign sources to do so.\n\nA source with direct knowledge of the situation says that in recent months he has informally advised Trump on how to approach Zelensky. That advice came around the time rumors started flying that the president was withholding aid to the Ukrainian government until he received assurances the Biden investigation would move forward.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a question mark, there are a lot of good things, but there are these people he surrounds himself with,\u201d Giuliani said of Zelensky in a conversation with The Daily Beast in late July. \u201cHe\u2019s been there too short a period of time to know how he\u2019s going to act. But I think there are very good signs and I have an open mind.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday evening, when asked about the latest Ukraine revelation and if it was related to his well-publicized efforts, Giuliani simply said, \u201cDon\u2019t know and don\u2019t care. Let them [the Democrats] knock themselves out.\u201d Asked whether anybody had been in touch with him yet about the whistleblower complaint, the Trump attorney responded, \u201cNo, it\u2019s total bull[shit].\u201d He then claimed that \u201cBiden did bribery, and you don\u2019t cover it. I did my job as a good lawyer [for President Trump] and Corrupt Media gets excited.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration ultimately did sign off on a major military aid package, releasing it on Sept. 12. Zelensky spoke to Trump in late July. The readout of that call from the Ukrainian camp reportedly noted that Trump was focused on Ukraine\u2019s ability to \u201ccomplete investigations into corruption cases that have hampered Ukraine-US cooperation.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview with CNN on Thursday night, Giuliani said he believed it was \u201cperfectly appropriate\u201d for a president to ask a leader of a foreign country to investigate allegations of corruption, even those involving political leaders from another party. He also said Trump has a right to withhold aid to a country until it cleans up corruption.\n\nBiden\u2019s presidential campaign declined a request for comment. Michael Carpenter, who served in the White House as a foreign policy adviser to Biden, said: \u201cIf President Trump promised President Zelensky security assistance as a quid pro quo for launching politically motivated investigations against his 2020 presidential opponents, that would constitute a clear abuse of office by the president. At this point, however, we don\u2019t know all the facts, which is precisely why Congress needs to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nZelensky did meet with Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) on Sept. 5. In a briefing with reporters five days later, the Senator said he had encouraged him to not respond to requests made from political actors in the United States, that \u201cit was much better for the President to rebuff any pressure he's getting from political campaigns in the United States to conduct investigations.\u201d Zelensky, Murphy recounted, \u201cwas ready for that question, you know, he wasn't surprised that I brought it up. And his response was pretty simple that they have no intention of getting involved in an American election.\u201d\n\nAs The Daily Beast first reported in June, House Democrats had been looking for months to open a probe into Giuliani for his overseas political and consulting work, including his efforts to uncover dirt on Biden. And it could very well be that the whistleblower complaint adds fuel to those investigations, though so far lawmakers on the Hill seem to be as in the dark about the matter as the public itself.\n\nOn Thursday, the IC\u2019s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, held a four-hour closed-door briefing with members of the House Intelligence Committee. Members were tight-lipped over any details of the exchanges, save to say that Atkinson conducted the briefing in a hearing-like fashion, speaking for a length of time at the beginning before answering questions from the ranking chairs of the committee.\n\nOverall, members said they left the briefing with the clear impression that the complaint raised grave concerns about U.S. national security interests and needed immediate attention. Days earlier, Atkinson had written a letter to committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) saying the complaint related to \u201cone of the most significant and important of the DNI\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\u201d\n\nAfter the conclusion of the briefing Thursday afternoon, though, it was clear that the most burning questions members had about the complaint\u2014and the process by which the committee learned of it\u2014had gone unanswered.\n\n\u201cWe knew going in he wasn\u2019t going to talk about the complaint,\u201d said Rep. Mike Quigley (D-IL). \u201cNo matter how clever you are, you aren\u2019t going to find out more about it.\u201d\n\nLawyers and former national security officials who spoke to The Daily Beast on Thursday said the complaint would have to have a clear connection to distinct intelligence operations or processes in order to be filed with the director of national intelligence.\n\nIn the absence of specific details about the complaint, lawmakers focused on process\u2014and the possibility that actors in the administration are actively working to ensure Congress does not learn more about the complaint. After the hearing ended, Schiff released letters sent from the IG to his committee, in which the IG wrote that Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire had not authorized him to say anything about the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, \u201caffecting the execution of two of my most important duties and responsibilities,\u201d in Atkinson\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cI have requested authorization from the Acting DNI to disclose, at the very least, the general subject matter of the Complainant\u2019s allegations to the congressional intelligence committees,\u201d Atkinson told lawmakers in a letter dated Sept. 17. He also divulged that the DNI office consulted with the Department of Justice, which advised that the DNI had no obligation under the law to disclose information about the whistleblower to Congress.\n\nWhile Schiff held forth in front of reporters at the end of the four-hour hearing, the top Republican on the committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), has yet to weigh in publicly. Since the first Washington Post story on the nature of the complaint was published, some GOP lawmakers voiced a concern that the press had become an avenue for advancing the whistleblower\u2019s story. Appearing Thursday morning on C-SPAN, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) suggested the story might be fake, citing a much-criticized recent New York Times report on Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nAsked about his sense of the situation on Thursday afternoon, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX), an Intelligence Committee member, said he couldn\u2019t divulge much\u2014but affirmed that Republicans on the committee were taking it seriously.", "description": "Two reports on Thursday night say the conversation in the complaint involved Ukraine, the country that the president\u2019s close lawyer has turned to looking for dirt on Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Erin Banco", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Sam Stein", "Congressional Reporter", "National Security Reporter", "White House Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568944675/190920-brodey-trump-whistleblower-promise-hero_fpgvoq", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
