Now, hardly a decade later, we're talking about a peak two orders of magnitude greater,\" Karon said.\n\nHowever, since 2008, Akamai's traffic didn't grow at a slow pace towards the 106 Tbps peak observed last week. It exploded during the past year, primarily driven by the online video game industry, and specifically, Fortnite.\n\nIn fact, this is the third time in Akamai's recent history that a Fortnite update shattered its previous CDN traffic record.\n\nThe same thing happened in July and December 2018, when Akamai's CDN peaked at 37 Tbps and then at 75 Tbps, both caused by a new Fortnite release at the time.\n\nAkamai wasn't the only CDN that saw these traffic peaks last week. An industry source told ZDNet that similar huge traffic spikes happen at all the other CDNs Epic Games is using to get Fortnite updates to its users, although, we don't have the exact numbers for each.\n\nThe company, which provides a wide array of services outside its CDN offering, is expected to release its Q3 earnings next Monday, October 28.\n\nAccording to a NASDAQ report, for third-quarter 2019, Akamai anticipates revenues between $692 million and $706 million, above previous estimates.", "description": "Akamai said CDN traffic peaked at 106 Tbps last week, passing the 100 Tbps mark for the first time.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/09/8c4c16ad-42dc-4a9f-995c-dae2c075f512/thumbnail/770x578/9cf053cb8fc5dd9f05ca56c36cb71101/fortnite-gamer-11333328.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
