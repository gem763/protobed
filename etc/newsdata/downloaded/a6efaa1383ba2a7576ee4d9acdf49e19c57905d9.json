Andy Dalton got sacked a career-high eight times - he barely had time to retreat from center on some plays - and the defense couldn\u2019t stop a pared-down passing game in Pittsburgh\u2019s 27-3 victory.\n\nFor the 0-4 Bengals, it\u2019s bad enough that September has come and gone without a win. The way they lost their latest one, however, eliminated any thoughts of an about-face under first year coach Zac Taylor.\n\n\u201cIt was just awful overall,\u201d receiver Tyler Boyd said.\n\nAnd in the worst possible setting - a prime-time stage.\n\nThe Bengals fell to 6-16 in prime-time games since 2011, when Dalton was a rookie, including 2-6 on Monday night. They\u2019ve now lost nine in a row and 12 of 13 against the Steelers, including that 18-16 playoff meltdown at Paul Brown Stadium that ended their 2015 season - their last one with a winning record.\n\nThe sight of Dalton getting swamped in the backfield was reminiscent of David Klingler getting sacked 10 times by the Steelers in 1992. Dalton was 21 of 37 for 171 yards with an interception in the end zone , a fumble on a sack, and 69 yards lost on those eight sacks. For perspective, the Bengals rushed for only 73 yards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out who we are,\u201d Dalton said.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nAbsolutely nothing. In addition to the horrid offense, the defense allowed Mason Rudolph to complete 24 of 28 for 229 yards and two touchdowns in a dump-it-off approach that Cincinnati couldn\u2019t stop. Also, there was another egregious coverage breakdown that left Diontae Johnson open for a 43-yard touchdown catch.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe offensive line took many steps backward in Pittsburgh, repeatedly beaten one-on-one . Guard Alex Redmond returns this week on a roster exemption after serving a four-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s policy on performance-enhancers. The Bengals also are hoping to get left tackle Cordy Glenn back soon - he sat out all four games with a concussion. But there\u2019s no quick fix to the biggest problem.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nFew players had positive performances. Linebacker Nick Vigil led with 11 tackles, two of them for losses, and caused the fumble that set up the Bengals\u2019 field goal.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nTaylor brought some fresh air to Paul Brown Stadium when he replaced Marvin Lewis, who was 0-7 in the playoffs during 16 seasons. The Bengals hoped that fans who had given up on the team would reconsider, but Taylor\u2019s energy and new offensive system haven\u2019t made a dent in the franchise\u2019s history of futility. Another lopsided loss to the Steelers drove home the point that in Cincinnati, it\u2019s always much bigger than the head coach.\n\nINJURED\n\nReceiver John Ross III landed hard on his right shoulder and left the game. It\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll be sidelined by the injury. Receiver A.J. Green\u2019s status remains uncertain as he recovers from an ankle injury during training camp.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n9 - The number of times that the Bengals have allowed at least eight sacks in a game. Four of those games came against the Steelers. Klingler\u2019s 10 sacks tied the club record during a 21-9 loss to the Steelers in 1992. Jeff Blake also was sacked 10 times in Pittsburgh in 1996.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nSomehow get a win. The Bengals host another winless team, the 0-3-1 Cardinals, on Sunday, which represents their best chance for a while. Green\u2019s return will provide a boost, whenever that happens. They\u2019re 0-4 for the 11th time in franchise history and the eighth time in the past 29 years.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Well, that was awfully familiar.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Kay"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/bengals_steelers_football_06720_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
