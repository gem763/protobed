Judging from his detractors, it seems his remarks landed heaviest on those mystified by the idea of religious neutrality.\n\nBarr began his remarks by noting that his office not only defends the free exercise of religion, but also guards against \u201cstates misapplying the Establishment Clause in a way that discriminates against people of faith.\u201d\n\nHe invoked the words of the Founding Fathers to demonstrate that the authors of the Constitution believed that a moral standard was essential to the success of a self-governed people. Indeed, the Framers feared the loss of a common moral restraint on human will.\n\nAG BARR BLASTS 'MILITANT SECULARISTS' IN SPEECH ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\nOr, as Barr put it: \u201cNo society can exist without some means for restraining individual rapacity.\u201d\n\nAbandon a common moral restraint and a formerly self-governed people will turn to either tyranny to forcefully apply such restraints, or licentiousness to unbridle any restraint in pursuit of individualism. Thus Barr laments the modern replacement of the Judeo-Christian moral system with an activated secular creed.\n\nPaul Krugman lambasted Barr in The New York Times for even giving the speech, noting that Barr sounded \u201cremarkably like America\u2019s most unhinged religious zealots\u201d who commit \u201cmass murder because schools teach the theory of evolution.\u201d\n\nIt is \u201cnot decay\u201d that plagues our modern society, Barr argued, but \u201corganized destruction.\u201d\n\n\"Secularists and their allies among the \u2018progressives,\u2019 have marshaled all the force\u201d of the modern era \u201cin an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values,\u201d he said.\n\nSo much so, Barr observed, that this \u201csecular project has itself become a religion,\u201d with all the zeal and accouterments of religion, \u201cincluding inquisitions and excommunication.\u201d\n\nThus Barr laments the modern replacement of the Judeo-Christian moral system with an activated secular creed.\n\nWhile the conscientiously defiant may not burn at the stake, today\u2019s high commissions for non-discrimination fine them, gag their speech or threaten their professional existence.\n\nWhereas the First Amendment welcomes all forms of speech, encouraging better speech to counter disagreeable speech, \u201cmilitant secularists today do not have a live-and-let-live spirit,\u201d Barr said.\n\nNot surprisingly, the speech was too much for progressive defenders of secularism.\n\nJeffrey Toobin in The New Yorker bluntly described it as \u201cthe worst speech by an Attorney General of the United States in modern history.\u201d Catherine Rampell called it \u201ca tacit endorsement of theocracy\u201d in The Washington Post.\n\nPaul Krugman lambasted Barr in The New York Times for even giving the speech, noting that Barr sounded \u201cremarkably like America\u2019s most unhinged religious zealots\u201d who commit \u201cmass murder because schools teach the theory of evolution.\u201d\n\nEvidently, Krugman believes gangs of anti-evolutionists led by Barr roam the country, chanting the mantra \u201cGuns don\u2019t kill people \u2014 Darwin kills people!\u201d\n\nBarr\u2019s critics prefer secularized neutrality, which isn\u2019t neutral at all.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nModern activists \u2014 who Barr calls \u201cmilitant secularists\u201d \u2014 are hell-bent on demanding the redefinition of the term to one in which neutrality may only be achieved through forced secularity.\n\nHence, Barr says, \u201cThe problem is not that religion is being forced on others. The problem is that irreligion and secular values are being forced on people of faith.\u201d\n\nIt is indisputable that Judeo-Christian values played a significant role in the founding of this nation.\n\nFrom pilgrims fleeing religious oppression in Europe to James Madison\u2019s outrage over Anglican Virginia jailing Baptist ministers, America\u2019s founding era is replete with efforts to preserve space for people of faith to be people of faith independent of the government\u2019s preferred religion. Such historic toleration is what should rightly be called \u201cneutrality.\u201d\n\nYet in the march to secularized neutrality, government agencies force Aaron and Melissa Klein in Oregon to speak a government-approved message or lose their business, Dr. Eric Walsh in Georgia must shed his religiosity in order to qualify for employment, and Christian schools are denied the use of the public loudspeaker to pray before kickoff.\n\nCritics of Barr\u2019s speech would do well to remember the past administration\u2019s efforts to force celibate nuns to purchase birth control. Forced conformance to the government\u2019s ideological position abandons any mask of neutrality.\n\nFiring someone from their government job for something said as a lay minister is hostility toward religion, not neutral toleration of it. Preventing Cambridge Christian School in Tampa, Fla., from pre-football game prayer censors religious speech in preference to government-imposed silence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite their protestations, militant secularists have convinced themselves that forced secularization is the only path to enlightened neutrality. It is not. The genius of the Constitution \u2014 what Barr called a \u201cquantum leap in liberty\u201d \u2014 is that it guards against hostility masquerading as neutrality.\n\nIf anything, Barr\u2019s speech is a critical call for a return to a time when notions of free speech and religious liberty were embraced by the religious and secular alike in pursuit of freedom.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JEREMY DYS", "description": "The left's attack on Attorney General William Barr for his speech defending religious liberties at Notre Dame proves he's right.", "authors": ["Jeremy Dys", "Jeremy Dys Is Deputy General Counsel For First Liberty Institute", "A Nonprofit Law Firm Dedicated To Defending Religious Freedom For All.
