If the devices aren\u2019t removed from the streets, they could potentially be picked up by hurricane winds \u2014 transforming into threats to people and property.\n\nMiami has demanded that all of these mobility companies remove their products from the streets by noon on Friday, Bloomberg reported, and both Fort Lauderdale and Orlando tell The Verge they\u2019re already removing scooters and/or bikes from their streets. Fort Lauderdale says it expects to be done by Friday at midnight. Tampa has not yet issued a request for removal, but if (or when) it does, the companies will have 12 hours to comply with it. \u201cAll of our vendors appear prepared for that requirement, and are staying tuned to the weather notices,\u201d says a spokesperson for the city of Tampa.\n\nIf the devices aren\u2019t removed from the streets, they could potentially be picked up by hurricane winds\n\nIn total, Lime has about 1500 e-scooters in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa, as well as about 500 bikes in Orlando. A ground team is collecting the scooters and bikes to store them in a warehouse while the storm passes, a spokesperson said. Lime will meet Miami\u2019s noon deadline, and plans to have its bikes removed from Orlando by mid-day Saturday. Orlando plans to have all bikes removed by Sunday, a spokesperson tells The Verge.\n\nLime, Uber\u2019s scooter company Jump, Bird and Spin all say they are prepared to batten down the hatches in all the cities in which they operate.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Lime\u2019s first hurricane; in August 2017, Lime pulled their bike fleet for Hurricane Irma. Hurricanes aren\u2019t exactly surprising in Florida, the spokesperson noted, so the company has plans for when they occur.\n\nBy contrast, this is Jump\u2019s first rodeo. The company, which was acquired by Uber in 2018, operates 250 scooters in Miami and 300 in Tampa. Jump says it will meet Miami\u2019s deadline, and may remove the Tampa scooters as well, depending on the storm\u2019s expected path.\n\nFor Spin, which has operated in Florida for less than a year, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ll have to remove scooters due to weather hazards too. \u201cThe team is always monitoring weather to ensure conditions are safe, and if they are not, we adjust our fleet accordingly,\u201d a spokesperson at Spin says. The company says it will retrieve all scooters before the storm is expected to arrive.\n\nBird said only they are monitoring the conditions across Florida. Their response to the hurricane might include \u201cpausing our service when weather does not permit safe riding, and can sometimes lead to removing Birds from the road during periods of inclement weather such as hurricanes,\u201d a Bird spokesperson said.\n\nLyft and Bolt \u2014 two other scooter companies that operate in Miami \u2014 didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nUpdate, August 30th at 4:34PM ET: Added more information from the cities of Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, as well as Spin.", "description": "Pardon the interruption", "authors": ["Anorte Linsmayer", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qb4TYbhJX4AWHryFXxIXIbNVxsM=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11665125/VRG_ILLO_2724_Scooter_World_Social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
