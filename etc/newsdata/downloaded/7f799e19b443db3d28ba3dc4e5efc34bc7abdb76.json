China will publish figures on trade and economic growth.\n\nMONDAY\n\nChina will see new data on foreign trade for September. Economists expect China's exports fell 3% on year in September, following a 1% drop in August. They expect imports slid 6.0% last month on the back of August's 5.6% decline.\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department releases retail-sales data for September. In August, retail sales climbed 0.4% from a month earlier, providing reassurance that household spending remains an economic bulwark against signs of a global slowdown. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast retail sales increased 0.3% in September from a month prior.\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nThe Federal Reserve releases industrial production figures for September. Economists will monitor this report closely for signs of pickup in manufacturing production. In August, factory output increased 0.5%. Economists surveyed by the Journal forecast overall industrial output declined in September.\n\nChina will receive data on gross domestic product. Economists forecast the nation's GDP grew 6.1% in the third quarter, down from 6.2% in the second quarter. They will parse the report for job and property data, key gauges of Beijing's tolerance for the economic slowdown under way.\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 13, 2019 15:14 ET (19:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
