Neither athlete is accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nAnd Coe is adamant that athletes should not be condemned for links to Salazar.\n\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t live in that world where you just automatically assume the worst,\u201d he said, speaking to the PA news agency in Qatar.\n\n\u201cThe reality of it is, the charges that have been laid by USADA are serious.\n\n\u201cThe AIU (Athletics Integrity Unit) was reaching out to all those athletes and a banned coach has to sever relationships with those athletes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s taking place. Coaches and athletes have to make judgements all the time.\n\n\u201cIf you are coached by somebody, you should be absolutely comfortable you are working in an environment that\u2019s safe and secure and is not going to damage you own reputation.\n\n\u201cMo is an outstanding athlete and I get asked the question regularly, \u2018Should this athlete be with this coach?\u2019\n\n\u201cIf they remain with those coaches, you have to presume they have had those questions satisfactorily answered.\u201d\n\nSalazar had his accreditation stripped by the IAAF, meaning he could have no contact with his athletes.\n\nAnd Coe insists the championships, which had already come in for criticism for poor crowds and intense heat, have not been heavily impacted by news of the 61-year-old\u2019s ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what happens. The media teams dealt with it. We\u2019re dealing with it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t derail the Championship. It may for you guys (the media), but in reality it\u2019s not a broader issue for most people watching the Championships.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the systems in place to deal with that now. If that would\u2019ve happened five or 10 years ago, people would\u2019ve been looking at each other and wondering what we were doing.\n\n\u201cWithin minutes of that, we knew what the process was.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "IAAF president Lord Coe insists athletes\u2019 reputations should not be tarnished by association with Alberto Salazar.
