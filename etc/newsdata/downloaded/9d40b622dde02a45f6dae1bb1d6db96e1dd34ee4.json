Once out of the EU, UK workers\u2019 rights under a hard-right Tory Government will be subject to a relentless process of stagnation, watering down and their eventual elimination.\n\nWhatever the position is on Brexit, the cost of voting for this agreement would be great - diminishing the rights workers have now, purely because the pressure has been ramped up to make progress.\n\nInstead, we should demand that Brexit is not used as an opportunity for the decimation of workers\u2019 rights - because that\u2019s what the Prime Minister envisions for the future for this country.\n\nThe government's eleventh hour empty gesture on workers' rights and environmental protections is not worth the paper it\u2019s written on. If Boris Johnson was committed to workers' rights and environmental rights he wouldn't have spent the last few weeks removing legally-binding commitments from the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\n(Image: Ian Forsyth)\n\nThe reality is that when MPs vote they will still be voting on a sell out Tory deal that provides no guarantees on these fundamental rights and would lead to a race-to-the-bottom on conditions for workers across the country and would worsen the climate crisis.\n\nFor many people, I understand that the world of work is tough. People have less power in the workplace now than they have for decades. Workers in Britain work the longest hours in Europe bar Greece and Austria and for millions of people, their pay does not allow them to live a good life.\n\nBut four and a half decades of EU membership have had a major impact on workers\u2019 rights. Some of these rights are in the treaties, such as the right to equal pay, while others are in \u2018Directives\u2019 which must be implemented by UK legislation, such as the right to holiday pay.\n\nWithout a Labour Government in place, after Brexit, the Tories will be free to repeal or amend the workers\u2019 rights we currently have. In his new deal, the Prime Minister has agreed that future UK governments reserve their right to lower labour law standards. This is far worse than the \u2018level playing field arrangements\u2019 in Theresa May\u2019s deal.\n\nThis is deliberate, so that the Tories can pursue their real aim of a toxic trade deal with Donald Trump, a requirement of which will be to lower standards across our economy and society and offer up the NHS to US corporations. That will be the real moment when control is taken - by US corporations.\n\nThis is not some \u2018worst case scenario\u2019 fear mongering \u2013 we know this because of those who now occupy the cabinet. In Britannia Unchained \u2013 Global Growth and Prosperity, Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss: \u201cThe British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early, and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve had reports that some Ministers are planning to remove the restrictions on working time and paid holidays in the Working Time Directive, a long-standing irritation of those who worship Margaret Thatcher.\n\nIt is worth noting that Johnson has gone on record as suggesting that \u201cstuff such as the working time directive, \u2026, the Data Protection Act, \u2026 and the solvency II directive, many directives and regulations emanating from Brussels have, either through gold-plating in this country or simply because of poor drafting or whatever, been far too expensive \u2026. They are not ideally tailored to the needs of this economy.\u201d Or in other words his millionaire and billionaire friends.\n\nBrexit cannot be allowed to destroy workers\u2019 rights. Instead we must insist on \u2018non-regression\u2019 and \u2018dynamic alignment\u2019 - a commitment that we will keep pace with any progressive developments in the EU, to the benefit of our workers. A Labour government would of course rapidly increase the rights that workers have, but this is an important safeguard.\n\nMuch of what happens in Parliament is theatre: of course, the drama over Brexit has significantly increased and while there is immense pressure to get a deal that is acceptable, to bring certainty to everybody who is worried about their future.\n\nHowever, that pressure should not mean we sell out workers in the process. The political motivation of Boris Johnson and those around him have always been to deliver for the richest in society.\n\nThe Labour Party has always existed to protect workers and we must not fail them now.", "description": "No one should be fooled by the PM's 11th-hour charade to pass his Brexit deal, writes Shadow Minister for labour Laura Pidcock", "authors": ["Laura Pidcock", "Image", "Ian Forsyth"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20329508.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Shut-Down-The-Tories-Protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
