But because of the length of time the body was in the room, a police Disaster Victim Identification team was needed to identify him, local media report.\n\nThe cause of death remains unclear.\n\nThe university said it was \"devastated\" by the death of the first-year student.\n\n\"Despite the comprehensive pastoral care programmes in place, for us it is inconceivable to imagine how these circumstances could have occurred,\" Vice-Chancellor Cheryl de la Rey said in a statement.\n\nThe incident is being examined by a coroner.\n\nNew Zealand's Education Minister Chris Hipkins said he \"expects the university to conduct a thorough investigation\".\n\n\"If you're going into a hall of residence or hostel you're paying a top dollar for not just a roof over your head but also for the pastoral care that goes with that.
