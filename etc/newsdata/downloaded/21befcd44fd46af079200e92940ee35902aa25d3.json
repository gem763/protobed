We are talking about people who use illegal violence,\" she added.\n\nNicholas Chan Hiu Fung, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference said the move would allow people to share views in \"an organised, proper, legal manner.\"\n\nShot protester charged\n\nPolice fired a record 1,400 rounds of tear gas and used water cannon to break up Tuesday's protests, which flared up in different parts of the city.\n\nAn 18-year-old protester was shot in the chest by a police officer after his unit was involved in a skirmish with protesters armed with pipes.\n\nThe secondary school student remains in hospital in a stable condition and was on Thursday among a number of people charged with rioting. A couple of hundred people rallied outside court to show their support for the protesters, Al Jazeera's Sarah Clarke said.\n\n\"Police are still under pressure about why they used live bullets, and why they targeted the protester's chest,\" she said.\n\nPro-democracy lawmaker Dennis Kwok said introducing an emergency law would signal \"the beginning of a slip towards an authoritarian state\".\n\n\"The authorities by now should have listened to the Hong Kong people. Their yearning for freedom, liberty and democracy, is not going to go away,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe protests were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland.\n\n\n\nBut after Beijing and local leaders failed to respond to demonstrators demands the rallies snowballed into a wider movement calling for democratic freedom and police accountability.", "description": "Leader Carrie Lam expected to use colonial-era emergency laws to introduce ban, bypassing the city's legislature.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/29ebb6b7539a4116b65780ff6d7ecfc0_18.jpg"}
