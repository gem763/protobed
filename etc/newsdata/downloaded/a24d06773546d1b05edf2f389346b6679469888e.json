They may need to raise money for things such as a home purchase and a divorce settlement. However, there is only one reason why there would be insider buying of a stock. They believe that they will profit because it is currently undervalued.\n\nInsiders are people who have access to confidential information about a company. There have been numerous cases over the years where insiders take advantage of this in order to profit. For example, suppose an insider knows that news is about to be released that will make the stock go higher. The insider could buy it from a shareholder who does not have access to the news.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne of the rules that the SEC has established to protect investors from this type of illicit activity is to require the insiders to publicly disclose when they are buying or selling their stock. This will help to prevent unethical insiders from taking advantage of uninformed investors.\n\nWhen I am thinking about buying a stock, I always like to see what the insiders are doing. I especially like to see if they are buying after the stock has seen a dramatic drop in price. This could be a sign that the stock is a good value at current levels.\n\nHere are seven stocks that insiders have been buying after they made large moves lower.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chemours Company (CC)\n\nThe Chemours Company (NYSE:CC) sells performance chemicals in markets all over the world.\n\nThe price of CC stock has dropped from $40 a share to current levels around $16 since just this past April. This is due to the fact that the company has missed earnings estimates and reduced its guidance. Because of this, many of the firms that follow it on a research basis have reduced their ratings.\n\nMark Newman is a Senior Vice President and the Chief Operating Officer of Chemours. He must believe that the stock is a great value at these levels because he just made a significant personal investment. Maybe he is attracted to the 6.1% dividend that the stock is currently yielding.\n\nOn Sept. 11 he paid an average price of $16.42 for 20,000 shares. This was an investment of almost $330,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowtek Industries Inc. (FTK)\n\nFlowtek Industries Inc. (NYSE:FTK) provides chemistry and other services to companies in the oil and gas industry.\n\nFTK stock dropped by about 40% in early August when shareholders were disappointed with earnings results. Before the report, shares were trading around $2.80. When the results were released, the stock fell to $2.\n\nThe loss for the quarter was 21 cents. In fiscal 2018, the company reported a loss of $1.21 a share. This was significantly worse than the loss of 44 cents a share that was reported in 2017.\n\nDavid Nierenberg is a Director of the company. He must think that the sellers have overreacted to this news because he just made a substantial investment of almost $650,000. Between Sept. 10 and Sept. 12 Nierenberg acquired about 270,000 shares of stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nSignet Jewelers LTD.
