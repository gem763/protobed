French law currently allows assisted reproduction only for infertile heterosexual couples.\n\nThe country\u2019s health care system would cover the cost of the procedures for all women under 43.\n\nIt also would allow children conceived with donated sperm to find out the donor\u2019s identity upon demand when they reach age 18, a change from France\u2019s current strict donor anonymity protections.\n\nThe measure is sensitive in a country where a law allowing same-sex marriage in 2013 saw hundreds of thousands of protesters in Paris.\n\nThe new bill does not cover surrogacy arrangements, which are banned in France.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "France's parliament is set to debate a bill that would give single women and lesbian couples access to in-vitro fertilization and related procedures.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
