I can't say this racist chanting is normal in Bulgarian matches,\" she said.\n\nKamen Alipiev, a sports reporter based in Sofia, said there were wider societal issues over why racism was still a problem among Bulgarian fans.\n\n\"We have problems with communications with our Roma Gypsies in the area, with refugees coming from Asia and Africa... so maybe sometimes it sounds like it's normal.\"\n\nThe fans \"can't imagine that they are racist,\" he explained.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Bulgarian fans hold up a \"No respect\" jumper\n\nTihomir Bezlov and Dr Atanas Rusev, researchers at the Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD) in Sofia, believe the behaviour is not only driven by racist attitudes, but also financial interests.\n\nSome supporters with a history of racist behaviour demand payment from clubs in order to stop, they say.\n\nWho are Bulgaria's hooligans?\n\nIn 2015, the CSD produced a report entitled Radicalisation in Bulgaria: Threats and Trends. It documents widespread racism among the country's football supporters.\n\n\"A famous Levski supporter explained that he does not like African-Americans, Turkish people and Arabs, but he does not mind the dark-skinned football players of Levski,\" the report notes.\n\nAlthough \"skinheads sharing racist views used to be very popular in CSKA factions\", the report says their influence has been diminished, partly because of the interventions of a fan leader, Rossen \"the Animal\" Petrov.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bulgaria v England: Tyrone Mings heard racist abuse before warming up\n\nThe CSD researchers, Mr Alipiev and Bulgarian reporter Momchil Indjov, told the BBC they suspected there were links between football hooligans and far-right nationalist movements.\n\nDr Rusev said hooligans had been mobilised during protests and to attack Roma communities.\n\nMr Indjov said he believed many of those involved in the racist abuse on Monday were part of SW99 - a hooligan faction belonging to Levski Sofia - and said the behaviour appeared planned.\n\nMr Bezlov said police had told him that CSKA Sofia fans were involved.\n\nThe final straw?\n\nWhile Bulgaria has faced criticism for its efforts - or lack thereof - at combating racism in football in the past, Monday night's scenes appear to have been taken more seriously.\n\nThe match was halted twice, and on Tuesday the president of the BFU, Borislav Mihaylov, resigned after being told to quit by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Borislav Mihaylov (left) resigned as president of the BFU on Tuesday\n\nThe president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, said the \"football family and governments\" need to \"wage war on the racists\".\n\n\"There were times, not long ago, when the football family thought that the scourge of racism was a distant memory,\" Mr Ceferin said.\n\n\"The last couple of years have taught us that such thinking was, at best, complacent.\"\n\nThe British government said it had written to Uefa to demand more action, and Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Bulgaria.\n\nThe shame many Bulgarians have felt from the behaviour of some of its fans on Monday could result in a long-overdue discussion about racism in the country, Mr Alipiev said.\n\n\"It will definitely create a discussion, especially after the reaction of our prime minister today... I think a red light is going on across the country,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not just about the football fans. We need to speak about our ability to accept others, not only in the stadiums.\n\n\"I really hope there will be a public discussion because it's a discussion about the state of the nation.\"", "description": "Could Bulgaria's latest football racism scandal change how it deals with the problem?", "authors": ["George Wright", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FB12/production/_109247246_mediaitem109247245.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
