REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/File Photo\n\nThe world\u2019s best-known advertising boss is building up the new venture following his departure from ad giant WPP, sealing deals for digital content that runs on platforms like Facebook and Google, and the automated placing of ads online.\n\nSorrell said digital growth was \u201con fire\u201d and his focus on it meant he was currently involved in five large pitches.\n\nS4 will gain access to Firewood\u2019s client base in the United States, including Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Salesforce and VMware.\n\nS4 raised 100 million pounds ($123 million) through a placing to part fund the Firewood deal and to build up a war chest for future acquisitions.\n\nRather than replicate WPP, the world\u2019s biggest advertising company he created with a holding company model, Sorrell is buying smaller agencies and merging them into one arm producing content and one arm handling the programmatic placing of ads.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to end up with a fragmented model,\u201d he said.\n\nSorrell told Reuters he is still looking to acquire companies that own first-party data on consumer habits, but said he had two small deals looming for data analytics companies, with one in London and one in Korea.\n\n\u201cThey will slot in to the programmatic offer,\u201d he said.\n\nS4 has already won work from the likes of Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Coca-Cola and Sprint and had said it was being asked to bid for other major clients.\n\nIndustry data released on Monday showed the U.S. advertising market remained solid, helped by small- and medium-sized companies spending on digital platforms to reach customers.", "description": "Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital has bought Silicon Valley's biggest independent agency, Firewood, for $150 million in its latest deal to form a purely digital global advertising firm.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438376624&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970HY", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
