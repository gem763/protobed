All around her, houses were still boarded up or covered with sagging scabs of blue emergency tarp. Some still had no windows and bore yellow stickers that warned \u201cRESTRICTED USE.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels that much emptier today than it did before,\u201d she said.\n\nShe was relieved that Dorian had not left any fresh wounds. Ms. Ballard still has to tear up the ruined subfloor on her house and then get expert advice on how she should rebuild. Moving in is months away, but she has not contemplated surrendering.\n\n\u201cWhere am I going to go?\u201d she asked.\n\nRick and Stephanie Garrett have no desire to leave. The river behind their home in the woods was still rising on Friday even as the sun swept scraps of rain and clouds away, and forecasters predicted the river would keep going up through Sunday.\n\nThey have raised their home twice, and it now sits like a treehouse among the cypresses and oaks. It still took on a foot of water last year during Hurricane Florence, and the Garretts had to cut out drywall and rip out carpets.\n\nThe Garretts, both scientists, said that they did not doubt the threat of climate change, but that nearly any home anywhere carried some risks. Their house was untouched by Dorian, but as they inspected their dirt road for fallen trees on Friday, they pondered how high and how dry they really were, even 16 feet up.", "description": "Most residents in eastern North Carolina, where people rattle off the names of storms like old enemies, were spared the worst from Dorian.
