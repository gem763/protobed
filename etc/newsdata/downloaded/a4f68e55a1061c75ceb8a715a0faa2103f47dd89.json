(AP) - Cam Newton thinks he knows why the Panthers aren\u2019t throwing more deep passes.\n\nThe 2015 league MVP joked that Panthers offensive coordinator Norv Turner must have Christian McCaffrey on his fantasy football team, a reference to the Carolina running back getting the bulk of action in Week 1 and racking up 209 yards from scrimmage and scoring two touchdowns - on 29 total touches - in Carolina\u2019s 30-27 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nNewton, meanwhile, did not throw or run for a TD against the Rams and only attempted one pass of longer than 20 yards.\n\n\u201cI think that is what it is,\u201d Newton said with a big smile. \u201cDoggone Norv gone and picked CMAC for fantasy, man. I should have went over and seen who he was drafting in his league.\u201d\n\nThen Newton paused and continued joking, \u201cThat\u2019s probably why we ain\u2019t throwing no deep passes, right? He didn\u2019t pick me for his quarterback! Now it\u2019s all making sense.\u201d\n\nAll kidding aside, there is some question about why Newton still isn\u2019t throwing deep even though he\u2019s supposedly healed and under no restrictions from the coaching staff following arthroscopic surgery in January.\n\nNewton attempted 38 passes against the Rams, but most were check-downs or passes underneath the coverage. His only attempt beyond 20 yards was a ball that sailed 25 yards through the air and over the head of wide receiver Curtis Samuel.\n\nThat\u2019s reminiscent of last season when Newton struggled through a lingering shoulder injury that limited his arm strength. He rarely threw a pass of more than 20 yards in the second half of last season.\n\nNewton has insisted his shoulder is fine entering Thursday night\u2019s game against Tampa Bay and that it didn\u2019t bother him in Week 1.\n\nThe 30-yard quarterback said he\u2019s grown tired of people asking him questions about it, and his standard answer has been that he\u2019s \u201ctaking what the defense gives him.\u201d\n\nStill, the questions will continue until he proves he can throw deep in a real game.\n\n\u201cYou are only asking me because of my shoulder,\u201d Newton said. \u201cHow about this, talk to the defensive coordinator for Tampa and ask if they don\u2019t think I can throw the ball over 20 yards and see how far that gets you.\u201d\n\nBuccaneers coach Bruce Arians said he believes Newton.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is any doubt about it or he wouldn\u2019t be playing,\u201d Arians said. \u201cYeah, he has all of his tools and he\u2019s ready to go.\u201d\n\nArians said the Bucs won\u2019t defend Newton any differently on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to find out in a game,\u201d Arians said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cam Newton thinks he knows why the Panthers aren't throwing more deep passes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/rams_panthers_football_66706_c0-98-2345-1465_s1770x1032.jpg?f72c27f83b611650d85fc9d674cc83ff0aba4299", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
