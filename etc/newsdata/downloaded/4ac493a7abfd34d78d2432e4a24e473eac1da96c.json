He remains the most popular candidate among voters aged 65 and older, at 39 per cent, while Mr Sanders carries 26 per cent of the vote among voters aged 18-49.\n\nWhen asked which candidates are best suited to handle six critical issues, a majority of survey respondents picked Mr Biden among four of those issues. He falls short in health care, where Mr Sanders polled at 28 per cent.\n\nBut Mr Biden is leading among candidates when it comes to foreign policy (56 per cent) and the economy (38 per cent). He also is matched by Mr Sanders at 26 per cent for addressing the climate crisis; both candidates polled at 19 per cent in June.\n\nMr Biden's spike arrives as Congress pursues its impeachment probe into President Donald Trump, who asked Ukraine for damaging information on the former vice-president as part of a so-called \"quid pro quo\" in exchange for security aid. Mr Biden's son Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while Mr Biden was serving as vice-president under President Barack Obama.\n\nWhen it comes to whether the candidates can defeat Mr Trump in 2020, voters surveyed gave the Democratic frontrunners a significant advantage over the president in hypothetical match-ups. Respondents said Mr Biden could win by 10 points at 53 per cent with Mr Trump at 43 per cent, while Mr Sanders tops Mr Trump by nine points (52 per cent to 43 per cent) and Ms Warren by eight points (52 per cent to 44 per cent).\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
