REUTERS/Charles Platiau\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google on Monday launched a debit card payment function in Brazil through Google Pay, to boost use of its Android smartphones.\n\nOnline retailers in Brazil often take only credit cards, not debit cards, because of a higher incidence of fraud, a problem Google said it has tackled, without disclosing how.\n\nJoao Felix, responsible for Google Pay in Latin America, said Brazil has 60 million debit card holders, while credit card holders total 50 million. By enabling debit card payments, Google increases its target market, he added.\n\nFurther details on the new debit function or usage estimates were not provided.\n\nGoogle will not charge retailers, card issuers or card processors for the use of its debit payment platform. Felix said the company\u2019s goal is to increase Android smartphone\u2019s usage.\n\nCard issuers Banco do Brasil SA, Banco Bradesco SA and Itau Unibanco Holding SA will allow clients to use the Google Pay\u2019s debit function, as well as card networks Mastercard (MA.N), Visa (V.N) and Elo and e-commerce platforms, such as delivery apps Rappi and iFood.", "description": "Alphabet Inc's Google on Monday launched a debit card payment function in Brazil through Google Pay, to boost use of its Android smartphones.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440868490&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1BG", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
