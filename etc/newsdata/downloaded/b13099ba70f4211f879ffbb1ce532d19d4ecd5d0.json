According to XDA Developers, Google is at work on a Personal Safety app with \u201ccar crash detection.\u201d With the help of various sensors including the accelerometer and even the microphone, Pixel phones will attempt to detect an accident. If one occurs, the phone will loudly sound an alarm, and if there\u2019s no response, it will automatically call 911 and provide your location to emergency services in the US.\n\nXDA Developers managed to catch the Play Store listing that Google posted prematurely, which included several screenshots of the Personal Safety app. Based on those images, people will have more than one opportunity after a detected accident to confirm that they\u2019re okay and prevent an emergency call from being placed; the demo apparently asks twice for a response before initiating the 911 process.\n\nSo, how does all of this work? Google says Personal Safety uses a Pixel\u2019s location, motion sensors, and \u201cambient audio\u201d from the microphone to figure out if an accident has occurred. (Perhaps it\u2019s listening for broken glass or collisions similar to how Alexa Guard can hear break-ins.) But the company also warns that \u201chigh-impact activities might activate car crash detection,\u201d so there might be occasions where you\u2019ll have to tap \u201cI\u2019m OK\u201d to stop a false-trigger emergency call. After confirming that you\u2019re okay, Personal Safety asks what happened, and you can pick between no crash or minor crash to help improve future detection accuracy.\n\nThe Personal Safety listing reveals that car crash functionality will only be available in the United States whenever this feature rolls out. Speaking of, it\u2019s likely this app will debut as yet another new software trick of the Pixel 4 before expanding to older Pixel devices.\n\nI\u2019m all for features like this. Yes, there might be the occasional mixup and erroneous 911 call, but car crash detection could also save many people who are incapacitated after an accident. Approximately 40,000 people died in road accidents in the US last year. If this can help lower that number, why not?\n\nOutside of road incidents, Personal Safety will also be able to automatically message your emergency contacts if you find yourself in a dangerous situation and need help.\n\nWe should learn more about Personal Safety at Google\u2019s Pixel 4 event on October 15th.", "description": "Google is working on a new app for its Pixel smartphones that will use hardware sensors to detect an auto accident and automatically call emergency services if a person fails to respond.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AUvRbNMJrgDgGKm7-aBX6R12j-Y=/0x46:1198x673/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19248566/Pasted_Graphic.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
