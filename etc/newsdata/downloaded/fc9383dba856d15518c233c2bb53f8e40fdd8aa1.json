She later fled the United States, claiming diplomatic immunity, since her husband works on an intelligence compound that reportedly has special diplomatic status.\n\nSince Ms Sacoolas returned to the United States she has issued an apology, but had not spoken directly to the Dunn family as of Monday. The UK Foreign Office has also indicated that diplomatic immunity does not apply in cases such as these.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If you\u2019re a father and your child had died, surely you would want that person to own up and take the responsibility of their own actions. That\u2019s all it is,\u201d Mr Dunn said.\n\nA tearful Ms Charles told reporters: \u201cWe just want to know that she is being brought back to the UK.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It\u2019s the only right thing to do. It\u2019s the only humane thing to do.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAll of our grief has gone on hold, it\u2019s coming out in other horrific ways, your legs feel like lead, you\u2019re in pain morning until night that no painkillers can take away.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not able to cry, because we can\u2019t understand this whole situation as to why she [Ms Sacoolas] would have left us without wanting to meet us back then.\n\n\u201cShe needs to get on the plane and get back to the UK, just do the right thing.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that difficult, it shouldn\u2019t have been this difficult, she surely didn\u2019t have to go.\u201d\n\nThe pair also indicated that they merely wanted to see justice for their son, and had been prepared to help Ms Sacoolas to avoid the steepest punishments possible. But, her decision to flee has potentially damaged that goodwill.\n\nIt is not clear what Mr Trump might do if he were compelled to intervene, and appeared to last week defend Ms Sacoolas for what he described as a mistake as a result of being unfamiliar with different road systems in the UK compared to the US.\n\n\"The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road. That can happen,\" Mr Trump said. \"Those are the opposite side of the road. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did.\"", "description": "Harry Dunn's family has been invited to the White House for an \"urgent meeting\", as they seek to pressure the woman suspected of killing\u00a0their son to return to the United Kingdom.
