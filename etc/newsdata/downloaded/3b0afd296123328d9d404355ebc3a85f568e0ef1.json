The target set for them in Tokyo is between eight and 10.\n\nMore damaging for him was his continued support for Alberto Salazar, who was last week handed a four-year ban for multiple coaching violations.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: British Athletics via Getty Imag)\n\nUK Athletics conducted a review in 2015 and said there was \"no concern\" about Salazar's link with Mo Farah, Britain\u2019s leading athlete.\n\nBlack, who took charge in 2013, referred to Salazar as a \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201cone of the best people to work with that I have ever come across\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nOn Sunday night he admitted he had been \u201cshocked\u201d by the verdict on Salazar.
