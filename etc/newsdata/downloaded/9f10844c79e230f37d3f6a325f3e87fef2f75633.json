It was 1995, and Mr. Barr saw an urgent threat to religion generally and to Catholicism, his faith, specifically. The danger came from the rise of \u201cmoral relativism,\u201d in Mr. Barr\u2019s view. \u201cThere are no objective standards of right and wrong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEveryone writes their own rule book.\u201d\n\nAnd so, at first, it seemed surprising that Mr. Barr, now 69, would return after 26 years to the job of attorney general, to serve Donald Trump, the moral relativist in chief, who writes and rewrites the rule book at whim.\n\nBut a close reading of his speeches and writings shows that, for decades, he has taken a maximalist, Trumpian view of presidential power that critics have called the \u201cimperial executive.\u201d He was a match, all along, for a president under siege. \u201cHe alone is the executive branch,\u201d Mr. Barr wrote of whoever occupies the Oval Office, in a memo to the Justice Department in 2018, before he returned.\n\nWilliam Barr in Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s office in January before hearings on his nomination to be attorney general. Erin Schaff for The New York Times\n\nNow, with news reports that his review into the origins of the Russian investigation that so enraged Mr. Trump has turned into a full-blown criminal investigation, Mr. Barr is arousing fears that he is using the enormous power of the Justice Department to help the president politically, subverting the independence of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency in the process.\n\nWhy is he giving the benefit of his reputation, earned over many years in Washington, to this president? His Catholic Lawyer article suggests an answer to that question. The threat of moral relativism he saw then came when \u201csecularists used law as a weapon.\u201d Mr. Barr cited rules that compel landlords to rent to unmarried couples or require universities to treat \u201chomosexual activist groups like any other student group.\u201d He reprised the theme in a speech at Notre Dame this month.\n\nBarr uses the same language and ideas in an article and speech separated by decades. 1995 Article in The Catholic Lawyer, \u201cLegal Issues in a New Political Order\u201d Highlighted text appears in both quotations 2019 Remarks to the Law School and the de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture at the University of Notre Dame Barr uses the same language and ideas in an article and speech separated by decades. 1995 article in The Catholic Lawyer, \u201cLegal Issues in a New Political Order\u201d Highlighted text appears in both quotations 2019 remarks to the Law School and the de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture at the University of Notre Dame Barr uses the same language and ideas in an article and speech separated by decades. 1995 article in The Catholic Lawyer, \u201cLegal Issues in a New Political Order\u201d Highlighted text appears in both quotes 2019 remarks to the Law School and the de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture at the University of Notre Dame | Source:\n\nIn 1995 and now, Mr. Barr has voiced the fears and aspirations of the conservative legal movement. By helping Mr. Trump, he\u2019s protecting a president who has succeeded in confirming more than 150 judges to create a newly conservative judiciary. The federal bench now seems more prepared to lower barriers between church and state and reduce access to abortion \u2014 a procedure that Mr. Barr, in his 1995 article, included on a list of societal ills that also included drug addiction, venereal diseases and psychiatric disorders.\n\nIn his unruffled and lawyerly way, Mr. Barr emerged as the president\u2019s most effective protector in the spring, when he limited damage from the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election by shaping the public narrative of the Mueller report before he released any of it.\n\nIn his pursuit of investigating the investigators, he even traveled to Britain and Italy to meet with intelligence officials there to persuade them to help it along. Now it is possible the Justice Department could bring charges against its own officials and agents for decisions they made to investigate Trump campaign advisers in the fraught months around the 2016 election, when the Russian government was mounting what the Mueller report called \u201ca sweeping and systematic\u201d effort to interfere.\n\nThis criminal investigation seems ominous in the context of Mr. Barr\u2019s other moves.\n\nDec. 19, 1991, Attorney General William P.

Last week, dozens of government inspectors general warned in a letter to the Justice Department that its position \u201ccould seriously undermine the critical role whistle blowers play in coming forward to report waste, fraud, abuse and misconduct across the federal government.\u201d\n\nSo while Rudolph Giuliani is freelancing American diplomacy as the president\u2019s personal lawyer, often leaving bedlam in his wake, and Mick Mulvaney flails as acting chief of staff, Mr. Barr has used the Justice Department, with precision, on the president\u2019s behalf. The New York City Bar Association complained a few days ago that Mr. Barr \u201cappears to view his primary obligation as loyalty to the president individually rather than to the nation.\u201d\n\nWilliam Barr (Billy, when he was young) grew up in an apartment on Riverside Drive in Manhattan with a framed Barry Goldwater presidential campaign poster in the foyer, according to Vanity Fair. His mother, who was of Irish descent, taught at Columbia University. His father, a Jew who converted to Catholicism, taught at Columbia, too, and then became the headmaster of the elite Dalton School, leaving after 10 years amid criticism over his authoritarian approach to student discipline.\n\nHe went to high school at the equally elite Horace Mann and to college at Columbia, where he majored in government and then got a master\u2019s degree in government and Chinese studies. Mr. Barr went to work for the C.I.A. in Washington in 1973 and attended George Washington University Law School at night.\n\nHe joined the Reagan White House in 1982, where he sought to curb regulation. After George H.W. Bush was elected president in 1988, he became director of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department, which provides legal advice to the president and all executive agencies.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Mr. Barr to express his views on executive power. He warned in one of his early opinions, in July 1989, of congressional \u201cencroachments\u201d on presidential authority. \u201cOnly by consistently and forcefully resisting such congressional incursions can executive branch prerogatives be preserved,\u201d he wrote. Some of his Republican colleagues remember being taken aback.\n\n\u201cBill\u2019s view on the separation of powers was not overlapping authority keeping all branches in check, but keeping the other branches neutralized, leaving a robust executive power to rule. George III would have loved it,\u201d said Douglas Kmiec, a law professor at Pepperdine who preceded Mr. Barr as head of the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nMr. Barr also argued that the president had the \u201cinherent authority\u201d to order the F.B.I. to abduct people abroad, in violation of an international treaty principally written by the United States. This view reversed the position that the Office of Legal Counsel had taken nine years earlier. When Congress asked to see Mr. Barr\u2019s opinion, he refused, even as the government defended the abduction of a man in Mexico accused of participating in the killing of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent. The charges against the man were dismissed. It took four years for his opinion to come to light.\n\n\u201cYou have a secret opinion that violated the internal rules of the Justice Department\u201d and \u201cdiminished America\u2019s reputation as a country that operates by the rule of law,\u201d said Harold Hongju Koh, a Yale law professor who worked in the Office of Legal Counsel and advised the State Department. \u201cAt the time, we thought that was as bad as it was going to get.\u201d\n\nAfter becoming deputy attorney general in 1990, he continued to push the limits on questions of presidential power. He told the first President Bush that he didn\u2019t need congressional approval to invade Iraq. Mr. Bush asked for it anyway.\n\nMr. Barr with President George H.W. Bush in 1992. Marcy Nighswander/Associated Press\n\nMr. Barr, who took over the department in the fall of 1991, also urged Mr. Bush to pardon all six of the Reagan administration officials who faced criminal charges in an arms-for-hostages deal at the heart of the Iran-contra scandal. The president took his advice.\n\nWhen Mr. Bush lost his bid for re-election, Mr. Barr went back into private practice before taking jobs as the general counsel first for GTE and then Verizon. He served on the boards of several religious groups, including the Catholic Information Center, a self-described \u201cintellectual hub,\u201d affiliated with the ultraconservative order Opus Dei.\n\nThose groups include other conservative Washington insiders, such as Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society. Mr. Leo has also served on the board of the Catholic Information Center and he came out strongly in favor of Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination of Mr. Barr for attorney general.\n\nIn a sense, both Mr. Barr and Mr. Leo have found parallel ways to use the Trump administration as a vehicle for their causes. Mr. Leo has enormous influence from outside the government on the selection of judicial nominees. And from the inside, Mr. Barr plays a role in federal judicial appointments and has supported a Justice Department task force set up to look for cases of religious discrimination.\n\nWhen Mr. Barr undercut the Mueller report, he lost some supporters. While delaying its release, he presented the conclusions as far less damning for President Trump than Mr. Mueller found them to be. (For example, Mr. Barr said that the special counsel did not find sufficient evidence of a crime when in fact Mr. Mueller had not exonerated Mr. Trump of wrongdoing.)\n\n\u201cNot in my memory has a sitting attorney general more diminished the credibility of his department on any subject,\u201d wrote Benjamin Wittes, the editor in chief of Lawfare.\n\nDespite criticism, Mr. Barr has continued to champion the presidency \u2014 and this president. But on Friday, a federal judge in Washington ruled against the Justice Department\u2019s effort to block Congress from getting grand jury evidence obtained in the Mueller investigation. The department has also asked a federal judge to block a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney for eight years of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective,\u201d Mr. Barr told Jan Crawford of CBS News in May, \u201cthe idea of resisting a democratically elected president and basically throwing everything at him and, you know, really changing the norms on the grounds that \u2018we have to stop this president,\u2019 that is where the shredding of our norms and our institutions is occurring.\u201d\n\nIn other words, amazingly, it wasn\u2019t President Trump, or Attorney General Barr, who was violating the norms of American governance. It was their critics.\n\nSince Watergate, a crucial norm of Justice Department independence has prevented presidents from ordering or meddling in investigations for partisan reasons.\n\nIn 2001, Mr. Barr praised the first President Bush for leaving the Justice Department alone. Mr. Bush\u2019s White House \u201cappreciated the independence of Justice,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that there\u2019s a difference between being a government lawyer and representing an individual in his personal capacity in a criminal case.\u201d\n\nNow, Mr. Barr seems hard-pressed to maintain a semblance of those boundaries. The criminal investigation of the origins of the Russia investigation that he ordered is official government business. It\u2019s headed by an experienced prosecutor, John H. Durham, the United States attorney for Connecticut, and it\u2019s supposed to be on the up and up.\n\nMr. Barr in May testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Erin Schaff/The New York Times\n\nBut when Mr. Barr told Congress in April that he thought \u201cspying\u201d on the Trump campaign by American intelligence agencies occurred \u2014 the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, told Congress that \u201cspying\u201d was \u201cnot the term I would use\u201d \u2014 he echoed President Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory of being a victim of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d And in the last month, Mr. Barr has found his review mixed up with the machinations of Mr. Giuliani, who was directed by Mr. Trump to investigate the 2016 election and the Biden family in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Trump made the overlap explicit when he lumped Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Barr together in his July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky, according to notes released by the White House. Mr. Barr was reportedly \u201csurprised and angry\u201d by the president\u2019s reference, and a Justice Department representative has denied he had any contacts with Mr. Zelensky.\n\nThen, Mr. Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, brought up Mr. Barr\u2019s review of the Russia investigation at his news conference on Oct. 17 in defense of Mr. Trump\u2019s request to Mr. Zelensky for \u201ca favor\u201d and information. (\u201cSo you\u2019re saying the president of the United States, the chief law enforcement person, cannot ask somebody to cooperate with an ongoing public investigation into wrongdoing?\u201d Mr. Mulvaney asked.)\n\nThe White House\u2019s use of the Justice Department as a shield in the Ukraine scandal risks leaving Mr. Barr\u2019s review \u201chopelessly compromised,\u201d tweeted the Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith, an alumnus of the Office of Legal Counsel who has defended Mr. Barr.\n\nAnd in blockbuster testimony before Congress last Tuesday, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor, said that he and Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, who was conveying Mr. Trump\u2019s orders concerning Ukraine, discussed the possibility that Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor would make a public statement about \u201cinvestigations, potentially in coordination with Attorney General Barr\u2019s probe.\u201d Either people in the president\u2019s circle are using Mr. Barr as a pawn, or he\u2019s in deeper than he has said.\n\nEither way, maybe the lesson is the same one that applies throughout the administration: The fallout from the president\u2019s maneuvering taints the people around him. The longer Mr. Barr stays in office, the more that Mr. Trump will look for the attorney general to do for him.\n\nWhen Mr. Mueller closed up shop, he left several cases pending with the Justice Department,including charges against the Trump operative Roger Stone, which could end with disclosures at trial that damage the president (Mr. Stone has pleaded not guilty). What if Mr. Trump would rather make cases like these go away, with pardons or other inducements? Will Mr. Barr go along?\n\nMr. Barr has echoed President Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory of being a victim of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nDuring the Bush administration, in a more moderate time, Mr. Barr worked for a buttoned-down president who called for a \u201ckinder\u201d and \u201cgentler\u201d strain of Republicanism. Now he has a boss who calls the impeachment process \u201ca lynching,\u201d Republican critics \u201chuman scum\u201d and the news media \u201cthe enemy of the American people.\u201d\n\nAs the buttons fly off, Mr. Barr still seems unperturbed. He\u2019s the perfect attorney general for President Trump. Not so much, it seems, for the country.", "description": "The attorney general? Trump\u2019s protector?
