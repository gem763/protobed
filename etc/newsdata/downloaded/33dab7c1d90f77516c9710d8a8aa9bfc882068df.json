Pope Francis will consider it, along with many others on issues including the environment and the role of women, in a future document of his own.\n\nOne of the most contentious items in the 120-paragraph final document from the synod, the proposal calls for married men who are already deacons in the Church and are proven leaders in their communities to be ordained as priests.\n\nIt said the ordination to the priesthood would have to be preceded by an 'adequate formation'. This solution to the shortage of priests, backed by many South American bishops, would allow Catholics in isolated areas to attend Mass and receive the sacraments more regularly.\n\nAt least 85 per cent of Amazon villages cannot attend Mass every week and some cannot do so for years\n\nAt least 85 per cent of Amazon villages cannot attend Mass every week and some cannot do so for years.\n\nConservatives oppose the change, fearing it would be a slippery slope leading to a married priesthood throughout the 1.3 billion member Church.\n\nThe document said that some bishops in the synod thought the issue of a married priesthood should be discussed on a universal basis.", "description": "Pope Francis hosted a three-week synod discussing the current state of the Roman Catholic church in the Amazon region with a group of almost 170 bishops.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/21/20224868-0-image-a-15_1572121317807.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
