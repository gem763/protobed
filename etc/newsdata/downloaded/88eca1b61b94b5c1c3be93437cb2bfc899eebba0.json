He thinks they should. This is a terrible idea.\n\nThe tax deduction for charitable contributions offer significant support to houses of worship. If you\u2019re in the top tax bracket, the true cost of a $100 gift to your church is only $63, since you don\u2019t have to pay the 37 percent tax rate on the $100 of income you are giving away. This leads to more charitable giving than there would otherwise be.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say what would happen to the total amount of charitable contributions if Mr. O\u2019Rourke has his way. But I discuss some evidence in my latest Bloomberg column.\n\nForthcoming research by economists and charitable-giving experts Jonathan Meer and Benjamin Priday finds that a 10% increase in the \u201cprice of giving\u201d reduces philanthropy by a little over 10%. (The price of giving changes when Congress changes marginal income tax rates.) For households in the top tax bracket, eliminating the deduction entirely for religious organizations that oppose same-sex marriage \u2014 as O\u2019Rourke says he would attempt to do if elected president \u2014 would increase the taxpayers\u2019 cost of giving to those groups by 59%. This would cause their charitable contributions to plummet.\n\nWhy else to be opposed to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s idea? Income given freely away should not be taxed. Churches, mosques, and synagogues are tax exempt because many of the services they offer are complimentary to government programs. The American tradition of turning not only to government for the provision of social services. And:\n\nWhen the U.S.\u2019s social ecology is healthy, religious organizations and the government enjoy a wide distance. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan would have the state put the church under a microscope, inspecting its theology and rituals to ensure that they support same-sex marriage, doling out tax breaks to some and not to others. He would keep the tax exemptions for those churches, mosques and synagogues that subscribe to his preferred theology. Those that don\u2019t would be required to provide financial support to the government.\n\nCheck out my column for my full argument.
