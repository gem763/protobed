And to see them playing out from the back restoring our faith in the fact that English teams can do so.\n\nWe know that back home they restored a lot of pride and brought some unity to the country. They have changed the way the players are viewed and have given everyone some hope in the national team.\n\nGareth Southgate should take immense credit for all of the above, and partly for devising a system that suited these players. We don\u2019t really have the kind of midfielder who controls the tempo of a game or who threads through little creative passes, like Philippe Coutinho or Luka Modric. So he had to make the best use of our running strengths from midfield with Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard.\n\nEngland have once again been enjoyable to watch at a major tournament in Russia this summer\n\nGareth Southgate should take immense credit for devising a system that suited these players\n\nThe back three allowed Harry Maguire to shine and bring the ball out, as did John Stones, though I\u2019d still like to have seen him playing on the right side of defence so that he had even more opportunities to do that. Harry Kane could take the Golden Boot, we got through a penalty shootout and won two knock-out games, so there\u2019s much to be positive about.\n\nOf course, Gareth Southgate and the players will forever rue a missed opportunity. One-nil up at half-time and hanging on with 22 minutes to play took them close to football\u2019s ultimate game.\n\nI\u2019m sure the staff will know things they could have changed in the second half. The most obvious one was that while the 3-5-2 shape worked well for us against lesser opposition, it became 5-3-2 against better teams. And then it lost its effectiveness. All systems have their achilles heel and, as a big advocate of the back three, I\u2019m well aware of how it can go wrong.\n\nIt is what happened in the second half when Ante Rebic and Ivan Perisic started getting on the front foot. Suddenly Kieran Trippier and Ashley Young were forced into full-back positions, almost for the first time in the tournament. England\u2019s back three then ended up marking one man in Mario Mandzukic.\n\nBut the 3-5-2 formation became 5-3-2 against better teams and then it lost its effectiveness\n\nEngland lack the kind of midfielder who controls the tempo of a game like Luka Modric\n\nKieran Trippier and Ashley Young were forced into full-back positions by Croatia's wingers\n\nThe fact that Trippier and Young were pushed back meant there was space for Sime Vrsaljko, the Croatia right-back, to push on. (You didn\u2019t see it as much from Ivan Strinic, the left-back, as he was carrying an injury.) So Alli then had to shuttle across to cover his left flank as well as trying to deal with Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic. He covered an extraordinary 9.7 miles in the game, 4.2 miles off the ball; more than anyone other than Marcelo Brozovic. So there was even more space for Modric to operate in.\n\nWith everyone deep and Dele preoccupied with an extra man, England couldn\u2019t muster an attacking threat. Which meant that man Modric simply got more and more of the ball, and England were just hanging on.\n\nIt needed a change before Croatia scored their second goal. Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane were still playing as a front two, when Sterling should have been told to come across and stop Vrsaljko\u2019s runs. When Marcus Rashford came on I thought that was where he would have played. But he more or less played in the same position as Sterling.\n\nThe other way to change is to switch to a back four when you\u2019re defending, with Kyle Walker coming out to right back. That allows Kieran Trippier to move up and supplements your midfield, which supports Dele. You would get Lingard to harry their holding midfielder and that way you\u2019re not outnumbered.\n\nDele Alli had to shuttle across to cover as well as dealing with both Modric and Ivan Rakitic\n\nRaheem Sterling (pictured) or Marcus Rashford should have been asked to help out at the back\n\nGareth Southgate will have a plan for next time and against Spain next is the perfect challenge\n\nAs soon as you win the ball back you can morph into a back three again, with Maguire pushing up a bit alongside Walker with Stones as the sweeper. Trippier and Young are then conventional wing-backs again. I used that system in a friendly game against Portugal in 1998 with David Beckham and Graeme Le Saux as wing-backs.\n\nKnowing Gareth Southgate, he\u2019ll have a plan for next time. Coincidentally, the next two games in UEFA\u2019s new Nations League are against Croatia and Spain.\n\nSo it\u2019s the perfect time to try something new. Spain will have more possession than us so it\u2019s a perfect chance to work out how to beat the better teams.\n\nOverall, Southgate and Steve Holland deserve huge credit for devising a system which has all but ended the problems we used to have against lesser sides when we used to find ourselves not creating chances and not getting opportunities. Now let\u2019s take the next step and see off the better teams.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a great game to finish the World Cup on a high\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a great team at this World Cup, nor a truly great individual. Which is curious because it feels as though it has been an excellent competition. I think that\u2019s because we\u2019ve seen so many good games, from Spain against Portugal, Germany against Mexico and Sweden, Argentina against Croatia and Nigeria and then against France in the last 16. Then there was Belgium against Japan and their superb clash with Brazil...\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen some great moments from Kylian Mbappe. Not enough to call him a true great. He didn\u2019t quite do enough in the semi-final, but he is only 19. His performance against Argentina was excellent. The run he made for the penalty put me in mind of Michael Owen\u2019s against Argentina in 1998 when he burst on the world scene.\n\nMbappe created the greatest buzz among the fans here when he got the ball and in that respect he outshone Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, who went home early.\n\nN\u2019Golo Kante has been outstanding in all aspects of his game and has had a superb World Cup\n\nFor Croatia, a nation of four million people, to win the World Cup on Sunday would be historic\n\nFrance played well against Argentina but there\u2019s still a feeling that there\u2019s more to come. We\u2019ve not quite seen the best of Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann. But N\u2019Golo Kante has been outstanding \u2014 not just doing defensive work but carrying the ball 30 yards from midfield. He\u2019s had a superb World Cup.\n\nFrance are favourites today. Croatia did so well to stay in the game on Wednesday and then come again, with Luka Modric, who couldn\u2019t get a kick in the first half, but was supreme after the break. England should have troubled them more, and I suspect a better France midfield will.\n\nFor Croatia, a nation of four million, to win would be historic. For France, it would be a powerful response after losing that Euro 2016 final in Paris. I just hope we get an excellent game to cap a very good tournament.", "description": "GLENN HODDLE: It has\u00a0been wonderful to enjoy England again at a major tournament.
