But, Goldman said, the continued drive to squeeze the most value out of animals has had an unintended consequence.\n\n\"What happens is the meat industry starts to hit a bottleneck,\" he said. \"And the bottleneck, in this case, is the animal. There's only so many more animals we can produce on so much land. As we think about scaling protein across the planet, the bottleneck is apparent.\"\n\nRead more: A popular salad chain is ditching beef for good and replacing it with Beyond Meat\n\nGoldman, who is also the cofounder and \"TeaEO emeritus\" of Honest Tea, said that consumers have seen \"diminishing returns\" as the meat industry scrambles to \"lower the costs,\" including controversial measures like relying on artificial measures like hormones to make livestock bigger, quicker to reproduce, or tastier.\n\n\"The consumer doesn't really embrace that in the way that they might just embrace lower costs,\" Goldman said.\n\nThe result? Shoppers have grown hungry for alternative options, spurred on by growing concerns about the ethics and environmental impact of meat consumption and industrial livestock operations.\n\n\"So then the question becomes, 'Well, what are the other options?' Goldman added. \"What other options do we have other than what exists in the meat category?\"\n\nGoldman said that the team at Beyond Meat was particularly inspired by changes in the selection of dairy options. He showed the audience a picture of a dairy aisle from 1985, which was dominated by regular cow milk. Pulling up a recent photo of a dairy aisle, Goldman pointed out the \"proliferation of plant-based options\" that have risen up to snag \"about 13% of the dairy category.\"\n\n\"As consumers wanted more choice, they moved in that direction,\" he said, calling the shift in the meat category a \"profound opportunity\" for plant-based meat alternatives like Beyond Meat.\n\n\"It used to be that manufacturers would produce something, grocery stores would carry it, and the consumer would buy it,\" Goldman said. \"But now with consumers having more power, things are moving in different directions.\"", "description": "\"With consumers having more power, things are moving in different directions,\" Beyond Meat executive chairman Seth Goldman said.", "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d81a7212e22af624a54e662-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
