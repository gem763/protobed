South Korea Justice Chief Offers to Resign After Mass Protests (Bloomberg) -- South Korea\u2019s newly appointed justice minister offered to resign amid widening corruption investigations, the ministry said, dealing a political blow to President Moon Jae-in. Cho Kuk was expected to offer to step down Monday, the Justice\u2019s Ministry's press office said in a statement, just five weeks after Moon decided to go ahead with his appointment over the objections of opposition lawmakers. Cho faced a range of inquiries into issues involving him and his wife, including their children\u2019s university applications and an investment in a private equity fund. While the decision to appoint close confidante Cho delighted the president\u2019s left-leaning base, many South Koreans opposed the move. Tens of thousands of critics have flooded Seoul\u2019s streets in recent weeks, calling for Cho\u2019s resignation. Cho, a former law professor who became a senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, has denied wrongdoing. The probes undermined Cho\u2019s efforts to paint himself as a reformer trying to level the legal playing field for the average citizen.\n\nSouth Korea Justice Chief Offers to Resign After Mass Protests", "description": "South Korea Justice Chief Offers to Resign After Mass Protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC2S00R_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
