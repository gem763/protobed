They obviously don't want that.

Why not?\u201d\n\nWhile she says she does not regret becoming a public figure in the fight against climate change, making herself a political target, she laments the fact that some people have attacked members of her family, including her younger sister.\n\n\u201cWhen they go after others, who are maybe younger,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cWhen they go after my sister, who is, for example, 13 years old, I mean, that is hard.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Greta Thunberg tells Yahoo News that youth climate activists are \"making a difference.\"", "authors": ["David Knowles", "Kayla Jardine"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qCOB3uTf943arzSsHu838A--~B/aD0zMDQwO3c9NDYwMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/aeed85b0-e6e2-11e9-bfdd-b7057e48e164", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
