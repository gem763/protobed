Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nThe tweet left critics, including one sitting Republican congressman, accusing Trump of stoking violence and diminishing the reality of true civil war.\n\n\u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President,\u201d tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a decorated Air Force veteran who served as a pilot in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cThis is beyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTwo Senate Democrats, Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), also condemned the president\u2019s tweet in a back-and-forth in which Murphy described the message as \u201cso frightening.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is going to keep talking like this,\u201d Murphy tweeted, \u201cand some people are going to listen and do what he asks.\u201d\n\nThe idea of an American civil war did not come from Trump directly. Instead, he quoted a high-profile and contentious Texas pastor who has stood with the president since the earliest days of the 2016 campaign.\n\nAD\n\nJeffress, who fronts a megachurch in Dallas that attracts 14,000 worshipers and hosts his own religious television and radio shows, introduced then-candidate Trump at a campaign rally in January 2016. A month later, he gave an impassioned speech in Fort Worth, endorsing Trump, who he said would be a \u201ctrue friend\u201d to evangelical Christians, at a time when many religious conservatives still wavered on whether to support the former Democrat with a scandalous past.\n\nAD\n\nSince then, the pastor has been one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken supporters. He uses the Bible to defend the president\u2019s actions and brushes away allegations of immoral conduct, from extramarital affairs to alleged sexual assault, by emphasizing Trump\u2019s record on filling the judiciary with conservative justices and pushing for policies that limit access to abortion.\n\nHis speeches regularly appear on Fox News, and Jeffress gave a private sermon to the president-elect and his family before Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. He was one of the guests honored by name at a dinner Trump held for evangelical leaders. Trump has shared and replied to Jeffress in the past on Twitter, promoting the pastor\u2019s book releases in 2017 and last January. The pair has appeared together in public on several occasions.\n\nAD\n\nJeffress has called \u201cNever Trump\u201d Christians \u201cabsolutely spineless morons\u201d and compared them to the German Christians in the 1930s who did not try to stop the Nazis. He has called the Mormon Church a \u201ccult,\u201d and personally attacked Republican Mitt Romney over his faith in 2011. He once compared Trump\u2019s border wall to the gates to heaven, because both signify \u201cnot everybody\u2019s going to be allowed in.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSince Democrats began moving toward impeachment last week, Jeffress has repeatedly sounded grim warnings. On Friday, he told Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs, \u201cI really don\u2019t like what\u2019s going to happen to this nation\u201d if impeachment succeeds, adding, \u201cIf he is removed, this country is finished.\u201d\n\nThe Jeffress quote that Trump tweeted Sunday evening is the first time the president has referenced civil war on Twitter. But as The Washington Post\u2019s Greg Jaffe and Jenna Johnson have reported, cable news pundits on both sides of the spectrum have already begun using the term with regularity to describe the nation\u2019s political conflict.\n\nAD\n\nIn America, talk turns to something not spoken of for 150 years: Civil war\n\nIn one notable case in February, former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova on Fox News and Trump critic and political analyst Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC both declared that the U.S. was \u201cin a civil war,\u201d though both pundits later walked back their rhetoric to claim they meant a war of words and ideas. Although it is \u201cnot entirely out of the question,\u201d Stanford University political scientist James Fearon told The Post in March that he dismissed the idea of America being on the verge of a war with itself as \u201cbasically absurd.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from Trump\u2019s tweet or Jeffress\u2019 interview whether he was referencing actual violence as the outcome of an impeachment, but many critics said that the president\u2019s use of the term was troubling. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying the president\u2019s intentions.\n\n\u201cLincoln created the Republican Party and gave his life in order to save the Union. Trump ruined the Republican Party and now threatens to destroy the Union in order to save his job,\u201d tweeted Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.).\n\nSchatz echoed that concern.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reprehensible way to talk and people could get hurt,\u201d Schatz tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now [Trump] will allow the Republican Party to eat itself and will tear the country apart if he thinks it gives him an advantage of any kind.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "\"I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President,\u201d Rep.
