That cautious approach also has drawn fiery opposition backlash against the French Interior Ministry \u2014 including calls for Christophe Castaner, France\u2019s interior minister, to resign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHours after the attack, Castaner told reporters at the scene that the Harpon had \u201cnever presented behavioral difficulties, nor the slightest sign of alarm.\u201d\n\nBut France\u2019s anti-terrorist prosecutor, Jean-Francois Ricard, offered a starkly different portrait in a news conference Saturday.\n\nRicard said Harpon, who had worked as a computer specialist at the police headquarters since 2003, had been in contact with individuals associated with the \u201cradical Salafist movement,\u201d had converted to Islam roughly a decade before, and \u201cadhered to a radical vision of Islam.\u201d\n\nHarpon exchanged 33 text messages with his wife on Thursday morning that had an \u201cexclusively religious connotation\u201d and ended with \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d or \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic, Ricard said.\n\nAD\n\nHe also confirmed earlier reports circulating in French media that the suspect had previously said he understood the motives behind the January 2015 attack on the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, where two Islamist gunmen killed 12 people.\n\nAD\n\nFor now, much of the outrage from Thursday\u2019s stabbings has focused on Castaner and his initial statements.\n\n\u201cEither he knew, and it\u2019s a state scandal, or he didn\u2019t know, and it shows his total incompetence,\u201d Eric Ciotti, a lawmaker with the right-wing Les R\u00e9publicains party, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhich French citizen can think that the Interior Ministry is ensuring his protection with Castaner at its head?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSimilar statements emerged from France\u2019s significantly weakened Socialist party, although most in this camp stopped short of calling for Castaner\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cThe latest information suggests that there has been, at the least, a certain amateurism in the recruitment of Police Prefecture agents and that the information that should have been given was not,\u201d David Habib, a Socialist parliament member, told Le Monde newspaper.\n\nAD\n\nThe suspect used a metal kitchen knife and an oyster knife \u2014 apparently purchased at a nearby shop half an hour before the attack during his lunch break, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe autopsies attest to a scene of extreme violence,\u201d Ricard said.\n\nAD\n\nHarpon fatally attacked two colleagues in his office, then fatally stabbed another colleague in an office nearby on the same floor, Ricard said. On the staircase toward the ground floor, Harpon then fatally stabbed another officer and seriously injured an administrative assistant, whose condition is no longer critical.\n\nHe was then shot and killed by a 24-year-old intern.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhile Washington is checked out, Macron is pushing to lead the Western world\n\nParis police repeatedly use tear gas on day of protests\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "The suspect worked inside the police headquarters for 15 years.", "authors": ["James Mcauley", "Foreign Correspondent Focusing On French", "European Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ESNdK_ThlFM_csMTIXNkYpm3j8g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P6GNLVXHRUI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
