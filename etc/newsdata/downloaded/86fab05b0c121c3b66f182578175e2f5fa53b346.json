Daniels, a Clinton appointee to the federal court in New York, said not only did Homeland Security cut too many procedural corners in issuing the new policy, but he said it appears to violate immigration law itself, and was \u201crepugnant\u201d to the vision of the American dream.\n\nHe issued an injunction blocking the policy, which would have given the government the power to reject immigration applications from someone who was deemed to have used too many social safety net programs or otherwise was likely to end up on the public dole.\n\nJudge Daniels was particularly dismayed by one of the new tests for English proficiency, which studies have shown is a good yardstick for someone\u2019s ability to succeed.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America has no official language,\u201d he scolded. \u201cMany, if not most, immigrants who arrived at these shores did not speak English. It is simply offensive to contend that English proficiency is a valid predictor of self-sufficiency.\u201d\n\nThe policy had been slated to take effect next week, but the judge\u2019s nationwide injunction prevents that.\n\nThe administration had argued that U.S. law has long discouraged admitting immigrants who were likely to end up draining resources by becoming a \u201cpublic charge.\u201d\n\nThe crux of the debate before the court was over what, exactly, that meant.\n\nUnder Clinton-era rules, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services only looked at a few welfare programs to decide if a migrant was likely to become a public charge.\n\nHomeland Security\u2019s new rules expanded the list of benefits that could put someone over the line to include Medicaid, food stamps and public housing. The changes applied chiefly to migrants applying for green cards, or permanent legal status. Their applications could be rejected if they were deemed unlikely to sustain themselves.\n\nHaving an application rejected did not mean deportation. The migrant would be left the immigrant in whatever status he or she had before.\n\nUSCIS had insisted that the welfare use was just one factor \u2014 albeit a very big one \u2014 in determining a migrant\u2019s ability to be self-sufficient.\n\nThe judge, though, said it was the chief factor, and said the law never envisioned that.\n\n\u201cDefendants do not articulate why they are changing the public charge definition, why this new definition is needed now, or why the definition set forth in the rule \u2014 which has absolutely no support in the history of U.S. immigration law \u2014 is reasonable,\u201d Judge Daniels wrote.\n\n\u201cThe rule is simply a new agency policy of exclusion in search of a justification. It is repugnant to the American Dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upward mobility,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
