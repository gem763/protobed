In February, Nice became the first French city to start trialing facial recognition tools in its streets thanks to cameras that scanned the faces of thousands of adults attending a carnival, matching their likenesses against a database of faces as part of a large-scale experiment.\n\nNow, the regional authority that runs schools around Nice is waiting for an opinion from regulators for another first: deploying facial recognition at the entrances of two regional high schools, in an experiment that has led to howls of protest from parents, teachers' unions and privacy activists.\n\nEarlier this year, Europe's data protection authorities warned that facial recognition entails \u201cheightened risks\u201d for fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nAs France's CNIL privacy watchdog deliberates the question \u2014 the cameras are paused pending its opinion \u2014 Nice's surveillance drive under Estrosi is feeding a broader debate about the growing use of facial recognition in public and its effect on civil liberties.\n\nChampioned by security hawks as a crime-fighting tool, the technology has nonetheless been banned in tech-savvy San Francisco, while earlier this month the California Senate outlawed the use of biometric tech for law enforcement amid fears of human rights violations and errors identifying women and minorities.\n\nOn the other extreme, China's deployment of facial recognition tech is opening a window into a world of limitless surveillance. During pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong earlier this year, demonstrators sawed down towers equipped with face-scanning cameras to avoid detection by authorities. Meanwhile, Muslim Uighur minorities in the Chinese hinterland face such constant biometric surveillance that the New York Times has dubbed their region a \"technological prison.\"\n\nEurope, as Nice's example shows, has yet to make up its mind.\n\nWhile the Continent last year passed the world's most stringent privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), security forces enjoy plenty of wiggle room to use facial recognition. \"Experiments\" with the tool have popped up recently in France, Denmark, Germany and the U.K., where a court in August rejected Europe's first major legal challenge against police use of facial recognition.\n\nPrivacy watchdogs are paying close attention. Earlier this year, Europe's data protection authorities warned that facial recognition entails \u201cheightened risks\u201d for fundamental rights and freedoms. But in the absence of tighter rules for authorities, tough-talking leaders like Nice's Estrosi are bound to press ahead.\n\n\u201cNice is one of those towns where political leaders have built their careers by embodying security, by developing city police and video surveillance,\u201d said Laurent Mucchielli, a sociologist and director of research at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), whose work focuses on crime and urban security.\n\n\"Facial recognition is the latest technology gadget that goes with video surveillance.\"\n\n\u2018France\u2019s most heavily watched city\u2019\n\nNice's love affair with high-tech surveillance stretches back nearly a decade \u2014 long before the 2016 terrorist attack that killed 87 people, including the attacker.\n\nIn 2010 Estrosi, a minister under Nicolas Sarkozy, was the first mayor to create a sophisticated video surveillance system with a \u201curban supervision center\u201d in a French town. A longtime advocate of facial recognition, he unsuccessfully asked for government authorization in 2016 to deploy such technologies during the European football championship, before the GDPR existed.\n\n\u201cTechnology is crucially helpful to secure the everyday life of citizens\u201d \u2014 Nice town hall official\n\nToday, the country\u2019s fifth biggest city in terms of population is de facto \u201cFrance\u2019s most heavily watched city,\u201d with more than 2,600 cameras installed on the street \u2014 one for every 128 inhabitants, and an increase of 1,111 percent since 2007.\n\n\u201cTechnology is crucially helpful to secure the everyday life of citizens,\u201d said an official from Nice's town hall.\n\n\u201cSecurity does not only consist of the protection of people\u2019s goods. It extends to a whole panel of dangers\" and can help police officers find \u201ca lost child, a person suffering from Alzheimer's or a wanted person,\" the official added.\n\nDuring the carnival in February, Nice partnered with the Monaco-based cybersecurity company Confidentia, which provided its \"Any Vision\" software free of charge to test the effectiveness of the algorithms. Confidentia did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nUnder the GDPR, Nice did not need prior authorization from the CNIL, although the data protection authority asked for an assessment of the test once it was completed.\n\nDuring the trial, one of the carnival\u2019s entrances was equipped with facial recognition cameras that scanned the volunteers\u2019 faces in real time and matched them with a database. More than 5,000 people agreed to participate. Minors were not allowed to take part.\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s evaluation, obtained by French newspaper Le Monde, two scenarios were tested: a case-by-case control to assess whether people were authorized to access the carnival and more general scanning to detect the presence of specific volunteers in the crowd.\n\nThe experiment was deemed a success by the city authorities. But the CNIL asked for more information to be able to properly assess the test, such as the rates of false positives and false negatives.\n\nEstrosi declined a request for an interview. The City of Nice declined to comment on the experiment and said the mayor would provide a full assessment in the coming weeks. Estrosi is hoping to run for reelection in 2020.\n\nFor digital rights non-profit organization la Quadrature du Net, Estrosi's surveillance drive is handing the keys of the city to tech companies, to the detriment of the citizens' fundamental rights.\n\n\u201cIn the name of a supposedly smarter and safer city, private companies are selling their 'Safe City' projects, with increased surveillance of the urban space, to elected officials who lack imagination,\u201d said Martin Drago, a legal expert at the organization.\n\nNice is an \"emblem\" of that phenomenon, he added.\n\nOutcry in high schools\n\nTesting facial recognition in high schools has proved a harder pill to swallow for Nice's inhabitants.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that the security of our children is not the main goal, but that there are commercial and political interests\u201d \u2014 Laetitia Siccardi, representative of the federation of councils of students\u2019 parents\n\nIn December 2018, the South Region, which has authority over high schools, decided to allow a facial recognition test in two high schools, one in Nice and one in Marseille. The regional body is chaired by Renaud Muselier, a former member of the European Parliament from Les R\u00e9publicains, the same political party as Nice Mayor Estrosi. Muselier did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe project called for the installation of biometric portals in front of Les Eucalyptus high school in Nice and the Amp\u00e8re high school in Marseille. Students who agree to participate in the experiment will fill in consent forms and go through the biometric portal to enter the school.\n\nBut NGOs, teachers' unions and parents are waging a campaign to stop the deployment of the biometric portals. Several organizations filed a suit in February before a court in Marseille to annul the region's decision. The case is ongoing.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that the security of our children is not the main goal, but that there are commercial and political interests,\u201d said Laetitia Siccardi, who represents the federation of councils of students\u2019 parents.\n\nThe experimentation was supposed to begin in September, but hasn\u2019t started yet.\n\n\u201cThe project is on standby while we wait for the CNIL [privacy authority],\u201d said Philippe Albert, the principal of Nice's Les Eucalyptus high school.\n\n\u201cIn France, there is no debate on those technologies and the impact they can have on our rights and freedoms\u201d \u2014 Martin Drago, legal expert at La Quadrature du Net\n\nAccording to the region's decision, the facial recognition test \u2014 part of a \u20ac45 million package to make high schools safer \u2014 aims to streamline student identification, fight identity theft and detect intruders. The technology is provided free of charge by U.S. tech company Cisco, which signed a memorandum of understanding with the region.\n\nGa\u00ebtan Feige, who is in charge of innovation at Cisco France, said the planned system was protective of students' biometric data.\n\n\u201cThe biometric profiles of each student who will have given their consent will be kept temporarily on a database inside the high school,\u201d he said. The students\u2019 personal data, which won\u2019t be transferred to the cloud and will be individually encrypted, will be erased when they decide to stop participating in the test.\n\nThe CNIL will give an opinion about the experiment around mid-October, said Thomas Dautieu, the data protection authority\u2019s director for compliance. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is to determine whether using facial recognition in high schools is justified.\u201d\n\nIf the experiment gets the green light, it will be a first in France.\n\nIn August, the Swedish data protection authority fined a high school under the GDPR because it was using facial recognition, arguing the students\u2019 consent could not be freely given because the school administration has a moral authority over them.\n\n\u2018Outdated\u2019 legal framework\n\nIn Brussels, the European Commission suggested over the summer a future EU-wide legal instrument on goods and services powered by artificial intelligence, including facial recognition.\n\nBut on the national level, La Quadrature du Net's Drago decries a lack of public debate about facial recognition.\n\n\u201cIn France, there is no debate on those technologies and the impact they can have on our rights and freedoms,\u201d he said. \"The GDPR is too vast, too vague, and is not enough,\" he added.\n\nWhile the GDPR applies for the use of facial recognition in high schools, deploying such technology in the context of criminal offenses, for example to track down people sought by the police, requires a decree from the Council of State built on an opinion from the CNIL.\n\n\u201cThe legal framework for facial recognition in public spaces is a bit outdated,\u201d conceded Dautieu from the CNIL. \u201c[Facial recognition] is a growth market and companies are providing their services, but it is high time the legislators dealt with the issue,\u201d he said.\n\nUnlike in California, there is so far little appetite in the French parliament for a ban on facial recognition tools. Instead, MPs have called for a legislative framework on experimentation with such technology.\n\nFor the CNRS's Mucchielli, a legal framework is \"fundamental.\"\n\n\u201cThe development of technologies of control benefits from the weight of a technology myth in the Western psyche: That technology necessarily means progress, and is necessarily more effective than humans,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
