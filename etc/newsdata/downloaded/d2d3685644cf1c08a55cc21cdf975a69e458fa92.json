Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion, the latest animated film to document the adventures of the famous Gaul, is now out in cinemas in the UK, almost nine months after its debut in France. For Louis Clichy, who co-directed the movie with French filmmaker Alexandre Astier, the idea of bringing Asterix\u2019s story outside of the confines of the Hexagon (as France is lovingly known to its own nationals) is a bit of a head-scratcher. On the one hand, it seemed important to make sure the story made sense to an international audience. But on the other hand, the movie\u2019s creators were unwilling to strip the Asterix franchise of its Frenchness \u2013 even if that meant some references would elude international viewers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very chauvinistic,\u201d Clichy says in his native French. \u201cThis was a film first and foremost for people who know Asterix and speak French.\u201d The film, he says, assumes some knowledge of the Asterix franchise, though Clichy took care to remind the audience of its most basic elements (resolute Gauls resist Roman invaders thanks to their druid\u2019s magic potion, which brings them superhuman strength).\n\nBut Clichy and Astier\u2019s refusal to tone down Asterix\u2019s overwhelming Frenchness isn\u2019t just the result of national pride, or a refusal to tailor a beloved French story to an international audience. It\u2019s also a way of preserving the storytelling and the appeal of the original franchise. \u201cIn order to talk about Asterix with the whole planet, you\u2019d have to remind the audience of a lot of things,\u201d Clichy adds \u2013 and that would be boring for those who are already up to date.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWatching the film in English as a French national is an interesting experience. The way I saw it, Asterix and the Secret of the Magic Potion works on several levels \u2013 much like a Pixar movie. There\u2019s the overall plot (the village\u2019s druid Panoramix, or Getafix as he\u2019s called in the English version, realises that retirement is looming and resolves to find a successor with whom he\u2019ll share his secret magic potion recipe), which can be understood by any viewer regardless of their nationality. Then there are specific references that might not be crystal clear to non-French viewers (Pectin, a girl who must pass for a boy in order to be accepted by Panoramix\u2019s fellow druids, is instructed to answer any question that might come her way by making a \u201cpffft\u201d sound with her mouth \u2013 a typically French response that signals a lack of knowledge and/or interest, which isn\u2019t a prominent part of the conversational repertoire outside of France). And to top it all off, there are references that even some French people might miss \u2013 namely to Astier\u2019s series Kaamelott, a retelling of King Arthur\u2019s legend that remains a fan favourite in France but might not be known to younger viewers.\n\nPixar, where Clichy worked for about three years (he animated scenes in Wall-E and Up), has built an entire brand out of releasing movies that are for children on the surface but contain deeper references for adults, without diminishing anyone\u2019s enjoyment. The same applies here: if people miss out on a Kaamelott reference here and there, Clichy says, \u201cit\u2019s no big deal\u201d \u2013 there\u2019s still plenty for them to focus on.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

After all, aren\u2019t Asterix, Obelix and the rest of the Gauls part of a closed-off country whose main goal is to protect its identity against outside influences \u2013 a narrative that takes on additional relevance in Brexit times? \u201cIt\u2019s true that the overall story of Asterix is quite funny vis-\u00e0-vis what\u2019s happening there,\u201d says Clichy \u2013 though he points out that the film\u2019s story, at its core, is that of Panoramix, rather than the diplomacy that has been part of the franchise\u2019s DNA for six decades now.\n\nSo how does one bring a franchise such as Asterix abroad? First, Clichy and Astier (who also partnered on 2014\u2019s Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods) delivered the film in French. Technically, they each had separate tasks, clearly outlined in their contracts, but naturally, boundaries blurred once they started working together. Still, Astier wrote the story and Clichy supervised much of the animation process. Then came the translation part, which was handled for the most part by the producers. Still, Clichy got involved to some extent \u2013 and surprisingly enough, found that some aspects of the film worked better in English than they did in French.\n\nOne such example is Panoramix\u2019s English name, Getafix. In French, Panoramix is derived from the word \u201cpanoramique\u201d, which means (shocker) \u201cpanoramic\u201d \u2013 a cute pun, but not the wittiest imaginable. Getafix, however, takes on a whole other dimension when it\u2019s applied to a character whose main skill is to make a superhuman strength potion \u2013 in other words, a doping product. \u201c[The name] is so much better in English than in French,\u201d says Clichy. \u201cIt\u2019s very funny. I find it really amusing. Some things do work better in English than in French.\u201d\n\nQuality puns aren\u2019t the English-speaking world\u2019s only contribution to Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion. Clichy\u2019s time at Pixar came into play when it came to crafting the film\u2019s story, too. In the world of American animation, Clichy says, \u201cstory is king\u201d. \u201cYou really have to make sure the story works, even if it means having to do things again, or if it means getting rid of a good joke that doesn\u2019t serve the story,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s their logic. Overall, they have incredible skills that have helped me enormously.\u201d\n\nClichy, an animation man through and through, isn\u2019t fond of Asterix\u2019s past live-action incarnations. There have been four so far, released between 1999 and 2012. \u201cBy default, I don\u2019t like live-action adaptations of comic books. You lost everything. You have to paste human features on things that aren\u2019t supposed to be human.\u201d Only one of the four live-action films, the 2002 Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra (a classic reference for French people born in the Nineties), finds favour with him. \u201cLike everyone else, it made me laugh\u2026 I find all the other ones very bad.
