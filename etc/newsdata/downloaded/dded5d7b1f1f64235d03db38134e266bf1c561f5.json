Mulvey had published a few papers on bacteria that cause UTIs, and patients were frequently emailing him for help. \u201cI always feel bad,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I feel very unable to help them.\u201d But Mann was unusually persistent\u2014as well as unusually nice, Mulvey says\u2014and the relationship turned into a multiyear, single-patient study. Over a period of five years, Mulvey and his collaborators collected and sequenced urine samples from Mann when she got UTIs.\n\nAll of Mann\u2019s UTIs during that five-year period turned out to originate from a single strain of E. coli known as ST131, commonly found in drug-resistant UTIs. But where was Mann getting the same strain from over and over again? The team decided to sequence Mann\u2019s fecal samples too, and found a match: The bacteria causing her UTIs were also hiding out in her gut.\n\nRead: When gut bacteria betray their hosts\n\nResearchers debate whether bacteria that cause recurrent UTIs come from the bladder or the gut, says Felicia Lane, a urogynecologist at UC Irvine who was not involved in the study. The study does not rule out the bladder as a reservoir for bacteria, but it does bolster a link between UTIs and the gut microbiome. And the link, if real, points to another way to treat UTIs that has recently gained traction: fecal transplants. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely in need of new treatments,\u201d says Lane, who led a small clinical study on fecal transplants in patients with recurrent UTIs. Lane\u2019s preliminary data on 10 patients found that the fecal transplants reduced UTIs at three months\u2014but they were no silver bullet. The effects seem to wear off at six months, suggesting the gut microbiome might need to be replenished regularly.\n\nThe study also got Mulvey to wonder why the same E. coli are able to survive in Mann\u2019s gut. Whenever she went to the hospital with a UTI, her doctors cultured the bacteria from her urine and tested the bugs against various antibiotics. They prescribed a drug that worked, and her infection would clear. But the genetic data suggest that some E. coli kept surviving in the gut even when Mann\u2019s UTI went away. Mulvey thinks the bacteria may be able to enter dormant states to hide from antibiotics, and targeting this behavior might help treat these recurrent infections.\n\nMann, for her part, has tried everything she can\u2014from the doctor-ordered surgery that separated her colon and bladder wall to cranberry supplements to treatments like colloidal silver, which made her doctors wary. She\u2019s not alone in her frustration. The failure of antibiotics and the lack of approved alternatives has driven patients to Facebook groups and Reddit forums, where they discuss unapproved cures such as apple cider vinegar and essential oils. In one way, drug-resistant recurrent UTIs are a glimpse into an antibiotic-free future.\n\nRead: A bold new strategy for stopping the rise of superbugs\n\nOf course, that world is not so unfamiliar to Mann. \u201cRemember, I was born before antibiotics,\u201d she reminded me at the end of our conversation. (She was born in 1936, and antibiotics only became widely available in the 1940s.) In just the span of her lifetime, antibiotics have gone from a miracle cure to\u2014in some cases\u2014utterly useless.", "description": "Urinary-tract infections were once easy to cure.
