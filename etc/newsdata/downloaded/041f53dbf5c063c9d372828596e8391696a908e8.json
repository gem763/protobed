Reminder: There are 118 days until the Iowa caucuses and 392 days until the 2020 election.\n\nLast week, Bernie Sanders abruptly canceled his upcoming events and postponed an Iowa ad buy after experiencing \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d at a Las Vegas rally and undergoing a procedure \u2014 the insertion of two stents \u2014 to treat partial blockage of his coronary arteries. Three days later, under persistent questioning from the press, Sanders\u2019 campaign disclosed that he\u2019d suffered a heart attack. He hasn\u2019t returned to the trail since.\n\nIt\u2019s likely just a matter of time before the candidate resurfaces. Staffers insist he will compete in next Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, and Sanders told his people on a Monday conference call that he feels \u201cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u201d The same day, he was seen taking a walk with his wife.\n\nThe real question is whether his campaign can recover.\n\nIn the days following Sanders\u2019 hospitalization, pundits have obsessed over a single theme, claiming, as CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza recently put it, that the episode \u201cthrusts a tough issue to the front of the 2020 presidential race: How old is too old to be president?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Age Only a Number, Even When You\u2019re Running for President?\u201d asked the New York Times, noting that if elected, Sanders, now 78, would be the oldest president in U.S. history by a large margin, as would Joe Biden (77 in November).\n\n(Ronald Reagan, who holds that distinction now, was 77 when he left the presidency at the end of his second term.)\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not helpful to have the entire media reminding voters that you\u2019re a senior citizen, especially at a time when only three percent of Democrats tell pollsters that the optimal age for a president is someone in their 70s. Any vulnerability that makes a candidate appear less likely to defeat Donald Trump \u2014 priority number one for Democrats, according to every poll ever \u2014 is liable to do some damage.\n\nThe bigger problem for Sanders, however, is that he didn\u2019t enter this crisis from a position of strength. In fact, even before his heart attack it was already getting hard to see how he could win the Democratic nomination.\n\nConsider the national polling. Prior to Biden\u2019s official campaign launch, about a quarter of Democratic primary voters backed Sanders, considerably below the 43 percent of the vote he won in the two-person 2016 Democratic primary contest. But that was to be expected in a much bigger field. The next closest candidate was Kamala Harris, down around 8 percent.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

Almost immediately, the former vice president shot up above 40 percent. Sanders plummeted to 14. The way the Democratic primary works, a candidate needs to capture at least 15 percent of the vote to secure any delegates; above that threshold, delegate allocation is proportional. Sanders would claw his way back above 15 percent from time to time, but he never again cracked 20; his base, in other words, was shrinking, not growing. Even when Biden\u2019s initial bounce dissipated, Sanders didn\u2019t tick up in the polls. Meanwhile, every time another candidate had a \u201cmoment\u201d \u2014 think Kamala Harris attacking Biden over busing and segregation during the first round of Democratic debates \u2014 Sanders would slip back below 15 percent.\n\nWhich brings us to Bernie\u2019s latest headache: Elizabeth Warren. Since June, the Massachusetts senator has been the only candidate to rise steadily in the polls. At first, her gains didn\u2019t seem to come at Sanders\u2019 expense, even though the two candidates overlap ideologically. But in recent weeks that appears to have changed. In late September, Warren stood at 21.5 percent, on average; Sanders trailed her by four. Today, she\u2019s basically tied with Biden at 26 percent, and Sanders has fallen to 14.", "description": "Last week, Bernie Sanders abruptly canceled his upcoming events and postponed an Iowa ad buy after experiencing \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d at a Las Vegas rally and undergoing a procedure \u2014 the insertion of two stents \u2014 to treat partial blockage of his coronary arteries.
