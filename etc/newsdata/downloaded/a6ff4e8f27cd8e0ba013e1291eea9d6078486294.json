However, it is increasingly clear that divisions over Brexit and our future relationship with the EU-27 will dominate and define domestic politics for many years to come.\u201d\n\nHe said his preference for ruling out a no-deal Brexit and his support for revoking article 50 in order to restart the two-year clock and give negotiations more time put him at odds with Boris Johnson\u2019s government.\n\nHe said he would support the deal Johnson agreed on Thursday.\n\nField was been suspended from his role as a minister at the Foreign Office by Theresa May after the Mansion House incident but was allowed to retain the Conservative party whip.\n\nWhen he took over as prime minister, Johnson sacked Field from his ministerial role but also dropped a Whitehall investigation into the manhandling of the protester, Janet Barker.\n\nChuka Umunna, the former Labour MP, had said he would stand in Field\u2019s seat for the Liberal Democrats at the next election. He told the i newspaper last month that he felt he was a better option for the constituency because of his \u201cliberal values\u201d and opposition to Brexit.\n\nField held the seat with a majority of around 3,000 in 2017.", "description": "Tory MP for Cities of London and Westminster blames \u2018fractious and febrile\u2019 atmosphere over Brexit", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f64f53c39eb9aaffe1a03739e8615933981b010a/0_41_2310_1386/master/2310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15cb63a1a4f54f1edd6ec5fe3ee046a8", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
