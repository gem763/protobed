Peter Braig\n\n\"I think it's good that companies like [Investa and Gwynvill Group] are supporting Australian architects in their own right to do those kind of international quality projects. We're in the city, we know the issues. And we like to think we respond to them very well,\" he added.\n\nFrancis-Jones Morehen Thorp, another of the local firms invited to submit a design for the site, also pursued a proposal solo. Bates Smart submitted its proposal with New York firm Thomas Phifer and Partners, and Fitzpatrick and Partners paired up with London-based David Chipperfield.\n\nThe completion of the project coincides with a recent Architecture Symposium event that saw local architects come together to examine how Australian cities and good design could engage with a global community while maintaining the nuances of local context.\n\nInvesta chief executive Michael Cook, who in the early 2000s also commissioned London-based Sir Norman Foster to design the Deutsche Bank Place next door, said when the two architecture firms approached him to say they \"wanted to go it alone\" he thought it was a \"risky\" approach.\n\nMr Cook said famous international architects could certainly help to build the profile of a precinct or a specific building and attract global companies in particular \u2013 as was the case with Deutsche Bank Place \u2013 looking for quality offices who \"might not have heard of Joe Smith architects from Surry Hills but know Skidmore, Owings and Merrill\".\n\n\"At the time it was really important,\" he said. \"The Foster brand was really strong, it was the most prolific. It put the building on the map ... and if you were dealing with countries with companies that had European links, as soon as you said Foster it was like a door-opener.\"\n\n\"But what I've found is that the Australian architects working in Melbourne, Sydney and in Brisbane, they've lifted their game and they're all good enough to be working anywhere in the world. And that's what's happening at the moment.\"", "description": "A bold decision by local architecture firm Hassell could have jeopardised its chances of being chosen to design Sydney's newest $1 billion office tower.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b85f8a20d14ae1eba379953b356376fea81c1988", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
