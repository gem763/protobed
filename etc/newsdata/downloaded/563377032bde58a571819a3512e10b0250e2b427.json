Lucky baby.\n\nIf it\u2019s loved anywhere near as much as Sheridan loves her dogs, it\u2019ll be one of the most cherished \u00adchildren ever to enter this funny old world. Woof!\n\nPlus I reckon mum\u2019s a bit of alright too \u2013 a lovely lady for whom family has always been everything.\n\nMuch has been made of the fact, though, that the much-loved actress is having her first baby at the ripe old age of 38. Ripe? Cheek! Ripe\u2019s a good thing. Just ask a banana.\n\nOld? There\u2019s nothing wrong with a bit of maturity. I\u2019m still looking for mine and I\u2019m well past my 30s, which was definitely, without doubt, the best decade of my life.\n\nLife is only just beginning to take a progressive grip in the third decade. All that teen angst done, the studying for qualifications ticked off, an \u00adestablished career to be proud of achieved.\n\nA life partner secured. What else is there to look forward to other than retirement, or perhaps a dog?\n\nSheridan is not an old mama, she\u2019s in the prime of her life, as anyone who\u2019s seen her on stage will testify. This is a woman who\u2019s been there, done that, with a career that has reached the highest pinnacles.\n\nBy the time I hit 38 I\u2019d worked hard since the age of 11, told my parents I was never going to have children, got the job of my dreams on the GMTV sofa, married a colleague and, bang on 38, had my first son.\n\nI was 41 when I had my second and, by then, was coping with two parents with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease . My only regret, though, is that my boys\u2019 \u00admemories of my lovely mum and dad is of them both being demented.\n\nStill, I reckon 38\u2019s a brilliant age to have a baby, even taking into account the fact that the menopause and teenagers are not the happiest of bedfellows. It keeps you young, it keeps you current. At 38, as Frank Sinatra once crooned, The Best is Yet to Come...\n\nDaily Mirror news", "description": "Much has been made of the fact that the much-loved actress is having her first baby at the ripe old age of 38.
