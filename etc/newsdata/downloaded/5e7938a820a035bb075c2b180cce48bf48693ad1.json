The rally on Sunday was billed partly as a show of support for the city\u2019s ethnic minorities.\n\nRiot police officers fired tear gas on the demonstrators less than an hour after the rally began, and there was a heavy police presence in the area well into the night.\n\nThe rally on Sunday was unauthorized and came a day after a local court issued a temporary order that bans the harassment of police officers.", "description": "Demonstrators were expressing support for South Asians in the city, a week after the police sprayed stinging dye at a mosque.", "authors": ["Mike Ives", "Alexandra Stevenson", "Katherine Li"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/world/27hongkong02/27hongkong02-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
