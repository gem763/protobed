The iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) jumped 1.8% on Monday while the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) dropped 1.7%. Data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group showed this was momentum's worst daily performance relative to value since its inception in early 2013.\n\nThe value fund rose again Tuesday, closing 1.4% higher while the momentum fund dropped another 1.5%. The momentum fund was also headed for its third straight decline.\n\nThis shift is unnerving to investors because momentum stocks, those defined by their large growth expectations relative to the broader market, have outperformed value names in recent years. A rotation away from these stocks could result in a downturn for the broader market.", "description": "Value stocks \u2014 those with low multiples and stable fundamentals \u2014 significantly outperformed their growth counterparts on Monday.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106121574-1568121547247preview.jpg?v=1568121560", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
