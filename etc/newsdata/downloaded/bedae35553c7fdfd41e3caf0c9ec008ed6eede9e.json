Sign up for the Balance of Power newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on Twitter and Facebook for more.\n\nFar from the arcane drama at Westminster, warning signs are flashing that Boris Johnson\u2019s path to leaving the European Union carries peril for the integrity of the U.K. itself.\n\nThe prime minister won a fleeting victory in Parliament last night when MPs indicated their support for his renegotiated Brexit deal, only to balk at fast-tracking it into law.\n\nBut Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists are outraged at the deal\u2019s provisions for the province to be treated under a different set of customs rules from the rest of the U.K. The pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party unanimously opposed the accord yesterday.\n\nThey\u2019re in rare agreement with the Irish nationalists of Sinn Fein: Both see it as weakening the union and edging Irish reunification closer to reality. Prominent loyalist Jamie Bryson forecast \u201can organic explosion of anger\u201d if Johnson\u2019s deal is passed.\n\nIn Scotland, where a majority voted in 2016 to remain in the EU, the nationalist government is angry at not being awarded the same tailor-made customs arrangement as Northern Ireland. It is redoubling calls for a second referendum on independence.\n\nJohnson will push for an election to try to break the deadlock in Parliament \u2014 and the momentum is with him. He may yet win his Brexit, but the price may be losing the union.\n\nGlobal Headlines\n\nStrained loyalty | Donald Trump\u2019s self-inflicted crises are testing the Republican senators the president will be counting on in an impeachment trial that lawmakers in both parties now see as all but inevitable. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step yesterday of criticizing Trump by name (for his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria) and called the president\u2019s description of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as a lynching \u201can unfortunate choice of words.\u201d\n\nRead about how the acting U.S. envoy to Ukraine\u2019s explosive testimony to House investigators yesterday has damaged Trump\u2019s defense and left Secretary of State Michael Pompeo in a tough spot.\n\nHappening today: Impeachment investigators will hear from Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense.\n\nCompeting for influence | Fresh from striking a Syria deal with Turkey, Russian President Vladimir Putin is turning his attention to the contest for geopolitical influence in Africa. He\u2019s hosting leaders of more than 50 African states in Sochi today at Russia\u2019s first summit with the continent. Moscow is trying to regain lost ground in Africa after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, though it now trails far behind powers such as China.\n\nManagement change? | The Chinese government is considering a plan to replace Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader next year, a pro-establishment lawmaker said, in a potential strategy shift as demonstrations continue to rock the Asian financial center. Following through would be risky for President Xi Jinping\u2019s Communist Party since there\u2019s no guarantee it would do anything other than embolden the protesters demanding direct elections.\n\nOn the outs | Trump has been privately testing the idea of replacing his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. As Saleha Mohsin and Jennifer Jacobs report, Trump said to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in front of a roomful of staff about a month ago: You have such great ideas, why don\u2019t you be my chief? He has made similar remarks about Chris Liddell, a deputy chief of staff, and asked advisers whether his counselor Kellyanne Conway would be good for the role.\n\nLate last night, Trump responded on Twitter, saying, \u201cWrong, never even discussed this with Kellyanne Conway or Steve Mnuchin. Just more Fake News!\u201d\n\nOpposition meltdown | Policy splits between white and black leaders and months of infighting have left South Africa\u2019s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, on the brink of an implosion. As Antony Sguazzin reports, that\u2019s giving the ruling African National Congress breathing room as it attempts to recover its popularity following the scandal-ridden nine-year rule of Jacob Zuma.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nMark Zuckerberg plans to defend Facebook\u2019s Libra project before a congressional panel, saying the cryptocurrency won\u2019t be launched without approval from the U.S. government, even as the social-media giant\u2019s Washington lobbying strategy is faltering. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera unveiled a series of social measures designed to appease protesters who have brought major cities to a near standstill in the past five days. Ethiopian authorities are probing missing funds a military contractor already accused of graft was meant to spend on a showpiece Nile tributary dam that\u2019s raised tensions with Egypt. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi and Nobel Peace Prize-winning Ethiopian premier Abiy Ahmed are due to discuss the dispute while in Russia today.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox every day?\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for the\u00a0Balance of Power\u00a0newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for more.Far from the arcane drama at Westminster, warning signs are flashing that Boris Johnson\u2019s path to leaving the European Union carries", "authors": ["Alan Crawford"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AO6bjYfBng11TAdLRqQd2A--~B/aD02NjU7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/3fe63f7ba18cb2a52a25e599322d60e2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
