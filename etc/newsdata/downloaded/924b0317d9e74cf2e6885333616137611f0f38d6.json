That\u2019s on top of the 12,000 it already has permission to launch. Why so many? SpaceX says that it\u2019s about ensuring its network can meet anticipate demand \u201cresponsibly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs demand escalates for fast, reliable internet around the world, especially for those where connectivity is non-existent, too expensive or unreliable, SpaceX is taking steps to responsibly scale Starlink\u2019s total network capacity and data density to meet the growth in users\u2019 anticipated needs,\u201d wrote a SpaceX spokesperson in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.\n\nThe ITU filing doesn\u2019t mean SpaceX is launching 30,000 satellites tomorrow: In fact, the company is looking to launch likely only a few hundred in the coming year. But SpaceX is anticipating big increases in the demand for low-latency and high-capacity broadband globally, and its initial deployment plans only cover a fraction of that demand. Plus, given the increased interest in providing communications from orbit, there\u2019s bound to be a growing rush on spectrum over the next few years.\n\nStarlink will originally set out to provide service in the northern U.S., as well as parts of Canada, beginning as early as next year when the network goes live. The plan is to then scale the network to global coverage over the course of around 24 launches of Starlink satellites. It\u2019s betting that it\u2019ll need to scale by adding on nodes opportunistically to address demand, especially since most current coverage demand models don\u2019t take into account regions that are getting broadband access for the first time.\n\nSpaceX is also priming Starlink for high-traffic operation (though the total constellation won\u2019t all be operating in the same orbital region, it\u2019ll still be a considerable addition to the orbital population relative to the roughly 8,000 objects that have been launched to space to date \u2013 in total). The measures SpaceX is taking to deal with traffic include building in automated collisions avoidance systems, structure de-orbiting plans, information sharing about orbital routes for their satellites and more, and the company says it\u2019s meeting or exceeding the industry standards that have been established thus far around this.\n\nTo address the concerns of astronomers, SpaceX is also turning the base or Earth-facing portion of all future Starlink satellites back, which should help address concerns of space watchers who are concerned about the impact that large constellations will have on stellar observation and research. The company will also take steps to adjust satellite orbits where it\u2019s shown that its constellation is impeding serious scientific pursuit.\n\nStarlink launched its first 60 satellites back in May, and the plan is that each roughly 500 lb satellite will work in tandem with the others to communicate with ground stations that end users will then be able to connect to in order to get a broadband network signal.", "description": "SpaceX has filed documents with the International Telecommunication Union, which governs international use of global bandwidth, to launch up to 30,000 more satellites for its Starlink global broadband constellation, SpaceNews reports.
