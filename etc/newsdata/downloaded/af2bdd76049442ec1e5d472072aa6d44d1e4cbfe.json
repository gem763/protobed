By contrast, the average across the states and territories was 4.5 domestic visitors per resident.\n\nThe accommodation sector is not as buoyant elsewhere, with hoteliers in Brisbane struggling to fill beds after an increase in supply over the past couple of years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData from industry intelligence firm STR shows an occupancy rate of 71 per cent in Brisbane for the year to August \u2013 the second lowest out of the eight capital cities, after Darwin.\n\nBy contrast, Sydney topped the capitals with an 82.5 per cent occupancy rate over the same period, according to STR.\n\nCanberra's success in attracting international tourists has been primarily driven by a rise in the number of flights heading directly to the city from international gateways.\n\n\"Singapore Airlines started in September 2016 [and] Qatar Airways began in 2017, so they've both been flying for three years and sort of two years effectively,\" Mr Barr said.\n\n\"And Singapore Airlines initially started with four flights a week and they've now moved to a daily service.\"\n\nThis meant visitors could fly to Canberra from several European and Asian cities with only one stop such as Singapore or Doha, he said.\n\nSimilarly, new Tiger Airways services from Melbourne and Brisbane have introduced cheap airfares for local visitors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowth from South Asia\n\nFor the ACT and a number of the states, China remains the largest source country for international visitors, accounting for 16 per cent of all arrivals in August.\n\nHowever, the ABS data released this week confirmed the growing importance of arrivals from South Asia.\n\nThe year-on-year increase in visitor numbers from India was 17.5 per cent, which meant the country continued as the highest source of growth.", "description": "Canberra is now on the radar for a growing number of overseas visitors, but finding accommodation in the city during peak season can be difficult.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2163%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/41fa46eb86d7b015ddde06be362e259d96d56808", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
