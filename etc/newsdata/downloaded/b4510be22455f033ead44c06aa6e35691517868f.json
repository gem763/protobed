Slater rose to prominence in the 1970s as a businessman and financier, who was the founding Chairman of Slater Walker, an investment bank and conglomerate. As a corporate raider in the 1960s and 1970s he grew his investment vehicle Slater Walker to be worth more than \u00a3200m, only to see his empire implode during the mid-1970s property and banking crash. He went on to rebuild his fortune. But among private investors, he was best known as a stock market guru, both as a spectacularly successful share tipster for The Times (in the two years from the launch of his column in 1963, his tips gained nearly 70%, compared to less than 4% for the wider market, reports The Daily Telegraph) and as a writer of several books on investing, most notably The Zulu Principle: Making Extraordinary Profits from Ordinary Shares. The Zulu Principle: Making Extraordinary Profits from Ordinary Shares is an investment guide written by Jim Slater and was first published in 1992. He gives valuable selective criteria for buying dynamic growth shares, turnarounds, cyclicals, shells and leading shares in his book. Jim Slater along with his son Mark Slater, launched the MFM Slater Growth Fund in 2005. A relatively concentrated portfolio of between 25 and 50 stocks, primarily UK listed companies. The fund adopts the \u2018tried and tested\u2019 investment approach based on the Zulu Principle of 20 years ago. Jim Slater was one of the UK's most popular home-grown investors and his strategy is well followed.\n\nDynamic Equities has created a strategy based on his philosophy and has found some great stocks to invest in the Indian Stock market.
