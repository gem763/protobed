The male canine is approximately three-years-old and was surrendered to Birmingham Police before coming into rescue after he was found in a property alongside his sister, Belle. She was re-homed but Blue is still waiting five months later. He had found a home a few months back but was sadly returned to the rescue just a few days after. Blue is full of life and character and has lots of energy\n\nAvalanche (left) and Jess (right), two ten-year-old Siberian Huskies, currently live at the Saints Sled Dog Rescue in Peterborough. They have been in rescue for three years and are looking for a new home together. The female canines lived in a small pen for seven years without any human socialisation and they were feral when they arrived in rescue. They still will not allow a lead to be walked but love all dogs and feel safe around them\n\nBuster is between two and three years old and is being kept at Lizzie's Barn Animal Sanctuary in Carmarthenshire. The dog is a male Whippet cross Greyhound who has been in rescue for almost 500 days. He is affectionate and tactile and is looking for a new home because of his owner\u2019s health and housing issues. He loves everyone, but is unsure of very young children with whom he has very little experience\n\nSampson is an eight-year-old Alaskan Malamute who is being looked after at Saints Sled Dog Rescue in North West Cheshire. The canine has been waiting for a new home for ten months and just wants a home to cuddle up in and an owner who will take him on nice slow walks. He needs an only dog home without children under 13 and loves his playtime with tennis balls. Due to his long coat Sampson isn\u2019t keen on being groomed for long periods of time\n\nTimmy is an almost five-year-old Collie Pointer cross who is being looked after by the D.O.G. Rescue Cyprus in Atherstone, in Warwickshire. The dog is friendly, affectionate and playful and loves his food and mealtimes. Timmy first came into rescue in 2014, where he spent two years in kennels in Cyprus before a UK dog lover sold her jewellery to fund his travel to the UK. He has spent short periods in foster homes over the last three years but spends most of his time in kennels and is becoming increasingly depressed. The rescue would be willing to consider a long-term foster home for him to get him out of kennels as soon as possible\n\nBilly and Lola currently reside at the Rosina Animal Centre in Kent. They are two-year-old Chihuahuas who are looking for a new home together after their owner sadly passed away. They must be kept together and be the only pets in their new home. They could, however, live with older children. Billy is very laid back and Lola is slightly nervous and will need plenty of love to help her settle\n\nBasil is a six-year-old cross-breed who came to the UK from Romania and currently lives at K-9 Angels in Stoke on Trent. The dog has been in the kennels for almost a year and is looking for a female owner (or owners). Basil adores his squeaky toys and gives amazing cuddles and kisses! He loves gentle quiet walks where he can explore and sniff, but equally well would adore time in a safe garden. Sadly Basil cannot live with men, children, or other furries, however, he would happily say hello to men when he is outside his home environment\n\nOlive is a two-year-old female Basenji cross who is living at Animal Adoption International in Portsmouth. The dog was attacked with a machete while minding her own business in Thailand but was rescued and taken to safety. Olive struggled when she first arrived but with patience and love she has come through. She is cheeky and fun and would be best placed with older children who will understand her needing time to settle in\n\nBoris is an eight-year -old Staffie who is being kept at the Staffie and Stray Rescue, based in Bournemouth in Dorset. The dog has had a terrible start to his life as a result of irresponsible pet ownership. He tragically lost both his eyes in a house fire and therefore will require a patient and understanding home. He would like a home where someone is around a lot of the time to assist him. Despite his trauma, he is a happy chap and loves to snuggle up wherever he can\n\nThe national campaign has been backed by Good Morning Britain presenter Charlotte Hawkins (pictured)", "description": "Following the launch of the first National Dog Adoption Day earlier this month, charities and shelters in the UK have been sharing the pictures of abandoned dogs in their care.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/16/20337320-0-image-a-51_1572367688261.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
