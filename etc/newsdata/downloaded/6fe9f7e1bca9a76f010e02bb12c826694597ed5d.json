REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro\n\nA court in the eastern city of Multan found Muhammad Waseem guilty of the murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment, his lawyer told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWaseem has been given life in prison,\u201d the lawyer, Sardar Mehboob, told Reuters by phone after the verdict was delivered.\n\n\u201cIt is for sure that we will appeal in the High Court.\u201d\n\nSix others accused of involvement have been acquitted, the lawyer said. They included two of Baloch\u2019s other brothers, her cousin, a neighbor, a driver, and a Muslim cleric.\n\nWaseem admitted in a 2016 media conference organized by police that he strangled his 26-year-old sister due to her social media activities.\n\nBaloch had posted risque Facebook posts in which she spoke of trying to change \u201cthe typical orthodox mindset\u201d of people in Pakistan. She faced frequent misogynist abuse and death threats but continued to post provocative pictures and videos.\n\nBaloch, whose real name was Fauzia Azeem, was described as Pakistan\u2019s Kim Kardashian and had built a modeling career on the back of her social media fame, but drew ire from many in the conservative South Asian nation.\n\nHer killing sent shockwaves across Pakistan and triggered an outpouring of grief on social media, and prompted the government to tighten laws to ensure that killers would not walk free if family members forgave them.\n\nLocal media had reported in August that Waseem\u2019s parents had forgiven their son and asked for him to be acquitted. Reuters was unable to reach them for comment.\n\nHundreds of women are killed each year in Pakistan by family members over perceived damage to \u201chonor\u201d that can involve eloping, fraternizing with men or any other infraction against conservative values that govern women\u2019s modesty.\n\nWomen\u2019s rights experts say that enforcement of justice is often lax, with proceedings at times being drawn out while accused killers were freed on bail and cases faded away.\n\n\u201cIt takes too long, people forget,\u201d said Farzana Bari, a women\u2019s rights advocate and founder of Pakistan\u2019s first gender studies department at a university, adding that even the high-profile Baloch case had taken over three years to be resolved.\n\nThough rights groups say reliable data is hard to establish, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan found at least 300 cases of \u201chonor killing\u201d in 2018.\n\nMany advocates say the actual number is far higher, with the Honour Based Violence Awareness Network estimating that Pakistan accounts for about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings globally each year.", "description": "A Pakistan court on Friday convicted the brother of social media star Qandeel Baloch of her murder, a 2016 killing that sparked a change in laws and ignited fierce debate over the prevalence of 'honor killings' of women.", "authors": ["Mubasher Bukhari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434468394&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0ET", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
