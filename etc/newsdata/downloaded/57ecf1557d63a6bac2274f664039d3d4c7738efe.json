Students name what they want to see on the menu", "language": "en", "text": "As a foreign student, I find it hard to find food that satisfies my taste buds. I love eating spicy food like Biryani, a Pakistani mixed rice dish. It is full of aromatic spices and I think many students will find the dish as delicious as I do.\n\nFarooq Kainat, 17, HKTA The Yuen Yuen Institute No. 3 Secondary School\n\nI\u2019d add a vegetarian option. Although it probably won\u2019t be a popular choice among students, I still think it\u2019s necessary. All school canteens should have at least one option for vegetarian students. Even if none of the students were vegetarian, it would be good to have an option that is nutritious and less harmful to the environment than meat dishes.\n\nYau Kin Long, 16, Fung Kai Liu Man Shek Secondary School\n\nDead bugs, plasticky taste, a Band Aid: you won't believe what our readers have eaten at their schools' canteens\n\nI wish our canteen served sushi. Many students have other things to do during their lunch break and don\u2019t have time for a proper sit-down meal. Sushi already comes bite-sized, and can be eaten quickly or even on the go.\n\nAriel Tang, 14, Sacred Heart Canossian College\n\nI\u2019d add veggie burgers because vegetables are good for us. Many students don\u2019t enjoy eating vegetables, but they might be more willing to if it came in the form of a burger. If they still don\u2019t like the taste of the veggie patty, they can add their favourite sauces to it to make it tastier.\n\nSam Liang, 15, Scientia Secondary School\n\nI think sushi would be a popular option to have. Plus, sushi rolls can be filled with just about anything. Aside from the standard salmon and crab meat sushi, we can have beef and chicken sushi for those who don\u2019t like seafood, or vegetable-filled sushi for vegetarians.\n\nTrinity Woo Cheuk Nam, 11, St Rose of Lima\u2019s college\n\nSushi was a popular request for students.

My favourite types are Yangzhou and Hokkien fried rice. I hope my canteen would serve both.\n\nPang Wing-ho, 18, Immaculate Heart of Mary College\n\nI\u2019d love it if my school canteen would have a soup of the day. I love many kinds of soup, particularly carrot and mushroom soup. It would be so nice to have a hot bowl of soup for lunch, especially during the colder months.\n\nLee Wai-ting, 12, Immaculate Heart of Mary College\n\nI\u2019d like to add a Thai dish like pad thai or green curry. If my school canteen served Thai food, I would even come during the weekends for lunch!\n\nYoonjung Choi, 14, Hong Kong International School.\n\nTalking Points: what\u2019s the worst dish in your school canteen?\n\nI\u2019d definitely add beef with rice to the menu. This dish is a good source of protein and iron, and is also very tasty! It\u2019s one of my favourite dishes.\n\nNatalie Lin, 12, Henrietta Secondary School\n\nI\u2019d like to add fish ball noodle soup to my school\u2019s canteen menu. It is healthier than fried food, but is still filling and can give students enough energy to get through the rest of the school day. It is a signature Hong Kong dish, and I think school canteens should offer more local food.\n\nRosanna Tung, 14, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nI wish we could have a special dish from a different country each week so that students could have the chance to taste some dishes they\u2019ve never tried before. It will encourage students to try new things and might inspire them to want to travel more.\n\nJacky Leung, 14, Ng Yuk Secondary School", "description": "From veggie burgers to sushi, here's what teens want to see at school.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/7e6e95bc-dfa0-11e9-94c8-f27aa1da2f45imagehires122954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
