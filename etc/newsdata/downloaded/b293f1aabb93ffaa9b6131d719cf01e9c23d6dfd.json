For now, any talk of constraints on new supply or higher consumption as the world\u2019s cities expand is drowned out by worries about sagging demand fueled by the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nIt\u2019s a dramatic shift from a year ago, when just about everyone in the industry was bullish on the metal used in pipes and wires.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals for the market are very positive in the short-, mid- and long-term, but the mood is not that great,\u201d Targhetta said in an interview. \u201cWe keep hoping and expecting that when the uncertainties clear up, it will jump in a vivid way.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what the metals world was saying about copper this time last year\n\nAt about $5,900 a ton, London Metal Exchange copper is near the bottom of a tight range it\u2019s held since the trade war broke out in mid-2018. Mounting evidence of a consequential collapse in manufacturing output has helped to keep a lid on prices even as supply issues stack up.\n\nThe gloomy sentiment at this year\u2019s LME Week isn\u2019t limited to copper. Commodities consultancy CRU Group on Tuesday offered a downbeat assessment of the prospects for industrial metals in the coming year. Global demand will drop this year for copper, aluminum, zinc and lead, according to CRU's estimates.\n\nThere are even doubts that nickel \u2014 the star performer this year \u2014 may struggle to hold its gains in the face of deteriorating demand. Nickel\u2019s rally has been fueled by an expedited ban on raw ore exports from Indonesia, and a sharp drawdown in inventories on the LME. Nickel\u2019s supply shock has been too big for traders to ignore, but they\u2019ve been happier to discount simmering issues in top copper producer Chile, where the worst social unrest in decades has led to disruptions at several major ports and mines.\n\n\u201cThe mood is not that great\u201d\n\nMine supply in the copper market is already constrained, and Freeport will push for a further reduction in the processing fees it pays smelters to reflect that tightness, Targhetta said.\n\nSo-called treatment charges for mined copper concentrates were set at a six-year low of $80.80 per ton of processed ore this year, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see them fall below $70, he said.\n\nCopper ore is becoming harder to find and mine, which means the industry will struggle to meet the world\u2019s needs, Targhetta said.\n\nThere\u2019s also plenty of compelling reasons on the demand side to bet on higher prices, he said.\n\nWhat a Difference a Year Makes: Gloom and Doom at Metals Week\n\nFreeport calculates that the mining industry will need to find an additional 100 million tons of copper over the next two decades to feed rising consumption in renewable energy, electrified transport and urbanization projects, he said.\n\nThat\u2019s about five times current annual output, and isn\u2019t far short of the 160 million tons of additional metal that was needed over two decades to feed China\u2019s unprecedented economic expansion, Targhetta said.\n\nTo contact the authors of this story: Mark Burton in London at mburton51@bloomberg.netJack Farchy in London at jfarchy@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net, Liezel HillNicholas Larkin\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- As head of sales for copper-mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Javier Targhetta overflows with arguments for why the metal\u2019s prospects are bright.Yet even the five-decade metals veteran and copper bull acknowledges the miserable mood seeping through the industry\u2019s annual gathering in", "authors": ["Mark Burton", "Jack Farchy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tOXONh_9zEr0DFAzygT18g--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b4c90e5e4eb95121eca0bfb276ef7708", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
