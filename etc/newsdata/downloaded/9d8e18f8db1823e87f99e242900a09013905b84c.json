A bedside table needs to be small enough to squeeze into the space between the bed and wall (often a challenge), yet we expect it to carry our lives: alarm clock, bedside lamp, reading glasses, notepad, stack of bedtime books... not to mention our morning cup o\u2019 joe, which is why we\u2019ve chosen these small but perfectly formed units for their style as well as all-important functionality.\n\nWith a wealth of design-led pieces around, there\u2019s a bedside table for every homemaker. If you\u2019re a bookworm, look for a nightstand with integrated shelving.\n\nSome styles offer a nifty under-shelf designed to hold our pile of well-thumbed paperbacks. If minimalism\u2019s your thing, plump for a design with deceptively spacious storage to clear the clutter \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t interrupt the clean lines.\n\nWhile some bedside tables come in a set of two, we preferred the versatility of the singular purchase because there\u2019s often only room for one \u2013 a pertinent point if you\u2019re a city-dweller with space at a premium.\n\nOtherwise, you can fill your boots and invest in a matching duo of diminutive tables to suit your style, not forgetting that in the bedroom, symmetry is everything \u2013 especially if you\u2019re going for that flawless hotel look.\n\nOur roundup includes some affordable pieces, as well as those on the higher end of the price bracket (and double that if you\u2019re buying a pair).\n\nBut whatever the cost, we found all of the bedside tables we tested to be both well-crafted and superbly creative in design.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice.

This cute utilitarian unit had us at hello with its cheery hue and petite boxy shaping. Its epoxy finish awards it a plasticky feel \u2013 warmer than the usual cold-to-the-touch metal, and it boasts generous storage to boot.\n\nBuy now\n\nTikamoon pavel acacia bedside table: \u00a3239, Tikamoon\n\nWe loved this little bedside table for its open bureau inspired design. Crafted from warming acacia wood, it brings instant Scandi calm to the bedroom whilst keeping the look clean-lined and contemporary with its black slimline legs. The natural patina of the wood adds to the unique character of this diminutive piece, and best is that it still looks great when cluttered with books and coffee-stained papers. It may be our priciest pick but we\u2019ve fallen for this lovely little writer\u2019s desk in miniature.\n\nBuy now\n\nHabitat oken sage green folding side table: \u00a336, Habitat\n\nSometimes all you need is a surface, and this sweet little side table from Habitat more than does the job. As a contemporary bedside table, it is fresh, stylish and clean-lined. It\u2019s also foldable with a removable tray top, making it a versatile piece you can easily repurpose should you need it for entertaining. We loved its subtle colour and glossy finish, as well as its unobtrusive X-shaped frame that didn\u2019t compromise our floor space.\n\nBuy now\n\nAtkin & Thyme Jensen bedside drawer: \u00a3179, Atkin & Thyme\n\nThere\u2019s industrial, and then there\u2019s soft industrial, and the latter is far better suited to the bedroom. This single drawer on stilts is a design triumph for its simplicity, yet it manages to be utterly glamorous with its glass top and brushed bronze finish. While fully luxe on top, the bedside table has a functional, slimline angular frame in powder-coated black. The stark contrast gives the effect of a floating shelf and cleverly creates the illusion of extra space underneath.\n\nBuy now\n\nOak Furnitureland Hove natural oak and painted bedside table: \u00a3189.99, Oak Furnitureland\n\nThis compact bedside cabinet is made from 100 per cent solid hardwood oak and carries a clean-lined and contemporary aesthetic. We loved its gently curved form as well as its inconspicuous recessed handles that keep the look smooth and stylish. With two generous drawers, we found we could hide all our bits and bobs away \u2013 while keeping them reassuringly close by as we snoozed. Minimal and modern, this one scored high on functionality.\n\nBuy now\n\nRose & Grey left or right webbed cabinet: From \u00a3225, Rose & Grey\n\nThoughtful design allowed us to pick this adorable duo of bedside cabinets with left- or right-opening options. You\u2019ll want the little brass handle closest to your side of the bed, so be sure to choose one of each if you\u2019re ordering a pair. The hinged doors, fronted with boho-inspired cane webbing (an Eighties teen room staple), open to reveal a handy shelf for books, and while the oval shaping of the painted mango wood cabinets doesn\u2019t allow for much on top, it will reliably hold your morning cuppa.\n\nBuy now\n\nOliver Bonas iro white bedside table: \u00a3155, Oliver Bonas\n\nWe\u2019re forever impressed with Oliver Bonas\u2019s furniture offering and its bedside tables are no exception. Inspired by the ornate architecture of Asia, this diminutive side table manages to straddle both vintage and contemporary looks with its crisp white paintwork and decorative carving. Handcrafted from mahogany wood with brass hardware, it\u2019s a solid furniture piece that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in an eclectic, travel-inspired boudoir. Best is its contrasting bright turquoise tassel.\n\nBuy now\n\nArgos Home nomad one drawer bedside chest: \u00a374.99, Argos Home\n\nThis cubic bedside table marries rustic charm with contemporary styling. It\u2019s big on storage too with a deep and generous drawer, an open drawer on top of that (ideal for keeping our favourite tomes to hand), and of course a sturdy surface to place a stylish bedside lamp. The boxy look continues with an angular, modern metal frame. Part of the coordinating nomad collection, we were impressed with Argos Home\u2019s handsome nightstand offering.\n\nBuy now\n\nSwoon Editions Ziggy copper bedside table: \u00a3199, Swoon\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with a flash of Bowie-inspired glamour in the bedroom, which is why we loved this metallic mini cabinet as our nightstand. Intricately crafted from mango wood with a copper foil cladding, and supported by four retro hairpin legs in black, it is one seriously stylish furniture piece. And with its integrated shelf for books, bits and bobs, it\u2019s not just a pretty facade, either. Boxy and beautiful.\n\nBuy now\n\nVerdict: Bedside tables\n\nWe loved Maisons du Monde\u2019s Sunset Universe metal bedside table. It manages a rare feat of being both cute and utilitarian, and with its sunshiny shade, there\u2019s simply no getting out of the wrong side of bed. An industrial locker style nightstand with petite proportions. We were also impressed with Rose & Grey\u2019s duo of webbed cabinets for their thoughtful design and charmingly retro aesthetic.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
