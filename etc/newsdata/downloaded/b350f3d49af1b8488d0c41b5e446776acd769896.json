Lloyds revealed that people in this age group are being tricked out of an average of \u00a33,573 per fraud.\n\nYounger people are thought to be duped at a much faster rate than their peers because of their greater use of online banking, which has increasingly been seized upon by scammers.\n\nBank of Scotland fined \u00a345.5m by regulator over Reading fraud Read more\n\nGreater awareness among older people is also thought to have driven fraudsters to new groups and tactics.\n\nPaul Davis, fraud and financial crime director at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cHelping to keep our customers\u2019 money safe is our number one priority. Being a victim of fraud can have devastating effects not just on people\u2019s finances, but also their lives.\n\n\u201cWhile we are working 24/7 behind the scenes to protect customers and millions of pounds have been frozen, every day fraudsters are trying to trick people into handing over their personal information, like a PIN or password, or transferring cash.\u201d\n\nThe figures come as the bank launches a new multimedia campaign to crack down on scams, including a TV advert that will air from Monday.\n\nDavis added: \u201cOur new campaign will help people to recognise the signs by reminding them that we will never call and ask them to move money to another account. The more we all know about spotting scams, the safer we will all be.\u201d\n\nGareth Shaw, head of money content at consumer group Which?, said: \u201cAnyone of any age can fall victim to a bank transfer scam, as fraudsters use increasingly sophisticated tactics \u2013 and people are losing life-changing sums of money every day as a result.\u201d He added that all banks and payment providers should sign up to a new voluntary code that offers greater protection for their customers and scam victims.", "description": "New figures also show over-55s lose the most money per scam on average", "authors": ["Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18cacf5f24b32df251e9e2f02b1138997a13ace/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e35e5071f78293bc4149a64eaef3342f"}
