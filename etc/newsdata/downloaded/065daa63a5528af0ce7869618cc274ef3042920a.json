(CBC Archives/The National)\n\nParents were being careful to demand kids hand over their loot \u2014 not because they wanted to steal a peanut butter cup, but because they were concerned about tampering.\n\n\"They said we're not allowed to eat anything that's not in a wrapper,\" said a boy in a cowboy costume.\n\nWhy? \"'Cause it's probably got a lot of poisonous stuff in it, I don't know,\" said another boy, dressed as a character that has been lost to time.\n\nThis trick-or-treater said his parents ordered him not to eat any of the candy he collected -- at all. (CBC Archives/The National)\n\nA third said his parents had told him he couldn't eat any candy \u2014 at all.\n\n\"They just told me not to eat it because of all the stuff going around.\"\n\nParental fears about poisoning\n\nThe seemingly unfounded threat of random poisoning by Halloween candy has been a concern for parents for decades, perhaps being cemented by a notorious case in the United States in which a father poisoned his own son.\n\nIn the 1974 case, a boy died after consuming Pixy Stix he had collected on Halloween that were laced with the poison cyanide. However, it was later proven in court that he had been murdered by his own father, who had slipped the tainted candy into his son's loot bag. The father was later executed by lethal injection in Texas.\n\nReporter Terry Milewski found there were a lot of cautious parents who needed to check their kids' Halloween loot. (CBC Archives/The National)\n\nHowever unlikely such a scenario was to occur then or now, Milewski reported in 1982 that fears about Halloween candy were heightened in the aftermath of a series of random poisonings of Tylenol users that same year \u2014 again, a story that occurred in the United States.\n\nA poison control hotline had even been set up at a Toronto children's hospital for trick-or-treat night, but it wasn't ringing much.\n\n\"Nobody called except for reporters, but that's because parents were doing their own poison control,\" said Milewski.\n\nParents said they were being careful.\n\n\"We want our children to bring their goodies home, and then we pile them all on the living-room floor, we go through them, make sure they're all fine,\" said a father on the doorstep.\n\n\"Late tonight there were no reports of anyone being poisoned,\" said Milewski, wrapping up. \"Just scared.\"", "description": "Halloween fell on a Sunday in 1982 and some cities agreed to move the trick-or-treat day to Oct. 30.", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4873604.1540242440!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mansbridge-halloween.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-30"}
