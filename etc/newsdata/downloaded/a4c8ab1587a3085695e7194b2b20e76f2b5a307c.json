The result, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, used data from the UK Biobank and 23andMe.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI\u2019m definitely not a scientist, but I have always been personally uncomfortable with research into the genetics of sexuality. I know some feel it helps dispel the myth that sexuality is a choice. However, I don\u2019t think it will change the way people treat me and there is always a risk in how it might be used, as evidenced by the story I tweeted.\n\nI was 20 when the dog-eared article I posted ran and I\u2019d come out as gay just four months earlier. I was still feeling vulnerable and hadn\u2019t told my parents or brothers.\n\nThe clipping was headlined \u201cAbortion hope after \u2018gay genes\u2019 findings\u201d and included the chilling line: \"It could soon be possible to predict whether a baby will be gay and give the mother the option of an abortion\".\n\nI remember how much the article repulsed me and how angry I felt. Angry about why we were doing this sort of research and at how it had been covered by the paper.\n\nMy post went viral, with thousands of people sharing and liking my tweet and literally hundreds saying they couldn\u2019t believe a newspaper still printed stuff like this in 1993. People were clearly flabbergasted and horrified that it had been written in their lifetime.\n\nHowever, many felt it was an isolated story by a particular conservative paper. Something that didn\u2019t really reflect life in the early 1990s. Not only is that shortsighted, it\u2019s a dangerous rewriting of LGBTQ+ history.\n\nI know that homophobia was still rife in 1993, and it was blatant within our mainstream media. It wasn\u2019t always as vile as the abortion story, but you didn\u2019t need to spend long flicking through a day\u2019s papers to find articles mocking gay people, challenging our right to equality and blaming us for many of the ills of society. In 1994, an MP publicly referred to homosexual activity as \u201cneither natural or normal\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Paris is Burning (1990) While \u201cVogue\u201d was for mainstream consumption, the cult documentary Paris Is Burning went behind the scenes of the glamorous ballroom culture, exploring the darker reality of those outcast and stigmatised by a hostile society. Alamy 6/25 20. Carol and Susan's wedding on Friends (1996) While Friends has often been criticised over its LGBT representation, this was one moment it did get right. Rex Features 7/25 19. Macklemore - Same Love (2012) As a rap song advocating for same-sex marriage, \u201cSame Love\u201d sends a impactful message of support from a traditionally hostile area of the music world. Youtube 8/25 18. Britney and Madonna kiss at the VMAs (2003) An obvious and bizarre publicity stunt, but this split-second snog at the MTV VMAs is surely the most famous same-sex kiss of all time. Getty 9/25 17. The Golden Girls tackle gay marriage (1991) Our beloved Miami foursome weren\u2019t just camp icons \u2013 they were ardent LGBT allies.

An LGBT anthem was born. Youtube 11/25 15. Stephen Fry introduces Grindr on Top Gear (2009) Grindr was brand new when Stephen Fry showed it off to Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, and his estimated global audience of about 350 million.

Ellen DeGeneres comes out (1997) Now the most-high profile lesbian in the world, Ellen took the bull by the horns when she came out in a memorable episode of her sitcom, with a simultaneous cover of Time magazine on which she declared: \u201cYep, I\u2019m gay.\u201d 13/25 13. Queer As Folk (1999) Russel T Davies\u2019s groundbreaking Channel 4 series was unapologetic in its portrayal of gay men and their sex lives, and taught a pearl-clutching British public about rimming.

Boy George on Top of the Pops (1982) When Culture Club appeared on Top of the Pops to perform \u201cDo You Really Want To Hurt Me?\u201d, the androgynous look of its colourful frontman threw viewers and the UK tabloids into a spin. BBC 17/25 9. Lady Gaga - \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (2011) Lady Gaga\u2019s love of the LGBT community, and her status as \"Mother Monster\" for all outcasts, was brilliantly channelled into this mainstream dance hit. In a rebuke to religious inspired homophobia, she delivered the poignant lyric: \u201cI\u2019m beautiful in my way, cos God makes no mistakes.\u201d 18/25 8. Caitlyn Jenner on Vanity Fair & Laverne Cox on Time (2014, 2015) Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox was the first transgender woman on the cover of Time magazine, while Caitlyn Jenner presented herself for the first time on the cover of Vanity Fair the following year.

George Michael - Outside (1998) Six months after being spectacularly outed after an incident in a Los Angeles public toilet, George Michael decided to own it, with this number one single, complete with an outrageously tongue-in-cheek video about cruising. Jaw-dropping to this day. Youtube 20/25 6. Glee (2009) Glee presented high-camp musical numbers and wacky plot lines alongside some of the first openly gay and transgender characters seen within a high school setting. Its impact on a post-millennial generation of kids forging their own queer identities was enormous. Fox 21/25 5. Brokeback Mountain (2005) Perhaps the most famous LGBT film of all time, Brokeback Mountain was the first to put a gay relationship front and centre in a mainstream Hollywood plot. Focus/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 22/25 4. Queen at Live Aid (1985) Freddie Mercury wasn\u2019t open about his sexuality when he stole the show at Live Aid, but he was unmistakably one of our own. His 20-minute tour de force in front of two billion TV viewers goes down in history as the greatest rock performance of all time. Alamy Stock Photo 23/25 3. Philadelphia (1993) The first mainstream film to portray the HIV/Aids crisis was built on a haunting performance from Tom Hanks and brought an understanding of the issue to millions of cinemagoers. Rex Features 24/25 2. RuPaul's Drag Race (2009) The show that launched a thousand memes. RuPaul\u2019s incredible popularity is a testament to how widely the show reached out beyond the LGBT community and into the wider public, who have been duly educated about drag culture and the courage of those who take part. Getty Images 25/25 1. Will and Grace (1998) Will and Grace was the first time a sitcom put gay characters front and centre, and delighted audiences with its razor-sharp wit. Joe Biden once said the show \u201cprobably did more to educate the American public\u201d on gay issues than anything else. Powerful stuff. Rex Features 1/25 25.

Joe Biden once said the show \u201cprobably did more to educate the American public\u201d on gay issues than anything else. Powerful stuff. Rex Features\n\nLet\u2019s remember, in 1993 the age of consent for men who slept with men was 21 (for opposite-sex sexual activity it was 16). It was illegal for a 20-year-old man to have sex with his 20-year-old boyfriend. These types of laws legitimised homophobia and discrimination by othering LGBT+ people and implying our relationships were different. In 1994, it was lowered to 18, but it took another six years until it became equal at 16.\n\nSection 28 was also on the statute book (and stayed there until 2003) \u2013 stopping teachers from discussing same-sex relationships with their students. It was illegal for gay men to serve openly in the army until 2000. Civil partnerships didn\u2019t arrive until 2005 and same-sex marriage until 2014.\n\nThings have moved on significantly since the \u201cgay gene\u201d article was published. However, I think we need to be careful not to paint an overly rosy picture of society\u2019s attitude towards LGBT+ people. Even more worryingly, there are clear signs of the equality we\u2019ve spent so long fighting for being undermined.\n\nJust this summer, Home Office data showed the reports of anti-LGBT+ hate crimes have more than doubled in five years. In July, the British Social Attitudes survey showed that acceptance of same-sex relations fell for the first time in 30 years.\n\nIt is still unusual to see same-sex couples holding hands or showing affection to each other in public \u2013 especially outside of big cities. We\u2019ve seen violent homophobic attacks on our streets and protests against LGBT+ equality lessons outside a school in Birmingham. And outside of our borders, it is still illegal to be gay in 70 countries and punishable by death in eight.\n\nThe large majority of us aren\u2019t homophobic. But let\u2019s not whitewash LGBT+ history. Awful things were happening not that long ago and forgetting it was in recent times could stop us from regressing, and that matters much more than what scientists think of our genes.", "description": "On Friday morning\u00a0I posted a tweet which included a picture of a faded yellow cutting I took from a national newspaper in 1993.", "authors": ["Antony Tiernan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/12/16/lgbtheaderpicture-0.jpg"}
