You can only think about shows as representing the time that they are being made,\u201d he said. \u201cTV has evolved in being much more inclusive.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s easy to point to \u201cSex and the City\u201d for its lack of diversity, it\u2019s certainly not the only show from that time period to have a predominantly white cast, despite being set in New York City.\n\nNBC via Getty Images The cast of \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nThe beloved \u2014 and still insanely popular \u2014 NBC sitcom \u201cFriends\u201d has also been criticized for not reflecting New York as the melting pot that it is.\n\nAnd though Star \u2014 who also created hits like \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210\u201d and \u201cMelrose Place\u201d \u2014 now expresses regret for the lack of diversity on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d the cast of his newer show \u201cYounger,\u201d which premiered in 2015 and is also set in New York City, is predominately white.", "description": "Darren Star said the show was \u201ca product of its time.\u201d", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8c2a5210000751134a47e.jpeg?cache=5hhmmjqlsa&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
