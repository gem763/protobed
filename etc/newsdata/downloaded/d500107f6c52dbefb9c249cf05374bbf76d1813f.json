But the videos, shot at around 11pm, showed a man in a hat and a scarf inside the station. In one video, the man pointed a finger at people outside the station shooting videos and told them to leave. When asked why he was inside and why he hid his identity, the officer took out a flashlight and aimed it at the person shooting the video. \u201cWhy does it look like a flashlight that police use? I am just here to have late night food. I am just passing by,\u201d the person who shot the video said. In a second video, the officer took out what appeared to be pepper spray and pointed it at those outside the station.\n\nHong Kong police officials confirmed the presence of plainclothes officers in the Sheung Shui station on Tuesday night, purportedly to \u201ccarry out an investigation.\u201d The MTR railroad corporation said it also had security guards posted in the station.\n\n\u201cAll police officers certainly will not break the law. The police will continue to make use of different methods to combat crimes according to operational needs,\u201d the police department insisted.\n\nThese statements were challenged by citizens posting on the department\u2019s Facebook page who asked how the officer could justify covering his face and threatening bystanders with pepper spray, especially since Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam invoked emergency powers to make masks illegal last week.\n\n\u201cWere they conducting a mission to damage the station?\u201d one commenter wondered.\n\nEver since the first known deployment of undercover officers, there have been questions about whether they were acting as agitators in order to discredit the movement and goad real demonstrators into taking actions they could be arrested for.\n\nThe conduct of undercover police officers has frequently been criticized by protesters, including incidents where undercover officers suddenly revealed themselves and used unjustified levels of force against demonstrators. Arrests made by undercover police have been exceptionally brutal, in part because protesters thought the officers suddenly appearing in their midst and manhandling them might have been thugs or gangsters and responded fearfully.", "description": "An undercover Hong Kong police officer disguised as a protester was caught on video behaving in a highly belligerent manner toward bystanders.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1171989037-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
