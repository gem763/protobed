The England manager said that 'poor individual mistakes, a poor start to the game' after Kosovo took the lead in under a minute. However, it was a good night for England's attacking trio. Southgate singled out Raheem Sterling in particular, saying, 'He's been almost unstoppable, his awareness of where defenders were, his ability to ride challenges, his vision and desire to get in on goal, and unselfish play as well, so I couldn't speak highly enough of the way he played'", "description": "It was a good night for Sterling, Kane and Sancho, less so for England's defenders", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/591792ff5e3912d71df83088e914e86ddfb498de/0_0_3356_2013/master/3356.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13d2066c1b2bb9771bb3d44fd7136c83", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
