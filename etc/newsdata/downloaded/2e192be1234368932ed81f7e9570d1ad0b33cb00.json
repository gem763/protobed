A video on its website, entitled \u201cWe Stand for Equality with Our Words and Actions,\u201d includes footage of people wearing \u201cRefugees Welcome\u201d T-shirts and features congresswoman Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)\u2014who has introduced legislation to abolish ICE\u2014speaking about gender equality.\n\n\u201cInclusivity, diversity, equality,\u201d a narrator says at the beginning of the video. \u201cLet\u2019s go make that world.\u201d\n\nBut quietly, AT&T, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications company, is making millions off of its work with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\u2014at least $14.3 million so far this year to be exact, according to the government spending tracker USAspending.gov.\n\nAT&T has been in business with ICE since at least 2008. But the amount of money it has received from the agency has grown substantially in recent years. In 2014, by comparison, the company only took in $590,000 from ICE.\n\nThe ICE contracts represent only a small fraction of AT&T\u2019s bottom line. In July, the company reported its second quarter profits, bringing their total profit for the first half of 2019 to $7.8 billion.\n\nICE has mostly funneled money to AT&T in exchange for cellular data service, though some has also been allocated to \u201cpurchasing telematic devices for ICE vehicles.\u201d AT&T did not respond to VICE when it asked how its telematic devices serve ICE, nor did it respond to multiple requests for comment. However, the company advertises telematic devices that record and report car data that includes vehicle performance, location tracking, and driver behaviors.\n\nProtests and boycotts against companies working with ICE escalated this summer as increasingly harrowing reports continued to emerge about the agency\u2019s family separation policy, faulty and insufficient family reunification plans, and inhumane conditions inside detention facilities, including denying beds, soap, adequate food, and medical care to detained immigrants. Campaigns against GitHub, Amazon, Wayfair, and Palantir\u2014all companies that have worked with ICE in one way or another\u2014have garnered attention online and offline. But while those and a small handful of other ICE-associated companies have faced pressure to cut business ties with the agency, AT&T has not been subjected to the same level of scrutiny.\n\nThey\u2019re not alone either. For now, hundreds of other businesses that profit from ICE\u2019s $6 billion tax-funded budget are flying under the radar.\n\nDo you work at ICE or one of the companies that works with them?
