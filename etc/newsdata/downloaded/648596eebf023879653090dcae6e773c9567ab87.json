(AP) - Ben Bredeson had a chance to cash in on his potential this year in the NFL.\n\nThe All America offensive guard, though, chose to stay at Michigan for his senior season and to take out an insurance policy, providing some financial protection if an injury hurts his stock in the draft.\n\nBredeson acknowledged he has \u201cnot much\u201d money in the bank right now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a college kid,\u201d he said, shrugging his broad shoulders.\n\nAnd, Bredeson does not regret the college-over-money choice he made.\n\n\u201cI absolutely feel good about my decision every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time I\u2019m done here in December, I will have graduated and played four years with the best friends I could\u2019ve at Michigan. I was able to take three trips overseas to see two different continents all over the world.\n\n\u201cThe things I\u2019ve been able to do here have just been unimaginable when I was 17 making this decision.\u201d\n\nWhen the 11th-ranked Wolverines (2-0) play the 13th-ranked Badgers (2-0) Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium, he will get another chance to let the home team it let one of the state\u2019s top recruits get away.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really good player and it looks to me like he loves playing the game,\u201d Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst said. \u201cHe\u2019s a leader on their team and that says a lot. I have a ton of respect for him.\u201d\n\nBredeson was a highly touted recruit in Hartland, Wisconsin, at Arrowhead High School about 50 miles east of the Badgers\u2019 campus. Bredeson estimated about one-third of his graduating class attends Wisconsin.\n\nLike everyone around him, he grew up rooting for the Badgers on Saturday and Green Bay on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other football school there and you grow loving the Badgers and the Packers. You don\u2019t have much of an option,\u201d Bredeson said. \u201cThroughout the recruiting process, they were there from the beginning and all the way to the end.\u201d\n\nJim Harbaugh was in his first full recruiting year at Michigan when he signed Bredeson, a key player he needed to improve one of the weak links of the program inherited from fired coach Brady Hoke.\n\n\u201cSomebody that was older than his years when we were recruiting him, a mature guy physically,\u201d Harbaugh recalled.\n\nBredeson has lived up to the billing, starting a team-high 35 games during his three-plus year career. The 6-foot-5, 320-pound Bredeson was a second team All-America player last year.\n\n\u201cTakes it real seriously,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cHe\u2019s very dedicated. He\u2019s been plus, plus, plus at everything.\u201d\n\nBredeson is big, talented and experienced enough to coast in college and do well on the field. Instead, he has pushed himself to constantly improve his fundamentals and techniques to be one of the best linemen not in the NFL. He regularly leans on offensive line coach Ed Warninner for advice and also asks former Michigan and NFL offensive lineman Jon Jansen for tips.\n\n\u201cHe has really developed over the last couple of years by concentrating on the little things like the way he takes his first step and where his puts his hands,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cWhen NFL coaches and scouts are looking at him, they\u2019ll see a player who got better at something during each of his four years and that\u2019s what they want to see.\u201d\n\nLong before he plays with pros, Bredeson wants to see the new-look offense he is a part of to perform closer to its potential.\n\nThe Wolverines opened with a lackluster win over Middle Tennessee and barely beat Army in double overtime in large part because they have lost five fumbles, dropped a lot of passes and have been called for many penalties during plays and before the ball has been snapped.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different running this offense in practice when you can script looks and react to things and learned a lot in that Army game,\u201d Bredeson said. \u201cHaving the bye week and addressing the issues right away was huge.\u201d\n\nMichigan does not have much more time to get its offense in rhythm because it will likely be tested by the Badgers.\n\n\u201cThis offense is complicated and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts to it,\u201d Bredeson said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it both sides when we\u2019re struggling in practice and nothing is right and I\u2019ve seen it when it\u2019s clicking and there\u2019s no way to stop it. We just need to get that full stride in a game still.\n\n\u201cGoing against the No. 1 defense so far in the country, I\u2019m looking forward to running this against them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ben Bredeson had a chance to cash in on his potential this year in the NFL.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/army_michigan_football_09400_c0-172-4118-2573_s1770x1032.jpg?906fd1085da8833e8b7cf5256bb6e0b52464df3d", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
