It's Energy Efficiency Day , which is an opportunity to cast a bright (albeit energy efficient) light on one of the easiest ways to contribute to fighting climate change.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmerica can reduce our overall energy use 40 to 60 percent below current levels by midcentury by using better technologies and eliminating waste. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising when you consider that, in 2018, more than two-thirds of the energy we produced went to waste.\n\nEven if we used polluting and dangerous fuels more efficiently, damage from activities such as drilling, mining, pipeline construction, coal trains and the discharge of radioactive waste still do tremendous harm to our world. But when you consider the tremendous amount that is wasted in the production and use of energy, it only makes matters worse.\n\nHere are some actions you can take at home this Energy Efficiency Day to make a difference.\n\nFor instance, you should avoid screensavers on your home computers or televisions and opt for low power or sleep modes instead. Or, try changing out your light bulbs for LEDs. (Fun fact: LEDs are the world\u2019s most energy-efficient lighting, using up to 15 percent less energy than compact fluorescent bulbs.)\n\nCaulking and weatherstripping windows is another simple and effective way to avoid requiring more energy to keep your home at a comfortable temperature. You can opt for energy efficiency-certified products in the kitchen, including refrigerators, microwaves and dishwashers, which have come a long way in becoming more efficient. (Additional fun fact: the average microwave uses more power displaying the time in one year than it does heating your food.)\n\nFor those ready to make a bigger commitment, you can buy an electric car Plug-in hybrids or electric cars can reduce smog-forming emissions by 93 percent and are much more energy efficient in general compared to gasoline-fueled vehicles.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOnce you\u2019ve embraced these changes, encourage your neighbors, family and friends to do so as well. Join together with your community to demand better programs to help us all save energy. What is your state doing to address energy waste? Your city or town? Urge our local, state and national officials to do more.\n\nOver the last decade, we\u2019ve made some progress in this area, with energy consumption per capita in the U.S. falling by almost 8 percent from 2007 to 2018. But even as we celebrate, we know that more must be done to reduce energy waste.\n\nEnergy savings and efficiency is our cheapest and easiest climate solution. We have the resources. We have the technology. We have the power to protect our planet, our climate and our health.\n\nThere is a better way. It\u2019s time to get more efficient.\n\nRob Sargent is senior director of Environment America's Energy Program.", "description": "Tomorrow is Energy Efficiency Day, which is an opportunity to cast a bright (albeit energy efficient) light on fighting climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/us_power_grid_10152018_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
