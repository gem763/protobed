Now, the NLDS is on to Game 5.", "language": "en", "text": "The Atlanta Braves on Monday were four outs away from clinching their National League Division Series in four games, a victory that would have done wonders for them \u2014 allowing them to reset their rotation to an optimum order for the next series and given achy hitters such as Freddie Freeman a few days to get well.\n\nInstead, the Braves found themselves flying back to Atlanta on Monday night to prepare for Wednesday\u2019s Game 5 against the St. Louis Cardinals. For that, they can blame their own failures, some exceptional relief work from the Cardinals\u2019 bullpen and the cursed baseball fates \u2014 all of which ganged up on the Braves in a 5-4, 10-inning loss.\n\nWhen it comes to the adage \u201cBaseball is a funny game,\u201d we can now quantify that, thanks to the wonders of Statcast and its exit-velocity readings.\n\nIn the ninth and 10th innings alone, the Braves made four outs on balls that left the bat at 100 mph or greater; this season, major league hitters batted .636 on balls with such an exit velocity. But the eighth-inning base hit that sent the game to extra innings, the single by Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina off the tip of Freeman\u2019s glove at first base, clocked in at 63.4 mph \u2014 the third-lowest of the 49 batted balls Monday.\n\nTwo innings later, Molina drove in the winning run with a deep sacrifice fly to left (with an exit velo of 102.1 mph, for all of you Statcast nerds) off Braves right-hander Julio Teheran. Teheran, who had been added to the Braves\u2019 roster in the aftermath of Chris Martin\u2019s oblique injury in Game 1, wasn\u2019t expected to see high-leverage innings \u2014 but bullpen ace Max Fried was unavailable after pitching in each of the first three games of the series, and Braves Manager Brian Snitker held back closer Mark Melancon for a potential save situation.\n\n[MLB playoff bracket and schedule]\n\nOne batter before Molina walked it off for the Cardinals \u2014 punctuating the winning swing with a boomerang-style bat flip for the ages \u2014 the Braves, with runners on first and second base, nearly converted a 1-4-3 double play on Marcell Ozuna\u2019s slow tapper to the left of the mound, but Ozuna beat the throw at first by less than half a step. There was no play at third because third baseman Josh Donaldson was charging the grounder. That\u2019s how narrow the margin between winning and losing was in this one.\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 win, which required 5\u2153 scoreless innings from their bullpen, sent the series back to Atlanta \u2014 with a pitching matchup that now favors the Cardinals. They will send ace Jack Flaherty, who posted a 0.93 ERA across his final 16 starts of the regular season, to the mound against Braves right-hander Mike Foltynewicz. Yes, the Braves won that same matchup in Game 2, with Foltynewicz outpitching Flaherty, but you can be sure the Braves wanted no part of a rematch.\n\nThe Braves will lament any number of missed opportunities and ill-fated decisions in Monday\u2019s loss \u2014 beginning with the decision to double-switch right fielder Matt Joyce out of the game in the fourth inning when they pulled starter Dallas Keuchel, who was in the process of putting the Braves in a 3-1 hole.\n\nOf course Joyce\u2019s spot in the order would come up in one of the biggest spots in the game \u2014 with the bases loaded and two outs in the seventh, with the Braves holding a one-run lead. And of course pinch hitter Adeiny Hechavarr\u00eda would fly out to end the inning \u2014 symbolic of a day when the Braves went 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position, stranding the bases loaded in both the sixth and seventh. The Braves also managed the rare feat of wasting a leadoff triple in the seventh and a leadoff double in the ninth, both off the bat of Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr.\n\nKeuchel\u2019s struggles, meanwhile, underscored the Braves\u2019 choice to start him in Game 1 in Atlanta, instead of \u00ad22-year-old ace Mike Soroka \u2014 a choice ostensibly made because Soroka had far better results on the road \u2014 and again Monday on three days\u2019 rest. But given the choice of two starts from Soroka (who overpowered the Cardinals for seven innings in Game 3) or two from Keuchel, they probably would have been better off with the former.\n\n[These Braves are unrecognizable from last year\u2019s team, and more dangerous than ever]\n\nAnd then there is the heart of the Braves\u2019 order \u2014 Freeman, Donaldson and Nick Markakis \u2014 which went a combined 1 for 12 with four strikeouts and six runners left on base. Freeman contributed three of those strikeouts and hit into a double play, leaving him 2 for 16 with five strikeouts in the series. Despite an elbow injury that has nagged him all season and forced him out of the lineup for four games during the final week of the regular season, he insisted he is not hurt.\n\nIt would have been a victory that resonated beyond one simple outcome for the Braves, who haven\u2019t captured a postseason series since 2001, losing seven times in the division series in the interim, as well as the 2012 wild-card game. Monday\u2019s loss was the sixth straight for the franchise in games where it had the chance to advance.\n\nInstead, it was a loss that resonated beyond Monday\u2019s outcome. The Braves still need that one more win to advance, but now, with Flaherty awaiting in Game 5, the series has tilted ever so slightly against them.", "description": "Atlanta missed an opportunity to close out St. Louis in Game 4 and faces a difficult matchup Wednesday.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer", "October At Pm", "Dave Sheinin Has Been A Washington Post Sports Writer Since Before Working At The Post", "He Covered Golf", "Florida Gators Football", "Major League Baseball For The Miami Herald."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QdwuNDB-JTsShE_mz-rbNGl7dPM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VA4D7DHJNII6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
