And the number of clubs in the US is diminishing. In the mid- to late 1990s, there were more than 5,000 member-owned, full-service golf and country clubs in the US, Frank Vain, president of St. Louis-based consulting firm McMahon Group, told The Roanoak Times. By 2017, that number had fallen to about 3,900, he said.\n\nAs Kelsey Lawrence reported last year for CityLab, country clubs have had trouble attracting millennials for several reasons: The \"brokest\" and \"most indebted\" generation can't afford the thousands-of-dollars-per-year membership dues and they don't love playing golf. Another problem is country clubs' reputation for being stuffy and not particularly diverse, according to Lawrence.\n\nTo appeal to a younger generation, country clubs are moving away from their traditional mainstays \u2014 including golf\n\nHenry Wallmeyer, the president and CEO of the National Club Association, says country clubs are evolving to appeal to a younger and more diverse clientele.\n\n\"Clubs have transformed dramatically over the last 10 years \u2014 especially coming out of the recession in 2008 and 2009 \u2014 because their members have changed, and the old model of the club just does not work anymore,\" Wallmeyer said.\n\nThe National Club Association, a trade association and advocacy group for private clubs, represents about 700 private clubs across the US. The majority \u2014 about 80% \u2014 of its member clubs are golf country clubs, while the rest include city clubs, athletic clubs, yacht clubs, and military clubs.\n\nDiners at a country club in Pennsylvania.

Today, that's down to 6.1 million.\n\n\"We're now seeing that golf is probably maybe the fourth most important thing at a club,\" Wallmeyer said.\n\nFamily-friendly activities, casual dining options, and health and wellness amenities are becoming the new focus of country clubs\n\nCountry clubs today are becoming more family-centric and offering a wider range of activities and amenities, according to Wallmeyer.\n\nWhereas traditionally the father in the family was the primary clubgoer, only occasionally joined at the club by his family for a meal, clubs today are trying to be more inclusive of families.\n\nTennis, for example, is becoming more popular because it's not as time-consuming as golf and a family of four can play together, Wallmeyer says.\n\nCountry clubs are pushing activities other than golf.

While jeans used to be forbidden in most country clubs, about 87% of clubs now allow denim in some part of the clubhouse, according to Wallmeyer.\n\nThe move toward more casual clothing means more casual dining, as well, Wallmeyer says. Many clubs are offering sports-bar type eateries, as well as grab-and-go food options.\n\n\"They're just trying to mimic what is out there in society that people are using, like Panera type of offerings or Starbucks, those type of things,\" Wallmeyer said.\n\nCountry clubs are all about community \u2014 but what community is that exactly?\n\nPeople belong to private clubs first and foremost for a sense of community, Wallmeyer says.\n\n\"They want to be with their friends, be with people who are of a like mind,\" he said.\n\nBut while private clubs that have most successfully appealed to millennials such as Soho House and The Wing have distinct target communities \u2014 young urban creatives and urban professional women, respectively \u2014 what makes up a country club community today is less clear.\n\nCountry clubs have traditionally been geared toward affluent white men.\n\nTraditionally, country clubs have been meant for white men. Getty Images\n\n\"Really, that golf problem is a big one, but also clubs' history of not being open to certain groups,\" MaryLeigh Bliss of Ypulse, a millennial-focused research firm, told Lawrence at CityLab. \"Country clubs have that long-term history of being only for high-income white families, and that's not something millennials are really looking for.\"\n\nAccording to Wallmeyer, \"it's good when clubs have a varied membership base,\" but what sets them apart is essentially the multiple amenities that can be found all in one place.\n\n\"I think the thing that country clubs have, in terms of their niche \u2014 it's that facility, whether it's a top 100 golf course or outstanding fitness facilities or tennis or the food and beverage or whatever that might be,\" Wallmeyer said. \"... I think clubs have great opportunities because they have so many different things that they can offer.\"\n\nBut for a generation that's stuck paying off mountains of student debt and has to go into debt just to attend a music festival, paying thousands of dollars a year for what is essentially access to a restaurant and a golf course may not be enough of a draw.", "description": "Millennials, the \"brokest generation,\" can't afford the membership dues for country clubs, and they don't particularly enjoy playing golf.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f47a3122bd524ed092993?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
