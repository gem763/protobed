Political turmoil surrounding the U.K.'s exit from the European Union is adding to the uncertainty, particularly for lenders like Santander with large U.K. operations. Santander reported a 18% drop in second-quarter net profit over restructuring costs at home and a squeeze on U.K. mortgage margins.\n\nThe lender said the charge was mostly due to a challenging regulatory environment, mentioning the negative impact of \"ringfencing\" rules, under which U.K. lenders must separate retail banking from riskier investment-banking operations. By separating the businesses, many costs have been duplicated.\n\nThe rules, which were imposed on banks following the financial crisis, have also increased competition on mortgage lending in the U.K. because banks with both retail and investment banking operations had to stop using retail deposits to spur their business for corporate clients. As a result, several banks have diverted the liquidity into mortgage lending. Santander, which also has big operations in Brazil, is focused on retail banking.\n\n\"While ringfencing reforms and Brexit have impacted profitability in the U.K., it remains a critically important market, in which the group is investing significantly to service our customers and to continue to compete,\" the bank's executive chairman, Ana Bot\u00edn, said.\n\nThe British economy contracted in the second quarter as uncertainty over the country's planned departure from the European Union on Oct. 31 hurt business confidence. Since then, uncertainty over the U.K.'s relationship with the EU has deepened further.\n\nSantander said the impairment charge will be reported in its third-quarter results. The bank said its core capital ratio won't be affected.\n\nShares of Santander followed the broader banking sector and were down 2.4% at about noon Wednesday. The impairment charge was announced after the market closed Tuesday.\n\nThe lender will pay the first of two annual dividend payments starting in November. Shareholders will get EUR0.10 a share in cash.\n\nWrite to Pietro Lombardi at Pietro.Lombardi@dowjones.com and Patricia Kowsmann at patricia.kowsmann@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
