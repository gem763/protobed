Got a question you'd like to ask Hilary? Email it to editorial@gplusmedia.com with the subject \"Ask Hilary.\"\n\nDear Hilary,\n\nI\u2019m an American woman. I\u2019ve lived in Japan for seven years and have been dating the same Japanese man for four years\u2014living together for two. We have a great relationship. We go out to events regularly, see movies together, we\u2019re like any other couple.\n\nDuring the last year, our sex life has gotten out of control. We go through these roller coasters of either having sex all the time or having none at all. Right now we\u2019re in the middle of a month-long dry spell. Neither of us has any physical issues (perfect health checks this year!) we both work long hours like everybody else, but otherwise, we are fine.\n\nWhen things are good, we both initiate and have no trouble functioning, but then it\u2019s like we get tired of sex. For me, I start feeling like sex gets boring and I don\u2019t want to be the one to initiate. Then I guess my boyfriend gets tired of initiating, and we just stop having sex. When we aren\u2019t having sex we\u2019re still close but then we get frustrated, have these huge fights, and then have make up sex, and start a new cycle all over again.\n\nI\u2019m tired of dealing with this. I know it\u2019s not healthy, but when I talk to my married friends they say that it\u2019s just normal for sex to drop off, or they tell me that in Japan sexless marriages are normal. I don\u2019t want that, and I don\u2019t think my boyfriend does either. How do I break this cycle? Is there something either of us can do to even things out again? \u2013 Sorta Sexless In Tokyo\n\nDear Sexless In Tokyo,\n\nJudging from your email alone, it sounds like you both are attracted to each other and are capable of initiating and enjoying sex. But, you said that eventually \u201csex gets boring\u201d and you don\u2019t want to initiate, which means if your boyfriend doesn\u2019t initiate it, it doesn\u2019t happen. It sounds like you\u2019re both getting stuck in the same old routine of sex\u2014in other words, you have established a certain rhythm that is easy and satisfying in the moment, but gets boring quickly.\n\nWe go through these roller coasters of either having sex all the time or having none at all.\n\nOne way to resolve this requires two discussions: one with yourself and one with your partner. You\u2019re the one that says sex gets boring\u2014why or how is it boring? Is it not satisfying your physical needs, emotional needs, both, neither? What would make it more satisfying in whichever area is lacking? Do you have something you want to bring into the bedroom in terms of fantasy, toys, or positions that would fix the issue in the long term for you?\n\nWhen you have figured that out for yourself, then it\u2019s time to sit down with your partner and have a serious conversation about sex. I don\u2019t know his side of the story, but it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s getting bored, just as you are. If so, then ask him the same questions that you asked yourself. Give him time to think about these things, too\u2014this isn\u2019t meant to be some quick interview. There might be something that he\u2019s been looking to change up about your love lives too and deserves the same opportunity to sort out how he feels.\n\nWhen you both have figured out what your sex life is missing, your next step is to work on bringing that missing element back into the bedroom.\n\nThis might take a while to figure out, and the discussion could even last over several days. That\u2019s completely normal. It may also feel awkward because sex is a highly personal topic. Expectations and cultural beliefs about sex also differ widely between Japan and the US, so there are also some culture shock\u2014so to speak\u2014issues that might come up. You might want to read more about talking about sex in Japanese first too.\n\nWhen you both have figured out what your sex life is missing, your next step is to work on bringing that missing element back into the bedroom. If it\u2019s related to the physical act itself, why not try watching some adult videos together? There are literally thousands of free resources online that could help. If you both want to introduce toys into the bedroom, then why not visit one of Tokyo\u2019s many sex toy shops together? Love Merci in Akihabara is a popular option, but there are also plenty of smaller shops near the love hotels in Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Ikebukuro as well.\n\nIf you and your partner figure out what\u2019s missing, you\u2019ll both be better equipped to fix the problem. That way, you can stop that unsatisfying roller coaster from starting up once more.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hilary Keyes"], "top_image": "https://savvytokyo.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/2019/10/Letters-from-Japan-\u201cSex-Isn\u2019t-Fun-Anymore\u201d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
