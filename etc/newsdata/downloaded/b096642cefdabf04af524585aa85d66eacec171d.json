Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), who stonewalled his questions and launched into a conspiracy-laden defense of the president in which he took aim at Brennan, who is a frequent critic of Trump.\n\nHis remarks strayed so far from the topic at hand that a visibly exasperated Todd slammed the senator for peddling Fox News \u201cpropaganda\u201d on air.\n\nBrennan, who subsequently hit back at Johnson\u2019s remarks, cautioned that he is part of the problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a democracy if an autocrat has it in his hands, and people like Johnson and others are putty in his hands, which means that the democratic principles on which this country [was] founded are eroding right now,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nAt the center of scandal swirling around Trump is a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he pressed Zelensky to assist both Attorney General William Barr and lawyer Rudy Giuliani with a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, based on unsubstantiated corruption accusations. At the time of the discussion, U.S. aid to Ukraine was being withheld.\n\nOn Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, described the situation to Johnson as a quid pro quo in which the aid was contingent on an agreement to investigate the Bidens. Johnson told the Journal that he then confronted Trump about the matter, and Trump denied that was the case.\n\nAppearing uncomfortable with any suggestion of a deal, Johnson told the Journal he \u201cwinced\u201d at the notion.\n\n\u201cMy reaction was: Oh, God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Johnson refused to further explain this concern, claiming Trump\u2019s administration has been \u201csabotaged from the day after election.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a democracy if an autocrat has it in his hands,\" the former CIA director warned.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9a636e200000f2004e31ba.jpeg?cache=jhxghjfjvf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
