Chelsea, who also lost on penalties to Liverpool in the Uefa Super Cup final, have made an inconsistent start under Lampard, who has won only two of his first seven matches in charge. But Klopp believes the new Chelsea manager is developing an exciting young side that reminds him of his early work with Dortmund.\n\nThe Liverpool manager said: \u201cThey had a couple of problems but they sorted them well. It\u2019s a really exciting team. It reminds me a little bit of my team at Dortmund years back. They were really young and people always spoke about that but they only played because they were that good.\n\n\u201cChelsea brought in Pulisic in the summer. I don\u2019t know about the money but it was \u00a350m-60m. All the players around him now have the same value. Tammy Abraham is a \u00a360m player, Mason Mount for sure is 60m, maybe more. Hudson-Odoi was already that. Jorginho is still young, Kante looks like he could play for the next 20 years, Kovacic, Barkley, then the experienced guys around them, Pedro, Willian, Giroud.\n\n\u201cIf there was one club in the world where a transfer ban didn\u2019t hit that bad it was probably Chelsea because of their transfer policy in the last few years with these high quality players out on loan. Abraham didn\u2019t learn where the goal is at Chelsea, he found it in different places. They are just a good team, they have all my respect. They are a proper contender for everything. Now we play there and we want to get something.\u201d", "description": "Friday football countdown: Get all the latest developments ahead of the weekend\u2019s fixtures with David Tindall", "authors": ["David Tindall", "Tom Davies", "Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ffe53c3ac511357a416aeb046904ba2ba333401/134_307_3833_2300/master/3833.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f8a1dfaf706789804cf1fbefec75732", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
