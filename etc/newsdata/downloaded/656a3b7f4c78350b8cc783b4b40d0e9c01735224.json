Dee Wright, the owner of The Hairforce, a chain of self-styled \u201clice assassins\u201d, says: \u201cIf you check your child\u2019s hair and find a bunch of nits [eggs], you should be combing immediately, rather than waiting to spot a live one. It\u2019s good to do a weekly check.\u201d\n\nChoose your weapon wisely\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018With thick or long hair, you need to spend 20 to 30 minutes per session.\u2019 Photograph: Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nMany of Britain\u2019s bestselling nit combs are ineffective, says Burgess: \u201cThey have gaps so wide that lice and nits can slip through.\u201d He recommends using a plastic detection comb. \u201cIt needs to be rigid, and the front needs to be squared, to catch the legs of the lice.\u201d The Bug Buster Kit sold by the charity Community Hygiene Concern contains these types of combs, with different sizes for lice and nits, and is available on the NHS (free for children diagnosed with lice). \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be done in five minutes,\u201d says Burgess. \u201cWith thick or long hair, you need to spend 20 to 30 minutes per session. If you\u2019ve found a dozen and think you\u2019ve done a good job, you probably haven\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019ll be at least another dozen hiding.\u201d\n\nComb with care\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Detangle the hair first and use conditioner.

Detangle the hair first and use conditioner. Metal combs, especially, can shred individual hairs, says Burgess. \u201cWe have even come across pseudo nits, where the comb has peeled back little knots that look and feel like nits,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to comb, you need to use a lubricant and do it carefully.\u201d\n\nForget chemical pesticides\n\nBurgess says that we have known about pesticide-resistant lice in the UK since 1995, yet chemical pesticide treatments are still sold \u2013 and frequently recommended by pharmacists and prescribed by doctors. \u201cGPs aren\u2019t listening,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly surprising there are a lot of lice.\u201d\n\nPlay the long game\n\nSilicone-based shampoo treatments, otherwise known as physical pesticides, may effectively smother the lice, but some of the dreaded nits can survive. \u201cWe looked at nearly 1,895 case records,\u201d says Burgess. \u201cMost of those who had baby lice appear after a treatment had them within the first week, but the longest case was 13 days.\u201d Either treat again a week or so later, or keep combing for a few weeks to catch any late hatchers.", "description": "Parents dread discovering an infestation of the itchy menaces, but with the right approach you can stop them in their tracks", "authors": ["Amy Fleming"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97c3f15c32357283157725a4c4629252779f0bf/213_0_5547_3328/master/5547.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30ce1bd69f4bcaa86673e5731d3b88c6", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
