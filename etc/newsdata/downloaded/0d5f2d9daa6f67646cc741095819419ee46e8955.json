This confirmation follows a reported security breach that compromised personal data of 21 million passengers including that of Malindo's sister company, Lion Air.\n\nForensic and data consultants also had been appointed to assess the overall data security infrastructure, focusing on passenger data protection across all platforms, said Malindo Air in a statement Thursday. In addition, it said remedial measures involving the notification of financial institutions, the police, and other relevant authorities had been established.\n\nKey takeaways from Singapore healthcare data breach No system is infallible and cybersecurity breaches are inevitable, but Singapore needs to do better in mitigating the risks and following through on its pledge to safeguard citizen data.

The cloud vendor, alongside Malindo Air's e-commerce vendor GoQuo, had begun investigating the breach.\n\nMalindo Air said it had put in place \"adequate measures\" that complied with Malaysia's Personal Data Protection Act to ensure its customer data were not compromised. The airline added that it did not store any payment details of on its servers and were compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS).\n\nMembers of Malindo Air's frequent flyer programme were further advised to change their passwords if they had used similar passwords on other online services.\n\nThe security breach came to light when Kaspersky Lab last week pushed a tip to its cloud users in Thailand, alerting them to exercise caution when managing incoming email and text messages and calls. The Russian cybersecurity vendor said personal details belonging to passengers of Lion Group's Malindo Air and Lion Air had been posted in online forums and put on sale on the dark web.\n\nThe breach reportedly was due to an unsecured AWS data bucket.\n\nCheck Point Software Technologies's Asia-Pacific head of cloud security, Michael Petit, said in a note: \"Data stored in cloud services like AWS S3 buckets are only as secure as their security configuration settings. Cloud services are convenient, but require proper configuration for the best security possible within the confines of such technologies.\n\n\"Companies may have hundreds, thousands or even millions of S3 buckets or similar cloud data storage on other competing platforms. With such complexity of data storage in the cloud, it is imperative for companies to persistently audit and correct misconfigurations, as cloud services may also change their settings occasionally,\" Petit noted. \"This is a necessarily laborious and time-consuming process for companies.\"\n\nAccording to Check Point, personal data compromised in the breach included the passenger's date of birth, passport number, and mobile number.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nLack of collaboration, disclosure affecting APAC security posture\n\nThreat actors are collaborating more effectively than legit businesses in the region, which aren't sharing enough intelligence with others in the industry, says Microsoft Asia CSO.\n\nCyberattacks can cost APAC healthcare firms $23.3M\n\nHealthcare organisations in Asia-Pacific can incur economic losses of up to US$23.3 million from cybersecurity incidents, though, 45% have either experienced or are not even sure if they have experienced a cyber attack.\n\nAPAC consumers have little trust in digital services\n\nJust 31% of Asian consumers believe their personal data will be managed in a trustworthy way by businesses offering digital services, with 40% revealing their trust has been compromised whilst using such services.\n\nOne in four APAC firms not sure if they suffered security breach\n\nA quarter of Asia-Pacific companies have experienced a security incident, while 27 percent aren't even sure because they haven't conducted any data breach assessment--even as the region is estimated to have lost US$1.75 trillion last year due to cyberattacks.\n\nAPAC firms look to edge for faster response but worry over data security\n\nEdge computing is being sought out for faster response and cost savings, but there are concerns about security and latency when large volumes of data are processed on such platforms.", "description": "Amazon Web Services says servers containing customer information belonging to the Malaysian airline are secured, following a breach that compromised personal data of 21 million passengers, including that of Malindo's parent company, Lion Air.", "authors": ["Eileen Yu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/18/5c0bc47e-26c0-11e4-8c7f-00505685119a/thumbnail/770x578/2fb9aee53b2ad725e6d5b0df89a32533/concerned-about-security-in-the-cloud-this-is-what-you-should-ask-your-cloud-service-provider.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
