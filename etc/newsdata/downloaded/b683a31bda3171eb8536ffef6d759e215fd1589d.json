Elijah E. Cummings, who passed away last week at the age of 68: \" \u2026 a leader who \u2014 like the prophet whose name he shared \u2014 'saw wrongdoing and spent his life working to banish it from our land,'\" our colleagues Jenna Portnoy and Ovetta Wiggins write.\n\nThe escalating partisan drama of an impeachment inquiry that has divided Congress more than ever was put aside for a day to remember the person who, as chair of the House Oversight Committee, had taken a prominent role in investigating President Trump.\n\nThe Maryland lawmaker was described by colleaguesas a moral force, loyal to the city of Baltimore and devoted to civil rights and his constituents \u2014 \u201cour North Star\u201d and \u201ca mentor of the House,\u201d according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cHe was strong, very strong when necessary, but also kind and caring and honorable,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), adding that Cummings was \u201cuniversally respected and admired in a divided time\" for standing by his principles.\n\nsaid Sen.

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) delivered a eulogy for the lawmaker he called his \u201cdear friend,\u201d who was lying in state in the Statuary Hall:\n\n\u201cSome have classified it as an unexpected friendship but for those of us that know Elijah \u2026 it's not unexpected or surprising,\u201d Meadows said, per NPR's Amita Kelly.\n\n\u201cSo Elijah has left his tent to go to a mansion, a better place. Perhaps this place and this country would be better served with a few more unexpected friendships,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I've been blessed by one.\u201d\n\nMorgan State University choir gives performance during ceremony for the late Rep.

Chestnut Jr., who was killed in 1998 by a gunman who had burst into the Capitol.\u201d\n\nHumble beginnings: The civil rights advocate was \u201ca sharecroppers\u2019 son who said he was shaped by his humble roots,\" per The Sun's Jeff Baker. \u201c Cummings, in an interview several months ago with The Baltimore Sun, said he never took for granted his rise to the halls of power and still sometimes still thought of himself as a young boy in special education class in Baltimore . In the summer of 1962, he said, white mobs taunted and threw rocks and bottles at Cummings and other African American kids seeking to integrate the Riverside Park pool in South Baltimore.\"\n\nThe civil rights advocate was \u201ca sharecroppers\u2019 son who said he was shaped by his humble roots,\" per The Sun's Jeff Baker. \u201c .

(Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times/Bloomberg)\n\nThe Investigations\n\n\ud83d\udea8: An administrative review of the Russia investigation that began this past May, overseen by Attorney General William Barr, has turned into a criminal inquiry, the New York Times's Katie Benner and Adam Goldman scooped last night.\n\n\u201cFor more than two years, President Trump has repeatedly attacked the Russia investigation, portraying it as a hoax and illegal even months after the special counsel closed it. Now, Mr. Trump\u2019s own Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into how it all began....The move gives the prosecutor running it, John H. Durham, the power to subpoena for witness testimony and documents, to convene a grand jury and to file criminal charges.\"\n\nKey: \u201cThe opening of a criminal investigation is likely to raise alarms that Mr. Trump is using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies. Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director under whose watch agents opened the Russia inquiry, and has long assailed other top former law enforcement and intelligence officials as partisans who sought to block his election,\" per Benner and Goldman.\n\n\u201cThe opening of a criminal investigation is likely to raise alarms that Mr. Trump is using the Justice Department to go after his perceived enemies.

It's unclear what potential crime is being investigated or what prompted the shift to a criminal inquiry but, \u201cin interviewing more than two dozen former and current F.B.I. and intelligence officials, Mr. Durham\u2019s investigators have asked about any anti-Trump bias among officials who worked on the Russia investigation and about one aspect of the investigation that was at the heart of highly contentious allegations that they abused their powers: the secret application seeking a court order for a wiretap on [Trump campaign adviser Carter] Page.\u201d\n\nSome context from my colleague Matt Zapotosky: \"The significance of officials deeming Durham\u2019s probe 'criminal is difficult to determine by itself. Durham\u2019s appointment was noteworthy because he, unlike the inspector general, is a federal prosecutor with the ability to convene a grand jury that could compel witnesses to testify or charge people with crimes if Durham felt that was necessary.\"\n\nrealDonaldTrump liked this tweet: https://t.co/etjMYuT6l5 \u2014 Trump Alert (@TrumpsAlert) October 25, 2019\n\nOn The Hill\n\nIMPEACHMENT INQUIRY UPDATE: The White House delayed a trade deal with Ukraine this past August, our colleagues David J.

But over the past month, they have grown cold to the idea of exposing him to additional scrutiny after several witnesses described how Trump leveraged access and military aid to secure a promise from Ukraine to launch investigations that could help his 2020 reelection bid.\u201d\n\n\u201cA person familiar with the discussions between the whistleblower and House investigators, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks, said Thursday that there are no active efforts to arrange for the individual\u2019s testimony.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead:\n\nDepositions previously scheduled for today were postponed due to services for Cummings.\n\nOn Saturday: \" \u2026 the panel will interview acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs Philip Reeker, who, according to [acting chief diplomat to Ukraine Bill] Taylor\u2019s testimony, was involved in early efforts to secure a meeting between Trump and [Ukranian President Volodymyr] Zelensky. According to internal documents the State Department\u2019s inspector general passed on to Congress earlier this month, Reeker also fielded concerns from other officials, including George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state in charge of Ukraine, about the effort to oust [ex-Ukraine Ambassador Marie] Yovanovitch from office,\u201d per Mike and Karoun.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney still has his job.

The conservatives hope to gather more than 45 signatures before delivering it to the White House, according to a source familiar with the letter.\u201d\n\nConservatives were responding to reports there was an effort by Trump and his allies to oust Mulvaney after a particularly rough week defending Trump in the Ukraine imbroglio.\n\nPower Up spoke with Perkins and McIntosh, two of the letter's signers, on Thursday evening, both of whom described the push to keep Mulvaney, an ex-South Carolina congressman and founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, in the White House as key to Trump maintaining open lines of communication with outside groups that support him, especially during an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cMick is a trusted member of the administration for all the different conservative groups including the Club For Growth,\u201d McIntosh told us, adding \u201cit's really important for the president to have around him people that know how the House operates\u201d in the middle of an impeachment investigation. \u201cI think Micks advice would be helpful,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI think it's important to have a solid movement conservative in the White House,\u201d Perkins told us. Trump \u201cneeds some continued stability and these relationships are working for the administration but every time there is a change it requires a lot of energy to get back up to speed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Trump's chief of staff: In a phone conversation about Trump's top aide potentially serving as Trump's next chief of staff, Kellyanne Conway berated, threatened, and disparaged Washington Examiner reporter Caitlin Yilek.\n\nYilek, to her credit, published the audio and transcript of the conversation that went off the rails, where Conway, \u201cdescribing herself as 'a powerful woman,' aggressively and disparagingly told a female reporter that it was improper to write about her husband and threatened to investigate the reporter's personal life,\u201d per Yilek.\n\nIn KAC's words: \u201cSo I just am wondering why in God\u2019s earth you would need to mention anything about George Conway\u2019s tweets in an article that talks about me as possibly being chief of staff. Other than it looks to me like there\u2019s no original reporting here, you just read Twitter and other people\u2019s stuff, which I guess is why you don\u2019t pick up the phone when people call from the White House because, if it\u2019s not on Twitter or it\u2019s not on cable TV, it\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\nThere's more: \u201cLet me tell you something, from a powerful woman. Don\u2019t pull the crap where you\u2019re trying to undercut another woman based on who she\u2019s married to. He gets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed. Not the other way around.
