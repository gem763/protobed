This action was said to have been taken in order to prevent Trump's comments from being disclosed to the public.\n\nThe revelation adds yet another layer to the list of controversial comments the US president made during the pivotal meeting.\n\nThe meeting took place one day after Trump fired then FBI director James Comey, who was investigating Russia's election meddling. The White House initially said Comey was dismissed because of the way he handled the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. But Trump revealed on national television that he fired Comey because of \"this Russia thing.\"\n\nDuring the meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak, Trump boasted that firing \"nut job\" Comey had taken \"great pressure\" off of him.\n\nHe also disclosed to the Russians classified intelligence about the Islamic State that had been provided by Israel, one of the United States' closest Middle Eastern allies.\n\nShortly after the meeting, the US extracted a top spy from Russia, CNN reported early this month.\n\nOfficials began being concerned about the asset's safety as the US learned the extent to which Russia was interfering in the 2016 election and as the media reported on it and started examining the CIA's sources in Kremlin, The New York Times reported. The CIA decided to offer to extract the spy in late 2016, before Trump took office.\n\nThe spy apparently refused, but officials' concerns were compounded when, in May 2017, Trump disclosed classified intel to the Russians during the Oval Office meeting, CNN reported.\n\nThe information Trump shared with the Russians wasn't directly connected to the source, and there is no evidence Trump endangered the spy. But CNN reported that its disclosure prompted officials to \"renew earlier discussions\" about the potential risk that the source would be exposed.\n\nIn particular, they were worried that Trump and his administration routinely mishandled classified information and that their actions could expose the covert source as a spy within the Russian government.", "description": "White House officials were said to have been alarmed by the remarks, and led them to regulate the number of people who had access to them.", "authors": ["David Choi", "Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8eab302e22af0223029206?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
