A lot of our listeners out there own AR-15s. Why should they not have one?\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"To be clear, they should have them,\" O'Rourke responded. \"If you purchased that AR-15, if you own it, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly.\"\n\nHe added later in the same interview: \"If you own a gun, keep that gun. Nobody wants to take it away from you -- at least I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d", "description": "Former congressman Beto O'Rourke\u00a0may be softening his signature stance on mandatory gun buybacks after suggesting he might consider\u00a0an exception for certain AR-15 owners.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
