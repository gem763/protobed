Rafael Reif said. The resignation was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nIto\u2019s resignation comes after The New Yorker reported late Friday that Media Lab had a more extensive fundraising relationship with Epstein than it previously acknowledged and tried to conceal the extent of the relationship.\n\nEpstein killed himself in jail Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Federal prosecutors in New York had charged the 66-year-old with sex trafficking and conspiracy, alleging he sexually abused girls over several years in the early 2000s.\n\nIn a letter to the MIT community Saturday, Reif called the allegations in The New Yorker \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation,\u201d Reif wrote. \u201cThis morning, I asked MIT\u2019s General Counsel to engage a prominent law firm to design and conduct this process.\u201d\n\nIto has also resigned from the boards of The New York Times Co. NYT, -0.33% , the MacArthur Foundation, and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, each announced.\n\nTimes publisher A.G. Sulzberger and the company\u2019s president, Mark Thompson, said in a companywide email Saturday that Ito has left the board \u201ceffective immediately.\u201d\n\nReif said last month that MIT took about $800,000 from Epstein over 20 years. That announcement followed the resignation of two prominent researchers from Media Lab over revelations the lab and Ito took money from Epstein after he served time a decade ago for sex offenses involving underage girls\n\nThe New Yorker reports Epstein arranged at least $7.5 million in donations, including $2 million from Microsoft founder Bill Gates and $5.5 million from investor Leon Black.\n\nAlthough MIT listed Epstein as \u201cdisqualified\u2019 in its donor database, the Media Lab did not stop taking gifts from him and labeled his donations as anonymous, The New Yorker reported, citing emails and other documents it obtained.\n\nLast week, Ito said Epstein gave him $525,000 for the Media Lab and another $1.2 million for his own investment funds.\n\nEpstein\u2019s July 6 arrest drew national attention, particularly focusing on a deal that allowed him to plead guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida and avoid more serious federal charges.\n\nEpstein was a wealth manager who hobnobbed with the rich, famous and influential, including presidents and a prince.\n\nHe owned a private island in the Caribbean, homes in Paris and New York City, a New Mexico ranch and a fleet of high-price cars.\n\nPhone and email messages seeking comment were left for Ito and Media Lab representatives Saturday.", "description": "The director of a prestigious research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology resigned Saturday, and the school\u2019s president ordered an independent...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ889_joiito_ZG_20190908190727.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
