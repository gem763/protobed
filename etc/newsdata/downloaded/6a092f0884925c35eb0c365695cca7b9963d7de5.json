I didn't feel like it was a performance.\u201d\n\nThe two were shooting a crucial scene: It's the only time we see Stiles\u2019s journalist character, Elizabeth, interview Lopez\u2019s Ramona, a stripper turned con artist. Ramona gives a moving speech about her friendship with Destiny (Constance Wu) that Stiles says was added at the eleventh hour. It seems director and writer Lorene Scafaria had a burst of inspiration, and the late-minute change didn't faze Lopez. \u201cJennifer learned it in like two minutes,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cShe closed her eyes and said, \u2018Okay, let's go.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was Stiles\u2018s first time seeing Lopez in the role. \"My jaw was dropping the whole time. That got me really excited about being a part of the movie.\"\n\nView photos Courtesy of STX Entertainment More\n\nStiles\u2018s place in the Hustlers canon is an interesting one. The movie, now in theaters, has earned critical and public praise for its nuanced depiction of a group of strippers who con their wealthy clients using a potent combo of drugs, booze, and sex appeal. It's a world of excess and schemes, but the audience is brought into it by the one character most outside of the action: Stiles\u2018s Elizabeth. As the reporter interviewing the women about their experiences, Elizabeth serves as a framing device\u2014learning about the complicated club politics as we do, reacting as we might when Destiny describes spiking the men's drinks in order to rob them.\n\nIt's a role that's more function than flash. Maybe that would turn off some actors seeking a buzzier part, but Stiles saw it as an opportunity to be a part of the bigger story. \u201cLorene didn't have to frame the film with me as the eyes and ears for the audience,\u201d Stiles explains. \u201cIt could have easily just been a voiceover. I think she stuck with having me as a catalyst to hopefully get the audience to open up and try to understand what these women were going through.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Stiles says, her agents warned her the part wasn't flashy when they sent over the script. But she loved Scafaria's vision\u2014and the article that inspired the film, written by Jessica Pressler\u2014and wanted to be a part of the movie in whatever way she could. She met with Scafaria for two hours, telling her \u201call the reasons I was fascinated by the story.\u201d Toward the end of their conversation, Scafaria asked if she had any lingering questions. Stiles\u2018s response: \u201cMy question is, what do I have to do to be in this movie?\u201d\n\nBesides, not playing a dancer isn\u2018t a big loss for Stiles. \u201cI don't want to say that I'd be too shy [to play a stripper], because I feel like that's shaming the women that do it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it would've taken a lot for me to have the guts to do that\u2014and balance on those stiletto platform heels. It would have taken a lot of training.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven't seen a film that I've been in in a long time where I was still thinking about it weeks afterwards.\u201d\n\nThat doesn't mean she didn\u2018t prep for the movie, of course. Stiles met with Pressler ahead of filming after reaching out to her on Instagram. Both women were working in New York at the time, but they had young kids and finding childcare was difficult. So, they arranged a play date. \u201cI brought my son over to her apartment, and he proceeded to destroy her living room while we talked about everything that led to this point.\u201d Stiles asked Pressler every question she could think of\u2014how she found out about the story, how she got in touch with the women, the process of turning it all into a film.\n\n\u201cThere were so many interesting anecdotes I took away from our meeting,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cbut I also really learned that she's got a lot of compassion for the people she writes about. She showed up at Rosie's\u2014the woman the Constance Wu character is based on\u2014with a box of cannoli as a sort of peace offering to say, \u2018I'm not here to trash you, and I'm not here to take advantage of you. I want to know more about you, the person. I'm on your side.\u2019\u201d Stiles says she'd also text Pressler during filming with questions like, \u201cHow much do you use a notepad?\u201d", "description": "In a movie about strippers conning their wealthy clients out of thousands of dollars, Julia Stiles plays a journalist outside the main action.
