Instead, she was covering the court fluidly until she twisted her knee while lunging for a wide forehand at 2-1 in the first set.\n\n\u201cMy knee twisted, I heard a crack, [the physio] validated me that it\u2019s my meniscus. I can\u2019t bend my knee at all. It\u2019s cracking every time I walk and it hurts,\u201d Andreescu said to her coach, Sylvain Bruneau. As he implored her not to push her injury too far, she cried: \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d\n\nShe spent the following half-hour teeing off on her groundstrokes while desperately trying to move her immobile leg. At one point, she saved three break points to hold for 3-3 and then celebrated by barking loudly down the court towards a bemused Pliskova. She fought hard, but Pliskova eventually stepped inside the court and used her experience to put away her ailing opponent in the first set.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nNaomi Osaka withdrew from the tournament with a right shoulder injury on Tuesday but the circumstances are more worrying for Andreescu. There are few doubts about the potency of her forehand, the fluidity of her movement and her tendency to enrage opponents with her variety but the 19-year-old\u2019s injury list is growing.\n\nThis year, Andreescu contested only one match between March and August owing to a torn rotator cuff injury and many of her 48 victories in 2019 have included numerous physio visits and extended periods of physical ailments.\n\nAfter losing to Andreescu at the Miami Open in March, the former world No 1 Angelique Kerber was incensed by her opponent\u2019s numerous injury claims and infamously branded the youngster \u201cthe biggest drama queen ever\u201d. The unfortunate irony is that Andreescu continues to prove Kerber wrong.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elina Svitolina powers a backhand at Simona Halep on her way to the last four of the WTA Finals.

Svitolina has been happy to hit consistently deep groundstrokes, forcing opponents to hit through both the court and her supreme defence in order to win.\n\nKiki Bertens makes most of late chance by beating world No 1 Ashleigh Barty Read more\n\nAfter Pliskova failed to put Svitolina away in their opening match, Halep spent this one frantically cycling through every last stroke in her arsenal, but she finished with 38 unforced errors and was unable to consistently dent the Ukrainian\u2019s armour.\n\nSvitolina has now qualified for the semi-finals, while the second spot in the Purple Group will be decided by the winner of Halep\u2019s contest with Pliskova on Friday.
