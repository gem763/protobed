Jet take-off from 82 feet \u2013 150dB Planes on aircraft carrier deck \u2013 140dB White bellbird \u2013 125dB Chainsaw \u2013 120dB Lion's roar \u2013 114dB Live rock music \u2013 110dB Car horn from three feet \u2013 110dB Pneumatic drill (jackhammer) \u2013 100dB Wolf howl \u2013 90dB Howler monkey \u2013 90dB Damaging to human ear \u2013 85dB Sources: Iac Acoustics and Australian Geographic\n\n'Maybe they are trying to assess males up close, though at the risk of some damage to their hearing systems.'\n\nThe bird emits a call which sounds like a buzzer and, in the video footage, starts off on one note then shifts to a higher one.\n\nIt holds its mouth wide open while it makes the sound and appears to be sitting at the highest point of a tree.\n\nIn comparison to other animals, the white bellbird's call is three times louder than the previous record holder among birds, the screaming piha.\n\nThe human ear begins to get damaged when it hears sounds from about 85dB \u2013 some 40dB lower than the bellbird's cry.\n\nStanding three feet away from a car horn when it goes off is equal to about 110dB, while a pneumatical drill \u2013 or jackhammer \u2013 is 100dB.\n\nA chainsaw is about 120dB and live rock music is about 110dB.\n\nThe researchers don't know how the bird can manage to make such a loud noise, but it clearly takes a significant effort.\n\nAs the calls get louder, Professor Podos and his colleagues noticed, they also become shorter \u2013 potentially because the birds run out of breath while doing it.\n\nThe bellbirds have unusually thick muscles in their abdomen and particularly strong ribs, which may help it to make the racket, the scientists said.\n\nProfessor Podos added: 'We don't know how small animals manage to get so loud. We are truly at the early stages of understanding this biodiversity.'\n\nThe research was published in the journal Current Biology.\n\nProfessor Podos said: 'We don't know how small animals manage to get so loud.
