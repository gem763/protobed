In Ad Astra, it\u2019s the ghost of the \u201cLima project\u201d that haunts Neptune\u2019s rings, after vanishing with its cataclysmic antimatter drive decades ago.\n\nThis time it\u2019s Brad Pitt rather than Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs or Laurence Fishburne (a veteran of Apocalypse Now) on the trail of the cosmic mystery, but the essential thematic coordinates are the same \u2013 a trip into deep space in search of a lost expedition that had gazed too long into the abyss. The result is an A-list B-movie that juggles moments of breath-taking visual splendour with much on-the-nose speechifying about sins of the fathers and eternal isolation, spiced up with some action-packed silliness that entirely undercuts its more po-faced pretensions.\n\nJust as the makers of Alien looked to Joseph Conrad when naming their spaceships Nostromo and Narcissus, so Gray and co-writer Ethan Gross use Marlow and Kurtz from Heart of Darkness as models for astronaut Roy McBride (Pitt) and his pioneering father Clifford (Tommy Lee Jones). As leader of the Lima project, Cliff \u201cwent further than any of us\u201d, travelling to the outskirts of the solar system before going off-grid \u2013 physically, morally, theologically. Now Roy (whose \u201cWhat did he find out there?\u201d narration might as well have been read by Martin Sheen) must follow Dad\u2019s path into the void. Will Roy be able to find the source of the electrical \u201csurges\u201d that are threatening life on Earth? Or will he simply come face to face with \u201cthe horror, the horror\u2026 \u201d?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tommy Lee Jones in Ad Astra.

Shot with widescreen majesty on 35mm, Ad Astra combines sinewy, space-bound sequences \u2013 all floating elegance and weightless wonder \u2013 with moments of shimmery inner stillness, reminiscent of Soderbergh\u2019s undervalued Solaris remake.\n\nThere are echoes of Gravity, too, as characters find themselves whirling kinetically in the disorienting emptiness of space. And then there\u2019s the trailer-teased encounter with a space-bound \u201crhesus primate\u201d \u2013 a WTF!? episode that bizarrely reminded me that 2001\u2019s visionary effects wiz Douglas Trumbull inherited the movie bug from his father, who rigged those freaky flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz. We may be in \u201cserious\u201d sci-fi territory, Toto, but we can still see Kansas from here...\n\nLike Ryan Gosling\u2019s insular Neil Armstrong in Damien Chazelle\u2019s First Man, Pitt\u2019s pathologically \u201ccompartmentalised\u201d hero has an almost android-like detachment from human emotions; love, fear, empathy. Indeed, this very quality makes him ideal for a mission that would drive a normal human being to distraction. Yet whereas Gosling\u2019s glazed stare silently suggested deep wellsprings of grief, Pitt gets to verbalise his inner torment in sub-Terrence Malick monologues, interspersed with perfume-ad footage of Liv Tyler, who seems to have wandered straight off the set of Michael Bay\u2019s Armageddon. While First Man was an object lesson in \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d film-making, Ad Astra seems determined to show and tell at every opportunity, right up to the hokey coda, which rivals the knot-tying antics of Insterstellar\u2019s all-too-neat final act.\n\nNone of which is to suggest that Ad Astra isn\u2019t very entertaining hokum. While Pella K\u00e5german and Hugo Lilja\u2019s Aniara more effectively evoked the existential horrors of being lost and alone in the universe, and Claire Denis\u2019s High Life played the inner/outer space riff with greater oddball conviction, neither of these superior films had the spectacular, crowd-pleasing appeal of Gray\u2019s pulpy epic. In a world in which Star Wars movies still rule the roost, it\u2019s encouraging to find an $80m space-based movie setting its artistic sights on the stars rather than simply recycling intergalactic horse-opera cliches. Yet with its lunar pirates, interplanetary shootouts and preposterous space leaps, Ad Astra owes as much to the legacy of those old Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s as any George Lucas fantasy franchise.\n\nAn atmospheric score by Max Richter (augmented by Lorne Balfe\u2019s \u201cadditional music\u201d) amplifies the air of intrigue, while Jones\u2019s saddlebag face and uber-grouchy delivery offer an effective counterpoint to Pitt\u2019s perennially wounded star-child pout.", "description": "Pitt\u2019s tormented astronaut goes in search of his long-lost father", "authors": ["Mark Kermode"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b879fc0ceab90888737387723609fb3bf4e1ff79/429_0_2859_1716/master/2859.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=21b4ac234feedce7443f351725f2fb4e", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
