Al Franken (D-Minn.) groped her in 2006 without her consent.\n\nThe unnamed woman told New York magazine in an article published Monday that Franken, who resigned in December 2017 after multiple women accused him of misconduct, grabbed her butt at an event in 2006, before he was elected senator. The accuser, identified as a military veteran who now works at a large progressive organization, told the magazine she was just out of college working her first job for Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) when the incident occurred.\n\n\u201cI was working the photo line, and he pulled me in,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMurray said, \u2018Let\u2019s take the picture.\u2019 And he puts his hand on my ass. He\u2019s telling the photographer, \u2018Take another one. I think I blinked. Take another one.\u2019 And I\u2019m just frozen. It\u2019s so violating. And then he gives me a little squeeze on my buttock, and I am bright red.\u201d\n\nFranken, who took office in 2009, resigned amid the anti-sexual violence reckoning spurred by the Me Too movement. He stepped down after several news organizations, including HuffPost, published allegations raised by a total of eight women who accused him of misconduct that included groping and forcible kissing.\n\nThe new allegation, from Franken\u2019s ninth accuser, is the fourth to accuse Franken of groping without consent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say anything at the time, but I felt deeply, deeply uncomfortable,\u201d the woman said. \u201cIt was such a confusing experience.\u201d\n\nThe woman said the experience made her question her aspirations to go to law school and run for public office. She explained to New York magazine that she didn\u2019t come forward when the initial accusations against Franken surfaced in 2017 because she feared future employers would hold it against her.\n\n\u201cI have dreams of being a Cabinet secretary for the first female president. I have dreams of running a large organization,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I believe that even in the most liberal, progressive organizations in the world, it will still be held against me.\u201d\n\nFranken, who recently began hosting his own show on SiriusXM, didn\u2019t deny the allegation.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, I would have sworn that I\u2019d never done anything to make anyone feel uncomfortable, but it\u2019s clear that I must have been doing something,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, I feel terrible that anyone came away from an interaction with me feeling bad.\u201d\n\nHead over to New York magazine to read the full story.\n\nRelated...\n\nKirsten Gillibrand Does 'Not Have Any Regrets' Over Al Franken's Resignation\n\nThe Real Story About The Allegations Against Al Franken\n\nLooks Like Al Franken's Career Comeback Is Complete\n\nNeed help?
