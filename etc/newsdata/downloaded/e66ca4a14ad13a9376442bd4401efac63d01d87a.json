The Daily Beast reports that CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker announced the news at an employee meeting; the network also confirmed it in a statement to the outlet. However, it says the policy may change in the future as health agencies continue to investigate the disease.\n\n\u201cGiven the recent news reports of serious illnesses and deaths linked to the product category and the subsequent warnings ... CNN has revised its policies regarding e-cigarette advertising, and will not air ads in this category effective immediately,\u201d a spokesperson told The Daily Beast. The ban might be lifted if \u201cnew facts come to light\u201d during the investigations.\n\nCigarette ads have been illegal for almost 50 years\n\nJuul and other e-cigarettes have been successfully marketed through social media. But Juul launched a multimillion-dollar campaign with TV, print, and radio ads this year. The Food and Drug Administration recently warned Juul that its claims \u2014 which present vaping as a less harmful or even \u201ctotally safe\u201d alternative to smoking \u2014 were not legally approved.\n\nSix people have reportedly died from a lung disease linked to vaping, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 380 \u201cconfirmed and probable\u201d cases have been identified across 36 states and the US Virgin Islands. More than 450 possible cases have been investigated. The exact cause of the disease is unclear \u2014 some reports have blamed illegally modified cannabis vapes, but health officials haven\u2019t ruled out a threat from legal nicotine e-cigarettes either. The CDC and American Medical Association have urged people to refrain from vaping altogether.\n\nSo far, e-cigarettes have often fallen outside the purview of existing tobacco laws. Regulation may be on its way, though. President Donald Trump suggested a ban of all non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, and some states and cities have already made them illegal.\n\nOverall, research on e-cigarettes\u2019 health effects is still highly incomplete. Some evidence suggests that they\u2019re less harmful than traditional cigarettes, but that\u2019s very different from being \u201csafe.\u201d And e-cigarettes, particularly ones from the dominant brand Juul, have become popular with teens who may later take up smoking at increased rates.\n\nCigarette ads have been banned from TV since 1970.", "description": "CNN will no longer run ads for e-cigarettes like Juul as investigators look into six deaths and hundreds of illnesses linked to vaping, and health agencies recommend avoiding the product.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RZwfgdfWHVjNNcejfafLAOaO6zQ=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11960209/acastro_180702_2708_juul_0003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
