Both sides are expected to sign a deal expanding a railway link between the Himalayan nation and Tibet.\n\nOli told Xi the country would oppose any \u201canti-China activities\u201d on its soil, CCTV reported.\n\nChina, which is trying to de-escalate a protracted trade war with the US, has seen its political authority tested by increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the Chinese-ruled city.\n\nPolice in Hong Kong have used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon against pro-democracy demonstrators in the former British colony, which has been plunged into its worst political crisis in decades.\n\nUS president Donald Trump had said it would be difficult to negotiate with China if anything \u201cbad\u201d happens in its handling of the Hong Kong protests.\n\nTrump said he discussed Hong Kong with Chinese vice premier Liu He on Saturday during their latest round of talks. Both sides reached a \u201cphase-one deal\u201d that has raised optimism for a broader agreement although many fundamental issues remained unresolved and existing tariffs are still not lifted.\n\nWashington last week also blacklisted 28 Chinese companies over Beijing\u2019s treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. China has faced growing international condemnation for over mass detention camps that are believed to hold more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims.\n\nBefore arriving in Nepal, Xi was in India for talks with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to try to mend ties over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir amid scattered anti-China protests from Tibetan groups.\n\nChina sent troops into remote, mountainous Tibet in 1950 in what it officially calls a peaceful liberation and has ruled there with an iron fist ever since.\n\nThe Dalai Lama, Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader, fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. China brands him a dangerous reactionary seeking to split off nearly a quarter of the Chinese land mass.", "description": "President sends warning to \u2018external forces\u2019 as country faces criticism over Hong Kong and repression in Xinjiang", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f769e2ef1b2c4a74cd896f6b47c2d453a9d64aad/0_237_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7fec962b817480225443db2fd722f2c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
