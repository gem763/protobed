'As I have start to break my silence, I want to start by saying now, I think they are the intelligence service, and I will be going to the police station to make an official complaint on Monday. Kind of regards, Salih Khater.' The reply, from 'Ben' in Membership services at the Labour Party, said: 'Thank you for your recent email to Jeremy Corbyn MP, the Leader of the Opposition.

'Please be assured that the comments of your correspondence have been noted and passed to the relevant members of Jeremy's team.

All the evidence is consistent with that conclusion.'\n\nThe court had heard how Khater was born in Sudan and was granted asylum in Britain in 2010, after claiming he had been tortured in his home country.\n\nIn the months before the attack, the defendant showed signs of 'paranoia' about British authorities, it was claimed.\n\nHe had failed his accountancy exams at the University of Coventry and his work as a security guard had dried up.\n\nOn May 24 last year, he emailed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to express concern about an 'event' involving the intelligence services, the court heard.\n\nThe day before the attack, Khater had travelled to Peterborough and unsuccessfully applied for a fast-track UK passport, the court heard.\n\nKhater crashed into barriers outside the Houses of Parliament where he was later arrested\n\nThe airbags in the Ford Fiesta as it crashed into the barriers outside Parliament on August 14 last year\n\nHe then set off from Birmingham to London just before 10pm, arriving after midnight.\n\nCCTV captured Khater arriving in Parliament Square just before 1am and driving around Westminster, checking the layout for the attack five or six hours later.\n\nHe then parked up and rested for four-and-a-half hours in Windmill Street in Soho before returning to Parliament Square.\n\nHe went on to do four laps of the square before launching the rush-hour attack.\n\nCrushed bikes on the road outside the Houses of Parliament after they were rammed by Khater\n\nPolice approach Khater's car by the gates of the Palace of Westminster (left) before opening his door to get him out (right)\n\nKhater is stopped by police outside Parliament before being hauled out of his car and arrested\n\nPedestrian Paul Brown was crossing the road when Khater's car 'came out of nowhere' and hit him, causing bruising and grazes.\n\nKrystof Tokarski and Anya Breen were cycling to work and were waiting at traffic lights when Khater revved his engine and knocked them down.\n\nMr Tokarski suffered grazes and a broken little finger while Ms Breen was thrown over the bonnet, fracturing her collar bone.\n\nMs Breen said: 'I saw it [the car] coming round the roundabout, I saw it turn towards the wrong way down the road, effectively on our side of the road.\n\nJenny Hopkins, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'It was only quick reactions and good luck that stopped Salih Khater killing anyone.' He is seen in a mug shot\n\n'It was being driven, it seemed to me, really consistently - at the same speed,' Ms Breen said.\n\n'I don't remember the impact, I remember up until it was quite close and then the next thing I remember is I was on the ground.\n\n'I remember just thinking, 'This is happening,' and it was a process of, 'Surely its going to stop? Surely its going to turn the other way?'\n\n'I couldn't move, I was very tense. I was just staring up, I could only see what was above me.'\n\nWitness Nicola Toner said she saw Ms Breen being knocked from her white Decathlon bike onto the car bonnet before hitting the ground.\n\nShe said: 'The girl appeared to be in a lot of pain, she was screaming and couldn't get up. When the girl was struck be the car she was about a meter-and-a-half from me.\n\n'At the time I burst into tears and I was properly in shock.'\n\nOther people were trapped under their bikes, with some screaming in pain.\n\nThe defendant made a sharp turn into a slip road, going 32mph, forcing Pc Darren Shotton and PC Simon Short to dive out of the way.\n\nAs armed police removed Khater from the car, the defendant confirmed he was acting alone but failed to explain himself.\n\nKhater leaving the Passport Office in Peterborough where he applied for a fast-track UK passport the day before he carried out the attack on August 13, 2018\n\nThe attacker (circled) driving around the area before the attack in an apparent recce for targets\n\nCommander Richard Smith, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: 'I am pleased at today's sentence and that an extremely dangerous individual will be behind bars for a considerable time.\n\n'This was a man who used his car as a weapon to attempt to kill as many people as possible spreading fear and terror. It was our view that this attack was carried out with a terrorist purpose and the sentence confirms this.'\n\nCommander Smith added: 'I would like to pay tribute to the outstanding professionalism and bravery of all the officers who responded to this incident.\n\nKhater at Westminster Magistrates Court on August 20, where he appeared before his Old Bailey trial\n\n'Armed officers were on the scene within seconds and would not have known what other dangers Khater may have posed. The response of those officers and, indeed, all emergency service responders to this incident was truly remarkable.'\n\nHe continued: 'My thoughts too are with all the victims of this terrible attack. Many were left with physical and psychological injuries, which are still impacting on their lives today. I only hope that today's outcome can give them some small comfort.'", "description": "CCTV images show Salih Khater, 30, driving around London before he ploughed his Ford Fiesta into a pedestrian and a group of cyclists in Parliament Square last year.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/18/19704662-0-image-a-10_1571075858977.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
