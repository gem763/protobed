Then, a notification pops up on your phone. In that split second, you decide to scroll through your social media feed instead.\n\nGetting into study mode can be a real struggle, but we\u2019ve got your back! Young Post interviewed Dr Janet Hsiao, Associate Professor at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s department of psychology, and asked her to recommend some brain exercises, that, over time, could help you revise better, and not get so distracted.\n\n5 ASMR artists to help you relax\n\nMeditation\n\nMeditation requires us to try to keep our minds from wandering and to focus our full attention on our breath. \u201cWhen practised regularly, meditation can boost our ability to focus on one thing and resist irrelevant information,\u201d Hsiao says.\n\nIn other words, it helps you to concentrate on studying and to stay away from unwanted distractions during revision. It\u2019s going to take a while for meditation to change how your brain is wired, but if this mindfulness (mind control) practice makes you become more aware of the things that draw your attention away from studying, why not spare 10 minutes a day for it \u2013 and get a little peace of mind, too?\n\nMindfulness can help you learn how keep your concentration while studying.

When it\u2019s your turn to play, you actually have to \u201ccoordinate sources of information and selectively focus on the pertinent information,\u201d explains Hsiao. Turns out playing games does help with studying!\n\nHow to take care of your mental health during the protests\n\nWord games\n\nYou might not think it, but playing word, guessing, and puzzle games with your friends might also help you study better. \u201cLike board or card games, they are good tools to strengthen your selective attention. As you\u2019re searching for the right word, you\u2019re also considering multiple words and you are shifting your attention constantly,\u201d Hsiao says.\n\nShe explains that attention-switching exercises are crucial for improving concentration, because they help you to switch back to what you\u2019re supposed to work on, as soon as your mind wanders. So word games are great for consolidating your working memory, as well as expanding your vocabulary.\n\nTeam sports\n\nThose who love being physically active can reap study benefits, too. When playing team sports like football and basketball, it\u2019s necessary to multitask, and to be highly focused to keep track of what team members are doing. For instance, when defending against your opponent or aiming for a goal, you need to ignore noises like cheers or yells from your opponents.\n\n\u201cThe process requires you to choose, coordinate and switch your attention between the various sources of information from your surroundings,\u201d Hsiao says. In the process, team training helps to sharpen your attention which helps you focus when studying.\n\nTeam sports make it necessary for you to multitask.

Instead of focusing on only one, it may be better, and much more fun, to actually try a variety of different brain exercises.\n\nThat way, you\u2019ll be able to find out what works best for you, while also kick-starting good study habits.", "description": "If you're having a hard time getting into study mode, these brain exercises will keep you from getting distracted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/happyteenagers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
