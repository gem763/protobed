We\u2019ll do our research... to make sure we know what threats they pose in what areas of the pitch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready for that. If they kick loosely to us, we will be ready. We back our counter-attack skills.\u201d\n\nWatson said England would also have to be focussed when dealing with Argentina\u2019s dangerous crosskicks.\n\n\u201cYou have to be completely aware of the positioning of your opposition wing or fullback, keep looking up and communicating with your backfield players to make sure someone\u2019s covering, or you are.\n\n\u201cSpace does appear at times and you have to react to either take advantage or nullify it. Wingers have to communicate with the guys inside them to let them know where there is space so they can execute the kicks to where you want them.\u201d\n\nWatson said the return to fitness of Exeter Chiefs winger Jack Nowell from an ankle injury was a welcome boost as Eddie Jones\u2019s side look to continue their winning ways having beaten Tonga and the United States.\n\n\u201cYou only have to see how many people he beat \u2014 it must have been 12-15 \u2014 in the time he was on the pitch for the Premiership final (against Saracens),\u201d Watson said.\n\n\u201cHe is a very special player and will be driving the back three players along. He looks very sharp.\u201d", "description": "England will face a stern test of their communication and co-ordination skills as they attempt to counter Argentina's kicking threat in Saturday's Rugby World Cup Pool C clash, winger Anthony Watson said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436191455&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910OQ"}
