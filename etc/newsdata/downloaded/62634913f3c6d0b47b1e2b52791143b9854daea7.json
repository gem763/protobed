In the annals of education, middle school often is disregarded. Mary Beth Schaefer, an education scholar at St. John\u2019s University, has studied the progress of the movement to better accommodate middle schoolers over a 50-year period beginning in the 1960s. Schaefer tells a story of fits and starts: Efforts to reform middle school regularly made their way into national policy debates, but those conversations always dissipated quickly, resulting in stagnation or even skepticism of the cause\u2019s validity. Middle School Journal, Schaefer notes, dropped by close to 100 pages per volume from 2010 to 2013. And yet we know that middle school is a pivotal time for children, whose bodies and minds develop more rapidly during early adolescence than at any stage other than the first two years of life.\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t help that adults often dismiss middle school as the nightmare they remember it to be. \u201cThey tend to fear this precarious age range,\u201d Cruz, the D.C. principal, says. \u201c[Adults] misunderstand those years\u201d as a chapter that these days is defined by sexting and narcissism, poor critical thinking, and civic apathy.\n\n\u201cAdults want to control,\u201d Cruz says. And that may be why grown-ups struggle to adequately serve middle schoolers, whom she describes as \u201cconsistently inconsistent.\u201d Yet Cruz is optimistic that middle school could be great.\n\nOne easy fix: a little bell-schedule rejiggering so that middle-schoolers can fuel their growing appetites when their bodies need it. Cruz\u2019s school, Oyster-Adams, decided to implement a 20-minute snack break at 10:45 a.m. so the district\u2019s existing lunchtime for the school (which also serves younger grades on another part of campus) wouldn\u2019t leave her with hangry tweens. Another change: Middle-school classrooms should budget for air conditioning\u2014tween bodies do not smell or feel good when it\u2019s stuffy inside. Of course, the structural changes that benefit one community of preteens may not make sense in another.\n\nRead: Have smartphones destroyed a generation?\n\nOne common denominator across the middle-school crisis is a simple empathy deficit. \u201cLittle people have all the feelings that adults have\u2014[just] with way less world experience,\u201d Cruz says. The principal told me parents of younger students elsewhere on campus often complain to her about the middle schoolers cursing and being haughty when they \u201cdrop off my innocent, little, tiny fourth grader.\u201d She addresses the issue, but when this happens she thinks to herself: denial. \u201cEverybody struggles with [early adolescence],\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can just skip that.\u201d She often notices a similar attitude in public spaces\u2014when adults are on a bus with middle schoolers, for example, they often glare and shake their heads at the tweens, who if they\u2019re in a group are very likely causing a ruckus. But those insolent preteens? \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be your kid in a few years!\u201d Cruz thinks to herself. Or: \u201cI bet you acted kind of like that [in middle school], too.\u201d\n\nThe middle-school movement has experienced somewhat of a resurgence in recent years. For these efforts to be successful, adults will have to embrace the messiness that is middle school. Tweenhood is torturous, and tending to those in the midst of it can be excruciating and embarrassing: Tweens will make lots of mistakes, and they\u2019ll learn from them, and still make more mistakes after that. Yet those mistakes\u2014and the growth that follows\u2014are precisely what give middle school its meaning.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
