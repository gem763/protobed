In the end, you will be a stronger, more expanded, even happier version of yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day I just kept telling myself to trust, trust, trust. And trust I did,\u201d Dewan added. \u201cThe news of our divorce didn\u2019t drown me. Not to any extent I couldn\u2019t handle, anyway. When I was ready, I started dating someone amazing \u2026 Lo and behold, everything started flowing together.\u201d\n\nFears of revealing she and Channing had split\n\nDewan wrote that it was difficult keeping her and Tatum's split private after realizing how much everyone idolized their relationship.\n\n\u201cThe public saw Channing and me in this idealized, romanticized light,\u201d she said. \u201cThis made things difficult for me, because I like being as honest and real as I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople in the World of Dance audience would ask, \u2018Where\u2019s Channing today?\u2019 or \u2018When are you two going to dance together again?\u2019\" she continued (via Us Weekly). \"I had to play these questions off while grappling with the truth of what was happening,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLet me tell you firsthand, when it comes to the lives of celebrities, a picture never tells the whole story. Everyone struggles. Every couple has their issues, celebrity or not.\u201d\n\nEXES CHANNING TATUM AND JENNA DEWAN REUNITE FOR HALLOWEEN\n\n\u201cThere was a point before Channing and I announced our separation where I thought, \u2018How in the world will everyone handle this?\u2019 The public had known us as a couple forever, and not just a couple \u2014 the perfect couple,\u201d Dewan said.\n\n\u201cHow would people at work react when I went in the next day? Would they pity me? Assume the post had happened?\" she added. \"I was scared of everything that would follow our coming out. \u2026 The news of our divorce didn\u2019t drown me.

Not only was I fighting an emotional battle of having to let go and move forward in my life, I was learning things about my ex most people wouldn\u2019t have to face \u2013 and over the Internet, as it was happening,\" she explained (via Entertainment Tonight).\n\nDewan continued: \"There I was, on a plane, alone, finding out about his new relationship. \u2026 Choosing grace as I learned everything about my personal situation along with the rest of the world was really difficult.\"\n\nDating as a single mom\n\nAfter her split from Tatum, the star dancer had fears about dating as a single mother, and worried about her and Tatum's 6-year-old daughter, Everly, adjusting.\n\n\u201cOn top of that the pressure were my fears of moving forward. What would that look like? Dating\u2026? Then there was my daughter,\u201d she said of Everly, whom she shares joint custody with Tatum (via Us Weekly). \u201cShe\u2019s very shy and funny and standoffish with men. It takes her a long time to warm up to others. I predicted this child was going to be jealous of whoever else I spent my time with. How would I ever date with her blessing? My fears were going haywire.\u201d\n\nJENNA DEWAN TO HOST FORTHCOMING DATING SHOW 'FLIRTY DANCING'\n\nSteve Kazee\n\nShe also gushed about her current beau, with whom she's expecting a child with.\n\n\u201cWhen I was ready, I started dating someone amazing,\u201d Dewan gushed (via Page Six). \u201cIt was this cosmically great thing where we circled back around each other after a moment of instant recognition years ago.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe two went public in September 2018.", "description": "The 38-year-old's new book, \"Gracefully You,\" is filled with\u00a0details about her divorce\u00a0from\u00a0ex Channing Tatum, her healing journey and\u00a0stepping back\u00a0into the dating scene again as a single mom.", "authors": ["Viktoria Ristanovic"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/JennaDewan1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
