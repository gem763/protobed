An ambulance was called for at 8.30am.\n\nThe baby was discovered on the morning of Friday the 27th of September, police and ambulance services were called shortly afterward\n\nFollowing attendance from paramedics, police were called and arrived at 9.07am.\n\nA spokesperson for the prison could not comment directly on the incident but said that the prison does have a mother and baby unit and that they would have offered 'appropriate support' to any inmate that made the prison aware they were pregnant.\n\nSurrey police said in a statement: 'The death is currently being treated as unexplained and an investigation is continuing to establish the full circumstances of what happened.'\n\nHMP Bronzefield is fitted with a mother and baby unit that would have been made available to the inmate, had she alerted staff to her condition\n\nVicky Robinson, Director at HMP Bronzefield, said: 'We can confirm that a woman at HMP Bronzefield gave birth on 27 September but sadly the baby did not survive.'\n\n'We are supporting the mother through this distressing time and our thoughts are with her, her family and our staff involved.'\n\n'We are undertaking a full review and working with all relevant authorities during their investigations. It would not be appropriate to comment any further.'\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Dr Kate Paradine, the chief executive of the charity Women in Prison, said: 'All mothers should have the right to give birth in dignity.'\n\n'Time and time again, we hear of situations where this isn't happening, with mothers regularly being denied access to the vital health and maternity care necessary to give birth safely. This has devastating consequences not only for the baby and mother, but also for the rest of the family they are separated from.'\n\nHMP Bronzefield is the UK's largest female-only prison, capable of housing up to 557 inmates.\n\nThe investigation is currently ongoing at this time.", "description": "An investigation has been launched by police following the death of a baby after a female inmate at HMP Bronzefield gave birth alone in her cell last week.", "authors": ["John Bennett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19302596-0-image-a-30_1570201491334.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
