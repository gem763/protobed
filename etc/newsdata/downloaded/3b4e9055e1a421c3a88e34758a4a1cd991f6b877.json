On the night of her murder, Ellerin had been due to go on a date with actor Ashton Kutcher, who testified at the trial.\n\nThe second murder victim was Maria Bruno, a 32-year-old mother of four and neighbor of Gargiulo who was attacked in her sleep in December 2005 and \u201cquite literally butchered,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nThose who testified at the trial included Gargiulo\u2019s teenage son, who pleaded with the jury to spare his dad\u2019s life, and Michelle Murphy. She was stabbed eight times in her home by Gargiulo in April 2008 but survived.\n\nMurphy said she woke up on that fateful night to find a man straddling her while he stabbed her in the arms and chest. She managed to fight him off and as he fled from the apartment he yelled \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she testified.\n\nProsecutors during the trial described Gargiulo, an air-conditioning repairman, as a ruthless killer who targeted women who lived near him and waited for the perfect opportunity to attack them at night in or near their homes in \u201ctotally planned killings.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d actor Kutcher told jurors he had gone to Ellerin\u2019s home in Hollywood to pick her up for a date on the night she was murdered, but had arrived late and nobody had answered the door.\n\nHe said he had looked through a window and seen what he thought was red wine spilled on the floor before leaving, assuming she had already gone out.\n\nKutcher said he and Ellerin, a fashion design student, were acquaintances.\n\nGargiulo was arrested following the attack on Murphy in 2008 in her Santa Monica apartment.\n\nHis defense team has argued that he should not get the death sentence, describing their client as a mentally ill man who suffered abuse while growing up.\n\nWhen his trial in Los Angeles ends, Gargiulo is set to be transferred to Illinois where he is facing charges for the 1993 murder of Tricia Pacaccio, 18, who was killed in front of her home after an evening out with friends.\n\nGargiulo at the time lived near Pacaccio\u2019s home in the Chicago area and was friends with her brother. Years after the murder, when Gargiulo was already living in Los Angeles, his DNA was matched to the crime scene thanks to improved testing methods.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 A jury in California recommended the death sentence on Friday for a man dubbed the \u201cHollywood Ripper\u201d who was", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/90051b_prosecutors-michael-gargiulo-an-air-conditioning-repairman-pictured-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
