Photo: Lindsay Lohan/Instagram\n\nLindsay Lohan \u2014 former teen actor, child model, app maker, nightclub owner, and reality-TV star \u2014 can now add filmmaker to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Retaining her title of singer-songwriter after teasing a comeback song last month, Lohan posted a full cut of new single \u201cXanax\u201d to her Instagram, along with an apparently homemade music video. The thumbnail-sized video features footage of boys skating in a skate park (giving us extreme mid-aughts vibes), what appears to be some sort of diplomatic meeting (with the president of Turkey, perhaps?), and a teenage boy saying, \u201cBecky is such a bitch! She always yells at me for \u2026 wearing a sweatshirt \u2019cause it ruins my hair. It\u2019s like, this is my hair, bitch! This is my fucking hair, bitch! Don\u2019t you fucking dare!\u201d The song itself, featuring Miley Cyrus and Charli XCX collaborator Alma along with a sample of 1998 dance hit \u201cBetter Off Alone\u201d by Alice Deejay, is sure to find a home in gay clubs everywhere this fall. Lohan even halfway commits to a pre-chorus count off: \u201cOnly one reason I came here / Too many people I can\u2019t here / Damn, I got here at 10 / Now it\u2019s 4 a.m.\u201d\n\nWhat does it all mean? Well, that\u2019s a question for the auteur herself, who writes, \u201cThis video is a compilation of vignettes of life. Family, love, the process of moving forward and letting go of the past. To live and be happy, free of fear. Just to be grateful and open our eyes to our opportunities instead of numbing the mind\ud83d\udc8b.\u201d Try to make sense of it for yourself below.", "description": "Lindsay Lohan released an apparently homemade music video and full-length version for her comeback single \u201cXanax\u201d on Instagram.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/25/25-lindsay-lohan-music-video.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
