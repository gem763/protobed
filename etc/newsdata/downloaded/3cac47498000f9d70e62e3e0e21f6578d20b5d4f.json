This is evidence of crimes,\" the Swedish police officer told the press conference.\n\nThe images were contained in the International Child Sexual Exploitation database that Interpol set up nearly a decade ago, leading to the identification of 12 000 victims.\n\nBut Sellstrom said many more could be identified as less than half of the world's countries are connected to the database, with none in Africa and only a few in Asia.\n\nThe system's sophisticated software compares photos and videos, allowing investigators to also identify abusers and locations across the participating member states.\n\nNearly 47% of the files in the database portray child victims that have been identified by the authorities while the remainder depict unidentified children.\n\nEuropol and Ecpat called for a coordinated global response involving civil society, media, academia and various layers of government.\n\n\"This is not a law enforcement problem. This is a societal problem,\" Sellstrom said.\n\n\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHow to know your child is being abused\n\nToo young to have babies?
