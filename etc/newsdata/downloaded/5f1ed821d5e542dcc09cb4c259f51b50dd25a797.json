But we will WIN!\"\n\nHouse Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) appeared on CNN shortly after the tweet was posted and appeared visibly agitated by Trump\u2019s use of the term.\n\n\u201cI really believe this man is prone to inflammatory statements, and that is one word no president ought to apply to himself,\u201d Clyburn said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve studied presidential history quite a bit, and I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever seen anything quite like this,\u201d he continued. \u201cAndrew Johnson never would have described what was happening to him this way, and certainly Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonHouse Democrat pledges 'there will be open hearings' in impeachment inquiry Democrats dig in ahead of Supreme Court ruling on 'Dreamers' Even with likely Trump impeachment, Democrats face uphill climb to win presidency MORE didn\u2019t, nor did Nixon.\u201d\n\nSeveral other black lawmakers decried Trump invoking lynching in discussing a political process.\n\nRep.

What the hell is wrong with you?\" the congressman tweeted. \"Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you.\u201d\n\nRep.

But never should we use terms like \u2018lynching\u2019 here. The painful scourge in our history has no comparison to politics, and @realDonaldTrump should retract this immediately. May God help us to return to a better way,\u201d Kinzinger tweeted.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet likening impeachment to \u201clynching\u201d comes one day after he called on Republicans to more vociferously defend him against the impeachment investigation.\n\n\"The two things they have: They\u2019re vicious and they stick together,\" Trump said of Democrats during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. \"They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyTrump urges GOP to fight for him Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan Romney earns rants and raves for secret Twitter name MORE in their midst. They don\u2019t have people like that.\"\n\nBut Trump\u2019s latest remark is likely to make that difficult. While Republicans are largely against impeaching Trump and have presented a unified front on that issue, they have struggled to deal with a wave of self-inflicted controversies caused by the White House in recent weeks.\n\nMany are displeased with Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops from northern Syria \u2013 a decision that effectively paved the way for a Turkish military operation against U.S.-allied Kurds \u2013 and pushed back last week on his since-reversed decision to host the Group of Seven (G-7) summit at his Doral resort.\n\nSen.
