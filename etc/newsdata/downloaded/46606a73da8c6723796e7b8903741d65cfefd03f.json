Other than a litany of other potential murder weapons and/or murder locations, that is.\n\nDeadline reports that the Ozark star is currently in talks to direct and potentially co-star \u2014 alongside Deadpool/Detective Pikachu himself, Ryan Reynolds \u2014 in a new adaptation of the beloved board game for Hasbro\u2019s Allspark Productions at Fox (n\u00e9e Disney).\n\nBoth Bateman and Reynolds will also work on the script for the movie, which will, presumably, be about a murder at a fancy estate where a cast of wonderfully colour-coordinated potential killers must figure out who offed who with what, and where. Meanwhile Reynolds will produce through his Maximum Effort banner alongside Hasbro.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Hasbro is moving full steam ahead with the adaptation \u2014 which there have been murmurs around for years at this point \u2014 given it\u2019s already fully intent on turning as many of its toy properties as it can, from G.I.
