It's super sexy and ominous'", "language": "en", "text": "His brutalist furniture has been inspired by rocks and bunkers. But the designer known for his gothic aesthetic has created a new range with a warmer influence \u2013 his mother\u2019s homeland of Mexico. Has the \u2018Donald Judd of fashion\u2019 gone soft?\n\nThis year, designer Rick Owens and his partner Mich\u00e8le Lamy went to Mexico for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve never really explored my Mexican heritage, even though my mother was from there,\u201d says Owens. \u201cBut I was thinking about using it for my next clothing collection.\u201d He returned to Paris inspired by what he\u2019d seen. \u201cNot the pi\u00f1atas and the Frida Kahlo Mexico,\u201d he says. \u201cMore the hot colours that Luis Barrag\u00e1n used, and Aztec architecture, and the photographs that Josef and Anni Albers took there in the 1930s, which I saw at the Guggenheim in Venice last year. Loud colours. And sequins.\u201d Sequins? Colours? From the man who loves grey? \u201cYeah! I\u2019m a flashy guy!\u201d he giggles.\n\nAnother, rather different, strand of influence emerged from the trip, seen in a new furniture collection that launched in London at Carpenters Workshop on 16 September. \u201cWe went to the cenotes in Tulum,\u201d says Owens of the underground cave systems. \u201cThere was something about the enclosed spaces that felt insulated and grand at the same time.\u201d Channelled through the designer\u2019s brain, this culminated in a work called Glade \u2013 seating units that form an enclosed monochromatic landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hole in a forest,\u201d says Owens, \u201cwhich is what a glade is.\u201d The seating, made with ply and covered in the grey vintage army blankets that have appeared in his work for two decades, comes fitted with internet and lighting connections. \u201cI like the option of putting a hundred of them together,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could fill a stadium with them. It\u2019s like my version of wallpaper.\u201d\n\nOwens\u2019 clothing designs and muscly-goth image might imply a certain transgressive darkness, but his conversation is sparklingly bright, and runs from Egyptian sarcophagi (a regular stop on Louvre visits) to Cher videos (his favourite is Hell on Wheels, in which the singer wears a zebra-striped leotard over cycling shorts and rollerskates to a truck stop full of drag queens). When we talk, he is in his office in Paris\u2019s classy 7th arrondissement. (He chose the area for its \u201cimperious\u201d quality.) Lamy is in London, installing Glade at Carpenters\u2019 Mayfair gallery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A fur on a rock in a cave\u2019\u2026 Owens\u2019 Prong stool. Photograph: Carpenters Workshop Gallery\n\nWhile Owens comes up with the furniture concepts, it is Lamy \u2013 who cuts an equally unusual figure with her khol-rimmed eyes, dye-stained fingers and diamond-studded gold teeth \u2013 who carries them forward. \u201cI do a few shapes, then she responds,\u201d says Owens. \u201cI might do sketches, maybe a cardboard sculpture. Then she goes to the workshop, which is an hour outside Paris, and works her magic. She likes constructing things \u2013 the bigger the better. Give her a crane, she\u2019d be thrilled.\u201d A series of eight Aztec-inspired crowns, which Lamy has also developed, cross the divide between the furniture and the clothes. They will be seen in the exhibition and on the catwalk in October. Owens describes them as \u201cimprobable and poetic\u201d.\n\nOwens considers the furniture to be his couture line. \u201cIt\u2019s custom-ordered, it moves at a stately pace,\u201d he says. \u201cMe, I like the speed of fashion, though partly because I have the privilege of being in charge of my own company.\u201d Owens is just about the only thriving fashion house in Paris not to have been subsumed by a conglomerate. \u201cI don\u2019t have the pressure of bosses observing what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t know how those guys do it. But it\u2019s thrilling to watch as a competitive sport, the way the players are traded.\u201d\n\nOwens started his label in Los Angeles in 1994 and later teamed up with Lamy, who ran the Les Deux Cafe over the road from his studio on Las Palmas Avenue, first working as a pattern cutter for her fashion line. The pair moved to Paris in 2003 and married in 2006.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rick Owens with his wife and business partner Mich\u00e8le Lamy. Photograph: Danielle Levitt\n\nOwens describes his earlier aesthetic as drippy. \u201cThere was a collapse implied and a sense of melancholy,\u201d he says of the draped clothing, the sleeves that extended beyond the fingers. By his own admission, there was a lot of partying and drugs back then. \u201cBut as I got healthier and happier, there was a joyfulness in working with shapes. When you drape it\u2019s always about creating extensions and exaggerating lines. I still drape, but now there is more strength in what I do.\u201d Owens, then as now, looks to fashion\u2019s archetypes \u2013 armour, uniforms, T-shirts. \u201cI want to be the Donald Judd of fashion,\u201d he says, referencing the American minimalist master. \u201cI have a very rigorous set of shapes and forms I keep going back to.\u201d\n\nWhen he started, his impulse was to think of furniture at its most reductive. \u201cI thought [of] a fur on a rock in a cave,\u201d he says. From this came the Prong stool. \u201cIt\u2019s a boulder,\u201d he says of the stool, which has been made in concrete, marble and now aluminium. \u201cThe facets are influenced by the old bunkers that stand on the Normandy coast. They look like futurist temples.\u201d\n\nOwens\u2019 and Lamy\u2019s furniture is often brutally restrained and bare. The materials are immutable \u2013 bronze and concrete, alabaster and marble. Kanye West has a table made in another favourite \u2013 petrified wood. \u201cI love basalt and alabaster,\u201d says Owens. \u201cThey\u2019re almost biblical and primitive. When I\u2019m making furniture I think of timelessness and I think of clothes that way too. The way they drape on the body has a classical influence.\u201d The plywood of Glade, though, is its antithesis. \u201cIt\u2019s opposite, transient. Like a Scotch Tape version of something.\u201d\n\nTheir home decor is brutalist too, with concrete floors and raw walls in Paris. Their beachside penthouse in Venice is lined with pale Sardinian stone. \u201cIt was very World of Interiors when we took it on, with a patchwork of 1940s tiled floors and Scarpa-style doors,\u201d says Owens. \u201cWe lived in it like that for one summer, then we ripped it all out. There are floor-to-ceiling mirrored doors \u2013 you slip in and out of them, as though they\u2019re mirrored walls.\u201d\n\nThe couple dine at the Aman Hotel in the 16th-century Palazzo Papadopoli. They travel by a water taxi that has been fitted out with a huge portable stereo, kept specially on charge for these journeys, that pumps out hard techno. Or Cher. \u201cI\u2019m not a foodie,\u201d says Owens. \u201cI don\u2019t like those little places with low ceilings, where everyone tells you the food is wonderful but the bathroom is on the other side of a paper-thin wall. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d In Venice he eats fish and vegetables. In Paris he eats cakes, because he likes the craftsmanship of their creation. \u201cBut really, I have cheap taste. I like cheese and ice cream. The sluttier the better.\u201d\n\nThis tension between taste and tackiness, control and collapse, is encapsulated in his growing love of art nouveau. \u201cWe all strive to reach a higher level of serenity, and there\u2019s always the danger of giving in to our id, our weaknesses,\u201d says the regular gym-goer. \u201cThat\u2019s what art nouveau is, a lugubrious collapse. So it\u2019s super sexy, and ominous, and it\u2019s the only stuff I buy. We all need a little disruption. Don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nGlade is at Carpenters Workshop until 25 October", "description": "His brutalist furniture has been inspired by rocks and bunkers.
