That left more than 26,000 students who had the exemptions with the choice to either receive the shots or be homeschooled.\n\nThe Seneca County suit is one of at least a dozen pending legal challenges.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A judge has reserved decision on a request to block a New York law that eliminated religious exemptions for student vaccines.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
