But in the state Senate, which approved the requirement, such training hasn\u2019t been conducted for legislators and staff in the Capitol since March of last year.\n\nWhile state employees have been required to undergo sexual harassment training for years, the 2018-19 state budget updated specific terms and conditions and required training for all public and private-sector workers in New York. The measure, signed into law on April 12, 2018, gave employers until Oct. 9, 2019 to fulfill the mandate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Democrats took control of the Senate last January and have not held any anti-harassment training since, meaning the chamber has not offered sessions for more than 18 months and not since the new law took effect. Sexual harassment in the workplace has been a banner item for Senate Democrats, who held a series of hearings and advocated for additional reforms after gaining control of the chamber.\n\n\u201cIt turns out the Senate Democrats were so busy patting themselves on the back for passage of their radical leftist agenda that they neglected to offer anti-sexual harassment training to all Senate employees, as required by law,\u201d said Scott Reif, a spokesperson for the Senate Republicans. \u201cAfter the horrors we\u2019ve witnessed both inside and outside the Legislature in recent years, this should have been a top priority. It clearly wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDemocratic majority spokesperson Mike Murphy said the conference is in compliance with the new law if it holds training before the end of the year. Murphy pointed to state guidance that gives employers discretion to choose the specific dates for meeting the \u201cannual\u201d requirement, whether that\u2019s based on the calendar year, the anniversary of each employee\u2019s start date, or another chosen date.\n\nMurphy said the conference views the training as a once-per-calendar year requirement, with the March 2018 training counting for that year. Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, all senators and employees will complete live or web-based training before the end of 2019, he said.\n\n\u201cI think the Senate Republicans should take some time and do some self-evaluation and apologize for the years and years of delay in addressing this crisis by blocking all meaningful reforms,\u201d Murphy said in response to Reif\u2019s statement.\n\nStill, that time table is different from the rest of the state\u2019s public and private workers, who should have completed training by today in accordance with state law. It's also different from procedures in the Assembly, which mandates in-person training for members once per term, based on when members were elected, lawmakers said. Speaker Carl Heastie completed his mandatory sexual harassment training on March 18, 2019, according to Assembly spokesperson Kerri Biche.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office did not provide a date or details for his or his office\u2019s sexual harassment training, but a spokesperson said the governor was up-to-date in completing an interactive session to prevent harassment in his workplace.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is current on his training and believes that expanding the state\u2019s longstanding practice of providing annual and comprehensive anti-sexual harassment training to all employees will help ensure workers know their rights and that such abuse will no longer be tolerated in the workplace,\" said Caitlin Girouard.\n\nCompliance for the law is difficult to track, with no real way for the state to ensure the training has occurred unless a complaint is brought and investigated. And advocates say that while proper implementation and enforcement will likely take time, the heart of the matter is re-framing the way harassment claims are addressed.\n\n\u201cWhat I can say is that enforcing training that isn\u2019t quality and victim-informed is useless,\u201d said Elizabeth Crothers, a member Sexual Harassment Working Group, which consists of former legislative staffers who have pushed for changes to state harassment law.", "description": "Workers statewide were to undergo training by today.
