There are certainly enough \u201crebel alliance\u201d votes to pass it \u2013 the only question is whether there are other devices the government can deploy to stop it. If it is passed, it will complete all its Commons stages in a few hours, and will then go to the House of Lords, which is also likely to pass it, although how long that will take no one knows.\n\nIn a defiant response to tonight\u2019s vote, Johnson said that, although he didn\u2019t want a general election, \u201cif this bill is passed tomorrow, the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on 17 October\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

That vote is expected to take place on Wednesday evening, as soon as the Benn bill passed the Commons.\n\nBut there is a problem.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nAfter a day of confusion about Labour\u2019s position, Jeremy Corbyn responded to Johnson\u2019s demand for an election by saying the Benn bill had to become law first. \u201cFine,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cGet the bill through first in order to take no deal off the table.\u201d\n\nSo it may be that the vote to hold an early election won\u2019t be held until Monday, to give the House of Lords time to complete the passage of the bill. I understand that Monday is the last day that parliament can sit if the election is to be held on 15 October. The government\u2019s original plan was for the election to be on 14 October, but that would have required parliament to be dissolved before Monday, as the law requires one day for dissolution and 25 working days for the election period. (Also, 14 October is a Jewish holiday, on which some observant Jews are forbidden to work, which includes voting).\n\nWhat is interesting is that Corbyn seems happy to go along with an election as long as it is held before Brexit day, so that an incoming Labour government could presumably ask for an extension to the deadline in order to negotiate a better deal.\n\nThis will upset a lot of Remainer Labour MPs, who were hoping to force Johnson to secure the extension and then to hold an election after that. They fear either that Corbyn will lose the election \u2013 which would give Johnson a mandate for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 or that he will win it and still try to take Britain out of the EU, although that would, under Labour\u2019s new policy, now be subject to a further referendum.\n\nAs it is, prepare for an election in five weeks\u2019 time.", "description": "Boris Johnson may be the first prime minister since Pitt the Younger in 1793 to lose his first vote in the House of Commons.
