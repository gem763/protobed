There are others.\n\nBefore this international break, England boss Gareth Southgate asked for us not to judge other nations as we still haven\u2019t got our own house in order.\n\nHow right he was.\n\nIf you look closer to home, then you will see just how deep that problem runs in our own country.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nA staggering 78,473 arrests were made last year for racism and hate crimes.\n\nTo save you a job, I\u2019ll work out the maths.\n\nThat\u2019s over 1,500 every week and over 200 each day.\n\nSo, on average, there are 200 people involved in racially-aggravated incidents every 24 hours in this country \u2013 and we are worried about 40 idiots at a football match in Bulgaria?\n\nI say it again: It\u2019s hypocrisy of the highest order.\n\nThe only reason I know this is because a BBC newsreader trotted out the statistics as part of her seven-minute report on Bulgaria.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt was a throwaway line \u2013 that there had been an 11 per cent rise since last year.\n\nA sentence that took about five seconds to say, out of the six minutes and 55 seconds that were devoted to what happened in Sofia.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe the figures.\n\nA few days later, after those heartfelt pleas on Question Time, not one commentator highlighted what had happened.\n\nNone of those who were so outraged by what had taken place in Bulgaria saw fit to comment and give the issue some perspective in light of what was going on here.\n\nPersonally, I think it is getting worse. The figures back up my statement.\n\nAnd for the first time since I was ten or 11 years old, I\u2019m feeling frightened in my own country.\n\nNow, I\u2019m six feet four inches tall and well-capable of looking after myself. But I\u2019m now literally looking over my shoulder.\n\nThat\u2019s why racism has left me feeling lower than a snake\u2019s belly.\n\nNot just because the issue was highlighted again in eastern Europe.\n\nBut because we have our own problems. They\u2019re real. The problem\u2019s growing.\n\nI just hope the hypocrites who condemned what took place in Sofia can see it too.", "description": "The events in Bulgaria are not confined to Eastern Europe - the problem here is getting worse, and it's scary", "authors": ["Stan Collymore", "Image", "Michael Zemanek Bpi Rex", "James Fearn Ppauk", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581321.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
