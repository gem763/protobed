There's plenty of games to choose from, but we've found the best bargains of the lot.\n\nThe sale runs from now until 4am AEDT on November 2, so you'll want to get a move on if you spot a must-have deal.

Of them, I'd really recommend checking out Cube Escape Paradox and its preceding games. They're a bunch of simple Twin Peaks-inspired adventures that tell a thoroughly creepy and fantastic story.\n\nWhich games are you picking up?", "description": "This week is the spookiest of them all, and Steam's celebrating the best way it knows how \u2014 with a delightfully creepy Halloween Sale!
