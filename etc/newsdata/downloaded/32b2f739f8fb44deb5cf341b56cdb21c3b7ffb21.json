The Withdrawal Agreement Bill will be published on Monday and go through its first reading. MPs will then vote on the second reading on Tuesday.\n\nSenior Labour figures at the weekend discussed trying to amend Brexit legislation to push for either a second referendum or a written commitment Britain will negotiate to remain part of the EU customs union.\n\nIf either is successful, the Prime Minister is likely to abandon attempts to pass his Brexit deal through the current Parliament.\n\nOn Sunday, the \"fragile but sincere coalition of people\" backing Mr Johnson's deal appeared to be under threat. There were also suggestions the DUP could back Labour's plans to keep the UK in the customs union.\n\nOne senior DUP source said: \"It will be parliamentary guerilla warfare.\"\n\nA No 10 source said: \"All our focus is on getting royal assent before October 31.\" They warned that if MPs weighed down the deal with amendments, Brexit was \"looking increasingly like no deal\".\n\nWriting in The Daily Telegraph, Secretary of State for Trade Liz Truss heavily criticised Labour's plans to table a customs union amendment to the vote, saying it would \"take us back to square one\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA government source said: \"It's on a knife-edge. Everything plays into this week. It is not just about Europe, it's whether an election will happen this year. The idea is get the Bill through, and push for an election immediately.\"\n\nNovember 28 has been pencilled in as a date, a source said, adding that unless Parliament passed an election by Friday, the next possible date would be in December, \"and no one wants that\".\n\n\"Unless they get everything sorted this week, it probably won't happen until the New Year,\" the source said.\n\nThe warning was sounded as senior DUP figures - who previously propped up the minority Conservative government - indicated the party could unite with Labour to force through an an amendment to the Bill which would compel the Government to pursue a customs union with Brussels. One insider said a customs union could assuage the DUP's concerns over potential barriers erected between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nIn an effort to secure the DUP's support for a customs union, Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said Labour's \"door is open\".\n\nAmid the chaos, Michael Gove stepped up the Government's no-deal planning by holding an emergency meeting at the weekend of the \"XS\" Cabinet office committee. John Bercow, the Speaker, on Monday was set for another clash with the Government when he rules on whether to allow their second attempt at putting through a meaningful vote.\n\n7\n\nThe Telegraph London", "description": "Boris Johnson will launch a renewed attempt to push his Brexit deal through Parliament this week as a rebel alliance of MPs pledged to fight a 'guerilla war' to stop Britain leaving the EU by the end of the month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2226%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_51%2C$y_73/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/923a9e79d2029d987f65928ade90bc33fedcd5ef", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
