Higher temperatures and slower social and economic development would lead to greater risk.\n\nIn west and central Africa, where outbreaks have traditionally clustered, outbreaks would happen more frequently and spread farther, via airlines, to previously unaffected areas, the researchers suggested. Using the current network of airline flights in their model, the study suggests that there is a high risk of Ebola spreading to China, Russia, India, Europe and the United States.\n\nThe first Ebola outbreak was identified in 1976 and there have been 23 outbreaks recognized since . There's still more research to be done on exactly how these outbreaks start, but scientists suspect Old World fruit bats that carry the disease may be at least in part be to blame. They also believe contact between humans, great apes and duikers -- a small brown antelope -- may be connected to these outbreaks.", "description": "The climate crisis is going to raise the risk that Ebola will spread farther and reach areas previously unaffected by the virus, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008143330-ebola-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
