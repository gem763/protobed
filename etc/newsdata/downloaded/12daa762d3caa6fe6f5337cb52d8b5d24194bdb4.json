I told him it\u2019s never gonna work,\u201d Wong wrote.\n\nReeves played an eccentric version of himself in the Netflix rom-com Always Be My Maybe, in which he famously romanced Wong\u2019s character. And while audiences loved that hilarious scene in the movie, Wong\u2019s caption makes it clear their love has sailed.\n\nReeves doesn\u2019t look too heartbroken though, so we\u2019re hoping the two can remain friends. Otherwise, Wong\u2019s true soulmate, Randall Park, will have to punch him (again).\n\nWong has been on the L.A. leg of her Milk & Money comedy tour for the past few weeks, and she\u2019s had quite a few famous faces stop by, including Mahershala Ali, Daniel Dae Kim (her other ex from Always Be My Maybe), and America Ferrera.\n\nNext up for Wong is a role on the highly anticipated Harley Quinn film Birds of Prey, starring Margot Robbie. Reeves, meanwhile, is set to reprise his iconic role in the 2020 film, Bill & Ted Face the Music. We\u2019re happy for them \u2014 it\u2019s always good to stay busy after a breakup.\n\nRelated content:", "description": "Ali Wong reunites with ex-boyfriend Keanu Reeves at standup show", "authors": ["Rachel Yang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aG0GxmWKowCOwrBpadQD2Q--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/6d1f850f08df206480c99f4b454c5061", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
