He plays a cop trying to defuse a violent standoff in the $15 million drama \u201c#FreeRayshawn,\u201d to be viewed in chapters under 10 minutes and only on smartphones.\n\nThe shoot is part of a Hollywood wager that the smallest screen may finally be ready for the big time. \u201c#FreeRayshawn\u201d is one of dozens of serialized short-format programs on the way, as the movie and television industry reaches for an audience of time-killers glued to their mobile devices, with episodes no longer than a typical Uber ride.\n\nAt the edge of the \u201c#FreeRayshawn\u201d set, Antoine Fuqua, the project\u2019s producer, studies a video monitor to see how the scene will look on a phone screen. He has directed movies for the last two decades, including Denzel Washington pictures like \u201cTraining Day,\u201d and says he \u201chad to rejigger my brain\u201d to help break \u201c#FreeRayshawn\u201d into chunks for screens that viewers will hold in their hands.\n\nLaurence Fishburne rehearses a scene during the shooting of \u2018#FreeRayshawn\u2019 in New Orleans, one of dozens of serialized short-format shows on the way. Photo: William Widmer for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cThe world is moving so fast. Hollywood has to work harder to be in front of it,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201c#FreeRayshawn\u201d was financed by the mobile-video company generating the most speculation and investment: Quibi, named for the programs it will dole out in \u201cquick bites\u201d after its planned launch in April. Led by two moguls of movies and technology, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, the company has raised $1 billion in funding. Investors include 10 Hollywood studios, such as Disney , MGM and WarnerMedia. Quibi is using that war chest to fund an onslaught of short-format programming and recruit A-list creators.\n\nMeg Whitman, chief executive officer of Quibi, speaks in Los Angeles in January, while Jeffrey Katzenberg, Quibi\u2019s chairman and founder, listens. Photo: Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg News\n\nThe film and television establishment has a spotty record of creating shows for the internet era\u2019s short attention spans, including a parade of forgettable \u201cwebisodes\u201d and high-concept, low-budget digital series. More recently, mobile apps from Verizon and Vivendi stocked with quick programming both shut down within several years of launch.\n\nBut the people now pouring resources into short-format claim the conditions are finally right. They cite the ubiquity of mobile screens, leaps in streaming-video technology, shifting business models and, most importantly, a generational embrace of content in quick bursts.\n\nOn Snapchat, for example, a growing menu of made-for-mobile shows is intended to spur binge viewing and top-dollar advertising. After first introducing a slate of serialized originals last fall, Snap will announce up to 10 more of these \u201chighly concentrated\u201d shows in September. The company points to \u201cThe Dead Girls Detective Agency\u201d as a bellwether hit, in which deceased characters use lots of phone-centric sleuthing to investigate their own murders. If the five-minute episodes don\u2019t seem quick enough, viewers can always tap the screen to leap forward a bit. Snap says 14 million unique viewers watched the first season.\n\nIf short-form proponents are right, they may be opening the next set of floodgates after streaming television. But impediments to their success are everywhere.\n\nThey\u2019re vying for phone screens already dominated by a different form of \u201cshort\u201d: YouTube vlogs, Instagram stories, looping TikTok clips, and the like. What\u2019s more, people already have a way to watch movies and TV shows on the go in short doses\u2014their Netflix app, for example\u2014and its pause button.\n\nAnother wild card is whether users even want to break from the familiar structures\u2014half-hour sitcom, hourlong drama, two-hour feature film\u2014that have dictated the flow of our on-screen entertainment for decades. The boom in streaming programming and services has only reinforced these traditional content units, with more platforms in the works from WarnerMedia, Apple and others.\n\nInstead of competing for people\u2019s couch time with movies and TV shows, Quibi is offering them an option on-the-go\u2014and betting that big Hollywood talent and budgets will seal the deal.\n\nQuibi\u2019s roster includes directors of the two most recent best-picture Oscar winners: Peter Farrelly, with a comedy about a guy attempting to live in the moment, and Guillermo del Toro, who is producing a zombie show. Steven Spielberg is writing a series tentatively titled \u201cAfter Dark,\u201d a horror serial that can be viewed only after the sun goes down, as determined by the viewer\u2019s location.\n\nIn \u201cAction Scene,\u201d comedy star Kevin Hart gets swept up in a string of stunt sequences. Don Cheadle and Emily Mortimer are set to star in a sci-fi drama about a high-schooler who may not be human. Lorne Michaels and Seth Myers are producing a comedy about a mystery writer ( Paula Pell ) trying to solve small-town murders. Quibi also has remakes from the libraries of its studio partners, including new versions of \u201cThe Fugitive,\u201d \u201cVarsity Blues,\u201d and \u201cHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\u201d\n\nAnother startup, Ficto, expects to launch an app in November with about 100 snack-size shows, including adaptations of young-adult novels. It helps that mobile-video rights to these books are significantly cheaper than film and TV rights, says founder Mike Esola, a former Hollywood literary agent. The company says one of its shows, based on the best-selling romance \u201cCan You Keep a Secret?,\u201d will allow viewers to make choices that send its characters down various paths in a branching story that plays out in episodes of between four and 12 minutes.\n\nOn Netflix, the absence of ads and scheduling blocks encouraged some TV producers to supersize their episodes, and now they\u2019re shrinking them, too. In recent months several Netflix originals rolled out with episodes clocking in around 15 minutes. They include \u201cSpecial,\u201d about a character with cerebral palsy navigating the gay dating scene, and \u201cIt\u2019s Bruno,\u201d about a New Yorker\u2019s neighborhood doings with his puggle.\n\nNetflix says it has no plan to promote shorter shows in their own category. Still, the format did help the streamer this year achieve its highest tally of Emmy nominations so far\u2014both \u201cSpecial\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Bruno\u201d were nominated for \u201coutstanding short-form comedy or drama series,\u201d an Emmy category created in 2016. Other nominees include \u201cState of the Union,\u201d a SundanceTV series written by Nick Hornby ; the 10-minute episodes revolve around one couple\u2019s conversations before marriage-counseling sessions.\n\nChris O'Dowd, left and Rosamund Pike in the SundanceTV series \u2018State of the Union.\u2019 Photo: \u00a9Sundance Film Series/Courtesy Everett C / Everett Collection\n\nThe Disney+ streaming service launching in November will feature multiple capsule shows, including a new vehicle for the Muppets, which will join the long-form movies, series and specials Disney has announced. In September, cable channel FXX introduces \u201cCake,\u201d a late-night showcase for animated and live-action shorts, and intended as an incubator for larger-scale shows.\n\nLong before Quibi, and during his 22-year tenure with DreamWorks studios, Mr. Katzenberg was preaching the value of \u201csnackable\u201d video stories. Just as the dot-com bubble was bursting, he created a company for short films, animations and other video \u201cpops\u201d on the web. Partners included his DreamWorks SKG co-founders (Mr. Spielberg and David Geffen ) and Imagine Entertainment\u2019s Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. But their Pop.com folded before the site even launched.\n\n\u201cIt was a very short-lived short-form content company,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg says. \u201cIn 1999, you could not make a dime monetizing anything on the internet.\u201d\n\nThe crew of \u2018#FreeRayshawn\u2019 works between scenes on the short-form drama made for smartphones. Photo: William Widmer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nQuibi says it has sold more than $100 million in advertising (with $50 million still available) to six companies, including Google and Procter & Gamble, that are exclusive ad partners for Quibi\u2019s first year of operation. The company will also rely on subscriptions, with or without ads, for about $5 or $8 a month, respectively.\n\nThat business model is what will allow Quibi to keep paying for premium-quality shows with budgets much larger than that of typical digital content, Mr. Katzenberg says, drawing a parallel to HBO and its ability to outspend ad-supported TV networks.\n\nSkeptics argue that even awesome-looking shows from name-brand creators won\u2019t carry the clout with mobile audiences that Quibi is expecting. \u201cIt\u2019s not about product. It\u2019s about minutes, the number of ways people can spend the next 15 minutes [on their phones], which is just going up every day,\u201d says Forrester Research media analyst James McQuivey. The growing number of streaming platforms competing for monthly user fees exacerbates the challenge, he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re the fourth or fifth subscription service people pay for every month, you\u2019re as easy to leave as to try.\u201d\n\nA scene being rehearsed on the #FreeRayshawn set in New Orleans. Photo: William Widmer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nEpisodes of Quibi\u2019s shows, from news roundups and docuseries to high-end scripted series will all be between six and 10 minutes long. That length is based on research showing that millennials and Gen-Zers spend time on their phones throughout the day in sessions averaging 6\u00bd minutes at a time.\n\n\u201cThat happens to be consistent with what TV writers are used to writing,\u201d says Ms. Whitman, Quibi\u2019s chief executive and the former head of Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. and eBay Inc., referring to the typical time span between commercial breaks on television.\n\nCliffhangers come in various forms in \u201c#FreeRayshawn,\u201d directed by Seith Mann and produced by Fuqua Films and Sony Pictures Television. An Iraq war veteran played by Stephan James (of the Amazon TV series \u201cHomecoming\u201d and the Oscar-winning film \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d) flees from cops after his attempt to sell a gun goes wrong. He barricades himself at home, inadvertently trapping his wife and son in an armed standoff with police. Rayshawn uses social media to communicate with the public watching his situation unfold. Some episodes end with a spike in the action, or revelations intended to keep viewers in suspense over whom to trust, Rayshawn or Mr. Fishburne\u2019s character.\n\nDirector Seith Mann on the set of \u2018#FreeRayshawn\u2019 Photo: William Widmer for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Katzenberg compares \u201c#FreeRayshawn\u201d to \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d the gritty 1975 Al Pacino hostage film directed by Sidney Lumet. This is one key to his recruitment pitch to Hollywood\u2019s elite: Quibi is backing the kind of mid-budget, character-driven stories that franchise-focused movie studios rarely buy now. \u201cWe\u2019re using a new form of film narrative to return to an era of movie storytelling that was phenomenally successful for 20 years,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg says, reeling off a list of classic films, from \u201cChinatown\u201d to \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby.\u201d\n\nOn the set of \u201c#FreeRayshawn\u201d this summer, however, the title mentioned most often is \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the streaming TV series that in 2013 helped put Netflix on its path to industry behemoth.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Would you watch a film short on your phone? What would it have to include to make you want to hit play? Join the conversation below.\n\nTo Mr. Fishburne, \u201c#FreeRayshawn\u201d looked like an opportunity to get in on the next wave. \u201cThis is written, edited and shot to appeal to the person who watches on a small screen,\u201d says the \u201cMatrix\u201d and \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d star. \u201cI don\u2019t watch things on a small screen\u2014I much prefer a larger screen\u2014but it\u2019s fantastic for my work to be present there.\u201d\n\nQuibi\u2019s other selling point to producers is financial: Each project is licensed to Quibi exclusively for seven years as a short-form series, but after two years, its producers have the right to repackage it and shop it elsewhere. \u201cJeffrey said to me, make this thing and in a couple years, you own it,\u201d says \u201c#FreeRayshawn\u201d executive producer Mr. Fuqua, who got his start directing music videos and commercials in the 1990s, and has recently produced TV and documentaries. \u201cTo own intellectual property that someone else is paying for? That just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nAs he watched another take of the door-slamming scene, Mr. Fuqua asked the director to capture reactions on the actors\u2019 faces. The producer would need such transitional footage later. He plans to eventually re-edit \u201c#FreeRayshawn\u201d and sell it to a different distributor in a more familiar format, as an uninterrupted feature film.\n\nAntoine Fuqua, producer of \u2018#FreeRayshawn,\u2019 plans to eventually sell the drama as a feature film.

The biggest splash comes from \u201cDr. Horrible\u2019s Sing-Along Blog\u201d from director Joss Whedon and starring Neil Patrick Harris. After premiering briefly for free, it is monetized in various ways, with downloads from iTunes and sales of a bonus-filled DVD.\n\nLisa Kudrow in \u2018Web Therapy\u2019 Photo: Everett Collection\n\n2008\n\nIn \u201cWeb Therapy,\u201d with three-minute episodes on a site funded by Lexus, Lisa Kudrow is a self-absorbed counselor to clients played by guest stars like Meryl Streep.

It takes several years for Ms. Rae to translate her style into a half-hour TV series, \u201cInsecure,\u201d which hits HBO in 2016, but signature elements of the web series carry over, including her faux-hardcore rap monologues.\n\n2012\n\nIn a push for more polished original programming, YouTube parcels out $100 million among 100 of its channels, many celebrity-branded. Most fizzle. AwesomenessTV, led by TV producer Brian Robbins and focused on teens, is one of the rare start-ups that flourishes. It is later bought by DreamWorks Animation.\n\n2015\n\nAwesomeness becomes one of many content companies pumping out short-form shows for Go90, a free mobile-video service launched by Verizon as a magnet for ads geared to millennial and Gen-Z viewers. They never really show up, and Go90 shutters in 2018.\n\nKennedy Hermansen in SKAM Austin Photo: Facebook Watch\n\n2015\n\nNorwegian series \u201cSkam\u201d makes waves internationally as an authentic teen drama with a distribution method tailored to its target audience.
