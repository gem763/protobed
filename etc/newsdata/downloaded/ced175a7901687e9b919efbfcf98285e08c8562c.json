I am excited to get started and build teams\u2019 that the whole game can be proud of.\n\n\u201cThere is a tremendous amount of talent coming through, and there is enormous potential for growth. The hard work starts now, and I am confident we can make a positive impact during our winter tours of New Zealand and South Africa.\u201d\n\nThe Spin | Rajasthan Royals\u2019 English academy: a glimpse of cricket\u2019s future?

I believe he is what we need to take our international teams forward.\n\n\u201cHe is somebody we know well, but it is his intimate understanding of our structures and systems and his close relationships with Test captain Joe Root and white-ball captain Eoin Morgan that will help us develop our plans for the next few years. He has performed exceptionally well during his role as an assistant coach and has the ultimate respect of the players\u2019 that have worked with him.\u201d\n\nGiles added: \u201cChris demonstrated in his interview a clear understanding and strategy of how both the red and white ball teams need to evolve. He has some detailed thoughts on what it will take to win the Ashes in Australia and win major ICC white-ball tournaments.\u201d\n\nGiles was always keen to appoint an English candidate if possible, with Silverwood, the former Yorkshire seamer, just the second to hold the position in the past 20 years after spells for Peter Moores from 2007 to 2009 and then 2014 to 2015.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nGiles added: \u201cOver the past couple of years [Silverwood] has been an integral member of developing the teams\u2019 culture and emerging a cohesive relationship across the team\u2019s management group.\n\n\u201cChris cares passionately about how we grow and develop the game through the county network. His relationships with the first-class game, in particular County Coaches and Directors of Cricket, will be invaluable.\n\n\u201cHaving led Essex to the County Championship title in 2017, his legacy is very much in evidence this campaign, which saw Essex win the domestic double of the Specsavers County Championship and the Vitality Blast. Ultimately, his highest quality is that he is a winner and that will be an important part of the job as we look to strive to become the most respected team in the world across all formats.\u201d\n\nSilverwood\u2019s first assignment in full charge is the tour to New Zealand that departs at the end of this month, before further trips to South Africa and Sri Lanka this winter.
