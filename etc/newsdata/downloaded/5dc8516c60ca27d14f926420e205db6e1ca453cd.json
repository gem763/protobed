This week we look at how to use red to decorate .\n\n\n\nRed has a reputation for regality. A color associated with kings and queens, it\u2019s not always top of mind when it comes to home hues. But red is multi-faceted and can be expressed across the spectrum. \u201cRed is a fabulous color to accentuate a room,\u201d said Nicola Fontanella, owner of Argent Design based in Miami and London. \u201cWe use its wide range of shades in our schemes, from apartments to large estates. The color can be bright, warm, fresh and also provocative.\u201d Here, advice from the design pros for a red-hot home.\n\nMore: Perfect Pillows: Finding the Right Cushions to Accessorize Your Space\n\nConsider the Shade\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a strong color, it is important to look at the shade of red you use, whether vibrant or cool. We use this as an accent in our schemes, like jewelry for a gown, to highlight details and features in a large room. Rich Bordeaux velvets, fresh Ferrari red silks and burgundy wallpaper can be found in a number of our elite clients\u2019 houses and yachts across the globe. Unlike mixing wines, we often mix Bordeaux and burgundy to create a rich and luxurious scheme for our clients. Bright red can be fresh and exotic and awakening, whereas darker reds can be more luxurious, rich and sexy.\n\n\u201cWe pair maroon with scarlet and sometimes crimson in our schemes, in addition to other colors within our interiors\u2014both in wallpapers and also cushions and accessories. An entirely red room can be somewhat strong, but paired with tan, navy or warm grays in clubrooms, bedrooms and family areas it can add a great punch of color to liven things up.\u201d\n\nBright red chair accents brighten up a dining room designed by Nicola Fontanella, owner of Argent Design.

Red is sexy. Red is elegant. Red is exciting. Red can also be unsettling at times. Red keeps things interesting because people react to it so differently. When using red, be sure to use it thoughtfully and creatively. I love sneaking it somewhere in my projects because it creates so much depth and is always a fun pop of color.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you are set on painting your room red, I would advise doing it in a room that sees lots of action like a living room, salon or bar area. Red is an extremely stimulating color and is fabulous for areas in your home that are lively and energetic but not for areas of relaxation. One of my favorite things is to use a very high-gloss or lacquered red to add another level of glam to a room. For those who are dying to use red on the bedroom walls, I'd consider limiting it to an accent wall or integrating it into a paint pattern.\n\n\n\n\u201cMixing different shades of red in a room is asking for disaster. However, you can mix red with other warm colors on the palette, like rust, orange, pinks and magenta to balance out and complement it.\n\n\n\n\u201cRed is such a beautiful, timeless statement, but the elegance of red shines brightest when strategically used and not overdone. It also creates a huge impact when you use it on an unexpected piece, such as a light fixture or sculpture. The one thing I would caution against red upholstery is that red dye is extremely unstable and can oftentimes rub off on your clothes, so make sure you get a high-quality fabric or a few bottles of Scotchguard.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nicolette Tsukamoto, president of Studio Akiko design based in Pasadena, California\n\nMore: New Ways to Do Nautical Design\n\nBe Open-Minded\n\n\u201cRed is a powerful, strong and versatile color, which can really lift a space, adding character, warmth and depth to a room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also an incredibly adaptable color as there are so many shades to work with and each one offers a very different aesthetic. For example, a lighter pastel red has a mid-century feel to it, while a bright lipstick red is much bolder and offers a more contemporary look. Deep, dark cherry reds are more traditional and give a more classic country look.\n\nIn a bedroom designed by Richard Angel, co-founder of Angel O'Donnell, a red, textural headboard also functions as a dramatic feature wall. Ola Smit\n\n\u201c\u200bThere is less blue pigment in a lighter red, so it becomes brighter and more contemporary and energizing. A deep, rich red is particularly striking when used with black or really inky green blues.\n\n\u201cPeople are often intimidated by the color red, they think it will be too overpowering or that it will make the space feel small, but it all depends on the tone and how it is used. Deep reds can be exceptionally warming and will intensify within a small space to create a very welcoming environment. A bright red is best used to add a punch of color on a feature wall.\n\n\u201c\u200bIt is certainly possible to mix different shades of red in one space. However, it only really works when these colors are used on different textures. To have different tones of red all on the same material would likely clash, so make sure the colors are used in different ways with a mix of textures throughout the space.\n\n\u201c\u200bHave fun with it; be bold. It's such a striking color, it's worth ensuring that it stands out from the crowd. Red cushions on a green sofa, for instance, can be both contemporary or country depending on the fabrics and pattern.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Richard Angel, co-founder of Angel O\u2019Donnell design studio based in London\n\n\n\nClick to read more news and stories about luxury home design", "description": "", "authors": ["Jennifer Tzeses"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-105724?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
