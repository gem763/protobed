He spoke to reporters not long after Martinez did, and he was in visible pain when he entered the news conference room. The 35-year-old rotated his entire upper body to look at reporters when they asked questions. His wife had to help him dress Sunday morning.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I wake up, I couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cI had to fall out of bed and basically pick myself up with my left arm. I knew at that point I was in a really bad spot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as disappointed as I possibly can be to not be able to pitch tonight,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s Game 5 of the World Series. I\u2019ve pitched through so much crap in my career that would be easy to pitch through at this point. It\u2019s literally impossible to do anything with.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe pain started a few days ago, but Scherzer didn\u2019t think anything of it because he has had \u201clittle neck spasms\u201d before and knew how to get through them. But he came to Nationals Park and got treatment Friday and \u201cit didn\u2019t feel quite right.\u201d Hitting usually loosens up Scherzer, but when he took batting practice that day, it didn\u2019t.\n\nScherzer arrived at the park Saturday with a plan to heal. He received treatment. He spoke with doctors. He eased through the day and found a way to play catch. Then he woke up Sunday morning and \u201cwas completely locked up.\u201d Doctors told him it wasn\u2019t just the muscle spasms but that a nerve in his neck \u201cis all jammed up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThankfully, the doctors said as long as I have no numbness coming down my arms or anything, they don\u2019t think I can do anything serious long-term damage here,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just pinching up the nerve.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe pain is not related to the back injuries that landed him on the injured list twice this summer, Scherzer said. He returned to the active roster in late August and admitted to pitching at less than 100 percent, but just before the playoffs the right-hander asserted he felt back to normal again.\n\n\u201cThe back issues are fine,\u201d Scherzer said Saturday before Game 4. \u201cAll those back issues I have to really address in the offseason.\n\nGeneral Manager Mike Rizzo learned of the ailment via text Sunday morning. He is hopeful Scherzer can recover in time to start a potential Game 7 in Houston. Doctors told Scherzer it could be possible, and they gave him a cortisone shot Sunday morning that would take at least 48 hours to become effective. The shot should alleviate the pain and could allow him to pitch the potential clincher Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a little thing that turned into a big thing that turned into a giant thing,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\nThis news is especially surprising because of Scherzer\u2019s reputation as a bulldog competitor who plays through pain. Earlier this season, the veteran right-hander broke his nose on a bunt attempt during batting practice and threw seven scoreless innings the next night anyway. In July, back trouble landed Scherzer on the injured list and, during the recovery process, Martinez mentioned multiple times the challenge of managing Scherzer\u2019s effort. The ace wanted to rush back and help the team and, despite being less than 100 percent, he pushed, hurt himself further and landed back on the IL. For Scherzer to miss a start of this magnitude signaled to teammates and opponents the immensity of the pain.\n\n\u201cFor Max to miss a game, especially a significant game like this, he\u2019s got to be really hurting,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll see signs of him starting to get better, and then we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAstros starter Justin Verlander, who played with Scherzer in Detroit, echoed that sentiment: \u201cIt\u2019s got to be pretty bad,\u201d Verlander said.\n\nAstros Manager A.J. Hinch said he learned about Scherzer\u2019s scratch when third baseman Alex Bregman walked into his office, showed him an alert on his phone and asked if it was true. Martinez said he dispatched bench coach Chip Hale to tell the Astros a half-hour before he announced the decision.\n\nHale and Houston bench coach Joe Espada had been in touch all afternoon regarding the Nationals\u2019 delay in sharing their lineup, Hinch said. Hinch assumed the delay derived from the status of ailing catcher Kurt Suzuki, who exited Game 3 with an injury. \u201cI have no problem with how they informed us,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cThey were top-end across the board. If I put myself in their shoes, I would wait until the absolute last minute as well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGame 6 starter Stephen Strasburg, the Nationals\u2019 other ace, said teammates were aware Scherzer was physically compromised before Sunday. \u201cGuys were talking in the clubhouse,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cEverybody is dealing with the effects of a long season. You really try to focus on things you can control.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s kind of done a little bit of everything this year,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a great competitor. He\u2019s such a great athlete. I trust his ability to prepare.\u201d\n\nStrasburg said the Nationals never considered starting him on short rest rather than having him start Game 6 as scheduled. Martinez said Ross could throw between 75 and 80 pitches. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let him go as much as he can,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nAD\n\nScherzer is the most decorated and highest-paid ace in Nationals history. He signed a seven-year, $210 million before the 2015 season and became one of the best free agent signings ever. He won two Cy Young Awards, threw two no-hitters and recorded one 20-strikeout game. He has been an all-star every season since joining Washington, and to end the first half of this season he turned in perhaps the best nine-start stretch of his career. The 35-year-old posted an 0.84 ERA and 94 strikeouts against nine walks across 64 innings.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the Nationals dropped Game 4, players in the clubhouse expressed confidence they could bounce back in Game 5 because of Scherzer. They now don\u2019t have him, but closer Sean Doolittle told MLB Network on the field before the game no one is panicking. He cited the poor start to this season, the deficit in the wild-card game and the difficult comeback against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Division Series.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to bet on ourselves,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve been through this season \u2026 we\u2019re totally comfortable in this situation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRoss, 26, went 4-4 this season with a 5.48 ERA in 27 appearances, nine of which came as a starter. Friday night in Game 3, Ross fired two scoreless innings of relief against the Astros, allowing one hit. Ross relies on two pitches, a sinker and slider, and will almost exclusively use his curveball, change-up and four-seam fastball against left-handed hitters. The Astros shifted their lineup from the first two games at Nationals Park and started Yordan Alvarez despite his limited mobility in left field. Ross has struggled against left-handed hitters overall this season and especially against sluggers such as Alvarez.\n\nAD\n\nMartinez, for his part, spoke to his players before he announced the news and explained the situation. The manager found all of his players upbeat, as Doolittle later reflected. Scherzer drove home the point during his news conference.\n\n\u201cWatching Joe Ross pitch the other night, he looked extremely polished in what he was able to do,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cIn our clubhouse, we just believe the next guy up can always get the job done.\u201d\n\nMax Scherzer will not start today. Spasms in his right trapezius. Woke up much worse. Joe Ross will start. Hard to imagine how bad it must have been for Max to say he couldn\u2019t go today. Unthinkable, really. \u2014 Chelsea Janes (@chelsea_janes) October 27, 2019\n\nRead more:", "description": "Nationals right-hander has a muscle strain near his right trapezius / neck area and will not make his scheduled start in tonight's pivotal Game 5 against the Astros.
