(AP) - Washington Redskins fans finally got their wish and saw first-round draft pick Dwayne Haskins Jr. take over as quarterback.\n\nLike the Redskins\u2019 season, the result was disappointing.\n\nWashington is 0-4 after losing to the New York Giants 24-3. Coach Jay Gruden\u2019s job is in jeopardy and Haskins failed to provide a spark, finishing 9 of 17 for 107 yards and three interceptions, including one Jabrill Peppers returned 32 yards for a touchdown.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t execute the way I wanted to, but the good thing about it is that it hurts, and there (are) going to be brighter days tomorrow,\u201d said Haskins, the Ohio State product who was the No. 15 overall pick in the draft.\n\nThe Redskins need that. This is their worst since going 0-5 in 2001.\n\nSearching for a spark with the Redskins trailing 14-0 midway through the second quarter, Gruden benched Case Keenum and brought on Haskins to run the show after Quinton Dunbar\u2019s second interception of the quarter gave Washington the ball at the New York 37.\n\nFor a couple of minutes, the decision looked great. The Redskins got a quick first down, Haskins completed a 6-yard pass to Trey Quinn for another first down, and he later scrambled 14 yards for a first-and-goal at the 1.\n\nThat\u2019s was it. A first-down incompletion, a loss of 2 yards on a run and a third-down incompletion forced Washington to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Dustin Hopkins.\n\nHaskins and the Redskins didn\u2019t score again, with three drives ending in interceptions, the last two by Janoris Jenkins.\n\n\u201cI had a whole bunch of emotions in my head,\u201d Haskins said of when offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell told him he was going in. \u201d just wanted to win the game and we didn\u2019t. \u2026 On to next week.\u201d\n\nHaskins does not know who will start next week. It is uncertain whether Gruden will be the coach when Washington plays host to the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cIf I feel like he gives us the best chance to win against New England, I\u2019ll put him in,\u201d Gruden said of Haskins. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is at every position with everybody. You\u2019re just not handed the keys because of where you\u2019re drafted, you\u2019ve got to earn the right. I think he will continue to get better, and better, and better.\u201d\n\nVeteran running back Adrian Peterson felt Haskins provided a spark.\n\n\u201cOf course, he had interceptions, but that\u2019s things he can tweak,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWhen you look at those plays, those shots he took downfield, the first one was a good defensive play. Of course, things could have been better. The tight end could have not stumbled, and Haskins could have thrown it a little better, but it was a hell of a play by Jenkins. I think he\u2019ll take a better look at them and come back better next week for sure.\u201d\n\nKeenum, who battled a foot injury, was 6 of 11 for 37 yards with an interception when he was lifted. The pick on a deflection led to New York\u2019s first touchdown.\n\nKeenum said he was surprised being lifted and agreed he was frustrated.\n\n\u201cI think we are all frustrated in this locker room; we all have to play better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough league. Every week. Everybody is really good and you can\u2019t do what we did on third down, have penalties, turn the ball over and expect to win. It just is what it is.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s 176 offensive yards were the fewest allowed by the Giants since the Minnesota Vikings gained 164 yards on Dec. 13, 2010. The Redskins hurt themselves with 12 penalties for 58 yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington Redskins fans finally got their wish and saw first-round draft pick Dwayne Haskins Jr. take over as quarterback.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Canavan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/redskins_giants_football_10169_c0-100-2394-1495_s1770x1032.jpg?4cd521e8a24977764bec77afb0be858751b1a9d9", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
