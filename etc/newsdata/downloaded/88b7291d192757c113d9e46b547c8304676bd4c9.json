We always know we can compete against these guys, and to do it in the fashion that we did today was nice.\u201d\n\nThe Astros were coming off a 21-1 win over Seattle on Sunday and a 15-0 thrashing of Oakland on Monday in which they hit seven homers.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the A\u2019s tied a franchise record with 25 hits and built a 7-0 lead in the first inning without an extra-base knock. They still ended up tying a season high with six homers after not hitting any in their previous two games. Their 25 hits were the most they\u2019d hit since 1969.\n\nKhris Davis hit Oakland\u2019s first long ball in the second inning. Olson went deep in the third and added another homer in a six-run fourth that also featured blasts by Sean Murphy and Marcus Semien to push the lead to 17-2. The A\u2019s set a franchise record for runs scored through the first four innings.\n\nMurphy homered again in the fifth, and Semien added an RBI double.\n\n\u201cThey executed pretty flawlessly, and they crushed the ball later in the game,\u201d Houston manager AJ Hinch said.\n\nAll nine Oakland starters had at least two hits, and six players finished with three each. Olson and Murphy had three hits and four RBIs apiece and Davis and Semien drove in three runs each.\n\nOlson has a career-high 31 homers this season, joining Mark McGwire (eight times) and Jason Giambi (twice) as the only Oakland third basemen to top 30.\n\nThe Astros got two homers each from George Springer and Martin Maldonado to give them a franchise-record 252 this season as their five-game winning streak ended.\n\nHouston became the first team in the majors to score 20 or more runs in a game and allow 20 or more runs in a different game in a three-game span since Aug. 6-7, 1894, when the Brooklyn Bridegrooms did it, according to STATS.\n\nThe Astros are the third MLB team to have three straight games decided by 14 or more runs and the first since the 1800s when in 1876 the Chicago White Stockings had a streak of four such games and the Cleveland Spiders had three in a row in 1893.\n\nTanner Roark (10-8) yielded eight hits and five runs in 5 2/3 innings for his third straight win.\n\nAfter Miley (13-5) had allowed five runs without getting an out in his last start against Seattle, Hinch was asked before the game what he\u2019d like to see from his left-hander this time.\n\n\u201cI want him to get an out,\u201d Hinch joked.\n\nHinch certainly wasn\u2019t laughing when one out was all Miley managed before he was pulled with the Athletics leading 6-0. Miley allowed seven singles and walked one before he was replaced by Cy Sneed. He was charged with seven earned runs, which tied a season worst. The eight hits Oakland piled up in the first inning tied a season high.\n\n\u201cA lot of cutters in and you can either beat it on the ground or you can try to stay inside it and hit it the other way,\u201d Melvin said of his team\u2019s approach against Miley. \u201cJust not trying to do too much and the hole\u2019s open at second and just trying to pass the baton on to the next guy.\u201d\n\nMiley took his first loss since June 17. In his previous tough start, Houston rallied to win in 13 innings.\n\nHe was at a loss as to why things have gone so awry after he pitched so well all season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I\u2019m not thinking, \u2018What the hell is going on,\u2019\u201d Miley said. \u201c(But) it\u2019s just baseball, it\u2019s a humbling game, I\u2019ve just got to get back to work and try to get after it.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAstros: SS Carlos Correa (sore lower back) is progressing, and if his next two days of rehabilitation go well, he will join Triple-A Round Rock for a rehabilitation game on Friday.\n\nMARKING HIS SPOT\n\nA day after Yordan Alvarez became the first Astro to hit a home run to the third deck at Minute Maid Park the Astros marked where it landed by painting the seat in the first row of section 337 orange.\n\nIt was the second of two homers he hit on Monday night to pass Carlos Correa for most home runs by a rookie in franchise history with 24.\n\nODDS AND ENDS\n\nDavis hit his 20th homer on Tuesday to become the first Athletic with four straight 20-homer seasons since Eric Chavez had seven in a row from 2000-06. \u2026 Semien scored two runs to give him 107 this season, the most for the A\u2019s since Miguel Tejada\u2019s 108 in 2002. \u2026 It was the third multi-homer game of Maldonado\u2019s career and his first since 2017.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOakland LHP Brett Anderson (11-9, 4.19 ERA) will pitch Wednesday against Houston\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Urquidy (1-1, 5.33). Anderson allowed eight hits and five runs in five innings of a 10-6 win over the Angels in his last start but did not factor in the decision.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Oakland Athletics could think of no better way to erase the memory of a blowout loss to the Houston Astros than to turn things around on the AL West leaders on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/athletics_astros_baseball_48991_c1-0-5307-3094_s1770x1032.jpg?2c6c26398c08eb89a8dbf08069bdb943f4662c2f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
