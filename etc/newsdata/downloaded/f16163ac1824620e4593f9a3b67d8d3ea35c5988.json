Nine out of every 10 salaried workers in a recent straw poll said they spend money to relieve stress.\n\nIn the poll of 716 salaried workers by employment portal Job Korea last year, 96.1 percent of the respondents said they spent money on retail therapy. They spent W149,000 on average a month to make themselves feel better, though the amount varied depending on whether they were married or single (US$1=W1,063). Singles spent an average of W161,000 a month but married workers W109,000.\n\n", "description": "Does Retail Therapy Work?", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2018/04/06/2018040601060_0.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-06"}
