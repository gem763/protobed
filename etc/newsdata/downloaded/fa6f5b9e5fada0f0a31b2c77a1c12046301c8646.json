Risks are now growing for APPL as Senator Ted Cruz leads criticism over Cook\u2019s decision to delete an app in Hong Kong, and backlash grows over the CEO\u2019s new role as a chairman at Tsinghua University.\n\nTim Cook Has Apple Stock Surging With Diplomatic Approach To China\n\nMany investors were worried how Apple\u2019s stock would perform in the Trump era, given it\u2019s exposure to China. Closing at a record $240.51 on Monday, things are looking rosy for APPL as the company has been on the receiving end of several analyst upgrades thanks to the success of its new iPhone 11. Behind the scenes CEO Tim Cook has been providing essential air support to his troops, as the Apple boss has ensured that he has kept the tech giant in Xi Jinping\u2019s good books.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Cramer and Brown Love Apple\u2019s Trade War Approach\n\nCNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer has been singing Cook\u2019s praises on his show, claiming that the CEO has been on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of Trump\u2019s trade war. For Cramer, this is a definite factor that has helped Apple\u2019s stock flourish despite extremely testing times for global trade.\n\nIn addition to Cramer\u2019s positive take on Apple\u2019s current approach to China relations, another CNBC analyst was singing the incumbent CEO\u2019s praises. Josh Brown, waxed lyrical about how much better off Apple is for having Tim Cook in charge amidst the trade war than if Steve Jobs was running things, stating,\n\n\u201cCould you picture, in a million years, Steve Jobs threading the needle in the way Time Cook has? Cook has to live with the reality that China is a lifeline for his business while simultaneously convincing \u2018mad dog\u2019 Trump that he is going to build things here. He\u2019s done it incredibly well.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz Leads Criticism Against Apple\u2019s Hong Kong Decision\n\nApple\u2019s approach to keeping China happy has not pleased everyone. Cook\u2019s decision to kowtow to Chinese pressure to delete a mapping in Hong Kong has faced criticism from supporters of protesters in the city-state. Senator Ted Cruz tweeted apparently contacted Apple to protest this decision.\n\nIn addition to this controversial move, the Apple boss is now facing a firestorm of criticism for taking a role at Tsinghua University as Chair of an advisory committee for its management school. While investors in APPL have cheered such decisions, some are not so sure. His support of China during the crackdown in Hong Kong is arguably violating the pro-immigrant progressive agenda that Cook has championed against the Trump administration.\n\nMuch like Elon Musk\u2019s successful tariff dodge earlier in the year for Tesla, successful diplomacy is paying dividends for Apple stock. The question remains if APPL can keep pressing higher even if domestic backlash in the U.S. continues to grow.", "description": "Apple stock is at record highs partially thanks to Tim Cook's approach to China, but criticism is growing lead by Senator Ted Cruz.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tim-Cook-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
