In her latest book Good Morning, Monster, she focuses on five patients who overcame their personal trauma, a process Gildiner defines as being heroic.\n\nGildiner spoke with Shelagh Rogers about writing Good Morning, Monster.\n\nLasting mark\n\n\"When I left psychology I was burned out. I'd done it for 25 years and I'd heard everyone's story and so much trauma. I decided to tell my own story.\n\nThese five people that I write about always came back to me \u2014 out of the hundreds of people that I had seen. - Catherine Gildiner\n\n\"I waited almost 20 years before I felt that I could write about my practice. These five people that I write about always came back to me \u2014 out of the hundreds of people that I had seen.\"\n\nIntergenerational trauma\n\n\"I would encounter clients who had inherited trauma all the time.

I wanted to protect their identities. To maintain patient confidentiality, I changed details \u2014 things like a patient's occupation, hair colour, what they looked like \u2014 and sometimes I brought in other cases so that it wouldn't all be about that one person.\n\nTo maintain patient confidentiality, I changed details \u2014 things like a patient's occupation, hair colour, what they looked like \u2014 and sometimes I brought in other cases so that it wouldn't all be about that one person. - Catherine Gildiner\n\n\"They became a composite of different people, so that it wouldn't be one person's life so somebody could possibly recognize.
