Among them was the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which subjects the city\u2019s special U.S. trading status to annual reviews and provides for sanctions against officials deemed responsible for undermining its \u201cfundamental freedoms and autonomy.\u201d\n\nThe threat roiled markets during Asian trading, at one point wiping out a 0.8% rally in the regional equity benchmark. Futures on the S&P 500 Index were still down 0.2% as of 8:06 a.m. in London after falling twice that much in Asia. The yuan was also 0.2% lower against the dollar offshore.\n\nWhile the legislation must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law, it already has strong bipartisan support in the Republican-run upper chamber. The Hong Kong measures were passed by the Democrat-controlled House by unanimous voice votes Tuesday.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
