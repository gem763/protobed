He said in a panel discussion at the conference that he was eager for Brazil to accept the invitation.\n\nIf it joined, Brazil could become the third-biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Brazil\u2019s burgeoning production is complicating OPEC\u2019s effort to prop up crude prices in the face of booming supply from U.S. shale fields and weakening global demand.\n\nBrazil\u2019s oil reserves are bigger than those of several OPEC members, Bolsonaro said. Brazil and OPEC could form \u201ca great partnership\u201d helping each other to stabilize global fossil fuel prices.\n\nBrazil produced 2.71 million barrels a day 2018, according to the International Energy Agency, which forecasts the country\u2019s average output to reach 2.9 million this year and 3.22 million in 2020. Brazilian production in August surged by 220,000 barrels a day to a record 3.1 million, the IEA said in its most recent report.", "description": "Saudi Arabia Asks Brazil to Join OPEC Oil Group, Bolsonaro Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic13a4d4d30e8627037e6ec3d2b5d28ec1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
