To date, the deal they've been promised has not come.\"\n\nLong dispute\n\nThe US and China have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods over the past 15 months, casting a pall over the global economy.\n\nThe US wants better protection for US intellectual property, and an end to both cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms.\n\nIt also wants China to reduce industrial subsidies and improve access to Chinese markets for US companies.\n\nThis week's talks were the first high-level negotiations in more than two months. They kicked off amid a backdrop of renewed tensions, as the US blacklisted 28 Chinese entities over human rights concerns.\n\nUS business groups, which have largely opposed the tariffs, said they hoped the breakthrough would set the stage for a bigger deal that would remove the import tax hikes already imposed.\n\nMr Trump said the range of issues under discussion warranted breaking up the negotiations into parts.\n\n\"It's going to be such a big deal that doing it in sections and phases I think is really better,\" he said.", "description": "US President Donald Trump hails a \"phase one deal\" and suspends a planned tariff hike.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F564/production/_109202826_gettyimages-1175349481.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
