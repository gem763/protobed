High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has previously criticised Croatia\u2019s treatment of asylum seekers but its statement on the Afghan teenager was unusually strong.\n\nIt said the Croatian police late last month had inflicted \u201cphysical and psychological torture\u201d on him - including beatings and electrocution - that resulted in his suffering fractured ribs and internal bleeding.\n\n\u201cThe Commissariat... expresses concern and outrage over such practices, and warns... the international community about the excessive use of violence by the Croatian border police and blatant violations of human rights,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe teenager, who spoke to Reuters at a Serbian refugee camp where he is now staying with his 15 comrades, identified himself as Sharukhan. He declined to give his full name for fear of being beaten again if he tried to enter Croatia once more.\n\nSharukhan said the Croatian police had also smashed his cell phone and confiscated 600 euros, though they let him keep his Serbian dinars.\n\nOther members of Sharukhan\u2019s group showed bandaged limbs which they said were also caused by Croatian police brutality.\n\n\u201cUNSUPPORTED ALLEGATIONS\u201d\n\nAsked about the accusations, Croatia\u2019s Interior Ministry said it was not aware of this specific case.\n\n\u201cWe consider this to be another in a series of unfounded and substantially unsupported allegations against the Croatian police due to its persistence and determination in protecting the state border and the external border of the European Union,\u201d the ministry said in a statement on its website this week.\n\n\u201cThe allegations about the torture of migrants are absolutely incomprehensible and have no real basis.\u201d\n\nSo far this year Croatian police have prevented 9,487 attempts at illegal border crossings and arrested 600 smugglers, some from Serbia, it added.\n\nIn 2015, hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants passed through the so-called \u2018Balkan route\u2019 on their way to the West but that flow has dwindled to a small trickle since border controls were tightened across the region in 2016.\n\nRados Djurovic, executive director of the Belgrade-based Asylum Protection Centre watchdog, said police violence against illegal migrants in the region was widespread.\n\n\u201cThese practices are taking more dramatic and inhumane shapes, where in addition to beatings, people are being ... degraded and treated as non-humans, and of course are illegally pushed back into Serbia,\u201d Djurovic said.\n\n($1 = 0.8973 euros)", "description": "Serbia's refugee agency has accused Croatian border police of torturing a 16-year-old Afghan refugee and of denying him and 15 other migrants travelling with him their right to claim asylum in the European Union.", "authors": ["Aleksandar Vasovic", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
