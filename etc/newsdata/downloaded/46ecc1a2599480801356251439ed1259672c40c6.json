(Photo: Karen Krogh)\n\nA young adult author was disinvited from a literature festival after the hosting library objected to her lesbian-themed erotica.\n\nJulia Watts of Knoxville, Tenn. has written 18 books about kids in Appalachia, with genres ranging from historical, paranormal, and teen romance. Watts was recently invited to be a panel speaker at the \"LitUp Festival: Arts and Innovation for the Next Generation,\" held at the Knox County Public Library on October 13. In addition to panel speakers, the festival will have a literary scavenger hunt, an escape room, and career advice.\n\nThe 49-year-old had planned to speak about her 2018 book Quiver, centering on the cultural differences between two female friends, one of whom identities as gender non-binary and the other as evangelical Christian.\n\nBut last week, Watts got a phone call from a local bookseller who she says, was the messenger: The library was rescinding its invitation due to lesbian erotica anthologies that Watts contributed to and co-edited more than a decade ago.\n\nThe questionable anthologies are Once Upon a Dyke (2004), Stake Through the Heart (2007), and Tall in the Saddle (2007). \u201cIt was like traveling back in time,\u201d Watts tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThese are very mild \u2014 more lesbian romance with a bit of sexuality.\u201d\n\nThe author points to other writers who have alternated between young and adult content such as Judy Blume, Shel Silverstein, and Roald Dahl, adding that she wouldn\u2019t have discussed her mature subject at the festival.\n\nWatts says she was blindsided by the library\u2019s decision. \u201cNo one spoke to me directly,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cIt felt very strange to be shut out out like that. You would have thought someone researched my work before inviting me.\u201d\n\nThe author has visited the library regularly for 20 years, ever since she moved to Knoxville from Kentucky. \u201cI probably wrote those same essays in the library,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nMary Pom Claiborne, who works in communications for the library tells Yahoo Lifestyle in a statement, \"....We looked for authors representing diverse genres in teen literature including LGBTQ+ authors. Julia Watts was invited to present. It later came to our attention that some of her work is marketed as erotica and does not differentiate between her teen and adult work. Based on that alone, the Library decided to change course. We have reached out to Ms. Watts to offer our sincere apology, and deeply regret this situation. We remain committed to presenting authors who represent different genres of teen literature for this event.\u201d\n\nWatts says the library has apologized in a voicemail and an email. However, she\u2019s no longer angry\u2014 and has made new plans for October 13.\n\nAs Watts tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cI\u2019ve been asked by the University of Tennessee to speak on a literary panel about censorship.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Author Julia Watts wrote the erotica more than a decade ago.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J2CQ09SfNqNAZ05h3wtfyA--~B/aD01NTg7dz00NDI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/50616670-d1bf-11e9-bff9-5a605465d55c", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
