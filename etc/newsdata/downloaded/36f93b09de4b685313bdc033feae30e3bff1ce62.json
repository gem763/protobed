DNA testing is still being conducted to confirm identities of 7 of the 34 victims recovered.#conception \u2014 SB Sheriff's Office (@sbsheriff) September 11, 2019\n\nThe Coast Guard suggested that mariners limit \u201cthe unsupervised charging of lithium-ion batteries and extensive use of power strips and extension cords.\u201d\n\nDespite the new recommendations, officials have not revealed whether they know the exact cause of the fire. The MBI\u2019s investigation may take a year or more to complete.\n\nThe Conception, a 75-foot vessel, was on a three-day, live-aboard diving tour of islands in Southern California over the Labor Day weekend when it caught fire in the early hours of Monday morning.\n\nThe captain and four of the boat\u2019s crew members, who were above deck at the time of the incident, told investigators that they tried multiple times to save the people who were sleeping in the bunkroom below, but said the fire in the galley was impassable, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThey eventually jumped ship and sought help from a nearby fishing boat.\n\nThe Coast Guard called off the search and rescue more than 24 hours after the fire broke out when it was clear that none of the 34 people trapped aboard, including one crew member, had survived.\n\n\u201cThe Coast Guard is deeply saddened by the tragedy that occurred near Santa Cruz Island,\u201d Capt. Jason Neubauer, chair of the Marine Board of Investigation, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cOur hearts go out to the victims, as well as their families and friends. The Coast Guard will conduct a thorough and detailed investigation to determine potential causal factors associated with this tragedy.\u201d", "description": "The Coast Guard also announced Wednesday that it had launched its highest-level marine casualty investigation into the fire, which left 34 people dead.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d79a4153b0000c49fd11350.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
