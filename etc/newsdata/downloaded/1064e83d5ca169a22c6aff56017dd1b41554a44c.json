Security Council resolutions.\n\nNorth Korea rejects U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban Pyongyang from using ballistic missile technology, saying they are an infringement of its right to self-defense.\n\nTalks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have been stalled since a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February broke down in disagreement over nuclear disarmament.", "description": "North Korea said on Thursday it had successfully test-fired a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) from sea to contain external threats and bolster self-defence, ahead of fresh nuclear talks with the United States.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105914372-1557922677185rtx6udpf.jpg?v=1557922731"}
