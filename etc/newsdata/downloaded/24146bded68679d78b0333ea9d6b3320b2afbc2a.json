It\u2019s me, Claire. I\u2019m the food editor here at Lifehacker, and as we\u2019re taking a look at how the Lifehacker staff works, I thought I\u2019d show you how I eat. In order to maintain the conversational flow of How I Eat, I had my boyfriend conduct the interview. Below you will find answers to all sorts of interesting questions such as \u201cHow much Diet Coke do you drink?,\u201d \u201cIs a corndog a breakfast food?,\u201d and \u201cWhat is \u2018snack salt\u2019?\u201d Enjoy.\n\nCurrent gig: Food editor at Lifehacker\n\nWhat do you eat for breakfast?\n\nMost work days I don\u2019t eat breakfast. When I wake up I\u2019m too nervous to eat breakfast, and I usually start working right away. How I structure my day is I write my first article of at around 7:30 a.m. because it has to go up by 9, which is noon on the East Coast. So I roll out of bed, do that, and then usually write my second article. Sometimes that requires cooking something, but it\u2019s usually not breakfast food. If I\u2019m lucky it\u2019s eggs, because then I can eat eggs at around 10:00 in the morning. But sometimes it\u2019s not eggs, it\u2019s something like a pork chop\u2014which is also fine\u2014but sometimes it\u2019s a cheese dip, or something that I don\u2019t want first thing in the morning. So I\u2019ll take a taste of it. But the most successful breakfast routine I ever had was buying a big thing of cottage cheese and eating cottage cheese with halved cherry tomatoes in it.\n\nFor breakfast?\n\nFor breakfast, yeah, because that takes me no time. Or I\u2019ll just eat three tablespoons of cottage cheese out of the container while standing in front of the fridge in between articles.\n\nSo you eat breakfast just to get energy for the day?\n\nWell, that\u2019s only during the week. On the weekend it\u2019s different. On Friday, if you\u2019re here, sometimes you\u2019ll get me a bagel or I\u2019ll go get us both bagels after publishing my first article, before I have a cocktail for 3-Ingredient Happy Hour; it is kind of important to actually get something in my stomach for that. But on the weekends, what do we usually eat? Eggs, I guess.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite way to cook eggs?\n\nI really like that olive oil fried egg that I was doing.\n\nSteak and olive oil-fried eggs (made for work but eaten for pleasure). (Photo: Claire Lower)\n\nOh yeah, those are good.\n\nIt gets real crispy on the edges and the yolk is still super runny. There\u2019s something about that cooking method. I think it\u2019s because I put a lot of oil in the pan, and the oil comes up just enough to completely cover the white\u2014like submerge the white. The white gets completely cooked through, but the yolk kind of pokes up out of the oil so it stays runny. Poaching is fine, but I really like a super slow scramble. So on Sundays sometimes, when you go to do chores or whatever at your place\u2014It\u2019ll take me 45 minutes to scramble these eggs. It\u2019s such a low heat and they taste like they have cheese in them but there\u2019s no cheese in them. But really I only make those once every two months because it takes so long and I\u2019m not very patient. A quicker way to get that result is to add cornstarch to the eggs, and you get a similar creamy texture.\n\nSo you don\u2019t drink coffee every day?\n\nNot every morning. Sometimes I have coffee, but recently I haven\u2019t been drinking coffee because I don\u2019t think I actually like coffee that much. I like a dark roast. I know this town is really big on the bright, citrusy, fruity roasts. And I know this makes me a heathen, but I don\u2019t like those and I wish that we could go back to some darker roasts. .I guess I like espresso the most. I\u2019ll get an iced Americano, or if I do make coffee at home, I put an espresso roast in my regular coffee pot.\n\nDo you usually eat lunch?\n\nNo. I eat two meals a day. I guess we could call the first one \u201cbrunch,\u201d but it\u2019s not brunch food. But if I have eaten something breakfasty I\u2019ll usually skip eating lunch, or I\u2019ll just eat a couple more spoonfuls of cottage cheese. Mosey on over to the fridge and shove those in my mouth and keep working. But if I haven\u2019t eaten and I\u2019m really hungry, and I happen to go the grocery store that day I will get grocery store sushi. That\u2019s easy and it doesn\u2019t create any dirty dishes for me to clean.\n\nIf you think about it, a corn dog is a breakfast food.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad\u2014I was on a real big cottage cheese kick for about two months, and then one day I just got tired of it. And that happens a lot. I just get tired of things. It\u2019s really hard to establish any sort of routine because the idea of eating the same thing two days in a row depresses me, for some reason. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because my mum was a big batch person and I got tired of big batches. She would just make a big batch of stew, or gumbo\u2014and gumbo is actually the only thing that I was happy to eat multiple days in a row because I love it\u2014I should make gumbo. But yeah, I wouldn\u2019t call it \u201clunch.\u201d I usually eat something between 11 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. so we could call that \u201clunch,\u201d I guess. Oh, I was eating turkey corn dogs for breakfast this week. If you think about it, a corn dog is a breakfast food.\n\nCan you explain?\n\nYeah. You have a sausage and then you have kind of a pancake batter around it. It\u2019s basically pancakes and sausage on a stick. I think it counts as breakfast, and the Trader Joe\u2019s turkey corn dogs are actually pretty good, and not that bad for you. I mean, they\u2019re corndogs. I actually don\u2019t like to think of food as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d because then I\u2019ll go crazy. But I think I might get more frozen corn dogs.\n\nA normal breakfast (Photo: Claire Lower)\n\nFor breakfast? With poached eggs?\n\nNo, no! The poached eggs are the weekend breakfast. Corn dogs are a weekday breakfast. How I prepare them is I put them in the microwave and par-cook them for about a minute. But if you just microwave them, they\u2019re too soft, so I pop them in the toaster oven after that.\n\nI should get more corn dogs. I should probably get more cottage cheese too. It keeps me from getting hangry because I can shovel it in my mouth. But what I\u2019m really excited about tomorrow\u2014what I\u2019m going to make I think, for my Sunday brunch\u2014I got bologna and American cheese, so I can start making bologna bowls again. Do you remember the bologna bowls?\n\nOh yeah. I was going to ask you what your favourite cold cut is.\n\nI do love bologna a lot, and not ironically. I think it\u2019s really good. I mean mortadella is basically bologna\u2014it\u2019s fancier bougie bologna, with more fat in it\u2014sometimes pistachios\u2014but bologna is good, and I get infuriated when I can\u2019t buy it at New Seasons because they think they\u2019re too good for bologna. I really miss Bryan bologna, which is the brand that I would eat in Mississippi. We had a family friend who drove a truck for the Bryan company. I like their bacon and I like their bologna a lot. I like the bologna that has the red wax around it that you have to peel off. What other cold cuts? I really like ham.\n\nThe last time I had a Costco membership was when I was married, and our first big fight was about me buying prosciutto, which he called \u201coverpriced ham.\u201d\n\nWhat kind?\n\nWell, I love prosciutto, if we want to get fancy about it. I\u2019ll just eat slices of it with nothing. When I had a Costco membership I would get two giant things of it, and I would just eat eight or more slices in a row by themselves. The last time I had a Costco membership was when I was married, and my first big fight with my ex was about me buying prosciutto, which he called \u201coverpriced ham.\u201d\n\nIs prosciutto a cold cut?\n\nIt\u2019s a fancy cold cut. But yeah, I don\u2019t like turkey really, but I do really like a honey ham or a Virginia ham. But as you know, we like it thinly sliced, almost shaved. So you can pile it up high. I would say ham, prosciutto, and bologna are my favourites. If I could only pick one it would be prosciutto. But what do I eat most often? Bologna. I eat bologna the most out of all of them. I think it has the most applications too, because it\u2019s a good lunch sandwich. If you fry it it\u2019s a good breakfast, and you can also make the bologna bowls so then it\u2019s a vehicle for eggs. It gives us so many gifts, bologna, and I think it\u2019s really underappreciated.\n\nWhat do you put on your bologna sandwich?\n\nTake two slices of white bread, a thinnish layer of mayonnaise, but you want it to cover the bread edge to edge. Mayonnaise on both sides, mustard on one side. The baloney goes on the mustard side, then the American cheese. Then you sandwich it all together. My grandmother taught me that mayonnaise on both breads is important.\n\nWhat do you like to cook for yourself?\n\nA lot of days I won\u2019t feel like cooking anymore by the end of the day, so I\u2019ll cook popcorn, but that doesn\u2019t really count. But if I really want to cook a meal for myself, I\u2019ll do a ribeye and a baked potato and a wedge salad, and I\u2019ll just make a little steakhouse dinner for myself. I\u2019ll even do a gin martini with an olive. Sometimes I\u2019ll actually cook the bacon myself because then I can use the bacon grease to coat the baked potato. But recently I\u2019ve been buying prepared bacon bits because I really like adding bacon bits to everything.\n\nMy favourite pork loin (Photo: Claire Lower)\n\nWhat else do I cook? I like roasting chickens a lot, and doing the labneh chicken where I marinade the whole thing in labneh. Because then we can have that one night\u2014with some duck fat roasted potatoes and maybe a vegetable\u2014and then we can use the leftover chicken to make enchiladas. I\u2019ve been enjoying making enchiladas a lot recently. What else? We did the Korean barbecue thing and got a lot of meat from H Mart. Ooh! If I have the forethought to buy the inoculated koji rice, I like making shio koji and using it as a marinade for pork. A shio koji-marinated pork chop or pork loin is one of my favourite things to make, but I don\u2019t make it that often because I forget to buy the fuzzy rice.\n\nIt sounds like if it wasn\u2019t for this job you would just eat meat and popcorn.\n\nAnd salad! And I try to keep a fruit around, usually clementines or grapes or cherries. But I\u2019ve been eating more salads. Particularly if I make a salad dressing for work that I really like\u2014I did that burnt onion ranch.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite food to eat when you\u2019re sad?\n\nPhoto: Claire Lower\n\nWhen I\u2019m sad I love a cheese plate. I\u2019ll go to New Seasons and they sell the little cheese scraps, and it\u2019s still three dollars for a tiny wedge of cheese. It\u2019s still pretty expensive, but you can get a lot of them. So I\u2019ll get a blue, something like a Gruyere if I can find that, and then some other random cheddar or some shit, and I\u2019ll have that with pickles, olives, some sort of jam. The other night I took the Gruyere that we had and I dipped it in strawberry Bonne Maman jam, and that was a taste sensation.\n\nI\u2019ll also do popcorn if I\u2019m feeling a little fatigued. I\u2019ll do the method where you add a ton of oil to the pot, pop it in that, and then add Amish cheese powder and nutritional yeast, so you get two kinds of cheesy flavour, and then I add MSG on top of that, and it is fantastic.\n\nSo is that the kind of thing you usually eat for supper?\n\nIt\u2019s not all sad meals. Usually it\u2019s whatever I\u2019m cooking for my next article. I\u2019ve been eating beef stew because I\u2019m trying to perfect a beef stew recipe. I also took some pictures of what I have been eating so let\u2019s look at those. Can I do this without messing up the recording? I think I can. Yes I can. Let\u2019s look at my photos. So the other night, I had a box macaroni and cheese from Trader Joe\u2019s with bacon bits in it.\n\nChaotic! (Photo: Claire Lower)\n\nI\u2019m changing my question. What are the last five meals you ate?\n\nPhoto: Claire Lower\n\nMonday I think I just had french fries and martinis at Double Dragon. Tuesday I had boxed macaroni and cheese from Trader Joe\u2019s. We bought that when I was sick and I didn\u2019t feel like cooking. Then I put bacon bits in it, but I also put toum. And then I had rocky road Haagen-Dazs with my snack salt on top for dessert. And that was also the night that I dipped the cheese in the jam. Wednesday! The only picture I have Wednesday is a cocktail. But Wednesday was our leftover Lebanese food, all mixed together and fried in butter. It was mostly rice, so it was like fried rice. Then I added a couple of fried eggs, and sour cream for some reason. Thursday I went to Beast. So I had one really nice meal and the rest of it was like what a raccoon eats. I should be ashamed of myself, but I never am. On Sunday, for supper\u2014here\u2019s a picture. It\u2019s cubes of Gruyere with Trader Joe\u2019s cornichons, and then a Ferrari cocktail. And there\u2019s actually a Juul in the background because you left yours here, and I think I was hitting that between sips of Ferrari.\n\nHow do you cook your tomato sauce?\n\nI like adding butter to my sauce. And you think that\u2019s obscene because your people are from southern Italy, but I have spent more time in Northern Italy. But I think the Marcella Hazan sauce is a better soup than sauce. But I do think it\u2019s a good base. I\u2019ll usually add garlic, and wine, and a little fish sauce to that sauce, but I really like butter in a sauce. I think it adds richness. I think it adds a little body to it. Plus I\u2019m from the south and we just really like butter. But if I\u2019m making it for you I will\u2014because you actually can taste the butter. I thought maybe I could sneak it past you, but you\u2019ve caught it every time. You have a good palate and it\u2019s gotten better since you switched from smoking to Juuling. But anyway, if I\u2019m making it for you, I\u2019ll start with sausage. Onion, so much garlic, tomato paste, deglaze with wine, whole tomatoes and I almost always add fish sauce.\n\nI should be ashamed of myself, but I never am.\n\nWhat is \u201csnack salt\u201d?\n\nSnack salt is salt that is good enough to eat by itself, which is the Maldon flake salt\u2014the little pyramid flakes. I will take an individual flake of salt and mash it crunch it down! It\u2019s like a chip! It\u2019s like a potato chip but there\u2019s no potato. It\u2019s a salt crisp.\n\nWhat do you like to eat at fairs and carnivals?\n\nI like an elephant ear or a funnel cake. I like a fried Oreo or Snickers bar. I also really like a corn dog, obviously. The ribbon cut fries I think are fun but only at a carnival. I think they\u2019re garbage fries anywhere else, for some reason. Corn. I love corn on the cob or elote. And then just anything with a lot of cheese sauce. Even if they\u2019re just shitty nachos or potato wedges with cheese sauce.\n\nDo you prefer caramel apples or candy apples?\n\nYou know damn well! You know damn well it\u2019s a caramel apple. Candy apples are pointless!\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite style of pizza?\n\nSo, since I\u2019m from Mississippi I don\u2019t really have any regional pizza loyalty. My first pizza memory is the barbecue pizza from Pizza Hut when I was four.\n\nYou like barbecue pizza?\n\nIt was the first pizza I had. Don\u2019t be a snob! But what \u201ckind\u201d of pizza do I like? I like a crust that\u2019s foldable, with bubbles on the edge, and I like it to be properly cooked on the bottom. I like cornmeal on the bottom. A red sauce that isn\u2019t super sweet; I don\u2019t love a sweet red sauce. And then I love Hawaiian. I love pineapple on pizza.\n\nI don\u2019t have these regional shackles holding me back from experiencing things that taste good.\n\nOK, next question.\n\nNo. Wait. I\u2019m not done with my pizza answers! I love Hawaiian. As Natalie Wynn mentioned in her interview, it\u2019s a perfect balance of flavours, especially if you have a cured pork product along with it. You\u2019ve got the salty. You\u2019ve got the acid. You\u2019ve got the sweet. You\u2019ve got the richness from the cheese. It all makes perfect sense. But I also like the square-cut, Detroit-style pie with the cheese in the crust. Rowdy at Ranch makes a really good one and his ranch dressing is also really good.\n\nYou dip the pizza in the ranch, don\u2019t you?\n\nI do dip the pizza in the ranch, because you know what? I don\u2019t have these regional shackles holding me back from experiencing things that taste good.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite fast food place?\n\nOK, so it\u2019s between McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell. I love Popeyes a lot too. But Popeyes can be a little expensive. I have to have the red beans and rice, you have to have the macaroni and cheese, and then we both want mashed potatoes. And then why get fried chicken if you can\u2019t have leftover fried chicken? Cold fried chicken is really good. So it\u2019s about forty dollars but it is good. Also, here\u2019s a tip! Mix the mashed potatoes into the red beans and rice. But my favourite is probably McDonald\u2019s. An Egg McMuffin, hash browns, and Diet Coke is my favourite airport breakfast, and it\u2019s my favourite hungover breakfast. Though now I\u2019ve developed the Bologna McMuffin. I also love a Double Cheeseburger and some McNuggets, and I\u2019m obsessed with the sweet and sour sauce, which is the best fry dipping sauce.\n\nDo you eat ever at the airport?\n\nVERY pleased with myself (Photo: Claire Lower)\n\nThe only time I do is if I have an early morning flight because I\u2019m a really anxious traveller, so I\u2019m one of those people who gets to the airport an hour and a half to two hours early no matter what. But yeah, I\u2019ll get an Egg McMuffin, hash browns, and a Diet Coke. Other thank that eating in the airport depresses me. Though I have been tempted by a Panda Express. If I have a long layover I will usually get cheap airport wine\u2014the cheapest one they have\u2014or a kalimotxo, which is half red wine and half Coke.\n\nWhat\u2019s one of the most memorable things you\u2019ve eaten while travelling?\n\nI mean, everything in Copenhagen was quite good. And I didn\u2019t get to have a full meal at Relae, but that celery root dish really surprised me. Chef Jonathan Tam was like \u201cThis is going to taste like lasagna,\u201d and I\u2014a person who does not care for celery or its root\u2014was like \u201cUh huh, sure,\u201d and then it did. The combination of the savoury oil and all that butter somehow tasted like lasagna\u2014I still think about it.\n\nOther than that, two years ago I went to France\u2014not for work\u2014and some friends and I stayed at La Peetch\u2014Julia Child\u2019s freaking house\u2014which you can rent. And we took cooking classes in her kitchen, and made and ate all sorts of amazing things. I learned how to make a proper souffl\u00e9 and choux pastry, but more importantly I got to cook and then eat duck and potatoes au gratin.\n\nPhoto: Claire Lower\n\nBut\u2014and this is kind of a dirtbag hack\u2014one of my favourite things to do when I travel is buy a whole bunch of regional potato chips. That, and go to a McDonald\u2019s. British McNuggets are very bland, but they had a Cadbury egg McFlurry, which ruled. The British are also very good with crisp flavours. Roasted ham crisps? Yes, please.\n\nPhoto: Claire Lower\n\nHow much Diet Coke do you drink?\n\nI just drank two litres in 24 hours.\n\nThat\u2019s insane. How often do you do that?\n\nI purposely don\u2019t keep it in the house because I will drink three to four cans a day if I have Diet Coke in the house. I\u2019m trying to drink more water. I think it tastes really good with food. It cuts through a lot of rich and salty flavours but it\u2019s not sweet like a sugary soda. I mean it\u2019s sweet, but not in the way that sugar is. It doesn\u2019t coat your mouth like sugar does. But, weirdly, Diet Coke is the only configuration of aspartame that I enjoy.\n\nCan we see the inside of your fridge?\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be funny if I said \u201cno\u201d?\n\nPhoto: Claire Lower\n\nWhat condiments do you have in your fridge?\n\nAt any given time, I must have sour cream, soy sauce, fish sauce, mayonnaise\u2014I have to have mayonnaise. I currently have three types of mayonnaise in my kitchen. I have Duke\u2019s, which is a Southern brand that doesn\u2019t contain any sugar, and I have a Korean mayonnaise which is super sweet. I have to keep ketchup around for you. And now we\u2019re both really into the strawberry Bonne Maman jam and we went through a jar in two or three days.\n\nAre you a big dessert person?\n\nYes. I\u2019m one of those people who likes both the savoury and the sweet. My favourite baked good is a brownie from a boxed mix. I love those because they cost three fucking dollars, and they come together real quick. I\u2019ll use pistachio oil instead of vegetable oil, and that will make it a little nuttier. And sometimes I\u2019ll use coffee instead of water too. And a box mix always has\u2014the Ghirardelli one\u2014it always has a perfect shiny crust. It\u2019s chewy on the edges. It\u2019s fudgy in the centre. They\u2019re perfect. I don\u2019t see a reason to spend any time measuring anything. I hate baking. I used to be a baker but it reminds me too much of my time in chemistry, with all the weighing and precision, and I just refuse to be part of that anymore. I opted out of that.\n\nWith snack salt, natch. (Photo: Claire Lower)\n\nBut one of my favourite desserts, which I\u2019ve been very into recently, is a banana split. I like the one at Pied Cow the best, it\u2019s just a classic. I fucking love ice cream. But the best ice cream place if I\u2019m not getting a banana split? Pinolo Gelato. The pistachio gelato at Pinolo is so perfect, and their fior di latte! If you can just make something that\u2019s essentially sweetened dairy\u2014with no other flavours\u2014and freeze, that and have it be transcendent, you know that your method of making ice cream\u2014or gelato in this case\u2014is good, and you\u2019re not hiding anything behind crazy flavours.\n\nBanana splits I have known and loved (Photo: Claire Lower)\n\nDo you prefer cocktails, beer, or wine?\n\nWell I used to be heavily into craft beer and I was actually brewing my own beer for a while but now it makes me feel bloated and it makes me sneeze. Right before I turned 30 it started making me sneeze, which is apparently common for people with mould allergies, which I have. And since then I\u2019ve kind of lost the taste for beer, though I will occasionally drink a cheap shitty beer, and that doesn\u2019t make me sneeze. The fancier the beer, the more likely I am to sneeze. I like wine a lot and I do think I enjoy good wine, but I\u2019ve avoided really understanding wine because I\u2019m afraid once I develop that palate it\u2019ll be another expensive thing that I\u2019ll want to spend money on, and I don\u2019t need that. Because, as you know, I am a cocktail drinker, and it helps that I\u2019m friends with bartenders who, uh, help me out sometimes. But yeah, to answer your question: I\u2019m a cocktail person.\n\nSometimes An elaborate grasshopper from Double Dragon. (Photo: Claire Lower)\n\nWhat kind of cocktails?\n\nI am a big gin drinker. I\u2019m sure anyone who reads 3-Ingredient Happy Hour already knows all of this, but I like a martini, and I like tiki drinks but they\u2019re like a fun, occasional party drink. I\u2019ll drink a martini any fucking day of the week. I also am really into Hanky-Pankies. For some reason when I\u2019m DJing I like Paper Planes, but that\u2019s the only time I order them. And I also like super bitter amaro like Campari and Fernet. I like combining the two for a Ferrari, and then sprinkling a little salt in that. I put salt in everything.", "description": "Hello.
