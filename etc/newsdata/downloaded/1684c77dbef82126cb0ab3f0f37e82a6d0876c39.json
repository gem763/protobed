( V ) has been a rewarding investment over the past few years but investors and traders need to be forward-looking and less reactive in this fast-paced global environment.\n\nLet's check out the charts and technical indicators of this global credit-card business.\n\n(For more on Visa see Jim Cramer's column here .)\n\nIn the daily bar chart of V, below, we can see that prices made a low back in late December and quickly rallied higher and higher into late July. Over the past three months the price activity has changed a bit with the gains being digested and the indicators correcting. V is now trading below the declining 50-day moving average line. The line was very effective in the move higher and tests of the indicator were buying opportunities. In July V looks like it got extended above the rising 200-day moving average line so a correction is not unusual.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has started to move lower this month telling us that sellers of V have become more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator was above the zero line from the middle of January until the middle of September -- an interesting distinction.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of V, below, we can see why investors might be in love with the company or at least the stock -- an impressive uptrend. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line but notice that the weekly OBV line has been flat the past few months and trading volume has diminished all year.\n\nThe MACD oscillator has crossed to the downside for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of V, below, we can see a possible or tentative downside price target of $160. A trade at $187.86 will refresh the uptrend.\n\nBottom-line strategy: It looks like V may continue to correct its gains. A slow decline toward our Point and Figure target of $160 is possible and would probably be a buying opportunity as that represents the intersection of the 200-day moving average.", "description": "Visa Could Extend Its Advance After a Correction to the 200-Day Line...V", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Visa Could Extend Its Advance After A Correction To The Line", "It Looks Like V May Continue To Correct Its Gains.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Collins", "Bob Lang", "Peter Tchir", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/08eb1620-3127-11e8-9b34-b9188a31b524.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
