The officer\u2019s complaint has since sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cSecretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development,\u201d Shaylyn Hynes, a Perry spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nPresident Trump on Friday evening told House Republicans that it was Perry who had teed up the July call with Ukraine, according to a person familiar with Trump\u2019s new comments who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conference call.\n\nBut President Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, or a U.S. holdup in military aid to the country, the person said. The president\u2019s remarks on the late Friday call was first reported by Axios.\n\nPerry, the former governor of Texas and up to now a lower-profile but active member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, has made repeated trips to Ukraine and met often with Ukranian officials, including Zelenskiy. Perry and his agency say his involvement with Ukraine was part of U.S. policy, predating the Trump administration, to increase U.S. natural gas, coal and other supplies to Eastern Europe to lessen Russia\u2019s control of the region\u2019s energy market.\n\n\u201cHe continues to believe that there is significant need for improved regional energy security,\u201d Hynes said. Perry was heading to Lithuania again Sunday night, and would meet with nearly two dozen European energy officials, including those from Ukraine, she said.\n\nBoth President Trump and Zelensky have denied any pressure was applied to probe Biden, whose alleged corruption in Ukraine and China has garnered negative attention for the former vice president amid sinking 2020 poll numbers and a rising candidacy of rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).\n\n\u201cThere was no blackmail,\u201d Zelensky told reporters when asked Thursday about his call with President Trump. \u201cWe are not servants. We are an independent country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be pulled into this because I understand that my words could impact the elections of the American people,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "House Democrats subpoenaed Department of Energy Secretary\u00a0Rick Perry for Ukraine documents as part of their impeachment investigation.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1140758936-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
