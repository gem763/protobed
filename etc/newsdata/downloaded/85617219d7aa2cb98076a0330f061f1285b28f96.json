People are saying he was assaulted by the army but we don't know how true that is,\" he said.", "description": "Malawi police have fired tear gas at thousands of demonstrators who took to the streets of the capital Lilongwe, in the latest wave of protests over the disputed May presidential election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8905/ea4c9c7be1034ed9a2c47de6eb20f955.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
