Here are the five key talking points from the weekend.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Granada v FC Barcelona - Nuevo Estadio de Los Carmenes, Granada, Spain - September 21, 2019 Barcelona's Lionel Messi in action REUTERS/Marcelo Del Pozo\n\nMadrid\u2019s defensive solidity\n\nReal Madrid bounced back from the crushing 3-0 Champions League defeat by Paris St. Germain with a much more assured performance against Sevilla at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan.\n\nAlthough their opponents\u2019 trip to Baku in the Europa League on Thursday ensured Sevilla weren\u2019t at their freshest, Madrid played with grit and intensity.\n\nFor the first time since August 2016 they kept a La Liga opponent firmly at bay, not allowing a single shot on target during the match.\n\n\u201cWe played for 90 minutes at a great level at a complicated stadium,\u201d said coach Zinedine Zidane. \u201cThis is the game that has satisfied me the most since I returned (in March).\n\n\u201cWe had difficult moments but the solidarity we showed in those moments stands out.\u201d\n\nBarca\u2019s away day trauma\n\nBarcelona haven't travelled well since April last season and their away day trauma shows no signs of abating.\n\nThe Catalans have drawn three and lost five of their last eight competitive games away from Camp Nou, including the 4-0 capitulation against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final and the Copa del Rey final defeat by Valencia.\n\nIn Granada, they failed to create many chances and meekly fell to defeat, despite captain Lionel Messi making his first league appearance after a calf injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried because away from home we\u2019re not getting good results,\u201d said coach Ernesto Valverde.\n\n\u201cNo wins from four away games this season is a clear symptom we\u2019re not in a very good situation.\u201d\n\nValencia protests rage on\n\nDespite their Champions League win over Chelsea in midweek, Valencia fans are still furious with owner Peter Lim for sacking coach Marcelino Garcia Toral.\n\nThe coach was dismissed on Sept. 11 despite winning the Spanish cup and helping Los Che to a second consecutive fourth place league finish.\n\nPlayers and supporters were furious with the decision and fans showed that with banners demanding Lim leave as they filled the street in front of the Mestalla on Sunday.\n\nThe team, now led by Albert Celades, stumbled to a 1-1 draw with bottom of the table Leganes and sit 12th.\n\nFortress San Mames\n\nAt home, no side has got the better of Athletic Bilbao since October 2018.\n\nThey beat Alaves 2-0 on Sunday to move joint top of La Liga on 11 points from five matches, going unbeaten for the 17th league match in a row at home.\n\nRaul Garcia\u2019s penalty and Iker Muniain\u2019s second half strike from close range handed the Basque side a comfortable victory at the fortress that is the San Mames.\n\nAtletico blowing best chance in years\n\nFILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Europa League - Valencia Press Conference - Sports City of Paterna, Valencia, Spain - May 8, 2019 Valencia coach Marcelino Garcia Toral during a press conference REUTERS/Heino Kalis\n\nWith neither Real Madrid or Barcelona near their best, this seemed like a fine chance for 2014 champions Atletico Madrid to capitalise.\n\nThree wins from three games implied Diego Simeone's side was on the right track but defeat at Real Sociedad and a 0-0 draw with Celta Vigo on Saturday show Atletico are a flawed side too.\n\nAtletico are one of four sides on 10 points, with many teams bunched together in the top half as no side has emerged as a consistent force.", "description": "Real Madrid beat Sevilla 1-0 on Sunday to move joint top of La Liga, while champions Barcelona stumbled to shock 2-0 defeat at Granada on Saturday.
