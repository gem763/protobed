REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nThe senators, Republican Josh Hawley and Democrats Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal, are introducing the bill at a time when there is growing concern that Facebook, along with Alphabet\u2019s Google, have become so powerful that smaller rivals are unable to lure away their users.\n\nThe bill would require communications platforms with more than 100 million monthly active members - Facebook has more than two billion - to allow its users to easily move, or port, their data to another network.\n\nThe idea, which is already part of European law, has the support of Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who leads the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee.\n\nData portability has been promoted in the past as giving consumers the power to move their data, which could spur the growth of social media alternatives that offer features such as greater privacy or less advertising.\n\nThe companies would be required to maintain an interface to facilitate this interoperability. Or users would be allowed to choose another company to manage a user\u2019s account settings, content, and online interactions.\n\nFacebook has been hit by a number of privacy-related issues recently, including a glitch that exposed to its employees the passwords of millions of users which had been stored in readable format within its internal systems. The social media giant is also under strict data protections imposed by the company\u2019s $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which was announced in July.\n\n\u201cBy enabling portability, interoperability, and delegatability, this bill will help put consumers in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to how and where they use social media,\u201d said Sen. Warner, a former technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist.\n\nBut the Electronic Frontier Foundation has pointed out that on its own \u201cdata portability cannot magically improve competition; the ability to take your data to another service is not helpful if there are no viable competitors.\u201d\n\nFacebook said in September it \u201csupports the principle of data portability\u201d but did not outline specific future actions, and tech industry lobbyists at the Internet Association support the concept.", "description": "Three U.S. lawmakers active in tech issues will introduce a bill requiring social networks like Facebook to allow users to pack up their data and go elsewhere, Warner's office said in a statement on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443686450&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0U0", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
