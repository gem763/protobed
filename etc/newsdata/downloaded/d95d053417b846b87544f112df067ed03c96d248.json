Although, on average, around 105 males are born for every 100 female births, in this study the sex ratio among the physically and psychologically stressed groups was a male-to-female ratios of 4:9 and 2:3, respectively.\n\n\"Other researchers have seen this pattern after social upheavals, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City, after which the relative number of male births decreased,\" says study leader Catherine Monk, Ph.D. \"This stress in women is likely of long-standing nature; studies have shown that males are more vulnerable to adverse prenatal environments, suggesting that highly stressed women may be less likely to give birth to a male due to the loss of prior male pregnancies, often without even knowing they were pregnant.\"\n\nThe findings, published online in the journal PNAS (the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), also showed that mothers who were psychologically stressed had more birth complications than those who were physically stressed, and physically stressed mothers were more likely to give birth prematurely than the unstressed mothers.\n\nThe fetuses of of physically stressed mothers also had reduced heart rate-movement coupling -- which indicates a slower development of the central nervous system development -- compared with unstressed mothers.\n\nHowever, the negative effect of stress appeared to be offset by social support from friends and family. For example, the more social support a mother received, the more she was likely to give birth to a boy.\n\n\"Screening for depression and anxiety are gradually becoming a routine part of prenatal practice,\" says Monk. \"But while our study was small, the results suggest enhancing social support is potentially an effective target for clinical intervention.\"", "description": "New US research has found that women who experience stress during their pregnancy are more likely to give birth to a girl than a boy and have a higher risk of birth complications.
