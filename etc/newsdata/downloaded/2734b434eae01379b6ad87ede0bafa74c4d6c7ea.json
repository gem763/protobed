If the House votes for this bill tomorrow, the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on 17 October to sort this out and take this country forward,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Mr Johnson\u2019s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour indicated that it will not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no deal is passed.\n\nMr Corbyn told him: \u201cGet the bill through first in order to take no deal off the table.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street source confirmed that the party whip was being withdrawn from MPs who failed to back the PM - including grandees like former chancellors Kenneth Clarke and Philip Hammond as well as Sir Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson Sir Nicholas Soames.\n\nChief whip Mark Spencer was talking to 21 Tory rebels, who are also set to be barred from standing as Conservative candidates at the next election. They also included members of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet Greg Clark, David Gauke, Rory Stewart and Justine Greening as well as Guto Bebb, Richard Benyon, Steve Brine, Alistair Burt, Dominic Grieve, Sam Gyimah, Stephen Hammond, Richard Harrington, Margot James, Sir Oliver Letwin, Anne Milton, Caroline Nokes, Antoinette Sandbach and Ed Vaizey.\n\nAny Tories who abstained in the vote will also lose the whip, in a move which leaves Mr Johnson at least 43 votes short of a majority in the Commons, even with the support of his Democratic Unionist Party allies.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

What has happened to the Conservative Party?\u201d\n\nIf it clears the Commons as expected on Wednesday, the \u201crebel alliance\u201d bill faces stiff resistance in the House of Lords, where Tory peers are understood to have tabled more than 90 amendments in a bid to prevent it completing its passage by the end of the week.\n\nMeanwhile, some 18 Labour backers of EU withdrawal have tabled an amendment in the Commons which would revive proposals raised in cross-party talks involving Theresa May, based on her own deal which was rejected three times by the Commons.\n\nThe dramatic vote came after Mr Johnson lost his remaining one-vote majority in the Commons as Remain-supporting former minister Phillip Lee crossed the floor to join the Liberal Democrat benches while the PM was on his feet delivering a statement on last month\u2019s G7 summit.\n\nMoving the emergency motion, Sir Oliver said that MPs must take their last chance to secure a parliamentary block on the government taking the UK into a no-deal Brexit, which he said represented \u201ca threat to our prosperity and our Union\u201d.\n\nDespite Mr Johnson\u2019s claims of progress in talks with Brussels, there was only a \u201cslender\u201d chance of the government reaching a deal at the 17 October summit of the European Council or ratifying it by the 31 October deadline, said Sir Oliver.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow faced repeated challenges from Tory Eurosceptics to his decision to allow MPs to vote on a substantive motion in a rarely-used parliamentary procedure.\n\nBut he won cheers from the opposition benches as he borrowed some of Mr Johnson\u2019s own catchphrases to say that he would \u201cfacilitate the House of Commons \u2026 Come what may, do or die\u201d.\n\nLeader of the Commons and arch-Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg branded the motion \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and insisted that the rebels\u2019 aim was to \u201cdeny Brexit\u201d and create \u201ca marionette government in which there is only nominal confidence\u201d.\n\nMr Rees-Mogg said: \u201cParliament sets itself against the people. Sovereignty comes from the people to parliament, it doesn\u2019t come to parliament out of a void.\n\n\u201cIf parliament tries to challenge the people, this stretches the elastic of our constitution near to breaking point. We should recognise that the people are our masters and show us to be their lieges and servants not place ourselves in the position of their overlords.\u201d\n\nWelcoming the result of the vote, Mr Corbyn said: \u201cThere is no consent in this House to leave the European Union without a deal. There is no majority for no deal in the country.\n\n\u201cAs I have said before: if the prime minister has confidence in his Brexit policy \u2013 when he has one he can put forward \u2013 he should put it before the people in a public vote.\n\n\u201cHe wants to table a motion for a general election? Fine, get the bill through first in order to take no deal off the table.\u201d\n\nDowning Street declined to confirm that Mr Johnson\u2019s election motion would propose a nationwide poll on 14 October, as previously indicated. Reports suggested the motion to be moved tomorrow might instead specify 15 October.", "description": "Rebel MPs have defied threats from Boris Johnson to vote through a motion paving the way for legislation to block a no-deal Brexit.
