Brush Fire: 'This Is What Climate Change Looks Like'", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Monday used the wildfire in California threatening the heart of Los Angeles to push her climate change agenda, writing \u201cthis is what climate change looks like\u201d and warning that \u201cscenes like this\u201d will \u201cget much worse\u201d if the U.S. does not cut its carbon emissions in half over the next ten years.\n\nA brush fire broke out early Monday morning \u201cclose to the southbound side of the 405 Freeway at Getty Center Drive near the Getty Center museum,\u201d prompting hundreds of thousands of evacuations.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports evacuation orders have been issued from the top of Mandeville Canyon Road down to Sunset Boulevard, from Mandeville Canyon east to the 405 Freeway. An evacuation warning zone was also set for west of Interstate 405, south of Mulholland Drive, north of Sunset Boulevard, and east of Topanga Canyon. \u201cPeople in the area \u2026 are advised to prepare to evacuate due to a rapidly moving brush fire,\u201d the fire department said in a statement posted on Nixle. Elsewhere, as nearly 200,000 people remain under evacuation order from threat of wildfires, some of the millions of people in Northern California on track to get their electricity back may not have power restored before another possible round of shut-offs and debilitating winds.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz did not mince words, warning residents in mandatory evacuation zones to \u201cget the hell out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the mandatory evacuation zone and you\u2019re still there watching this, you\u2019re an idiot, get the hell out,\u201d he stated.\n\nOcasio-Cortez responded to the news of the devastating fire, using the tragedy to push her Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cThis is what climate change looks like,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe GOP like to mock scientific warnings about climate change as exaggeration. But just look around: it\u2019s already starting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have 10 years to cut carbon emissions in half. If we don\u2019t, scenes like this can get much worse,\u201d she warned, using the hashtag \u201c#GreenNewDeal\u201d:\n\nThis is what climate change looks like.

However, investigators have yet to pinpoint the exact cause.\n\nTownhall references an argument made by Chuck Devore, the Vice President of National Initiatives at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and a former California lawmaker, who argues that it is \u201cdecades of environmental mismanagement that has created a tinderbox of unharvested timber, dead trees, and thick underbrush\u201d that has caused these massive wildfires\u2013 not climate change.\n\nHe wrote in Forbes:\n\nThis is California\u2019s big secret: it\u2019s not climate change that\u2019s burning up the forests, killing people, and destroying hundreds of homes; it\u2019s decades of environmental mismanagement that has created a tinderbox of unharvested timber, dead trees, and thick underbrush. This dangerous situation attracted attention from President Donald Trump who, during the height of California\u2019s wildfires last year insisted that \u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.\u201d The irony is that forest management is so bad on public lands that a new report, ordered by the California legislature in 2010, shows that the portion of California\u2019s National Forests protected from timber harvesting is now a net contributor to atmospheric carbon dioxide due to fires and trees killed by insects and disease. \u2026 If federal and state environmental policies continue to make it difficult and costly to harvest timber and manage the fuel load, then the wildfires will continue and they will be bigger and deadlier. This will, in due course, cause some politicians to blame the fires on climate change.\n\nMany users responded to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweet, criticizing the freshman lawmaker for ignoring the complexity of the issue in order to aggressively push her progressive agenda.\n\n\u201cAOC PG&E has an aging infrastructure and needs to be updated and underground cable. Get your facts right,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is what it looks like when state law prohibits clearing of dead brush and debris from forests,\u201d another tweeted.\n\n\u201cThis is what poor forest management and antiquated, faulty and dangerous power lines failing looks like!\u201d another added.\n\nThe latest media briefing on the Getty fire can be seen below:", "description": "Rep.
