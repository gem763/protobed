The upshot, according to some of these people, is that essential design changes didn\u2019t receive adequate FAA attention.\n\nThe report, these officials said, also is expected to fault the agency for what it describes as inadequate data sharing with foreign authorities during its original certification of the Max two years ago, along with relying on mistaken industrywide assumptions about how average pilots would react to certain flight-control emergencies. FAA officials have said they are devising new pilot-reaction guidelines after two fatal crashes.\n\nExpected to be released in the next few weeks, the document would be the first official outside review of Max certification since the fleet was grounded world-wide in March after the crashes. The planes nosedived after repeated misfires of an automated flight-control system, called MCAS, which pushed down the noses of both aircraft despite efforts by their pilots to pull the planes out of their steep dives.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\nTrump has few options to respond to Saudi oil attack.\n\nYour parents\u2019 financial advice is (kind of) wrong.", "description": "A panel of international air-safety regulators is finishing a report expected to criticize the initial U.S. approval process for Boeing Co.\u2019s 737 MAX jets,...", "authors": ["Andy Pasztor", "Andrew Tangel"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF541_boeing_ZG_20190312154044.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
