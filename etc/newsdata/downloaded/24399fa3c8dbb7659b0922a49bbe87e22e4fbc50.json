(Seth Tillman/\u00a9 Seth Tillman for WETA)\n\nColumnist\n\nSherry Starr has a T-shirt her kids gave her that reads, \u201cI was country when country wasn\u2019t cool.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a line from a Barbara Mandrell song. We were talking about country music, me and Sherry, who\u2019s 83 and lives in Silver Spring.\n\nYou can\u2019t have missed the fact that PBS is showing Ken Burns\u2019s eight-episode, 16-hour documentary on the history of country music. The series has made Sherry ponder her own introduction to the music, back in the 1950s when she was an undergrad at the University of Maryland.\n\nShe was walking down a hallway in her dorm when she heard music coming from the room of a girl she didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t know the music either \u2014 it was probably Hank Williams, Sherry thinks now \u2014 so she stuck her head in.\n\n\u201cShe had a little old radio,\u201d Sherry said. \u201cI said, \u2018What\u2019s that music?\u2019 And she said, \u2018I\u2019m from the hills of West Virginia, and we call it hillbilly.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was hooked for life.\u201d\n\nSherry had been into rock and roll, but now her heart was set on country. She\u2019d go to the Music Box, a record store in Langley Park, where the owner would let her sit on the floor behind the counter and spread out 45s, deciding what to buy.\n\nWhat was the appeal?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because of the words,\u201d Sherry said. \u201cThe philosophy is so true to life. It\u2019s what people are living, what emotions they\u2019re feeling.\u201d\n\nSherry worked for 30 years at the University of Maryland, where she trained marriage counselors. That seems like a pretty good job for a fan of country music, a genre that can go from \u201cStand By Your Man\u201d to \u201cD-I-V-O-R-C-E\u201d in a heartbeat.\n\nSherry\u2019s late husband, Henry, was an ophthalmologist who\u2019d gone to high school at tony Sidwell Friends and medical school at Johns Hopkins. Sherry did not encounter many country music fans among those crowds.\n\n\u201cWhen my husband wanted to be really nice to me, he took me to the Stardust in Waldorf to see Tammy Wynette,\u201d she said.\n\nWynette was a favorite. So were Loretta Lynn, Conway Twitty, Merle Haggard and Reba McEntire.\n\n\u201cMy very favorite is Kris Kristofferson,\u201d Sherry said. \u201cBut I do not call him country. I think he\u2019s in a category all by himself.\u201d\n\nShe recited a Kristofferson lyric: \u201cHe\u2019s a walking contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction.\u201d\n\nSaid Sherry: \u201cI think that should be on my tombstone.\u201d\n\nAnd it might serve as a motto for Washington itself. This area has always been an incongruous country hotbed, its artists, promoters and fans vital to the music\u2019s success. Ken Burns touches on some of those figures in his documentary \u2014 Winchester, Va.\u2019s Patsy Cline, for example \u2014 but he didn\u2019t have room for others.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason WETA produced six mini-documentaries that are being broadcast as part of the country music epic. The shorts \u2014 from two to six minutes each \u2014 were produced by Seth Tillman and Mark Jones and explore D.C.-area aspects of country music.\n\n\u201cWe felt it was a really good opportunity for a lot of people who are newcomers to the area,\u201d Seth said. \u201cProbably the last thing they think of is D.C. as a country town. Of course, it was.\u201d\n\nSeth traveled to Nashville to interview sisters Roni and Donna Stoneman, part of the famed Stoneman Family who lived in Prince George\u2019s County. Mark spent time with Rob Miller, who used to catch bluegrass acts at the Friendly Inn in Ellicott City, Md. When that place closed, he started inviting bands and audiences to a barn behind his Maryland house.\n\nThere\u2019s Cleve Francis, the Northern Virginia cardiologist who in the 1990s put his medical career on hold to seek country stardom.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve really enjoyed about this process is the people we connected with have been just incredible to work with,\u201d Mark said. \u201cThey are really passionate about what they do, but also passionate about sharing their stories.\u201d\n\nOne of the mini-docs is about Connie B. Gay, a promoter and radio station owner who was central to country music.\n\n\u201cA lot of people benefited from the work he did,\u201d Seth said. \u201cRoy Clark, Jimmy Dean, Patsy Cline all got their start here and owed a good share of their success to Connie\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nThe pieces are being broadcast at various times on WETA. You can find them online at weta.org/countrymusic.\n\nWorking on the project has had an effect on both men, one that will probably be familiar to people watching the Burns documentary: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more country music on my Apple Music playlist,\u201d Seth said.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Even at 16 hours, Ken Burns didn\u2019t have room for everything.
