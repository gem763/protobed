And it was big.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of tugging, Washington said his arms felt like he had \"been lifting weights all day.\"\n\n\"It became a massive fight,\" Washington told ABC News on Tuesday.\n\nCourtesy George Washington\n\nBut finally, he managed to tire his catch out and reel it in.\n\nWashington said the 60-pound fish, measuring 4 feet, 1 inch, was the biggest he's ever caught. When he tried to weigh it using three different scales, all of which maxed out at 50 pounds, the fish's size crushed them.\n\n\"Once all his weight dropped, one broke, one malfunctioned and one would not give an accurate read,\" he said.\n\nWashington said he had to call wildlife rangers for a proper weighing.\n\nFlathead catfish can reach a size of 3 to 4 feet and weigh more than 100 pounds, according to the Texas Park and Wildlife.\n\nWashington said he filleted the fish after he caught it and froze it to enjoy later, filling up a five gallon bucket.\n\n\"You could feed five or six families,\" he added.", "description": "Fisherman George Washington reeled in a 60-pound catfish.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/fisherman-ht-flt-aa-191029_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
