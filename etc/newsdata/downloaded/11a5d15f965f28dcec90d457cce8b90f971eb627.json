However, unlike other quick-service restaurants capturing this market with the help of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, customers shouldn't expect to see Beyond Tacos or Impossible Tacos.\n\nAccording to a press release from Taco Bell, the chain isn\u2019t trying to reinvent the wheel. But rather, it is working with the ingredients it has to appease vegetarian diets. In the chain's own words: \u201cWe\u2019ve actually got years in our pocket making a mean bean burrito.\u201d\n\nTaco Bell\u2019s Chief Food Innovation Officer Liz Matthews told FOX Business Tuesday that the chain isn't opposed to adding faux meat to its menu, but the brand's focus is on reinvigorating what they already have.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ll never do that. It\u2019s really easy for brands to do what everyone else is doing,\" she said. \"We want to go after things that are really exciting and are successful, and not just mediocre. At this point, we\u2019re not leaning into that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRival taco chain, Del Taco, on the other hand has embraced alternative meat. The California-based Tex-Mex chain introduced its customers to meatless tacos sourced from Beyond Meat in April. Within two months, Del Taco reported it sold two million meatless tacos.\n\n\u201cIt provides vegans and vegetarians or anyone wanting to cut down red meat consumption with more variety and convenience than they have today,\u201d Del Taco President and CEO John Cappasola recently told USA TODAY,\u201cYou can have a taco experience without feeling like you\u2019re sacrificing,\u201d he said.\n\nOther fast food staples have jumped on the plant-based meat substitute train to meet customer demand. This includes Kentucky Fried Chicken's meatless chicken nugget test run, Burger King's \"Impossible Burger\" and White Castle's \"Impossibe Sliders.\"\n\nAlthough fast food has moved to capture the non-meat eating market, a July market research report from NPD Group found that 95 percent of customers who order plant-based meals aren't strictly vegetarian or vegan. In fact, most buyers are simply diversifying their diet, which makes sense considering U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods are up 11 percent in 2019 according to financial service company Barclays.\n\nAnalysts also estimate that the faux meat sector could reach $140 billion within the next decade.\n\nFor the hardcore meat avoiders out there, Taco Bell\u2019s alternative menu is certified by the American Vegetarian Association. In total, there are 13 options, including the 7-Layer Burrito, Black Bean Crunchwrap and the cheese quesadilla, the AVA has certified as vegetarian-friendly.\n\nIf these offerings don\u2019t impress you, Taco Bell allows for customization with 36 AVA certified ingredients. Even better, 26 of these ingredients are vegan-friendly so those with stricter diets won't get left behind.\n\nTaco Bell sells 350 million vegetarian items a year and about 7% of all items ordered at Taco Bell are either vegetarian or made meatless by substitution or removal, according to the company.\n\nOutside of what the AVA has given their stamp of approval for, there are 10 other meatless options at Taco Bell, including Triple Layer Nachos, a meatless grilled breakfast burrito and a meatless Fiesta Taco Salad. But it\u2019s important to note that those menu items may have made contact with meat products via frying oil and food prep.\n\nThe vegetarian-friendly roll out will be at more than 7,000 participating restaurants Thursday and a first-ever vegetarian digital campaign earlier this year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThis vegetarian announcement comes at a time when Taco Bell is overhauling its menu.
