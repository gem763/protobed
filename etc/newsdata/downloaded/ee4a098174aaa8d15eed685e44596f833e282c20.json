The consortium is willing to go through a bidding process to take over the project, the people said. Pakistan\u2019s provincial government spokesman didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nAn international tribunal run by the World Bank in July ordered Pakistan to pay $5.8 billion in damages to Barrick Gold and Antofagasta after the country denied them a license to develop the Reko Diq mine in 2011. Collecting the funds though may be a challenge, given Pakistan\u2019s fragile economic state. The damages almost match the International Monetary Fund\u2019s $6 billion bailout for Pakistan earlier this year to help the South Asian nation avert an economic crisis.\n\nThe provincial chief minister has expressed a preference for Pakistani companies to take over the mine, the Dawn newspaper reported earlier this month. The business groups that showed interest in the mining project are: Yunus Brothers Group that owns Lucky Cement Ltd., Arif Habib Group, Fatima Group and the owners of Liberty Power Tech Ltd., the people said. The four are being led by Shamsuddin Shaikh, who spearheaded a group of companies to mine coal from Pakistan\u2019s Thar desert for the first time.\n\nReko Diq is one of the largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits in the world, capable of producing 200,000 tons of copper and 250,000 ounces of gold a year for more than half a century, according to a feasibility study before the dispute. The capital investment at the time would have exceeded $3 billion.", "description": "Group of Pakistani business leaders reportedly wants control of one of the world's biggest reserves of gold and copper.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/e3b7ae044261407792f9d0f8527e1b11_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
