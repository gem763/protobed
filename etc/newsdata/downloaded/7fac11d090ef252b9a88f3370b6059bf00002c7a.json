Fire officials said they were investigating witness reports in local media linking the fire to a power transmission line.\n\nThe Saddleridge was the largest among a spate of wildfires across California that burned a total of nearly 160,000 acres (64,000 hectares) and destroyed 134 structures in recent days, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nA separate, smaller fire east of Los Angeles in Riverside County killed two people and destroyed dozens of homes last week. That blaze began when burning refuse dumped by a garbage truck ignited dry vegetation on the ground.", "description": "Deadly Los Angeles wildfire burns with subdued fury after change in weather", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9C0JL_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
