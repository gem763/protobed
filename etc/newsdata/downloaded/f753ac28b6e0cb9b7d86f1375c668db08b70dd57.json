The proposal would require all charter school teachers to obtain the same credentials as district school teachers.\n\nThat would fundamentally undermine charter school autonomy in one of the areas most important to charter school leaders; namely, who teaches in their classrooms.\n\nCalifornia already compels charter schools to hire teachers with \u201ca state-approved credential in all core academic subjects, including English language arts, math, science, and social studies.\u201d The new regulations would also require those who teach electives, such as music and art, to obtain state-approved credentials.\n\nThese certifications will cost phys-ed and music teachers nearly $300, while art teachers will have to pay more than $260. Those costs do not include the time, energy, and transportation teachers will expend to acquire the state-mandated credentials.\n\nInnovative charter schools are popular with Californians as they enroll about 10 percent of students. Their popularity increased dramatically in the past decade, which saw enrollment increase by 150 percent.\n\nOpponents of charter schools claim that state-mandated teacher credentials are needed to ensure school quality. Such regulations, however, would vastly limit the pool of potential teachers, because credentialing is a lengthy and burdensome process\u2014which research suggests provides limited, if any, value.\n\nResearch from the Brookings Institution, for example, shows that there is no difference between teachers who are traditionally certified, alternatively certified, or not certified at all.\n\nCompulsory certification also means highly qualified professionals with subject-matter expertise and experience will be barred from bringing their skills to the classroom, absent a government seal of approval.\n\nPeople like Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice could not teach in their respective fields of computer science, music, or political science without state certification.\n\nThe waters are further muddied since the new skills-based credentials are often conflated with California\u2019s Certificate of Clearance, which guarantees that prospective teachers receive the necessary background checks to ensure student safety.\n\nAt the end of the day, state-required teacher credentialing is a win for teachers unions. By creating more barriers to the teaching profession, the jobs of unionized teachers in district schools are artificially protected from charter school competition.\n\nAs education-policy specialist Mike McShane commented in Forbes, \u201cLarge, wealthy, incumbent actors can actually start to influence the ways legislation or regulations are written in order to stifle their competition. Traditional teacher preparation programs can lobby states to write regulations that make alternative certification paths more difficult.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s proposed teacher-certification regulations are a clear instance of regulatory capture and aim to strangle charter competition.\n\nInstead of allowing special-interest groups to drive policy about the personnel decisions made in local schools, policymakers should follow the lead of Arizona, enabling school leaders to determine the people and practices that will best serve students in the state.\n\nArizona does not require state certification of charter school teachers, allowing school principals to make hiring decisions independently. Arizona charter schools must specify their teacher qualifications in their charter applications and keep employee resumes and employment histories on hand for parents or anyone else at all times.\n\nMoreover, Arizona\u2019s policy is complemented by a charter school system that enables families to drive accountability in the sector. Nearly 20 percent of Arizona students are enrolled in charter schools.\n\nAs researcher Matt Ladner noted in EducationNext, \u201cWhen parents don\u2019t like a school, they can simply vote with their feet, either by withdrawing their children from the school or by not choosing it in the first place. It is, therefore, parents, rather than state officials, who play the primary role in holding Arizona charter schools accountable, in a highly efficient manner.\u201d\n\nWhile charter schools are awarded 15-year authorizations in Arizona, most underperforming charter schools closed within four years of opening because dissatisfied families left for better schools.\n\nAttrition, driven by families leaving due to dissatisfaction, as Ladner explains, creates strong accountability that shutters underperforming schools before state officials do.\n\nArizona\u2019s free and open education market forces schools to respond to families and orient their services toward family needs.\n\nGreat Hearts Academy in Arizona is a superb example of the unique niche charter schools fill. There, teachers lead students in Socratic Method Seminars (roundtable discussions) and cultivate virtue in students\u2014one of the most important qualities parents seek in their children\u2019s schools.\n\nThe fruits of Arizona charter school innovation was illustrated in the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress results, in which fourth- and eighth-graders in charter schools consistently outperformed their district school peers in math and reading.\n\nIn fact, these charter schools, unlike their district school peers, consistently approximated the national assessment performance of students in Massachusetts, who routinely perform at the top of the pack in the nation.\n\nArizona charter schools are achieving their success without state-mandated teacher certification and heavy-handed regulations.\n\n\u201cFor decades, parents have allowed the $600 billion public education cabal to professionalize them out of the educational equation, basically demanding we shut up, hand our children over, and let the experts do their work,\u201d wrote Education Post CEO Chris Stewart at Project Free Forever. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t worked out. Schools today remain mediocre, and education policy offers little hope for systemic change.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers in California would do well to trust the decisions of parents.\n\n\u201cTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I \u2013 / I took the one less traveled by, / and that has made all the difference,\u201d Frost wrote in the conclusion of his famous poem.\n\nFreedom for parents to choose and freedom for schools to lead is making all the difference in Arizona.
