Plenty of Democrats do this, in fact \u2014 Pete Buttigieg did so eloquently at the same town hall where O\u2019Rourke took his controversial stand, talking about how marriage to his husband brought him to a deeper understanding of Christian service, subordinating the self to the needs of another. Is that the model that other Democrats should follow, as commentators like Frank Bruni have suggested?\n\nPerhaps, but I\u2019m not so sure it will help. It\u2019s not obviously a big improvement to move from \u201creligion is benighted and wrong,\u201d to \u201cactually, I\u2019m religious and so I can tell you that your particular religious views are benighted and wrong.\u201d Inasmuch as we share a spiritual vocabulary, religious language can be used to call us to live up to our professed ideals. It\u2019s much harder to use such language against churches themselves as institutions.\n\nWhat\u2019s required is not just the language of faith but the language of respect, even of profound differences, differences which, from the liberal as well as the conservative perspective, are fundamental and basically moral. It means, ultimately, seeking a truce on at least some fronts in the culture war. Unfortunately, it\u2019s neither easy nor obvious how to do that without devaluing causes that liberals take very seriously indeed.", "description": "", "authors": ["Noah Millman", "Theweek.Com Articles Democrats-Religion-Conundrum"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
