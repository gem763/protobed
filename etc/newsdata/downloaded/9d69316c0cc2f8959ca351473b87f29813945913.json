Republican leaders could in various ways support one or all three of them. There are also other Republicans who might well be stronger candidates for the nomination and who may well be more qualified to serve as president. Those individuals could be encouraged by colleagues, activists and donors, privately or publicly, to run \u2014 and they could be offered support if they do.\n\nAnd may I say directly to those Republicans who could run: You have a unique chance to act for your party and your country. You can play a role in overcoming the shame and stain of the past three years, and in the reformation of a once great party. Win or lose, you will go down in the history books as a man or woman of honor.\n\nThe Republican Party has surely discovered over the past few years the wisdom of Virgil: \u201cThe gates of hell are open night and day; Smooth the descent, and easy is the way.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["William Kristol", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Whistleblower-Election.Html"], "top_image": ""}
