Opposition parties have nearly all been won round and there will be a general election on December 12.\n\nThere will be plenty of comments about turkeys voting for Christmas and speculation about which parties will benefit from this early poll. But one thing is clear: it will not resolve the Brexit crisis, which has paralysed our politics for the past three years.\n\nA general election is what it says \u2013 \u2018general\u2019, covering a multitude of issues from the economy to education to the NHS to local campaigns. It will not deliver clarity on Brexit, or indeed on anything else.\n\nIf we want a specific answer to Brexit, we need to ask a specific question. A general election will not do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth the main parties, Labour and Conservative, have MPs who cover the full Brexit spectrum from deep Euro-scepticism to passionate Europhiles. If either of them end up with a majority, will we be any the wiser about national support for leave or remain? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nTen days ago, a million people marched through London demanding a final say on Brexit. They weren\u2019t asking for a general election, they want a vote on Brexit. Nearly all opinion polls indicate that support for remaining in the EU is growing. The more Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal is scrutinised the more people realise what a con it is, and the more they want a final say.\n\nYet at this very moment, it\u2019s being kicked down the road.\n\nPolitics is all too often a cynical business, but the current gaming of the system for party advantage is deeply disappointing. All previous, and legitimate, objections to an early election have been forgotten as nearly all the parties sign up for one \u2013 even though it plays into Boris Johnson\u2019s hands, allowing him to conveniently take the spotlight off his failure to deliver Brexit by October 31 \u2018do or die\u2019.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats want one before Brexit because it hopes to scoop up votes in pro-Remain Conservative seats.\n\nThe SNP too has its own internal reasons for wanting an early poll.\n\nWhich left Labour being forced to join the rush, so the party wouldn\u2019t leave itself open to the charge of running scared of the voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now face the prospect of giving a huge platform to Johnson and Nigel Farage, political insiders dressed up as rebels, whose main agenda is widespread chaos in which division will.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why a general election is not the way to resolve Brexit. The first-past-the-post system consistently delivers a parliamentary majority to a political party which has only minority support. Even the Labour landslide of 1997 was won with only 43 per cent support. David Cameron secured his majority in 2015 with less than 37 per cent of the vote.\n\nDespite the hours of parliamentary time spent on Brexit, the biggest crisis we face is the climate emergency and the collapse in our biodiversity.\n\nOur broken and deeply undemocratic system delivers huge power to a party which does not have the support of most people in the country. That cannot continue.\n\nBut if we are to have an election, however flawed our system, it is very clear to me the choice that voters need to make.\n\nDespite the hours of parliamentary time spent on Brexit, the biggest crisis we face is the climate emergency and the collapse in our biodiversity. The Committee on Climate Change has warned that the next parliament will be absolutely vital if we are to get off our current collision course with climate catastrophe. This will be the first general election where climate change should be front and centre.\n\nThe thousands who have marched every month on the Fridays-for-future climate strikes, the thousands who gave their support to the Extinction Rebellion protests, understand the urgency and want a government that will take action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat means going way beyond declaring a climate emergency and setting up a cabinet committee. It means listening to the scientists, decarbonising our economy, transforming our society and delivering a future that is sustainable, fair and just.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the other political parties will promise in their election leaflets. But I anticipate plenty of green-washing and empty promises.\n\nThat is not what you will hear from the Green Party. We\u2019ve been telling the truth about the climate crisis for years and we have a plan for how to tackle it.\n\nThis is what the election should be about, and this is why there has never been a more important time to vote Green.\n\nMORE: Boris Johnson wins vote for General Election on December 12\n\nMORE: Don\u2019t be fooled.
