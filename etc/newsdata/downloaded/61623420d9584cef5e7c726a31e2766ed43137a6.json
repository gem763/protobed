Cooking doesn\u2019t do anything to destroy it.\"\n\nDr Osterholm said that it took nearly 10 years to detect human transmissions of the so-called mad cow disease, otherwise known as the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n\nHe also noted that illness does not actually turn deer into \u201czombies,\u201d and the term \u201czombie deer\u201d is an inaccurate, non-scientific misnomer to describe the confounding disease.\n\nDr Osterholm said federal leadership would be crucial in order to curb the nationwide spread of the illness and officials have warned there is a lack of state resources when it comes to testing animal populations for chronic wasting disease.\n\nRead more\n\nOfficials caution against \u2018zombie snakes\u2019 that play dead\n\nPeregrine Wolff, a veterinarian with the Nevada Department of Wildlife, reportedly warned local politicians there was no stopping chronic wasting disease from inflicting damage to the state\u2019s deer populations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, it\u2019s a matter of when,\u201d she said during a public testimony over proposals to ban the import of certain animal body parts into the state, according to the Las Vegas Sun. \u201cWe know that we can\u2019t wrap Nevada in a bubble.\u201d\n\nThere have been no known human transmissions of the disease at this point, according to the CDC.\n\nBut officials said that the public can take steps to avoid coming in contact with and consuming contaminated meat.\n\n\u201cKnow the area you\u2019re hunting in,\u201d Dr Osterholm said.\n\nHe suggested that hunters should be made aware of any confirmed cases of chronic wasting disease in their regions.\n\nThey should also alert officials to sick animals who may appear to have the illness.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing you can do is get the animal tested,\u201d he said. And if there\u2019s any thought that an animal may have come in contact with the illness or is sick themselves, harvesting their meat should not even be considered.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Officials caution against \u2018zombie snakes\u2019 that play dead", "description": "Scientists have warned that \"zombie deer\" are spreading across America and there is nothing that can be done to stop them.Officials monitoring chronic wasting disease, a deadly and severely contagious neurological disorder, in nationwide deer populations, said the illness has now spread to", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RS_RZukV.awAEwkWNUJCPQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/543e4bcbe41db3b01896fce34fff8457", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
