It\u2019s the kind of thing a Hong Kong protestor might say after a clash with police.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protestors have their own argot. Cantonese, Hong Kong\u2019s lingua franca, is complicated enough with its nine tones. But even a native speaker might not understand a conversation between protestors, who have created between them a unique vocabulary.\n\nAlthough many would accuse them of making light of violent unrest, the use of slang \u201ckeeps people sane,\u201d argues Wee Lian Hee, a language professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cIf [protestors] talk formally all the time, I suspect the movement would soon become tiresome,\u201d he tells TIME.\n\nThe recent withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill, initially the trigger of the demonstrations, has done little to pacify public anger. Protestors continue to take to the streets, communicating in a jargon that reveals much about how they see each other, the authorities, and their actions.\n\n\u624b\u8db3 Sau Zuk (\u201cHands and Feet\u201d)\n\nProtestors refer to each other as \u201chands and feet.\u201d The term conveys the idea of unity: when the hands and feet of a protestor are injured, other protestors feel his or her pain.\n\n\u767c\u5922 Faht Moong (\u201cDreaming\u201d)\n\n\u201cI dreamed that I threw a petrol bomb last night,\u201d a protestor might say \u2014 except he wasn\u2019t actually dreaming. Many use the word to avoid directly stating that they were involved in unlawful activity.\n\nRiot police stand off against demonstrators inside New Town Plaza shopping mall, operated by Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., during a protest in the Shatin district of Hong Kong, China, on Sunday, July 14, 2019.

With clashes between police and protestors often occurring in busy retail districts that are home to glitzy malls, the \u201cshopping\u201d metaphor is oddly apt.\n\nVandalized turnstiles stand inside Tung Chung station, operated by MTR Corp,. during a protest in Hong Kong, China, on Sunday, Sept. 1, 2019. Paul Yeung/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\u9ee8\u9435 Daung Teet (\u201cCommunist Party Rail\u201d)\n\nEver since it started shuttering train stations closest to protest sites, the city\u2019s subway operator has been accused by protestors of siding with the police, who in turn are seen as an arm of the Beijing-backed government. Protesters have responded by vandalizing stations, destroying equipment such as ticket machines, and referring to the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) with this derogatory term, which rhymes with the actual name of the MTR in Cantonese.\n\n\u9b3c Gwai (\u201cGhost\u201d)\n\nUndercover cops are referred to by protestors as \u201cghosts.\u201d Young, black-clad and wearing face masks, these non-uniformed officers fit right in on the barricades before springing into action to make arrests. Two fired warning shots during violent clashes last week.\n\nProtesters hold umbrellas to protect themselves from police attack in Hong Kong on Aug. 31, 2019.

But most of the time, it\u2019s a shorthand way of saying \u201cEveryone open your umbrellas,\u201d often because police are about to use pepper spray.\n\n\u63a5\u653e\u5b78 Zeep Fong Hok (\u201cSchool Pick-up\u201d)\n\nWhen clashes between police and protestors last well into the night, long after train services have stopped, chat groups on encrypted messaging app Telegram start buzzing with information about \u201cschool pick-up\u201d services. Supporters of the protestors who have cars \u2014 or \u201cschool buses\u201d \u2014 let protesters know where to meet them, how many people they can pick up, and which districts they\u2019re able to drive to.\n\nDemonstrators seen during a protest action in front of a government building in the Central district of Hong Kong, on Aug. 18, 2019.

Proper gas masks \u2014 nicknamed for the snout-like shape of their filters \u2014 have become standard equipment.\n\n\u51fa\u9b54\u6cd5 Chut Morh Faht (\u201cUse Magic\u201d)\n\nTo \u201cuse magic\u201d means to start fires. Sadly, it\u2019s a term that has gained traction in recent weeks as hardline protestors become increasingly reckless in their actions, setting barricades and other objects ablaze.\n\n\u6dfa\u85cd/\u6df1\u85cd Cheen Laam or Sum Laam (\u201cLight Blue\u201d or \u201cDeep Blue\u201d)\n\nBlue is the unofficial color of supporters of the police and government (as opposed to yellow, which represents the pro-democracy camp). \u201cMy grandma is so deep blue,\u201d a protester might say. \u201cBut my dad is only light blue.\u201d\n\n\u2014With reporting by Aria Hangyu Chen / Hong Kong\n\nWrite to Hillary Leung at hillary.leung@time.com.", "description": "Hong Kong's protestors communicate in a jargon that reveals much about how they see each other, the authorities, and their actions.", "authors": ["Hillary Leung", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1165645768.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C601px%2C4246px%2C2223px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
