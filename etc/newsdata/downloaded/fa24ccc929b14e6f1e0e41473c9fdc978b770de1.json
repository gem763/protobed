Photo: Phaidon\n\nWhat\u2019s that you say? You want a new Rihanna album? Well, you\u2019ll have to settle for a book right now. The former musician (okay, she last released ANTI in January 2016) and current Fenty businesswoman announced a \u201cstunning visual autobiography,\u201d out this fall through Phaidon Press, called Rihanna. It\u2019s 504 pages with 1,050 pictures, 11 inserts, seven gatefolds and a poster, and much of the material has never been published before. (You know what else hasn\u2019t been published? That reggae album.) If that\u2019s not enough, there are three special editions: The Ultra Luxury Supreme edition comes with a marble pedestal and is already sold out, the Luxury Supreme edition includes a gold-plated tabletop stand and will set you back $5,500, and the Fenty x Phaidon edition (you know she had to) throws in a \u201cThis Shit Is Heavy\u201d stand for only $175. (Just want the 15-pound book? That\u2019s a steal at $150.) There will be 10 Ultra Luxury Supreme and 990 Luxury Supreme editions, both of which are signed by Rihanna and artists the Haas Brothers. Yet somehow, none of these deluxe editions comes with new music.\n\n\u201cI am so excited to share this collection of incredible images. I\u2019m very grateful to the talented photographers and artists who contributed. We\u2019ve been working on the book for over five years and I\u2019m really happy to be able to finally share it with everybody,\u201d Rihanna said in a press release. Which raises the question: How long have you been working on those damn albums? At least she won\u2019t keep us waiting on this for too long \u2014 the Fenty x Phaidon edition starts shipping this Thursday, October 10.", "description": "The \u201cvisual biography,\u201d titled Rihanna, will be a large-format book featuring over 1,000 pictures from the musician\u2019s career.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/07-rihanna-book-spread-square-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
