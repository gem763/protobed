They're both boring and lack instant gratification.\n\nAfter all, not everyone likes to spend hours on end, definitely not multiple days, to see people smacking cricket or golf balls with a bat or club. Definitely not remotely. Obviously, this is a big concern for the future of both sports.\n\nWe don't know how test cricket can be exciting, but just like Tour De France, golf is definitely working on some tech-inspired solutions, totally aware that the game needs more excitement from viewers perspective.\n\nReuters\n\nThe problem with golf is it happens at a leisurely pace, which can be boring compared to the fast action-packed bite of a soccer (football) or basketball, for instance. Younger generations aren't hooked into the game as much as the older fans, and this presents an existential threat to golf's future as a spectator sport. How's golf going to get over this extremely fundamental problem?\n\nDon't Miss 29.2 K SHARES 3.2 K SHARES 1.2 K SHARES 769 SHARES 732 SHARES\n\n\"It's a very valid point,\" agrees Mehul Kapadia, Global Head of Marketing, Tata Communications. \"Actually, I think that's one of the reasons why European Tour is also embracing this whole digital transformation journey with us so much.\"\n\nFor those who don't know, Tata Communications is in its second year of helping out the European Tour, trying to infuse it with technology to power enhanced viewing experiences for fans -- much like they do with Formula One for a long time now.\n\n\"As the European Tour, we deliver and support 48 tournaments in 31 countries worldwide. And that content is being generated and produced for up to 43 broadcasters, reaching out to over 500 million households worldwide,\" Michael Cole, CTO, PGA European Tour describes the role of content delivery that Tata Communications handles. \"And the the role that Tata communication plays in that is providing the global connectivity to ensure the content that is being produced in those 48 tournaments, and across those 31 countries, is being syndicated or distributed to those 43 broadcasters. So it's a critical role.\"\n\nReuters\n\nBoth Mehul Kapadia and Michael Cole agree that technology will play a key role in golf's revival and re-energizing as a spectator sport. But how exactly will this tech infusion take place?\n\n\"We are experimenting with e-sports, we've run proof of concept at the the Denmark event earlier this year,\" says Michael Cole, recognizing where technology can play a key role within the the tournament itself. He gave some examples of technology really driving up the pace of play at the BMW PGA championships in Wentworth earlier last month. \"And this is where we're incorporating a range of technologies from IoT, right through to connected course, and using several tracking capabilities to reconcile all the data in a very visual way to our referees and this allows our referees to proactively intervene where there are examples of slow play on the course.\"\n\nBut importantly, Michael reiterates, he wants that information to also be available to to the players, because they have a right to to understand where they are. \"Looking ahead, there is no reason why we couldn't provide that information for the media for broadcasters, for journalists, because it provides an additional story and additional narrative. But But equally for fans. It's another form of engagement that fans can tap into. And just add a little bit more immersion in terms of the game itself.\"\n\nAfter setting a benchmark of completing the world's first test of live 360\u00b0 video in 8K Ultra High Definition last year at the European Tour, showcasing how virtual reality could transform golf, the Tata Communications is working towards making golf an always connected sport, according to Mehul Kapadia. That's exactly why they decided to create the Innovation Hub platform.\n\nReuters\n\n\"So, one is to experiment and look at a few technology implementations like the 360\u00b0 video trials to come in,\" Mehul Kapadia, explains. \"But more importantly, how do we encourage the global talent to participate in golf's technology transformation? How do we tap into the startup community and imaginative, creative ideas? That's where the Innovation Hub comes in.\"\n\nApart from technology implementation, what are some of the other challenges preventing golf from being exciting? Mehul has some thoughts. \"One is that the sport itself is currently based in a way that it happens over four or five days with so many different players with so many different points of interest within it. So the challenge is how can we in a very smarter way, figure out those points of interest to make it more exciting.\"\n\n\"Irrespective of who the tech partner is, golf, cycling, and even Test cricket are very similar, as they happen over longer durations and seem very passive and not very active in terms of engagement. This is where even the sports governing body needs to think long and hard. Some are taking action as well. So we're very glad the European Tour is actually taking this kind of an initiative with us,\" Mehul concludes.\n\nMichael Cole largely echoes the same sentiments. \"We know that our premium fan base today is probably in 50 plus age bracket, that's where the history is, where people invest their time and their money into into our sport. But equally we know we that we need to reach out to new communities worldwide. And we need to reach out to the generations coming through, and the need to change our products.\"\n\nReuters\n\n\"As we evolve, our product will evolve, we will of course, maintain that traditional game of the 72 whole four day go tournament. But then we will bring new concepts into the schedule as well. So yeah, we recognize there are some key audiences and we're very keen to broaden that reach. And it all comes down to how we can use technology to change our conversation to extend that reach into new worldwide audiences, and really help the transformation of global golf,\" Michael sums up.", "description": "The game of golf is undergoing a technology-based transformation, through connected courses and IoT.
