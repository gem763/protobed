She received a routine epidural as she waited to deliver her son.\n\nNEWS ANCHOR DIAGNOSED WITH MOLAR PREGNANCY, UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY\n\nBut when her then-unborn child\u2019s blood pressure reportedly dropped to a dangerously low level, doctors prepped Mardsen for an emergency C-section, South West News Service (SWNS), a British news agency, reports.\n\n\u201cThey did multiple checks to make sure I was numb, with an ice-cold spray on several areas of my stomach, followed by jabbing me with a needle, and all was fine, I was numb,\u201d she recalled.\n\nBut that quickly changed following the incision. Moments later, Marsden said, \u201cI felt them actually pulling my stomach apart as they were ripping the muscles and I was in so much pain.\u201d\n\n\"The anesthetist was asking me if it was pain or pressure, and I was saying pain, but Matt said it was just like a whisper coming out of me,\u201d she added, referring to her husband. \"They could see I was uncomfortable, so they gave me more medication to try and get the pain under control but I was still in pain.\"\n\nMarsden\u2019s son Arthur was born shortly afterward. But the 27-year-old lost a lot of blood during the ordeal, she told SWNS, and was not able to hold her son until the following day when she was stable.\n\nReasons for epidural failure vary, but most often are a result of \"incorrect primary placement, secondary migration of a catheter after correct placement, and suboptimal dosing of local anesthetic drugs,\u201d according to a 2012 review by the British Journal of Anaesthesia. It\u2019s not clear what caused Marsden\u2019s epidural to fail.\n\nSTRESSED-OUT PREGNANT WOMEN MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A BABY OF A CERTAIN SEX, STUDY FINDS\n\n\"I love Arthur and am enjoying being a mom, but there's no way I'm going through that all ever again,\u201d she told SWNS. \"It was agony. I could feel the clamp inside me and the suction going around and I was really struggling to breathe.\"\n\n\"The whole experience was absolutely terrifying and I am totally traumatized from the birth,\u201d she added. \"It was like living in a nightmare, and I'm definitely not having any more children.\"", "description": "A British woman says her newborn son will be her first and last child after the epidural she received prior to his birth allegedly wore off during an emergency C-section.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
