You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFrom the appointment of a progressive Supreme Court justice to a president's fight against bigotry, here are 12 episodes doubling up as therapy for the Trump era.\n\nThe Supremes \u2013 season five, episode 17\n\nIn this episode, which originally aired in 2004, the Bartlet administration must find a suitable replacement for Supreme Court Associate Justice Owen Brady following his sudden death.\n\nDeputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman suggests Evelyn Baker Lang (Glenn Close), a judge initially deemed too liberal to be confirmed.\n\n\"The conservative anchor of the Court has just died, a young, brilliant thinker, who brought the right out of the closet and championed a whole conservative revival,\" Lang herself says at one point.\n\n\"You cannot replace Owen Brady with a woman who overturned a parental consent law, you'd be shishkababed and set aflame on the South Lawn. Two reporters, three reporters have walked by since we started. I'm window dressing, that's fine. I'm happy to help, but let's just chat about the weather.\"\n\nThe situation closely echoes the controversy over the replacement of Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016.\n\nBarack Obama picked Merrick Garland, a moderate liberal, to replace him, but Senate Republicans refused to consider his nomination.\n\nNeil Gorsuch, a conservative, was nominated by a newly elected Donald Trump in January 2017 and confirmed in April of that year.\n\nIn The Supremes, Lang eventually makes it to the Supreme Court, not as associate justice, but as its first female chief justice.\n\nThe Midterms \u2013 season two, episode three\n\nBack in 2000, The Midterms featured an iconic sequence in which President Bartlet publicly confronts a religious fundamentalist radio host over her bigotry.\n\nAs he gives an address related to the ongoing midterm elections, Bartlet, himself a devout Catholic, spots Dr Jenna Jacobs in the crowd.\n\nThe president publicly confronts her about homophobic statements Jacobs has made on her show, in which she has called homosexuality an \"abomination\".\n\nWhen Jacobs argues that the assertion came from the Bible, Bartlet makes several specific references to the scriptures to highlight the many ways in which most people take liberties from them on a daily basis.\n\n\"While you may be mistaking this for your monthly meeting of the ignorant tight-a** club, in this building when the president stands, nobody sits,\" he says at the end of his tirade, which exemplifies how those in position of power can take a stand against discrimination.\n\nLet Bartlet be Bartlet \u2013 season one, episode 19\n\nIn a plot line that will sound reminiscent of many present-day headlines, a scathing internal memo in which a White House insider criticises the president is leaked.\n\nThe press gives the document, which paints Bartlet as too shy to make bold decisions, ample coverage, putting the administration in a difficult position.\n\nBartlet and his staff eventually realise that the president has too often ignored his principles to play politics, meaning his administration now appears inefficient.\n\nChief of Staff Leo McGarry eventually comes up with the catchphrase \"Let Bartlet be Bartlet\", a motto that captures the need for the president to stand up for what he thinks he's right.\n\nThe team then resolves to elevate the public debate and stick to their positions, even if it costs Bartlet re-election.\n\nBartlet for America \u2013 season three, episode nine\n\nFlashback sequences reveal how Bartlet, then governor of New Hampshire, came to run for president.\n\nMcGarry, his best friend and future chief of staff, is the one who comes up with the slogan \"Bartlet for America\" and writes it down on a napkin.\n\nThe episode also deals with Bartlet's multiple sclerosis diagnosis, and whether it was sufficiently disclosed at the time of his run.\n\nAs such, it sheds light on how a political campaign can continue to affect a presidency well after Election Day, in addition to offering one possible answer to the question: \"Exactly how does one decide to run for one of the most powerful political offices in the world?\"\n\nIn Excelsis Deo \u2013 season one, episode 10\n\nThis Emmy-winning Christmas episode, which earned Aaron Sorkin and Rick Cleveland the Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series gong, tackles serious matters \u2013 as is customary in The West Wing \u2013 yet has a distinct feel-good tone.\n\nIt brought awareness to the issue of homeless war veterans, through a story line in which a Korean War vet is found, having frozen to death on a bench.\n\nWhite House Communications Director Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff, who won an Emmy for his portrayal of Ziegler), pulls strings to organise a military funeral for the former Marine at Arlington National Cemetery. Bartlet only lightly reprimands Ziegler when the communications director admits to using White House resources to set up the burial.\n\nMrs. Landingham, Bartlet's presidential secretary, decides to attend the event. In a moving scene, she reveals her twin boys were drafted for the Vietnam War while in medical school and died within four months on Christmas Eve 1970. This is the first big reveal concerning Mrs. Landingham's backstory, and it's a tragic one. Coupled with Ziegler's efforts to give the late veteran a proper send-off, the episode reads at many times like a lesson in empathy.\n\nGame on \u2013 season four, episode six\n\nIn a now iconic sequence, Bartlet, who is debating his Republican opponent Robert Ritchie, challenges the idea that political campaigns should fit into neat sound bites.\n\nAfter Ritchie delivers a 10-word answer describing why he thinks tax cuts are warranted, Bartlet urges him to describe just as succinctly how he plans to accomplish that.\n\n\"Give me the next 10 words, how are we going to do it? Give me 10 after that, I'll drop out of the race right now,\" he says.\n\n\"Every once in a while, every once in a while, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those days almost always include body counts.\n\n\"Other than that there aren't very many un-nuanced moments in leading a country that's way too big for 10 words.\"\n\nBartlet's tirade is a testament to the complexity of politics, and a rallying cry against populism.\n\nThe fictional debate is also a throwback to a time where political opponents didn't hurl demeaning nicknames at each other (see Trump's \"Little Marco\" aimed at Florida Senator Marco Rubio), nor did they step away from their lectern to loom behind their competitor (as Trump did during his second debate against Hillary Clinton).\n\nShutdown \u2013 season five, episode eight\n\nBartlet locks horns with Speaker of the House Jeff Haffley when the latter unexpectedly challenges previously agreed-upon cuts to government funding.\n\nThe disagreement leads to a government shutdown and leaves an uncompromising Bartlet sticking to his position until the other side caves.\n\nWhile it aired for the first time in 2003, this episode still feels educational 15 years later \u2013 especially at a time when the White House has threatened a possible government shutdown if he doesn't get funding for his border wall.\n\n2162 votes \u2013 season six, episode 22\n\nSet during the Democratic National Convention, this episode sees Bartlet's party scramble to pick its presidential candidate.\n\nWhen the possibility of using one candidate's wife's depression against him, Matt Santos refuses, instead giving a rousing speech reminding the audience that \"we're all broken\".\n\n\"Don't vote for us because you think we're perfect,\" he urges the crowd.\n\n\"Don't vote for us because of what we might be able to do for you only.\n\n\"Vote for the person who shares your ideals, your hopes, your dreams.\"\n\nThe episode serves as an educational deep dive in the uncompromising world of political campaigns, and is also another vehicle for the show's signature mix of politics, ethics, and emotion.\n\n20 Hours in America \u2013 season four, episodes one and two\n\nWhile President Bartlet gives a speech in Indiana, Communications Director Ziegler and Deputy Chief of Staff Lyman chat with Cathy, a farmer played by Amy Adams.\n\nZiegler and Lyman end up missing the motorcade, along with Lyman's senior assistant Donna Moss.\n\nThe three are thus left to try to return home, and in the process, learn more about rural Indiana and its culture \u2013 in a two-part instalment that shows just how refreshing it can be to see politicians trying to survive far away from the confines of Capitol Hill.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 25 best TV shows on Netflix UK 1/25 Bojack Horseman A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development\u2026 on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams \u201cmust watch\u201d. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack \u2013 one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin\u2019 Around \u2013 as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. Almost as good are a support cast including Alison Brie (Glow, Mad Men), Aaron Paul, of Breaking Bad, and Amy Sedaris as a pampered Persian cat who is also BoJack\u2019s agent. Season five touches the live rail of harassment in the movie industry, offering one of the most astute commentaries yet on the #MeToo movement with an episode based centred around an awards ceremony called \u201cThe Forgivies\u201d. Netflix 2/25 Stranger Things A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb \u2013 the \u201cbest friend\u201d character eaten in the second episode \u2013 went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix 3/25 Daredevil Netflix\u2019s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox\u2019s blind lawyer/crimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck's turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D'Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Netflix 4/25 The Staircase Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson \u2013 charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife \u2013 the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It\u2019s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Netflix 5/25 Dark Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix\u2019s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it\u2019s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it\u2019s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. Netflix 6/25 A Series of Unfortunate Events The wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let\u2019s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). Netflix 7/25 Maniac If you\u2019re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It\u2019s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a \u201ctravel buddy\u201d sit down and read you adverts. Stone and Hill are star-crossed outcasts participating in a drugs trial that catapults them into a series of trippy genre excursions \u2013 including an occult adventure and a Lord of the Rings-style fantasy. It is here that Fukunaga demonstrates his versatility, handling potentially hokey material smartly and respectfully. 007 fans can sleep easy. Netflix 8/25 Better Call Saul The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord\u2019s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? AMC Studios/Netflix 9/25 Black Mirror Don\u2019t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker\u2019s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash \u2013 yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story \"San Junipero\" and Star Trek parody \"USS Callister\", which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. Netflix 10/25 Mindhunter David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It\u2019s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders \u2013 including the notorious \u201cCo-Ed\u201d butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. Netflix 11/25 The Crown A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost / Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. Most impressive of all, arguably, is Claire Foy, who plays the Queen as a shy woman thrust unwillingly into the spotlight. Foy and the rest of the principal cast have now departed, with a crew of older actors \u2013 headed by Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies \u2013 taking over as the middle-aged Windsors for season three. Netflix 12/25 Narcos This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino\u2019s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix\u2019s biggest hits \u2013 the company doesn\u2019t release audience figures \u2013 the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico\u2019s interminable drugs wars. Juan Pablo Gutierrez/Netflix 13/25 Master Of None A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari\u2019s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. K.C. Bailey / Netflix 14/25 Bloodline One of Netflix\u2019s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan\u2019s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling \u2013 a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn\u2019t feel all that guilty about. Rod Millington/Netflix 15/25 The Alienist You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We\u2019re firmly in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Br\u00fchl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Kurt Iswarienko 16/25 Love Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs\u2019s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms \u2013 but Love\u2019s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there\u2019s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Netflix 17/25 Queer Eye Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs \u2013 but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. Netflix 18/25 Chef\u2019s Table A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef; across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. Charles Panian/Netflix 19/25 Arrested Development A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman \u201cmansplained\u201d away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix\u2019s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix 20/25 Altered Carbon Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new \u201cskins\u201d. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix\u2019s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel\u2019s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs. Netflix 21/25 Rick and Morty Dan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFly/Doc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon. Netflix/Adult Swim 22/25 GLOW Mad Men\u2019s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda \u201cBritannica\u201d Richardson. Netflix 23/25 Archer Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings. 24/25 Ozark Breaking Bad for those with short attention spans. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero\u2019s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family. Netflix 25/25 The Good Place A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto). Netflix 1/25 Bojack Horseman A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development\u2026 on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams \u201cmust watch\u201d. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack \u2013 one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin\u2019 Around \u2013 as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. Almost as good are a support cast including Alison Brie (Glow, Mad Men), Aaron Paul, of Breaking Bad, and Amy Sedaris as a pampered Persian cat who is also BoJack\u2019s agent.

Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs\u2019s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms \u2013 but Love\u2019s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there\u2019s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Netflix 17/25 Queer Eye Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs \u2013 but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. Netflix 18/25 Chef\u2019s Table A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef; across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. Charles Panian/Netflix 19/25 Arrested Development A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman \u201cmansplained\u201d away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix\u2019s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix 20/25 Altered Carbon Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new \u201cskins\u201d. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix\u2019s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel\u2019s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs. Netflix 21/25 Rick and Morty Dan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFly/Doc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon. Netflix/Adult Swim 22/25 GLOW Mad Men\u2019s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda \u201cBritannica\u201d Richardson. Netflix 23/25 Archer Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings. 24/25 Ozark Breaking Bad for those with short attention spans. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero\u2019s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family. Netflix 25/25 The Good Place A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto). Netflix\n\nIsaac and Ishmael \u2013 season three, episode one\n\nThis episode, which originally aired in October 2001, was an early response to the 9/11 attacks by a work of fiction, occurring less than a month after the fact.\n\nWhile Lyman and Moss visit a high school, the White House goes on lock-down.\n\nStudents then ask the duo pointed questions related to religion, anti-American sentiment, and terrorism.\n\nLyman takes a firm stance against prejudice, and instead prompts the group to reflect further on the topics.\n\n\"Islamic extremist is to Islamic as 'blank' is to Christianity,\" he says, asking the students to complete the sentence.\n\nHe then reveals that \"blank\" stands for \"KKK\" before launching into an explainer about \"Islamic extremism\".\n\nIsaac and Ishmael, which came together over the course of just two weeks, has been criticised for being preachy and lacking a sophisticated plot, but many still remember the sequence as striking.\n\n\"The episode wasn\u2019t great, but it was a noble experiment, and despite itself, made some pretty salient points,\" the AV Club noted.\n\nAnd It's Surely to Their Credit \u2013 season two, episode five\n\nWhen Bartlet hires Ainsley Hayes, a conservative commentator, as a legal counsel, his staff initially recoils.\n\nSeeing Hayes carve herself a spot in Bartlet's progressive White House is an interesting exploration of bipartisanship on the small screen.\n\nWhile Hayes was a controversial character, both in the show and in some viewers' minds, her story line remains a valuable study of what happens when leaders reach across party lines.\n\nThe US Poet Laureate \u2013 season three, episode 17\n\nBartlet is caught making a disparaging comment about the potential Republican nominee.\n\nThe \u2013 rather eloquent \u2013 gaffe, during which Bartlet calls his opponent a \".22 caliber mind in a .357 magnum world\" is deemed so outrageous, however, that it sends the president's staff in a frenzy to spin the incident in his favour.\n\nOne of their concerns is to retain the approval of his supporters, who could presumably be so shocked by Bartlet's choice of words they would turn his back on him \u2013 in a story line that seems almost endearing at a time when insults have become a routine part of the White House discourse.\n\nCelebrate the 20th Anniversary of The West Wing with The West Wing: The Complete Series Collection available at the WB shop", "description": "Twenty years have passed\u00a0since the first episode of\u00a0The West Wing\u00a0aired, but some chapters of\u00a0Josiah Bartlet's presidency seem more relevant than ever. The show, which ran from 1999 to 2006,\u00a0offered a refreshing portrayal of Capitol Hill by\u00a0infusing\u00a0a strong sense of morality and righteousness into\u00a0the gritty world of DC politics.", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mence Michallon"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/19/21/gettyimages-1309919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
