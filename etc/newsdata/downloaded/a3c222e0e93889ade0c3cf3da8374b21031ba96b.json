With so many candidates on stage and so many issues to discuss, it should be a wild evening.\n\nUnfortunately, the crowded stage will leave a lot to be desired. With 12 candidates on stage, a conversation likely focused on impeachment may eat up a lot of time.\n\nAside from impeachment, Sanders\u2019 health will certainly prompt a discussion about his fitness for office and that of the other two 70-something candidates, Sen.

There is likely to be a discussion of health care, which is a pressing issue and the defining issue in the presidential contest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese are important issues, but there is a danger that there will be little opportunity for the Democratic candidates to discuss the other issues that concern many Americans. There won\u2019t be much time left to discuss the looming recession, foreign policy, gun violence and climate change \u2014 all of which demand the attention of the White House hopefuls.\n\nThere has been some discussion of gun violence and climate change in the Democratic debates but there has been little discussion so far about two key problems: the looming recession and national security.\n\nIt\u2019s still the economy, stupid.\n\nMost economists believe that the nation is at the end of a business cycle of economic growth that began with the Obama-era recovery after the Wall Street crash of 2008. In a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll three of every five Americans (60 percent) said they believed the nation was heading into a recession.\n\n\u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the Green New Deal could both be economic engines down the road. But the candidates have not discussed the actions that will be necessary to help Americans cope with the effects of the looming recession. Americans won\u2019t be patient when the recession arrives. So, the Democratic aspirants should be clear on their plans for a quick remedy for the economic downturn,\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAction to deal with the painful effects of a recession could lay the foundation for more comprehensive initiatives to deal with big national problems.\n\nA big investment in infrastructure would stimulate the economy and provide a foundation for fighting climate change. A reversal of the tax cuts for big business in favor of working families would put money in the pockets of Americans and eventually provide the basis for the funding for Medicare for All or an extension of ObamaCare.\n\nThe other neglected problem is national security.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been much discussion of foreign policy so far in the Democratic race, which is unfortunate since the next president will spend most of his or her time dealing with the aftermath of President Trump Donald John TrumpWHCA calls on Trump to denounce video depicting him shooting media outlets Video of fake Trump shooting members of media shown at his Miami resort: report Trump hits Fox News's Chris Wallace over Ukraine coverage MORE\u2019s inept handling of our relationship with the rest of the world, especially his betrayal of America\u2019s allies.\n\nSo many issues, so many candidates and so little time.\n\nThe problem is all these problems deserve discussion but there have been too many Democrats on the debate stages to do the issues justice. The Democratic presidential debates won\u2019t become manageable until there are fewer candidates participating. It\u2019s impossible to have a serious discussion about vital issues when the candidates have only ninety seconds to answer questions.\n\nBut sadly, that won\u2019t happen soon. Eight Democratic contenders have already qualified for the fifth round on Nov. 20 even though the Democratic National Committee stiffened the requirements for participation.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has already taken a lot of flak for winnowing the field down from two dozen candidates to 12. One candidate, Rep.
