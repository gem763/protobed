These first light images show that we can do exactly that, but we can go a lot further.\u201d\n\nHOW TO SPOT A WORMHOLE\n\nAccording to the MPE, each telescope is equipped with state-of-the-art CCD cameras with superb spectral and timing resolution. \u201cThe potential for new discoveries is immense. Now we can start reaping the fruits of more than 10 years of work,\u201d added Predehl.\n\nAnother eROSITA image of the A3391/3395 system of clusters of galaxies shows the different processes that lead to the formation of so-called gigantic structures in the universe, according to scientists.\n\nThe clusters, which look like large nebulae in the images, actually span tens of millions of light-years across, and contain thousands of galaxies each.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cX-rays give us a unique view of the Universe, hidden in visible light,\u201d said Kirpal Nandra, director of high-energy astrophysics at MPE. \u201cLooking at an apparently normal star, in X-rays we might see an orbiting white dwarf or neutron star in the process of devouring its companion. Visible light shows the structure of a galaxy traced by its stars, but the X-rays are dominated by supermassive black holes growing at their centers.\"\n\nNandra continued: \"And where we see clusters of galaxies with optical telescopes, X-rays reveal the huge reservoirs of gas filling the space between them and tracing out the dark matter structure of the Universe. With its performance demonstrated, we now know that eROSITA will lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the evolution of the energetic Universe.\"\n\nThe eROSITA was launched on July 13 as part of the Russian-German Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space mission and has now entered its target orbit 100 days after launch.", "description": "The first amazing images from a dark energy-hunting telescope have been revealed.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/erosita-telescope.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
