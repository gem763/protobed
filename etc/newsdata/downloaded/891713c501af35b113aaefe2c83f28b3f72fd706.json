The only other MP forced to undergo a reselection vote - in which the incumbent has an automatic right to a place on the ballot paper alongside rival candidates \u2013 has been Diana Johnson in Hull North, where the antisemitism row was not an issue.\n\nSeveral MPs have complained that the process has taken campaigning resources away from the battle against Conservatives over a crucial pre-election summer.\n\nDame Margaret said she would fight to win the majority she needs in a ballot of all local members in order to stay on as candidate in the election which could come within weeks.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

She has been the target of vicious smears, derision and antisemitism because she has been resolute in her opposition to anti-Jewish racism.\n\n\u201cThis takes place at the same time that the party are being investigated for unlawful discrimination by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission.\n\n\u201cThis could not have happened without the toxic atmosphere and culture of denialism that has gripped the party. Engineered by the party\u2019s leadership, it has been enforced by a sordid coalition of fake news, factionalism and the frontbench.\n\n\u201cMargaret is a doughty fighter, and JLM will be right alongside her over the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nA Labour Party spokesperson said: \u201cUnder longstanding party rules, reselection processes have to be held in between general elections. This has happened before every general election since 2001, apart from the 2017 snap election.\n\n\u201cThese are taking place in every Labour-held constituency across the country and in any reselection sitting MPs are automatically on the ballot paper.\u201d", "description": "One of Labour\u2019s most prominent Jewish MPs is facing a fight for her political career after activists in her local party voted to trigger a reselection ballot.
