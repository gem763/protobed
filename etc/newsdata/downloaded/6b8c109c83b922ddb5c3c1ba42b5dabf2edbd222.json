He also lambasted members for believing that race was irrelevant in discussions about inequality and poverty.\n\nREAD IN FULL | Herman Mashaba: I cannot reconcile myself with people who believe race is irrelevant\n\n\"I cannot reconcile myself with people who do not see that South Africa is more unequal today than it was in 1994,\" Mashaba said in his resignation speech.\n\nHe will only leave office on November 27, to allow the party to find a replacement, he told the media.\n\nMaimane praised Mashaba for his efforts in the City and added that he considered Mashaba a comrade and \"hero\".\n\nGrip on power in the balance\n\nIn a press statement shortly after his announcement, DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi said Mashaba's resignation did not signal an end to the party's commitment to the people of Johannesburg.\n\nThe DA's grip on power in the metro hangs in the balance with its coalition partner, the IFP, understood to be in discussions with the ANC about a possible partnership.\n\nThe party will also struggle to convince the EFF to maintain their partnership, albeit a tenuous one, as the red berets and their leader, Julius Malema, view Mashaba in a favourable light.\n\nALSO READ: Outgoing Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba is a 'friend and hero' - DA leader Mmusi Maimane\n\nThe partnership between the EFF and the DA in Johannesburg has experienced the fewest hiccups as the parties have jostled for power.\n\nIn Nelson Mandela Bay, the EFF was instrumental in removing Athol Trollip as mayor and in Tshwane, former mayor Solly Msimanga struggled to get the backing of the freedom fighters on several votes.\n\nMalatsi said the federal executive, which is in charge of the day-to-day workings of the party, would meet soon to assess the impact of Mashaba's announcement.\n\nTheir discussions may also take into consideration the panel review, chaired by former leader Tony Leon, which found that entering into a partnership with the EFF after the 2016 municipal elections was a \"mistake\".\n\nProgressives vs pure liberals\n\nMashaba's resignation follows a federal council meeting in which the so-called pure liberals regained their power position from the progressives, through Helen Zille's election as federal council chairperson.\n\nMaimane favoured Trollip for the position.\n\nFire from the pure liberals was stoked after the DA lost a strong cross-section of voters to the Freedom Front Plus in May's general elections.\n\nThe progressive liberals \u2013 represented by Maimane \u2013 have publicly stated their view that the party needs to diversify and broaden its policies to appeal to more black voters.\n\nNaming DA successes during Mashaba's tenure, Malatsi said 1 500 metro police officers have been recruited to assist in the fight against crime, and investment in Johannesburg's inner city had increased from R5bn to R16.355bn to build affordable residential units and student accommodation.\n\nHe added that the City's preliminary reports demonstrated that at the end of the 2018/19 year, it was in a stronger financial position with a closing cash balance of R4.4bn.\n\n\"The South African Democratic Project is not an easy one to advance, which means building a capable state, fighting for non-racialism, pushing for economic redress and inclusion through sustainable programmes, respect for the rule of law. We will not falter in our mission to bring real change to South Africa We would like to thank Mr Mashaba for his service to the people of Johannesburg and the DA,\" Malatsi said.", "description": "The Democratic Alliance will convene an urgent federal executive meeting after the announcement that Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba was resigning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7961/8bf47d4947794c81a915ef8b008bed98.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
