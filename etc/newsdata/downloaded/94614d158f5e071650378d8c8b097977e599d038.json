The decision, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, comes in response to Cuba's support for Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and aims to ensure that the Cuban government cannot profit from U.S. travel.\n\nIn a tweet, Pompeo said he asked Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao to suspend air service so Cuba cannot profit from U.S. air travel and use the revenues to \"repress the Cuban people.\"\n\nToday, I asked @SecElaineChao to suspend scheduled air service between the U.S. and all Cuban airports, except Havana\u2019s Jose Mart\u00ed Airport. This action will prevent the Castro regime from profiting from U.S. air travel and using the revenues to repress the #Cuban people. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) October 25, 2019\n\nAccording to a notice published by the Department of Transportation, the policy was created at the Department of State's request. On October 25, Pompeo wrote to Chao that banning travel to the majority of Cuba will \"strengthen the economic consequences to the Cuban regime.\"\n\n\"To further the Administration's policy of strengthening the economic consequences to the Cuban regime for its ongoing repression of the Cuban people and its support for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela, in the foreign policy interests of the United States, I respectfully request that the Department of Transportation suspend until further notice all scheduled U.S. carrier flights between the United States and all airports in Cuba, except Jose\u0301 Marti\u0301 International Airport (HAV) in Havana,\" the letter states.\n\n\"Suspending flights to these nine airports sends a clear message to the Cuban government that the United States is taking firm action in response to the regime's ongoing repression of its people and support for Maduro. Maintaining flights to Jose\u0301 Marti\u0301 International Airport preserves the main getaway for travel from the United States to Cuba on commercial flights for family visitation or other lawful purposes.\"\n\nCuban president Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel has repeatedly shown his support for Maduro, whose self-imposed rule of the country has led to significant political and economic distress in Venezuela since 2017. Raul Castro, although no longer the leader of Cuba, is still the head of the country's Communist Party and has also spoken in support of Maduro.\n\nAirlines, including JetBlue and American Airlines, will have a 45-day grace period to finish out service to Cuban destinations.\n\nJetBlue said they plan to operate in \"full compliance\" with the policy and are still trying to understand the extent of the change.\n\n\"Due to an updated U.S. policy regarding travel to Cuba, JetBlue will no longer operate to and from Camag\u00fcey, Holgu\u00edn, and Santa Clara as of December 10, 2019,\" the airline posted on their website. They added that customers who already booked travel to those destinations for on or after December 10 will be offered a refund or full credit. They can also rebook their flights for service to Havana.\n\nAmerican Airlines said they are still reviewing the policy and will \"comply with federal law, work with the administration and update our policies and procedures\" regarding service to Cuba.\n\nCuba's foreign affairs minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla tweeted that he rejects the ban, but that Cuba will overcome the restrictions.\n\n\"I strongly reject new #US blockade measure that bans #US airlines' flights to 9 Cuban airports; strengthens US citizens' travel ban; mutilates US people liberties & damages people- to-people contacts. But they won't extract any concession from us. We shall overcome!\" he wrote.\n\nI strongly reject new #US blockade measure that bans #US airlines' flights to 9 Cuban airports; strengthens US citizens' travel ban; mutilates US people liberties & damages people- to-people contacts.
