They have access to a gym, a library and a TV room, the Tasc spokesman said.\n\nHe said Huffman intends to read, walk in the courtyard and exercise as much as she can.\n\nHuffman was one of 51 people charged in the scandal. She paid $15,000 to boost her older daughter\u2019s SAT scores with the help of William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, an admission consultant at the center of the scheme. Singer, who has pleaded guilty, was accused of bribing a test proctor to correct the teenager\u2019s answer.\n\nThe scandal was the biggest college admissions case ever prosecuted by the justice department.\n\nProsecutors said parents schemed to manipulate test scores and bribed coaches to get their children into schools by having them labeled as recruited athletes for sports they didn\u2019t play.", "description": "Actor was also sentenced to a $30,000 fine, 250 hours of community service and a year\u2019s probation after pleading guilty", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36074ef11ffae8a8e3570cf73c38bf785b36cfc8/0_53_2887_1732/master/2887.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f2c705fd48488752e1533f4163a9c838", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
