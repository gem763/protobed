Stocks were lower across Asia and Europe, but the dollar recovered earlier losses.\n\nHere is how people around the world assessed the latest U.S. political shootout, which Trump derided as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201charassment\u201d by House Democrats:\n\nChina\n\nImpeachment proceedings are likely to take a long time, so they will have very little impact, if any, on the trade talks with China, said Yao Xinchao, a professor of trade at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe odds of Trump getting impeached by the end of 2019 are very slim,\u201d Yao said. \u201cOf course, Trump getting reelected would further dim the prospects for China-U. S. relations. It would reinforce his conviction that taking a hard line against China pays off, and allow him to cast off his already few misgivings in making irresponsible decisions.\u201d\n\nStill, Beijing wants a swift end to the trade war and would not like a prolonged period of uncertainty, he said.\n\nBut China would welcome any effort to oust Trump, said Wu Qiang, a political scientist who was forced to resign from Tsinghua University because of his critical writings.\n\n\u201cXi wants Trump out and has been trying to achieve that through a lot of propaganda, string-pulling and even secret political intervention,\u201d Wu said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping and to frustration over the trade dispute.\n\n\u201cThat said, I don\u2019t think a Democratic president or other alternatives would bring radical changes to Washington\u2019s China policy. The wind has turned against Beijing and will stay that way for much longer,\u201d Wu added.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined to respond to the impeachment news, telling reporters that it was \u201can internal matter for the United States.\u201d\n\nLyric Li in Beijing.\n\nGermany and France\n\nAfter more than two years, many continental Europeans have grown weary of talk of impeaching Trump, even if they may support it.\n\nDespite the risks for the Democrats and the challenges any impeachment move would face in the Senate, the conservative newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung argued that the decision to announce an inquiry was necessary. \u201cWhat would it mean for democracy if a majority in the House of Representatives refrained from even trying to take action?\u201d the paper\u2019s former U.S. correspondent, Andreas Ross, wrote.\n\nThere was widespread skepticism over the likelihood of success of an impeachment inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly too early for farewells,\u201d the German magazine Der Spiegel commented on its website.\n\nIn France, the tone of coverage mostly played up the uncertainty of the proceedings at this early stage, too. \u201cThe United States is engaged in the unknown,\u201d the prominent French daily Le Monde wrote in the lead of its story on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn continental Europe, few would miss Trump as president. \u201cAll parties apart from the [far-right] AfD party would be jolly glad if the Trump presidency was over,\u201d said Stephan Bierling, an international politics professor at the University of Regensburg in Germany in an email. \u201cThe faster, the better.\u201d\n\nBut Bierling also acknowledged that some of the reasons for continental Europe\u2019s welcoming stance toward possible impeachment proceedings were debatable. Some of Trump\u2019s criticism of Europe \u2014 including his attacks on Germany over its low defense spending \u2014 has been backed by analysts. German leaders may hope that post-Trump, it might become easier again for them to \u201cduck again,\u201d Bierling said.\n\nRick Noack in Berlin and James McAuley in Paris.\n\nBritain\n\nIn Britain, the announcement of an impeachment inquiry was largely overshadowed by the historic ruling of the United Kingdom\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of Parliament was unlawful.\n\n\u201c[Many] people see so many parallels between Trump and Johnson as populist, would-be strongmen who flout the rules and seem to get away with it \u2014 at least until now,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, in an email.\n\n\u201cOften these days, there\u2019s a huge Brexit news story in the morning, and then a huge story on Trump in the afternoon,\u201d said Jacob Parakilas, an associate at LSE Ideas, a foreign policy think tank.\n\nWith the impeachment inquiry announcement, there is now a possibility of both stories colliding.\n\nTrump has been one of the most vocal foreign advocates of Brexit, and his assurances that Britain would be able to speedily negotiate a trade deal with the United States were especially welcomed by hard-line Brexiteers. As Britain continues to face the possibility of a no-deal Brexit with severe negative economic repercussions, such a trade deal would be crucial.\n\nBut analysts doubted how much sway Trump ever had over future negotiations \u2014 and whether impeachment would matter in this context.\n\n\u201cGiven the scale of the challenges facing British policymakers at this point, I'm not convinced that the impeachment articles that will be considered by the Judiciary Committee are actually going to make an enormous difference on this side,\u201d said Ursula Hackett, a politics researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London.\n\nParakilas added that impeachment proceedings would make it even less likely for Congress to approve a trade deal with Britain, but lawmakers\u2019 support was unlikely even prior to Tuesday\u2019s announcement.\n\nRick Noack.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nIn this U.S.-allied East Asian country, experts said that domestic pressure on Trump might spur him to seek a quick resolution on North Korea, whose leader Kim Jong Un the U.S. president has repeatedly praised. Trump said recently he might meet Kim again soon, while South Korea has said that talks between the two sides might resume in two to three weeks.\n\n\u201cHis engagement with North Korea has produced achievements that are highly visible. He could turn to a diplomatic event with North Korea to divert attention away from domestic political challenges,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.\n\nYang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, noted, though, that impeachment proceedings could have the opposite effect and push Trump to become more bellicose toward Kim. He noted that the failed February summit with the North Korean leader in Hanoi, where Trump walked away, occurred around the same time as his former lawyer Michael Cohen testified to a House committee.\n\n\u201cIf the impeachment risk becomes a real threat for Trump, he could again walk out of a summit meeting with Kim Jong Un, to send a message to people at home,\u201d Yang said.\n\nMin Joo Kim in Seoul.\n\nIndia\n\nFor India, the announcement of the impeachment proceedings came at a slightly awkward moment. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a week-long visit to the United States and appeared with Trump at a rousing rally Sunday in Houston, where the two men clasped hands and traded effusive compliments.\n\nOn Tuesday, just before the news broke that the House would begin impeachment proceedings, Trump was sitting down for a bilateral meeting with Modi in New York. But experts said the impeachment process was unlikely to raise eyebrows or concerns in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cThere is very little appreciation in India of the internal dynamics of U.S. politics, just as people in the U.S. don\u2019t appreciate India\u2019s internal politics,\u201d said Varghese George, the author of a new book on U.S.-India relations under Modi and Trump.\n\nGiven that a sizable proportion of Indian members of Parliament have faced criminal charges, the political class is hard to shock.\n\n\u201cMuch greater skulduggery takes place here,\u201d said Manoj Joshi, an expert on international relations at the Observer Research Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi. The Indian government won\u2019t \u201cbe bothered about it at all.\u201d\n\nJoanna Slater in New Delhi.\n\nHouse launches Trump impeachment inquiry, setting up political clash\n\nTrump and House Democrats are \u2018crossing the Rubicon\u2019 with impeachment showdown\n\nTrump campaign ramps up fundraising in response to impeachment inquiry\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Pressure on the president at home may force him to seek a quick foreign-policy achievement, some say.
