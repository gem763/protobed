Jonkers said she almost lost consciousness when Williams allegedly tried to strangle her with it, but Gopie intervened.\n\nWilliams allegedly took the dog faeces that she had brought with her, threw it on the ground and made Van Niekerk eat it again.\n\nVan Niekerk had also been hit with a knobkierie.\n\nJudgment in Williams' bail application is expected on Monday.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
