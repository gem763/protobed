He spoke highly of his U.S. pupil this week after Pulisic performed well as a sub against both Newcastle (league match) and Ajax, assisting on the lone goal in the UEFA Champions League away game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal\u201d to wait for an opportunity, he said. \u201cI wanted to make an impact, and it\u2019s not going to happen right away. I had to prove myself and continue to work. I\u2019m happy to go out and help the team today.\u201d\n\nThe only other U.S. national team player to record a Premier League hat trick was Clint Dempsey for Fulham in January 2012 against Newcastle. Dempsey also posted a hat trick in the FA Cup.\n\nAD\n\nPulisic is, by far, the youngest American to score twice in England\u2019s top tier. He is also the youngest three-goal scorer in a Premier League match in Chelsea history.\n\nAD\n\nThe Blues have won four straight in league play (6-2-2 overall) and seven straight in all competitions.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pulisic and Chelsea will host Manchester United in the League Cup. His next U.S. appearance is expected to come Nov. 15 against Canada in a Concacaf Nations League match in Orlando.\n\nLet us breakdown those two Christian Pulisic goals for ya pic.twitter.com/gfSiXza3OL \u2014 NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) October 26, 2019\n\nPULISIC HATTRICK AHHHHH pic.twitter.com/UPNktW4pBp \u2014 NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) October 26, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The 21-year-old attacker becomes the second American to score three times in English soccer's top flight.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
