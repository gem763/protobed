Yet many of those screaming the loudest care nothing about Washington\u2019s support for the cruel, corrupt, and irresponsible Saudi regime\u2019s murderous war in Yemen. For these Americans the Kurds\u2019 plight looks mostly like an excuse to keep the U.S. mired in an endless war in the Middle East that cannot be justified on any other grounds. An unconvincing burst of moral concern is not a good reason to concoct a previously undeclared, undebated, unlegislated defense commitment.\n\nThe Kurds long have suffered and are one of the world\u2019s largest people groups without their own country. While the Kurds have understandably struggled for self-determination, however, they are not blameless. Kurdistan is more family rule than liberal democracy. The Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, in Turkey, is radical, brutal, and terrorist. Syria\u2019s Kurds have ties to the PKK and many of them look to that group\u2019s imprisoned leader, Abdullah \u00d6calan, for inspiration. Turkey overstates the dangers posed by links between Turkish and Syrian Kurds, but Washington\u2019s lack of responsiveness only has exacerbated Ankara\u2019s paranoia.\n\nWhile there is good reason to sympathize with the Kurds, they fought ISIS to advance their own self-interest, not for America\u2019s, or the international community\u2019s, benefit. Indeed, they were fighting Islamist radicals before the U.S. inserted combat forces in Syria against ISIS. Had the Islamic State been able to expand its reach, the Kurds\u2019 autonomous zone of Rojava would have been a target.", "description": "", "authors": ["Doug Bandow", "Spectator.Org President-Trump-Understands-What-Congress-Does-Not-Syria-Is-Not-Americas-War"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
