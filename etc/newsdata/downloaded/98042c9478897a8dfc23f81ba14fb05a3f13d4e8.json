It's crucial that you file for benefits at the right time, because the age you claim Social Security at will dictate how much money you collect on a monthly basis for the rest of your life.\n\nThough your benefits are calculated by taking an inflation-adjusted average of your wages during your 35 highest-paid income-earning years, that number can change based on when you file for Social Security. Here are four popular choices for claiming benefits you should know about.\n\nSix Social Security cards piled on top of each other More\n\nIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\n\n1. Age 62\n\nAge 62 is the earliest age you're allowed to file for benefits, and not surprisingly, it's also the most popular among seniors. The upside of claiming Social Security at 62 is getting your money as soon as you're eligible. The downside, however, is that you'll face the greatest possible reduction in benefits you can be hit with.\n\nYou're not entitled to your full monthly benefit based on your work record until you reach full retirement age, which, as we'll discuss in a bit, is either 66, 67, or somewhere in between. For each month you file ahead of full retirement age, your benefits get reduced. Filing at 62 will cut your benefits by anywhere from 25% to 30%, depending on your specific full retirement age, and that reduction will remain in effect permanently unless you withdraw your benefits application within a year and repay all of the money you collect. Therefore, make sure you have a good reason to take benefits at 62 before going that route.\n\n2. Age 65\n\nAge 65 is when seniors become eligible for health coverage under Medicare. As such, it's also a common age to sign up for Social Security. That said, don't be fooled into thinking you have to claim Social Security to get on Medicare, because you don't. The only advantage of being on Social Security first (or simultaneously) is that you can have your Medicare premiums deducted from your benefits so you don't need to deal with paying them yourself. But if you claim benefits at 65, you'll automatically reduce them in the process (though not to the same extent as filing at 62).\n\n3. Age 66-67\n\nAs mentioned, you're entitled to your full monthly benefit once you reach full retirement age. That age is dependent on your year of birth, as follows:\n\nIf You Were Born In: Your Full Retirement Age Is: 1943-1954 66 1955 66 and 2 months 1956 66 and 4 months 1957 66 and 6 months 1958 66 and 8 months 1959 66 and 10 months 1960 67\n\nDATA SOURCE: SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION.\n\nOnce you reach full retirement age, you can also work and collect Social Security simultaneously without having to worry about having benefits withheld. You're allowed to do both at the same time earlier, but if your earnings exceed a certain threshold, the Social Security Administration will hang onto some of your benefits and then release the difference once you reach full retirement age.\n\n4. Age 70\n\nThough you're entitled to your full monthly benefit between ages 66 and 67, you can delay benefits past that point and grow them in the process. For each year you hold off past full retirement age, you'll boost your benefits by 8%. This incentive runs out at age 70, however, so there's no sense in waiting past that point to claim Social Security.\n\nKeep in mind that the Social Security Administration won't force you to sign up for benefits once you turn 70, so you'll need to be proactive about claiming them. Wait past that point, and you risk losing out on money you're entitled to.", "description": "The decision to file for benefits is a big one.
