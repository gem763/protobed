Molina did not say when the next hearing was scheduled for in San Francisco County Superior Court.\n\nA spokeswoman for Sutter Health, Amy Thoma Tan, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.\n\nIn a 49-page complaint, Becerra alleged that Sutter has pursued numerous anticompetitive practices as it snuffed out competition and became the largest hospital system in Northern California. The lawsuit points to research showing that health care costs in Northern California are higher than elsewhere in the state and said Sutter was largely to blame for the higher costs.\n\nAt issue are several of Sutter Health\u2019s contracting policies that Becerra says have allowed the company to \u201cthoroughly immunize itself from price competition.\u201d\n\nOne way insurance companies keep costs down is to steer patients to cheaper health care providers through a variety of incentives. Becerra says Sutter Health bans insurance companies from using these incentives, making it harder for patients to use their lower-priced competitors.\n\nBecerra also says Sutter has an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach to negotiating with insurance companies, requiring them to include all the company\u2019s hospitals in their provider networks even if it doesn\u2019t make financial sense to do so.\n\nThe complaint noted that Sutter\u2019s assets rose to $15.6 billion in 2016 from $6.4 billion in 2005.\n\nSutter Health, a Sacramento-based nonprofit, denies the claims, saying it faces fierce competition across the San Francisco Bay Area and the Sacramento Valley and insurance companies are to blame for pushing up costs.\n\nBecerra\u2019s office sought injunctive relief to halt Sutter\u2019s alleged anti-competitive behavior, not monetary damages. But the private litigation brought by a class of about 1,400 self-funded employers sought damages that could have exceeded $1 billion.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One of California's largest hospital systems has reached an agreement to settle a massive class-action lawsuit over allegations that it abused its market power and has been overcharging patients for medical bills.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jocelyn Gecker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/california_hospital_chain_antitrust_lawsuit_50609_c0-165-3959-2474_s1200x700.jpg?6ad6d1ee63a21587a357bff23503addf6d2a9bb8", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
