For some reason, the bride felt she could only have one flower girl at her wedding and she chose Amber.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for my perfect day I felt shallow and since Amber has more of a typical angelic 'cute' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) I picked her. Her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did,\u201d she wrote on Reddit.\n\nAfter choosing Amber, however, the bride shared that Katie\u2019s dad \u2013 the bride's brother \u2013 had claimed that Amber had been bullying Katie about not getting chosen.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThe girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know. I didn't pay too much mind to it since I was too caught up in myself,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHowever, the bride changed her mind on her wedding day, when she \u201cgot to witness the bullying\u201d firsthand.\n\n\u201cAmber (and keep in mind this is an eight-year-old child) told Katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly. I could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and I made Amber apologize and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to Katie,\u201d she shared on Reddit.\n\nAccording to the bride, Amber didn\u2019t take it well and cried the entire wedding \u2014 and also for days after the event. Eventually, Amber\u2019s dad, the bride\u2019s other brother, called to tell her he was \u201cextremely angry\u201d at her for taking away Amber's flower girl duties.\n\n\"The girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know.

I can't imagine how upsetting those comments would be, and at that point, Katie, who had never been anything other than well behaved, deserved it more than Amber,\u201d the bride wrote, defending her decision.\n\nHowever, her brother was not the only one who felt the bride was in the wrong for her decision.\n\n\u201c[You're wrong] for not just having two flower girls. Like, why was this even an issue in the first place?\u201d one user shared in a comment, which has since been upvoted more than 23,000 times by people who agreed.\n\n\u201cThese are eight-year-old CHILDREN, not adults dealing with other adults. Not to mention they are both her nieces, not strangers or employees. If she is falling into the trap of judging her very young relatives based on their looks, that is absolutely horrifying,\u201d another wrote of the bride\u2019s decision to compare her nieces\u2019 appearances.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201c[You're the a--h---] for making it so incredibly obvious that you were picking Amber over Katie in the first place that you gave credibility to Amber's bullying.

You played favorites, then realized it was problematic when Amber exaggerated the same reasoning that led to your initial decision,\u201d another wrote.\n\nThe bride had not shared an update of the incident as of Friday.", "description": "No roses here.", "authors": ["Alexandra Deabler", "Anonymous Bride", "Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer", "Editor For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/iStock-174083010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
