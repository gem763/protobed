If someone asks me if we\u2019re going to win the Champions League, I\u2019m out of here,\u201d Tuchel told a news conference after PSG had crushed 13-times European champions Real in their Group A opener at the Parc des Princes.\n\nThe United debacle followed a 5-2 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in 2018 and a memorable loss to Barcelona in 2017 with a 6-1 defeat at the Camp Nou following a 4-0 home win.\n\n\u201cWe did not want to send a message but it is true that we controlled this game, we were well prepared,\u201d PSG centre back Thiago Silva said.\n\nHaving spent over one billion euros on players since Qatar Sports Investment took over in 2011, PSG have been expected to win the Champions League but they have fallen spectacularly short in recent seasons.\n\nThey are now focussed on the first task of getting through to the knockout phase from a group featuring Real, Club Brugge and Galatasaray.\n\nTuchel\u2019s side were outstanding against Real with Angel Di Maria scoring a double in the absence of the formidable trio of Kylian Mbappe, Edinson Cavani - both injured - and the suspended Neymar.\n\n\u201cMaybe the pressure was not too high on the players because those three were missing,\u201d said Tuchel.\n\n\u201cWithout them we were not the favourites and it freed the minds of those who were on the pitch tonight, they did not feel the pressure.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Germain acknowledged he could not afford to miss the \u201cMCN\u201d trio for too long, he was satisfied the rest of the squad made up for their absence.\n\n\u201cWe can do without them for a few games if all the others play at their best,\u201d he said.\n\nPSG recruited during the close season, notably bringing in goalkeeper Keylor Navas from Real Madrid and striker Mauro Icardi on loan from Inter Milan.\n\nBut it was midfielder Idrissa Gueye, who joined from Everton, who caught the eye on Wednesday, setting up Di Maria for the second goal and working tirelessly.\n\n\u201cIdrissa, it\u2019s incredible. I don\u2019t have the words. I don\u2019t know how many balls he won today,\u201d Silva said.", "description": "After three consecutive last-16 eliminations in the Champions League, Paris St Germain were taking their impressive 3-0 victory over Real Madrid on Wednesday with a large pinch of salt.", "authors": ["Julien Pretot", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431395625&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H22F", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
