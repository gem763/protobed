It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.\n\n\"This is a disgrace. They could vote no confidence [in the government] at any time but they are too cowardly.\"\n\nHe also said an election motion would be \"coming before the House shortly\" - although offered no further detail.\n\nFormer Tory leadership contender Rory Stewart - who had the party whip removed after backing plans to prevent a no-deal Brexit - expressed shock at the remarks.\n\nHe tweeted: \"I am horrified that when I asked the attorney general to confirm the principle of the sovereignty of Parliament that he appears to have replied - over the shouts of the House - that 'this Parliament is a disgrace.'\n\n\"Our democracy can only be and must remain founded in Parliament.\"\n\nA furious Barry Sheerman also said the attorney general had \"no shame\".\n\nThe Labour MP added: \"To come here with his barrister's bluster to obfuscate the truth? For a man like him, a party like this and a leader like this... to talk about morals and morality is a disgrace.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"No shame\" over Supreme Court ruling, says MP\n\nAnd former Tory minister Amber Rudd - who resigned over the government's handling of Brexit - urged Mr Cox to \"cease this language of pitting Parliament against the people\".\n\n\"This Parliament was elected in 2017,\" she said. \"It reflects the divisions in our country, the divisions in our community and the divisions in our families. The failure is we have not yet reached a compromise.\"\n\nMr Cox replied: \"If I had not been driven to this language, I would never have used it.\"\n\nMPs twice refused to back the prime minister's call for an election earlier this month - he needs the support of two-thirds of the House to hold one under the Fixed Terms Parliament Act.\n\nOpposition parties say they want to wait until after the PM has asked for a Brexit extension as required by the Benn bill.\n\nHe has repeatedly insisted he will not do that.\n\nMr Cox said there was \"no question of this government not obeying the law\" within the Benn bill, although \"there is a question as to precisely what obligations the law might require of the government\".", "description": "The attorney general also defends the judges' right to rule as they did, but launches a blistering attack on MPs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p7txf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
