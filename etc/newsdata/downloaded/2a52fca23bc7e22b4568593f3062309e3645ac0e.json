The Exeter man has five tries in his last nine caps, despite starting only three times, and has scored after coming off the bench against both Tonga and Argentina in this tournament.\n\nAmong the backs, South Africa have conceded tries to every spot from fly-half back to full-back \u2013 but with both wing positions and outside centre registering multiple scores, England\u2019s Jonny May, Anthony Watson and Manu Tuilagi will be eager to add to their prolific records.", "description": "Eddie Jones\u00b4 men could have to weather an early storm but Tom Curry and Luke Cowan-Dickie will take encouragement from the statistics.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/wire-20370714-1572433482-564_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
