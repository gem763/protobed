That was his wake-up call.", "language": "en", "text": "Kyle Bochniak has been sober for 10 years. And for all he\u2019s achieved as a mixed martial artist, that might take the cake for his most impressive life accolade.\n\nThe UFC featherweight will have a home game Friday night, when he takes on Sean Woodson at UFC on ESPN 6 in Boston.\n\nStepping into the cage won\u2019t be a new experience \u2013 he\u2019s done it six times before. When considering what he\u2019s been through, however, it\u2019s incredible he\u2019s even sniffed the UFC.\n\nBochniak has always had an addictive personality. It\u2019s who he was back then and who he is now. It\u2019s unlikely that will change, but he used to channel it differently. Before he was addicted to MMA and jiu-jitsu competitions, he was fixated on less healthy hobbies whether they came from the bottle or pharmacy.\n\nGrowing up, Bochniak associated with the wrong crowd. Unhealthy behaviors followed negative influences, and Bochniak began drinking excessively.\n\nWhether it was marijuana or pills, pick your poison: Bochniak was down to party. Eventually, his recklessness caught up with him.\n\n\u201cI ended up being a third-year freshman because of substance abuse,\u201d Bochniak told MMA Junkie. \u201cI was in and out of rehabs. I fell way behind in school and decided to drop out as a third-year freshman. All my friends were juniors and seniors at the time.\n\n\u201cSo I ended up dropping out, not really having anything going for myself. I kind of just coasted that for about four or five years until I turned 22.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Bochniak overdosed on prescription pills. Despite being in a coma for a week and having no recollection of the events that transpired, he wasn\u2019t interested in changing his behavior. It bared no effect on him.\n\nThe downward spiral continued.\n\nHis carelessness led him down a path that landed him in jail, which was inevitable. That\u2019s when Bochniak finally hit his lowest point. That\u2019s when he got his wake-up call. It wasn\u2019t the straight punishment that haunted Bochniak per se, but rather what happened once he was behind bars. He found out who was in the block next to his.\n\nBochniak was in the same jail as his own father, a man who had exited the picture when he was a toddler.\n\n\u201cRock bottom was when I found myself in jail,\u201d Bochniak said. \u201cMy father was in the next block over, and I never really met him. I was 2 years old when he split. That was the closest I had been to him: in jail. That was rock bottom for me. I was like, \u2018The apple really doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. I need to do something with my life here.'\u201d\n\nThat realization led to a heartfelt arraignment speech from Bochniak shortly thereafter. As a result, the judge gave him five years probation. From there, he transferred his probation to Hartford, Conn., where he learned how to become a welder.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of God, I got a nice little welding job,\u201d Bochniak said. \u201cI was just trying to stay in shape. I loved athletics. I was always such a good athlete. I stumbled into Broadway Jiu Jitsu, and it basically saved my life \u2013 John Clarke and Broadway Jiu Jitsu and mixed martial arts.\u201d\n\nThe martial arts lifestyle was, and is, the yin to Bochniak\u2019s yang personality. It keeps him focused, gives him purpose, and requires a tremendous amount of discipline. The day-to-day schedule is perfect for a person seeking structure.\n\n\u201cI just really got addicted to it,\u201d Bochniak said. \u201cEvery single morning, I aligned my whole life with my training. Everything was about training \u2013 work, when I was going to go out. Everything was around my training schedule now. It keeps me out of trouble. It keeps my head in one place. I know what sessions I have for that day. I plan my whole week out like every single week, what I\u2019m going to do. Jiu-jitsu, muay Thai, conditioning, wrestling \u2013 I lay all of my ducks in a row.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the type of person I am now, and it keeps me focused. That\u2019s what I like about martial arts and jiu-jitsu. Once you think you start learning, there\u2019s another level. It just keeps my interest, it keeps my attention, and it keeps me hungry. I just keep getting better.\u201d\n\nSince his exit from probation, Bochniak has sprinted full speed ahead with no looking back. He\u2019s compiled an 8-4 pro record, with two of those victorie in the UFC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been kind of running from that as far as I could possibly,\u201d Bochniak said. \u201cBasically fast forward: multiple jobs, years of sobriety, getting my license back, getting into mixed martial arts \u2013 that basically saved me.\n\n\u201cI had my amateur fights, my professional fights, and just slowly set goals and accomplished them. I look back 10 years now like, \u2018Jesus, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been sober for 10 years. That\u2019s crazy.'\u201d\n\nHaving found peace through violence, Bochniak will look to pass on the lessons he\u2019s learned. He hopes to provide assistance to others by opening up about his story for the first time. According to Bochniak, if he can do it, anyone can.\n\n\u201cWhen someone watches my fighting style, I want them to be like, \u2018Jeez, that kid is fighting for something. What the hell is that kid fighting for?'\u201d Bochniak said. \u201cYou can see it just in my style, the type of person I am, the type of fighter I am. I\u2019m a gritty move-forward guy when the going gets tough. I just keep going.\n\n\u201cI want to be an inspiration to people and just be optimistic. Just put that right foot forward through that adversity. Just know that you can win no matter what as long as you move forward.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN 6 takes place Friday at TD Garden in Boston.
