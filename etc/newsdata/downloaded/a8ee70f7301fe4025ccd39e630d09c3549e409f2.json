Yet accounts filed last week show losses swelled from \u00a35.2million in 2017 to \u00a316.8million last year. Reaction's last fundraise in 2018 valued it at \u00a3180million.\n\nElliott, which owns bookstore chain Waterstones and has taken stakes in Saga and Whitbread, has a stake of 8 per cent, making it one of the biggest investors in Reaction behind BAE, which took a 20 per cent stake in 2015 for \u00a320.6million.\n\nElliott's involvement is unusual. The feared activist investor is better known for its aggressive overtures at larger companies listed on the stock market. Its name strikes fear into City boardrooms, where it takes stakes and forces change.\n\nReaction chief executive Mark Thomas said it had made 'deliberate efforts' to ramp up spending, which would continue next year.\n\nHe added: 'The business we're in is all about pace. With the speed at which the market is moving, the disruptive technologies and companies out there, we absolutely have to get there as quickly as we can.'\n\nSir Richard Branson and Elon Musk are racing to be the first to fly planes into space\n\nThe company's SABRE technology \u2013 which stands for Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine \u2013 has undergone a series of early-stage tests in Colorado and is set to embark on its next phase of testing next year at the under-construction Westcott Venture Park in Buckinghamshire. Testing will last until around 2022, with the first test flight in the mid-2020s.\n\nCommercial hypersonic flights, at five times the speed of sound, are not expected to happen for 20 years. But Thomas hopes the technology will be used by billionaires such as Sir Richard Branson and Elon Musk, who are racing to be the first to fly planes into space.\n\nThe initial plan was for Reaction to build a plane \u2013 dubbed Skylon \u2013 that would be fitted with a SABRE engine. But it has decided to focus on the engine and leave building the plane to a specialist aerospace firm. The engine breathes in air \u2013 which at high speeds can reach temperatures of over 1,000C \u2013 and cools it almost instantly to avoid melting its parts. That has been tested on the ground to avoid huge costs.\n\nThomas said: 'Think of it as the world's most powerful and lightweight heat exchangers that are also highly miniaturised. It's as extreme as air coming in at one end which is the temperature of molten lava and me being able to stand at the other end holding an ice cream.'\n\nWhile the technology will not be ready for use in hypersonic travel for a number of years, the company has created a commercial division to start making money much sooner. Its air-cooling technology is being used in motorsport to manage heat in high-performance cars. It also sees opportunity in electric and hybrid cars where batteries need to be kept cool.\n\nHe said investors, who also include the Earl of Portsmouth and the Earl of Halifax, had been supportive of the long-term strategy.\n\n'We've done everything we said we were going to do by this point and that's very reassuring for anyone who has put money in. It's clearly a long game, SABRE particularly, but we have these other nearer-term opportunities that are really important,' he added.", "description": "We can reveal that Elliott Advisors and Crispin Odey are among the heavyweights to have ploughed more than \u00a3100m into Oxfordshire-based Reaction Engines.", "authors": ["Jamie Nimmo For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
