The ministry said Friday that about two dozen military vehicles \u2013 including all-terrain Tigr high-mobility multipurpose vehicles and mine-resistant Typhoon-U armored vehicles \u2013 are on their way to Russia\u2019s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria.\n\nUnder the deal agreed by Putin and Erdogan on Tuesday after marathon talks in Sochi, the Turkish offensive that threatened to destabilize the war-torn country even further has been contained to an area up to 32km inside Syria. It was agreed that the territory not affected by the offensive would be jointly patrolled by Turkish and Russian servicemen, while Moscow volunteered to assist in the withdrawal of Kurdish forces who found themselves at the mercy of the Turkish Army after their American allies hastily withdrew from the area days before the large-scale offensive kicked off.\n\nMoscow said that it\u2019s up to the Kurds to hold their end of the bargain, warning that if the militias fail to pull out and withdraw their weapons, Russia and Syria would not be able to shield them from Ankara\u2019s onslaught.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Thanks Russia!\u2019: Kurdish military chief welcomes Russian peacekeeping patrols\n\nHowever, every party, including the US and Kurds, seem to be pleased with how the situation has worked out.

Abdi pledged to \u201cprovide all kinds of help and assistance\u201d to both Russian and Syrian forces, while expressing gratitude to Putin for \u201censuring the safety of the Kurdish people.\u201d\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
