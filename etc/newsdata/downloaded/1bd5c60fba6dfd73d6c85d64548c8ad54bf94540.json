assuming Parliament sits - on holding a second referendum.\n\nThe exact terms are not yet clear but it is thought that if there is a deal then they will agree to back it on the grounds that the public are then given a final say on whether to accept it.\n\nThat referendum would then likely pitch the PM's deal against Remain.\n\nMr Johnson will resist any attempt to attach a second referendum to his deal and currently it is unclear whether there is a majority in Parliament in favour of a so-called 'People's Vote'.\n\nIf a majority does emerge for a second referendum it will be difficult for the PM to resist given that Remain-backing MPs have repeatedly shown a willingness to seize control of the Brexit process.\n\nWhat happens if the PM doesn't get a deal today or tomorrow?\n\nIf the two sides fail to agree terms today or tomorrow then the next 48 hours will become incredibly unpredictable.\n\nGiven that both sides have said progress is being made in the talks it is likely that those efforts would continue in a bid to get an agreement before Halloween.\n\nBut even if the talks do continue beyond today, the immediate focus of the EU and UK will shift to whether there will be a Brexit delay.\n\nThe first question will be whether Mr Johnson will attend the summit tomorrow. If there is no deal to be signed then European leaders will instead discuss pushing back the UK's departure date.\n\nThe PM is unlikely to want to take part in those discussions because of his opposition to any delay which raises the prospect of him boycotting the summit.\n\nWhat would happen on Saturday?\n\nRegardless of what the EU 27 agrees, the Benn Act will legally require the PM to ask Brussels for an extension if there is no agreement in place by October 19 - this Saturday.\n\nThe government has said it will comply with the rebel law and that the PM will send a letter to the bloc asking for a delay.\n\nHowever, Mr Johnson is also expected to make plain that he does not want that delay to be granted, putting the EU in a tricky position.\n\nNumber 10 has been locked in talks with the DUP in recent days over whether the unionist party can support a proposed deal. Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds are pictured leaving the Cabinet Office today after a meeting with the PM\n\nOne way around writing the letter would be for the PM to ask MPs to vote in favour of a No Deal Brexit on Saturday.\n\nBut with a majority of MPs ardently against a disorderly divorce the PM would almost certainly lose such a vote.\n\nA more likely outcome would be Remainer MPs forcing a vote on holding a second referendum.\n\nIt is currently unclear whether there is a majority in favour of a second national ballot on Brexit but it is thought the number of pro-People's Vote MPs is growing.\n\nIf MPs were able to win a vote on holding a referendum they would then have to try to pass the legislation needed to make it happen in the face of fierce government opposition.\n\nThe other alternative is that if there is no deal to discuss then the government could opt to cancel the Saturday sitting.\n\nWhat could happen next week?\n\nAssuming that Mr Johnson complies with the Benn Act and asks for a delay and one is granted then next week could see a fresh vote on holding a snap general election.\n\nMr Johnson has already tried twice to go to the country early but was thwarted by anti-No Deal MPs.\n\nOpposition leaders, including Jeremy Corbyn, have said that once No Deal is taken off the table they will support an early election.\n\nThat means that Mr Johnson, fresh from having to break his 'do or die' Brexit promise, could demand that Parliament finally let him have an election to break the stalemate.\n\nIf MPs say yes then polling day would be at the end of November or the start of December.\n\nOne alternative would be for the opposition to bring forward a vote of no confidence to oust Mr Johnson and then allow Remain MPs to try to form a government of national unity.", "description": "Brexit remains on a knife-edge this evening as the EU and UK try to hammer out a last-minute divorce deal ahead of a crunch summit tomorrow.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/15/19791428-0-image-a-54_1571235585771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
