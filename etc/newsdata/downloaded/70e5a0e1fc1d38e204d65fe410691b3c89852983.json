That\u2019s inspiring for them. The gold medal that KJT won \u2013 they have a different sensation.\n\n\u201cMy sister [former England netball head coach Tracey Neville] came to camp on Tuesday \u2013 there is a connection between women in sport, a \u2018we\u2019ve broken down these barriers ourselves and we\u2019re going to take on the world ourselves and when one of us wins we all win\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat is the connection I have found over the last 18 months. Chelsea can win the league title in the men\u2019s game and the Chelsea girls are happy. But when England win at netball, they all celebrate together. It\u2019s almost like a pack of wolves fighting together.\u201d\n\nEngland play Brazil on Saturday and the game will promote the Darby Rimmer MND foundation set up by the captain Steph Houghton\u2019s husband, Stephen Darby, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in September 2018.\n\nNeville confirmed that the returning midfielder Jordan Nobbs and her Arsenal teammate Leah Williamson would start at the sold-out Riverside \u2013 with injuries to Millie Bright, Abbie McManus, Fran Kirby and Demi Stokes clearing the way for some fringe and returning players.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Katerina Johnson-Thompson tries to take in her achievement after winning gold in Doha.

That\u2019s what I learned coming out of the last squad.\n\n\u201cI actually love working with 25 because you get to see them all together fighting for the same jersey. But when you have 20 in your squad \u2013 we have four training players as well \u2013 there is a more intense feeling \u2026 It\u2019s that Man United feeling of \u2018everyone outside these barriers are trying to do us\u2019 type thing. There\u2019s a real togetherness and I think the players have enjoyed that getting into this squad means [they] have to have played well at club level.\u201d\n\nOne player who has been a focus of Neville\u2019s attention is Arsenal\u2019s Beth Mead, who he believes can be a world beater. \u201cWe were quite tough on her coming off the back of the World Cup and she\u2019s answered everything we\u2019ve asked of her. In terms of players that score goals and [make] assists, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone like her in our team, she assists and scores in most games that she plays.\n\nCarly Telford surprised by reaction after England \u2018messed up\u2019 World Cup Read more\n\n\u201cHer delivery, think back to the World Cup, the cross in the semi-final for Ellen [White], she has an impact in every single game now \u2013 it\u2019s just the consistency. We saw Megan Rapinoe win the big award the other week; on the big occasions she delivers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge we\u2019ve set Beth. We\u2019ve shown her the stats, the assists, the goals, we\u2019ve said: \u2018You can go left or right here. Do you want to do OK, which is what we\u2019ve seen, or go to the next level?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Brazil game will be followed by a friendly in Portugal on Tuesday and then, on 9 November, England will play Germany in front of more than 77,000 at Wembley. Neville said they were building towards regular games in Premier League-standard grounds.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep producing great performances so that when we\u2019re selecting stadiums for the next four, five friendlies, we\u2019re looking at Wembley, Old Trafford, Anfield, all the biggest stadiums in the country; that\u2019s where we want to get to. That\u2019s the aim we set 18 months ago, two years ago: we want to fill Premier League stadiums. We\u2019re now close to filling the national stadium.\n\n\u201cEveryone at the FA, everybody in women\u2019s football, every player that\u2019s out there, grassroots all the way up to the WSL, it is a massive motivation and vote of confidence that what they\u2019re doing is right.\u201d", "description": "Phil Neville has praised the solidarity between women athletes after watching the England team\u2019s reactions to the heroics of Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in Doha", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41961d9585d8ee226f374f1215fb38f1d8a0c176/0_25_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=313a4aacc4d5462ea73e6bcfc6e12013", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
