They could also continue to work in the financial advice industry if they wished.\n\nAMP says the Halloween cut-off date was not a deadline but more accurately described as a milestone as it pushes ahead with an ambitious program of change.\n\n\u201cAMP wanted to provide sufficient time for practices to consider their options, after which they enter into a transition period appropriate for their choice,\u201d a spokeswoman for AMP said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve therefore decided to push back the decision date to November 29. We had already extended the deadline for practices who previously told us they needed more time.\u201d\n\nAMP says it is committed to helping advisers who are ending their association with the firm to choose the right path forward and was supporting them with a range of initiatives as it looked to reshape its business in response to significant disruption and regulatory change.", "description": "Lawyers acting for AMP planners say their investigations are well advanced and expect to file a class action before the end of the year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0597d90ce27e0a366ba0584dd9e2d0c33b36ed42", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
