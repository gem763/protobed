Politicians are allowed to offer money personally at ceremonies such as weddings and funerals.\n\nThe major opposition parties are expected to get to the bottom of the allegation in upcoming parliamentary sessions.\n\nAnother opposition lawmaker, Kazuhiro Haraguchi, the Diet affairs chief of the Democratic Party for the People, called it a \"clear violation of the public offices election law.\"\n\n\"We'd like to urge him to demonstrate his accountability,\" Haraguchi told a press conference.\n\nThe report could provide a headache for Abe, who entrusted Sugawara with overseeing Japan's trade and industrial policies in a cabinet reshuffle in September.\n\nThere was also a chorus of demands from the LDP-Komeito coalition that Sugawara should explain what happened. \"If he didn't abide by the law, we can't defend him,\" a senior Komeito lawmaker said.\n\nThe report comes at a bad time for Sugawara, who has been pressed in the Diet to explain about another recent Shukan Bunshun story that he had handed out melons and crabs to his supporters.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said it is the responsibility of Sugawara himself to explain \"as necessary\" without elaborating. Sugawara is known to be close to Suga.\n\nThe top government spokesman said he has not heard directly from Sugawara, adding that he has no plans to contact him either.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Japan's trade minister came under pressure Thursday after a weekly magazine reported that his office offered condolence money in possible violation of the country's election law.
