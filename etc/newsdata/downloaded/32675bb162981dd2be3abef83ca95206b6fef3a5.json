In a recent diversity report, Facebook said since 2014 it had raised the number of women in technical jobs from 15% to 23%, and women in senior roles from 23% to 30%.\n\nIn the US, where the population is 51% female, what is the magic number that would make Facebook\u2019s diversity effort a success in terms of gender?\n\nCorporations, under pressure to better reflect the changing face of America, often base their efforts on the premise that diversity is achieved when an organization reaches a certain \u201ccritical mass\u201d of underrepresented group members. Is there a number, or numbers, that make an organization that\u2019s dominated by one type of individual \u201csufficiently diverse?\u201d If so, who gets to determine those numbers and how?\n\nThese questions are at the heart of research by New York University\u2019s Felix Danbold and UCLA Anderson\u2019s Miguel Unzueta, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes.\n\nTheir work, which incorporates findings from seven studies, suggests that the groups people belong to and their relative standing in society play a crucial role in their perception of when an organization crosses the so-called \u201cdiversity line.\u201d Danbold and Unzueta\u2019s research indicates that the white men who dominate Facebook are likely to view the company\u2019s diversity efforts as a success while the women are likely to want a higher representation of women in technical and leadership roles before declaring victory.\n\nPrevious research has shown that diversity is a \u201cnebulous construct subject to biased interpretations along group lines,\u201d according to Danbold and Unzueta. However, they show how bias influences perceptions of diversity that are based on numerical representations, introducing an element of order to a topic many would regard as amorphous.\n\nTheir research shows that members of dominant groups perceived an organization to be diverse at lower levels than members of non-dominant groups. The differences in where they drew the line varied, depending on what people were being asked to evaluate. For example, those differences were stronger when people were asked to evaluate whether an organization was \u201csufficiently\u201d diverse versus diverse.\n\nDanbold and Unzueta\u2019s research explains why employees might evaluate a company\u2019s diversity efforts differently, depending on whether their own group holds a majority or minority position within the organization or whether they feel threatened by changes in the organization\u2019s makeup.\n\nDanbold and Unzueta employed a variety of methods and a large set of subjects. Participants were recruited online via Amazon Mechanical Turk to fill out a short survey titled \u201cIs It Diverse?\u201d and were paid between $0.25 and $0.50 per survey. Prior to taking part, the subjects had to complete a screening questionnaire in which they were asked about their age, gender, and ethnicity.\n\nIn the first study, 1,074 white and black participants were asked to evaluate one of 21 organizations whose ethnic makeup ranged from 0% black/100% white to 0% white/100% black. Then they were asked how strongly they agreed or disagreed, on a scale of 1 to 7, with these three statements: 1) this is a diverse company; 2) this company is diverse enough; 3) this company has a diversity problem.\n\nThe researchers used the first statement to measure \u201cdescriptive diversity\u201d while the second and third statements were categorized as representing \u201csufficient diversity.\u201d\n\nAs predicted, both black and white participants agreed that diversity peaked at the 50/50 stage and was lowest when either group was not represented at all. In addition, both white and black participants drew the diversity line at a point that was more favorable to their own group.\n\nHow might those findings play out in real life? Consider a scenario in which an organization develops a diversity initiative that raises the representation of black employees from single digits to around 25%, explain the authors. White employees would likely find that level sufficiently diverse while black employees would need to see their representation rise to 30% to 35% before reaching the same conclusion.\n\nA second study substituting men and women for black and white employees resulted in similar findings.", "description": "When asked if an organization was \"sufficiently diverse,\" responses differed between certain groups.", "authors": ["Evelyn Iritani"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4H08RtxKc5ILx61r2yzTQw--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/2865af7e2deaf651f340781b958777fb", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
