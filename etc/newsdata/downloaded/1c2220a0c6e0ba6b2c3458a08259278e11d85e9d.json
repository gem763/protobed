She\u2019s one of Nashville\u2019s most potent truth-tellers, and if she is less recognisable than fellow travellers Kacey Musgraves and Maren Morris, it is probably because she hasn\u2019t released new music since her 2015 major-label debut, Untamed, which yielded the hit Burning House.\n\nThat will be rectified this autumn, she informs us, to which one can only respond: bring it on. California-born, she does a remarkable job of fusing west coast liberalism and traditional country tropes during the show. There is a banjo player on stage, and Ochs\u2019s clear, true voice twangs in the right aching places while wearing a silver dress that Dolly Parton would envy. Contrastingly, the warm, engaging set is underpinned by modern dictates: don\u2019t slut-shame, she tells us on the country-pop bop My Mistake, that hails a girl who enjoys every minute of a one-night stand. Introducing it, she says: \u201cI\u2019ve been called \u2018sex positive\u2019, but guys can sing about sex and nobody labels them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A clear, true voice ... Cam. Photograph: Gus Stewart/Redferns\n\nOn the furiously percussive Diane, a married man\u2019s girlfriend apologises to his wife. \u201cSing this extra loud so those women get the apology they deserve,\u201d she directs the crowd. Later she duets with opening act Sam Williams, grandson of Hank, on the song that inspired it, Parton\u2019s Jolene. Before performing a crushingly tender version of Palace, co-written with Sam Smith, she chortles that she and Smith were a modern-day Romeo and Juliet \u2013 \u201ca straight woman and a gorgeous gay man\u201d. Everything about Cam rings true, and that will stand her in good stead.\n\n\u2022 At the Leadmill, Sheffield, on 5 September and Manchester Academy on 6 September.", "description": "One of Nashville\u2019s most potent truth-tellers does a remarkable job of fusing west coast liberalism and country tropes in a show underpinned by modern dictates", "authors": ["Caroline Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90b64b01c21ccec50d3082adbbf0b3a584817cd2/0_93_4107_2465/master/4107.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7812f1fd6dd8997c5bd6b1a2c0f8066e", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
