The split has been bitter, as shown by the absence of a statement from Pompeo expressing gratitude for McKinley\u2019s 37 years of service.\n\nMcKinley did not intend to harshly criticize Pompeo by name during his testimony, though he made clear his concerns about the politicization of the agency in the Trump administration, said two people.\n\nAD\n\nMcKinley came to Capitol Hill with an intimate understanding of how Pompeo wielded power in the highest echelons of the State Department, given his proximity to the top diplomat on his many trips abroad. McKinley flew on Pompeo\u2019s plane, advised him on a broad array of issues and used his connections throughout the Foreign Service to help Pompeo take the temperature of the building.\n\nAD\n\nPompeo has prided himself in bringing the State Department\u2019s \u201cswagger back\u201d following a dip in morale under his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, but lately the catchphrase has elicited guffaws as the secretary faces questions about his loyalty to career diplomats.\n\nMcKinley\u2019s testimony came as the House impeachment inquiry digs deeper into the actions of President Trump\u2019s top diplomat, who has lasted longer than any other member of the president\u2019s national security team.\n\nAD\n\nTrump on Wednesday expressed frustration with the growing list of U.S. officials testifying before House investigators, saying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is issuing subpoenas with abandon.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi hands them out like cookies,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office as he sat beside Italian President Sergio Mattarella. \u201cI have all these people testifying. . . . I don\u2019t even know these people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump reiterated a complaint shared by House Republicans that the depositions are being conducted behind closed doors without the presence of White House or State Department lawyers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to representation,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to lawyers. We\u2019re not allowed to have anything.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcKinley was expected to underscore an August report by the State Department\u2019s inspector general concluding that the Trump administration\u2019s political appointees bullied staffers and accused them of political disloyalty to the president, the person said.\n\nThe report condemned Kevin Moley, the assistant secretary in charge of the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, and his former senior adviser, Mari Stull. She is a former lobbyist and consultant for the food and agricultural industry who left the department early this year after reports in Foreign Policy and other outlets revealed she had compiled a list of employees she considered insufficiently loyal to Trump. Moley still holds his position, and officials have said Pompeo lacks the authority to dismiss political appointees, which diplomats say is not true.\n\nAD\n\nThe State Department accepted the recommendation of the report in August and said it would submit a \u201ccorrective action plan\u201d within 60 days, but that deadline has passed. Officials have also said there is a second inspector general report that is critical of the firing of State Department officials under Pompeo\u2019s top Iran hand, Brian Hook, but that report has not been released yet.\n\nAD\n\nMcKinley, a career diplomat and Latin America specialist, has served in several senior diplomatic posts, including as ambassador to Afghanistan, Colombia and Peru. He was serving as ambassador to Brazil last year when Pompeo recruited him as a policy adviser and a conduit between his office and the career service.\n\nThe testimony of McKinley, who occupied the seventh-floor office next to Pompeo, could do more to clarify persistent questions about the secretary\u2019s role in the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and the abrupt removal of Yovanovitch in the spring. Ahead of her ouster, the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani waged a campaign against Yovanovitch accusing her of trying to protect Biden and his son from a Ukrainian investigation and harboring an improper loyalty to liberal billionaire George Soros.\n\nAD\n\nIn her testimony last week, Yovanovitch denied those allegations and said she was \u201cincredulous\u201d that her superiors decided to remove her based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d She also took direct aim at Giuliani\u2019s associates, whom she said could have been financially threatened by her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nCurrent and former State Department officials have said Pompeo did little to stop her removal from the job.\n\n\u201cThey fired her in the most dishonorable way imaginable,\u201d said one former State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal processes.\n\nPompeo has defended his actions, saying in an interview with the news outlet the Tennessean on Friday: \u201cI protect every single State Department employee. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we asked the House of Representatives to stop their abusive prosecutions where they won\u2019t let State Department lawyers sit with our employees.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Pompeo\u2019s suggestion that he is doing diplomats a favor by pushing back against congressional requests to interview them has not been celebrated or even welcomed in some cases. Instead, several current and former U.S. officials have openly defied White House orders to avoid testifying before House investigators, choosing instead to defend their actions and describe the role of other Trump officials as the House issues subpoenas for their attendance. On Thursday, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, a central figure in the effort to push Ukraine to open the investigations, is expected to appear on Capitol Hill.\n\nAD\n\nPompeo\u2019s status as the most trusted adviser in Trump\u2019s Cabinet has led many in the building to question why he could not expend that capital to defend Yovanovitch or to thank a career diplomat on his way out the door.\n\n\u201cIt is so indicative of how fragile the secretary\u2019s relationship with the president is, even though he is the favored one in the national security environment,\u201d said one of the people familiar with McKinley\u2019s testimony, stressing that this was a personal observation, not McKinley\u2019s. \u201cThe secretary felt he could not praise Mike or thank him publicly, just as he could not stand up for Yovanovitch, who was obviously the subject of a diplomatic mugging.\u201d\n\nKaren DeYoung, Karoun Demirjian, Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Michael McKinley resigned last week after a bitter fallout with the secretary of state.", "authors": ["Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department", "John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/L_OsPvfW6_SvUzCN4jslggUTY7w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LZJV62HQFUI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
