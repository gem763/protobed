Britt\u2019s tackle at the line of scrimmage and scampered down the sideline for the program\u2019s longest TD run in more than 30 years. It gave the Gators (6-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) extra breathing room in a game they never trailed.\n\nDoing it against Auburn was extra special.\n\n___\n\nNUMBERS\n\n15_Wins with no losses all-time by San Diego against Marist after a 31-7 victory.\n\n21_Years since Tulane last opened 4-1.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "STARS", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/kent_st_wisconsin_football_20974_c0-801-1748-1820_s1770x1032.jpg?3be80b34e467948043d760c991a403253fc1dc27", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
