All three major indexes rebounded by Wednesday\u2019s close after initially diving after the Federal Reserve\u2019s 25-basis-points rate cut. The Fed didn\u2019t loosen monetary policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 managed to close with some gains, while the Nasdaq Composite finished just below break-even. President Donald Trump criticized the central bank\u2019s move, tweeting that Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the agency had \u201cno \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision.\u201d Saudi Arabia says Iran was \u201cunquestionably\u201d behind the strike on its oil facilities last Saturday and President Trump said he\u2019ll substantially increase sanctions on Iran. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we...\n\nexplain why the market initially fell when the Fed cut rates as expected;\n\nwonder if a December cut is still on the table;\n\nand watch housing starts in August hit the highest level since 2007.\n\nDivided Opinions\n\nStocks took a reversed direction near the end of the day, and two of the three major indexes closed in the black. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 36.28 points, or 0.13%, to 27147.08, while the S&P 500 edged up 1.03 points, or 0.03%, to 3006.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.62 points, or 0.11%, to 8177.39.\n\nAt the conclusion of its September meeting, the Fed lowered the target interest rates by another 25 basis points after the initial cut in July. This rate cut was largely expected by the market.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nStill, stocks dropped after the Fed\u2019s policy statement was released, as the latest \u201cdot plot\u201d\u2014the FOMC\u2019s internal survey about fed-funds rate expectations\u2014now suggests that Fed officials might be done with rate cuts for the year. For investors, that\u2019s not good enough. The market had been pricing one more cut for this year and at least three over the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cThe FOMC \u2018dots\u2019 failed to confirm this dovish stance and, while the Fed has left the door open to more cuts if needed, these are far from a done deal,\u201d wrote Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street, on Wednesday. \u201cA less accommodative Fed is likely to be bad news for risky assets [...], while it is also likely to lead to further yield-curve inversion. Expect the dollar to rally to new highs.\u201d\n\nBut this does not necessarily mean that a rate cut in December is off the table, according to Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede. \u201cThe dispersion of opinion from [the central bank\u2019s] members has increased over the past few months, as evidenced by the increasing number of dissents from these past two rate cuts, so this may be affecting the median opinion,\u201d wrote Pride on Wednesday.\n\nAt the meeting this week, for example, while Eric Rosengren of Boston Fed and Esther George of Kansas City Fed preferred to hold on to the current rate, James Bullard of St. Louis Fed wanted an even deeper cut of 50 basis points. \u201cAlternatively, it may simply mean that some members are waiting to signal changes in policy until more information is at hand for a variety of outstanding risks,\u201d wrote Pride.\n\nAmericans built 1.364 million new homes in the month of August, a 12.3% increase from the previous month. This marks the highest level since June 2007, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. The numbers are largely in line with the latest September National Association of Home Builders housing market index released yesterday, which also topped expectations, and hit the highest level since October 2018.\n\nThe report is good news for the American housing industry, which has gone through a year marked by lagging sales and sluggish construction. These latest shifts were likely driven by changes in real mortgage interest rates, as Barron\u2019s reported.\n\nThe yearly interest on a typical 30-year fixed-rate mortgage went from about 2% to almost 3% from the end of January 2018 to the beginning of November 2018. Higher borrowing costs at that time hurt demand and therefore discouraged the creation of additional supply. Since last November, however, on expectations of fed rate cuts, the inflation-adjusted mortgage rates returned to about 2%, and the housing market has since rebounded. If the market expects more rate cuts, home building will likely remain robust.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "All three major indexes rebounded by Wednesday\u2019s close after initially diving after the Federal Reserve\u2019s 25-basis-points rate cut.
