This is the third time Trump\u2019s approval ratings have reached this level of polarization. Eighty-six points also separated Democratic and Republican ratings of President Barack Obama at the time of the 2012 presidential election.\n\nGeorge W. Bush is the only other president who has had a gap of 80 or more percentage points in approval rating by party. Most of those measurements came during the fall of 2004, as he was seeking re-election, with a high of 83 points in Sept. 13-15 (95% Republican, 12% Democrat) and Oct. 1-3 (94% Republican, 11% Democrat) polls.\n\nPrior to Bush, only Ronald Reagan had registered a party gap in approval rating of at least 70 percentage points in any single poll, doing so in two separate polls during the fall of his re-election year of 1984.", "description": "", "authors": ["News.Gallup.Com Poll Trump-Job-Approval-Ties-Party-Polarization-Record.Aspx"], "top_image": ""}
