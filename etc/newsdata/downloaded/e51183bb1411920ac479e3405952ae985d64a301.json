Others brag about their polo ponies. Then there are the ones with a direct line to the White House and a willingness to operate outside their mandates \u2014 with enough money on hand to cover the legal fees from a congressional investigation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s politically appointed ambassadors have long drawn skepticism, even resentment, from career U.S. diplomats. Now, as an impeachment inquiry exposes some of their more questionable activities and threatens the career of a traditional envoy, the anger toward them is rising.\n\nCurrent and former career U.S. diplomats say Trump has handed far too many ambassadorial posts to unqualified candidates, many of whom were political donors with thin diplomatic resumes and little respect for the U.S. Foreign Service.\n\nSome say it\u2019s time to rethink, if not cap or outright bar, political appointments for ambassadorships.\n\n\u201cIt is out of whack under Trump,\u201d said Dana Shell Smith, a former career Foreign Service officer who served as the U.S. ambassador to Qatar. \u201cThese ambassadorships are being seen as the spoils, as opposed to being very serious jobs that act in the interest of the country.\u201d\n\nMost modern presidents have given roughly 30 percent of U.S. ambassador postings to political appointees, with the rest drawn from career government ranks. Under Trump, the proportions appear to have changed significantly. At present, nearly 45 percent of his ambassador picks \u2014 people who have been confirmed or are awaiting confirmation \u2014 are political appointees, one database shows.\n\nThe statistics have deeply frustrated the diplomats\u2019 union, the American Foreign Service Association, which is calling on Trump to reevaluate his approach.\n\nThe group\u2019s president, Eric Rubin, said in a statement to POLITICO that the Foreign Service Act of 1980 specifies ambassadorships should \u201cnormally be accorded to career members of the Service,\u201d with only occasional exceptions for qualified outsiders.\n\n\u201cAFSA does not believe that asking to follow the law is a radical position,\u201d Rubin said, adding that the Trump-era numbers are \u201cdismaying.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former U.S. diplomats, including those who\u2019ve been ambassadors, stress there have been some excellent political appointees in the past, and that not all career appointees are perfect. But they\u2019re alarmed by the implications of the impeachment inquiry\u2019s findings so far.\n\nThe ongoing investigation has uncovered evidence that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, was operating outside the usual State Department chain of command to pressure the Ukrainian government to launch investigations that could help Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nSondland is a hotel owner who reportedly donated $1 million for Trump\u2019s inauguration and had no notable diplomatic experience before being named to the Brussels-based post. Ukraine is not a member of the EU, making Sondland\u2019s involvement in its affairs even more odd.\n\nBut the envoy, like a handful of other political appointee ambassadors, is known to have a direct line to Trump, another reason congressional investigators are keen to understand his activities. This week, the State Department ordered Sondland not to testify before Congress, but he\u2019s been subpoenaed and has said he will appear before lawmakers.\n\nAlso caught up in the impeachment inquiry is Marie Yovanovitch, a highly regarded Foreign Service officer named ambassador to Ukraine under President Barack Obama. Yovanovitch was pulled out of Kyiv in May, a few months before she was due to leave the post, under murky circumstances.\n\nWhat is known is that the president\u2019s allies had for months spread rumors about her, claiming she was anti-Trump. Trump himself called her \u201cbad news\u201d and seemed to vaguely threaten her while talking to Ukraine\u2019s president, according to detailed call notes released by the White House.\n\nIn closed-door testimony before lawmakers Friday, Yovanovitch asserted that Trump had forced her out of her position based on \"unfounded and false claims.\" She also warned lawmakers that many of \u201cthis nation\u2019s most loyal and talented public servants\u201d are looking to quit.\n\nDemocrats said the State Department and White House had tried to bar Yovanovitch's testimony, but investigating House committees had issued a subpoena and she'd complied with it.", "description": "Then there are the ones with a direct line to the White House and a willingness to operate outside their mandates \u2014 with enough money on hand to cover the legal fees from a congressional investigation.
