The bank and its U.S. lawyers have refused to accept a legal summons or acknowledge U.S. legal authority in the matter. At a hearing Tuesday, no lawyers or executives showed up to represent the bank. A day earlier Turkey named a former executive at the bank, who\u2019d been convicted in the U.S., to head the Istanbul stock exchange.\n\nTensions between Turkey and the U.S. have heightened since President Donald Trump ordered the removal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, opening the door for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to send his forces to attack Kurds in the region.\n\nThe incursion spurred the U.S. to sanction Turkey with Trump writing a letter last week to Erdogan imploring him not to be a \u201ctough guy\u201d or a \u201cfool.\u201d Erdogan reportedly threw the letter in the trash.\n\nEarlier, Trump threatened Turkey in a statement on Twitter.\n\nU.S. authorities had been pursuing a criminal case against the bank for at least a year, seeking to impose a massive financial penalty for its role in the scheme. But the case idled for months amid diplomatic wrangling until the charges were filed along with other sanctions last week.\n\nRead more on the charges here\n\nFederal prosecutors with the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office have now deemed Halkbank a \u201cfugitive,\u201d and told U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman they may seek contempt sanctions if the bank fails to respond to renewed demands for its presence in court. Halkbank has no employees or offices in the U.S., though it does have a correspondent bank account and shares that are listed and traded as American depositary receipts in U.S. markets.\n\nThe judge said he would consider the request but also said he wanted to give the bank two weeks to review the matter and reconsider its position.\n\nIf Turkey\u2019s current position on the issue is any indication, it may take more than two weeks: on Monday, it named a former Halkbank executive who was convicted in a U.S. trial over the sanctions scheme as the new chief executive of the Istanbul stock exchange. The executive, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, was released from U.S. custody in July. In making the appointment, Turkish finance minister Berat Albayrak, who is also Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law, said Atilla was the victim of an \u201cunjust conviction.\u201d\n\n(Corrects bank\u2019s name in second paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christian Berthelsen in New York at cberthelsen1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Joe Schneider\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Turkey is snubbing U.S. demands for one of its biggest banks to face charges that it helped Iran evade sanctions amid escalating tensions fueled by Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria.U.S. prosecutors charged Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS last week with enabling a sanctions-evasion scheme", "authors": ["Christian Berthelsen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4ER_0Z94fjW4sXJpIuwJlA--~B/aD0xNzYwO3c9MjY0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/37d3b34733e2ca66f272dbd70f811cbe", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
