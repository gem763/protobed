government has a legal obligation to reach net zero emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. However, the CCC, which is the government\u2019s advisory body, said demand for flights must be curbed to tackle greenhouse gas emissions as part of the UK\u2019s climate targets.\n\nCurrent planned additional capacity in London, including a third runway at Heathrow \u201cis likely to leave at most very limited room for growth at non-London airports\u201d, the committee said.\n\nThe UK needs to limit the growth in demand for flights to no more than 25 per cent above current levels by 2050, according to the CCC, yet Heathrow expansion plans could see the number of passengers using the airport rise to 132 million, an increase of 60 per cent.\n\nJohn Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the government continues to be making the right noises about the climate emergency but is still not doing the right thing.\n\nHe said: \u201cHeathrow\u2019s third runway is the poster child for this huge disconnect between official rhetoric and action. An enormous expansion of carbon emissions and pollution at the exact moment they agreed to do the opposite is unacceptable. The government needs to curb emissions now by tackling the growth in aviation.\u201d\n\nThe other part of the argument is about the absence of plans to address commitments under the Habitats Directive, which means expansion expansion must not have significant negative impacts on the local environment.\n\nJenny Bates, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said expanding Heathrow would see a huge increase in emissions.\n\n\u201cDeclaring a climate emergency while backing Heathrow\u2019s third runway project shows the climate hypocrisy of our government,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time the government is held to account over the third runway, and for more thought to go into what a third runway would mean for the planet. We need to be cutting down the number of planes in our skies, not giving them a massive daily boost.\u201d\n\nThe House of Commons overwhelmingly voted in favour of the \u00a318bn third runway plans at Heathrow last year, approving transport secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s plans by 415 votes to 119.\n\nThe defendant in this legal challenge is the Department for Transport. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d\n\nA Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cJudicial reviews are common in infrastructure projects of this size. Our plans remain on track and we will support the Department for Transport throughout this process.\n\n\u201cWe remain totally confident in the robust process that has got us to this point, including the extensive evidence gathered by the independent Airports Commission, multiple rounds of public consultation and the overwhelming cross-party support of parliament.\u201d\n\nThe hearing \u2013 which starts on Thursday morning at 8.45am \u2013 is expected to last six days.", "description": "Campaigners are taking the government to the Court of Appeal over the Heathrow expansion plans which they say are \u201cincompatible\u201d with reaching legally binding net zero 2050 goals.\u00a0 The mayor of London, five local authorities and environmental campaigners Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are among those challenging the decision to build a third runway.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/16/istock-987576728.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
