REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nThe incursion, launched after Trump withdrew U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against Islamic State militants, has opened a new front in the eight-year-old Syrian civil war and drawn fierce international criticism.\n\nIn Washington, Trump - fending off accusations that he abandoned the Kurds, loyal allies of the United States - suggested that Washington could mediate in the conflict, while also raising the possibility of imposing sanctions on Turkey.\n\nOn Friday, Turkish warplanes and artillery struck around Syria\u2019s Ras al Ain, one of two border towns that have been the focus of the offensive. Reuters journalists heard gunfire there from across the frontier in the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar.\n\nA convoy of 20 armoured vehicles carrying Turkish-allied Syrian rebels entered Syria from Ceylanpinar. Some made victory signs, shouting \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d (God is greatest) and waving Syrian rebel flags as they advanced towards Ras al Ain.\n\nSome 120 km (75 miles) to the west, Turkish howitzers resumed shelling near the Syrian town of Tel Abyad, a witness said.\n\n\u201cIn these moments, Tel Abyad is seeing the most intense battles in three days,\u201d Marvan Qamishlo, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said.\n\nOvernight, clashes erupted at different points along the border from Ain Diwar at the Iraqi frontier to Kobani, more than 400 km to the west. Turkish and SDF forces exchanged shelling in Qamishli among other places, the SDF\u2019s Qamishlo said.\n\n\u201cThe whole border was on fire,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkish forces have seized nine villages near Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, said Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war.\n\nAt least 32 fighters with the SDF and 34 Turkey-backed Syrian rebels have been killed in fighting, while 10 civilians have been killed, Abdulrahman said. The SDF said 22 of its fighters were killed on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nTurkey says it has killed hundreds of SDF fighters in the operation and one Turkish soldier has been killed.\n\nIn Syria\u2019s al Bab, some 150 km west of the offensive, some 500 Turkish-backed Syrian fighters were set to head to Turkey to join the operation, CNN Turk reported. It broadcast video of them performing Muslim prayers in military fatigues, their rifles laid down in front of them, before departing for Turkey.\n\n\u201cHUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE\u201d\n\nTurkey says the purpose of its assault is to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an enemy for its links to insurgents in Turkey. It says it aims to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria, where it can resettle many of the 3.6 million refugees it has been hosting.\n\nTurkey\u2019s President Tayyip Erdogan criticised Europe for failing to support the Turkish offensive and threatened to send refugees to Europe if the EU did not back him.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk responded on Friday by chastising Erdogan for making the threat.\n\n\u201cTurkey must understand that our main concern is that their actions may lead to another humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d he said.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee aid group says 64,000 people in Syria have fled in the first days of the campaign.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG is the main fighting element of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which have acted as the principal allies of the United States in a campaign that recaptured territory held by the Islamic State group.\n\nThe SDF now holds most of the territory that once made up Islamic State\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria, and has been keeping thousands of Islamic State fighters in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nA camp sheltering more than 7,000 displaced people in northern Syria is to be evacuated and there are talks on moving a second camp for 13,000 people including Islamic State fighters\u2019 familes, after both were shelled, Kurdish-led authorities said.\n\nMedecins Sans Frontieres said a hospital in Tel Abyad had been forced to shut after most of its staff fled from bombings over the past 24 hours.\n\nRARE REPUBLICAN CRITICISM OF TRUMP\n\nIn the United States, Trump\u2019s decision to withhold protection from the Kurds has been one of the few issues to prompt criticism from his fellow Republicans, including leading allies on Capitol Hill such as Senator Lindsey Graham.\n\nTrump said in a Twitter post on Thursday: \u201cWe have one of three choices: Send in thousands of troops and win Militarily, hit Turkey very hard Financially and with Sanctions, or mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds!\u201d.\n\n\u201cI hope we can mediate,\u201d Trump said when asked about the options by reporters at the White House.\n\nWithout elaborating, he said the United States was \u201cgoing to possibly do something very, very tough with respect to sanctions and other financial things\u201d against Turkey.\n\nWestern countries\u2019 rejection of the Turkish offensive creates a rift within the NATO alliance, in which Turkey is the main Muslim member.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said after talks with Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in Istanbul that he expected Turkey to act with restraint in Syria. Cavusoglu said Ankara expected \u201cstrong solidarity\u201d from the alliance.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nStoltenberg also told reporters the international community must find a sustainable solution for Islamic State prisoners in Syria.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has called for an emergency meeting of the U.S.-led coalition of more than 30 countries created to fight Islamic State. France\u2019s European affairs minister said next week\u2019s EU summit will discuss sanctions on Turkey over its action in Syria.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned that Islamic State militants could escape from jail as a result of the Turkish offensive, the Interfax news agency reported.", "description": "Turkey stepped up its air and artillery strikes on Kurdish militia in northeast Syria on Friday, escalating an offensive that has drawn warnings of humanitarian catastrophe and turned Republican lawmakers against U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439671598&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A140", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
