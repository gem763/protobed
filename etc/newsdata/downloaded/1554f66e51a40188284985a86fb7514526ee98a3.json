But when Which? clicked through, it says there were four identical \"budget double rooms\" for the same price of \u00a349.\n\nThe CMA, which first launched its investigation into online booking sites last October, sent warning letters to \"a range of sites\" in June, demanding they review their practices to make sure they are fair, and comply with consumer protection law.\n\nMisleading holidaymakers\n\nDespite the move, Which? Travel's Naomi Leach says consumers are still being pressured into making bookings.\n\n\"We found clear evidence that Booking.com has not yet sufficiently cleaned up its act and is flouting the rules on pressure-selling, which could lead to millions of consumers being rushed into making a booking,\" she said.\n\n\"It must now provide cast-iron guarantees that it won't continue to mislead holidaymakers with these unscrupulous practices. Otherwise, the regulator will have to step in with strong action to bring it into line.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Booking.com told the BBC: \"We work continuously to bring transparency, choice and value to travellers, constantly testing and improving the way in which we present our services online.\n\n\"We have worked hard to implement the commitments agreed with the CMA and maintain continuing collaboration and dialogue to inform ongoing enhancement of the consumer experience.\"", "description": "The consumer watchdog claims the website is still using 'pressure-selling' tactics.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EA83/production/_108853006__105498503_gettyimages-1124501634-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
