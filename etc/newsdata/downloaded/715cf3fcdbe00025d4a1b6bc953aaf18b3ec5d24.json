Bush narrowly won New Mexico in 2004, but the state has not been a competitive battleground since then. Clinton defeated Trump in New Mexico by more than 8 points in 2016.\n\nDemocrats won back two congressional districts in Minnesota in the 2018 midterms even as they lost two other districts in the state, highlighting the turbulent politics there.\n\nTrump and his campaign are hoping that in the presidential election next year, they can win back the areas they lost in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be focusing attention on these freshmen members of the House, which by the way, are Trump districts, districts that the president carried, if we didn\u2019t believe that public sentiment was against the Democrats in large parts of the country outside of Washington, D.C.,\u201d the campaign official said.\n\nNew Mexico will likelier be a heavier lift for Trump.\n\nThe campaign official said the state landed on the campaign\u2019s radar after the president held a rally in El Paso, Texas. The campaign said it noticed many people coming in for the rally from southern New Mexico and that subsequent polling indicated surprising strength for the president there.\n\n\u201cWe did some polling there and we see it\u2019s very competitive\u2026we definitely have a shot at winning in 2020,\u201d the official said.\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign said it will play in New Hampshire, which Clinton carried by less than half a point in 2016.\n\nStill, most political analysts view the path to the White House going through Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump turned all three of those states red for the first time in decades in 2016. If the entire electoral map remains the same but Trump loses those three states, the Democratic candidate will win the White House.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign says it is hiring staff and opening field offices in Minnesota and New Mexico, two traditionally blue states the president\u2019s strategists have identified as having potential to flip in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonaldlouisianarally3_101119screenshot.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
