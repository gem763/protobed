That includes more than $32 billion in giving to his own international network of grant makers, the Open Society Foundations, which has worked to promote democracy in some 120 nations. (The OSF has been a financial supporter of NPR.)\n\nSoros, 89, has made enemies on the right for his political contributions, including millions during the 2016 election to groups that opposed Trump and instead backed Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates.\n\nSoros, who is Jewish and a survivor of the Nazi occupation of Hungary, has also been a frequent target of conspiracy theorists, white nationalists and neo-Nazis.\n\nHis new book, In Defense of Open Society, published this week, compiles a selection of his (often worrisome) essays in which Soros muses on what he views as modern threats to democratic societies \u2014 including social media and artificial intelligence, particularly when used by authoritarian regimes to manipulate the public.\n\nBut, pointing to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong as just one example of uprisings inspired by the oppressed, Soros said he is hopeful that political and social forces will change in his direction. He said, \"The people ... are so distressed that they are willing to sacrifice their lives in order to oppose this oppression.\"\n\nDomestically, Soros says he's directing his energy these days on OSF's work to support democracy. \"My foundation and I'm personally very much engaged in fighting voter suppression, trying to get a proper census and things like that that will lead to a fair election because those conditions are also endangered by the current president,\" he said.\n\nAddressing the impeachment inquiry, Soros said that if the House votes to impeach President Trump, he doubts the Senate will earn the two-thirds majority required to then remove the president from office.\n\n\"I don't think it will be actually successful, because he has come to dominate the Republican Party \u2014 that even though there are increasing numbers of Republican senators who are very disturbed by the results of his actions, I don't think there will be a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict him,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020, Soros, in an interview with The New York Times, said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren looked like \"the clear-cut person to beat,\" in the race for the Democratic nomination. But he said he was not endorsing Warren.\n\nAlthough Warren and one of her main rivals for the nomination, Vermont's Bernie Sanders, want to impose higher taxes on the wealthy, Soros says he supports a wealth tax. He said wealthy owners of tech companies have carried economic inequality to \"totally unacceptable levels,\" and that a \"wealth tax is a very good way to reduce it.\"\n\nIf this moment of populist rise can be construed as a repudiation of his support for liberal democratic values, Soros doesn't see it that way. \"If you really have principles that you believe in, then you have to fight for them \u2014 win or lose,\" he said.\n\nNPR's Gemma Watters and William Troop produced and edited the audio version of this story.", "description": "The billionaire philanthropist and liberal champion says the wealthy and powerful in government worldwide are posing a danger to the societal freedoms of \"inclusive democracies.\"", "authors": ["Michel Martin", "Emma Bowman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/25/gettyimages-693700256_wide-6c15ccffdfbaa9c7b99ad4ad1b47e1b6ba7a1c2c.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
