She\u2019s at the top of the list of potential running mates for the 2020 Democratic presidential field. And she\u2019s only seen her profile rise since last fall by contending that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, defeated her through underhanded tactics. She\u2019s also started two new organizations devoted to leveling the playing field.\n\nThe core of Abrams\u2019s argument against Kemp is that during his tenure as secretary of state from 2010 to 2018, he engaged in systematic voter suppression by removing more than a million voters from the state\u2019s rolls between 2012 and 2017, and by employing a policy called \u201cexact match,\u201d which suspended voter registrations because of minor discrepancies between different records systems.\n\nBut she has also spoken about the climate of fear that has long existed in the Deep South and was perpetuated by incidents like the arrest, prosecution and legal limbo of the so-called Quitman 10+2 from 2010 to 2016, in which Kemp played a part. Yahoo News published an extensive investigation in August into this incident, showing that Kemp kept the matter open before the state\u2019s Board of Elections for over a year after a jury had found no wrongdoing in the matter.\n\n\u201cIt created for the entire community a sense of \u2018Do not try this, do not believe that your democratic rights are real because the power that is embedded in the state will shift your life for you, will steal from you your authority and your autonomy, but worse will punish you for even believing that you have this capacity,\u2019\u201d Abrams said of the Quitman 10+2. \u201cI'm incredibly proud of those women because they continue to fight, but their fight is made harder because power was used to crush them and to create a permanent atmosphere of fear and of retribution.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Abrams acknowledged that there are many people who have a hard time believing that there is widespread voter suppression that disproportionately affects people of color and the poor.\n\n\u201cI do believe skeptics can be converted, but part of the reason it\u2019s hard \u2026 [is] because the notion of voter suppression is linked in the common parlance with the 1950s, 1960s, with billy clubs and with hoses and dogs barking at voters trying to get inside, with poll taxes,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cCurrent day voter suppression is much more insidious, in part because it looks like user error. It\u2019s \u2018You should have checked to make sure you\u2019re still on the rolls,\u2019 as opposed to putting the onus on a system that should not be allowed to remove you without an extraordinary exercise.\u201d\n\nAbrams is trying mightily to bring more attention to the issue of voter suppression, believing that she can move the ball forward slowly but surely.\n\n\u201cThe reality is it is difficult right now for people to grasp the scope of voter suppression because we do not talk about it. But I think the more we talk about it, the more you find converts. And I\u2019ve seen that in the work that I\u2019ve done over the last 11 months,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, the impeachment inquiry into President Trump launched by congressional Democrats will be the only thing anyone talks about for the next few months, and likely for some time after that. Nonetheless, Abrams said she still expects the issue of voter suppression to be a major theme of the 2020 election, in part because there is some overlap between the topic of foreign interference and elections and voting rights.\n\n\u201cWhen outside actors take away the autonomy and choice of individuals to vote, that is part and parcel of the conversation of suppression. It\u2019s not going to be framed that way, but it does raise the question in voters\u2019 minds of how independent is their ability to make choices, and do they have the right to do so,\u201d Abrams said.", "description": "Stacey Abrams talks about the challenge of winning over those who doubt that voter suppression is a problem.", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Senior Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7DvdYDJWiSUUx6.7odBKyQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cae90110-ea28-11e9-8fdb-8e9ce7392441", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
