True, that was in part because of the artful deception by Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, in releasing the report \u2014 but only in part. Over all, the report was anticlimactic. It persuaded virtually no one who wasn\u2019t already persuaded of Trump\u2019s unfitness.\n\nIf the Democrats had impeached him after the report\u2019s release \u2014 after specifically saying that they would make their decision based on the report \u2014 they would not have persuaded many swing voters (or virtually any Republicans). I understand that many progressives wanted House Democrats to impeach Trump anyway, as a matter of principle. But I think that view overlooks the history and purpose of impeachment: It is, again, a political process.\n\nIf you impeach a president and fail to damage his political standing \u2014 if you\u2019re just as likely to shore up his standing, as I think a post-Mueller impeachment would have \u2014 you\u2019re doing it wrong. You are going to political war with the Constitution you want rather than the one the country has.\n\nMany House Democrats understood this. They\u2019ve certainly made mistakes since retaking House control this year \u2014 namely, failing to hold investigative hearings that might have shifted public opinion. But Democrats were right to reject calls for impeachment. Most House members who represent swing districts were right about this, and so was Nancy Pelosi.\n\nAnd they are right to be changing their minds now.\n\nStarting an impeachment inquiry is the proper move because of both what\u2019s changed and what hasn\u2019t. What has changed? In his dealings with Ukraine, the president committed a new and clearly understandable constitutional high crime: He put his own interests above the national interest by pressuring a foreign country to damage a political rival. He evidently misused taxpayer money in the process. He has shown he\u2019s willing to do almost anything to win re-election.", "description": "Trump was always unfit, but that\u2019s not enough.", "authors": ["David Leonhardt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/opinion/25leonhardt-newlsetter-onsite/25leonhardt-newlsetter-onsite-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
