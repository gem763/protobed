Upon arriving in New York from Minnesota, she signs up with a pimp named C.C. and becomes a prostitute and later a porn actor. Both jobs are detailed graphically. Before The Deuce, Meade\u2019s career had included several difficult sex scenes (the first, when she was 16, involved her character\u2019s rape by an older man)\u2014but she had powered through them with gritted teeth. Approaching Season 2, however, she felt ill: She now knew just how dense with difficult sex The Deuce could be, and #MeToo had brought back memories of sexual traumas she had suffered in her own life.\n\nThe first time Meade worked closely with Rodis was for a scene in which her character travels to Los Angeles for the Adult Film Association of America Awards. There she meets a talent scout named Greg, played by Ryan Farrell; they flirt, pile into the back of his limousine, snort some cocaine, and\u2014fully clothed\u2014make out. By any standard, let alone The Deuce\u2019s, the scene is tame. Meade was nonetheless anxious. She didn\u2019t know Farrell, and the atmosphere on TV and movie sets had recently grown tense. \u201cThis is right when we came back to work, right after Time\u2019s Up. Everyone\u2019s walking on eggshells,\u201d she told me. \u201cObviously any decent man is going to feel uncomfortable just grabbing at my breast.\u201d Farrell told me that he was, in fact, concerned about Meade\u2019s well-being, but wasn\u2019t sure how to effectively convey that concern. \u201cIf you keep telling somebody you\u2019re not a creep, it\u2019s kind of creepy,\u201d he said.\n\nAhead of the shoot, the episode\u2019s director, Steph Green, explained her vision of the scene to Rodis, who called the actors to run through a proposed plan. Afterward, Rodis made sure that each actor\u2019s contract had a rider stipulating that Farrell would touch Meade\u2019s clothed breasts, and Meade would grab Farrell\u2019s crotch through his pants, under which he\u2019d be wearing a prosthetic penis. The day of filming, Green, Rodis, and both actors met in private to prepare. (Green has long run trust- and chemistry-building exercises before intimacy scenes.) Before rehearsing the scene, she and Rodis asked the actors to hold each other\u2019s gaze for a long interval. The actors also took turns inviting each other to touch agreed-upon body parts: hand, knee, thigh, and so on.\n\nWhen it was time to shoot, the aforementioned prosthetic was produced. \u201cIt was an actual fake penis that they use in some of the scenes,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s pretty extreme!\u2019 \u201d He put it in his pants. \u201cEmily got to actually feel it when it was on top of me,\u201d he said, \u201cand when things like that start happening, it\u2019s an icebreaker, and everybody loosens up a bit.\u201d\n\nFarrell and Meade got in the back of the limo, together with a cameraperson, while Rodis and Green watched the scene via monitor. (By long-standing tradition, TV and movie sex scenes are filmed on closed sets, without any unnecessary people milling around.) Early in the proceedings, they paused to fine-tune the way Farrell was touching Meade\u2019s breast. \u201cHis hand was sort of flat,\u201d Meade recalled. As a result, Rodis said, it looked as if Farrell\u2019s character was pinning Lori down instead of caressing her. \u201cIf you give your hand just a little bit of a cup to it and bring it underneath,\u201d she told Farrell, \u201cit isn\u2019t going to look like you\u2019re forcing her down.\u201d The small adjustment didn\u2019t require added contact or pressure, Rodis said, but it made the scene into \u201can intimate moment and not something that he was pushing her into.\u201d In the context of Lori\u2019s story line, that was a crucial distinction. For all her sexual encounters up to this point in the series, this is the first one we see unfold entirely outside her pimp\u2019s clutches\u2014the first one she appears to actually want.", "description": "How Hollywood grew wary of intimacy", "authors": ["Kate Julian"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/07/DIS_Sketch_Julien_SexCoach_forcrops/facebook.jpg?1564493130"}
