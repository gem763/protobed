We need time again to build that togetherness that you need when you are competing at this level.\u201d\n\nPochettino spoke about needing time to get players \u201con the same page,\u201d about needing two transfer windows to \u201cfix this type of situation and sort it.\u201d\n\nIn essence, Pochettino is saying there are divisions in his squad, which is going to need to be refreshed, even rebuilt.\n\nAlready the longest-serving manager in the Premier League working solely in the top flight, is Pochettino the man to carry out this job and inject some freshness?\n\nSpurs are in the midst of a long rut which, somewhat paradoxically, includes a spectacular run to the Champions League final where they lost to Liverpool in June.\n\nTaking into account all matches since the middle of February, they have won eight of 26. This season, it is just two wins in its eight matches in all competitions, and the record includes a home loss to Newcastle, the squandering of a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 against Olympiakos in the Champions League, and now an exit at the first hurdle of a cup competition at the expense of a team 71 places lower in English soccer\u2019s pyramid.\n\nThe last away win in the league came on Jan. 20, against a Fulham team headed for relegation.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at key problems facing Pochettino:\n\nSQUAD TENSIONS\n\nIt seems some players don\u2019t want to be at Tottenham anymore, and other senior members of the squad are unsettled.\n\nChristian Eriksen is an obvious example, having said in the offseason he was keen to \u201ctry something new\u201d amid interest from Real Madrid.The Denmark playmaker who pulls everything together in midfield has only started four of Tottenham\u2019s eight games this season.\n\nLike Eriksen, center backs Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld are in the final year of their contracts. Vertonghen, widely recognized as Tottenham\u2019s best defender, was left out of the team\u2019s first three league games.\n\nThen there are England internationals Dele Alli and Eric Dier who are no longer flavor of the month. The slump of Alli, who used to strike up such a good relationship with Harry Kane up front, has been marked, while Dier\u2019s first minutes of the season came against on Tuesday against Colchester.\n\nThe closure of the European transfer window on Sept. 2 was supposed to unify an unsettled squad, ending uncertainty around some players, but that doesn\u2019t appear the case.\n\nMIDFIELD ISSUES\n\nBack in the early days of Pochettino\u2019s reign, Tottenham - an underdog battling to mix it with country\u2019s biggest clubs - stood out because of the cohesion of its young, hungry squad but also the intensity of its team.\n\nPep Guardiola, for example, said he was blown away by the energy of Tottenham\u2019s suffocating press when he slipped to his first loss as Manchester City manager, 2-0 in October 2016 at the old White Hart Lane.\n\nThe current Tottenham team doesn\u2019t seem to have those qualities, with the center of midfield a particular problem for Pochettino. Mousa Dembele used to set the tone for Spurs with his technique, driving runs and intensity of press, and he had a great partnership with Vincent Wanyama.\n\nOffseason signing Tanguy Ndombele might prove to be a like-for-like long-term replacement for Dembele, but Pochettino\u2019s preferred central midfield appears to be Moussa Sissoko and Harry Winks, who can\u2019t seem to control matches. Tottenham has already thrown away leads against Arsenal, Olympiakos and Leicester this season.\n\nUNSETTLED TEAM\n\nDoes Pochettino even know his best starting lineup anymore?\n\nWho is the first-choice right back after the departure of Kieran Trippier? When will he give Eriksen a sustained run in the team? Where does Alli now fit in? Why is Kane playing so deep these days?\n\nPochettino has never had such depth in his attacking midfield options, especially, but he doesn\u2019t appear to have settled on a formation.\n\n\u201cTo keep the successful period in football, you need to be different every single season and act differently and find a different solution,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cMaybe we need to do something different.\u201d\n\nTottenham, which is seventh in the Premier League after two wins from its first six games, has a benign run of fixtures to get some momentum going in its season, with the next three against Southampton, Brighton and Watford.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tottenham broke into English soccer's established elite through squad unity, the energy of youth and a common purpose created by manager Mauricio Pochettino.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/britain_soccer_league_cup_67123_c0-18-3180-1872_s1770x1032.jpg?9472f0b0de9bb7821f1a227e30263ff2ce5d1d77", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
