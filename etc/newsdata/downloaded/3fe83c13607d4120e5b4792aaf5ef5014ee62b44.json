Boeing\u2019s premiere private jet retails for $57 million when new, plus an additional $20 million to $25 million for the interior design and installation.\n\nTravolta has had his pilot license for 45 years and a jet license for 20. He is such an avid flier that his house is attached to a runway, so he can literally park his jets in the driveway. Jay Leno was so impressed that he called Travolta a \u201chero.\u201d\n\nTravolta\u2019s jet, which is based on the Boeing 737, has a fuel range of almost 6,000 miles. So if wife Kelly Preston wants pizza for date night, they can fly from Florida to Italy for a fresh slice.\n\nThe 737 is designed to carry approximately 150 passengers but Travolta\u2019s jet has been customized to carry 15 people in extreme comfort. The plane features two bedrooms as well as a full-size bathroom and shower.\n\nJay Leno\u2019s Garage airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on CNBC.\n\nWatch as Joaquin Phoenix talks about massive weight loss for Joker:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nTell us what you think!
