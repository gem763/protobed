Officials released clips of nearly 1,200 officer body camera videos, many hours of 911 audio recordings and dozens of handwritten and transcribed witness accounts.\n\nBut 730 days later, no one can definitively say what Paddock\u2019s motive for the massacre was.\n\nMGM RESORTS TO CONVERT LAS VEGAS SHOOTING SITE INTO COMMUNITY CENTER, MEMORIAL\n\nPaddock acted alone when he planned and carried out the attack, Aaron Rouse, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Las Vegas office, said in January. The 64-year-old fatally shot himself as police arrived into his hotel suite.\n\nLas Vegas police closed their investigation in August 2018 without establishing a motive.\n\nPaddock was a retired postal service worker, accountant and real estate investor who owned rental properties and homes in Reno and in a retirement community more than hour\u2019s drive from Las Vegas. He also held a pilot\u2019s license and liked to gamble tens of thousands of dollars at a time.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER WHO 'FROZE' DURING 2017 MASSACRE IS FIRED BY DEPARTMENT\n\nPolice characterized him as a loner who had no religious or political affiliations, despite reports he had ranted about the Federal Emergency Management Agency \u201ccamps\u201d set up after Hurricane Katrina and deadly standoffs between law enforcement officers and militia groups at Waco, Texas, in 1993 and Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992.\n\nAuthorities said he began to stockpile weapons about a year before the attack and spent $1.5 million in the two years before Oct. 1, 2017. He also started to distance himself from his girlfriend and family.\n\nPaddock sent his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, to visit her family in the Philippines two weeks before the attack. He also wired her $150,000 while she was there. She returned to the U.S. after the shooting and told authorities he had complained that he was sick and doctors told him he was suffering from an incurable \u201cchemical imbalance.\u201d\n\nLAS VEGAS SHOOTER'S FATHER, 'BINGO BRUCE', LIVED COLORFUL LIFE OF CRIME AND DECEPTION\n\nIn the days before Paddock fired more than 1,000 rounds with assault-style rifles into a country music festival, video footage showed him wheeling bag after bag into his hotel suite while security guards helped him. More than 30 video clips have been released showing Paddock interacting with Mandalay Bay staff, playing the casino\u2019s gaming machines and transporting the bags.\n\nDespite police finding 23 weapons in Paddock\u2019s room after the shooting, he left no note to explain the chaotic mess he left behind.\n\nAs part of the memorial events this year, officials held a Sunrise Remembrance ceremony to honor the 58 that were killed.\n\nFINAL RECORDS RELEASED BY POLICE IN LAS VEGAS MASS SHOOTING\n\n\u201cAll through the darkness came out an immense light,\u201d Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday morning. \u201cOur Las Vegas family showed its true colors like never before. To give blood, to give comfort, to give support and to push through the next day and the next and the one after that.\u201d\n\nThe Nevada DMV also released \u201cForever Strong\u201d license plates today, with proceeds going toward the Vegas Strong Resiliency Center, described as a \u201cplace of healing and support dedicated to serving as a multi-agency resource and referral center for residents, visitors and responders affected by the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nLacey Newman was shot in the leg during the attack but managed to keep running.
