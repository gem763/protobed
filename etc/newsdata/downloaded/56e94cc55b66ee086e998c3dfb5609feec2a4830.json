Bride and Prejudice star Tori (right) was asked the uncomfortable question on Sunday night's episode\n\nTori was quick to accuse rival Dannii of asking the question - which she vehemently denied.\n\n'Last time I checked, one standard drink a night, but, Dannii, go ahead,' Tori said, while everyone stared on in shock.\n\n'That was not me! If you wanna start on me... No, no, no!' Dannii retorted.\n\n'Yes, I might believe that, but I didn't ask that question. She's just assumed it's me.'\n\n'It wasn't me!' Dannii (pictured) was left furious after Tori accused her of asking the question\n\nAwkward game: The group were able to ask anonymous questions to the other couples about their relationship\n\nClearly upset, Tori decided to remove herself from the situation, saying: 'I'm going to bed for the night. I can't deal with this s**t anymore.'\n\nFinding the situation too much, Tori was then seen bursting into tears in an emotional scene with her other half.\n\nAfter the episode aired, Tori took to Instagram to unveil her side of the story.\n\nFurious: Tori was left fuming with the question, and later broke down in tears over the question\n\n'I was only four weeks pregnant when I found out while filming Bride and Prejudice,' she wrote.\n\n'The pregnancy came as a shock to both James and I, so yes I had been drinking beforehand as I didn't know I was pregnant!\n\n'When asked those questions at the dinner party about our pregnancy, I was so blown away and angry that anyone could ask that, but more so that production allowed the questions in at all.\n\n'We weren't ready to talk about it as we were only five weeks along at the time. We were told there was no heartbeat and bub was not even coming up on a scan.'\n\nContinuing the lengthy statement, she added: 'No guys, I don't drink while pregnant! I have a beautiful happy baby girl growing inside of me. So thank you everyone for your concern.'", "description": "A Bride and Prejudice star hit breaking point on Sunday night's episode.", "authors": ["Nicole Douglas For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/10/20240156-0-image-a-18_1572172843230.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
