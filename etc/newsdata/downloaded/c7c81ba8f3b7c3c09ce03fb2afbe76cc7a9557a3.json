But You Might Not Live Long Enough to See It.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nWill the world ever be free of fossil fuels? That\u2019s been a topic of much discussion in the runup to Climate Week, a United Nations-sponsored event that begins on Monday.\n\nRenewable energy, such as solar and wind power, is now a bigger generator of U.S. electricity than coal, despite pushback against renewables from the Trump administration, which last week said it would end California\u2019s ability to limit vehicle emissions. The Golden State\u2019s rules, which encourage production of electric and hybrid cars, are stricter than federal regulations, which the White House wants to loosen.\n\nWhat happens to oil still stirs the markets, as the recent attack on Saudi production facilities shows. Nonetheless, carbon-free investing\u2019s clout is growing. Last week, 200 institutional investors, which oversee $6.5 trillion in assets, called on 47 big publicly traded corporations to align their lobbying with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate, saying that \u201cunabated climate change will negatively impact our clients, plan beneficiaries, and the value of our portfolios.\u201d\n\nA recent Deutsche Bank study of 1,600 companies in the MSCI World index showed that, over the past 20 years, the stocks of those releasing \u201cpositive\u201d news about their climate footprint outpaced those of companies that didn\u2019t. And over the past year, low-carbon-footprint exchange-traded funds have been hard at the heels of the surging U.S. market: While SPY has risen more than 21% this year, the iShares and SPDR exchange traded funds (tickers: CRBN, LOWC) based on the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target index are both up 19%-plus.\n\nFossil fuels won\u2019t disappear tomorrow. The International Energy Agency doesn\u2019t see world oil demand or production peaking before 2040. That doesn\u2019t surprise Ian Simm, CEO of London-based Impax Asset Management (IPX.UK). Impax manages $18.5 billion in assets, including the Pax World sustainable mutual funds, and is well-known for its water and resource investing.\n\nSimm notes that power generation, transportation, and heating each account for about a third of U.S. fossil-fuel use.\n\nFor power generation, says Simm, renewables\u2019 costs have slid so sharply that \u201cyou could rationally say that by the 2030s, we could be fossil-fuel free.\u201d\n\nHowever, while transportation \u201ctechnology is just about there, it will take until the 2040s\u2026to get costs down,\u201d so that electric vehicles are as cheap as internal-combustion cars, buses, and trucks. There\u2019s also the legacy-asset issue; just about every American drives a gasoline-powered vehicle now, many of which will last another 10 or 20 years.\n\nHeating poses the biggest challenge because \u201cthe cost of alternatives is very high. The two basic options are electricity and hydrogen,\u201d Simm remarks. \u201cMost electricity still comes from fossil fuels, and we\u2019re struggling to replace them for non-heat electricity loads. Hydrogen either comes from electricity,\u201d as ions are decomposed, or from methane reform, a chemical process that produces hydrogen from methane, using a catalyst. The latter produces lots of carbon dioxide. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to capture and store CO2, but this is very expensive,\u201d Simm says.\n\nUpshot? A fossil fuel-free world might not materialize in your lifetime. Still, plenty of people\u2014and companies\u2014will be reducing their carbon footprints, creating investment opportunities, Simm says. He won\u2019t name names, but the stocks held by the Pax Global Environmental Markets fund (PGINX) include Linde (LIN), Waste Management (WM), and Siemens (SIE.Germany).\n\nWrite to Leslie P.
