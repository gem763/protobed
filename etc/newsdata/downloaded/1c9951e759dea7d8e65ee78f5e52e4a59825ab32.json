When Baldwin, his wife, Hilaria, and their children were escorted to a shuttle bus to New Jersey, he pulled the plug on the trip.\n\n\"So, we head to South Ferry. Me and @hilariabaldwin Two sharp, savvy NYers. Kids in tow. We buy the tickets for the 'boat tour' of the Statue of Liberty. We are escorted to a shuttle bus. To New Jersey! I kid you not. We paid. Then we read the tickets. NO ON EVER MENTIONED NEW F***ING JERSEY!!! This is a scam. Take the SI Ferry. It's the best ride in NY.\"", "description": "Native New Yorker Alec Baldwin got scammed by a ticket seller in New York City.", "authors": ["Marianne Garvey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181102113538-alec-baldwin-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
