Comey. Free from the threat of prosecution by the legal system for which he once stood, the fired former FBI director has validated the hoary adage that it\u2019s better to be lucky than good.\n\nMake that validated once again: Thanks to his ministrations, Hillary Clinton proved the point as well. In 2016, she dodged the dock when the Department of Justice declined to charge her for the mishandling of classified documents while secretary of State. Both forsook the good by breaking the rules binding the behavior of government officials and, as luck would have it, both escaped punishment.\n\nIn an 83-page report released Thursday, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded that while leading the FBI in 2017, Mr. Comey violated bureau protocols when he memorialized his conversations with President Trump on sensitive subjects related to allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. He then secreted them to a friend for the purpose of leaking them to the media and triggering the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the president.\n\nThe unrepentant Mr. Comey claimed vindication, of a sort, in the fact that he was not nailed on a charge that could have put him in prison pinstripes: \u201cDOJ IG \u2018found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media,\u2019\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u2018sorry we lied about you\u2019 would be nice.\u201d\n\nNot to have leaked classified material while screwing up in lesser ways is a little like a driver managing to avoid a pedestrian while speeding through a red light. The inspector general\u2019s report took a rather dim view of the former FBI director\u2019s actions: \u201cBy not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees \u2014 and the many thousands more former FBI employees \u2014 who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information,\u201d wrote Mr. Horowitz in his summary conclusion. The details of the Comey report had earlier been turned over to the FBI and Justice Department and \u2014 surprise \u2014 as in the case of Mrs. Clinton, the powers that be decided to abstain from prosecution.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s investigation focused on seven memos referencing several meetings in which Mr. Comey claimed the president sought to interfere with his duties \u2014 asking the director for loyalty on one occasion and on another, urging him to drop an FBI probe of fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nScapegoating is a favorite pastime in the nation\u2019s capital, and it\u2019s not uncommon for policy players to protect themselves from blame with records of their deeds when things go south. But funneling the president\u2019s thoughts to The New York Times constitutes an epic error in judgment unbecoming for the nation\u2019s top G-man.\n\nIn addition to breaking FBI policy by leaking the documents, Mr. Comey failed to inform the FBI on numerous occasions following his firing that he had kept his memos and disclosed them to other persons. Given his \u201cunauthorized disclosure of sensitive law enforcement information,\u201d as Mr. Horowitz terms Mr. Comey\u2019s scheming, it appears that the tallest Boy Scout in Washington is not so high-minded after all.\n\nThe nation\u2019s tale that plays out on the Washington stage is sometimes characterized by tragedy and other times by comedy. It is dramatic irony, though, that now links Mr. Comey\u2019s story with that of Mrs. Clinton. As FBI chief, Mr. Comey laid out in 2016 all the transgressions the then-Democratic presidential candidate had chalked up in storing highly classified government secrets on an unsecure home server, then declined to charge her with a crime. Now fate has somehow returned the favor, allowing Mr. Comey to escape the consequences of similar, though perhaps less egregious, failures.\n\nPoetic justice was the Bard of Avon\u2019s point when composing in \u201cKing Lear\u201d: \u201cThe wheel has come full circle.\u201d In the scene, a villain pays for his treachery with his life. Cutting to the drama on the Potomac, an act of justice denied has been rewarded in kind. Americans are left wondering when the wheel of fortune will get back on track.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
