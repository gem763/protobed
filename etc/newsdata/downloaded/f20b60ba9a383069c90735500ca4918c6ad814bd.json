The flag negated a sack of Aaron Rodgers that might have sealed Green Bay\u2019s fifth straight loss to the Lions and instead led to Allen Lizard\u2019s 35-yard TD catch that made it 22-20.\n\nThe second one came on a third-down incompletion by Rodgers which would have forced the Packers to kick a field goal with about 90 seconds left, plenty of time for Detroit to respond with its own field goal drive. Instead, the Packers ran the clock down to 2 seconds before Mason Crosby kicked the game-winning 23-yarder as time expired, then did his very first Lambeau Leap.\n\nFlowers, who had never been whistled for hands-to-the-face fouls in his five-year NFL career, said he was using the same move all game, putting his hands on left tackle David Bhaktiari\u2019s chest, not his neck or face.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think hands to the chest was a penalty,\u201d Flowers said.\n\nReferee Clete Blakeman said each of the calls was made by umpire Jeff Rice, and he discussed the last one with him.\n\n\u201cBasically, it\u2019s for illegal use of the hands, hands-to-the-face foul,\u201d Blakeman told a pool reporter. \u201cTo be a foul, we basically need some forceful contact that\u2019s prolonged to the head and neck area of the defender.\n\n\u201cSo, in his mind he had pinned him back, it was prolonged, and that\u2019s what created the foul.\u201d\n\nThe Lions tried to let the Packers score a touchdown after Flower\u2019s second flag so Matthew Stafford would have time to drive Detroit downfield, but Jamaal Williams wisely took a seat the 3 to allow the clock to keep ticking away.\n\nMonday Night Football analyst Booger McFarland complained about the first call on Flowers and was even more critical of the second one, saying, \u201cyou basically end the game on what I call a bogus hands-to-the-face.\u201d\n\nSocial media was abuzz over the frivolous flags.\n\n\u201cThe referees are destroying the NFL game by game,\u201d tweeted ex-NFL star Matt Forte . \u201cIt\u2019s a shame because of how much work is put in and to have games literally won or loss by bad calls in crucial situations.\u201d\n\nBarry Sanders chimed in , tweeting, \u201cThat is sickening\u2026 the @NFL needs to look at a way to prevent that from happening. Two phantom hands to the face calls really hurts us tonight. Yes, we could have scored TDs, but @Lions played too well to have the game end this way.\u201d\n\nInstead of leaving Lambeau Field atop the NFC North at 3-1-1, the Lions limped out 2-2-1 in last place while the Packers improved to 5-1.\n\nOther notable Week 6 calls included:\n\nBAILEY\u2019S BULLHORN\n\nChamp Bailey was honored at halftime in Denver for his Hall of Fame induction last summer and his induction into the Broncos\u2019 Ring of Fame. After a ceremony Friday night in which his 8-foot bronze pillar was unveiled, Bailey spoke about the positive feedback he\u2019s gotten for bringing up race relations in his Hall of Fame speech in Canton, Ohio.\n\n\u201cIt feels good because any time you have a platform like that you want to use it the right way,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cYou want to make sure you take advantage of the opportunity, let people know how you feel, what\u2019s important to me, what\u2019s on your mind and I think it\u2019s only fitting to do it when millions of people are watching you.\u201d\n\nONTO KANSAS CITY\n\nAfter recording his 20th career interception Sunday against Tennessee, Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. dedicated it to his mentor and said he\u2019d give the ball to Bailey.\n\nHarris was also asked about Chargers receiver Keenan Allen\u2019s dismissive comments about Harris last week after the Broncos star cornerback was primarily responsible for checkmating the league\u2019s top receiver in Denver\u2019s 20-13 win.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve locked him up numerous times. I don\u2019t even know how many times I\u2019ve shut him down,\u201d Harris shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to really talk about with him. I\u2019m ready for Tyreek Hill.\u201d\n\nAllen took to social media to voice his displeasure over his stat line against Denver, commenting on an Instagram post of a Chris Harris Jr. fan account, \u201cNow, y\u2019all know damn well that boy can\u2019t hold my jockstrap. Stop it.\u201d\n\nAllen confirmed those comments in the locker room Thursday, suggesting reporters \u201cjust watch the tape\u201d for proof.\n\nUnless that tape was replaced, it showed the Allen, the league\u2019s leader in catches and receiving yards, catching a season-low four passes on six targets for a measly 18 yards on a day the Chargers failed to score an offensive touchdown.\n\nCRAZY KICKOFF\n\nRavens coach John Harbaugh says the NFL has deemed illegal the kickoff dropkick that Justin Tucker used against Kansas City last month with Baltimore trailing 33-28 with 2:01 remaining in a Week 3 game. Harbaugh said the league told him it was legal when he raised the plan with NFL headquarters before using it.\n\n\u201cWe were in contact with the league officiating office all the way through ,\u201d Harbaugh said, via the Ravens Twitter account. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just pull it out, and decide to try it, and sneak it past them.\u201d\n\nNO JOKE\n\nJets safety Jamal Adams, who called the NFL \u201ca damn joke\u201d after he was fined $21,056 for a hit on Browns QB Baker Mayfield in Week 2, won his appeal and relished in the victory that came just before the Jets\u2019 first real win of the season, over the Cowboys.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy that won\u2019t be taken out (of my paycheck) because now I can spend that lovely money on my mother for her birthday,\u201d Adams told reporters Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m excited about that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Another frustrating weekend of flag-filled football culminated with the Packers' 23-22 last-second win over the Lions on Monday night thanks to two phantom hands-to-the-face calls on Detroit defensive end Trey Flowers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/lions_packers_football_50979_c0-178-4280-2674_s1200x700.jpg?32a6a94ff1f483d76ae4706d373e2b285dbe1def", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
