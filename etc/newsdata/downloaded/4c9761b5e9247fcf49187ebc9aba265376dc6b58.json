Forecasters expect Dorian's center to move over or near North Carolina's coast overnight and Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina officials said more than 440,000 people evacuated coastal areas. Flash floods did not overwhelm Charleston as much as anticipated, but Georgetown, Horry County and other areas north of the city will probably get more water, Gov. Henry McMaster said.\n\n\"It is still a very dangerous storm,\" McMaster said Thursday afternoon. \"It is impossible to predict exactly where it is going to go and what is going to happen.\"\n\nHow to get involved: Havoc in the Bahamas. Here's how you can help.\n\nThe center of the storm was forecast to continue moving over or near North Carolina's coast, then weaken as it moves near the southeastern tip of New England on Friday night and Saturday morning.\n\nThe Outer Banks \u2013 the thin line of islands that stick out from North Carolina's coast \u2013 are particularly at risk, forecasters warned.\n\nNational Guardsmen check on Bay Tree subdivision in Little River, near North Myrtle Beach, S.C. after a tornado from Hurricane Dorian damaged the area on Sept. 5, 2019.

Gusts almost as strong were recorded elsewhere in the state and in North Carolina, the hurricane center said.\n\nSeveral tornadoes were sighted in the area, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 60 miles from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extended up to 200 miles.\n\n\"People have to realize it\u2019s not just about the center\" of the storm, said Ken Graham, director of the hurricane center. \"You have to look at the whole storm.\u201d\n\nYou may like: 6-year-old boy uses money saved for Disney to help Dorian evacuees\n\nParts of North Carolina could see 7 feet of storm surge, he said. Anything above 3 feet is considered life-threatening, according to the hurricane center.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just going to continue to get more and more rain, so you\u2019re going to get more street flooding, and some of the rivers could flood, as well,\u201d Graham said.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said the state opened more than 50 shelters and prepped more than 20 swift water rescue teams. Sixteen aircraft were at the ready.\n\nIn Wrightsville Beach, several people were charged with Class 2 misdemeanors after failing to comply with evacuation orders, Police Chief Daniel House said.\n\n\"You certainly put first responders at risk and your own life at risk if you decided to stay, particularly on a barrier island,\" Cooper said. \"If they have not evacuated at this point, I'd get to the safest place I possibly could.\"\n\nCooper said a man fell to his death from a ladder while preparing his Columbus County home for the storm. At least 20 deaths in the Bahamas have been linked to Dorian.\n\nIn Charleston, at the corner of Calhoun and Washington streets near the state aquarium, John Rivers and daughters, Martha and Caroline, and son, Minott, raked tree debris out of storm drains.\n\n\"The city is doing the best job they can, but they can't be everywhere at every drain, so we're helping them out,\" Rivers said as the winds and rain carried debris down the street.\n\nWithin minutes, a pool of stormwater that stretched across Washington Street was drained away.\n\n\"It's a teachable moment for them, and they're also very civic-minded,\" Rivers said. \"My family has been here since 1670, so it's time for us to pitch in.\"\n\nIn North Litchfield Beach, about 60 miles northeast of Charleston, some sections of the residential streets appeared to be under two feet or so of water.\n\n'Total devastation. Apocalyptic': Massive rescue effort in Bahamas\n\nOn North Carolina's Outer Banks, winds picked up, skies began to gray and roads cleared in the towns of Kill Devil Hills and Nags Head. Locals fished and walked along the beach. By midafternoon Thursday, residents who elected to stay despite evacuation orders retreated to boarded-up homes.\n\nDerek Bellinger and his family stayed despite the evacuation order. Bellinger said they stockpiled four cases of water, enough food to fill a freezer and 25 gallons of gas to power a generator. He said they were not leaving \u2013 and he was not too worried about Dorian.\n\n\"We've done our prep and have been here through many, many storms,\" Bellinger said. \"We're just kind of hunkered down.\"\n\nCarol Ann Angelos, owner of the beachside restaurant The Jolly Roger for 35 years, said that unless she loses power, her restaurant will stay open. She said she expects to serve emergency responders \u2013 sandwiches by candlelight if she loses power.\n\nJolly Roger's windows were boarded up, but the signs said \"OPEN.\"\n\n\"I mean, your entire livelihood is here,\" Angelos said. \"You do sandbags, you board up your windows, you tie everything down and you pray that ocean doesn't come over and flood you.\"\n\nJon Hildebrand, 59, evacuated from a home he owns in Kitty Hawk in the Outer Banks to a hotel in Elizabeth City, roughly an hour away. He journeyed to a Hampton Inn along with his wife and his daughter \u2013 who had already been evacuated from Coastal Carolina University in Conway, S.C.\n\nSitting in the lobby of the Hampton Inn, surrounded by classwork she still needs to get done, Rachel Hildebrand, a 21-year-old Coastal Carolina senior, said she was first told to leave campus Sunday via email.\n\n\"This is my fourth time in my college career being evacuated for a hurricane,\" she said. \"It's just super annoying, really. I thought I was fine going to the Outer Banks because at first, when I got evacuated on Sunday, it wasn't really supposed to come up this far. Now, it's hitting almost exactly where our house is. It's a little frustrating.\"\n\nBacon reported from McLean, Virginia.; Culver from Kill Devil Hills and Elizabeth City, North Carolina.
