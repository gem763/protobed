Not this,\u201d said Coralee Steele, 40, one of their many ardent fans.\n\nOnline, the Canadian rock band is shorthand for conservative white guys in trucker hats who still hate the ex they broke up with four years ago; and so, despite them not having released a record in two years, the internet is brimming with Nickelback memes.\n\nOne such meme was circulated by Trump on Wednesday, in an apparent attempt to shift attention away from ongoing impeachment proceedings against him.\n\n\u201cLOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH\u201d he tweeted, referencing a famous Nickelback song, alongside a video promoting discredited corruption claims against Democratic candidate Joe Biden.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH! pic.twitter.com/QQYTqG4KTt\n\nThe video has since been taken off Twitter at the band\u2019s request due to copyright infringement, but it has been causing a stir with Nickelback fans.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s tweet late on Wednesday, the NickelbackFans Facebook page, which has more than 30,000 followers, posted: \u201cI never believed I would say this but thank you Mr President for making Nickelback trending in the US!\u201d\n\nSteele was upset to see that the band\u2019s name was popular again \u2013 only to be the butt of some online joke. \u201cI\u2019m tired of seeing them being used as a joke, they don\u2019t deserve it nor does anyone else,\u201d she told the Guardian.\n\nLifelong Nickelback fan Paige Niccum, 26, agrees: \u201cSeeing other Nickelback fans celebrate the attention annoyed me. This is not what Nickelback would want,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Niccum, the problem is political. She refers to herself as \u201c100% Democrat, blue through and through\u201d and says she didn\u2019t like to see the Republican president use her favorite band for political gain.\n\nShe points to ocean conservation charities the band supports, as well as a rumored anti-Trump protest song of theirs, Feed the Machine, as reasons why she believes that they wouldn\u2019t support it either.\n\n\u201cThe minute I saw that Trump, the biggest bully of them all, making a Nickelback joke, it just sent my blood on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cI just thought, how dare you?\u201d\n\nNiccum worries people might begin to associate Nickelback with Trump because they look like the kind of band who might support him. So she was happy to see that the band had requested Trump take their song down.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be contributing to him trying to disregard the impeachment investigation that\u2019s currently going on.\u201d\n\nOthers seemed happy, at the surge in searches for the band since Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nSteven Ward, who runs the Nickelback Worldwide Twitter page, said he hoped it would bring the band some long-lasting popularity again.\n\n\u201cIn the last few years their albums sort of struggled. It\u2019s nice to see Nickelback back in the news,\u201d he said.", "description": "Fans of the Canadian rock band had mixed opinions after the US president tweeted a popular Nickelback meme", "authors": ["Poppy Noor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54f2f98aed729c5e7cd2a260f5c97c4f8d963524/0_34_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0eaa21846efbca46f2e6368c3b2aea82"}
