(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nAny Republican faculty member would be right to have concerns about getting a fair hearing with James Thomas at the helm.\n\nThe professor at the University of Mississippi who tweeted \u201cMAGA teens are modern day Hitlerjugend\u201d has landed a leadership spot on the chancellor\u2019s \u201cAcademic Freedom & Faculty Responsibility\u201d committee.\n\nAccording to an article in Campus Reform, the associate professor of sociology, James Thomas, tweeted that he had been elected chair of the committee in September. The role of the committee, naturally, is to handle issues related to faculty employment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically enough, Thomas has made headlines for tweeting some pretty irresponsible things in the past. For example, last October, Thomas declared that \u201cMAGA teens are modern day Hitlerjugend. Got a uniform and everything\u201d \u2014 and, to remove any misconception that he might be joking, he tweeted: \u201cWhen I said MAGA teens are modern day Hitlerjugend, I meant it. What we\u2019re watching at this rally is the aesthetics of fascism.\u201d\n\nThat same month, Thomas also encouraged people to harass U.S. senators, tweeting: \u201cDon\u2019t just interrupt a Senator\u2019s meal, y\u2019all. Put your whole damn fingers in their salads. Take their [appetizers] and distribute them to the other diners. Bring boxes and take their food home with you on the way out. They don\u2019t deserve your civility.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, let me just say that I am all for free speech. In fact, I\u2019m an absolutist: I am so grateful that we live in a country where we have those rights, where Thomas can actually tweet things like that and not face any legal repercussions. Sure, I may think that his comments were stupid, uninformed, offensive, and incorrect \u2014 but I would still defend his right to say them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being said, though, they were still stupid, uninformed, offensive, and incorrect. Comparing Trump\u2019s supporters to Hitler\u2019s is offensive \u2014 not only to those supporters, but also to anyone who has ever been impacted by Hitler\u2019s cruelty. Say what you will about Trump, but none of his transgressions exactly hold a candle to those of someone who literally exterminated millions of Jews.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Thomas\u2019s extreme views on this subject do raise the question of whether he would actually even be able to do a job on the \u201cAcademic Freedom & Faculty Responsibility\u201d committee fairly. This committee, after all, is tasked with conducting \u201chearings, when such are required in cases involving the dismissal or termination of tenured faculty, the non-renewal of a contract for a non-tenured faculty member when there is a substantial claim that such action violates academic freedom or equal employment rights, or the dismissal of a non-tenured faculty member prior to the expiration of a term appointment.\u201d\n\nIn other words? Thomas is going to be the chairman of the body deciding who does and does not get to work at the University of Mississippi. Given the fact that he has repeatedly said that he equates Trump support to Nazism, any Republican faculty member would be right to have concerns about whether he or she could ever hope to get a fair hearing with Thomas at the helm. The threat of job loss due to this might even prompt some conservative employees (assuming, of course, that there even are any) to stay silent about their views \u2014 which would be a pretty ironic outcome to result from an appointment to a committee that\u2019s also supposed to be tasked with protecting \u201cacademic freedom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain: Thomas had every right to say what he said, but that doesn\u2019t mean that his words shouldn\u2019t be taken into account when considering him for an appointment. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I do kind of feel like the ideal candidate to head a committee that\u2019s in charge of all faculty members\u2019 employment wouldn\u2019t be someone who has openly professed hatred for people of a certain political party \u2014 and that the ideal candidate for the head of a committee that\u2019s supposed to protect academic freedom wouldn\u2019t be someone whose very presence there may threaten it.", "description": "Given the fact that professor James Thomas has repeatedly said that he equates Trump support to Nazism, any Republican faculty member would be right to have concerns about whether he or she could ever hope to get a fair hearing with Thomas at the helm.", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf", "David French", "Matthew Continetti", "Brian Stewart", "John Fund", "George Will", "Jack Crowe", "Jonah Goldberg", "Kyle Smith", "Rich Lowry"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/donald-trump-duluth-rally.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
