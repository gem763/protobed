REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe New York Times said Trump had asked Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for the help, in hopes of discrediting Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s campaign to aid Trump in winning the 2016 national election.\n\nAn Australian government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the two leaders spoke by telephone in September.\n\nTrump\u2019s request, however, was preceded by an Australian offer of help, with its ambassador to the United States, Joe Hockey, writing to U.S. Attorney-General William Barr in May to offer Canberra\u2019s assistance.\n\n\u201cThe Australian government will use its best endeavors to support your efforts in this matter,\u201d Hockey wrote in a May 28 letter, referring to Trump\u2019s May 24 announcement of plans to investigate the origins of the FBI investigation.\n\nTrump is under mounting pressure amid an impeachment investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives into reports that he sought to influence foreign governments to go after his political adversaries.\n\nThe Democratic-led House began the inquiry last week after a whistleblower raised concerns that Trump tried to leverage nearly $400 million in proposed aid for Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nWhile the impeachment investigation threatens Trump\u2019s grip on power, his standing with voters remains soured by the Mueller report, which was triggered by former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer.\n\nDowner was allegedly told in 2016 by George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign aide, that Russia had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nDowner reported the details of the conversation, which Papadopoulos denies, to the FBI.\n\n(This story has been refiled to fix spelling of \u201cMueller\u201d in headline, text)", "description": "Australia offered assistance in May for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s investigation of the origins of a damning report about Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a letter reviewed by Reuters shows.", "authors": ["Colin Packham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435722242&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901SS", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
