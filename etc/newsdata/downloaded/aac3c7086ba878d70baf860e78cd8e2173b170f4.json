That\u2019s because this is a critical period for many investors and companies that manage performance to calendar year-end. So how can you best take advantage of the current investing climate? One option is to turn to value stocks. Luckily Goldman Sachs has released a report revealing its top value stocks right now. According to the firm, these are stocks that \"have the potential for continued asymmetric upside.\"\n\n\"While fundamentals will also determine the long-term trajectory of stocks, we use signals from options and credit markets to identify 20 value stocks from among those where our analysts' estimates show strong value scores,\" the firm\u2019s Vishal Vivek told clients recently. These are stocks that sold off over the last year, but are now showing strong rebound potential.\n\nHere we ran the 20 stocks recommended by the firm through our database to find the 5 stocks on the list with the most Street support. Indeed, as you will see below, all five stocks covered below show a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 or \u2018Moderate Buy\u2019 consensus from Wall Street. This is based on all the ratings received by each stock over the last three months- and means analysts believe now is a compelling time to buy into these names. Let\u2019s take a closer look:\n\n1. Marathon Petroleum\n\nBased in Ohio, Marathon Petroleum (MPC \u2013 Get Report) is a leading downstream energy company. The company operates the US\u2019s largest refining system 3 million + barrels per day of crude oil capacity across 16 refineries. Five out of six analysts covering Marathon are bullish on the stock\u2019s outlook. And the average analyst price target works out at $68 (23% upside potential). Encouragingly, MPC\u2019s 2Q19 results came in strong across the board. Plus synergies from its Andeavor acquisition are starting to come through more rapidly. Achieving a $1.4 billion synergy target would be a major catalyst says RBC Capital\u2019s Brad Heffern.\n\nHe is also a fan of Marathon\u2019s retail business, Speedway. This \u201cis the most attractive retail franchise in our coverage universe, and the extension of the Speedway model to the acquired ANDV stores could provide meaningful upside\u201d stated the analyst. Even though the stock is trading down 7% year-to-date, shares have rallied 12% since the start of September.\n\n2. Morgan Stanley\n\nAll four analysts covering Morgan Stanley (MS \u2013 Get Report) rate the stock a buy right now. On average these analysts see shares climbing 37% from current levels. Most tellingly, Citigroup\u2019s Keith Horowitz recently upgraded MS from Hold to Buy while boosting his price target from $48 to $52. He advised investors to use weakness as an opportunity to increase exposure to a high-quality franchise with limited rates exposure.", "description": "October is set to be a particularly volatile month for the market.
