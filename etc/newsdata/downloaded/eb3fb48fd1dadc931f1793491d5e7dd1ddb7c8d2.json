But Chris Noth, a long time ago, he was out with a friend of his. We met and I thought, \u2018God, this guy\u2019s really very interesting.\u2019 But he had a girlfriend.\u201d\n\n'SEX AND THE CITY' AUTHOR CANDACE BUSHNELL REGRETS NOT HAVING KIDS, SAYS SHE WAS 'TRULY ALONE'\n\n\u201cAnd then I went to a party \u2014 he was single and I was single, and this was a couple of years ago, and we started talking and we hit it off. And so we started dating,\u201d the best-selling author continued. \u201cI think we were maybe on our third date when Chris Noth called\u2026 He was like, \u2018Bushnell, I can\u2019t believe it, you\u2019re going out with one of my best friends!\u2019 So I can never get away from Mr. Big.\u201d\n\nThe best-selling author, whose book would inspire the hit HBO series starring Sarah Jessica Parker, recently released \u201cIs There Still Sex and the City?\u201d. Her newest book follows a group of female friends as they navigate midlife dating and relationships in New York City. Like with her first book, Bushnell draws from her own personal experience.\n\nSARAH JESSICA PARKER CLAIMS 'BIG MOVIE STAR' BEHAVED 'INAPPROPRIATELY' ON 'SEX AND THE CITY' SET\n\nBut we couldn\u2019t help but wonder: Can women today still relate to \u201cSex and the City\u201d? Absolutely, said Bushnell. Like a pair of Manolos, Bushnell said her original tale will never go out of style.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not too dated for women to enjoy and it\u2019s still a huge hit,\u201d she explained. \u201cReally, girls in their late teens and women in their 20s come up to me and they watch it, they binge-watch it. I think that it\u2019s almost really like a rite of passage. And the fact is that they still really relate to it because even though people maybe ghost you today, and there are all different terms, being broken up with is still being broken up with.\u201d\n\nSARAH JESSICA PARKER SAYS 'SEX AND THE CITY' WAS 'SUFFOCATING'\n\n\u201cSo the emotions are still the same and so it does still very much resonate, I find, with young women,\u201d Bushnell continued. \u201cAnd I found that [my new book] is also resonating with young women as well because they\u2019re interested in seeing what life really is like. As opposed to, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s the fairy tale?\u2019 Because young women today know that the fairy tale isn\u2019t really that true.\u201d\n\nOne of the subjects Bushnell tackles in her book is a subject that has made its way on social media and reality TV shows \u2014 getting work done in hopes of turning back time.\n\nCYNTHIA NIXON THINKS IF 'SEX AND THE CITY' WERE MADE NOW IT WOULDN'T FEATURE AN ALL-WHITE CAST: 'GOD FORBID'\n\nThe New York Post previously reported Bushnell nearly shelled out thousands of dollars for the Mona Lisa, or \u201ca vaginal laser-rejuvenation treatment that has become a cultish obsession among the city\u2019s most privileged.\u201d\n\nBut readers shouldn\u2019t expect any less from Bushnell, who was just as frank with us as she was in her New York Observer column titled \u201cSex and the City,\u201d which resulted in the series that aired from 1998 until 2004.\n\nSARAH JESSICA PARKER SAYS 'SEX AND THE CITY' WAS \u2018SUFFOCATING\u2019: 'IT FELT LIKE SOMEBODY WAS HOLDING ME HOSTAGE'\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s pressure on everybody to look younger,\u201d said Bushnell. \u201cAnd there certainly is pressure on 50-something, 60-something and 70-something women to look younger. Part of that is because we can\u2026 In the past, we just didn\u2019t have these tools, and people do take advantage of them. What\u2019s interesting is how many young women do Botox and plastic surgery.\n\n\u201cSo the reality is if we have tools to make us look younger, there are many people who will take advantage of these methods and techniques. And that, in turn, feels like it puts pressure on everybody else\u2026 But the interesting thing about middle age is that there\u2019s also freedom where there\u2019s an acceptance\u2026 So there are both sides to that coin.\u201d\n\nBut those expecting a new \u201cSex and The City\u201d film shouldn\u2019t hold their breath.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn November 2018, Parker told Fox News that while she knows the next chapter to the popular franchise, it may not be available any time soon.\n\n\u201cI know where it is,\u201d said the 54-year-old at the time about where she saw \u201cSex and the City\u201d and its heroine heading. \u201cI read the script. It\u2019s fantastic\u2026 It was great, it was beautiful. But I sadly can\u2019t say. But I know where [Carrie] was headed and I know where all [the characters] were headed. It was wonderful.\u201d", "description": "\u201cSex and the City\u201d creator Candace Bushnell says it was Chris Noth, who famously played Mr. Big in the hit HBO series, who introduced her to Mr. Bigger.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/30/694940094001_6080572883001_6080598467001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
