That Curry was named man of the match, and Underhill cannot have been far behind, tells its own story.\n\nThey made 40 tackles between them. Both delivered momentum-shifting hits at key moments amid periods of Australian dominance. Underhill made a big turnover. Curry set up England\u2019s crucial first try.\n\nHooper and Pocock were outplayed, the latter in what proved to be the final test match of his illustrious career.\n\n\u201cThey are the players for many back-rowers coming through that you really look at analyzing,\u201d Curry said after the match. \u201cThey set a real benchmark.\u201d\n\nNow the benchmark is being set by England\u2019s young tyros.\n\nCurry is just 21, the youngest forward ever to represent England at a World Cup, and has an identical twin in Ben. Both play at Sale Sharks, the top-flight rugby team in Manchester, yet their careers could have taken a different turn, with both earning trials at English soccer giant Manchester City when 13 years old.\n\nUnderhill is 23, injury-prone, and an amateur guitar player - a \u201ccampfire wannabe,\u201d in his own words. Four years ago, and a student in Cardiff at the time, he was the only Englishman in a Welsh bar as Wales beat England at Twickenham to dump the World Cup host out of the tournament in the pool stage.\n\nNow, \u201cSlammin\u2019 Sam\u201d is one of the players leading England\u2019s recovery as a rugby force.\n\nOne noticeable thing about their combination in the England team is that both are genuine No. 7s, hard-working scavengers very much in the Pocock mold.\n\nRewind to the 2015 World Cup and England played with two No. 6s in Chris Robshaw and James Haskell, something Eddie Jones - Japan coach back then and now in charge of England - believed held the English team back. They were sometimes described as \u201c6\u00bds\u201d but didn\u2019t have the marauding qualities of typical opensides.\n\nUpon becoming England coach after that World Cup, Jones went about searching for No. 7s of the future with the help of age-grade coaches, with this World Cup in Japan very much in mind.\n\nThe result? \u201cThe Kamikaze Kids,\u201d as Jones has labeled his young flankers.\n\nUnderhill made 20 tackles against Australia, the most destructive being the one that cut down Wallabies No. 8 Isi Naisarani at waist height midway through the first half as Australia looked to continue its bright start.\n\nThe flow of the game quickly changed, and with England now in good field position after an Australia knock-on, Curry sent over the pass that winger Jonny May took to score England\u2019s go-ahead try.\n\nCurry chopped down Australia winger Reece Hodge in center-field and then Naisarani near England\u2019s tryline in two other stand-out moments at the Oita Stadium.\n\n\u201cYou play rugby for the physicality,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWhen you get moments like that, it\u2019s special.\u201d\n\nUnderhill felt sad, in one way, that he\u2019d sent Pocock into retirement, saying he was \u201ca guy you want to be and play like.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a bit surreal coming up against him,\u201d Underhill said. \u201cTom and myself were talking about it, he\u2019s been such a brilliant player.\u201d\n\nSo, now the \u201cPooper\u201d era is over, is it the time of \u201cCunderhill\u201d or \u201cUndercurry\u201d, Curry was asked.\n\n\u201cCut that straight in the bud, that is not happening,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are terrible names. Horrible!\u201d\n\nHowever they are labeled, Curry and Underhill might be dominating the thoughts of New Zealand, England\u2019s opponent in the semifinals in Yokohama on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "They are called \"The Kamikaze Kids\" by their coach, such is the disregard Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have for their own well-being.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
