All 26 people aboard who survived were injured, and were taken to various hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe Highway Patrol said 12 to 15 people on the bus were critically injured. Dastrup said seven victims were initially listed as critical, and four of them were evacuated to hospitals by helicopter.\n\nShe said the passengers were all Mandarin Chinese speakers, and that county officials put out a call for Mandarin speakers to go one of the local hospitals to assist in translation. The victims\u2019 nationalities had not been immediately determined, officials said.\n\nHighway Patrol spokesman Corporal Chris Bishop said the passengers were all believed to be from mainland China or Taiwan, as opposed to being U.S. residents.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty overwhelming for a little county of 4,900 people,\u201d Garfield County Commissioner Leland Pollock told KSL-TV, a local NBC affiliate station. \u201cThis is just horrible for us, and we feel terrible for those who are injured and their families.\u201d\n\nBishop said that based on the number of critically injured victims, it was possible the death toll would rise.\n\nA 14-mile (23 km) stretch of highway around the crash site was shut in both directions as authorities began investigating the cause of the accident, and it likely will remain closed \u201cfor some time,\u201d Bishop said.\n\nBryce Canyon National Park, best known for its spired, multi-hued rock formations called hoodoos, remained open to visitors, though traffic to the park was restricted.\n\nWhile all inbound routes to Bryce Canyon from the north, south and west pass were blocked by the crash site on SR-12, alternate routes from the west were still open, park spokesman Peter Densmore said.\n\nAt the time of the crash, Dastrup said, the bus was headed toward Bryce Canyon, located about 270 miles (435 km) south of Salt Lake City, and skies were clear.\n\nThe national park, occupying 55 square miles (14,245 hectares) of southern Utah, attracts some 2 million visitors a year.", "description": "A bus carrying Chinese-speaking tourists careened off a road and crashed near Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah on Friday, killing at least four people and critically injuring at least another 12, authorities reported.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432150312&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J2CE", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
