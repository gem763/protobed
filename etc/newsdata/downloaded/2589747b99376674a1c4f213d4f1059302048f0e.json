Am I the a**hole?\"\n\nReddit users were quick to call the bride 'tacky and cheap'.\n\nOne said: \"There's nothing wrong with a cash bar at a wedding like this, but it is tacky to overcharge your guests and try to make a profit.\n\n\"I don't know if she's deliberately misinterpreted what her bridesmaid said or not.\n\n\"Also I hate when people brag about how little they spent only to find out that they did so because they got everything for free.\n\n\"She's still having a big expensive wedding, just at the cost of her friends free labour.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nOne user said: \"If you want a big wedding, don't be cheap. If you are cheap, elope.\"\n\nAnd another added: \"So you already saved tons and want the guests to pay for the \u00a32k you have spent? This is tacky as hell. How cheap can you get.\"", "description": "One user said the move was \"tacky as hell\" before asking \"how cheap can you get?\"", "authors": ["Grace Witherden", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566923.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bride-and-groom-making-a-toast-with-champagne.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
