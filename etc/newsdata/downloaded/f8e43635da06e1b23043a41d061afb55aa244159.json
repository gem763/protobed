But for the first time they have said no new money would flow until the government takes clear steps toward reforms it has long only promised.\n\nTheir hope is to see it move towards fixing a system that sectarian politicians have used to deploy state resources to their own advantage through patronage networks instead of building a functional state.\n\nA crisis could stoke further unrest in a country hosting some 1 million refugees from neighbouring Syria, where a Turkish incursion in the northeast this month has opened a new front in an eight-year war.\n\n\"If the situation remains, and there are no radical reforms, a devaluation of the currency is inevitable,\" said Toufic Gaspard, a former adviser to Lebanon's finance ministry and former economist at its central bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"Since September a new era has begun,\" he added. \"The red flags are large and everywhere, especially with the central bank paying up to 13% to borrow dollars.\"\n\nThe first reform on Beirut's agenda is one of the most intractable: fixing chronic power outages that make private generators a costly necessity, a problem many see as the main symbol of corruption that has left services unreliable and infrastructure crumbling.\n\nHariri, in a televised speech to the nation, said he had been struggling to reform the electricity sector ever since taking office. After \"meeting after meeting, committee after committee, proposal after proposal, I got at last to the final step and someone came and said 'it doesn't work',\" he said.\n\nPresenting the difficulties of implementing reform more widely, Hariri said every committee required a minimum of nine ministers to keep everyone happy.\n\n\"A national unity government? OK, we understand that. But committees of national unity? The result is that nothing works.\"\n\nUnderscoring the pressure from abroad, Pierre Duquesne, a French ambassador handling so-called CEDRE funding, is traveling to Lebanon next week to press the government on the use of offshore power barges, a banker familiar with the plan said.", "description": "Lebanon is closer to a financial crisis than at any time since at least the war-torn 1980s as allies, investors and this week nationwide protests pile pressure on the government to tackle a corrupt system and enact long-promised reforms.
