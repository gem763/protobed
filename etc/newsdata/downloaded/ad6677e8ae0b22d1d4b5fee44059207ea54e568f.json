(Laura Cooper/AP)\n\nA yak named Meteor escaped its owner on the way to the butcher this week and is on the loose somewhere in central Virginia.\n\nMeteor\u2019s owner told Nelson County animal control that the yak had kicked off the back door of a livestock trailer about 10 a.m. Tuesday at a stop sign in Lovingston, Va., about 40 miles southwest of Charlottesville.\n\nNelson County Animal Control Officer Kevin Wright said Friday that the search for Meteor continues. The animal initially retreated to the mountains but has since been seen on both sides of Route 29 near Lovingston.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of hanging close within a two- to three-mile circumference,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWhen he gets on 29, it\u2019s a public safety factor.\u201d\n\nThe News & Advance in Lynchburg was the first on Meteor\u2019s trail.\n\nRobert Cissell, Meteor\u2019s owner, said the yak is three years old and weighs about 600 pounds. He was raised on Cissell\u2019s farm in Buckingham, Va., and Cissell said he hopes to lure him back by placing a trap of sweet feed and apples in a trailer.\n\nCissell said yaks are able to survive for long periods without human supervision, pointing out that two survived for months in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. Meteor is worth more than $1,000 at market, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is how we make our living,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, for me, it\u2019s not the cute animal story everyone thinks,\u201d he said.\n\nLaura Cooper, a member service specialist with the Nelson County Farm Bureau, caught Meteor on camera when staff noticed the animal in the back of its office building.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just chilling,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to go where he was going.\u201d\n\nDeb Verplank, co-owner of the Orchard House Bed and Breakfast, where Cissell set his trap, said Meteor showed up on Wednesday like any other visitor.\n\n\u201cHe came up right up our driveaway, like he was home\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you see that kind of guest arriving for check-in.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to go where he was going,\u201d a witness said.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
