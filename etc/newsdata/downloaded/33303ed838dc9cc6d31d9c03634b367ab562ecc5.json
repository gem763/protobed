He said he would discuss the deployment of Syrian government forces in the safe zone during talks with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, next week, but warned Ankara would \u201cimplement its own plans\u201d if a solution was not reached.\n\nTrump has faced rare bipartisan criticism in the US for his surprise announcement this month that American troops would stand aside as Turkey mounted an operation to push US-backed Kurdish forces in Syria, its allies in the fight against Isis, at least 20 miles (32km) away from its southern border.\n\nThe US withdrawal, which led the Kurds to turn to Moscow to broker an agreement with the Syrian regime to protect them against the Turkish onslaught, has been described by Congress\u2019s most senior Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, as \u201ca grave mistake\u201d.\n\nFormer CIA director and retired US military general David Petraeus said on Sunday that the US had abandoned its Kurdish allies. \u201cThey took over 10,000 losses as the defeat of Islamic State was carried out, the elimination of the caliphate that Isis had,\u201d he told CNN.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a very sudden exit. And this does not end an endless war. It probably prolongs it, because this gives Isis an opportunity for a resurgence.\u201d\n\nNancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, at the weekend led a bipartisan congressional delegation to Jordan, a staunch US ally that contributed to the global coalition that defeated Islamic State in Syria, and met the country\u2019s ruler, King Abdullah II, on Saturday evening, to discuss the fallout from Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from neighbouring Syria.\n\nPelosi and other senior Democrats walked out of an acrimonious meeting with Trump over the issue last week and accused the president of having a \u201cmeltdown\u201d.\n\nIt is \u201ca critical time for the security and stability of the region\u201d, Pelosi said in a statement from Amman. \u201cWith the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey\u2019s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees and the dangerous opening that has been provided to Isis, Iran and Russia,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, US troops were seen on Sunday leaving a key base in northern Syria with their equipment, apparently part of a broad US withdrawal ordered by Trump.\n\nThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who had accompanied Pence to Turkey, said on Sunday he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the ceasefire. \u201cThere\u2019s relatively little fighting, a little sporadic small-arms fire, a mortar or two,\u201d he told ABC.\n\nErdo\u011fan unleashed the offensive against the Kurds on 9 October, agreeing to a pause after Pence and Pompeo rushed to Turkey amid mounting international outrage.\n\nThe Turkish defence ministry said on Sunday that one Turkish soldier was killed in an attack by Kurdish fighters in the Tal Abyad border area.\n\nThe Kurdish Red Crescent, a humanitarian group unaffiliated with the International Committee of the Red Cross, said 20 civilians had died and another 20 had been injured in attacks by Turkey or its allies since the start of the ceasefire.\n\nPelosi\u2019s unscheduled visit was in keeping with several overseas delegations led by the House that have highlighted gaps between the Trump administration\u2019s position and those held by Congress, including by many Republicans.\n\nIn April she visited the Irish border to warn about the risk of a hard Brexit threatening the Good Friday agreement, which the US helped to broker in 1998. Trump administration officials have said they would \u201centhusiastically\u201d back Britain leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nPelosi and other congressional leaders attended the Munich security conference in February, delivering reassuring messages to some of the European leaders whom Trump has accused of failing to contribute their share to Nato and the US-led campaign against Isis.\n\nPilots from Jordan took part in airstrikes as part of the US-led coalition against Isis, a role that became prominent after the capture and filmed murder of a Jordanian air force lieutenant, Muath al-Kasasbeh, by Isis militants.\n\nThere are thought to be up to 2,000 Jordanian members of Isis held in makeshift prisons across north-east Syria. The US continues to deploy troops at the al-Tanf base on the Syrian border with Jordan.\n\nA report by Petra News, Jordan\u2019s state-run news agency, said the king \u201cstressed the need to reach a political solution to the crisis that preserves the unity of Syria and its people and guarantees the voluntary and safe return of refugees\u201d.", "description": "Evacuation part of US-brokered ceasefire, as Nancy Pelosi leads congressional visit to region", "authors": ["Michael Safi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8251bcb4c6b98af267690996d37063a7578d8664/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3347a7ceebb8fa409217a42a32c5b8e9", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
