Why not keep their tattoos as a memorial?\"\n\nFrom bar banter chat over a beer, the 'Save My Ink Forever' service was born.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\nKyle explained the 'lengthy process' takes three to four months and is started within 72 hours of the person's death, with the tattoo being 'excised' at the funeral home.\n\nThey say the process doesn't interfere with traditional viewing or cremation and is done with the usual standard of dignity and respect - although they draw the line at preserving face and genital tattoos.\n\nThe good news for families who choose to hang the inkings on their walls is that there is 'no maintenance' and the skin should be treated 'as you would fine art'.\n\n'Save My Ink Forever' has received some backlash - with the pair even being compared to Ed Gein, a murderer notorious for making clothes and masks from his victim's bodies.\n\nMichael and Kyle instead focus on the wishes on the loved one's family, although they have had to knock back requests to make lamp shades and book covers from the skin.\n\n\"We are helping families and fulfilling their last wishes,\" Kyle added. \"We are not trying to create a freakshow.\"", "description": "A mortician is offering to turn tattoos into wall hangings for families after a loved one has passed", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Save My Ink Forever", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images Eyeem"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663791.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Save-My-Ink-Forever.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
