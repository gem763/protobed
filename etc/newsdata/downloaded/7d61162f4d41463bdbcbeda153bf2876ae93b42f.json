The Xi Jinping era has been disastrous for Chinese society, for China\u2019s foreign relations with much of the world, and particularly for cross-Strait relations.\n\nDespite the incomparable importance of the Taiwan issue in Chinese politics, the man lauded by People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) commentators as the apex product of the Chinese political system\u2019s meritocracy, whose \u201cXi Jinping Thought\u201d is so rewarding and profound as to deserve mention in the Chinese constitution and frequent study by Chinese citizens, has merely continued the manifestly unsuccessful approach of his predecessors: use a big stick and a rotten carrot.\n\nBeijing has increased its pressure on Taiwan to agree to a settlement of the cross-Strait issue acceptable to Beijing. China has severed the links between semi-official cross-Strait liaison offices. After a brief \u201cdiplomatic truce,\u201d Beijing is again working to lure away states that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, including the Solomon Islands and Kiribati in quick succession. At least two Taiwan nationals are evidently in detention in China for political crimes. China has reduced the flow of commerce benefitting Taiwan and stepped up military air and sea patrols intended to intimidate the island.\n\nBeijing has done all of this to force the Taiwanese to want to be part of China. At the same time, however, Beijing has made the already unpopular prospect of political unification with the PRC even less attractive, most notably through the dramatic increase in political repression inside China since Xi became the paramount leader in 2012.\n\nXi\u2019s excesses in his country\u2019s relations with the United States have also moved Washington to remove some of the self-imposed restrictions on U.S. engagement with Taiwan, resulting in a stronger U.S.-Taiwan relationship\u2014the opposite of Beijing\u2019s desired outcome.\n\nThe main issue in cross-Strait relations for several decades has been managing the gradual \u201closs\u201d of Taiwan by a Chinese Communist Party government that has unwisely defined the political reintegration of Taiwan as a test of the party\u2019s legitimacy to rule China. The problem is avoiding a decision by Beijing to use military force to prevent Taiwan from permanently closing off the possibility of unification. Yet Taiwanese nationalism, distinct from Chinese nationalism, is growing in Taiwan. Reflective of a long trend, nearly 60 percent of people in Taiwan now identify themselves as \u201cTaiwanese,\u201d while less than 4 percent see themselves as \u201cChinese.\u201d\n\nTaiwan long ago became de-facto independent and clearly satisfies the criteria for statehood: territory, population, and a government that effectively administers them. While much smaller entities enjoy unquestioned status as independent states, Taiwan is more populous than two-thirds of the world\u2019s countries and is among the world\u2019s top twenty-five economies. While the Republic of China state that now controls Taiwan previously ruled over mainland China, the CCP government has never ruled over Taiwan.\n\nBased solely on reason and the modern political norm of self-determination, the people residing in Taiwan should decide whether or not their island is politically part of China and which government should rule it.\n\nUnfortunately, because China is a large and consequential country, the CCP has been able to force the international community to accommodate the party\u2019s own domestic legitimacy issue. Having cultivated Chinese nationalism as a strategy of regime survival, Beijing has used that nationalism to practice extortion: the world must accept the \u201cone China\u201d principle, or else the hurt feelings of the mainland Chinese will create irresistible pressure on the Chinese government to go to war.\n\nThe \u201c\u201992 Consensus\u201d\u2014shorthand for the idea that both Taipei and Beijing accept that there is one \u201cChina\u201d even if they disagree over whether it is the PRC or the ROC that rightfully rules it\u2014was a useful way of lowering cross-Strait tensions during the ROC presidency of Ma Ying-jeou from 2008 to 2016. Ma represented the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party, KMT), which fundamentally sees Taiwan as part of China. This predictably changed when the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which sees Taiwan as not part of China, gained the presidency and a majority in the ROC legislature in 2016. New president Tsai Ying-wen refused to endorse the 1992 Consensus. Beijing retaliated by imposing the multifaceted policy of coercion against Taiwan that continues today.", "description": "The Xi Jinping era has been disastrous for Chinese society, for China\u2019s foreign relations with much of the world, and particularly for cross-Strait relations.", "authors": ["Denny Roy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NUCbDWZwo743Ik4wrjPCTw--~B/aD05OTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/7958b58ff9a7203336d67e702ecbe1fa", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
