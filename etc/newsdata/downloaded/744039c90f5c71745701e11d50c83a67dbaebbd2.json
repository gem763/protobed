About 80% of patients were under age 35.\n\nThe CDC issued updated guidance for doctors, urging them to be especially watchful of patients who may have both a vaping lung injury and an unrelated respiratory infection.\n\nThe CDC had previously advised doctors to rule out infections before considering vaping injuries, but that was during the summer months, when there are fewer cases of respiratory infections such as flu.\n\n\"It may be more complicated to understand now that we expect to see a higher degree of respiratory infections,\" Schuchat said. The CDC is now advising doctors to devise treatments that would address both conditions.\n\nSchuchat said a handful of vaping patients who recovered and were discharged were later readmitted to the hospital, but it was not clear whether these individuals resumed vaping and incurred a new injury.\n\nThe new guidelines urge doctors to follow up with patients a week after discharge, and to begin vaping cessation treatments or therapies for THC and nicotine before patients leave the hospital.\n\nDr. Ned Sharpless, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said the agency has begun testing on more than 700 product samples and product parts gathered from patients and health officials.\n\nFDA scientists are testing for a broad range of chemicals, including nicotine, THC and other marijuana components, metals, cutting agents and other additives, pesticides and toxins.\n\n\"Based on our testing of samples to date, there does not appear to be one product or substance involved in all of the cases. It may be there is more than one cause to this outbreak,\" he said on the call.\n\n\"We do know that THC is present in most of the samples tested to date,\" Sharpless said.\n\nMitch Zeller, director of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said the agency has evaluated 225 THC-containing products and found Vitamin E acetate - a cutting agent - in nearly half of them.\n\nSharpless said the FDA is collaborating with customs and border control agents to intercept any products containing illicit substances.\n\n\"If we determine that someone is manufacturing or distributing illicit, adulterated vaping products that cause illness or death for personal profit, we would consider that to be a criminal act,\" he said.\n\nThe CDC and the FDA continue to urge people to stop vaping, especially products containing THC.
