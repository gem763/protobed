Photo: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt might be the dumbest controversy of the entire Trump administration \u2014 or at least of the last week. On Wednesday, in an attempt to cover up inaccurate statements he\u2019d previously made about Hurricane Dorian threatening Alabama, President Trump showed White House reporters a map altered to suggest the storm had once been expected to drive deep into the Heart of Dixie. But the alteration \u2014 a big black bubble on the end of a big white bubble \u2014 was obvious. And soon, Trump Sharpie memes were born.\n\nBloomberg reported that Trump drew on the National Hurricane Center map himself, which makes perfect sense. This issue, which Trump continued braying about on Twitter Thursday, is a microcosm of the man. It illustrates his inability to admit he\u2019s wrong, his willingness to bend facts to meet his fiction, and the nonchalance with which he lies. And it had people imagining all the other things he might like to alter with a Sharpie.\n\nHere are some of the best Trump Sharpie memes:\n\nOMG!
