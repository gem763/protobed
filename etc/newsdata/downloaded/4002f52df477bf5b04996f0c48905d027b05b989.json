Last week, Pompeo said he had not fully read the whistleblower complaint that centers in on the call.\n\nThe pivotal whistleblower complaint was declassified and released last week. It involves a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden is discussed, with Trump asking for a \"favor.\" Prior to its release, reports trickled out about the complaint and even prompted an announced formal impeachment inquiry from the House, and the White House releasing a summary transcript.\n\nClinton said that calls to foreign leaders are usually \"highly prepared,\" as several departments meet and compile talking points for the president to refer to while on the call. However, Clinton said she believes that was not the case with the Ukraine call because \"you've got a president who doesn't listen to anybody and doesn't follow instructions whatsoever.\"\n\nShe also addressed reports that the transcript of the call was stored on a \"highly classified system that is used for the most important secrets,\" like the Osama bin Laden raid in 2011.\n\n\u2014The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) October 1, 2019\n\nRead more: Mike Pompeo reportedly took part in Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president\n\n\"Even though there was nothing classified in it, the president's behavior was at least embarrassing, if not illegal and impeachable,\" Clinton told Colbert. \"So, I think if the secretary of state was on the call, as is now being reported, he should've been one of the very first people to just say, 'Wait a minute, we got to clean this up. You can't let that stand.'\"\n\n\"But, we don't know what he did,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked about Trump sending his private attorney Rudy Giuliani out on foreign meetings, Clinton said that it is not unusual for presidents and even secretaries of state to employ an envoy or special adviser to deliver a message.\n\n\"But again, it is supposed to be carefully thought through, and from what we've seen on television, 'carefully thinking through' is not one of Rudy's strong points,\" Clinton said of the former New York mayor.", "description": "Hillary Clinton responded to reports that current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the call at the center of the whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d92d3942e22af34bf5339d2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
