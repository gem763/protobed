I looked at it today before I got in the car. I know he will be proud, and so will his family. This team should be proud, too.\u201d\n\nHamilton\u2019s boss Toto Wolff said: \u201cWe want to dedicate this to Niki because he\u2019s been such an important part from the beginning of the journey and his sheer presence was always so important. He was a very special person.\u201d\n\nHamilton will win his sixth championship a week on Sunday in Mexico City if he takes the chequered flag and team-mate Bottas finishes fifth or lower.\n\nBut the Mercedes cars have struggled at the high-altitude venue in recent seasons, and Hamilton fears he will have to wait for a title, which will move him to within one of Michael Schumacher\u2019s record.\n\nThe US Grand Prix follows the round in Mexico before the season\u2019s final races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi.\n\nHamilton, 34, added: \u201cFor me it has never been a case of wanting to rush things.\n\n\u201cValtteri has driven well all year long, and done well today, and he will most likely do a very solid job over the next few races. So we still have a battle and the fight continues.\n\n\u201cMexico is our Achilles heel, our worst race of the year, so it is going to be a tough one for us. The last few have been pretty shocking.\n\n\u201cIt going to be very hard to beat Ferrari there. I don\u2019t anticipate it will be Mexico where I win it the title.\u201d", "description": "Lewis Hamilton dedicated Mercedes\u2019 historic constructors\u2019 championship to the team\u2019s late non-executive chairman Niki Lauda.
