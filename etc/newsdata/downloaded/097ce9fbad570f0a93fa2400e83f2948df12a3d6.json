Levin had accompanied Harry on his many engagements and shadowed him for more than a year.\n\nSUZANNE GOSSELIN: WHY MEGHAN MARKLE'S EMOTIONAL 'NOT OK' INTERVIEW SPEAKS SO POWERFULLY TO NEW MOMS\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE\u2019S \u2018PAIN\u2019 AND \u2018THE ATTACKS SHE FACES\u2019 HAVE MADE PRINCE HARRY DETERMINED \u2018TO SORT IT OUT\u2019: REPORT\n\nMost recently, Levin released a paperback version of her book, which takes a closer look at Harry\u2019s marriage to the 38-year-old. For her newest release, Levin had access to numerous sources who had insider knowledge of the couple.\n\nLevin says Harry's distress stems from retracing his beloved mother\u2019s steps in Angola earlier this month. Princess Diana of Wales died in 1997 at age 36 from injuries she sustained in a car crash in Paris.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Diana was ruthlessly hounded by the paparazzi.\n\n\u201cIt seems unfortunate now,\u201d Levin explained. \u201cHe is having another wave of agony over his mother, Princess Diana. The trip was going to be very difficult as he was retracing his mother\u2019s steps.\u201d\n\nWENDY WILLIAMS SLAMS MEGHAN MARKLE: 'NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR YOU'\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE WANTS PEOPLE TO SEE HER, PRINCE HARRY 'AS A COUPLE WHO'S IN LOVE'\n\nLevin also suggested there is more to the couple\u2019s \u201cunhappiness,\u201d as it was witnessed in their documentary.\n\nThe pair participated in the ITV documentary \u201cHarry & Meghan: An African Journey,\u201d which debuted in the UK on Sunday. They both spoke out about how the negative press attention has hurt them as a family.\n\nIn the documentary, Harry told British journalist Tom Bradby that Diana was on his mind while embarking on his royal tour of southern Africa alongside the Duchess of Sussex and their son Archie.\n\n\u201cLook, part of this job and part of any job, like anybody, means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut again, for me and for my wife, of course, there\u2019s a lot of stuff that hurts \u2014 especially when the majority of it is untrue.\u201d\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM IS \u2018WORRIED\u2019 ABOUT PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE AFTER EMOTIONAL DOCUMENTARY: REPORT\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE ADMITS SHE \u2018NEVER THOUGHT\u2019 ROYAL LIFE \u2018WOULD BE EASY, BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FAIR\u2019\n\n\u201cBut all we need to do is focus on being real, focus on being the people we are and standing up for what we believe in,\u201d continued Harry. \u201cI will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mom.\u201d\n\nMarkle also told Bradby she hopes the public will one day just focus on the positive: the love the couple has for each other.\n\n\u201cI would hope that people, the world, will get to the point where they just see us as a couple who\u2019s in love because I don\u2019t wake up every day and identify as being anything other than who I\u2019ve always been,\u201d said the former \u201cSuits\u201d star.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019m Meghan and I\u2019ve married this incredible man and this to me is just part of our love story,\u201d she noted.\n\nPRINCE HARRY APPEARS TO HINT AT RIFT BETWEEN HIM AND PRINCE WILLIAM\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY TO TAKE SABBATICAL WITH BABY ARCHIE, WANT TO MOVE OUT OF UK: REPORT\n\nIn the documentary, Bradby asked the Duchess of Sussex how she\u2019s coping with the lack of privacy and ruthless tabloid rumors as a new parent, to which the former American actress replied she takes \u201ceach day as it comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the grass is always greener,\u201d said Markle. \u201cYou have no idea. It\u2019s really hard to understand what it\u2019s like. I know what it seems like it should be, but it\u2019s a very different thing.\u201d\n\nMarkle said she and Harry have had conversations about being in the spotlight and all the negativity that comes with it.\n\n\u201cI have said for a long time to H, that\u2019s what I call him, \u2018It\u2019s not enough to just survive something,\u2019\u201d said Markle. \"'That\u2019s not the point of life. You have to thrive. You have got to feel happy.\u2019 I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a \u2018stiff upper life.\u2019 I really tried, but I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.\u201d\n\nPRINCE HARRY SAYS MOM PRINCESS DIANA'S DEATH IS A 'WOUND THAT FESTERS'\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE REVEALS STRUGGLES OF BEING A MOM IN THE PUBLIC EYE: \u2018NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED IF I\u2019M OK\u2019\n\nThe royal went on to tell Bradby she would be more understanding about the scrutiny if it were fair.\n\n\u201cI never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair,\u201d said Markle. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really hard to reconcile.\u201d\n\nIn August of this year, Levin told Fox News that Markle\u2019s journey of being the newest member of the British royal family has been far from smooth sailing.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very hard for her,\u201d said Levin at the time. \u201cI think she\u2019s done brilliantly at some things. She\u2019s marvelous when they are out and about. She\u2019s very good at talking to people. It\u2019s an awful lot to learn and she\u2019s very energetic and keen. But it might be good for her if she took a little bit more advice. Before in her life, she was very used to making her own decisions. I do think it\u2019s very difficult for her. This is a very strict, traditional path. It takes a while to get used to it.\u201d\n\nPRINCE HARRY BREAKS DOWN TALKING ABOUT ANXIETIES OF PARENTHOOD, MEGHAN MARKLE'S PREGNANCY\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY SHARE SWEET MOMENT WITH SON ARCHIE IN UPCOMING DOCUMENTARY\n\n\u201cIn the early stages, I don\u2019t think the duchess really understood the difference between being a show business person and being a member of the royal family,\u201d Levin explained. \u201cPrince Harry was very anxious when we spoke originally and said he didn\u2019t want to be thought of like a show business person. His feeling about being royal was that it was about duty, it was about helping the queen and that it was a very serious job. But the line has been a very narrow one, I think.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Mariah Haas contributed to this report.", "description": "British journalist Angela Levin believes Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are still coping after their recent tour of southern Africa where they candidly spoke out about the pressures of royal life in a shocking documentary.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/03/06/694940094001_6010866432001_6010864336001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
