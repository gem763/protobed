As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. \u2013 Fans who don't wear green and gold will stand out at the Packers' game in Los Angeles this week.\n\nSecondary market ticket broker VividSeats predicted that 70 percent of Dignity Health Sports Park's 30,000 seats will be filled by Packers fans for the 4:25 p.m., ET game ths Sunday2494855001 Nov. 3 game.\n\nThe Packers are 7-1 after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs 31-24 on Sunday. The Los Angeles Chargers, who are 3-5, eked out a 17-16 victory over Chicago on Sunday when the Bears' kicker missed a last-second field goal.\n\nOn Monday, ticket prices for the game were higher for at least the fourth consecutive week, coming in at $372 for the average cost of ticket brokers' lowest-priced tickets. That's up from $344 last week and from $312 on Oct. 7.\n\nThe price notwithstanding, Green Bay effectively will have its ninth home game of the season Sunday, only in better weather. Pittsburgh fans created a similar situation when the Steelers played in Los Angeles earlier this year.\n\nVividSeats' Fan Forecast utilizes various data, including proprietary sales information, to project the makeup of the crowd.\n\nOct 18, 2015; Green Bay, WI, USA; San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers (17) throws a pass in the first quarter during the game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.

Because the Packers are an unexpected 7-1, prices were higher for all but two games \u2014 against the woeful 1-7 Washington Redskins and the forever can't-get-no-respect Detroit Lions. Those games remained below-face-value bargains.\n\nMoving higher since last week were the average lowest prices for the Carolina Panthers game at Lambeau Field on Nov. 10, up $17 to $154, and the San Francisco 49ers game at Levi's Stadium on Nov. 24, up $22 to $206.\n\nAlso higher since last checked on Aug. 26, were prices for the New York Giants, Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings games.\n\nThe NFL announced Monday that the Packers-Panthers game was moved from noon to a 3:25 p.m. start time, another consequence of the Packers being more successful than expected.\n\nCuriously, the average lowest price for the Washington Redskins game on Dec. 8 at Lambeau Field remained the same as in August at $100. The Detroit Lions game, at Ford Field on Dec. 29, came in at $65, down from $72 in August. This is the fourth consecutive year that the Packers will finish their season against Detroit, and none of them have sold well.", "description": "The Chargers already saw Steelers fans have a heavy presence in Los Angeles, and the Packers could produce a similar look.", "authors": ["Richard Ryman", "Published A.M.
