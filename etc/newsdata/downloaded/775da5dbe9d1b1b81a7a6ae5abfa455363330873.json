Officials\u2019 family members may also be subject to these restrictions, he added.\n\nPompeo did not specify which officials would be affected by the measure.

The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these abuses.\u201d\n\nChina, which is scheduled to engage in high-level trade talks with the U.S. later this week, has criticized the Trump administration for interfering in its domestic affairs.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement that the visa restrictions violate \u201cthe basic norms governing international relations, interferes in China\u2019s internal affairs and undermines China\u2019s interests.\n\n...relations, interferes in China's internal affairs and undermines China's interests. China deplores and firmly opposes that. Xinjiang does not have the so-called human rights issue claimed by the US.
