Diplomatic ties were severed at the time and have not been restored since.\n\nSaakashvili, whose image was used during the attack, served as Georgia's president during the war, but now resides outside the country and faces criminal charges at home.\n\nMost of the websites affected by the attack should be back online by the end of Tuesday, ProService, a Georgian web design and host providing company, said.\n\nPolice are working together with law enforcement agencies in other partner countries, the interior ministry said in the same statement.
