Whether you view the pea guac as an affront, or merely an attempt to mix up a very popular dish, it at least raised the question of what makes a good guacamole.\n\nAnswer: not a lot, actually, in terms of ingredients or effort. To help perfect this staple synonymous with Mexican food, we turned to an expert on the cuisine, chef and cookbook author Pati Jinich (the new season of her public television series, \u201cPati\u2019s Mexican Table,\u201d debuts nationwide Friday). \u201cI feel very strongly about guacamole,\u201d she says. Well, in that case \u2026\n\nThe avocados. Ripe ripe ripe ripe ripe. Jinich says the biggest mistake home cooks make is using avocados that aren\u2019t ready for prime time. Look for fruit that gives slightly to pressure and fills its skin. Cook\u2019s Illustrated suggests flicking the stem. If it comes off easily and shows green flesh underneath, the avocado is ready to use. For more advice on avocado shopping and prepping, check out my primer from last year.\n\n[How to slice, pit and peel an avocado without ending up in the ER]\n\nCook\u2019s Country recommends using Hass avocados over the Florida avocados you might also see in the store. Hass are creamier thanks to their higher amount of fat and smoother texture, with an earthier, more robust flavor than the sweeter, more pulpy Florida avocados.\n\n\n\n(Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nMixing and mashing. Resist the temptation to puree your guacamole to oblivion, which is often what you\u2019ll find at the grocery store. You don\u2019t necessarily have to go the complete opposite direction, either, by investing in a restaurant-style molcajete. Jinich says you need nothing more than a bowl and dinner fork to assemble guacamole. Cook\u2019s Illustrated had a more novel approach in its most recent guacamole recipe, which involved using a whisk to create a creamy but still somewhat chunky texture.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for interpretation on how far you want to take mashing. For dipping and situations where guacamole plays a starring role, leave larger pieces of avocado. Try something smoother if you\u2019re incorporating it into tacos or burritos. You can go for a hybrid approach by mashing some of the avocado and dicing the rest.\n\nSeasoning. \u201cI love guacamoles that highlight the taste of the avocado,\u201d Jinich says. So don\u2019t go overboard. Lime juice, a standard ingredient, itself is controversial. Not everyone believes in adding it to guacamole, including cookbook author and Mexican food authority Diana Kennedy, whose recipe Food editor Joe Yonan championed in a guacamole Super Bowl smackdown more than a decade ago. Jinich can\u2019t abide \u201ccrazy additions of cumin \u2026 I think it just kills the freshness of the avocado.\u201d\n\n[Diana Kennedy, fiery chronicler of Mexican food traditions]\n\nEqually important: Don\u2019t underseason. Because avocados are so buttery and smooth, you\u2019d do well to make sure there\u2019s some contrast and brightness. Jinich likes to keep it pretty low-key. In addition to lime juice (1 tablespoon per avocado or two), she adds onion, sea or kosher salt, cilantro, and a jalape\u00f1o or serrano pepper. Taste as you work \u2014 you can always add more seasoning. To ensure the seasoning is broken down for even, easy distribution, you can try the Cook\u2019s Illustrated strategy of mincing the onion and pepper with kosher salt to form a paste.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not using additional ingredients, there are still ways to impart additional flavor. Jinich makes a smoky guacamole by charring the hot pepper, onion and garlic in a skillet or under the broiler until they\u2019re blackened. Our former Smoke Signals columnist, Jim Shahin, took it a step further by briefly grilling the avocados.\n\nThe rest. \u201cA lot of people like to add tomatoes to their traditional guacamole,\u201d Jinich says, which she\u2019s okay with up to a certain extent. That means checking the quality of the tomatoes. If they\u2019re watery, they will just ruin the texture and flavor of the guacamole. Consider seeding the tomato, too.\n\nTry topping your guacamole with fun and interesting ingredients, rather incorporating them into the guacamole itself. Jinich\u2019s partial list of possibilities includes crab meat, chorizo, queso fresco and pomegranate seeds. This is generally where Jinich adds roasted cherry tomatoes, rather than raw, diced tomatoes.\n\nServing. The most popular accompaniment is tortilla chips. But I won\u2019t discourage you if you prefer to eat your guacamole with pita chips or crudit\u00e9s. Don\u2019t stop there, though. Try it scooped into hard-boiled eggs or atop grilled fish. Even inside a sandwich is great.\n\nGuacamole is obviously a party favorite, the kind of thing that can hang out while guests mix and mingle. In \u201cKeys to Good Cooking,\u201d Harold McGee sets a four-hour maximum for how long it and other similar dips can sit at room temperature. If you anticipate needing it longer than that, leave half the batch in the refrigerator, and replace or replenish as needed.\n\nShould you have any leftovers \u2014 unlikely, but possible \u2014 cover the surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate. It will hold up for about a day in the fridge, and even if you get some discoloration on top, all you need to do is mix it back up until the browning disappears. As to the guacamole disappearing? That will take care of itself soon enough.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nCool, spiced Mexican horchata is the ultimate refresher for fall\n\nTake a more layered approach by adding phyllo dough to your kitchen staples\n\nGrab a spoon.
