In an incredibly candid moment, the 57-year-old singer admitted to having cosmetic surgery because she wanted a \"little sleeker jawline\" before her Las Vegas residency began.\n\nOn Aug. 13, 2019, Abdul launched her headlining show in Las Vegas, \"Paula Abdul: Forever Your Girl,\u201d but before celebrating her 30-year-long career at Flamingo Las Vegas, Abdul revealed she received a number of cosmetic procedures.\n\n\"Women of our age, we start really looking for aesthetic treatments that resonate with you,\" the \"Straight Up\" singer told Williams, who is two years her junior. \"I was thinking, \u2018I'm going to have my residency, I want to do something,\u2019 but I wasn't ready to have the big incisions or any facelift.\"\n\nAbdul turned to InMode, a company that develops, manufactures, and markets platforms that use radio frequency-based technology to perform minimally-invasive procedures.\n\nIn August, following her procedures, Abdul became a brand ambassador for the company.\n\n\"I can do bicep and tricep workouts as much as anyone else, but as you get older, there is only a certain amount of tone and shape that you can have,\" Abdul said in a statement released by the company. \"While maintaining a healthy lifestyle of fitness and skincare routines, I still wanted more definition and tighter, firmer skin at my jawline and arms.\"\n\nAbdul told Williams that while researching, she discovered the company's \"FaceTite\" and \"BodyTite\" technology.\n\n\"I was out, walking around two, three days later,\" she told Williams, adding that the entire process took about \"an hour, maybe even less.\"\n\nShe described the procedures, which she received on her arms, lower face, jawline and neck, as \"minimally invasive\" with no visible scars and little downtime.\n\nAbdul's \"Forever Your Girl\" show at the Flamingo is set to continue into December.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
