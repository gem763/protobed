If you're not able to tune it out then it can be a weight on your shoulders.'\n\nDespite disappointing in the defeat by Canada, he will hope to play a role this weekend Newcastle visit Stamford Bridge.", "description": "The 21-year-old was withdrawn on the hour mark with the United States drawing 0-0 with rivals Canada and was unable to hold back the tears on the bench after he came off.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/09/19778800-0-image-a-27_1571215652713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
