REUTERS/Gary Cameron\n\nWhile the U.S. currency has been in favour for several years thanks to its relatively high interest rate and a strong economy, the ongoing trade war with China and a scramble for funding in U.S. money markets has added fuel to the fire.\n\nThe list of reasons for the dollar\u2019s strength won\u2019t make for easy reading for U.S. President Donald Trump, who has frequently accused other countries of manipulating their currencies and called for a weaker dollar.\n\nBelow are a series of charts explaining just why the U.S. currency .DXY EUR=EBS is so strong.\n\nHOW WELL IS THE DOLLAR DOING?\n\nThe dollar\u2019s outperformance is particularly broad, with an index compiled by Commerzbank showing that measured against a swathe of rival currencies it has risen more than 3.5% since July 1.\n\nThe euro has not declined as much, given it has held up well against a weakening yuan - China is one of the euro zone\u2019s biggest trading partners - but the sheer size of the dollar\u2019s rally has left the single currency down 0.5% over a similar period.\n\nFor a graphic on USD EUR indexes, click here\n\nThe dollar has gained almost regardless of what has happened with U.S.-China trade negotiations, which have emerged as a principal determinant of market sentiment under Trump.\n\nWhen talks with Beijing have broken down, investors have piled into the dollar looking for a safe haven thanks to its deep liquid markets.\n\nYet when a truce in the trade war has seemed within reach, traders have also bought the greenback, anticipating an economic boost from any trade deal.\n\nSENTIMENTS DIVERGE\n\nThe relative outperformance of the U.S. economy has been a significant driver for dollar strength in the last two years, but it is signs of a deepening downturn in the euro zone that have played a major role recently.\n\nAccording to Citigroup, the gap between the euro zone and the United States on an economic surprise index has risen sharply. Europe is now underperforming by a bigger margin than at any time since late 2017.\n\nThat corresponds with a move lower in the euro from around $1.20 to below $1.09. The euro hit a low of $1.03 in January 2017.\n\nEuro zone manufacturing surveys last week were the most recent to miss expectations - although so have some in the United States - and a Reuters story on Monday on German economic institutes preparing to slash German economic growth forecasts again sent the euro hurtling lower.\n\nFor a graphic on CESI and EURUSD, click here\n\nMONEY MARKET PRESSURES\n\nRuctions last month in the U.S. \u201crepo\u201d market - a market for short-term funding - may also explain why dollars are so in demand.\n\nInterest rates in the $2.2 trillion market for repurchase agreements rose as high as 10% on Sept. 17 as demand for overnight cash from companies, banks and other borrowers exceeded supply.\n\nFor a graphic on U.S. overnight repo and libor-OIS spread, click here\n\nBanks and investors called it the most serious disturbance in the U.S. money markets since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\n\nWhile the jury is out on the significance of the spike in repo rates, concerns about a shortage of short dated dollar-denominated funding have increased.\n\nDemand for offshore dollars has also grown sharply, according to cross-currency basis swaps, an agreement in which one counterparty borrows one currency from another institution and lends the same value in a different currency.\n\nFor a graphic on Money market pressures and DXY, click here\n\nRATE EXPECTATIONS\n\nAnd then there is the relatively high yield investors earn on U.S. government bonds versus those in the euro zone.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve has launched a rate-cutting cycle this year, so has the European Central Bank, and expectations are that U.S. rates will remain far higher than other developed markets for the foreseeable future.\n\nMoney markets on balance expect a 25 basis point rate cut to the current Fed rate of 2% in October, but that would still leave rates far above the -0.6% of the euro zone.\n\nOvernight index swaps in the United States all yield more than 1.5% out to a 1-year maturity.\n\nFor a graphic on Money market expectations, click here", "description": "The dollar surged to a 29-month high against a basket of rival currencies on Tuesday, while pummelling the euro to its weakest since May 2017.", "authors": ["Saikat Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435945752&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF90342", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
