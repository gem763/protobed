Pictured, the clinic\n\nAccording to a BBC investigation in July, a bag of heroin can be bought for as little as \u00a35 in Middlesborough - cheaper than a pack of cigarettes.\n\nEarlier this year Mr Coppinger faced calls to resign after the force was rated inadequate in a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies, Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS).\n\nUnder the programme, participants will visit a clinic twice a day, where diamorphine, medical grade heroin, will be administered under supervision.\n\nAs they are freed from the need to constantly fund drug deals, the addicts can use their time to engage with agencies to improve their lives and return to mainstream society.\n\nInternal reports from Mr Coppinger\u2019s office reveal that the 15 people chosen to benefit from the pilot scheme are addicts with criminal records.\n\nEarly research found that 20 of the most hardcore addicts in the North East town \u2013 some of whom will now get free heroin in the project \u2013 had committed a total of 351 offences such as shoplifting in two years, \u2018costing society \u00a3784,890\u2019.\n\nMr Coppinger has said the trial will focus on long-term drug users \u2018for whom all other treatment has failed and who are known to be the most active criminals in the town as they look to finance their addiction\u2019.\n\nHe estimates the annual cost to the taxpayer \u2013 \u00a312,000 per addict \u2013 represents a saving to society. While removing the need for addicts to steal to buy drugs, it is hoped the project will \u2018finally get users off drugs, off the streets and back into society\u2019 while also freeing up NHS and police resources.\n\nThe PCC has provided \u00a3131,287 towards the scheme, with the rest coming from prisons, probation and public health budgets.\n\nThe project has already been agreed by the Home Office.\n\nThe Middlesbrough trial is expected to be followed by another in Darlington, run by neighbouring Durham Police.\n\nThe scheme, the first of its kind in England, was created by under-fire Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Coppinger\n\nMr Coppinger said: 'The policies of the past have failed. If we are serious about tackling and preventing addiction we need to listen to the experts, take notice of the evidence and act decisively.\n\n'Police need to continue to relentlessly target the organised gangs and dealers behind the supply of street heroin and, at the same time, we need to provide effective treatment to release users from their snares and take early preventive action to prevent others becoming addicted.\n\n'There are numerous studies that show HAT is cost-effective.\n\n'In Middlesbrough the most prolific cohort of 20 drug-dependent offenders have cost the public purse almost \u00a3800,000 over two years - and that's based only on crime detected.\n\n'By removing street heroin from the equation, you remove the need to commit crime to fund addiction and the impact this has on local residents and businesses.\n\n'You remove the health risks of street heroin and the associated drugs litter, and you remove the drain on public services, including health and police.\n\n'In addition, you halt the flow of funding to drugs gangs.'\n\nFifteen of the most prolific offenders in Middlesbrough will be able to inject the Class A drug three times a day at a special NHS clinic from this month (file image)\n\nClinical lead Daniel Ahmed said: 'This treatment and recovery pilot is aimed at those for whom all other current methods have failed.\n\n'They are on a cycle of offending, committing crime to raise funds for street heroin, being arrested and going to prison, being released and offending again.\n\n'The cycle often only ends when they die, often in the street.\n\n'Before joining the pilot, each of the cohort is medically assessed and the appropriate course of diamorphine is prescribed and administered under supervision daily at a specialist clinic. This removes the constant need to commit crime in order to fund street heroin addiction.'", "description": "The plan using medical grade heroin is the first of its kind in the country and is designed to cut crime and reduce the number of addicts dying.
