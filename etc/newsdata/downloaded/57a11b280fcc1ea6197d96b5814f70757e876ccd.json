He recently performed with Earl Sweatshirt in New York, and he was a lookbook model for Supreme. (His sister, Paloma, is also a model. Genetics, man.) His rapper moniker is Navy Blue. But Elsesser lights up the most when he talks about skating, which he\u2019s done since he was 4 years old. \u201cIt teaches you discipline and empathy from a young age. Falling, hurting yourself, pushing through the pain \u2014 it\u2019s all life lessons.\u201d We talked with him about Jamaica, Alicia Keys, and Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nWhat is your most used emoji? I use the face palm the most, but my favorite is the Muslim prayer hands. The \u201cgive thanks\u201d hands.\n\nIf you could spend three months anywhere, where would it be? Jamaica. Just chill and be with some Rastas and learn how to live off the land.\n\nIf you had a superpower, what would it be? Teleportation.\n\nWhat is the best album ever made? I can\u2019t answer that, that\u2019s impossible. But my favorite album is Pieces of a Man.\n\nWhat\u2019s your go-to karaoke song? I don\u2019t really do karaoke, but any of the top five Alicia Keys songs.\n\nWhat fictional character would you want to hang out with? Ang from Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nIf you were a magazine, which magazine would you be? Whichever one is Black.\n\nJeans or sweats? Sweats.\n\nIf you could talk to animals which animals would you want to talk to? Some kind of big bird, like a hawk or an eagle. Or a whale, I\u2019d talk to like the oldest whale.\n\nWhat do you eat for breakfast? A smoothie and avocado toast, or oatmeal.\n\nIf you could only eat three things for the rest of your life, what would they be? Rice, beans, and mango.\n\nIf you were a color what color would you be? My favorite color is navy blue, but I feel like I would be some earth color, like a terra-cotta.\n\nPhoto: Shaniqwa Jarvis\n\nProduction Credits Photographs by Shaniqwa Jarvis\n\nPhotography Direction by Liane Radel\n\nStyling by Diana Tsui\n\nHair by Yasutak\u00e9 at the Brooks Agency NYC\n\nMakeup by Marcelo Gutierrez at She Likes Cutie using M.A.C.
