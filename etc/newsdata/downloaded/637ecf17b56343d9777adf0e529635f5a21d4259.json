They pose a threat to our security. They are undesirable in Denmark.\n\n\"The government will therefore do everything possible to prevent them from returning to Denmark.\"\n\nAuthorities believe at least 158 people from Denmark have joined militant Islamist groups in Syria or Iraq since 2012, about 27 of whom remain in the conflict zone. Twelve of these are believed to be imprisoned.\n\nAll 27 are Danish nationals but it is unclear how many of those have dual citizenship.\n\nEuropeans comprise a fifth of around 10,000 Islamic State fighters held captive in Syria by Kurdish militias which are now under heavy attack by Turkish forces. If the militias redeploy prison guards to the front line, there is a risk of jail-breaks.\n\nThe proposed new law, which has broad support among lawmakers of different parties, would allow the government to strip fighters abroad who also hold another nationality of their Danish citizenship without a court order.\n\nThe law would not apply to single nationality Danes who could be left stateless.\n\nOther European countries have also said they will strip dual nationals who joined Islamic State of citizenship.\n\nThey are reluctant to try such foreign fighters at home, fearing a public backlash, difficulties in collating evidence against them, and the risk of renewed attacks by militants on European soil.", "description": "Denmark says it plans to accelerate the processing of legislation that would allow the government to strip citizenship from dual nationals who have left to fight for militant groups abroard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/16/80/1000x563_cmsv2_46e5f46b-eacb-5690-b066-6fefe394fe25-4231680.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
