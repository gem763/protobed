The suspects waited for the victims to arrive at the resort,\u201d said Galvez.\n\nMore gunmen arrived and entered the beach resort on Friday, taking the couple to the beach front, and forcing them in to two motorised boats. The vessels fled in two directions. It was not clear if the couple were in one boat or were separated.\n\nThe military alerted its forces and was coordinating a search operation with police, according to a local military spokesperson, Captain Clint Antipala.\n\nSecurity forces have not identified the group behind the abduction and no one has claimed responsibility.\n\nThe region is home to numerous armed groups including Abu Sayyaf . The highly factionalised group has leaders who are focused on kidnapping foreigners for ransom while others have recently pledged allegiance to Islamic state. The group has been responsible for suicide bombings in the region.\n\nA trilateral patrol agreement between the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia in the Sulu Sea, surrounding island provinces where Abu Sayyaf Group mainly operate, has reduced kidnappings in recent years.\n\nThe Zamboanga Peninsula in mainland Mindanao, where the latest abduction happened, has not seen incidents of kidnapping in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since an incident of kidnapping happened in our area. We are alarmed,\u201d said Galvez.", "description": "Allan Hyrons, 70, and Filipina wife Wilma were taken by armed men on Friday night in Mindanao region", "authors": ["Carmela Fonbuena"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd0d14810dca457fe5ccd3df898cceeef180ab97/80_170_625_375/master/625.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=710556bb6cb8af6958502e4e37aa7c72", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
