The Colorado-based couple married five years ago and had three kids together, before Ashley realized that their relationship was crumbling.\n\nMatthew and Ashley discussed the idea of trying something new, and since meeting their new partner, mom-of-four Keila Perez, and welcoming their own fourth biological child, things have never been better.\n\nPolyamorous: Colorado-based throuple (L-R) Keila Perez and Matt and Ashley Lawrence live together with their eight kids and Ashley's grandparents in a house that's all about 'more love'\n\nModern family: Ashley, Matt and Keila (pictured center L-R), share parental duties of eight children. Ashley's mom Deborah, in pink shirt, also lives with them\n\nAshley told Barcroft TV, 'Initially it started as me opening the relationship between me and Matt or suggesting trying to figure out what was next for us when we were having hard times.\n\n'I had only ever been with Matt since I was a teenager,' Ashley continued. 'I'd always been curious about women as well for different reasons.\n\n'Also, I was just missing the friendship, wanting to have a really good friend and somebody that we can hang out and do girl stuff with besides just hanging out with my guy.\n\n'I thought maybe it would be a good idea to try something completely different,' she added.\n\nMatt was thrown at first saying, 'I'd never seen a poly relationship in my life, it's always been just a man and a woman.'\n\nRelationship savior: Ashley, right, said that she realized her relationship with Matt was crumbling but since welcoming Keila, left, things have never been better\n\nTwo years ago, Matt met Keila Perez, 32, online and the two of them became good friends.\n\nSoon after they formed a friendly relationship, Matt opened up to Keila about a polyamorous relationship.\n\nKeila admitted that, at first, she was unsure about polyamory.\n\nChildhood sweethearts: Matt and Ashley had been together since meeting in high school as teenagers\n\n'Having feelings for both a man and a woman, for me, in the beginning, was a little bit confusing,' she said.\n\n'It was very scary. And especially when you come from a very strict religious family as I did.'\n\nKeila has four kids from her previous relationship, and said that she was struggling as a single mom trying to juggle working full time and raising her family.\n\nAnd because Matt and Ashley wanted things to be equal between all three of them, they got a divorce a year ago.\n\nIt's certainly a full house, as Ashley's parents also live with the throuple, and the entire family runs a bakery together.\n\nAshley said the situation works though, stating, 'It's more love, more kids, more fun, more happy times, more playing. Lots of help to get each other around.\n\n'Everything is equal,' Keila added. 'There's no first wife, second wife and our kids are all treated equally.'\n\nMatt noted that the trio all sleep in the same bed, and always have done, to avoid causing jealousy.\n\nFull house: Ashley, in blue, Matt, center, and Keila, in white, said that there's no 'first wife or second wife' as 'everything is equal'\n\nJealousy: The throuple avoid jealousy issues by all sleeping in one bed and Matt and Ashley (in black T-shirt) even got divorced to ensure everything is fair\n\nSingle mom: Keila, pictured, said she was struggling while raising her four kids and working full time before meeting the Lawrences\n\n'Sexual pleasures, there's a lot more winning with three people involved. Keila shows me just as much love as she shows Ashley, and Keila shows Ashley just as much love as me so I think it's pretty well rounded,' he said.\n\nHe added, 'We have fights, we have jealousies, obviously a lot more jealousies with us, because there are three of us instead of just two, but even two people have jealousies and problems like that all the time.\n\nNay sayers: Matt, pictured, said that they 'don't care what people think' of their set up\n\n'I feel that now, after two years of being into the relationship, it feels like a normal relationship.'\n\nFor some, polyamory seems extreme and rare despite the lifestyle choice growing in popularity.\n\nMatt said, 'I don't care what people think - we're still going to do it if we want to, that's just how we are.'\n\nAshley agreed, 'The three of us wouldn't work without one of us. It wouldn't be the same, something will always be missing because this is how we've come to love each other.'\n\n'I would definitely say our love is extreme love, not everybody can handle what it takes to have a three-person relationship but I wouldn't say that it's so extreme that nobody else should consider it because it can be a really beautiful thing,' she said.\n\n'I'd say Kayla is basically like a second mum to our kids. She fills them where I lack certain things,' Ashley continued.\n\nI wouldn't say there are drawbacks to the poly relationship so much. I mean, there are obstacles that we go through for sure,' she said.\n\n'But it's a really nice feeling to have that friend that you can talk to, in addition to your partner and your husband.'\n\nFriends: Ashley, left, said having someone like Keila, right, at home to talk to in addition to her husband is 'really nice'\n\nEqual: Ashley, pictured right, said 'everything is equal' among the family of eleven\n\nAt first, their triad was met with criticism, especially from other family members.\n\nAshley admitted her parents were 'really shocked' by her decision to welcome another woman into her marriage.\n\n'Freaked out': Ashley's mom Deborah admitted that at first she was 'shocked' and 'freaked out' by the idea of her daughter's polyamorous relationship but she knows it makes Ashley happy\n\n'I never really disclosed to anyone that I was interested in both women and men' she said.\n\nAshley's mom, Deborah Schmidt, told Barcroft TV, 'It was hard for me to comprehend something like that.\n\nShe joked, 'I'm Ashley's mom, Matt's mother-in-law and Keila's... bonus mom, I guess?'\n\nAt first, Deborah said she 'freaked out' at the concept of the polyamorous relationship.\n\n'I freaked out. I'm old school, I guess. It was hard for me to comprehend something like that. I was surprised that my daughter had an interest in women. She and Matt had been together since they were 15-years-old,' Deborah said.\n\n'I guess I was angry at myself that I didn't realize that after all these years. I mean, that's my daughter.\n\n'It took me a little bit of time and I adjusted, I came to deal with it as it's making her happy. It's what she wants and that's what's important.'\n\n'I still have a little bit of hair that comes up on the back of my neck when I see them be affectionate towards each other,' she admitted. 'But this is the 21st century I guess. It is what it is!'\n\nAnd baby makes eight! Ashley pictured with her youngest son, Julian, who she gave birth to since Keila joined her relationship\n\nFights: Matt, pictured kissing Keila, said that they sometimes still fight but ultimately everything is 'well rounded'\n\n'Two moms': Keila's oldest son Joel, pictured in red T-shirt, said he 'doesn't care' what people say about his new family situation\n\nHowever, Keila insisted that they don't pay attention to any negative criticism.\n\n'We have our kids and we're building something together as a family, we have the same goals.\n\n'We love each other and we care for each other and we want to be there for each and grow old together.\n\n'So that's what we want and that's what we're going to do, whether the world likes it or not.'\n\nKeila's oldest son Joel admitted that it was a lot to get used to at first.\n\n'I have two moms. It was kind of weird at first, but I don't care what people think. Everyone is different in the world,' he said.", "description": "Childhood sweethearts Matt and Ashley Lawrence have been together since they were 15-years-old.
