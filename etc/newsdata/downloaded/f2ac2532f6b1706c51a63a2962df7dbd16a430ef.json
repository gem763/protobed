French far-right leader Marine Le Pen hailed Schinas' title as an \"ideological victory.\"\n\nHow does the Commission get out of this PR disaster? How about putting forward actual policies to prove that Schinas isn't just a migration chief in a populist's hat, but is actually in charge of championing everything that really does make Europe great?\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1. Compulsory siestas\n\nWho cares about productivity when they're asleep? A Continent-wide curfew would ensure that EU citizens get some shut-eye every afternoon, probably after a boozy lunch. The mandatory scheme, which is already in force during August, would be enforced by a new European Boredom Agency.\n\n2. Free lessons on Brexit moaning\n\nAll Europeans love a good gripe about Brexit. But are you making the most of your moaning? Whatever bothers you about the backstop or peeves you about prorogation, this EU-funded training scheme will teach you to take your whining to new levels of annoyingness.\n\n3. Mandatory cheese\n\nScrap identity cards and make all EU citizens carry cheese. As well as being a homage to fromage, it would save police time as a Spaniard could be quickly identified by the smell of her manchego, or a Frenchman by his camembert, especially during summer. Europe needs stop and sniff, not stop and search.\n\n4. Blame Brussels\n\nThis is admittedly a hard one to see the College of Commissioners approving, but is there anything more European than bashing Brussels? A new 24-hour hotline would allow citizens to shout at EU officials about any topic \u2014 if they've been dumped, stubbed their toe or forgotten their umbrella.\n\n5. Making fun of America\n\nWe've got better health care, higher food standards and markedly less gun violence than our transatlantic cousins. So let's remind them of this thanks to an EU-organized cyberbullying campaign.", "description": "If Margaritis Schinas really wants to champion Europe, this is what he should do.", "authors": ["Eddy Wax", "Hans Von Der Burchard", "David M.
