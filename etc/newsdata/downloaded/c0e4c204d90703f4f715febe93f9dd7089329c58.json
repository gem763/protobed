(AP) - Weather-tested residents along the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas were using their experience with past storms to guide them Tuesday as they readied their homes for Hurricane Dorian and decided whether to heed evacuation orders.\n\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d said Ed Bandarovich as he strolled along sunlit Folly Beach outside of Charleston, South Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful beach day, but who knows what tomorrow\u2019s going to bring.\u201d\n\nBandarovich, 70, recently moved to Johns Island, South Carolina, from Woodstock, New York, where he experienced the rare, devastating inland effects of Superstorm Sandy in 2012.\n\nBandarovich said he had been ready for Sandy\u2019s power and its heavy rains but was caught off-guard by the 75 mph (121 kph) wind gusts that swept through the area in the storm\u2019s wake. The winds scattered debris throughout his neighborhood, turned fallen boards and branches into projectiles and knocked out his power for days, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in the preparation, in being aware of what\u2019s going to happen, or could happen,\u201d Bandarovich said, noting that he had boarded up his Johns Island home just in case.\n\nDorian weakened to a Category 2 hurricane Tuesday after slamming into the Bahamas as a terrifying Category 5 storm with 185 mph (298 kph) winds.\n\nPractically parking over the Bahamas for a day and a half, the storm pounded away at the islands Tuesday, devastating thousands of homes. At least five deaths were reported, with the full extent of the damage far from clear.\n\nThe weakened storm pushed northwest at 5 mph (8 kph) with hurricane-force winds extending up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) from its center. While weaker, the storm was continuing to grow in size, according to the National Hurricane Center. The threat of a direct hit on Florida had all but evaporated, but Dorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and South Carolina - and perhaps strike North Carolina - on Thursday or Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster ordered mandatory evacuations along the state\u2019s 190-mile (306-kilometer) coast and turned all lanes of Interstate 26 into a one-way evacuation route heading west. Georgia officials did the same with Interstate 16 after Gov. Brian Kemp ordered coastal evacuations.\n\nAttorney Henry Grimball, 71, said he and his wife would likely ride out Dorian in their narrow four-story home in Charleston\u2019s downtown historic district.\n\n\u201cThese houses have been here since 1770,\u201d Grimball said, gesturing to the white and pastel houses dotting his neighborhood. \u201cThey\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201d\n\nGrimball said he would reconsider, however, if the storm became a Category 3 or stronger hurricane: He remembers the devastation from Hurricane Hugo in 1989.\n\nHugo slammed into South Carolina\u2019s coast with winds gusting as high as 108 mph (174 kph) in Charleston, killing several dozen people, causing nearly $6 billion in damage and toppling a massive magnolia in Grimball\u2019s backyard.\n\n\u201cIt gets to be really dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nForecasters and public officials were concerned that regardless of the storm\u2019s strength, it could dump a dangerous amount of water on the Carolinas.\n\nIn September 2018, slow-moving Hurricane Florence was only a Category 1 storm as it gradually came ashore near the border of the two states. But it dumped nearly 3 feet (1 meter) of rain in some areas, unleashing widespread flooding that left dozens dead and causing $600 million in damage. Thousands of coastal residents were evacuated before the storm.\n\nIn 2016, Hurricane Matthew dumped up to 16 inches (41 centimeters) of rain in North Carolina, flooding and causing about $320 million of damage downstream in South Carolina.\n\nDorian could dump as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain along South Carolina\u2019s northeastern regions, the National Weather Service said.\n\nOn Georgia\u2019s Tybee Island, about 18 miles (28 kilometers) east of Savannah, Joey Spalding said he had decided not to take any risks with Dorian after watching back-to-back storms swamp his island home, in 2016 and then in 2017.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not losing all my stuff this time,\u201d the 50-year-old building contractor said Tuesday as he emptied the contents of his low-lying bungalow into a U-Haul. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t come into the house, I\u2019m not taking a chance.\u201d\n\nIrma sent about 3 feet (1 meter) of seawater from storm surge into Spalding\u2019s house before he had even finished repairing the damage from Hurricane Matthew the year before. Irma ruined most of his furniture and forced him to replace drywall inside the house and siding on the outside.\n\n\u201cDuring Irma, I lost almost everything,\u201d Spalding said.\n\nIn preparation for Dorian, Spalding said he planned to wrap the house in plastic up to shoulder height and pile sandbags in front of the doors.\n\n\u201cIn this case, I don\u2019t have to come into a house full of junk,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m learning a little as I go.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Russ Bynum in Tybee Island, Georgia, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Weather-tested residents along the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas were using their experience with past storms to guide them Tuesday as they readied their homes for Hurricane Dorian and decided whether to heed evacuation orders.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Meg Kinnard"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/tropical_weather_south_carolina_47865_c0-114-2725-1702_s1770x1032.jpg?4d49098dc5b8099eb9dee5eeecbe7135bde7df0c"}
