As soon as plans are in the public domain we will try to tell you about them - the thought of even more traffic is a little daunting...\"\n\nInvestec will have complete control over the development and reports that it will look to erect residential and retail properties were further strengthened by the fact that WPRFU has agreed to a 5% share in all profits that accrue from the development.\n\nIn addition, WPRFU will also benefit from 3.5% of any resale of units that are constructed.\n\nAccording to reports, no income is expected from these sources for at least the first six years.\n\nBefore any development takes place, though, Investec will have the option of keeping the stadium operational in 2021 - even if the Stormers have relocated to the Cape Town Stadium.\n\n\n\nThat would open the door for Absa Premiership clubs like Cape Town City FC and Stellenbosch FC to play matches at the ground in the interim.\n\nPSL matches have already been played there this season, with Cape Town City FC entertaining giants Kaizer Chiefs in front of over 20 000 spectators in August.\n\nHowever, from a financial standpoint the more likely scenario would be that construction will begin as soon as possible after the City of Cape Town has given the green light.\n\nThe WPRFU-Investec deal does not provide the asset group with development rights to any of the residential properties that WPRFU owns in the immediate vicinity of the stadium.\n\nNewlands hosted its first official match on May 31, 1890 when Stellenbosch defeated Villagers in front of around 2 400 spectators.\n\nThe following year the ground, which now has a capacity just shy of 52 000, played host to the first of the 54 Tests staged to date at the iconic venue, in a match which saw the British Lions run out 4-0 winners.\n\nShould SA Rugby not award Newlands a 'farewell' Test in 2020 against an as yet unconfirmed mid-year touring nation or against Argentina, Australia or New Zealand in next year's Rugby Championship, Newlands' final ever Test will remain the 25-10 defeat to England on June 23, 2018.", "description": "The possibility of Newlands rugby stadium being demolished remains a very real - and likely - scenario, but the exact timeline for the bulldozers moving in remains uncertain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8919/b98a654ed3444172ac898bb4a28513fc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
