The IPO is planned for 2020-2021, but could happen by the end of this year.\n\nAramco\u2019s board last month decided that listing in New York, an option favoured by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, would carry too many legal risks, sources told Reuters. He had hoped Aramco would be valued at $2 trillion, before plans for the IPO were put on hold last year, the sources said.\n\nLondon, Hong Kong and Tokyo have also been keen to woo Saudi officials to trade shares in Aramco on their exchanges.\n\nThe flotation, which could be the world\u2019s biggest IPO, is crucial for Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil revenues.\n\nThe IPO plan has rapidly gained momentum in recent days and Nasser welcomed the appointment this month of the head of the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund PIF as Aramco\u2019s new chairman, Yasser al-Rumayyan, saying he brought \u201ca lot of riches\u201d.\n\nRumayyan, a close ally of Crown Prince Mohammed, took over from former energy minister Khalid al-Falih in a move to separate Aramco from the ministry, a step Saudi officials have said was important to pave the way for the IPO.\n\nThe separation aimed to ease transparency concerns, but some investors remain wary of Riyadh\u2019s continued control.\n\nRumayyan\u2019s position as head of the PIF, the body tasked with delivering Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s economic transformation plan, means a close link with the government persists.\n\nAmin H.

REUTERS/Satish Kumar\n\nAramco has this year taken steps to address misgivings over transparency, including revenue flows, by opening its books for the first time to obtain a public credit rating ahead of its debut bond. But an international IPO would garner more scrutiny, including over dividend payments.\n\n\u201cFor bond investors it\u2019s different, but for potential IPO investors a central consideration is being minority shareholders in a company so closely linked to the government\u2019s strategies,\u201d said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.\n\nWhile some investors welcomed Rumayyan\u2019s appointment as a \u201cpositive\u201d step, others said it did not dispel concerns over governance given the economy\u2019s heavy reliance on oil.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be more of an alignment between the sovereign wealth fund, Saudi economic policies and Aramco\u00b4s potential new role there. This link is what ... we need to be monitoring carefully,\u201d Sergey Dergachev, a manager of emerging market corporate debt at Germany-based Union Investment, said.\n\nNasser said Aramco would have an \u201carms-length\u201d relationship with the energy ministry with the appointment of oil veteran Prince Abdulaziz as energy minister.\n\n\u201cThe guidelines for production are going to come from the ministry, there is no change when it comes to production targets or maximum sustained capacity,\u201d Nasser added\n\nCLEANER ENERGY\n\nNasser told the World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi that oil and gas will remain at the heart of the global energy mix for decades to come and that Aramco was also taking steps to meet the climate challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have heard loud and clear the call from stakeholders and society at large for cleaner energy. The world faces an incredible climate challenge and we need a bold response to match,\u201d Nasser said.\n\nAramco\u2019s upstream carbon intensity is one of the world\u2019s lowest, at about 10 kilograms of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent, and based on third party verification of greenhouse gas emissions, its methane intensity in 2018 was 0.06% - one of the lowest in the industry, Nasser said.\n\nSince Crown Prince Mohammed first proposed a stock market listing in 2016, climate change and new green technologies are putting some investors, particularly in Europe and the United States, off the oil and gas sector.\n\nNasser said Aramco was investing in technologies to make car engines more efficient with lower emissions, to use hydrogen fuels, convert more crude to chemicals and capturing CO2 which can be later injected into oil reservoirs.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nHe also criticised policies that do not appear to consider the long-term nature of the oil and gas business.\n\n\u201cWe have already seen the impact of what I call a \u2018Crisis of Perception\u2019 on long-term investment, and if it continues supply shortfalls will follow as night follows day,\u201d Nasser said.\n\n\u201cThat would hurt the competitiveness of national economies, threaten their energy security, and potentially create social disruption - by making energy less affordable. The world can no longer afford such policy miscalculations.\u201d", "description": "Saudi Aramco is primed to float on international markets to complement a planned primary listing at home, the Saudi Arabian oil giant's chief executive said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428389970&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891MX", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
