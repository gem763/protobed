He maintains an \u201cextreme security protocol\u201d the NY Times\u2019 Rukmini Callimachi notes, and this is only his second video appearance in more than a decade. It comes at an \u201cinflection point\u201d for ISIS, she says.\n\nIn the video, Baghdadi acknowledges the fall of Baghouz, ISIS\u2019 last stronghold in Syria. After dominating an area across Syria and Iraq roughly the size of the U.K., the Islamic State now lacks a state.\n\nBaghdadi said the ISIS-claimed attacks last week in Sri Lanka were revenge for the defeat in Syria and vowed that \"there will be more to come.\u201d\n\nBetween the lines: \u201cThis strikes me as an attempt to shore up global community in the face of territorial losses,\u201d Joshua Geltzer, formerly a top counterterrorism adviser to Barack Obama, told the Times. \u201cI guess they considered the payoff worth it to show the organization hasn\u2019t truly been defeated, even in its core manifestation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe underlying message is not just one of survival against the odds,\u201d BBC\u2019s Frank Gardner writes.\n\n\u201cThe optics here are vintage Osama Bin Laden: the jihadist leader squatting cross-legged in an anonymous room beside a short, personalised, paratrooper version of an AK assault rifle, the quasi-military fishing waistcoat, the attentive companions calmly discussing plans, and the long, prematurely ageing grey beard (he is only 47).\u201d\n\n\u201cBack when Baghdadi ruled a state\u2014complete with a well-armed military, tax collectors, and health inspectors\u2014he and his top deputy spoke with grandiosity that inspired followers and irritated enemies,\" writes The Atlantic\u2019s Graeme Wood.\n\n\u201cNow, as an insurgent leader again, he has dispensed with the fanciness. He governed in poetry; he terrorizes in prose.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Baghdadi] is believed to be in hiding somewhere in the sparsely populated desert spanning the border between Iraq and Syria, where he avoids the use of technology like cellphones that could help his many enemies track him,\u201d the NY Times\u2019 Ben Hubbard writes.\n\nWhat to watch: In addition to claiming the Sri Lanka attacks, Baghdadi accepted oaths of allegiance from groups in Mali and Burkina Faso. ISIS and its offshoots pose a grave and growing threat in West Africa.", "description": "The world's most wanted man is back.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Ukf5y1PeFzdHn9MGrTMys24HfEY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/04/29/1556578483527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-29"}
