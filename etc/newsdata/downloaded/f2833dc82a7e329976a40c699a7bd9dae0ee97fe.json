treatment to correct her wonky lips.\n\nValentina Sidorova posted a video online showing her bloodied face which she says was a result of Dr Olesya Sokolan attacking her.\n\nIn the footage Valentina, who is in her 20s, claims she is being treated for a head injury, broken nose and concussion in Moscow hospital.\n\nHowever Dr Sokolan claims it was Ms Sidorova who attacked her.\n\n(Image: Vesti.ru)\n\nPolice said they were investigating both claims which involves them 'fighting' in front of shocked patients.\n\nThe extraordinary feud came to light with Ms Sidorova's video in which she says: \u201cI'm in the clinic now.\n\n\u201cI got beaten up by a doctor for videotaping (the woman doctor) punching me.\n\n\u201cShe started hitting me in the face and head with my phone.\u201d\n\n(Image: Valentina Sidorova)\n\n(Image: Valentina Sidorova)\n\nDr Sokolan did not initially comment on the incident but then accused the patient of behaving \u201cboorishly\u201d, swearing at her, then jumping on her.\n\nThe medic then said she reversed an earlier decision to do free corrective treatment for the patient after Ms Sidorova was unhappy with the work of another linked clinic, she said.\n\nShe accused Ms Sidorova of using \u201cobscene words..and provoking me\u201d using her camera, and \u201crushing\u201d at her which caused her to fall causing concussion and an abdominal injury when she was in the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nMs Sidorova, who had gone to the 34-year-old to \u201ccorrect\u201d her \u201casymmetrical lips\u201d, gave a different account.\n\n(Image: Valentina Sidorova)\n\n(Image: Valentina Sidorova)\n\nThe patient alleged the doctor was using an unbranded substance to inject into her.\n\n\u201cI asked why there was no official box and brand identification marks,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTo which she replied: \u2018Either you trust the doctor or not.\u2019\n\n\u201cI replied that I was seeing her for the first time and I would like to be convinced of the originality and quality of the drug, since I care about my health.\n\n(Image: Olesya Sokolan)\n\n(Image: Olesya Sokolan)\n\n\u201cTo which I heard the rude words: \u2018Get up and get out of here.\u2019\n\nMs Sidorova said she started video recording the argument on her smartphone .\n\nThe doctor \u201csuddenly pulled the phone out of my hands\u201d and then used it to strike her, she alleged.\n\n\u201cThe doctor hit me with strong and sharp blows to my head and face, nose, eye, and forehead.\n\n(Image: Vesti.ru)\n\n(Image: Valentina Sidorova)\n\n\u201cI started to feel dizzy.\n\n\u201cDr Sokolan tried to smash the phone against the floor.\n\n\u201cThen the administrators ran in.\n\n\u201cOne held me, and the second tried to pull off the doctor, but she kept beating me on the back of the head.\u201d\n\n(Image: Valentina Sidorova)\n\n(Image: Olesya Sokolan)\n\nMs Sidorova said Dr Sokolan then ran to hide in a utility room, and when she went to reclaim her phone, she claimed the doctor tried to wedge her arms in the door.\n\nShe said that as other patients looked on, members of staff claimed that she was \u201ca crazy one from a mental clinic\u201d urging them to ignore her.\n\nShe said she persuaded a patient to call her husband who then phoned the police.\n\nMs Sidorova filed a complaint to police and was admitted to Moscow\u2019s Botkin Hospital where she was diagnosed with a nose fracture, head injury and concussion.\n\n(Image: Valentina Sidorova)\n\n(Image: Vesti.ru)\n\nDr Sokolan graduated in 2009 from highly respected First Moscow State Medical University, the oldest in Russia.\n\nMs Sidorova\u2019s mother Yana Sidorova vowed to get justice.\n\nShe said: \u201cAll those involved, the beautician, the administrators, and all the staff, will be punished\u201d.\n\nA friend of Ms Sidorova , Anna Nazarova told Peopletalk magazine that Valentia was \u201cterrified\u201d.\n\n\u201cI cannot conceive how this could happen,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cValentina has concussion, a head injury and a broken nose.\n\n\u201cShe is still in hospital.\u201d", "description": "Valentina Sidorova posted a video online showing
