I want to do that song, honey,'\" LaBelle recalled. \"Before I could say a real yes, it was in the movie and Whitney killed it.\"\n\nIn fact, she said Houston was the perfect fit for the track.\n\n\"I was so happy Whitney got that song and it just went like it did,\" LaBelle said.\n\n\"That's how show business is!\" LaBelle added, noting that she'd like to perform it in her live show one day.\n\nHouston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" won the 1993 Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The song is also one of the best-selling singles of all-time.", "description": "Legendary singer Patti LaBelle says she was approached about recording", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/patti-labelle-gty-jt-191030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
