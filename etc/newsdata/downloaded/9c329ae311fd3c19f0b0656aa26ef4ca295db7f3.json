I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did.\n\n\"So a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity, we're going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet.\"\n\nWhat is diplomatic immunity?\n\nAbout 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship.\n\nIt means that, in theory, they cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case.\n\nHowever, where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity.\n\nDiplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List. Drivers, cooks and other support staff who have been accredited to Britain (\"the receiving state\") have the same diplomatic status and immunity.\n\nSpeaking in Northampton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the use of diplomatic immunity in the case was \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nHe said: \"We would put every possible bit of pressure we could on the United States and if we could mount legal action on the United States, we would do so.\"\n\nThe crash in which Mr Dunn died happened close to RAF Croughton, a US Air Force communications station, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan worked.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley said, \"based on CCTV evidence\", officers knew \"a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton\" and was \"on the wrong side of the road\".\n\nMr Dunn's parents are planning to travel to Washington DC as soon as possible.\n\nShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the UK was \"getting the brush-off\" from the US as a result of \"cuddling up\" to Mr Trump.\n\nSpeaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Thornberry said the UK had been \"holding his hand... and being a Trump tribute act\", which flattered the president who is \"only interested in himself\".\n\nShe said although it was \"very unusual\" for the prime minister to ask for assistance from the president, Britain needed to \"hold its head a bit higher and look Donald Trump in the eye and be clear about what it is we want\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dunn family on Raab meeting: \"We feel let down\"\n\nNumber 10 said the prime minister had urged Mr Trump to reconsider the decision to allow Mrs Sacoolas immunity in order that \"the individual involved can return to the UK, co-operate with police and allow Harry's family to receive justice\".\n\nThe teenager's parents have described a meeting with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday as a \"publicity stunt\".\n\nMrs Charles said she felt \"let down\" by both the UK and US governments, while Mr Dunn's father Tim Dunn said: \"I'm deeply, deeply disappointed that they think it's OK to kill a young lad on his bike and they can just walk away.\"\n\nFollowing the meeting, Mr Raab said the justice process was \"not being allowed to properly run its course\".", "description": "Notes held by Donald Trump show a suspect in a crash that killed a teenager will not return to the UK.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qm4vy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
