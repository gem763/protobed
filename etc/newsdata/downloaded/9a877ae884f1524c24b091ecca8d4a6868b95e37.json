D.C. Police noted 14 locations that were blocked at various times Monday morning.\n\n\u201cI think that we were very successful in holding the majority of the blockades people had planned,\u201d said Kaela Bamberger, a spokeswoman for the Coalition to Shut Down D.C. \u201cWe significantly impeded traffic in some of the main areas we were in for about three hours.\u201d\n\nTransportation officials warned commuters to allow extra time and expect delays on their normal routes. Commuters were also advised to try to try other modes, including biking in or taking Metro \u2014 or the best bet, transportation experts suggested, might be telework.\n\nOn Metro\u2019s bus system, officials warned on Twitter that riders should expect delays on some routes.\n\nGetting redirected to the sidewalk by police: pic.twitter.com/YTeKLz92zT \u2014 Rebecca Tan (@rebtanhs) September 23, 2019\n\nActivist groups sent out a list early Monday detailing their plans for major intersections. Around 9 a.m., Shut Down DC proclaimed on its Twitter feed it had blockades set up in 22 locations in the District. There also were reports of traffic jams in Dupont Circle and rolling closures along Connecticut Avenue in Northwest.\n\nThe protester groups had said over the weekend that they expect their demonstrations to last until 11:30 a.m. Some protesters were beginning to be arrested around 8:45 a.m. along part of Independence and Washington avenues SW.\n\nD.C. Police said they arrested 26 people who were involved in protests because they were blocking traffic.\n\n\u2018I hope the politicians hear us\u2019: Millions of youth around the world strike for action\n\nProtesters at one point chained themselves to a boat to block the intersection of 16th and K streets NW in downtown Washington, three blocks north of the White House grounds.\n\nD.C. police used power tools to cut the chains off. They covered the protesters with riot shields and fire blankets as sparks flew, occasionally using bottled water to cool down the tools.\n\nWaiting to be cut from the boat, a 22-year-old protester who identified himself only as George as he risked arrest shouted to a reporter outside the police cordon surrounding the boat.\n\nHe said he worked at a nonprofit that tried to defend the environment. He had chained himself to the boat around 7 a.m. and wasn\u2019t sure when he would be cut from the boat or whether he would be arrested. He said the action was necessary to bring attention to the \u201cclimate crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing something that\u2019s right, moral and just,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing this so I can look my kids in the eye one day.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Johnson watched as the chain of a protester was being cut from the boat at around 8:20 a.m. The protest hadn\u2019t disrupted his commute \u2014 he\u2019s an \u201cearly bird,\u201d he said, and gets to work at a high-end downtown hotel around 6 a.m.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what the message is,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to get some signs up.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson appeared broadly supportive of any critique of the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re protesting in the wrong place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be two blocks up where that knucklehead is at.\u201d\n\nOther commuters seemed to take the delays in stride.\n\nSitting in a car at 16th and L streets NW, Jackie Hilliard tried to remain philosophical about her delayed commute.\n\nShe had been \u201cdetoured,\u201d she said, from an attempt to make a right on Rhode Island Avenue on the way to her job at a law firm, and was circling through downtown. The net effect on her commute wouldn\u2019t be that bad \u2014 just a 11-minute delay \u2014 but she didn\u2019t like being late to work.\n\nShe also didn\u2019t like getting that distraught about it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is what it is. There\u2019s no use getting upset over something I have no control over.\u201d\n\nAt least one D.C. school opened later Monday because of the expected gridlock. Basis DC, a downtown charter middle and high school, informed families Friday that the school would open two hours late because of the protest.\n\nBy 8:30 a.m. Monday, health-care workers and other activists had gathered at Folger Park on Capitol Hill. Members of Black Lives Matter had asked health-care workers from around the area conduct high blood pressure and glucose screenings in the middle of Pennsylvania and Independence avenues SE. A few passersby stopped for the tests at tents, which were taken down by 9:30 a.m.\n\nAnother group planned to make a blockade at the intersection of 14th and C streets SW.\n\n#BREAKING: Activists w Extinction Rebellion shut down intersection of 16th & K in Washington, DC by parking a sailboat in the street.\n\n\n\nThis is part of several disruptive #ClimateStrike actions working to #ShutDownDC this AM. pic.twitter.com/mHlHQXlOXA \u2014 Unicorn Riot (@UR_Ninja) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cWe will block key infrastructure to stop business-as-usual,\u201d the group Shut Down DC said in a statement. \u201cParents, workers, college students, and everyone who is concerned about the climate crisis will skip work and school and put off their other responsibilities to take action on the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, there were complaints from commuters of the traffic jams created by the protesters. Chett Huevos wrote on Twitter, \u201cNothing better for the environment than being the cause of millions of cars idling because you need a selfie.\u201d\n\nCourtney Mattison also wrote on Twitter, \u201cI don\u2019t care what your cause is, come for my commute and we\u2019re not on the same side.\u201d\n\nFor the protesters, Bamberger said more than 1,100 people signed an online pledge to participate.\n\nProtesters have part of Independence & 12th blocked off.

We are using what has historically been the most effective way to make change: nonviolence and civil disobedience.\u201d\n\nBamberger said the group did not seek permits.\n\nOne group of protesters said they were concerned about the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on low-income and minority groups in D.C.\n\n\u201cThis is directed toward Mayor [Muriel E.] Bowser,\u201d said Nene Taylor, a Black Lives Matter core organizer, adding that issues faced by black communities in the city, from gentrification and poor living conditions to the lack of access to adequate health care in Ward 7, are exacerbated by the effects of climate change.\n\nAs the crowd marched down 2nd Street NE toward Independence Avenue, their voices rang loudly in the empty streets. Some bleary-eyed townhouse residents peered out from their windows; several passing joggers cheered them on.\n\n\u201cThe house is on fire!\u201d the group chanted. \u201cPut the fire out!\u201d\n\nA D.C. police spokeswoman said no specific street closures were planned, but rolling closures were likely wherever protesters showed up.\n\nWhy nurses, America\u2019s most trusted professionals, are demanding \u2018climate justice\u2019\n\nThe planned protest comes after young people from more than 150 countries, including the United States, skipped school Friday, gathering in cities (including the District) around the world ahead of a United Nations climate summit Monday to urge policymakers to work more aggressively to take up climate change.\n\nClimate justice march has completely gridlocked Logan Circle.

Still, he wasn\u2019t worried about hitting roadblocks from demonstrations. He\u2019ll call passengers who might be waiting for him to inform them of delays. During one of the recent Women\u2019s Marches, Jude said, he suffered five cancellations from passengers who waited 20 minutes or longer for a ride.\n\nWhile he hates lost business, he said, he also sees opportunity from the demonstrations.\n\nThe Women\u2019s March provided some of his best fares because of the upcharge Lyft instituted at the time because of demand, he said.\n\nThe scene as climate change activists shut down intersections across D.C. share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Sept. 23, 2019 | Protesters block the intersection of K Street NW and 16th Street NW with a boat during a climate protest.
