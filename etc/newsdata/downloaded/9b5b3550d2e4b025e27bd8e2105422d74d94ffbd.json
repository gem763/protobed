Earlier this week, House Democrats issued subpoenas for documents from the Pentagon and OMB, hoping to unearth more details about the directive.\n\nOMB\u2019s decision to delegate authority to Duffey, former executive director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, despite career staff's objections proved so concerning that House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) and House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) broached the subject in a Sept. 27 letter to the agency.\n\nIn their letter, the Democrats questioned the agency\u2019s \u201cunusual and seemingly unprecedented step\u201d to delegate authority to a political appointee, \u201cin lieu of career civil servants who have historically been the designated officials responsible for overseeing and executing these technical budget documents.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not unusual for political appointees to be involved in the process, according to a senior administration official, who contended that Duffey\u2019s involvement wasn\u2019t triggered by legal concerns raised by career staff. The acting head of OMB can delegate authority to anyone within the agency on such issues, the official said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that Duffey was charged with holding up the Ukraine assistance after career staff questioned the legality of delaying the funds.\n\nPOLITICO first reported on Aug. 28 that the Trump administration had frozen the money, which is meant to combat Russian aggression in the region. The aid has provided a critical lifeline to Ukraine, helping to build out a ragtag army into a better-armed and professional force. OMB lifted the hold on Sept. 11.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee first found out about the freeze on Aug. 14. Staff then pressed OMB and the Pentagon for answers for two weeks, receiving little information. Only after POLITICO\u2019s story published on Aug. 28 did House appropriators receive a statement from OMB about the freeze on foreign assistance, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nOMB has contended that the administration only wanted to review the funds to ensure the money is being used in the best interest of the United States, while Trump has complained that other countries aren\u2019t paying their fair share.\n\nBut text messages recently provided to Congress by former U.S. representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker included discussion of whether military aid was being withheld from Ukraine to force President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nDuffey also helped orchestrate the Trump administration\u2019s push earlier this year to effectively force the cancellation of billions of dollars in State Department and USAID funds through a presidential rescission package, although the administration dropped that effort.\n\nKyle Cheney, Andrew Desiderio, Bryan Bender and Wesley Morgan contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b8/88/63e4cb7a48dc91a64166710bbc56/191010-trump-zelensky-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
