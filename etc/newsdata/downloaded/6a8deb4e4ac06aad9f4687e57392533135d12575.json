The appearance comes a day after Megyn and Rose McGowan both shared a selfie they took together, leaving many to speculate that the two vocal women were up to something\n\nThe two had previously interacted with each other when McGowan appeared on Kelly's show in May of last year to discuss the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein.\n\nThe news host is not currently connected to any major networks but has been using her platform to voice her support for survivors of sexual assault.\n\nKelly's post comes just days after she got into a heated Twitter fight with ABC News chief political analyst Matthew Dowd, who said that she and Matt Lauer should 'just fade away and enjoy their large pot of money.'\n\nCryptic: The former NBC news host took to her Twitter on Friday afternoon to post the black and white photo with McGowan\n\nHistory: The two had previously interacted with each other when McGowan appeared on Kelly's show in May of last year to discuss the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein\n\n'I really don't want to hear from either Matt Lauer or Megyn Kelly,' Dowd tweeted on Friday morning.\n\n'Can't they just fade away and enjoy their large pot of money?'\n\nDowd was likely reacting to Kelly's interview on Wednesday with Tucker Carlson on her old network, Fox News.\n\nClash: ABC News political analyst Matthew Dowd (left) ignited a Twitter feud with Megyn Kelly (right) on Friday\n\n'I really don't want to hear from either Matt Lauer or Megyn Kelly,' Dowd tweeted on Friday morning. 'Can't they just fade away and enjoy their large pot of money?' Dowd has since deleted this tweet\n\nKelly responded by saying that she chooses to 'speak up for women being harassed and abused'\n\nDowd hit back, saying Kelly was not as critical of Fox News as she was of NBC\n\nKelly alluded to the movie 'Bombshell,' which tells the story of how she and other women came forward to accuse CEO Roger Ailes of sexual harassment\n\nDowd replied that he would 'put my objectivity up against yours any day of the week'\n\n'I think the words you're looking for are 'I'm sorry, I was wrong'. Apology accepted!' Kelly wrote\n\nKelly then mentions that she wrote at length about the harassment scandal at Fox in her book\n\nDowd appeared to back down, tweeting: 'No matter how right I feel, it is not the loving way I want to be in this world'\n\nKelly replied: 'I am all for less meanness in the world. We're good'\n\nKelly returned to the Fox News airwaves for the first time since she departed the network in early 2017.\n\nDuring her segment with Carlson, she hit out at former employer NBC, belittled anti-Trump liberals and expressed exasperation about 'outrage culture.'\n\nThis all culminated with a closing segment in which Kelly warmed up to viewers at home by sharing the joy she is experiencing as she raises her three children as a full-time mom.\n\nNBC is currently the subject of a new book by one of its former employees, journalist Ronan Farrow, who writes that the network knew about numerous alleged instances of sexual misconduct by Lauer in the years preceding his firing from the Today show.\n\nFarrow also writes that NBC made large payouts to women to force them into silence, thus covering up the alleged misconduct.\n\nLauer was dismissed by NBC in November 2017 after a colleague came forward and alleged that he raped her in a Sochi hotel room in 2014.\n\nOn Twitter, Kelly hit back at Dowd, writing: 'Yes, I could just sit back and 'enjoy my money,' but instead I've chosen to speak up for women being harassed and abused who have been muzzled by NDAs.\n\n'Sorry you find that so annoying.'\n\n'NDA's' are 'non-disclosure agreements' made between a company and a former employer.\n\nIt has been alleged by Farrow that NBC made lump-sum payouts to women who accused Lauer of wrongdoing in exchange for their agreeing to keep silent about the allegations.\n\nAccording to Farrow, Lauer was fired by NBC after Brooke Nevils, who worked at the Today show, filed a complaint alleging that she was anally raped by Lauer while they were in Russia covering the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nKelly criticized her former bosses at NBC for not hiring an independent law firm to investigate the network's handling of Lauer and other alleged instances of sexual misconduct.\n\nAccording to Ronan Farrow's new book: NBC paid huge sums of money to numerous women who allege that Matt Lauer (seen above in June 2017) made unwanted advances toward them\n\nDowd responded to Kelly: 'Megyn, I am all for that, and if you read my feed you would know that.\n\n'However, did you stand up for Christine Blasey Ford, Anita Hill, and all the accusers of President Trump?\n\n'Also, I know you are blasting NBC, but I don't see you saying much about Fox.'\n\nFord is a professor from California who alleged that she was assaulted by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at a party more than 30 years ago.\n\nShe came forward to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings.\n\nHer testimony ignited a bitter debate over whether the allegations should deprive Kavanaugh of a seat on the Supreme Court.\n\nKavanaugh was eventually confirmed to the bench after a vote that was largely along party lines.\n\nAnita Hill is a lawyer who alleged that she was sexually harassed by Clarence Thomas.\n\nHill testified under oath before Congress during Thomas' confirmation hearing in 1991.\n\nThomas, who was nominated by then-President George H.W. Bush, was eventually confirmed to the bench as well.\n\nIn her defense: Kelly defended her coverage of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process, during which Christine Blasey-Ford (left) alleged that she was assaulted by the judge (right) at a party more than three decades ago\n\nClaims: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas (left) was also accused of sexually harassing Anita Hill (right) during his confirmation process in 1991\n\nScandal: Kelly also said she has written extensively about the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News, where former CEO Roger Ailes (left) was accused by a number of women, including Kelly herself and Gretchen Carlson (right)\n\nOn screen: Kelly is being portrayed in the new movie 'Bombshell' by actress Charlize Theron (above)\n\nTrump has been accused of rape, sexual assault, and harassment by dozens of women.\n\nKelly and other female personalities at Fox News alleged that they were victims of unwanted sexual advances from their former boss, Roger Ailes.\n\nAiles, the longtime CEO of Fox News, resigned in the summer of 2016 after allegations came to light.\n\nIn responding to Dowd, Kelly defended her record on speaking out on behalf of sexual harassment victims.\n\nShe tweeted: 'Umm, there is a whole movie about me standing up for the women at Fox. & I put Trump accusers on the air.\n\n'Also my job as a reporter was not to 'stand up' for Blasey-Ford.\n\n'It was to report fairly on her w/o taking a side. You should try it sometime.'\n\nThe movie Kelly is referring to is 'Bombshell,' which stars Charlize Theron as Kelly. It tells the story of how Ailes' downfall was triggered by the women who came forward.\n\nNicole Kidman stars in the film as Gretchen Carlson, who sued Fox News alleging that Ailes fired her from the network after she refused his sexual advances.\n\nCarlson's lawsuit opened the floodgates, as dozens of other women made similar allegations against Ailes and others at Fox News.\n\nDowd then replied to Kelly: 'Megyn, I wish you well.\n\n'I would put my objectivity up against yours any day of the week. You worked at Fox News.'\n\nKelly then mentioned her book, Settle for More, in which she 'devoted an entire chapter...to the harassment scandal at Fox and discussed it on virtually every network.'\n\n'It was a NYT #1 Best Seller. You should read it!' she tweeted at Dowd.\n\nKelly then suggested that Dowd apologize.\n\n'I think the words you're looking for are 'I'm sorry, I was wrong.' Apology accepted!' she tweeted.\n\nDowd eventually backed down, though he didn't take back his original statement comparing Kelly to Lauer.\n\nHe tweeted: 'I deleted the original tweet. No matter how right I feel, it is not the loving way I want to be in this world.\n\n'We have enough meanness and coarseness in the world today, I strive to do better each day.\n\n'I do wish you well and hope we can heal instead of hurt.'\n\nKelly replied: 'I am all for less meanness in the world. We're good.'\n\nDowd ended the interaction, tweeting: 'Onward. Thank you for that.'\n\nTwitter users appeared to overwhelmingly side with Kelly over Dowd, who has been a frequent critic of Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nSarah Stook tweeted that Dowd was 'dead' and that the 'cause of death' was 'Megyn Kelly's slams.'\n\nSarah Stook tweeted that Dowd was 'dead' and that the 'cause of death' was 'Megyn Kelly's slams.'\n\nOthers tweeted memes saying that Kelly 'annihilated' Dowd and he just 'keeps coming back for more'\n\nFrank J. Fleming slammed Dowd for his 'total lack of self-awareness'\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee said Kelly 'roasted Dowd like a marshmallow'\n\nKelly 'has obtained a certificate of ownership on that hack Matthew Dowd,' tweeted Brian Knotts\n\nSiraj Hashmi tweeted that Dowd 'failed to realize that Kelly was one of the first people who essentially got canceled by the right for confronting Trump'\n\nAnother Twitter user, Siraj Hashmi, noted: 'People like Matthew Dowd fail to realize that Megyn Kelly was one of the first people who essentially got CANCELED by the right for confronting Trump in that first GOP debate in 2016 and also for speaking out against Roger Ailes for sexual harassment.'\n\nWhile at Fox News, Kelly moderated a debate of Republican presidential candidates, including Trump.\n\nTrump attacked Kelly, calling her 'sick' and 'overrated'.\n\nDuring another media interview, Trump also made crude remarks about Kelly's menstrual cycle.\n\nBrian Knotts tweeted: 'I'm not really a Megyn Kelly fan, but she has obtained a certificate of ownership on that hack Matthew Dowd.'\n\nAnother Twitter user who commented on the Kelly-Dowd spat noted: 'The difference between NBC and Fox is that Fox had an independent investigation outside of house while idiots like Matthew Dowd are cool whatabouting Megyn Kelly protecting his paycheck. Gross.'\n\nFrank J. Fleming tweeted: 'I have so much trouble believing Matthew Dowd is a real person. His total lack of self-awareness always seems like a bit.'\n\nMike Huckabee, a former GOP presidential candidate who was governor of Arkansas, tweeted: 'Enjoyed seeing Megyn Kelly stand up and roast Matthew Dowd like a marshmallow after he ridiculously attacked her integrity as a journalist and person. The takedown was epic.\n\n'Don't mess with Megyn Kelly! She's smarter, tougher, and more fair than Dowd will ever be.'", "description": "Megyn Kelly was spotted enjoying a stroll with her labrador puppy on Saturday, in New York City.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/12/20242486-0-image-a-26_1572179226128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
