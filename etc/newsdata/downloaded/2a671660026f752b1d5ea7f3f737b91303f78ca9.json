Its residents were bused out to local primary schools by day and brought back in the evenings. It sounds like something out of a Victorian novel, I say. \u201cOh yes, it was very Dickensian,\u201d he says, cheerfully. \u201cBut I actually had a good time. The other children were the brothers and sisters that I didn\u2019t have. I don\u2019t remember it being bad.\u201d\n\nWhen Strong was 11, his mother, who worked as an au pair and in a clothing factory, moved to Munich for work. So she sent her son, who was born Marco Guiseppe Salussolia (his Italian father left when he was an infant), to another state-sponsored boarding school, this time in Norfolk. Had he not been institutionalised for most of his childhood, Strong doubts he would have made it as an actor. Along with making him self-sufficient, he also learnt to be a chameleon. \u201cI took who I was to become from the people around me,\u201d he says. \u201cI took on roles as a way to survive.\u201d\n\nStrong is now 56 and one of the hardest-working actors in the business. Look at his CV and it would probably be quicker to list the films and TV series he hasn\u2019t been in, as opposed to the ones that he has. More often in supporting roles than the lead, he has nonetheless stolen the show in major-league movies such as RocknRolla, Sherlock Holmes, Green Lantern, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Imitation Game, the Kingsmen series and the DC comedy, Shazam! His specialism is cartoon villains, spies, hired henchmen and bloodthirsty bosses. In Syriana, he was a Lebanese assassin who delighted in pulling out George Clooney\u2019s fingernails, while in Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s Al-Qaeda thriller Zero Dark Thirty, he yells at a room full of CIA operatives: \u201cBring me people to kill.\u201d When I ask if, just once, he\u2019d like to play a big softie, maybe star in a romcom, he shakes his head. \u201cGod no. When I started acting it was always about being someone I\u2019m not. I never wanted to play myself, or anything remotely close to it. Obviously, I don\u2019t go around at home threatening the wife and kids. I\u2019m generally quite a nice person in real life, so to pretend to be that dark character is quite delicious.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Suited, and with scrupulously shined shoes, Strong has dressed up for what is a rare series of interviews. A generally private person, he says he avoids talking to the press where possible \u2013 \u201cno offence to you\u201d, he adds, kindly. But he is making an exception for his latest project, Temple, a smart, offbeat Sky One drama series in which he stars and is co-producer. He plays a surgeon who, driven by his wife\u2019s seemingly untreatable illness, sets up an illegal clinic in the abandoned tunnels underneath the eponymous London Underground station. Aided by Daniel Mays\u2019s catastrophist transport worker and Carice Van Houten\u2019s medical researcher, he ends up tending to criminals and ne\u2019er-do-wells who are unable to seek medical assistance through the usual channels.\n\nProduced by Strong\u2019s partner, Liza Marshall, the series is adapted from a critically acclaimed Norwegian drama, Valkyrien. Strong and Marshall had watched it at home and liked it so much that they immediately began phoning around to see if anyone had the rights to it. \u201cTwo days later we got on a plane to Oslo,\u201d recalls Strong. \u201cA big American company was after the show, but it turned out they hadn\u2019t actually asked if they could have it. They\u2019d already started talking to distributors, and I think the Norwegians were a little miffed. We came in with a big heart and said we loved it, which we did, and they let us take it and run with it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing good about being the centre of attention and having people pry into your private life... The social media maw needs to be fed, and if someone doesn\u2019t get their picture with you then they\u2019re not happy\n\nValkyrien was named after a disused tube station in Oslo; it was Strong\u2019s idea that they rename the series Temple \u2013 \u201cI literally had to go over the underground map and find a suitable name, and Totteridge & Whetson wasn\u2019t cutting it.\u201d To his surprise, Transport for London allowed them to shoot in the disused Aldwych tube station. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary. There\u2019s miles and miles of abandoned tunnels. Imagine carrying a camera dolly, which is incredibly heavy, all the way down there. The lifts don\u2019t work underneath Aldwych and The Strand, so the guys had to carry this stuff up and down hundreds of stairs.\u201d\n\nStrong is delighted to be back working in television where stories can be stretched over eight hours or more and allow for greater nuance. \u201cIt\u2019s about mining a character and being able to take it wherever you want. With Temple, we have a second series for which we\u2019ve written a treatment that springboards off the first series, and what\u2019s been amazing is realising you can just let your imagination fly. Film is a much tighter snapshot, so its excellence comes from being able to tell a story with a number of small scenes within a two-hour time limit.\u201d\n\nHe notes that actors will follow the best writers, which is why we are currently seeing so many Hollywood stalwarts turning to television, among them Nicole Kidman, Emma Stone and Meryl Streep. Asked if cinema\u2019s current obsession with CGI-heavy spectacle makes it less creative, he replies: \u201cHmmm, maybe\u201d and leaves it at that. It\u2019s probably an unfair question, given that much of Strong\u2019s career has been taken up working with green screens in place of people and scenery. Does that get a little wearing? \u201cNot really,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, the whole job is make-believe. If we were doing a scene right now, there\u2019d be a camera there\u201d \u2013 he points at a chair \u2013 \u201cand there\u2019d be a clapper loader standing there, and someone on the phone over there. There\u2019d be cables everywhere. So the whole green screen thing is just an extension of that. If you\u2019re being attacked by a big monster, you\u2019ve just got to imagine the big monster.\u201d\n\nHe recalls the 2007 fantasy, Stardust, based on the Neil Gaiman novel, in which he and the actor Charlie Cox did a battle scene with a load of tennis balls on poles. His role as the leather-clad super-villain Dr Thaddeus Sivana in this year\u2019s Shazam! effectively meant four weeks in a warehouse dangling from a harness. It wasn\u2019t the most fun he\u2019s had, though he liked how it turned out: \u201cSuddenly DC [Films] realised all their stuff was too dark, so they made it funny, which was a good decision.\u201d\n\nHe tells me his sons, who are 11 and 14 respectively, can\u2019t get enough of Marvel movies. \u201cThey think Avengers: Endgame is amazing. I think the big screen now caters to CGI and the world of invention. I took them to see [Todd Douglas Miller\u2019s documentary about the moon landing] Apollo 11, and they were bored senseless. The first time we saw the moon [the shot] goes on for 20 or 30 seconds, which for a kid is forever. They didn\u2019t get the historical aspect and how amazing that was.\u201d\n\nBefore Strong became an actor, he was going to be a lawyer. He had gone to Germany to study law but did a year of it and realised it wasn\u2019t for him. He came back to Britain and found acting to be a breath of fresh air. After a year of rep (repertory theatre) in Worcester, he went to the Contact Theatre in Manchester and then spent a year at the RSC standing on stage, holding a spear. His apprenticeship was long and unglamorous \u201cbut I knew that I was watching people such as Ian McKellen and Brian Cox who knew what they were doing. That element of being known was irrelevant to me. Perhaps naively, stupidly \u2013 who knows? \u2013 I didn\u2019t use any of that to get on. I just knew I had to get down and work.\u201d\n\nAfter obligatory appearances on Morse and The Bill, he bagged a part in the landmark social history drama Our Friends in the North, named by the BFI as one of the 20th-century\u2019s 100 greatest television programmes, alongside Daniel Craig, Gina McKee and Christopher Eccleston. Where his co-stars were thrust into the limelight, Strong kept a lower profile, becoming a dependable character actor who has never been without work. He won\u2019t name names, but mentions friends from the Nineties who quickly became famous, and were miserable. He recalls going to their houses and having to close the blinds and sit on the floor to avoid the photographers outside. \u201cI see young people thinking fame is something they want to achieve, yet you listen to any person who has been famous and they hate it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing good about being the centre of attention and having people pry into your private life. Nowadays, it\u2019s like big game hunting. The social media maw needs to be fed, and if someone doesn\u2019t get their picture with you then they\u2019re not happy.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, he says, celebrity rarely serves the work. \u201cIf I am going to persuade people that I am a New York mob boss, or a head of the Jordanian Secret Service, knowing my home life and what I drink and what clubs I go to isn\u2019t going to help that. I want to stay below the parapet. It\u2019s a lot nicer there.\u201d\n\nTemple returns to Sky One on Friday at 10pm", "description": "When the actor Mark Strong was five years old, his mother, an Austrian immigrant in London, sent him to Reedham Orphanage, a state-run home in Surrey for children without fathers. Its residents were bused out to local primary schools by day and brought back in the evenings. It sounds like something out of a Victorian novel, I say. \u201cOh yes, it was very Dickensian,\u201d he says,", "authors": ["Fiona Sturges"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/12/markk-strong.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
