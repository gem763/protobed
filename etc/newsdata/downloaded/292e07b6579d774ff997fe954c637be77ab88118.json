REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nUK fact-checking charity Full Fact found that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s party has been funding ads on Facebook that link to a BBC article with an apparently altered headline that reads \u201c\u00a314 billion pound cash boost for schools.\u201d\n\nThe actual BBC story is headlined \u201cSchool spending: Multi-billion pound cash boost announced,\u201d and instead puts the number at \u00a37.1 billion, criticizing the government\u2019s use of \u00a314 billion pound figure as not the usual way of calculating spending.\n\nFull Fact, which is part of the third-party fact-checking programme created by Facebook to fight misinformation on the platform, said it had been scrutinizing online advertising ahead of a possible snap election in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong for the work of independent journalists to be altered in this way and misleading for readers,\u201d said Will Moy, chief executive of Full Fact.\n\nThe charity said it had raised its concerns with Facebook. A Facebook spokesman said the company was looking into the ads in question.\n\nThe Conservative Party and the BBC did not immediately reply to requests for comment, but the article\u2019s author, BBC journalist Sean Coughlan, pointed out on Twitter that \u201cthe only reference to the \u00a314bn figure in the story is from the head of stats saying it\u2019s not a correct figure to use.\u201d\n\nThe story included analysis from Robert Cuffe, the BBC\u2019s head of statistics, who said that the government was not calculating the spending increase in the normal way.\n\n\u201cDescribing this as a \u00a314bn increase would make the government seem more generous than it is in fact being,\u201d Cuffe wrote in the analysis.\n\nFull Fact said that the BBC told the fact-checkers that it had never changed the headline of the article. Facebook confirmed that headlines can be altered when running ads on the platform.\n\n\u201cWe are working to put safeguards in place to ensure publishers have control over the way their headlines appear in advertisements,\u201d the Facebook spokesman told Reuters.\n\nThe fact-checkers said that versions of the Facebook ad using the altered headline have been viewed between 220,000 and 510,000 times since Sept. 2. The ads were showing as \u201cinactive\u201d in Facebook\u2019s public ad library at the time of writing.", "description": "One of Facebook's third-party fact-checkers accused Britain's governing Conservative Party on Friday of misrepresenting a BBC News article in its ads on the social media platform.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429628671&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8D00H", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
