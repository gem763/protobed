The listing says that the goal of the restoration was to make this car look like it had just come from the factory, and when it was finished in 2017, that mission was definitely accomplished. Practically every piece of this car has been restored, replaced or rebuilt, which has resulted in one of the most flawless examples of a Metropolitan that you'll find.\n\nDesigned in the early '50s, the Metropolitan was at the forefront of small, American cars being almost a foot shorter than a Volkswagen Beetle. The 1959 AMC Metropolitan was powered by a 1.5-liter inline-four and a column-shifted three-speed manual, while the exterior of this '59 Met has a stylish two-tone paint job with the signature drop-down body accent running down the side of the car. The interior of this Metropolitan is as flawless as the rest of the car with a fine attention to detail including the houndstooth seats, the large steering wheel and glossy black dashboard.\n\nThis fully restored 1959 AMC Metropolitan will be auctioned off at the Winter 2019 Raleigh Classic (December 6 - 7) along with a wide variety of other classic and collectible vehicles that will be crossing the auction block. If you want a shot at being the winning bidder for this cute, fun-loving small car, then be sure you're registered to bid.\n\nMore From Raleigh Classic Car Auctions...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "A lot of classic attitude stuffed into a small packed.The AMC Metropolitan might be one of the quirkiest classic cars ever coming out of the need for a fuel-efficient personal vehicle.
