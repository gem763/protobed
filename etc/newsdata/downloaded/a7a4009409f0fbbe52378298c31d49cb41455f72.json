The Needham analyst sees YouTube getting a high value as a pure-play streaming company, while also having better employee retention and more direct accountability from YouTube's leadership.\n\nIf YouTube becomes a $300 billion standalone company, it would rank as one of the 15 biggest companies in the S&P 500 \u2013 with a market value greater than Exxon Mobil or Bank of America. Specifically, it would rank as the 13th biggest company just behind Procter & Gamble's $307 billion market value.\n\nAlphabet's total market cap is nearly $900 billion, third behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\n\"YouTube would trade at $300B as a separate public company because streaming and growth investors will NOT buy the GOOGL conglomerate, but would pay 10x EV/Revs for an independent YouTube (Roku's multiple), we believe,\" Martin said.\n\nAlphabet reported third-quarter earnings after markets closed on Monday of $10.12 a share, below the $12.42 a share expected according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\n\u2013 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "description": "If YouTube becomes a $300 billion standalone company, it would rank as one of the top 20 biggest companies in the S&P 500", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104879048-GettyImages-628010450.jpg?v=1556086396", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
