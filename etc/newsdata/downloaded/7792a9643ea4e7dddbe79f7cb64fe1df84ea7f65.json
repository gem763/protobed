It has been arguably the most aggressive state in expanding access to long-acting forms of birth control, like IUDs and other implants. Less than a decade ago, Delaware had the nation\u2019s highest rate of unplanned pregnancies, and its governor at the time \u2014 Jack Markell, a Democrat \u2014 came to believe it was a major cause of economic hardship for mothers and their families.\n\n\u201cWe launched this effort several years ago because we feel so strongly about the link between unintended pregnancies and reduced economic opportunities,\u201d Markell told me yesterday.\n\nOr as PBS NewsHour has put it: \u201cContraceptives allow women greater control of whether and when to become mothers. As a result, they improve women\u2019s ability to invest in their education and careers, which can have a positive impact on lifelong earnings.\u201d\n\nIn a Times story last year, Margot Sanger-Katz described the program that Delaware has created:\n\nWhen a woman of childbearing age goes to the doctor in most places, she gets standard queries about her smoking, drinking, seatbelt use and allergies. In Delaware, she is now also asked: \u2018Do you want to get pregnant in the next year?\u2019 If her answer is no, clinics are being trained to ensure she gets whatever form of birth control she wants that very day, whether a prescription or an implant in her arm. \u2026 Working with an organization called Upstream, Delaware has rolled out the program to nearly every medical provider in the state over the past three years. It\u2019s having big effects on the number of women requesting and receiving contraception.\n\nThere is still a lot of room for progress, though \u2014 especially in states that have not been as ambitious about expanding access to IUDs.\n\nFor more \u2026\n\n\u201cThe 2017 abortion rate of 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 represented an 8 percent decline from 2014,\u201d Rachel K. Jones, Elizabeth Witwer and Jenna Jerman of the Guttmacher Institute have written. About 18 percent of pregnancies ended in abortion in 2017.", "description": "Clues from the state with the biggest recent decline.", "authors": ["David Leonhardt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/opinion/17leonhardt-newsletter-1/17leonhardt-newsletter-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
