A wave of revivals suggests we still have a lot to learn from its insights\n\nThe term \u201cgaslighting\u201d \u2013 psychological manipulation intended to make the victim question their sanity \u2013 has become embedded in our language. This year, accusations of gaslighting were aimed at Love Island housemates Michael and Curtis. In the Netflix series Jessica Jones, David Tennant\u2019s character played mind-control games with his victims (intensified by the fact that he could actually control minds). Taylor Swift even declared that the US public had been gaslighted by Donald Trump\u2019s politics.\n\nThe term derives from Patrick Hamilton\u2019s 1938 play Gaslight, which is itself fittingly deceptive. On the surface it\u2019s a Victorian melodrama, a real potboiler, but it is uncannily insightful and accurate in its depiction of an abusive relationship.\n\nThe play was the basis for a 1940 film directed by Thorold Dickinson and for George Cukor\u2019s 1944 film starring Ingrid Bergman. Along with his drama Rope, Gaslight made Hamilton wealthy. In the play, Jack Manningham manipulates and undermines his wife, Bella. His temper is constantly fluctuating; he dismisses and belittles her and, by turning the lights on and off, starts to make her think she is going mad. \u201cIt\u2019s so acute in its portrayal of psychological domestic abuse and toxic masculinity, but people can lose sight of that,\u201d says Richard Beecham, whose production of Gaslight is at Watford Palace theatre this month.\n\n\u201cPatrick Hamilton the commercial playwright could never quite leave behind Hamilton the literary novelist,\u201d says Beecham. \u201cHe was a complicated man and, reading his biography, it seems he had some understanding of some of the behaviours he\u2019s writing about.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s tendency to become infatuated with unsuitable women seeped into his fiction. His obsession with Soho sex worker Lily Connolly made its way into Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky. The protagonist of the Gorse trilogy is a predator, a superficially charming swindler who takes advantage of women.\n\nThe Watford production is one of several Gaslights staged this year. There have already been revivals at Perth theatre and the Mill at Sonning; a version starring Martin Shaw is touring the UK and another Gaslight is coming to the Playground theatre in London.\n\nBeecham was inspired by Safe at Last, a Channel 4 documentary that allowed cameras behind the doors of a women\u2019s refuge. His production has an all-female cast playing survivors of domestic abuse who are enacting Hamilton\u2019s play as an exercise in drama therapy. To prepare, Beecham worked closely with a women\u2019s refuge. The cast created individual backstories for the modern women they are playing and they remained in character when a care worker took them through a workshop designed for survivors of abuse. The cast are simultaneously playing the women in the refuge as well as Hamilton\u2019s characters, so when Bella delivers an impassioned speech towards the end, it becomes \u201ca sort of exorcism\u201d. This approach also means that, in the context of Beecham\u2019s production, a survivor of abuse is also taking on the role of the abuser, which makes the scene in which Jack attacks Bella more emotionally complex.\n\nThe character of the police inspector Rough, who is Bella\u2019s rescuer, can be problematic for a director today: he is another dominating male presence. In Kai Fischer\u2019s production for Perth theatre, a woman \u2013 Meg Fraser \u2013 was cast in the role. Beecham has merged the character with the figure of the drama therapist and has \u201cpruned the text to remove some of the lazy sexism and the patronising attitudes\u201d. Is there not, I ask, also an issue with a man directing a cast of women in a play about emotional control and power imbalance? It\u2019s something they\u2019ve discussed. Watford Palace\u2019s artistic director Brigid Larmour stipulated that if he was to direct it there would need to be an otherwise all-female creative team.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emotionally complex ...

Her version will retain the Victorian setting and look to horror for inspiration. She wants to \u201cpush the audience to feel uneasy \u2013 even scared\u201d. Inevitably, lighting will play a large part in this; she cites the film Midsommar as an inspiration.\n\nHaving first read the play 10 years ago, Corner was inspired to direct it because \u201cits depiction of abusive relationships has not dated and remains alarmingly relevant\u201d. The Crown Prosecution Service recorded 960 offences of coercive and controlling behaviour between 2017 and 2018, a three-fold increase from the previous year. Ninety-seven per cent of defendants prosecuted in these cases were male.\n\nBut Corner is concerned about the prevalence of the term in the media. It has become a buzzword, she says, \u201cbut also in some ways lost any attachment to the actual gravity of this type of abuse and the sensitivity this topic can require\u201d. \u201cNow is a very good time to revisit the play,\u201d she says, and \u201cconsider what \u2013 if anything \u2013 has changed.\u201d", "description": "Patrick Hamilton could never have imagined his 1938 potboiler would give today\u2019s world such a powerful term.
