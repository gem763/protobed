Chiu, like many who have weighed whether to speak out against sexual misconduct in the workplace, was silenced by a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nMostly there as an observer and unsure if she wanted to go on the record, Chiu said she felt inspired by being in the room with the other women \u2014 from Hollywood stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd, to McDonald\u2019s worker Kim Lawson and Christine Blasey Ford, who told senators last fall that now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.\n\nChiu went on to cite another reason she was considering speaking out about Weinstein trying to rape her in 1998. (Weinstein has denied Chiu\u2019s account, as well as all the other sexual assault allegations that have been made against him.)\n\n\u201cThere are very few, I feel, Asian voices that come forward with this kind of story,\u201d Chiu told the group, according to Kantor and Twohey\u2019s book, published in September. \u201cIt\u2019s not because this kind of thing does not happen to Asian people, but I think certainly within the U.S. we have a whole culture around a model minority that doesn\u2019t make a fuss, that doesn\u2019t speak up, that puts their head down and works really hard and doesn\u2019t cause waves.\u201d\n\nNBC via Getty Images Rowena Chiu (right) on NBC's \"Today\" show in September.

And in her memoir, she reflects on the ways being an Asian woman made her \u201cused to being unseen, to never being fully known.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did not feel possible that I could be the protagonist,\u201d Miller wrote.\n\nWhile their stories certainly differ, it\u2019s significant that both Chiu, born in the U.K. to immigrant parents from Hong Kong, and Miller, whose mother came to the U.S. after growing up during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, point to their Asian identity as a factor in their decisions to speak out and reclaim their stories. Their bravery helps defy the stereotypes against Asian women, and may reduce the stigma within Asian communities against speaking out about trauma.\n\nAsian women have long been exoticized and fetishized as disposable sex objects. That, coupled with insidious stereotypes of Asian people as submissive, meek, mild-mannered and the \u201cmodel minority,\u201d can make it difficult for our stories to be taken seriously.\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed published over the weekend, Chiu, elaborating on the account in \u201cShe Said,\u201d cited her race as a source of the \u201cpower imbalance\u201d between her and Weinstein, an imbalance that almost always figures in sexual misconduct. She revealed that he \u201cdefined me in terms of sexual exoticism,\u201d capitalizing on harmful stereotypes against Asian women.\n\n\u201cHarvey Weinstein told me he liked Chinese girls. He liked them because they were discreet, he said \u2014 because they knew how to keep a secret,\u201d she wrote, later recalling that he told her, \u201cjust before he tried to rape me, that he\u2019d never had a Chinese girl.\u201d\n\nBeing an Asian woman made her \u201cvisible as a sex object, invisible as a person,\u201d she said, citing the \u201cmodel minority\u201d stereotype, which often portrays Asian people as being accommodating and less likely to speak out.\n\n\u201cIn my British-Chinese family, we were afraid of standing out. I was taught not to talk back \u2014 to aunties and uncles, to my parents, to my teachers, to perfect strangers. I learned the social benefits of being deferential, polite and well behaved,\u201d Chiu wrote. \u201cAs with many Asian women, this meant that I was visible as a sex object, invisible as a person. Harvey may not have created this imbalance, but he and many others have capitalized on it, knowingly or unknowingly, to abuse women of color.\u201d\n\nMariah Tiffany/Viking Chanel Miller, author of \"Know My Name,\" about reclaiming her identity after her rapist Brock Turner was sentenced to only six months in jail.\n\nSimilarly, Miller has discussed feeling invisible as an Asian woman, and how Turner\u2019s position of privilege as a white man contributed to his lenient sentence from a white male judge, Aaron Persky. Persky infamously lamented that a more stringent sentence for Turner, a star swimmer at Stanford University, \u201cwould have a severe impact on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, in general, we are more likely to be dismissed,\u201d Miller said of Asian survivors of sexual assault, in an interview with Shondaland last month. \u201cI think our experiences are easily overridden, that we have to fight insanely hard to be taken seriously or to be heard\u2026 just to be seen, at all.\u201d\n\nBecause of her anonymity during the prosecution of Turner, many people assumed Miller was white, including court officials.\n\n\u201cI felt like my lineage had been erased. They had denied a vital part of my identity, my upbringing, and the entire context in which I live and exist in this world,\u201d Miller told Shondaland. \u201cThey assumed I was white and they checked that box without a question in their mind that I could be someone else. That\u2019s not [their] call to make.\u201d\n\nAs novelist Lisa Ko wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month, the assumption that Miller was white is \u201ca reminder of how often we internalize whiteness as a default in America.\u201d\n\nThat can make it harder for people of color to envision themselves in public roles, including coming forward to reveal injustices that will then be adjudicated in a system dominated by white people and often stacked against people of color.\n\nInterestingly, Miller speculated that, in the end, it was her defiance of the model minority stereotype that may have helped in the legal process \u2014 suggesting that if more Asian women make a fuss, speak out and cause waves, we might be able to work toward making our stories more visible, and chip away the insidious stereotypes that often render us invisible.\n\n\u201cI felt underestimated throughout the [court] process; maybe they saw me as differential or submissive,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut maybe, ultimately, that worked to my advantage because they thought they could get away with more, thinking that I was more soft-spoken rather than outspoken. But I know what I\u2019m capable of and I was not going to let that happen.\u201d", "description": "Both women have pointed to their Asian identity and the insidiousness of the \"model minority\" stereotype in deciding to speak out about sexual assault.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b6c102100002504330415.png?cache=fuwasahpgn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
