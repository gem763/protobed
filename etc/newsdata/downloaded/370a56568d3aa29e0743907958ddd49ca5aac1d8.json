But getting the back-five lads involved in wanting to know how we can get better is important.\n\nIreland turn over the Samoa scrum with huge drive #IREvSAM #RWC2019\n\n\n\nFind out where you can watch at https://t.co/z0BgdPH0sf pic.twitter.com/OyxhyqRMt9 \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 12, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen they know inside-out what we are looking to do, or looking not to do, even then you can feel the changes in their body shape, or pressure-wise, or even just energy before the scrum.\n\n\u201cYou know when they are on and ready to go for it. Luckily at the moment that is most of the time and everyone is clued in, so it is a nice place to be.\u201d\n\nHealy has managed to shake off several injury-ravaged years to hit back to top form and can win his 95th Test cap against New Zealand this weekend.\n\nThe 32-year-old continues to form part of a destructive front-row combination with captain Rory Best and British and Irish Lions star Tadhg Furlong.\n\nIreland have boasted plenty of power off the bench too in Japan however, with Andrew Porter and Dave Kilcoyne both hugely impressive performers.\n\nHead coach Schmidt loves to exploit prime scrum ball for a chance to roll out his specially-devised set plays, and Saturday will be no different.\n\nHealy admitted Ireland\u2019s pack always wants to give their talented backline every chance to flourish \u2013 especially with the ever-demanding Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton on hand.\n\n\u201cWe have such talent outside of us. It would be a sin not to give them a good platform to play off,\u201d said Healy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we get most of our pressure from, from nine and 10 barking at us if we don\u2019t get our scrum and lineout right.\n\n\u201cWe want to do that and put the team on the best platform.\n\n\u201cIf it means keeping the ball in the scrum and getting a penalty, we can do it that way, or having a solid scrum to get the ball out and let them play then we\u2019ll do it that way too.\u201d", "description": "Former All Blacks prop Feek joined Leinster as scrum coach in 2010 and stepped up to Ireland a year later.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/08/wire-19775980-1571210640-308_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
