BGR and The Points Guy may receive a commission from card issuers.\n\nPlease note: the offers mentioned below are subject to change at any time and some may no longer be available.\n\nMore from BGR\n\nOne of our favorite rewards credit cards for ordinary consumers is The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, which combines a big up-front welcome offer of 60,000 points (after using the card to spend $5,000 in your first three months) with a ton of luxe perks. The benefits range from an airline fee credit of up to $200 to American Express Concierge travel service, and much more. Business owners, meanwhile, fear not. The Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express is a companion version of the charge card tailored to the needs of business people, and it not only has a similarly impressive lineup of benefits.\n\nYou\u2019ve also got until December 4, 2019, to take advantage of a limited-time, increased welcome bonus of up to 100,000 Membership Rewards points.\n\nWho needs this card: If you rack up frequent travel expenses over the course of your business operations, or even if you simply charge thousands of dollars a month in business expenses to a charge card, it\u2019s hard to argue the Amex Business Platinum doesn\u2019t deserve a spot in your wallet.\n\nWhy you should sign up for one right now: The current welcome points offer means if you can put $25,000 in charges on this card in your first three months of card ownership (and before December 4), the 100,000 Membership Rewards points bonus can be yours. Yes, that\u2019s a big outlay in order to get the welcome reward, but since this is a business card we\u2019re talking about that\u2019s not an unreasonable amount of expense to put on a charge card.\n\nMoreover, based on the most recent monthly valuations from The Points Guy, 100,000 Membership Rewards points are worth $2,000 in travel, which makes this card\u2019s bonus an extremely lucrative one and potentially worth the high spending levels. We should also add \u2014 you\u2019ll earn the welcome points in two tiers.\n\nSpent $10,000 on qualifying purchases in the first 3 months of card membership, and you\u2019ll earn 50,000 Membership Rewards points. Once you put another $15,000 on this card (for qualifying purchases) after that initial $10,000 \u2014 and, again, still before the first three months are up \u2014 then you\u2019ll earn an additional 50,000 points.\n\nIf you read our previous post outlining the slew of lucrative benefits available to Amex Platinum cardmembers, you\u2019re already familiar with many of the benefits of the Amex Business Platinum. Both cards share perks like:\n\nUp to $200 airline fee credit each year\n\nAccess to Centurion Lounges and Delta Sky Clubs ( when flying Delta )\n\nAccess to other lounges in the American Express Global Lounge Collection\n\nGold elite status with Hilton Honors and Gold elite status with Marriott Bonvoy\n\nand Upgrade with Points to request an airline ticket upgrade on select airlines\n\n5 points per dollar spent on flights and prepaid hotels (both must be booked through Amex Travel on the Business Platinum)\n\nHowever, here are some of the benefits you get that are exclusive to the business version of the Platinum card:\n\n10 free Gogo inflight Wi-Fi passes each year\n\n1.5x points on purchases of $5,000 or more (up to 1 million additional points per year)\n\nA complimentary year of Platinum Global Access with WeWork (enrollment must be done by December 31, 2019)\n\nUp to $200 in annual statement credits for Dell technology purchases , split into a $100 credit for January through June and another $100 credit for July through December\n\nThe final word\n\nWhile this card does come with a $595 annual fee that can seem hefty at the outset, if you take advantage of the $200 airline fee credit and the annual up to $200 Dell credit, you\u2019ll effectively pay a net of only $195 a year for the card. This card proves its worth and then some for any businessperson engaged in regular travel. From lounge access at almost any airport in the world to elite status at Hilton and Marriott hotels, plus helping you get onto the internet while in the air during flights, this card has tons of benefits (not to mention that welcome bonus that\u2019s higher than ever) just waiting for you to take advantage of.\n\nBGR Top Deals:\n\nTrending Right Now:\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com", "description": "BGR has partnered with The Points Guy for our coverage of credit card products.
