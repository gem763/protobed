No more Jane Doe. I am Jordan Pruitt. #justice #metoo #SeeSomethingSaySomething,\u201d Pruitt wrote.\n\nReached for comment by Variety on Aug. 14, Thomas referred questions to his lawyer, who did not respond to a request for comment, the outlet said.\n\nLARRY NASSAR SENTENCED TO 40 TO 175 YEARS IN GYMNASTICS MOLESTATION CASE\n\nIn a statement to Variety on Tuesday, Pruitt said companies such as those named in her lawsuit don\u2019t do a good enough job of protecting their young talent; she said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Disney for the manner in which it treats underage performers.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, these large companies are primarily concerned with sales, money and charts,\u201d Pruitt told the outlet. \u201cToo often they fall short of protecting the young talent that they are \u2018supposed\u2019 to be caretakers for. Time and time again we see people in positions of power fail us. I couldn\u2019t be more disappointed in how Disney treats their underage talent like cash cows.\u201d\n\nShe said she hoped that her complaint will force Hollywood Records and Disney to \u201cspend their time and money on putting safeguards in place in order to protect the minors the are employing.\u201d\n\nPruitt first made her shocking claims in a lengthy Facebook post published in December 2018, in which she wrote that an important male figure in her life began \u201cgrooming\u201d her in 2006 while he was engaged to be married to another woman and she was just 15.\n\nAMID #METOO, STATES DEBATE TEACHING CONSENT TO KIDS\n\n\u201cThis all started when I was about 13 and the advances really kind of started around 14, but nothing was ever sexual until I was about 15,\u201d Pruitt detailed to Fox News in June in an extended interview. \u201cI can remember him saying, you know; 'Let me teach you how to kiss. You don't want to get out into the world and be a bad kisser.' I vividly remember that.\"\n\nThomas, is a longtime Nashville producer who has worked with acts such as Bebe and CeCe Winans, Amy Grant, Vanessa Williams and Yolanda Adams in addition to the dozens of other notable collaborators. In 2013, Thomas starred on a short-lived reality show called \u201cChasing Nashville,\u201d which aired on Lifetime and chronicled the life of four girls determined to make their country music dreams come true.\n\nLast week, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge sided with Pruitt in her request to name the parties involved in the suit.\n\n\u201cJordan Pruitt, like far too many child stars, was exploited by the very people who should have been protecting her,\u201d Pruitt\u2019s attorney, Keith Davidson, said in a statement to Variety. \u201cJordan\u2019s innocence was robbed from her as she was systematically groomed, molested, and controlled by a predator employed by Disney, a company that sells happiness to children.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe statement continued: \u201cDisney had a duty to protect Jordan from Keith Thomas, and failed at every step. Jordan can never get back the innocence that was stolen from her, nor can she erase the trauma of this tragedy, but she is committed to making sure no other young women fall victim to child predators employed and protected by one of the largest entertainment corporations in the world. Jordan is brave to find the courage to come forward to take on such a large conglomerate. She like so many victims with their own #metoo story must be supported. I am honored to represent Jordan.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she would be addressing her alleged abuser in her forthcoming book \"Abuse Anonymous,\" Pruitt confirmed she would be delving into the details surrounding her abuse \u201ca thousand percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just hope to see him in an orange jumpsuit someday on my television screen. That will give me my greatest joy.\u201d", "description": "Jordan Pruitt, a former Disney star and contestant on \u201cThe Voice\u201d has filed a lawsuit alleging her former manager, Keith Thomas, of sexually abusing her when she was just 14 years old.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/Jordan-Pruitt-8.jpg"}
