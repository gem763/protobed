In other words? The paper\u2019s reporters were attacked because they demonstrated basic journalism skills. It is, after all, not only not controversial to ask both sides for their views in a straight-news piece; it would actually be controversial not to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, the Post reports that \u201chundreds\u201d of students signed a petition calling on the newspaper to stop talking to ICE completely. Their cause was quite obviously absurd, and it depresses me that hundreds of our nation\u2019s (supposedly) best and brightest could actually be ignorant enough to sign something like that.\n\nThe good news? Rather than back down from the pressure, the newspaper stood its ground. Earlier this week, Crimson editors Angela N. Fu and Kristine E. Guillaume published a defense of the paper\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cThe Crimson exists because of a belief that an uninformed campus would be a poorer one \u2014 that our readers have the right to be informed about the place where they live, work, and study,\u201d the letter states. \u201cIn pursuit of that goal, we seek to follow a commonly accepted set of journalistic standards, similar to those followed by professional news organizations big and small.\u201d\n\nIt continued:\n\nForemost among those standards is the belief that every party named in a story has a right to comment or contest criticism leveled against them. That\u2019s why our reporters always make every effort to contact the individuals and institutions we write about \u2014 administrators, students, alumni, campus organizations, and yes, government agencies \u2014 before any story goes to press. We believe that this is the best way to ensure the integrity, fairness, and accuracy of our reporting.\n\nGood for them.\n\nYes, I understand how illogical it was that this was ever even a controversy to begin with. The truth is, though, we\u2019re now living in a culture where people don\u2019t always use logic. Particularly, the social-justice mob has a habit of just throwing around buzzwords instead \u2013 such as \u201cinsensitive\u201d or \u201cracist\u201d or \u201csexist\u201d \u2014 and fully expects that doing so will be enough to silence their opponents. Worse? It often works. Often, when the mob accuses a person of doing something offensive, the knee-jerk response is an apology. The pressure, after all, can be very intense \u2014 no one wants to be smeared, or even canceled, and sometimes an apology can seem like the only way out.\n\nI\u2019m glad to see that the Harvard Crimson didn\u2019t do this. These student editors stood up not only for journalism specifically, but also for logic in general. They rejected the idea that the offended person is always right, simply because he or she is offended. Not only is this great news on its own, but I also hope it will inspire others to stand up for what\u2019s right in the future \u2014 rather than making the social-justice mob more powerful by caving to it out of fear.", "description": "The Harvard Crimson was criticized for asking ICE officials for comment in a story about an \"Abolish ICE\" protest.", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
