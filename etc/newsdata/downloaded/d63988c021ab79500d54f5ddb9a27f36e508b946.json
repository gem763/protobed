The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure award -- or JEDI -- potentially opens the \u201cfloodgates\u201d for other government contracts, in the words of Bloomberg Intelligence, even as Amazon is expected to protest.\n\nShares of Microsoft spiked as much as 3.1% to an intraday record, while Amazon fell 0.8%. Thus far this year, Microsoft has risen more than 40% while Amazon is up about 17%.\n\nHere\u2019s what analysts are saying about the contract:\n\nCiti, Walter Pritchard\n\nThe \u201cnumbers impact is inconsequential,\u201d with only a minimal contribution to Microsoft\u2019s annual earnings expected. \u201cThis, combined with the fact the contract was awarded in a highly politically charged environment, makes the long-term impact of the award less of a tangible driver\u201d than previously expected.\n\nThe key will be whether Microsoft receives any follow-on awards or traction at other agencies. So far, Amazon \u201cappears to have a substantial lead\u201d in public cloud adoption, but \u201ca trend towards more centralized procurement of cloud as well as hybrid purchasing does put Microsoft on an even or better footing.\u201d At the same time, innovation at Amazon Web Services (AWS) \u201ckeeps those that prioritize innovation coming Amazon\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Bank, Karl Keirstead\n\nThis \u201ccould be the largest cloud contract award in history,\u201d and it represents \u201ca huge upset victory over Amazon Web Services.\u201d\n\nAffirms buy rating on Microsoft, raises price target to $160 from $155.\n\nStifel, Brad Reback\n\nThis \u201cgreat win\u201d for Microsoft \u201cvalidates Azure as a leading hyperscale cloud and signals that Azure continues to gain ground on AWS.\u201d\n\nThere is \u201cplenty of opportunity for similar size (or even larger) deals like this available across enterprises,\u201d and over time, \u201cAzure has the potential to be Microsoft\u2019s largest revenue stream and profit pool.\u201d\n\nBuy rating and $160 price target on Microsoft.\n\nOppenheimer, Matt Wilson\n\nThis puts Microsoft \u201cin the pole position to win other government and enterprise contracts.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cpolitics likely played a key role\u201d in the decision to choose Microsoft over Amazon, it is still \u201cevidence of the progress MSFT has made to catch up to AWS, which had a multi-year head start.\u201d\n\nJMP Securities, Ronald Josey\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s win \u201chighlights just how competitive the cloud market is becoming,\u201d and will likely help the company build out its public-sector business. \u201cThat\u2019s the longer-term concern for AWS.\u201d\n\nExpects Amazon \u201cto vigorously protest this contract,\u201d a process that could last years.\n\nDespite not winning, Amazon \u201cremains the leader in terms of size, scale, and, importantly, innovation across the cloud space.\u201d Would take advantage of any \u201csignificant dislocation\u201d in Amazon shares as a result of this announcement.\n\nAffirms market-outperform rating and $2,250 price target on Amazon shares.\n\nCowen, Nick Yako\n\nThe award \u201cwill likely have significant implications in terms of the [long-term] trajectory of [Microsoft\u2019s] Azure business,\u201d as the contract\u2019s potential \u201crepresents significant upside\u201d relative to the current size of the business.\n\n\u201cThe animus between President Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos raises the level of intrigue,\u201d and given the political elements, \u201cwe would not firmly count this in the Microsoft win column until the protest window has closed at the Government Accountability Office.\u201d\n\nBernstein, Mark Moerdler\n\n\u201cWhile the initial revenue generated by the contract will be reasonably small,\u201d the overall impact on Azure \u201ccould be quite significant.\u201d\n\nOutperform rating, $167 price target on Microsoft.\n\nWedbush, Daniel Ives\n\nThis is \u201ca paradigm changer for Microsoft,\u201d a \u201clandmark win that will change the cloud computing battle over the next decade. It\u2019s a shocker to Amazon and Bezos to lose it.\u201d\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\nThe contract is \u201clikely to open [the] floodgates\u201d in terms of Microsoft\u2019s potential government awards. The win \u201cgives it key new opportunities in the federal market, but also with state and local governments across the globe, where use is significantly behind commercial counterparts.\u201d\n\n- Analyst Anurag Rana\n\n- Click here for the research\n\n(Updates stock to market open in third paragraph, adds comments from Deutsche Bank, Oppenheimer and Stifel)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. shares jumped to an all-time high on Monday, after the company secured a $10 billion Pentagon contract for cloud-computing services, beating out Amazon.com Inc., which had recently been seen as the favorite to win.Analysts wrote that while the dollar-amount of the deal", "authors": ["Ryan Vlastelica"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FIpv5__A4RQ1Z2CeM91r0A--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/e90858b933d0662f8bc446dddce2638c", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
