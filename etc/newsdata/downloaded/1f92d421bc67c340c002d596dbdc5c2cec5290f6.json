Pre-tax profit at Europe's biggest bank by assets was $4.8 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, down from $5.9 billion a year earlier, HSBC said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday. The profit was lower than the $5.3 billion average of analysts' estimates compiled by the bank.
