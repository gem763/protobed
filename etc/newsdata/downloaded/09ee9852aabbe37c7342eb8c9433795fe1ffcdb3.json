REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by months of sometimes violent unrest, prompted by anger over planned legislation to allow extraditions to China, but broadening into calls for democracy and for Communist rulers in Beijing to leave the city alone.\n\n\u201cAnti-government fanatics are planning massive terror attacks, including blowing up gas pipes, in Hong Kong on September 11,\u201d the Hong Kong edition of the China Daily said on its Facebook page, alongside a picture of the hijacked airliner attacks on the twin towers in New York.\n\n\u201cThe 9/11 terror plot also encourages indiscriminate attacks on non-native speakers of Cantonese and starting mountain fires.\u201d\n\nThe post said \u201cleaked information was part of the strategy being schemed by radical protesters in their online chat rooms\u201d.\n\nThe former British colony of Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent legal system, triggering the anger over the extradition bill.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said she will withdraw the bill but many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is steadily eroding the autonomy of the Asian financial hub.\n\nChina denies meddling and has accused the United States, Britain and others of fomenting the unrest.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even need to do a fact check to know that this is fake news,\u201d said one protester, Michael, 24, referring to the China Daily post. \u201cThe state media doesn\u2019t care about its credibility. Whenever something they claimed to have heard on WhatsApp or friends\u2019 friends, they will spread it right away.\u201d\n\nThe protesters called off action on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn solidarity against terrorism, all forms of protest in Hong Kong will be suspended on Sept. 11, apart from potential singing and chanting,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nThe China Daily report was worrying, said another protester, Karen, 23. \u201cWhen they try to frame the whole protest with those words, it alarms me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are predicting rather than reporting. I think people calling it off today is a nice move.\u201d\n\nFAMILY FRICTIONS\n\nThe chairwoman of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, Pansy Ho, a prominent businesswoman and daughter of Macau casino operator Stanley Ho, said she was worried about violent extremism.\n\n\u201cChildren of all ages are indoctrinated with police hatred and anti-establishment beliefs at school and online mobilized to conduct massive school strikes,\u201d she told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.\n\nLam said in a speech on Wednesday that Hong Kong was grappling with significant challenges.\n\n\u201cMy fervent hope is that we can bridge our divide by upholding the one country, two systems principle, and the Basic Law, and through the concerted efforts of the government and the people of Hong Kong,\u201d she told business leaders.\n\nThe Basic Law is Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution.\n\nHong Kong airline Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has become the biggest corporate casualty of the unrest after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, the protests.\n\nCathay Pacific said on Wednesday inbound traffic to Hong Kong in August fell 38% and outbound traffic 12% compared with a year earlier, and that it did not anticipate September to be any less difficult.\n\nJoshua Wong, one of the prominent leaders of the 2014 \u201cUmbrella\u201d pro-democracy movement which brought key streets in Hong Kong to a standstill for 79 days, said in Berlin that the fight for democracy was an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cI hope one day not only Hong Kong people, but also people in mainland China, can enjoy freedom and democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe protests spread to the sports field on Tuesday, as many football fans defied Chinese law to boo the national anthem ahead of a soccer World Cup qualifier against Iran.\n\nSeveral peaceful protests are planned for the next few days, combining with celebrations marking the Mid-Autumn Festival.", "description": "Hong Kong activists called off protests on Wednesday in remembrance of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and denounced a Chinese state newspaper report that they were planning \"massive terror\" in the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428673308&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0WV", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
