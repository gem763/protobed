Always a laugh'.\n\nThe rumoured feud with Johns was only exacerbated after the two kept themselves at entirely different ends of the field during the NRL Grand Final broadcast.\n\nThroughout the game Molan kept to the boundary side for her reports while Johns featured on the four-man panel.\n\nThe weekend time slot will no doubt make it easier for the sports journalist to keep up her TV commitments.\n\nThe rumoured feud between Andrew Johns (pictured) and Molan dominated headlines after the Immortal is said to have told Nine staff he found her difficult to work with\n\nIt comes after Johns allegedly told Nine staff he found Molan to be difficult to work with and would not put his name to statements supporting her.\n\n'He just doesn't like working with her,' a television source told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nThat source said Johns' biggest gripes were that Molan giggled and spoke over him and other Nine personalities when they were talking about football.\n\nAnother source close to Johns said he did not know when the problems between the pair began but the footballing great would not be backing down.\n\nMany felt the rumours were further confirmed after NRL Grand Final featured both of the sports presenters but with Johns (right) sitting on the panel and Molan working on the boundary\n\n'Joey is a stubborn bastard,' the source said. 'If somewhere along the line she's p***ed him off he'll probably carry it around for the rest of his life.'\n\nDaily Mail Australia understands Johns point-blank refused requests by the Nine publicity department to put his name to gushing statements supporting Molan.\n\nThe controversy lead to backlash towards Molan with one fan writing: 'I would much prefer an immortal who can read and dissect the game and call things most others can't see than someone who has never played the game and reads the autocue'.\n\nFellow celebrities and friends of Molan lashed out at the response with Karl Stefanovic branding the fans 'gutless keyboard warriors'.", "description": "Erin Molan has announced her new venture on radio alongside Natalie Peters on Sydney's 2GB radio.
