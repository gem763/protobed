It then runs the profiles through an algorithm that scores voters based on how likely they are to be \u201csuper environmentalists.\u201d Finally, the group weeds out people whose public voting records show they turn out for most elections.\n\nWhat remains is a pool of registered voters who don\u2019t need to be sold on the realities of the climate crisis \u2015 they just need to be persuaded to turn out on Election Day.\n\nSOPA Images via Getty Images A protester at a climate change demonstration in Los Angeles in May.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Environmental Voter Project\u2019s more than 3,000 volunteers come in \u2015 to mail flyers, send text messages and knock on doors. The group deliberately avoids talking about environmental issues. Instead, it deploys classic persuasion techniques: shaming voters for missing elections that neighbors cast ballots in, reminding them when and where the next polls are, and promising to follow up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not focused on one election,\u201d said Stinnett, a veteran campaign strategist in Boston. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on changing the electorate.\u201d\n\nNext year, the Environmental Voter Project is eyeing 5 million new voters ahead of local, state and presidential primaries. By the time the general election takes place in November, \u201cwe\u2019ll still be targeting 2 million environment-first voters who\u2019ve never voted in a single election before,\u201d Stinnett said.\n\n\u201cWe expect that number to grow because millions are expected to register for the first time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group raised about $475,000 in 2017. Last year, it hauled in over $1.5 million. Billionaire Jeremy Grantham, the British financier who\u2019s pledged roughly $1 billion to climate causes, is one of the primary funders, as Grist reported last year. But about 2,000 donors gave $100 or less each over the past year, Stinnett said.\n\n\u201cNo one is going to confuse us with Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said, referring to the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s unrivaled base of small donors. \u201cBut this year we are raising money twice as fast as we did last year. People are really excited about this work we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe expansion comes as the climate crisis is emerging as a priority ahead of the 2020 election. Nearly 2,000 candidates for public office have disavowed donations from the fossil fuel industry. Millions of students are slated to go on school strikes next month to demand climate action. Even avowedly centrist candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination are proposing multitrillion-dollar plans to slash planet-heating emissions and overhaul drinking water infrastructure.\n\nWe\u2019re not focused on one election. We\u2019re focused on changing the electorate. Environmental Voter Project founder Nathaniel Stinnett\n\nIt\u2019s a dramatic reversal from the 2016 election, in which climate change was virtually ignored. But the shift comes in response to mounting evidence that the cumulative effects of centuries of industrial emissions are starting to show. Fires are burning from the Arctic to the Amazon to Central Africa. Greenland is losing billions of gallons of ice per day. Plastic pollution, an oil byproduct, is now so widespread it\u2019s found in rain and snow.\n\nAs of last month, 84% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said climate change is a major threat to the country\u2019s well-being, up from 58% in March 2013, according to a Pew Research Center survey released this week. That compares with 27% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, up from 22% in 2013. But the Amsterdam-based polling agency Glocalities found 58% of Republicans \u201cagreed\u201d or \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d with the statement \u201cI worry about the damage humans cause the planet\u201d \u2015 an 11% increase from 2014.\n\nThat kind of political sea change allowed the Environmental Voter Project to refine its model. Where in past elections the group targeted voters who listed the environment among their top two political priorities, it now only focuses on those who rank it first.\n\n\u201cWe realized there are now enough of those people that we can accurately identify them,\u201d Stinnett said. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t enough climate-first people, it\u2019s hard to build a model to help you identify them. You have to have a significant enough number. Now we do.\u201d", "description": "The nonpartisan Environmental Voter Project is doubling in size ahead of the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d68981f25000034008978c1.jpeg?cache=0bwmhklhsf&ops=1778_1000"}
