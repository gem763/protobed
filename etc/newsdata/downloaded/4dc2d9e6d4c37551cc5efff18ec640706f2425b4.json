His flaw, it\u2019s clear, is entitlement: Being born into privilege has made him think he\u2019s fundamentally better than everyone else. Thus, Eleanor\u2019s first strategy is to expose him to people who are more admirable than him. She arranges a panel discussion with other supposed Good Place residents, including a woman who somehow saved all the ducks on Earth (and, the woman shyly adds when pressed, all the horses too).\n\nBrent is unmoved. \u201cI\u2019m pretty interesting,\u201d he says when it\u2019s his turn to speak, before launching into an uninteresting life story of being raised in suburban Chicago and \u201cearning\u201d his spot at Princeton \u201cjust like my father and his father before him.\u201d His recalcitrance makes sense: If he were oblivious to the relative values of his accomplishments in real life, why wouldn\u2019t he be in the afterlife?\n\nThe next attempt to rattle his self-regard is more surreal: Eleanor and Michael engineer a cosmic hurricane of golf balls, SUVs, and Princeton tiger mayhem to make it seem as if Brent\u2019s presence has disrupted the workings of The Good Place. In Season One, a similar, Eleanor-themed storm amped her guilt so that she began to try and rectify the fact that her actions in life didn\u2019t merit heaven. But Eleanor\u2019s sins had stemmed from insecurity and a lack of self-worth. Brent\u2019s stem from the opposite. He sees the Brent-nado as a sign that he doesn\u2019t belong in The Good Place but rather somewhere better\u2014the best place.\n\nEleanor and Michael, realizing that their attempts to shame Brent into self-improvement have backfired, try more direct manipulation. They tell Brent that he\u2019s right and that there is a \u201cbetter\u201d Good Place that awaits the cream of the moral crop. He can get there if he tries, they say. \u201cIt\u2019s like a good deeds contest?\u201d he asks. \u201cThat\u2019s easy. I\u2019m going to crush this.\u201d He then gets to performing displays of politeness like picking up silverware other people have dropped and holding open doors.\n\nRead: \u2018The Good Place\u2019 is still TV heaven\n\nIs this progress? Michael notes to Eleanor that the problem now is that Brent is \u201csaddled with a bad motivation\u201d: He\u2019s doing good for selfish reasons. Eleanor replies that that was how she started doing good, too\u2014so as to not be caught. \u201cWe have to hope that over time Brent starts doing good things out of habit,\u201d she says.\n\nThat line plays as a reference to Aristotle\u2019s vision of morality as habit. \u201cWe become builders \u2026 by building, and we become harpists by playing the harp,\u201d the philosopher wrote in Nicomachean Ethics. \u201cSimilarly, then, we become just by doing just actions, temperate by doing temperate actions, brave by doing brave actions.\u201d It\u2019s a solid concept for The Good Place to throw on its lesson plan. But it also feels too abstract, and too simple, for the issues the show has raised with Brent. It\u2019s no wonder that when asked to perform \u201cgood deeds\u201d he defaulted to holding open doors for people, a basic chivalrous act. Chivalry can look like a mere habit that men are taught to adopt\u2014one that, it\u2019s clear by now, doesn\u2019t stop many men from acting monstrously.", "description": "A sexist boss arrives in heaven.
