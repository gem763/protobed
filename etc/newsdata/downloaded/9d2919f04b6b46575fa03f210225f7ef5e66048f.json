Lloyd pleaded guilty to middle ranged prescribed concentration of alcohol at Manly Local Court on Wednesday.\n\nLloyd told the court he didn\u2019t realise he was over the limit, after consuming four drinks in three hours.\n\n\u2018I had four but they were actually 1.8 standard drinks. It was by accident and I never knew that. But it\u2019s so easy to be misled,\u2019 he said.\n\nLloyd received a three month driving ban, and was fined $850. The magistrate also ordered his vehicle to be fitted with an alcohol interlock device for 12 months.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very sorry and it will never happen again. I will use this time wisely to reflect,\u2019 he said outside of court on Wednesday.", "description": "Bachelor In Paradise star Davey Lloyd has pleaded guilty to drink driving, after a random breath test saw him blow more than twice the legal limit.", "authors": ["Melissa Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-20-at-1.08.38-pm-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
