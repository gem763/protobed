The power line to Uganda would thereafter link Rwanda and then Burundi.\n\nAll the states, except for Ethiopia, are part of the East African Community trade bloc.\n\nNjoroge said the Kenya-Tanzania line was also expected to connect to Zambia, making it possible to trade power with Southern Africa, which already has a series of connections between South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, allowing them to trade electricity.\n\nPreviously, the Kenyan energy ministry had said the line connecting Ethiopia and Kenya was expected to be completed in 2017, while that between Kenya and Uganda was to be ready in 2016, and the Kenya-Tanzania one was scheduled to be finished last year.\n\nNjoroge told Reuters after his presentation the missed timetables was due to difficulties with land acquisitions on some sections for putting up the lines, known as wayleaves.\n\n\u201cSome of them (delays) have been caused by wayleaves. We have had some challenges with wayleaves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut there is none which would have been concluded (in that time).\u201d\n\nKenya had installed generation capacity of 2,712 MW as at end 2018, against total power demand of 1,800 MW. Ethiopia\u2019s installed capacity is about 4,300 MW.\n\nNext year Uganda is expected to commission a 600 megawatt (MW) hydropower project that will boost the country\u2019s generation capacity to about 1,600MW.", "description": "The power grids of East and Southern African countries will be interconnected in the next two to three years after completion of various high voltage lines, paving the way for regional trade, a senior Kenyan energy official said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["George Obulutsa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430813471&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0TI-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
