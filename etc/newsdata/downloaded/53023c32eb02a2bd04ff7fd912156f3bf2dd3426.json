(Joan Marcus)\n\nTheater critic\n\nHe\u2019s got a weirdly apt name for someone playing a character in a Disney musical: Jelani Alladin. And as it happens, he\u2019s also one of the most perfectly cast actors in a Disney musical, ever.\n\nThat\u2019s because Alladin \u2014 who plays the titular hero of the world-premiere stage version of \u201cHercules\u201d in Central Park \u2014 bottles this show\u2019s sprightly humor and musicality so beguilingly that any of the evening\u2019s shortcomings come to feel rather minor. In this cute if overly formulaic entry in the Disney canon, Alladin is the embodiment of Hercules\u2019s mythological strength: Late of Broadway\u2019s \u201cFrozen,\u201d he is certainly built for this assignment. He also evinces an outstanding fitness for the familiar, all-American entertainment values Disney audiences hold dear.\n\nThe actor sings and dances in the vortex of a massive undertaking in Central Park by the Public Theater and its highly regarded Public Works initiative, a seven-year-old program uniting amateur and professional actors. In this instance, eight Broadway pros \u2014 including Roger Bart, Krysta Rodriguez, Jeff Hiller and Tony winner James Monroe Iglehart \u2014 are joined on the Delacorte Theatre stage by 200 dancers, singers and community members. Their collective exuberance is harnessed by director Lear deBessonet and choreographer Chase Brock in a manner that itself is nothing short of heroic.\n\nDisney yielded up this property, which is based on the 1997 animated movie featuring the voices of Tate Donovan and Danny DeVito, to Public Works for a unique eight-day event. With songs by Alan Menken and David Zippel, and a new book by playwright Kristoffer Diaz, this experiment in corporate-civic cooperation proves especially felicitous. Over the years, Disney, which broke through on Broadway in the \u201990s with \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and, even more artfully, \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d has explored offbeat matchups of talent and venue for its myriad stage musicals. Some, such as \u201cAida\u201d (1998), found Broadway success, and others, including the desultory \u201cTarzan\u201d (2006), have not.\n\nThe attempts to refine a distinct pathfinding process for each vehicle led Disney in 2016 to ally with Signature Theatre in Arlington for the world premiere of a musical version of \u201cFreaky Friday\u201d; instead of sending it to Broadway, Disney licenses the show across the country for regional and community theaters. In November, meanwhile, Arena Stage will, for the first time, produce a Disney-spawned show, a revival of 2012\u2019s \u201cNewsies,\u201d a Broadway musical based on the 1992 live-action movie, also with music by Menken.\n\n\n\nIf Central Park had a roof, they\u2019d raise it: Tieisha Thomas, Rema Webb, Krysta Rodriguez, Tamika Lawrence, Ramona Keller and Brianna Cabrera in \u201cHercules.\u201d (Joan Marcus)\n\n\u201cHercules\u201d represents yet another permutation of a multifaceted corporate strategy, and on this occasion, the results reveal how a savvy director and an inspired design team can amplify the return on artistic investment. The show\u2019s paper-thin plot has to do with the young god, son of glittery Zeus (Michael Roberts) and Hera (Tar-Shay Margaret Williams), rendered mortal on Earth by Bart\u2019s snarky Hades, and smitten with Rodriguez\u2019s feisty Megara. It\u2019s a narrative scaffolding on which to hang some agreeably souped-up numbers \u2014 \u201cGo the Distance,\u201d \u201cForget About It,\u201d \u201cZero to Hero\u201d \u2014 that pulsate in the great outdoors, courtesy of conductor Michael Kosarin and a 10-person orchestra.\n\nBart \u2014 the original Carmen Ghia in Broadway\u2019s \u201cThe Producers\u201d \u2014 has great fun with the jazziest song, \u201cCool Day in Hell,\u201d backed by his comic minions, Pain (Nelson Chimilio) and Panic (the priceless Hiller, who no doubt popped out of the womb with a stand-up set ready). A girl-group quintet of Ramona Keller, Brianna Cabrera, Rema Webb, Tamika Lawrence and \u00adTieisha Thomas is trotted out regularly for the uplifting sounds of gospel and shoop-shoop; if the park had a roof, they\u2019d raise it. James Ortiz\u2019s outsize monster puppets (Hercules has to vanquish something) are amusing reminders of the musical\u2019s roots in animation.\n\nDeBessonet\u2019s production conveys the pleasing sensation of having gone all out, especially in the huge production numbers, when the stage is flooded with performers in Andrea Hood\u2019s rainbow of bright summer frocks: a Mediterranean rainbow of humanity. This panoramic approach dovetails nicely with the sentimental core of the musical, which is to say, it\u2019s okay to be human, with ordinary feelings and problems and stuff. And on the occasion of a version staged by one particularly gifted human, it\u2019s also fair to say that the theater gods have been kind.\n\nHercules, music by Alan Menken, lyrics by David Zippel, book by Kristoffer Diaz.
