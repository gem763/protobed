The feature first went into public testing in July.\n\nThe mode can be activated for specific accounts by swiping left on a comment, heading to your privacy settings, or doing so on the person\u2019s account. Restrict makes it so that \u201ccomments on your posts from a person you have restricted will only be visible to that person,\u201d according to a new Instagram blog post published today.\n\nSince the person isn\u2019t blocked, people will still have the ability to see the comment by tapping on a message that appears, similar to how muted replies on Twitter look. Account owners will then have the ability to approve the comment so it\u2019s public to everyone, delete it, or ignore it. Instagram is also removing notifications on comments that come from a restricted account, which is also similar to Twitter\u2019s existing mute system.\n\nRestricting someone\u2019s ability to comment will also affect direct messages. Any attempt to send a direct message will move to a message request, according to Instagram, and notifications won\u2019t be sent. The message can still be read, but restricted accounts won\u2019t be able to see when it\u2019s read or when the person who has restricted them is active on Instagram.\n\nThe \u201cRestrict\u201d tool is an additional precaution that people can take to protect themselves from harassment and bullying on the site. Instagram already allows people to block accounts and manage comments. Still, bullying is a problem on Instagram \u2014 one that the company has started to take seriously over the last few years. In an article published in The Atlantic last fall, heavy Instagram-using teenagers described the level of bullying on Instagram as \u201cconstant.\u201d Instagram is also encouraging its users, particularly younger ones, to take a stand against bullying and spread positivity with the introduction of a series of anti-bullying stickers arriving in the coming weeks.", "description": "Instagram is rolling out a new mode called \"Restrict\" that will let account owners effectively shadow ban a user who comments on photos with offensive or abusive language.
