He told members the union was increasing its strike pay from $200 to $250 a week.\n\nMr. Jones is under pressure to show strength as a Justice Department investigation into leadership corruption dents workers' confidence in their top brass.\n\nAt Detroit's Labor Day parade earlier this month, about a dozen disaffected UAW workers protested Mr. Jones's presence, calling for his resignation.\n\n\"I have zero trust they will get me a fair contract,\" Jeff Herrington, a UAW worker at Ford's suburban Detroit transmission plant, said before the parade.\n\nFormal contract talks began in July with all three car makers. In late August, federal agents searched the homes of Mr. Jones and his predecessor Dennis Williams. Neither man has been charged with a crime. The union has said it is cooperating with the investigation and the search warrants weren't necessary.\n\nUnion leaders pressed ahead with contract talks, and shortly after Labor Day, the UAW picked GM to take the lead in negotiations.\n\nThe week the UAW's contract with GM was set to expire, agents arrested another high-ranking union leader -- this one a close associate of Mr. Jones. The union leader hasn't responded to the charges.\n\nGM executives asked the UAW to extend talks, figuring the union's bargainers would want to push back the deadline, say people close to the discussions.\n\nAround 10 p.m. Saturday, two hours before the existing contract was to expire, GM added elements to its offer to avert a strike. Its proposal included wage increases, new jobs and a plan to salvage the Detroit factory, according to a person close to the negotiations.\n\nUAW leaders weren't convinced, telling members later in a letter that GM waited too long to make what they considered to be the company's first serious offer.\n\nRather than return to the table the next day, more than 100 union officials gathered in a windowless ballroom at GM's headquarters, where negotiators had been bargaining with the company, according to people close to the talks.\n\nMr. Dittes, the union's lead bargainer with GM, told them that the two sides \"were miles apart and GM isn't negotiating in good faith,\" one attendee said.\n\nThey held a vote on whether to strike. The proposal received a resounding \"yay,\" said people who were in the meeting. The \"nay\" vote was met with silence.\n\nWrite to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 20, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
