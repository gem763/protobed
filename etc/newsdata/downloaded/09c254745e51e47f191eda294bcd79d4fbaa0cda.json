(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) Associated Press\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Max Scherzer followed An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez's near no-hitter with a try of his own and the stingy Washington Nationals beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1 on Saturday for a 2-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.\n\nScherzer didn't allow a hit until Paul Goldschmidt led off the seventh inning with a single that left fielder Juan Soto played conservatively with a one-run lead. A day earlier, S\u00e1nchez held the Cardinals hitless until pinch-hitter Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez singled with two down in the eighth.\n\nS\u00e1nchez and Scherzer also began the 2013 ALCS with consecutive no-hit bids of at least five innings for Detroit against Boston.\n\nScherzer, a St. Louis native who played college ball for the University of Missouri, struck out 11 and walked two in seven innings.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier for St. Louis, either. Stephen Strasburg gets the ball when the best-of-seven series moves to Washington for Game 3 on Monday night. Jack Flaherty pitches for the Cards.\n\nSt. Louis got another solid performance from Adam Wainwright, who struck out 11 in 7 1/3 innings. But the Cardinals' inconsistent lineup was unable to mount any sort of threat against Scherzer.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: and", "description": "ST.
