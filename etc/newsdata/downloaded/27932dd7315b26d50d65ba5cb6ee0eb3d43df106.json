(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nDon\u2019t tell Apple the latest U.S.-China trade truce means the fight is settling back into a cold war. The conflict between the world\u2019s two largest economies remains as hot as ever for the tech giant.\n\nThe mini-deal the Trump administration is touting this week as the foundation for the next round of talks doesn\u2019t offer anything to the company. Its marquee iPhone, assembled in China, still stands to get slapped with a 15 percent tariff due to hit in December, turning up the pressure on CEO Tim Cook to win another reprieve from the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has been turning somersaults across the Pacific to avoid angering Beijing. It has taken a number of steps to keep its products from being used as tools of dissent from the mainland to Hong Kong: telling Apple TV developers there to steer clear of material that would offend the government; obscuring the Taiwanese flag from emoji on Hong Kong phones; deleting an app Hong Kong protesters used to avoid the police; and removing the Quartz news app from the Chinese app store for covering the protests.\n\nThe plight of the company highlights the complexity for U.S.-based multinationals of navigating the trade war\u2019s constantly shifting terrain. Corporations with billions of dollars invested in Chinese supply chains find themselves at the mercy of Trump\u2019s mercurial approach, forcing difficult decisions about whether to pull up stakes and move production out of China or hope for a peaceful resolution that restores the status quo.\n\nApple, which recently reclaimed its crown as the largest company in the world by market capitalization, has met the challenge by transforming into a lobbying juggernaut. Cook, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and was an early, vocal critic of Trump\u2019s approach to immigration, climate change and transgender troops, has established himself as a regular in Trump\u2019s inner orbit. The president on the campaign trail in 2016 urged a boycott of Apple products and threatened to send Cook's head \u201cspinning all of the way back to Silicon Valley.\u201d Trump now calls him a friend. The chief executive has also built relationships with Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, both senior White House advisers.\n\nTrump, Cook and Ivanka Trump. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe charm campaign has paid off for the company, allowing Cook to successfully press the administration for tariff exemptions for several Apple products.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tripp Mickle recently reported:\n\n\"With the threat of tariffs on iPhones approaching in August, Apple Inc. stood to lose billions of dollars in profit. Chief Executive Tim Cook reached out to one of his most important contacts in Washington, Jared Kushner. Mr. Kushner arranged a call between Mr. Cook and his father-in-law, ... people familiar with the call said, giving the Apple chief a chance to explain how tariffs would increase iPhone prices and impair Apple\u2019s ability to compete against rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co. Within days, the Trump administration scaled back its tariff plan to exempt a swath of electronics products, including iPhones, saying it wanted to protect consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season. The call from Mr. Cook influenced the decision, a person close to the administration said.\"\n\nThat reprieve was only temporary, however, and now Apple is facing the threat that those same tariffs will take a bite out of the company\u2019s bottom line in two months, just as it\u2019s rolling out the iPhone 11. \u201cThey\u2019re in a critical juncture,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives tells me. \u201cThey\u2019re in one of the most important iPhone cycles in the last few years, and the company is going through some growth challenges, especially in the smartphone market. That\u2019s why these tariffs would be hitting at exactly the wrong time.\u201d\n\nApple could absorb the cost of the tariffs initially but would soon pass them along to consumers, reducing domestic demand for the devices by about 10 percent, Wedbush estimates.\n\nCook waves as he arrives for the Economic Summit held for the China Development Forum in Beijing. (Ng Han Guan/AP)\n\nThe alternatives aren\u2019t much more attractive. Moving production to the United States doesn\u2019t appear feasible. A Bank of America analysis found manufacturing the devices in the United States would add 15 to 25 percent to their cost, \u201cand, if passed on to consumers could lead to demand destruction.\u201d And Ives says moving just 5 to 7 percent of the company\u2019s Chinese production to Vietnam or India would take 18 to 24 months. \u201cThey\u2019ve made their bed in China,\u201d he says.\n\nThe uncertainty is weighing on the company\u2019s stock, with Apple investors demonstrating their sensitivity to developments in the broader trade war. When an agreement with Beijing that Trump administration negotiators framed as imminent fell apart back in May, for example, Apple\u2019s share price tanked:\n\nThe decision about whether the Trump administration exempts Apple products from the December tariffs should fall to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. But Cook has appealed directly to Trump, CNBC\u2019s Kif Leswing reports.\n\n\u201cI had a very good meeting with Tim Cook,\u201d Trump told reporters after the pair had dinner in August at his Bedminster, N.J. property. \u201cTim was talking to me about tariffs, and one of the things, he made a good case, is that Samsung is their number one competitor and Samsung is not paying tariffs because they\u2019re based in South Korea. And it\u2019s tough for Apple to compete with a very good company that\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThat level of apparent goodwill compels Ives to assign an 80 percent probability that Trump will excuse Apple products from the next tariff round. \u201cThey\u2019re not out of the woods. It\u2019s a fluid situation and continues to be a black cloud over the stock,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been so strategic both within the U.S. and China. They\u2019ve played nice in the sandbox.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

WSJ's Sarah Chaney: \"U.S. manufacturing production fell in September, adding to evidence that slowing global growth and trade frictions are weighing on the economy.Manufacturing output, the biggest component of industrial production, fell 0.5% in September from a month earlier, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

Oxford Economics calculates the odds in a note to clients: \"Our modelling of the likelihood of recession using three different approaches, including one based on the leading indicators, suggests a probability of around 30% over the next 12 months or so. However, this could change rapidly. A consumer slowdown alone would be unlikely to trigger recession. But a combined set of plausibly sized shocks to oil prices, equities, credit standards and emerging markets, plus an escalation of trade tensions, could well be enough to lead to recession.\"\n\n\u2014 BoJo's Brexit deal isn't done yet.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 China throws cold water on Trump claim about ag buys: \u201cTrump claimed that he struck a \u2018phase one\u2019 trade deal with China on Friday and that the Chinese agreed to massive purchases of U.S. farm products. But nearly a week has passed, and China has not confirmed that critical piece of the agreement,\u201d my colleague Heather Long reports.\n\n\u201cAccording to the White House, a key part of Trump\u2019s initial deal is China\u2019s commitment to buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products. But nothing was written on paper, and China\u2019s Commerce Ministry would not confirm that figure Thursday, saying instead purchases would be made according to Chinese market needs.\u201d\n\nWhy the gulf is a big deal: \u201cThe dueling narratives from the White House and Beijing show just how far apart the two sides remain 18 months into a trade war that has brought the global economy to a perilous place and slowed the U.S. economy. Business leaders have halted investments because of the uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWhat it means for farmers: \u201cChina was routinely purchasing more than $20 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products a year before the trade war became heated last year, including a record $25.9 billion in purchases in 2012, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. But sales to China tumbled to less than $10 billion last year and remain on track for a similar slump this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina was routinely purchasing more than $20 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products a year before the trade war became heated last year, including a record $25.9 billion in purchases in 2012, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data.

WSJ's William Maudlin and Nick Timiraos: \"Trump\u2019s top economic adviser last week arranged an Oval Office briefing with outside experts who warned the president that continued escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions could imperil the economy and hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s chances for re-election, according to people familiar with the meeting.\"\n\nThe session, arranged by Larry Kudlow, included Stephen Moore and Lawrence Lindsey. Trump appeared to dismiss their warning: \"Mr. Trump countered that the Federal Reserve shared blame for any signs of a downturn, and should be doing more to stimulate growth. Midway through the meeting, he called in one of his closest China advisers, Peter Navarro, a trade hawk who believes the U.S. has been far too accommodative with China.\"\n\n\u2014 White House, Democrats not giving up on USMCA yet: \u201cThe White House and House Democrats are increasingly upbeat that the stalled U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement can be amended and approved in Congress, despite the rancorous impeachment inquiry into [Trump],\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019s Erik Wasson reports.\n\n\u201cI think it will pass before Thanksgiving,\u201d top Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNBC Thursday morning ...
