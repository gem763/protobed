The 26% downside is predicated on an expected accounting method that would lower iPhones' average selling price because of the new one-year free trial of Apple TV Plus.\n\nApple announced on Tuesday that it would give all iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Mac customers a free one-year trial of the service. Apple TV Plus is set to launch November 1 for $5 a month, or about $60 a year.\n\nThe anticipated accounting method for the TV Plus trial would bundle the yearlong period with the product at purchase. For example, an iPhone 11 Pro with the TV Plus trial would show up as a $1,060 purchase with a $60 discount applied.\n\nHowever, this discount isn't applied solely to TV Plus revenue. A discount of 5.7% \u2014 the proportion of $60 to $1,060 \u2014 would be applied to both the iPhone's $1,000 price and the TV Plus trial's $60 price.\n\nAssuming the phone isn't purchased with an installment plan, the iPhone would then show up as a $943.40 sale, and the TV Plus annual price would be discounted to $56.60.\n\nRead more: Top Wall Street investors say they're struggling to find big, bullish stock-market bets to make \u2014 and their paralysis might signal a meltdown is looming\n\nThis method would harm iPhone margins in future quarters as the lower average selling price arrives with no discount to cost of goods sold, according to the analysts.\n\nThe TV Plus revenue would then be realized monthly over a yearlong trial as \"deferred revenue.\"\n\n\"Though this might appear convenient for Apple's services revenue line it is equally inconvenient for both apparent hardware [average selling price] and margins in high sales quarters like the upcoming FQ1'20 to December,\" the team said.\n\nThe Goldman analysts added that the free TV Plus trial revenue would add 25% to the company's gross margin contribution. However, the overall lower product revenue would result in \"a negative calculated impact to EPS of 16%\" for the fiscal first quarter of 2020, according to the note.\n\nCuriously, Goldman Sachs is one of the partners for the tech company's new credit-card product. Apple Card was released in August in collaboration with the bank and Mastercard.\n\nApple disputed the Goldman note Friday afternoon, telling CNBC it doesn't \"expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results.\"\n\nShares pared some of their losses on the news, but still stand roughly 2% lower than the last closing price.\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, hit 11-month highs on Wednesday, a day after revealing a new slate of iPhones and updates to its Apple Watch and iPad products.\n\nApple traded at $218.82 per share as of 2:20 p.m. ET Friday, up about 39% year-to-date.\n\nThe tech giant has 23 \"buy\" ratings, 21 \"hold\" ratings, and five \"sell\" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $219.19, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nBrooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie is planning to release a digital token for others to invest in his contract\n\nGlobal central banks are in a rate-cutting frenzy.
