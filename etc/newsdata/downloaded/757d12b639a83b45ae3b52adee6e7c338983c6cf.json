France\u2019s players and coaches will not shout it from the Imperial Palace rooftops but they know an English win in the Pool C contest on Saturday will offer Les Bleus a slightly enhanced chance of success in the knockout stages.\n\nNot so much Le Crunch, then, and more L\u2019\u00c9nigme. Finish second in Pool C and France will potentially be in line to face the familiar threat of Wales in the quarter-finals and avoid the half of the draw occupied by New Zealand. Beat England and, conversely, they may well have to defeat the Wallabies and the All Blacks on consecutive weekends merely to reach the final.\n\nRugby World Cup pool permutations: who needs what in the last week? Read more\n\nIt all makes life slightly less straightforward than it would otherwise be for Eddie Jones\u2019s squad. If France opt to field an under-strength team, for example, might it not make some sense strategically to rest a couple of key men themselves?\n\nJones has already indicated he is contemplating a few changes and it is not hard to see why. Stick with the same starting XV having already qualified and he may have some cause for regret should injury subsequently strike and force him to pick a rusty replacement for a big knockout game. \u201cWe recognise we\u2019re not going to play the same 23 from start to finish,\u201d the scrum coach, Neal Hatley, said. \u201cIf someone hasn\u2019t played for five weeks, you can\u2019t just throw him in and say: \u2018Right, off you go.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmong the fringe candidates who might benefit from a run-out are Mako Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, with Ellis Genge, Joe Launchbury, Mark Wilson and Joe Cokanasiga other possible candidates off the bench. Jones clearly needs to find an alternative to Billy Vunipola, who twisted an ankle in the 39-10 win against Argentina on Saturday, but there is a wider juggling act to consider as well.\n\nIn a perfect world, for example, Jones would prefer to be seeing more from two of his key playmakers, Owen Farrell and Ben Youngs. With the greater good in mind, might it be worth easing George Ford, perhaps England\u2019s best player in their opening three games, on to the bench for this encounter, starting Farrell at 10 and pairing Slade and Manu Tuilagi in midfield? With Jonny May and Nowell on the wings, Anthony Watson at full-back and Cokanasiga on the bench, that would also keep Elliot Daly fresh for the bigger climbs ahead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Will Eddie Jones risk George Ford against France?

England\u2019s management were encouraged by the tireless Curry\u2019s efforts as a stand-in No 8 in the second half against Argentina and continue to appreciate the enthusiasm Lewis Ludlam brings to the party.\n\nEven more crucial, though, is that everyone keeps sight of this squad\u2019s primary aim in Japan. Just four more wins and they will be hoisting the Webb Ellis Cup; now is not the time for unnecessary distractions.\n\n\u201cYou get momentum from winning and we want to win all the games,\u201d said Hatley, making clear the squad would much prefer to qualify first rather than second. \u201cEngland are playing France, I can\u2019t imagine anyone not taking that full out, 100mph seriously. We want to top the pool. There\u2019s been no team who have ever won a World Cup having lost a pool game and that for us sets a precedent. France is a traditional enemy and we want to beat them.\u201d\n\nThe players have a similar mindset; at this stage of a World Cup no one wants to risk someone else coming in and taking their shirt. The Saracens hooker Jamie George said: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I speak on behalf of everyone that we are all desperate to play in this game. It\u2019s another opportunity to represent your country in a World Cup, which as we all know is very rare.\u201d\n\nMay, scorer of 19 tries in 30 Tests in the three years since he first played for England under Jones, is equally keen to be involved, having already scored three tries against France in the Six Nations this year. \u201cYou feel it building all week,\u201d the Leicester winger said. \u201cWe have done so much training that you feel ready to go off like a rocket at the weekend.\u201d From England\u2019s perspective, beating France is never a mixed blessing.", "description": "Whoever wins Pool C know they are likely to have to beat Australia and then the All Blacks to reach the World Cup final", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac0675e8a0a35a8e887a04a7473b3119a716487/49_51_3474_2085/master/3474.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=76dde79973c4694455bcf39b31358a76", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
