The humbleness. The meekness. These are the real heroes. I\u2019m just doing my part.\u201d\n\nVincent, the NFL\u2019s Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2002 for his off-field work, first captured the local YWCA\u2019s attention by speaking at a luncheon a year ago. He now is in charge of the league\u2019s football operations and is a former president of the NFL Players Association.\n\n___\n\nCHARACTER PLAYBOOK\n\nThe NFL\u2019s Character Playbook program will have reached almost a half-million students in just over three years of existence.\n\nPlayers across the league have been involved in the digital program that has drawn acclaim from educators everywhere. It is available to all U.S. schools free of charge for the first time.\n\nDesigned for students in the seventh through ninth grades, Character Playbook has seen nearly 500,000 middle school students access the curriculum for personal development. The course, developed and administered by digital education leader EVERFI, has also raised students\u2019 expectations about healthy relationship dynamics.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s headlines and usage of social media are making it more difficult to show, by example, how to live with empathy and compassion,\u201d says Suzanne McCormick, the U.S. president of United Way Worldwide. \u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason we should be deliberate about providing our kids the tools they need to build healthy relationships and make good decisions during their critical and formative middle school years.\u201d\n\nSchools that teach character education report higher academic performance, improved attendance, reduced violence, fewer disciplinary issues, a reduction in substance abuse and less vandalism.\n\nNow, the NFL and United Way are also incorporating digital mental health education into the program for five schools in each of the NFL\u2019s 32 markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to see the constant growth of the Character Playbook program and now be able to offer it free of charge to any school who wants it,\u201d says Alexia Gallagher, vice president of philanthropy and executive director of the NFL Foundation. \u201cVolunteerism is also an important aspect of character building and we\u2019re thrilled that Character Playbook\u2019s Character Challenge will encourage students to donate 100 minutes of their time - part of the Huddle for 100 to honor the league\u2019s 100th season.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSWEET HOME LOUISIANA\n\nDallas quarterback Dak Prescott is set for his first pro game in his home state of Louisiana when the Cowboys visit New Orleans on Sunday night.\n\nIt isn\u2019t super sentimental for the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year because he grew up a Cowboys fan near Shreveport, not far from the Texas-Louisiana line, and starred at Mississippi State. But the Superdome is the site of the state high school championship games, a goal Prescott didn\u2019t achieve at Haughton High.\n\nThe 26-year-old was an all-state quarterback as a senior, but Haughton lost in the quarterfinals.\n\n\u201cIt would in high school if I had made it there, it would have had special meaning,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cBut right now it\u2019s another game, going on the road, always fun, knowing this environment, knowing the Superdome, knowing how their fans are going to be, the intensity, the atmosphere. I\u2019m excited to go in there with my team.\u201d\n\nPrescott remembers attending a Saints game as a high school player of the week. He said he was buying about 10 tickets for family, but wasn\u2019t sure how many would attend Sunday. Prescott figures it\u2019s his high school dream delayed.\n\n\u201cI believe that I\u2019d be playing in this game, whether it was high school in the state championship or like I am today,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cSo yeah, I hope those kids back home use that and see that, see somebody that they can aspire after and try to go be better than, and one day being playing in the stadium for those guys, for us or any other NFL team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCARSON HONORED\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals will induct quarterback Carson Palmer into the club\u2019s Ring of Honor at halftime during Sunday\u2019s game against Seattle.\n\nPalmer is the 18th player to join the group, which includes quarterback Kurt Warner, cornerback Aeneas Williams and safety Pat Tillman.\n\nPalmer played for five seasons in Arizona and his .642 winning percentage (38-21-1) is the best for a starting quarterback in team history. He also owns the club\u2019s single-season records with 4,671 yards passing, 35 touchdowns and 104.6 passer rating, which all came in 2015. That\u2019s the year the Cardinals made it to the NFC championship game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s deserving,\u201d Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald said on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s a great human being and an unbelievable quarterback for many years.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NFL executive vice president and former Buffalo Bills safety Troy Vincent was honored by the Niagara Frontier YWCA for his extensive work advocating against domestic violence and sexual assault.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/nfl_notes_football_72083_c0-258-3491-2293_s1770x1032.jpg?27fa0893608196d13f1ab3639dbc1e6086470720", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
