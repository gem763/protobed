On Tuesday, Guyger\u2019s murder conviction was heralded as a rare victory in the national push for policing reform.\n\nBut on Wednesday, her sentence was almost immediately met with protest.\n\n[Amber Guyger, police officer who shot a man to death in his apartment, found guilty of murder]\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Jean family supporters called the punishment \u201ca slap in the face,\u201d as prosecutors had asked for a sentence no less than 28 years \u2014 the age Jean would be if he were still alive.\n\nInside the courtroom, a stunning scene was unfolding. Jean\u2019s younger brother \u2014 described by his family as suffering the most after the shooting \u2014 spoke directly to Guyger. He urged her to pray, he forgave her and he asked permission to give her a hug.\n\n\u201cI love you as a person and I don\u2019t wish anything bad on you,\u201d Brandt Jean told Guyger from the stand.\n\nThen, as their families watched, the ex-officer and the brother of the man she killed met in the front of the room and held each other in a long embrace. They were both in tears, and sobs could be heard in the courtroom.\n\n\n\nBotham Jean's younger brother Brandt Jean hugs former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger after delivering his impact statement following her 10-year prison sentence Wednesday for murder at the Frank Crowley Courts Building in Dallas.

She then approached Guyger and, in another emotional moment, handed her a Bible and embraced her, too.\n\nBotham Jean\u2019s brother\u2019s request to hug Amber Guyger and Judge Kemp\u2019s gift of her bible to Amber represent a spirit of forgiveness, faith and trust. In this same spirit, we want to move forward in a positive direction with the community. @ChiefHallDPD \u2014 Dallas Police Dept (@DallasPD) October 2, 2019\n\nIt was an unusual, striking conclusion to the high-profile case that reconstructed the night of Sept. 6, 2018.\n\nGuyger claimed she thought she was entering her own third-floor apartment that night. She said she mistook Jean for a burglar and shot him, fearing for her life. Prosecutors argued that Jean posed no threat \u2014 he was sitting on a couch in his fourth-floor unit eating ice cream before Guyger walked in, they said. Jurors agreed and rejected Guyger\u2019s self-defense argument.\n\nUnder Texas law, the 12-member jury that convicted Guyger was tasked with determining her punishment. Jurors rejected the \u201csudden passion\u201d defense, which would have lowered the sentencing range to two to 20 years. But they chose a punishment on the lower end of the five to 99 years allowed for murder.\n\nLegal experts said Guyger\u2019s lack of a criminal record and her career in public service may have played a role in the punishment.\n\n\u201cI would imagine with her being a police officer, even though they found her guilty, there would probably be some individuals on the jury who might be sympathetic to her,\u201d said Kenneth Williams, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston.\n\n\n\nAssistant District Attorney Jason Hermus waves a photo of Botham Jean at the jury as he presents his closing argument Monday in Amber Guyger's murder trial at the Frank Crowley Courts Building in Dallas. (Tom Fox/AP)\n\nFor a crime of this magnitude, Guyger\u2019s lawyers are likely pleased with the length of the sentence, said Brook Busbee, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.\n\nIn a post on Twitter, where \u201cOnly 10\u201d was among the most talked about phrases Wednesday night, Jean family lawyer Lee Merritt said the sentence was indicative of a broken system, one in which institutional racism is the rule and people of color are treated unjustly.\n\n\u201cOf course that\u2019s inadequate,\u201d Merritt wrote. \u201cThe entire justice system is inadequate and the work must continue.\u201d\n\nBefore breaking for deliberations, jurors heard from friends and family of both Guyger and Jean, who testified about the far-reaching consequences of their fatal encounter.\n\nProsecutors asked jurors to consider how the loss of Jean \u2014 a loving, encouraging man who spent his short life wanting to help others \u2014 reverberated through his family and his community.\n\n\u201cWe all were robbed of Botham and the greatness that he brought to Dallas County,\u201d one prosecutor said. \u201cBut honestly, who knows what his impact could truly have been had his life not been taken from him.\u201d\n\nThey contrasted Jean\u2019s character to Guyger\u2019s, pointing to text messages in which the fired officer mocked her black colleagues and joked about the death of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Those exchanges reveal what she \u201chad in her heart\u201d when others weren\u2019t looking, they argued.\n\nBut Guyger\u2019s attorneys said the texts were only a \u201csnapshot\u201d of her life and sought to portray her as a dedicated public servant who made a terrible mistake. Guyger\u2019s loved ones said she overcame a childhood sexual assault to get her job in law enforcement, a dream she\u2019d held since she was a little girl.\n\n\u201cFor her, that was all she ever wanted, all she ever dreamed of,\u201d said Dallas police Officer Cathy Odhiambo, one of Guyger\u2019s friends.\n\nKaren Guyger, the ex-officer\u2019s mother, said that when her daughter first called to tell her what happened, she was crying so hard it was difficult to understand.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to take his place,\u201d Karen Guyger said. \u201cShe always would tell me she wishes she could have taken his place.\u201d\n\nFriends and family of Jean told the jury about the pain of losing a warm and joyful man, a natural leader and supportive friend.\n\n\n\nBotham Jean\u2019s sister, Alissa Findley, talks about her brother during the sentencing hearing. (Tom Fox/Dallas Morning News/AP)\n\nHis best friend Alexis Stossel read through her last text-message exchange with Jean. She didn\u2019t see his response until the next morning. About the same time, she got a phone call and was told he had been killed.\n\n\u201cI slumped to the floor, and I just kept \u2014 I just kept screaming, \u2018Wait, wait, wait, wait!\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI hung up the phone, and then I called Botham seven times. And there was no answer.\u201d\n\nJean\u2019s father, Bertram Jean, took the stand after Stossel. He wept as he talked about his son. His friends sometimes told him he babied his boy, taking him to school every day and picking him up in the afternoons, but he always wanted him near.\n\nAfter Jean left St. Lucia, father and son remained close, communicating via WhatsApp and always discussing church sermons on Sundays, Bertram Jean said.\n\n\u201cHow could this have happened to our family?\u201d Bertram Jean asked. \u201cHow could we have lost Botham, such a good boy? He tried his best to live a good, honest life. He loved God; he loved everyone. How could this have happened to him?\u201d\n\n\n\nBertram Jean, father of victim Botham Jean, speaks to the media after evening services Wednesday devoted to the Jean family at Dallas West Church of Christ. (Brandon Wade/AP)\n\nLate Wednesday, roughly 200 demonstrators gathered on the courthouse steps and denounced Guyger\u2019s 10-year sentence. They called for broader police reform and connected Jean\u2019s death to a long history of police brutality toward black Americans.\n\n\u201cWe are here because we are sick and tired of another son lost to police brutality,\u201d said Dee Crane, the mother of Tavis Crane, who was killed by police in neighboring Arlington in 2017. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get justice here.\u201d\n\nCivil rights activist Omar Suleiman said he hopes the case leads to a broader discussion about policing and accountability.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue to seek reform of the police department,\u201d he said to shouts and applause. \u201cWe are not broken. We are not deterred.\u201d\n\nSuleiman\u2019s comments echoed those of Jean\u2019s mother, who spoke at a news conference after the jury returned the sentence. She said the trial should inspire reform and she criticized the way the police force handled evidence at the crime scene and advocated for an overhaul in the way it trains its officers \u2014 statements that apparently resonated with the city\u2019s police chief, who announced the department would open an internal affairs investigation into some of the issues raised during the trial.\n\n\u201cThere is much more to be done by the city of Dallas,\u201d Allison Jean said. \u201cThe corruption we saw during this process must stop. \u2026 Our life must move on, but our life must move on with change. There\u2019s got to be a better day.\u201d\n\nDeanna Paul contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nAmber Guyger, police officer who shot a man to death in his apartment, found guilty of murder\n\n\u2018Not racist but \u2026\u2019: White police officer who killed innocent black man in his home sent offensive texts\n\nAn officer shot an innocent black man in his own home.
