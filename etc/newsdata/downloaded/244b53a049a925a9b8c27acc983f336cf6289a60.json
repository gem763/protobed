It is currently owned by the Genting Group, a Malaysian conglomerate with business interests in real estate, hospitality, plantations and energy supply.\n\nThe firm bought the 91.5-metre yacht from the Malaysian government for $126m, which was about half its original purchase price, after it was seized by Indonesian authorities off the coast of Bali in 2018.\n\nPreviously named Equanimity, the yacht was owned by Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho, 37, better known as Jho Low. He has been accused of masterminding the looting hundreds of millions of dollars from Malaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB. Low is in hiding, believed by many to be in China. He has previously said that he has not broken any laws.\n\n1MDB: Malaysia files charges against 17 current and ex-Goldman Sachs bosses Read more\n\nFormer prime minister Najib Razak, 66, is currently on trial in Kuala Lumpur for 1MDB-related charges.\n\nTranquility typifies Low\u2019s super-luxury, celebrity-packed lifestyle. It features a gym, massage room, grand piano, swimming pool, sauna and \u201cbeach club\u201d section for socialising. Winch Design, an exclusive British firm, designed the interiors.\n\nBefore moving to make a sale profit on the vessel, Genting rented it to super-rich clients at a cost of $1.2m a week. US celebrity Kylie Jenner hired it for her birthday celebrations.\n\nBefore going into hiding, Low used his wealth to move in similar circles to the reality TV star. He became friends with Paris Hilton and mixed with Hollywood\u2019s film industry elite. In 2018, the producers of Martin Scorsese\u2019s hit film The Wolf of Wall Street paid back $60m to the US government after allegations the film was funded with money stolen from 1MDB.\n\nIn April this year, when Genting acquired the yacht, Low spoke through his publicist of his anger at its \u201cbargain-basement\u201d $126m sale price.", "description": "The Tranquility, seized by authorities and sold for a \u2018bargain\u2019 $126m in April, is back on market after stint as celebrity hangout", "authors": ["Jamie Fullerton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/651c31cf2bdac0de2f341d3596a90151f2065828/0_91_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0913ba995549134c612d35d14f4666c2", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
