However, there was no immediate confirmation of this from Italy.\n\nGerman NGO Sea-Eye, which operates the Alan Kurdi, earlier released a video they said showed shots being fired in the air by a man on a boat flying a Libyan flag as they were plucking migrants from a dinghy on Saturday.\n\nLeague leader Matteo Salvini, who was Italy's interior minister for 14 months up until August, had closed Italian ports to charity ships, leaving boats stranded in the Mediterranean for many days awaiting authorization to dock.\n\nSalvini denounced Tuesday's decision to let the Ocean Viking come to port. \"Once again the Italian government has dropped its trousers. Once again it is doing a favor to an NGO ... which encourages human traffickers to ply their trade,\" he said.\n\nThe League's decision to quit the coalition opened the door for the center-left Democratic Party (PD) to enter government. The PD has pushed for a more moderate immigration policy and has looked to Europe to help share the strain.\n\nHowever, efforts to set up an automatic EU-wide redistribution system for migrants reaching Italy appears to have floundered and MSF said it was \"sorry\" that only three countries had agreed to take in the new arrivals.\n\nSalvini says the new government's more welcoming approach to NGOs has led to an immediate spike in arrivals, with 2,498 boat migrants reaching Italy in September against 947 in the same month last year and 1,854 people coming ashore so far this month against 1,007 in all of October 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Susan Fenton)", "description": "Italy said on Tuesday it would let a French charity rescue ship disembark 104 migrants after the vessel spent 11 days at sea waiting for authorization to dock.
