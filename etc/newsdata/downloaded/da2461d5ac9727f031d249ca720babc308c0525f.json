I had a chance to take a look at all of them after the show and have a few quick takeaways.\n\niPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max\n\nApple is putting its focus on the things people care about: price, battery life and cameras. The iPhone 11's list price is $699, which is $50 cheaper than last year's equivalent, the XR. Apple also promises an hour more of battery life, making it the longest-lasting iPhone ever. The iPhone 11 Pro promises 4 hours longer battery life than the iPhone XS, while the iPhone 11 Pro has 5 hours more than the iPhone XS Max. You get wide angle, ultra wide angle and 2x optical zoom on the Pro models, provided by three different -- and all very visible -- cameras on the back.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max feature three very visible cameras on the back. Todd Haselton | CNBC\n\nThe iPhone 11 doesn't have the optical zoom. But the iPhone 11 can now take portraits of things besides just people since it has two lenses. I also like the front facing camera on all three which can automatically turn into wide angle for fitting more people into a selfie.\n\nThe iPhone 11. Todd Haselton | CNBC\n\nThey look nice. I particularly like the midnight-green color and the less glossy finish on the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max in midnight green. It's not that green. Todd Haselton | CNBC\n\nI wish there was reverse wireless charging to charge AirPods -- a feature that was rumored but was never mentioned. I like that Apple will include an 18W fast charger with the Pro models for faster charging. The cameras look promising in early tests, too.\n\n10.2-inch iPad\n\nThe new iPad starts at $329. Todd Haselton | CNBC\n\nThe new 10.2-inch iPad felt like an iPad Pro. I love the added keyboard support, something the 9.7-inch lacked without Apple's Smart Connector. And you can definitely see and feel the added screen size. Starting at $329, this seems like a no-brainer for most folks who \"just need a new iPad.\"\n\nApple Watch Series 5\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 Todd Haselton | CNBC", "description": "Here's a first look at all of the new products Apple announced on Tuesday at its big iPhone event.", "authors": ["Todd Haselton"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106122824-1568157720426todd-11pro-promax.jpg?v=1568157961", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
