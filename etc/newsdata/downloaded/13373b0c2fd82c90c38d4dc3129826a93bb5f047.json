Jackson returned to the sideline in the second half, seemingly in good spirits while wearing a walking boot and on crutches.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got you,\u201d offensive lineman Ellis McKennie said the players told Jackson. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTwo Rutgers defenders collided into Jackson as he released the ball on a pass play with 22 seconds remaining in the second quarter and Maryland leading 27-7 with the ball on its own 41-yard line. After the game, Coach Michael Locksley defended the decision to continue to push for points by passing at that point, noting how Maryland had timeouts and he wanted to \u201ccreate momentum and steal points because we knew we were getting the ball in the second half.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJackson completed 9 of 16 passes for 179 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nCollege football Week 6 winners and losers\n\nJackson, a graduate transfer from Virginia Tech, quickly established himself as Maryland\u2019s most reliable option at the position before struggling in consecutive losses to Temple and Penn State. But led by backup quarterback Tyrrell Pigrome, Maryland\u2019s offense never slowed following Jackson\u2019s injury. Pigrome was perhaps more prepared to play after taking about half the first-team reps in practice this week because of Jackson\u2019s recent inconsistency.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGoing into the game, our thinking was if Josh were to struggle, that we would have to make a change there to get us going, because this was a game we needed to win,\u201d Locksley said, adding that he was pleased with Jackson\u2019s first-half performance and decision-making.\n\nAnything less than an emphatic win would have intensified concerns, especially given the missing pieces on Rutgers\u2019 squad. The Scarlet Knights fired coach Chris Ash, along with offensive coordinator John McNulty, six days ago, leaving former tight ends Nunzio Campanile in charge. Both Rutgers quarterback Art Sitkowski and running back Raheem Blackshear, the team\u2019s best offensive player, did not play while reportedly holding onto their ability to redshirt this season.\n\nAD\n\nAfter last week\u2019s blowout loss against Penn State showed how far Maryland still stands from the conference\u2019s top tier, Saturday helped prove these Terps aren\u2019t in danger against the conference\u2019s worst team either. The Terps (3-2, 1-1 Big Ten) rattled off explosive plays throughout the game, starting with Dontay Demus Jr.\u2019s 80-yard touchdown catch on Maryland\u2019s first offensive snap. The team\u2019s top three running backs \u2014 Anthony McFarland, Javon Leake and Tayon Fleet-Davis \u2014 all had standout performances, combining for the six other touchdowns and showing off their ability in flashy bursts.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a byproduct of the skill we have,\u201d Locksley said of the running backs\u2019 ability to create plays of massive gains.\n\nLeake scored three times, including on a 100-yard kickoff return that began the second half and a 46-yard rushing touchdown late in the second quarter. During halftime, the team knew it had a chance to grab firm hold of the advantage and the players talked about Leake scoring on that opening kickoff.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHouse call! House call!\u201d Leake said, recounting the halftime message from his teammates. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this, Javon! Let\u2019s get it!\u201d\n\nFleet-Davis exploded for consecutive massive gains, a 50-yard catch followed by a 23-yard receiving score, during a second-quarter drive when Jackson was still in at quarterback. McFarland, who Locksley said still isn\u2019t 100 percent back from a minor ankle injury, impressed as Maryland\u2019s leading rusher with 87 yards on eight carries, a total primarily fueled by his 80-yard score in the third quarter.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier in the game, McFarland scored on a two-yard run after one play after Ayinde Eley\u2019s interception and 39-yard return. Eley said his teammates will jokingly give him a hard time for not reaching the end zone, but \u201cif I get another opportunity, I\u2019ll be sure to get in there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe offense worked behind a makeshift offensive line, playing with two first-choice players through much of the game. Three redshirt freshman \u2014 left tackle Jaelyn Duncan, right guard Austin Fontaine and right tackle Spencer Anderson \u2014 started and played for much of the game.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give those guys enough credit for how they stepped in and played today,\u201d said McKennie, who joined Sean Christie as the two veteran linemen in the game Saturday. \u201cWe had three 18-, 19-year-olds playing in a Big Ten football game today and got a win.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt took some time for the offensive line to perform at its best, particularly the group had to adjust blocking schemes since Rutgers\u2019 defensive front played differently than what it had shown on tape. But ultimately, the unit paved the way for 218 rushing yards.\n\nPigrome played well when he took on relief duties, throwing for 111 yards and completing 13 of 18 passes. He said is more comfortable now than at the end of last season when he stepped after starter Kasim Hill tore his ACL. Pigrome has shed the knee brace he wore since tearing his ACL in 2017 and said, \u201cI feel back to myself.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMaryland\u2019s defense effectively contained Rutgers (1-4, 0-3), particularly in the second half. The Scarlet Knights\u2019 lone score tied the game at 7 early in the second quarter, just after a well-executed double-reverse flea flicker when Langan found Bo Melton for a 49-yard gain despite pass interference. That play set up Langan\u2019s three-yard scoring run.\n\nAD\n\nLocksley called the game a \u201cbounce-back win\u201d for his group, which gave up 59 points against Penn State last weekend and had struggled offensively in the previous two games.\n\n\u201cI wanted to see how our team would respond,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe had two tough weeks where we didn\u2019t get it done. Our guys worked really hard to not reap the benefits of their hard work on Saturday.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nCollege football TV viewing guide for Week 6\n\nWhen Navy takes on Air Force, Malcolm Perry will try to keep hits from coming\n\nThe Kyle Trask Story: Six years as a backup QB, then a Hollywood debut for Florida\n\nAt Tennessee, how bad can it get?
