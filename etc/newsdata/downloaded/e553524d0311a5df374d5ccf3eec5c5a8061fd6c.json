Consequently, the commission has asked for a review of the open-ended policy.\n\nThe open-ended procurement policy is an integral part of the agricultural price support policy for the two most important cereals: rice and wheat. A review of it will constitute an examination of its basic structure.\n\nThere are persuasive economic factors to undertake a review. However, in all probability the review will not happen in the near future because there is a powerful political case to let status quo prevail.\n\nTo illustrate, the CACP report has data on the expansion of procurement operations in the recent past.\n\nAt the national level, the number of farmers who benefit from procurement increase 2.05 million in rabi marketing season of 2016-17 to 3.98 million in 2018-19.\n\nIt\u2019s an impressive expansion of procurement operations when seen from the angle of providing a larger number of farmers a stable price regime for their production.\n\nThe political angle comes in when one looks at the geographies where the expansion has taken place. The big expansion has been in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe increase in UP was noteworthy. In a space of two years, the procurement coverage increased from 1.7 lakh farmers to a little over one million. The CACP report said that in states such as UP the coverage is still rather low and should be increased. That works well at a political level for the BJP, which is in power in the state and the anchor of the central government.\n\nGiven this situation, why will the government be in a hurry to review the basic structure of the current price support policy in agriculture?", "description": "The Commission for Agricultural Cost and Prices (CACP)\u00a0 in its report on the minimum support price (MSP) for rabi crops has called into question an essential element of the price support policy.
