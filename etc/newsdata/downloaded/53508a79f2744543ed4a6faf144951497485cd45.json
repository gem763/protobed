This afternoon, Boris Johnson confirmed his warning he will withdraw his deal tonight if MPs vote down plans to debate the bill within a three-day timetable. Christopher Hope and Tony Diver outline what is happening with Brexit today, and show just how tight it will be to get the deal over the line before Hallowe'en. You can follow all the action as it happens tonight on The Telegraph's liveblog. The key argument against approving the Prime Minister's three-day timetable for the deal is there is so much to debate in the 110-page Withdrawal Agreement Bill, published late last night. Deputy Political Editor Anna Mikhailova details the key discussion points. And here is what today's events have done to the value of the pound.\n\nOver in Europe, Jean-Claude Juncker said Brexit has been a waste of time and energy during a European Parliament debate today, where Donald Tusk warned a no-deal Brexit would always be Britain's fault. In one of his final speeches in Strasbourg, the president of the European Commission said the EU had done everything it could to avoid no-deal and to make contingency plans. In Northern Ireland, a unionist campaigner has launched legal proceedings against the Prime Minister claiming his Brexit deal breaches the Good Friday Agreement.", "description": "If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here and try our Audio Briefings on WhatsApp.", "authors": ["Chris Price", "Asa Bennett", "Tom Harris", "Eilis O'Hanlon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213769629-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqzPDZVAnxkOCx_pj0EK6q2jh_Z6MTqoXOv3q9EuCAFbs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
