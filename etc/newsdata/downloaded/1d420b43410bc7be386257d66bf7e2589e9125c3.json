They are also people who just love that she\u2019s a young woman of color who always talks about \u201cwhat we in Hawaii call that spirit of Aloha,\u201d as she\u2019d said at the Wing Ding. \u201cAloha means so much more than \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018goodbye,\u2019 as some of you may be familiar. What it really means is love and respect and a recognition that we are all connected, that we are all children of God, we are all brothers and sisters, regardless of the color of our skin, or where we come from, or who we love, or how we worship or if we worship.\u201d At a recent event in Los Angeles, a woman told Gabbard she had cancer, and attributed it to a wire on her roof. \u201cI\u2019m now electrosensitive,\u201d the woman said. She told Gabbard that she lived in her car and wanted to know what the candidate would do about Federal Communications Commission standards. \u201cThis is something I\u2019m looking more into as I\u2019m hearing from people like you who are raising these concerns,\u201d Gabbard replied. A 16-year-old at the event told Gabbard he is frustrated that no one seems to care about the concerns of young people. \u201cI\u2019m smiling,\u201d she told him, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve lost track of how many times I\u2019ve been told that.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s a presidential candidate and a member of Congress, but tracking down Gabbard wasn\u2019t easy. In July, when she was in Milwaukee to speak at a veterans\u2019 breakfast during a League of United Latin American Citizens conference\u2014where I\u2019d heard she\u2019d been well received, talking about her own service\u2014I ran into her while she was waiting in line for a vegan sandwich at the Milwaukee Public Market. She was serious about this race, she told me, and she wouldn\u2019t be in it if she thought anyone else running could be commander in chief. I said we should do an interview, and she told me to get in touch with her new press secretary, but she couldn\u2019t remember his last name, and neither could any of the staffers standing nearby whom she asked.\n\nContrast that with how her sister and a small circle of aides wear earpieces and cluster around her like a security detail. Gabbard\u2019s husband, Abraham Williams, a trained videographer, uses a special camera stabilizer that gives a cinematic feel to the live-streams of her events. Her website features coding that isn\u2019t quite sophisticated, but is slightly more than meets the eye: In the final days of trying to qualify for the September debate, it would generate random numbers just short of 130,000\u2014the donor number she needed to hit\u2014every time the page was refreshed, and then for weeks after had a one-minute countdown urging: \u201cIf you contribute in the next minute, we can hit our weekly goal.\u201d The countdown reset with every refresh. (These tactics aren\u2019t typical for candidates\u2019 websites.) Her campaign now claims to have well over 130,000 donors. A spokesman wouldn\u2019t say how many people are currently on staff, though her second-quarter Federal Elections Commission report showed salaries going to just six employees, for a total of $50,000 over three months, in addition to a few consulting fees.", "description": "The 38-year-old presidential contender does not fit any \u201cconventional\u201d political profile.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTX72UPA/facebook.jpg?1567651075", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
