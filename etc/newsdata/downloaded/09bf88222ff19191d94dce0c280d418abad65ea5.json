Just as she did with The Racist Sandwich Podcast (currently on hiatus) Soleil brings much needed thoughtfulness to the world of restaurant critique, whether that means eliminating the clunky star system, reexamining the role of luxury in modern dining, or taking on the almighty restaurant listicle. Having thoughts and feelings about food may be her job, but it\u2019s not exactly something she switches off at the end of the work day, which is great news, because she was nice enough to share some of those thoughts and feelings with me.\n\nCurrent gig: Restaurant critic for the San Francisco Chronicle\n\nWhat do you usually eat for breakfast?\n\nFor breakfast I usually eat nothing. Or, if I\u2019m feeling extra sassy\u2014I\u2019m still on the quest to find the perfect breakfast sandwich in San Francisco. So maybe once a week I\u2019ll try a new place for a breakfast sandwich. So far it\u2019s been The Sentinel and Super Duper Burger and a place called Lou\u2019s Sandwiches that\u2019s actually pretty damn good. Usually it\u2019s just nothing because I always have a really big lunch or dinner so I don\u2019t really feel the need to eat breakfast.\n\nWhen you say \u201cthe perfect breakfast sandwich\u201d what are you looking for?\n\nA round bun, first of all\u2014the closer it is to a kaiser roll the better\u2014eggs that haven\u2019t been microwaved, and good textural contrast. That might mean crispy bacon or, if I\u2019m very lucky, that means a hash brown like the kind they sell in the freezer\u2014those oval things. If that\u2019s in the sandwich? Game over.\n\nLike a McDonald\u2019s kind of style hash brown?\n\nYes.\n\nDo you like an Egg McMuffin at all?\n\nNo, not really. It\u2019s kind of the same texture all throughout and I just don\u2019t care for that.\n\nIf you don\u2019t eat breakfast, do you drink coffee or tea?\n\nYeah. I\u2019m supposed to not drink coffee but I do anyway. I\u2019m drinking coffee right now. My psychiatrist says that it is bad for people with anxiety to put more caffeine in their bodies. But you know, I\u2019m paying her.\n\nAnd it\u2019s coffee! You\u2019re not doing cocaine or anything.\n\nRight. But I guess like I\u2019m already at \u201ccoffee levels\u201d of anxiety. So if I drink coffee then it\u2019s basically like I just did cocaine.\n\nOh. How do you usually fix your coffee?\n\nBlack\u2014that\u2019s probably also part of the problem\u2014usually hot. If I\u2019m feeling very fancy I will drink yerba mate, which I have at home. People don\u2019t usually have yerba mate at cafes which is really sad.\n\nThat is too bad. Do you get to cook at home a lot for yourself?\n\nNo. No, I don\u2019t. If I want to cook breakfast at home, maybe I\u2019ll do it there, but often I\u2019ll cook like once a week, and usually a big thing of just random shit like curry. Or I\u2019ll make a fried rice out of all the leftovers that I\u2019ve accrued from the restaurants that I\u2019ve eaten at. Because you know fried rice is the great equaliser.\n\nCompletely. Do you have a \u201cusual day\u201d food-wise, or is it just all over the place?\n\nIt\u2019s usually all over the place, although there is a sense of routine despite that. I\u2019ll probably go to one pop-up a week, and one tasting menu a week, and the rest is kind of a grab bag of random stuff that\u2019s happening in the Bay Area that I\u2019m supposed to check out. The amount of cuisines that I eat, and actually the amount of food that I eat is so variable from day to day, but there\u2019s still these broad strokes of things that I try to do.\n\nWhat do you usually do for lunch if you\u2019re not at a restaurant?\n\nI will probably go to a food truck.\n\nDo you have any favourites?\n\nNo I don\u2019t. I\u2019m always trying stuff that\u2019s new. I\u2019ve never actually brought lunch from home. I\u2019ve never been in that habit because I\u2019ve always worked in restaurants. Why would you do that? And I\u2019ve never worked in an office. And so that habit has never been inscribed on me.\n\nAre you in an office now?\n\nYes.\n\nAre there office snacks or anything?\n\nThere are kind of office snacks\u2014PR people will send me random shit all the time. Like a lotus seed puffs or\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014pepper jelly or just random things, and maybe you can cobble together some snacks out of that.\n\nDo you work with other food writers or is it pretty much just you?\n\nI\u2019m the one who does restaurant reviews but we have reporters, and the wine critic sits across from me, and there\u2019s other folks with beats within food. So we\u2019re pretty robust for a newspaper food section.\n\nWhat\u2019s the what\u2019s the craziest thing you\u2019ve ever been sent by a PR person?\n\nA framed Photoshopped image based on the first cover that we did for the reviews that I wrote. It was like a side profile of my head. It was illustrated and then had thought bubbles with the themes that were in the reviews. But the PR company Photoshopped their brand into the thought bubbles. And it was sent in this extremely gaudy, gilded frame and I was just like \u201cnow I gotta deal with this.\u201d But it was big. It was maybe like 20 by 76cm. So actually the weirdest thing wasn\u2019t food, it was that. It felt like such a weirdly intimate kind of serial killer-ish thing to send.\n\nDo you ever pack any snacks in your bag?\n\nI don\u2019t snack because it just seems like an unnecessary amount of food to be eating when my life is to eat. I chew gum a lot if I\u2019m feeling a little bit hungry, just because the odds are I\u2019m going to be eating something ridiculous that day. Eating has taken on a very interesting curve since getting this job.\n\nDo you ever crave something simple and home-cooked like steamed vegetables?\n\nYeah, I mean that\u2019s generally what I do at home anyway. But there are also ways you can order that, especially in California. You can get a steamed vegetable at a restaurant because everyone is you know...fucking hippies. There\u2019s a simplicity to California cuisine that I appreciate, because when I\u2019m feeling a little burnt out I\u2019ll just order asparagus, and that\u2019s something you can do here.\n\nYou lived in Portland for a while. How would you compare the Portland food scene with the Bay Area food scene?\n\nThe Bay Area food scene is a lot more about fine dining. I find that there\u2019s a lot more stratification, whereas Portland has a pretty robust middle ground. As far as restaurants go you can get pretty great food\u2014you won\u2019t have to break the bank. Whereas here the choice becomes a bit more stark; it\u2019s either fine dining, or something that\u2019s maybe 60 dollars a person, or quick service.\n\nIf you do get the chance to cook at home what do you usually make for dinner?\n\nUsually I would make Asian food of some kind, generally Chinese or Japanese. I think that\u2019s just because of the neighbourhood I live in\u2014which has a bunch of Chinese groceries\u2014and that\u2019s also just what\u2019s in my pantry. So I\u2019ll make dashi and rice and vegetables or a stir fry or noodles or curry\u2014like Japanese curry. That\u2019s just easiest thing to whip together. And it\u2019s hard because I don\u2019t have a lot of fresh vegetables\u2014and so curries are the best for frozen vegetables\u2014just because they\u2019re going to go bad because I don\u2019t eat them right away.\n\nWhat condiments usually keep stocked in your fridge or pantry?\n\nGood question. So I have chilli oil generally\u2014the standby is Lao Gan Ma. And then I have the Fly By Jing chilli oil which is a super fancy version of that. It\u2019s really delicious and toasty. And then sriracha, of course. I\u2019m trying to think of what else we have in there. A ton of pickles. We live by a Polish deli and so we have endless jars of pickled cucumbers, beets, cabbage, everything.\n\nCould you estimate how many different types of pickles you have?\n\nProbably five. Six if you count kimchi as like an extra fermented vegetable thing.\n\nFor hot sauces is it pretty much sriracha?\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much sriracha. I do have one fairly old bottle of Secret Aardvark in the fridge too. Every time I pass through PDX I grab one.\n\nHow is the pizza in the Bay Area?\n\nNeapolitan and woodfired pizza is the easiest to find. But there\u2019s some really interesting other pizzas here. There are some places that do sourdough pizza, which makes sense. And then there are a couple of spots that have cropped up\u2014a few Detroit-style\u2014like the pan pizza. There\u2019s a good variety.\n\nIs there any New York style pizza?\n\nThere\u2019s a little bit, yes. but I don\u2019t need that.\n\nIt\u2019s not your favourite?\n\nIt is and that\u2019s why. You know what I mean? I\u2019m not going to pretend that it\u2019s the same. It\u2019s not. And that\u2019s fine.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t ever do a Taco Bell run or anything like that?\n\nNo. Although the last time I was at Taco Bell was pretty recently just because I wanted to see the Pacifica Taco Bell which is legendary.\n\nI was never really into fast food, honestly. If I wanted something like that I would just eat rice and an egg with Maggi and chilli, and that\u2019s like my fast food.\n\nHow was that?\n\nIt was beautiful. I think it\u2019s a really picturesque location. But I realised that I hadn\u2019t been to Taco Bell in a long-arse time so I was like \u201cthey have screens?\u201d and \u201cthey have chicken?\u201d I was just thrown. I think the last time I had Taco Bell was in high school.\n\nOh wow. There has been so much innovation.\n\nYeah! I had a Doritos Locos Taco and I was like \u201cAh. OK. I see now.\u201d But I was never really into fast food, honestly. If I wanted something like that I would just eat rice and an egg with Maggi and chilli, and that\u2019s like my fast food.\n\nDo you enjoy a good burger?\n\nI do sometimes when I\u2019m on my period, for sure.\n\nFor the iron?\n\nYeah. I\u2019m anemic and so I get these monster cravings for meat when I\u2019m on my period. And burgers have all kinds of shit in them so it feels really good to eat.\n\nAre you a thin patty person or a thicker burger person?\n\nI love a good smash burger. Like I said before with breakfast sandwiches, I love texture, especially within a sandwich. I like crunchy things between bread.\n\nI would buy a bagel which came with margarine and a bag of Doritos and I would just sandwich the Doritos between the slices of bagel and eat that as a sandwich.\n\nWhat are your favourite ways to add texture to a sandwich you\u2019re making at home?\n\nSo my favourite potato chip is the Sweet Maui Onion chip\u2014you know the Hawaiian ones? I\u2019ll throw those into a sandwich. Of course pickles add a really delicious sort of texture. I hate putting lettuces in sandwiches because of how limited their abilities are as far as adding anything of substance. Actually when I was a kid\u2014I can trace this to that\u2014I was in middle school and I remember taking my lunch money and, rather than buying a hot lunch or anything of substance, I would buy a bagel, which came with margarine and a bag of Doritos and I would just sandwich the Doritos between the slices of bagel and eat that as a sandwich. That was just amazing to me.\n\nThat was very much my vibe in middle school system.\n\nYeah I think about it sometimes. I wouldn\u2019t do it again because I don\u2019t know how far I\u2019ll fall from that point.\n\nI like that it\u2019s a bagel too. It\u2019s just so bready.\n\nI know. I know. And the margarine? Disgusting.\n\nI absolutely love it. Speaking of cheap food hacks\u2014do you have any instant ramen hacks?\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is a hack. I don\u2019t think that this fits the Lifehacker brand. I think y\u2019all have higher standards than I do for what constitutes a \u201chack.\u201d But in my family we love mie goreng\u2014the noodles from Indonesia. It\u2019s so delicious. Oh my god. So good. We just cook them with all kinds of shit in them. They\u2019re supposed to be stir fried noodles, and so we add cooked shrimp and a sunny side up egg and then chilli oil, and extra fried shallots as well to make it super savoury.\n\nDo you have a favourite movie theatre snack?\n\nPopcorn truly is the rice of the West\n\nActually yes. So one of my favourite things to do is\u2014you know at Costco how they have sriracha salt or sriracha seasoning? I like to bring that in and put it on the popcorn, and it\u2019s so spicy that you should not touch your eyes after eating it, but it\u2019s so good. I used to work for a movie theatre\u2014well, as a volunteer\u2014and my thing was I would bring spices and herbs to work and convince people to try them on their popcorn. And they were super sceptical the whole time because they were like \u201cwhat the fuck?\u201d And we didn\u2019t have powdered ranch or cheddar because we were just, you know, really stuck-up people. So I brought in Ethiopian spice mix, and nutritional yeast, and za\u2019atar, and things like that.\n\nPopcorn is such a great just blank canvas for experimenting.\n\nPopcorn truly is the rice of the West.\n\nDo you cook it at home?\n\nNo, we don\u2019t have a microwave. So if I have it at home, it\u2019s by the bag.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s has a pickle popcorn now. Do you go to Trader Joe\u2019s at all?\n\nI was actually there last night because it\u2019s by our gym. We don\u2019t usually buy premade stuff. We should, but I always get the feeling\u2014especially at Trader Joe\u2019s\u2014which is ridiculous, where I look at something and I think \u201coh I could just make that,\u201d but of course I never would, because I don\u2019t have time anymore. But that\u2019s also why I don\u2019t buy bread or basic things, because I\u2019m like \u201coh, I\u2019ll just make that.\u201d And a lot of Trader Joe\u2019s prepared stuff, like the frozen whatever nonsense, seems really achievable for someone with a basic knowledge of cooking.\n\nDo you like any of their condiments or any of their weird specific-to-Trader Joe\u2019s products?\n\nI haven\u2019t delved too deeply into it because the kind of condiments and accoutrements that I prefer are easily found in the Korean, Chinese, and Polish grocery stores near my place.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s condiments are kind of terrible actually. They have a wasabi mayo, and I was like \u201coh that\u2019s good,\u201d but then I was like \u201cor I could just add wasabi powder to regular mayo?\u201d\n\nYeah. That\u2019s a lot of wasabi mayo.\n\nIs there anything that you just refuse to make or don\u2019t like cooking?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. There is definitely stuff I don\u2019t feel like making because I think my husband could just do it himself, like lentils. Actually the more basic something is the more\u2014and this is me being very cynical about myself\u2014the more beneath me it feels to make the thing.\n\nIf I\u2019m going to do something I\u2019m going to do it the fuck up.\n\nNo, I love that and I completely support it. Why would you spend your time making lentils? It\u2019s so boring.\n\nYeah, right. If I\u2019m going to do something I\u2019m going to do it the fuck up.\n\nCompletely. So you like baking as well as cooking?\n\nYeah. I do. I really like making biscuits in particular.\n\nWhat kind of biscuits do you make\u2014a drop biscuit or a cut biscuit?\n\nA cut biscuit. I use my own recipe. I used to be a big fan of the Ratio App\u2014Michael Ruhlman\u2019s\u2014and so I have a ratio that I saved on that, that I just kept using for years. Because, you know, if I want to make a dozen biscuits, or if I make six, or make 30, I can do that.\n\nDo you use a lot of other people\u2019s recipes?\n\nYes and no. Like anyone like me, I have a pretty large collection of cookbooks, and so I\u2019ll dig in there for ideas and improvise from there. I\u2019m not really a recipe user in general.\n\nGoing back to the grocery stores in your neighbourhood. You said there is a Chinese a Polish and a Korean one?\n\nThere are definitely multiples of each of those, because I live in a neighbourhood called the Richmond in San Francisco, and that\u2019s kind of where a lot of the immigrants from Eastern Europe, Russia, East Asia ended up.\n\nDo have a favourite item to get from each that you can\u2019t get anywhere else?\n\nYeah. So for the Korean, definitely mandu\u2014the frozen dumplings\u2014and kimchi, of course. And the one in my neighbourhood has all kinds of kimchi, not just Napa cabbage kimchi, but chive kimchi and daikon kimchi and whatever other sort of banchan that they rotate out of a low-boy cooler. And then the Chinese places, usually the big thing for me is the chilli oil because that goes with everything. And of course the the canned fish I\u2019m a big fan of as well, because you just stir it on rice, you know? And it\u2019s perfect. Like mackrel, or like fried dace is really good too.\n\nAnd what about the Polish store? Do you have any regular items you purchase from there?\n\nOh yeah, pickles. Pickles and juice. I also have a bunch of Hunter\u2019s sausage in my freezer.\n\nWhat kind of sausage?\n\nHunter\u2019s sausage. There\u2019s a bunch of animals in there and they smoke it and it\u2019s just really damn good.\n\nDo you know which animals or is it a surprise each time?\n\nYou know, I don\u2019t remember. Whatever they are they\u2019re really good with eggs.\n\nThe details of which animals they aren\u2019t important! Can we see inside your fridge?\n\nYes.\n\nPhoto: Soleil Ho\n\nPhoto: Soleil Ho\n\nIn addition bread and biscuits, do you like to bake any sweets?\n\nNo, not really. My husband doesn\u2019t really love desserts and I don\u2019t either. If I want something sweet I\u2019ll just eat a fruit.\n\nWell that\u2019s good.\n\n[Laughs] Yeah. I guess I\u2019m really Southeast Asian in that way. Usually what we would do for dessert growing up was just eat an orange.\n\nAre you more of a cocktail person, a beer person, or a wine person?\n\nI\u2019m more of a cocktail person, although I\u2019m getting into wine a lot more, though \u201cinto it\u201d is kind of stretching it. I just understand that there are differences between the wines. [Laughs] I\u2019m working on it. But usually, and this is probably from my line cook days\u2014I was just really into beer. High ABV-type stuff. IPAs. And maybe that\u2019s from the Portland days too, where I really enjoyed hoppy stuff that would cut through a lot of the kinds of food that I was eating. That just works really well for my palate.\n\nDo you have a favourite spirit?\n\nI don\u2019t have a favourite, actually. I try a lot of different things, and when I was living in Mexico I got really into mezcal and raicilla, which you can\u2019t really get out here.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like a moonshine-ish variation on an agave liquor. It\u2019s really good. But a lot of the ones I had weren\u2019t name brand or anything. They were just made by local people, and it was good as hell. It\u2019s just from a label-less bottles from this guy down the road and you\u2019re just like \u201cfuck yeah.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s an agave spirit that\u2019s not aged?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s definitely rougher.\n\nDo you like a martini?\n\nNo. I actually don\u2019t. I keep trying them and recalibrating, and I\u2019m like \u201cnah, still hate it.\u201d\n\nIs there a food that gives you trouble as a food critic because you just don\u2019t like it?\n\nI\u2019m really ashamed that I can\u2019t get into durian. It\u2019s also one of those things where I just try it once a year to make sure. I really don\u2019t like it, but you know it\u2019s my legacy as a Vietnamese person, but I just can\u2019t.\n\nI haven\u2019t tried it yet because I don\u2019t want to prepare it myself.\n\nWell, you can try the ice cream and it comes in popsicle form too. But it\u2019s still. No. I can\u2019t.\n\nAre there any other frozen convenience foods that you stock up on besides the dumplings and sausage?\n\nOh, yeah. Frozen spinach is a really big part of my diet. Because you can just stir it into anything. And frozen peas. And then I usually just throw sliced bread into the freezer because I don\u2019t eat it that much.\n\nAre there any other canned foods besides canned fish you keep around?\n\nCanned tomato, just to have, is always nice. What\u2019s funny is I just put together my earthquake bag, and all my canned fish went into that, so I need to re-up. Because, you know, that\u2019s good for a couple days.\n\nWhat other food is in your earthquake bag?\n\nI actually was doing a story about camping food, and this one company sent me samples, so I have steel cut oats in there\u2014that you just add water to\u2014and \u201cbibimbap\u201d that\u2019s just in a bag. I think it\u2019s freeze dried so you just add hot water and then it becomes that thing. Maybe. We\u2019ll see.\n\nYou haven\u2019t tried it yet?\n\nNo. I did try their clam chowder\u2014actually it was corn chowder. It was fine. It was very...high in nutrients. It was really intense.\n\nI\u2019m glad that it was corn chowder and not clam chowder.\n\nYeah. That would be difficult.\n\nIf you could only choose one source of salt, one source of fat, and one source of acid when cooking, what would you choose for each category?\n\nOK! Salt would be fish sauce. Fat? Probably olive oil. And acid? That\u2019s a hard one but I think...pickled or fermented greens. I find that kimchi juice, for instance, is just a really delicious flavour booster. Historically when I\u2019ve made Bloody Marys, I would throw a bunch of kimchi juice in them too.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about non-alcoholic drinks. Do you do you drink a lot of water? Are you a soda person? Do you drink juice?\n\nI drink mostly water. I maybe have one soda every couple months. Usually if I am having especially porky dim sum or Korean barbecue, then I\u2019m like \u201cOh, a Coke would be great with this.\u201d I\u2019m pretty occasional on the soda front. I don\u2019t need a lot, but actually the thing that we always have at home is kombucha. My husband\u2019s obsessed.\n\nDo you make your own?\n\nI used to but he was drinking it too fast. And so I was like \u201cfuck this.\u201d It\u2019s not worth it. Because it would take me like a week or so to actually get the bottles and he\u2019d just suck \u2018em down.\n\nThat\u2019s frustrating.\n\nYeah. The man who loves kombucha too much.\n\nThat\u2019s one thing about having a male partner around. You\u2019ll put a lot of effort into something, or it will take you a while to perfect something and then they\u2019ll just inhale it. It\u2019s funny that he does it with kombucha.\n\nYeah, he\u2019s a special boy.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.", "description": "Most restaurant criticism is written for the rich, and for people who read reviews to validate their dining choices and impeccable taste, but Soleil Ho\u2019s reviews are not for them.
