So when I\u2019m not working, I try to let it run free and not do too much to it. This steamer helps maintains my curl pattern, and it also works for my skin. I try to use twice a week. I sit under there with the conditioner in \u2014 sometimes even with a little mask \u2014 and when I come out, my hair is so conditioned and moisturized. I think that\u2019s so important, especially for curly hair. And I try to make sure I\u2019m putting oils in. I didn\u2019t realize, until like a year ago, that when you use oils in your hair, it has to be mixed with something in order for it to really penetrate. I always mix castor oil with my conditioner. And you can get castor oil anywhere!
