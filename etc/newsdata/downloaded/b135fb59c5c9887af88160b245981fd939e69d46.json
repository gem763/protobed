Israel has refrained from significant strikes in Lebanon; Hezbollah has decreased its harassment on the Israel-Lebanon border and not initiated rocket barrages against Israel.\n\nAny renewed conflict carries risks for both.\n\nEven with Israel\u2019s anti-missile Iron Dome negating the economic damage of a confrontation, a large-scale ground campaign would exact a price in blood. In 2014, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Benjamin (Bibi) NetanyahuMORE\u2019s fear of public backlash against high casualties influenced tactical and operational choices in Gaza. Today, similar anxieties are certain to apply.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHezbollah, on the other hand, has emerged victorious but bloodied from eight years of civil war in Syria. It recruited fighters in southern Syria, constructed new missile factories and received fresh supplies, but an immediate war still would be costly. Moreover, Israel\u2019s Iron Dome modifies the strategic balance.\n\nNevertheless, war will come \u2014 if not now, then soon. Hezbollah\u2019s bloody pact with Iran demands it. Indeed, one must look east to find the real source of tension on Israel\u2019s northern border.\n\nThe Iranian regime blends Persian imperial haughtiness with Shia supremacism. Like Cyrus the Great, the first Persian emperor who held the title of \u201cKing of the Four Corners of the Earth,\u201d Tehran\u2019s theocrats intend to seize leadership of today\u2019s Islamic world.\n\nBut Iran\u2019s quest for Near Eastern and Islamic primacy requires accomplishing multiple objectives. It must defeat the Saudi-aligned Gulf monarchies, undermine the Hashemites in Jordan, and confront or co-opt a similarly neo-imperial Turkey, all while avoiding a fall from Russia\u2019s good graces.\n\nAmerica and Israel, the \u201cGreat\u201d and \u201cLittle\u201d Satans, are Iran\u2019s greatest adversaries. Understanding the threat each poses requires examining Iran\u2019s gains over three decades.\n\nIran spent the 1990s expanding its nuclear infrastructure. It turned post-2003 Iraqi factionalism to its advantage, sponsoring Shia militias that killed American soldiers; when the Iraqi army dissolved during ISIS\u2019s June 2014 offensive, those militias became integral to Iraq\u2019s survival. Iran has now infected Iraq\u2019s political and military infrastructure, with the Shia militias becoming Iraq\u2019s version of Iran\u2019s Republican Guard.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIran also has transformed Syria from a strategic ally to a virtual proxy; Syrian President Bashar al-Assad owes his life to Hezbollah and to the Quds Force, Iran\u2019s special operations forces. Russian airpower decisively tipped the scales in Assad\u2019s favor, but Iranian intervention during the first four years of war ensured his survival.\n\nIran has now created a land corridor from Kermanshah to Latakia and Beirut, linking Tehran to the eastern Mediterranean. It is no coincidence that Iran solidified these gains between 2015 and 2017, when the JCPOA nuclear deal gave it greater economic and political flexibility. Today, Iran pairs its overland highway to the Levantine Basin with its Yemenite foothold, provided by Houthi insurgents. All the while, its nuclear program remains untouched, and ballistic missile development continues apace.\n\nIran\u2019s most recent attack on Saudi oil production demonstrates the sophistication and extent of Iranian capabilities. Iran used Ababil 2 drones and Quds-1 cruise missiles to execute the attack. Neither weapon has the needed precision when controlled from a distance, so it is likely that Iranian intelligence infiltrated Saudi Arabia and guided the weapons in their terminal phase. This constitutes one of the great U.S. intelligence failures since 9/11 \u2014 a U.S. ally\u2019s oil production crippled due to large-scale sabotage by a hostile power.\n\nStrategically, only America and Israel can check Iranian ambitions. The U.S. maintains a network of Middle Eastern and European bases from which it can concentrate ground and air forces against any point in the region; a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf or Eastern Mediterranean greatly complicates Iran\u2019s ability to operate freely in Syria and Iraq, or to close the Strait of Hormuz and pressure U.S. allies in Asia. Moreover, U.S. diplomatic, financial and commercial pressure can still strangle the Iranian economy, despite the damage the JCPOA and its aftermath did to the U.S. sanctions regime. Unless Iran can eliminate U.S. presence in the Middle East, its broader campaign will remain constricted.\n\nWhile American military and economic power consistently shackle Iranian ambitions, Israel\u2019s military capabilities pose the most credible threat to Iran\u2019s strategic gains on the ground. Israel operates the region\u2019s most sophisticated military force. Its fleet of F-15s and F-16s could achieve air parity even with Russian forces, let alone Iran\u2019s.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is known for its operational creativity, so Iran must expect an unpredictable response to every one of its defensive redundancies. Israel couples its conventional capabilities with a world-class intelligence service that has already penetrated Iranian defenses, neutralized Iranian nuclear scientists, obtained sensitive information on its nuclear program and potentially engineered the Stuxnet virus that targeted Iranian centrifuges.\n\nIsrael\u2019s probable nuclear capabilities make it the greater strategic threat. Even with weapons of mass destruction, Iran cannot simply blackmail Israel to achieve its goals. Critically, Israel is willing to use these capabilities to counter Iranian expansion; it has conducted airstrikes against Iranian targets in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq \u2014 the latter with Russian consent \u2014 and used force twice to eliminate hostile nuclear programs. So long as Israel exists, Iranian ambitions cannot be fulfilled.\n\nOne must also identify an ideological element to Iran\u2019s strategy. Anti-Semitism is central to Iran\u2019s identity; its founding Khomeinist ideology identified the Jews as blasphemers who defiled the Quran. Iran\u2019s pretension to Islamic leadership rings hollow because Islam\u2019s three holiest cities \u2014 Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem \u2014 all lie in its enemies\u2019 hands: The Saudis control the first two; Israel, the third.\n\nThese facts explain the link between Hezbollah and the nuclear program, the two pillars of Iranian strategy. Iran hopes to use Hezbollah to occupy Israel\u2019s and America\u2019s attention, particularly drawing the former\u2019s resources into prolonged ground wars. Hezbollah, like Iranian-sponsored Hamas, is a threat Israel cannot ignore. By placing Israel on the defensive, Iran gains a free hand to consolidate its control over Syria and Iraq, and to pressure America and its Arab allies.\n\nMost important, it can expand its nuclear infrastructure and perfect its delivery systems. Iran need not sprint for breakout immediately. It would rather cultivate its regional position using irregular capabilities and proxies, while avoiding direct confrontation with the United States and Israel for as long as possible.\n\nThe ultimate goal will be a nuclear attack against Israel. Unable to conventionally destroy the Jewish state, Iran can instead obliterate Israel\u2019s coastal population centers. Israel\u2019s subsequent counterattack is unlikely to deter Iran \u2014 not, however, because Iran is \u201cirrational.\u201d The Islamic Republic lost 2 percent of its population in the Iran-Iraq War; equivalent losses today would total more than 16 million dead \u2014 an amount that would require eliminating Iran\u2019s five largest cities. There are, it seems, situations in which Iran would \u201cthink about the unthinkable.\u201d\n\nGiven this possibility, Israel and America ought to modify their understanding of Hezbollah: It is not a primary threat but the means to a broader end.\n\nThe next conflict with Hezbollah presents three broad options. First, strike Hezbollah in Lebanon. This will entail a large Israeli ground commitment and has no guarantee of success. The long-term benefits of anything less than total victory are not readily apparent.\n\nSecond, strike Iran\u2019s positions in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, ripping out the infrastructure Tehran has constructed over the past decade. This will take greater coordination and military capacity \u2014 the IDF will need to conduct a broad, multi-phase campaign primarily in the air against Iranian, and likely Syrian and Lebanese, targets. Israel must judge whether Russia will permit such actions, and gauge the costs and benefits accordingly. Nevertheless, while option two provides benefits, it only buys Israel time.\n\nThe third option, striking Iran directly and crippling its nuclear program, is the most ambitious, most risky and most rewarding. If successful, it could ensure Israeli security for 10 to 20 years. But it would be a massive logistical undertaking, which may be beyond the IDF\u2019s capacity. Political considerations must be weighed \u2014 the role of America and the Sunni Arab monarchies, and Russia\u2019s likely hostile response. Moreover, Israel\u2019s government remains in flux; it may face the dismaying prospect of going to war without a prime minister.\n\nRegardless of the option chosen, Israel and America must recognize that option three, a direct strike against Iran, will become necessary. History contains many examples of powers that knew the stakes of a confrontation yet refused to strike early. Athens and Sparta hoped to stave off war as long as possible. Sparta required unquestionable primacy, Athens an equal position to Sparta\u2019s. Each demanded what the other could not give.\n\nSeth Cropsey is a senior fellow at Hudson Institute and director of its Center for American Seapower.
