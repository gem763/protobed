If it did, this would have been the largest ransomware payment ever made, dwarfing the previous record of $1 million, held by a South Korean web hosting firm.\n\nBut even knowing they couldn't pay, Mayor Mitchell said the city decided to engage in a conversation with the hackers, so IT staff would have more time to bolster the city's defenses and protect their network in the case the attackers would take other actions, besides just running ransomware.\n\n\"In light of these considerations, I decided to make a counter-offer using insurance proceeds in the amount of $400,000, which I determined to be consistent with ransoms recently paid by other municipalities,\" Mayor Mitchell said.\n\n\"The attacker declined to make a counter-offer, rejecting the city's position outright.\"\n\nAt that point, realizing that the hackers wouldn't negotiate, the New Bedford mayor said they decided to restore from backups.\n\nThe city's decision to restore from backups was an easy one, due to the low number of infected systems, and the fact that no critical systems had been impacted by the ransomware. This made managing the public's pressure easier than in other municipalities where ransomware infections effectively crippled almost all city services.\n\nMayor Mitchell's full press conference is available below, courtesy of The Standard-Times, whose reporters also broke the story earlier today.\n\nIn recent months, US cities have been a prime target for ransomware gangs. Below are just some of the most high-profile cases that impacted US municipalities:\n\nA recent ProPublica investigation found that insurance firms are inadvertently fueling the ransomware economy by advising cities to pay ransom demands, rather than rebuild IT networks -- as ransom payments are always cheaper for the insurance firm to cover.\n\nThis rise in the number of successful ransom payments has, in turn, attracted more ransomware gangs, breathing new life into the ransomware landscape that appeared to had died off and slowed down last year.", "description": "New Bedford officials decide to restore from backups after negotiations fail.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/09/20/6deb7a17-39a5-4186-9f04-4ee4f28574dc/thumbnail/770x578/1f5477e285617e09972e72ce29143361/istock-92005386.jpg"}
