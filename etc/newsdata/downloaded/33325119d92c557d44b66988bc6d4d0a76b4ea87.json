The hooks underneath were perfect for hanging her jacket and dressing gown and the whole thing could fold flat if not needed. A bargain, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nAddis easi 3-tier airer: \u00a332.50, Amazon\n\nA quality rack with sturdy struts and joints, this comes with a three-year guarantee. In a quality grey and turquoise finish, there\u2019s plenty of room for a larger load of wet wash. We like that it's really easy to put up and use.

You can set the timer for up to three hours \u2013 we certainly needed that for several pairs of heavy jeans at once. More successfully, our tester filled the pod with 12 shirts for the working week ahead and found they were cupboard dry in around an hour and a quarter. We\u2019d use this for delicates every day of the week, as they came out with very few creases too.\n\nBuy now\n\nVileda premium 2 in 1 indoor table drier: \u00a327.99, Amazon\n\nIf you want to dry indoors, use this well-constructed airer on wheels.
