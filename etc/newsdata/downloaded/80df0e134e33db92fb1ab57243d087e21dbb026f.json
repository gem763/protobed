Ms. Bland apparently took her life in a Texas jail in 2015, three days after a routine traffic stop. The situation escalated after a police officer took issue with the fact that while in her car, Ms. Bland lighted a cigarette and refused to extinguish it.\n\nThe book provides fodder both for fans of Mr. Gladwell\u2019s contrarian narratives and critics who say he cherry-picks anecdotes and states the obvious. The Journal spoke with him about talking to strangers and watching \u201cFriends.\u201d Edited excerpts:\n\nYou seem to be trying to prove something that reasonable people agree on\u2014that we should give people the benefit of the doubt and that you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\n\nI think that\u2019s true of a lot of my writing, that what I\u2019m trying to do is give us more complete and convincing explanations for common sense positions. You know, I\u2019m not arguing an outrageous position here, but I do think that we deviate from common sense a lot in the way that we make sense of others.\n\nYou wrote \u201cThe death of Sandra Bland is what happens when a society does not know how to talk to strangers.\u201d Does that mean you don\u2019t think her arrest was racially motivated?\n\nI spend almost no time at all talking about race in this book, which does not mean that I think race isn\u2019t a relevant consideration. On the contrary, I think race powerfully runs through many of these encounters, particularly that encounter. My issue with describing these encounters solely in racial terms is: What do you do next? Like, how do you fix it? Are you going to go and change the hearts of every police officer in America?\n\nSome critics say you present contributing factors as causation. You write that the death of Sandra Bland is what happens when society doesn\u2019t know how to talk to strangers\u2014not that it\u2019s due to many things and that this is a small part of it. Would you say that\u2019s fair?\n\nI would say that books are not term papers. If you write a term paper on the causes of the second World War, your professor, I think appropriately, wants you to be comprehensive. You can\u2019t just say the second World War was about the economic aftermath of a bad settlement of the first World War. You\u2019ve got to talk about Hitler, you\u2019ve got to talk about ideology. But a book is not that. Books have a very different function. And sometimes, particularly in my books, what I\u2019m trying to do is to shed light on ways of making sense of things that have not received appropriate attention in the past.\n\nIf we\u2019re chronically misunderstanding the actions and intentions of strangers, should we also behave as if our own actions and intentions are being misunderstood?\n\nOh, yeah. When I talked about caution and humility, it applies not just to our attempts to make sense of others, but also to our understanding of how we ought to express ourselves, that we need to understand and keep in the back of our minds the notion that our behavior is not transparent.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you think about some of the takeaways in Mr. Gladwell\u2019s new book, such as a person\u2019s outward behavior isn\u2019t always a good barometer of what\u2019s going on inside? Join the discussion below.\n\nYou wrote \u201cWe believe someone\u2019s demeanor is a window into their soul\u201d and that we think real life is like \u201cFriends.\u201d Have you ever met someone who believes that?\n\nSure. In fact, I think most people think that way. I mean, that\u2019s not a feeling. There is a voluminous literature, for example, which goes back many, many years and encompasses a huge pile of research papers which look at what the attitudes of people in law enforcement are on the usefulness of facial expressions and demeanor in interpreting peoples\u2019 truth or falsity. And what you discover is that among the people for whom this kind of question matters\u2014cops interrogating people\u2014they overwhelmingly think real life is like \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nBut we know \u201cFriends\u201d is a caricature and that\u2019s why we have clich\u00e9s like \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve got to walk a mile in someone\u2019s shoes.\u201d\n\nWell, we have those clich\u00e9s precisely because we don\u2019t abide by them, right? We have the clich\u00e9 \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d because we are guilty of judging books by their cover. We remind our children to walk a mile in a man\u2019s shoes before you judge them because we don\u2019t walk a mile in people\u2019s shoes, right? So, the mere fact that those clich\u00e9s are so culturally prevalent ought to be proof of how routinely we deviate from them.", "description": "In \u2018Talking to Strangers,\u2019 the journalist and podcaster argues that behavior doesn\u2019t always reflect a person\u2019s real thoughts.", "authors": ["Chris Kornelis"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104315/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
