(Charles Krupa/AP)\n\nOliver Bullough, a frequent contributor to the Guardian, is the author of \u201cMoneyland: The Inside Story of the Crooks and Kleptocrats who Rule the World.\u201d\n\nUkraine recently held a democratic election that ushered in a peaceful transfer of power; it is stubbornly resisting an onslaught by Russian-backed troops; it is making small but significant steps toward restraining corruption. With democracy on the retreat worldwide, Ukraine may be the closest thing the West has to a foreign policy win.\n\nTo cement that victory, Ukraine needs more of what it has received since its 2014 revolution: Western money, Western support and sustained Western insistence that its rulers keep their promises to clean up their country.\n\nWhat it does not need is underinformed dinosaurs wading into its sensitive political ecosystem to make points for domestic American consumption. Unfortunately, this is precisely what is now happening \u2014 thanks to President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nAlmost as long as there have been questions over Trump\u2019s Russian dealings, there have been rival questions about former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s role in post-revolutionary Ukraine. To sort out the truth, it\u2019s imperative to understand two things. The first is that Biden\u2019s son Hunter took a job at a Ukrainian oligarch\u2019s gas company, known as Burisma, shortly after the 2014 revolution, which was unwise, greedy and rightly criticized at the time.\n\nThe second is that Joe Biden was the White House\u2019s Ukraine enforcer, and it was in this capacity that he forced Ukraine\u2019s president to sack an at-best ineffectual prosecutor general as a condition for a billion dollars\u2019 worth of loans. Biden has himself boasted of this episode, and most Ukrainians are perfectly content about it, since they saw prosecutor Viktor Shokin as incapable of the investigations needed to uncover the previous regime\u2019s crimes.\n\nThe trouble began when right-wing bloggers sought to meld these two points into a single conspiracy in which Joe Biden had the prosecutor sacked to protect his son\u2019s business interests. I may be an outsider to the bewildering mess that is Ukrainian politics, but, on this particular issue, I have a genuine insight into what happened, having written extensively about Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-employer, Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nAs a result, when journalists seek the fire behind the smoke in the Biden-Ukraine tale, they often call to ask my opinion. Many are eager to flesh out what seems a satisfyingly simple conspiracy, but I have to tell them: It isn\u2019t true. The timeline doesn\u2019t work. The investigation into Burisma, Hunter Biden\u2019s employer, had ground to a halt long before the prosecutor was sacked. A subsequent probe into the company\u2019s owner was opened because of a request from Ukrainian legislators, not because of prosecutorial initiative. There is, in short, no there there; the bloggers are putting two and two together \u2014 and coming up with 22.\n\nHunter Biden should not have taken the job; Joe Biden should probably not have boasted about bullying the president of another country. But those are judgment matters for them personally, not proof of conspiracy, and certainly not an affair worth destabilizing the fragile democracy of a new U.S. ally.\n\nBut that has not stopped Giuliani, who tweeted last week: \u201chow deep and how high did the alleged Ukraine conspiracy go?\u201d He was responding to a story in the New York Times (the Times apparently not \u201cfailing\u201d on this occasion, since Trump retweeted the paper\u2019s story), which analyzed the theories around the Bidens\u2019 Ukraine connection. The article ticked all the journalistic boxes, giving father and son space to deny wrongdoing, but still raised a cloud of smoke for those shouting \u201cfire.\u201d If a major newspaper devotes 2,500 words to conflict-of-interest questions, then those questions presumably exist. How often do you beat your wife?\n\nThis non-scandal appears to have already wrecked the career of the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, a respected career diplomat who is leaving her post this month. That will inevitably affect the continuity of U.S. anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. It is also emboldening oligarchs opposed to the activists who have led the fight against corruption, because they also campaigned for Shokin to be sacked and risk being blackened by association.\n\nPresident-elect Volodymyr Zelensky is assembling his team, and it is imperative that the West stay as firm with him as it was with his predecessor on fulfilling the conditions that went with its loans. One official he should consider jettisoning is current General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, who has not only been as ineffective as Shokin at prosecuting the crooks of the past, but has also been feeding Giuliani the partial information that underpins his conspiracy.\n\nWe are all resigned to the fact that U.S. politicians will do their utmost to divide their nation still further over the next two years. But Giuliani must stop using Ukraine as a political pi\u00f1ata. It is a country of 44 million people who are defending their freedom at the cost of much blood. There was a time that all Americans would have applauded them for that, regardless of party. It is shameful that petty political considerations have blinded Trump\u2019s allies to that truth.\n\nRead more:\n\nEd Rogers: Why are some people down on Joe Biden?\n\nPaul Waldman: Trump is already set to use the government to destroy the Democratic nominee\n\nHenry Olsen: Old fissures reemerge in Ukraine.
