The winner will play a crucial role in the country\u2019s quest to end the war with the Taliban and the resumption of talks between the insurgents and the US that were called off earlier this month.\n\nThe hardline insurgent group, which controls more of the country than at any time since its regime was toppled in 2001, has threatened voters to stay away from the election or face dire consequences.\n\nAn explosion on Saturday inside a polling station in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar was confirmed by local officials, as witnesses said an ambulance rushed to the area. Bahir Ahmadi, a spokesman for Kandahar\u2019s provincial governor, said so far three wounded people had been transferred to the hospital.\n\nExplosions also hit the cities of Kabul, Ghazni and Jalalabad, officials said.\n\nAfghanistan turns to biometrics to tackle election fraud Read more\n\nTo protect voters and polling stations from Taliban attacks, tens of thousands of Afghan forces have been deployed across 34 provinces. About 9.6 million of Afghanistan\u2019s 34 million people are registered to vote for one of the 14 candidates at about 5,000 polling centres, which will be protected by some 100,000 Afghan forces with air support from US forces.\n\n\u201cBravado gets defined when one musters courage to cast their vote in Afghanistan,\u201d said Roya Jahangir, a doctor based in the capital of Kabul.\n\nJahangir said she and her husband would cast their votes even if it meant standing in long queues for hours. \u201cWe hope this time there is no fraud \u2013 otherwise voters will feel cheated once again.\u201d\n\nMedia showed lines of men and women outside numerous polling stations, indicating strong turnout in some areas.\n\nIn the northern province of Balkh, voters waited for election officials to arrive at polling stations set up in schools, colleges, mosques, hospital campuses and district centres.\n\nMore than 400 polling centres will remain closed because they are in areas under Taliban control. Hundreds more will be closed because of security concerns.\n\nThe voting process is another source of concern. The country\u2019s Independent Election Commission (IEC) has come under criticism for issuing contradictory and unclear statements over what processes will be in place to prevent fraud if biometric systems fail during the eight hours of voting.\n\nFour of the 18 candidates have dropped out of the race, but their names remain on the biometric voting devices.\n\nGhani and his former deputy Abdullah both came to power in 2014 after a bitterly contested election marred by fraud.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s political scene is still tainted by the aftermath of that disputed presidential vote which forced the two main rival groupings to form an unstable partnership. Both sides were accused of massive electoral cheating.\n\nWestern security sources and Afghan officials said they had asked local media not to sensationalise threats and attacks, concerned that they could discourage voting.\n\nThe election is the fourth presidential vote since the fall of the Taliban to US-led forces.", "description": "President Ashraf Ghani and his former deputy Abdullah Abdullah the frontrunners as millions head to the polls", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5104116e0169b5094e7e3471d38a3a66ce848cee/0_84_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e04aef7c99922f882e16ada1fc7e966b", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
