They\u2019ve taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nTwo reporters from The New York Times published an excerpt from their forthcoming book on Saturday that contained details of a new sexual misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh.\n\nMax Stier, who used to be Kavanaugh\u2019s classmate in the 1980s, told reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly that he saw the then-Yale University freshman with his pants down while his friends pushed his penis into the hands of a female student at a dorm party.\n\nHe said he approached senators and the FBI with the allegation during confirmation hearings last year, according to the Times. The Washington Post confirmed Monday that Sen. Christopher Coons (D-Del.) also asked the FBI to look into the allegations after Stier approached him with the claim but that the bureau didn\u2019t take on the senator\u2019s request.\n\nTrump told the rally crowd on Monday that the Times put out a \u201cmajor apology,\u201d referring to an editors\u2019 note at the bottom of the story in which the reporters said the female student Stier alleged he saw declined to be interviewed and that her friends say she does not recall the incident. The Times did put out an apology, but that was for an offensive and graphic tweet that was posted about the article.\n\nEarlier in the rally, Trump also told the crowd that everyone is \u201clooking much better than they did three years ago\u201d but that he can\u2019t say that in the Me Too era. He said it again, adding, \u201cincluding the men.\u201d Later, after his Kavanaugh comments, Trump bashed journalists for negative media coverage of him, saying, \u201cYou know, when you think of it: I\u2019m president, and they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nTrump on negative media coverage from \"phony\" journalists: \"You know, when you think of it: I'm president and they're not.\" There is a loud cheer. \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 17, 2019\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump said that Kavanaugh is really the one \u201cbeing assaulted\u201d and that the Times \u201cshould be sued\u201d because it is \u201clooking to destroy, and influence his [Kavanaugh\u2019s] opinions.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the president tweeted that Kavanaugh should \u201cstart suing people for [libel], or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.\u201d\n\nBefore the Times report this weekend, Kavanaugh had faced allegations of sexual assault or misconduct from three women, one of whom was at the center of Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s excerpt. Deborah Ramirez was a classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s at Yale, and she reported that he exposed himself to her during a drinking game at a dorm \u2015 an accusation similar to the one Stier made.\n\nAnother of the accusers, psychology researcher Christine Blasey Ford, gave emotional testimony to the Senate last year that was broadcast live. Ford alleged that Kavanaugh tried to rape her when they were both in high school. Kavanaugh was still confirmed to the Supreme Court and has been celebrated by the president.\n\nMore than 20 women have accused Trump himself of sexual misconduct. He has denied all of the accusations.", "description": "The president defended the Supreme Court justice at his New Mexico rally after new allegations of sexual misconduct were uncovered by Times reporters.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8042952300001c05551a65.jpeg?cache=w1tisfvgr3&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
