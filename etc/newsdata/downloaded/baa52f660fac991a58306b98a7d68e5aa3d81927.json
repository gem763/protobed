The company has flip-flopped repeatedly on whether the app should be allowed in the store, initially telling developers: \u201cYour app contains content \u2013 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2013 that is not legal \u2026 specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement,\u201d and banning the app.\n\nFollowing outcry over the initial banning, the app was reinstated to Apple\u2019s store. Now, following criticism from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper, The People\u2019s Daily, which stated that the app \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior,\u201d leading it to question if Apple was \u201cguiding Hong Kong thugs,\u201d The Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have once against bowed to the wishes of communist China.\n\nApple has once again banned the app saying in a statement:\n\nWe created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong. Many concerned customers in Hong Kong have contacted us about this app and we immediately began investigating it. The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\n\nHKmap developers said in response to Apple\u2019s statement:\n\nThere is 0 evidence to support CSTCB\u2019s accusation. HKmap App never solicits, promotes, or encourages criminal activity. HKmap App consolidates information from user and public sources, e.g. live news stream, Facebook and Telegram.\n\nApple has not clarified which \u201clocal laws\u201d the HKmap.live app violates. Apple also removed the app of news outlet Quartz from its Chinese app store this week, the news outlet has been providing strong coverage of the Hong Kong protests.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
