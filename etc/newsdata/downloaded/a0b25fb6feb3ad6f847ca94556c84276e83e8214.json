A crowd of 16,300 turned out for the event.\n\n\u201cWe apologize for the Snoop Dogg performance at Late Night,\u201d Athletic Director Jeff Long said in a statement. \u201cWe made it clear to the entertainers\u2019 managers that we expected a clean version of the show and took additional steps to communicate to our fans, including moving the artist to the final act of the evening, to ensure that no basketball activities would be missed if anyone did not want to stay for his show.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take full responsibility for not thoroughly vetting all the details of the performance and offer my personal apology to those who were offended. We strive to create a family atmosphere at Kansas and fell short of that this evening.\u201d\n\nThe rapper met with the players in the locker room before the show and wore a blue No. 20 Kansas jersey.\n\nDuring the performance, he shot a money gun full of fake $100 bills featuring his face over the team bench areas.\n\nSongs included Gun and Juice and Drop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\n\nIn a video produced by the school promoting the event, men\u2019s basketball coach Bill Self is wearing a shirt with a large \u201cAdidas Basketball\u201d logo and a chain with a \u201c$\u201d sign.\n\nSelf, who said he didn\u2019t see most of the performance, said he was told the performance would be appropriate.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was going to be anything like that,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI was told this was radio edited and everything else, so I don\u2019t guess you have visuals on radio.
