The latest attack triggered the biggest surge in oil prices since 1991.\n\nIran's Yemeni allies have promised more strikes to come. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group carried out Saturday's pre-dawn attack with drones, including some powered by jet engines.\n\nBut several U.S. officials say they believe that the attack on Saudi Arabia came from the opposite direction, possibly from Iran itself rather than Yemen.\n\nOn Sunday, one U.S. official said: \"There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate.\"\n\nThe war in Yemen, where the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates lead an air campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels, is considered one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.
