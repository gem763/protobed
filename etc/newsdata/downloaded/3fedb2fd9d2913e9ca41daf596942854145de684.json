After each incident, Carter has managed to return to some of his normal routines, such as teaching Sunday school and doing charity work.\n\nWhile on his way from church to lunch on Oct. 6, Carter fell and hit his forehead \"on a sharp edge\" at his home. The fall required 14 stitches and left him with a bruised left eye. Days after the fall, Carter was in Nashville, Tennessee, to assist in building homes for Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThe former president broke his hip during a fall at his home in May just prior to a turkey hunting trip. He was released days later, saying at the time he planned to teach Sunday school that weekend.\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter had a fall yesterday evening at his home in Plains, Ga. He has been admitted to Phoebe Sumter Medical Center for observation and treatment of a minor pelvic fracture. He is in good spirits and is looking forward to recovering at home. \u2014 The Carter Center (@CarterCenter) October 22, 2019\n\nCarter served as president from 1977 to 1981 and was previously treated for cancer.\n\nIn August 2015, he had a small lump removed from his liver. He later revealed that month that he had melanoma in his brain and liver. However, Carter announced in December 2015 after months of treatment that his scans showed no more signs of cancer.\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin, Jordan Culver and Jessica Bies\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/22/jimmy-carter-falls-suffers-pelvic-fracture-plains-georgia-home/4060831002/", "description": "Former President Jimmy Carter was taken\u00a0to the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center for \"observation and treatment,\"\u00a0according to the Carter Center", "authors": ["Sean Rossman", "Published A.M.
