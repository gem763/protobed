Both were granted anonymity in the case.\n\nRachael Clarke, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), the UK\u2019s largest abortion provider, said the UK government has made it clear that there will not be abortion services provided by the NHS in Northern Ireland until after March next year.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe law that was passed by Westminster makes it clear that it has to abide by the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which is an international treaty adopted by the UN. It states you have to provide abortions services for women in cases of rape, incest and fetal abnormality and also says women have to be able to have an abortion in the country. Our expectation is from next spring abortion will be available to women in all cases.\u201d\n\nMs Clarke said the ability to access an abortion in the interim period was dependent on \u201cwhat doctors feel comfortable providing\u201d \u2013 noting that GPs in Northern Ireland have not been trained to provide abortion and there is \u201cno structure in place\u201d to provide terminations.\n\nShe said the government was obliged to pass secondary legislation by March next year which outlines who will provide abortion care and how they will do so.\n\n\u201cBut the underlying law around criminality has already changed,\u201d Ms Clarke added. \u201cHaving an abortion before the 22 week mark is no longer a crime. We should not underestimate what a huge step forward this is. It is a fundamental change in the law that has been blocked time and time again.\n\n\u201cThe law in Northern Ireland had the harshest punishment in the world for abortion \u2013 life in jail. The process of being forced to travel abroad for an abortion is traumatising. It is an unacceptable way of outsourcing your nation\u2019s healthcare needs. We hear time and time again from women who don\u2019t tell anyone they are travelling to have an abortion because there is such a stigma around this kind of healthcare.\u201d", "description": "Abortion might have just been decriminalised in Northern Ireland but it will take some time for the new laws around terminations to be decided on and clearly outlined.
