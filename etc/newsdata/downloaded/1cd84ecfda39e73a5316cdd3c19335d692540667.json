Some of the documents were found hidden in their private vehicles on the premises.\n\n\"The vehicle testing owner, manager, examiners and an administration clerk are among those who were apprehended. Documents, computers and cellphones were also seized.\"\n\nHe said the number of officials arrested as part of the ongoing operation now stood at 15.\n\n\"Four other suspects, who included three examiners and an administration clerk, were re-arrested at the Phalala vehicle testing station in Lephalale on Monday.
