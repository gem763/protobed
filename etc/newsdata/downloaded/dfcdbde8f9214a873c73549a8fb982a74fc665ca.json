(Getty Images)\n\nLions get robbed vs. Packers\n\nFirst up was a \u201chands to the face\u201d penalty against Lions defensive end Trey Flowers that turned a sack of Aaron Rodgers and fourth-and-21 situation into first-and-10 for the Packers in Detroit territory.\n\nSubsequent replay showed that Flowers was holding Packers tackle David Bakhtiari\u2019s shoulder pads, not his facemask.\n\nWhat \u201chands to the face\u201d looks like\n\n\n\nFrom a punt to a TD, all because of the refs. Just disgusting. pic.twitter.com/K2ho1fBFEy \u2014 Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) October 15, 2019\n\nThe Packers would later score on a Rodgers touchdown pass.\n\nDuring the Lions\u2019 next drive, Matthew Stafford uncorked a deep pass to Marvin Jones that would have set up a prime scoring opportunity for the Lions. Packers safety Will Redmond defended the pass by draping his arm over Jones\u2019 chest and arms without looking at the ball. The refs did not call pass interference on the resulting incompletion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSorry not the outcome we want.. no pass interference here \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m sorry for you guys out in Detroit #LambeauRefs pic.twitter.com/f8DzHj818j \u2014 Rick Sosa (@sosarick) October 15, 2019\n\nHistory repeated when the Packers got the ball back and entered the red zone, as Flowers was again called for hands to the face against Bakhtiari. Again, replay showed Flowers\u2019 hands on Bakhtiari\u2019s shoulder pads.\n\nESPN analyst Booger McFarland simply couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. He probably wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nFlowers went so far as to reportedly demonstrate where he grabbed Bakhtiari after the game.\n\nTrey Flowers was still in his pads when reporters were let into the Lions locker room. He said he did not commit a penalty.\n\n\n\nFlowers demonstrated where he grabs at the pads and said he\u2019s done that his entire career and throughout the game. \u2014 Brad Galli (@BradGalli) October 15, 2019\n\nAdd up those three missed calls plus a bogus unnecessary roughness penalty earlier in the game, and you have quite a few Lions fans correctly arguing that the officiating cost them the game. Instead of 3-1-1, the Lions are now 2-2-1 and in last place in the NFC North.\n\nDetroit, other football fans not happy with blown calls\n\nQuite a few Detroit figures and football fans were mad online after the game, including the best player in Lions history, a Twitch superstar who was born in Detroit and attending the game and the city\u2019s paper of record.\n\nI know that no one on the @lions can say it, so I will... that is a terrible missed call, on hands to the face and bad break for our D that is playing so hard. #replayhelpneeded \u2014 Barry Sanders (@BarrySanders) October 15, 2019\n\nThat is sickening... the @NFL needs to look at a way to prevent that from happening. Two phantom hands to the face calls really hurts us tonight. Yes, we could have scored TDs, but @Lions played too well to have the game end this way. #DETvsGB @espn \u2014 Barry Sanders (@BarrySanders) October 15, 2019\n\n\ud83e\udd2c4 major blown calls tonight , all four went against the Lions. DB going for the INT called for Unnecessary Roughness. A non call on a blatant DPI . Then two ridiculous calls for hands to the face. Refs can\u2019t guess and can\u2019t get these wrong. Lions would\u2019ve won by 2 scores @NFL \u2014 Jack Del Rio (@coachdelrio) October 15, 2019\n\nHow much are the Packers paying the refs \u2014 Ninja (@Ninja) October 15, 2019\n\nLiterally never going to another game again. Cancelling my tickets to the Lions game. \u2014 Ninja (@Ninja) October 15, 2019\n\nAnd to think one of the 2 hands to the face calls was against the @Lions @III_Flowers on this play. One set up a touchdown and the other a game winning field goal for the @packers . It's 2019 and we need to get these calls right. #OnePride #GoPackGo pic.twitter.com/jhGjpCqUBh \u2014 Merril Hoge (@merrilhoge) October 15, 2019\n\nDon\u2019t blame us Detroit. We're not the ones who pushed the \u201crefs are trash\u201d button. \u2014 Buffalo Wild Wings (@BWWings) October 15, 2019\n\nAfter what I\u2019ve seen in the past two weeks I\u2019m convinced the league do not want the Lions to win. EVER! It\u2019s not sour grapes either it\u2019s true. The league owes the Lions an apology! \u2014 Ken Kal (@KenKalDRW) October 15, 2019\n\nThe bogus personal foul and the non call Pass Interference was six more points. Four wrong calls is hard to imagine. https://t.co/GUoT0h7JV4 \u2014 Tony Dungy (@TonyDungy) October 15, 2019\n\nHere's my initial thoughts on the ref's absolute CHOKE JOB in Green Bay. #Lions were screwed, yes they missed chances on FG's not being TD's, no denying that, but these calls directly effected the outcome. pic.twitter.com/qCCiBY2V1F \u2014 Justin Rose (@JRoseWXYZ) October 15, 2019\n\nVan Pelt and Booger destroying the refs, as they should. Rip the Lions all you want for not scoring in the red zone. Totally fair. But they did make plays down the stretch that the refs wiped away. \u2014 Bob Wojnowski (@bobwojnowski) October 15, 2019\n\nFinal: Packers 23, Lions 22.\n\n\n\nLions blow a 13-point lead, settle for 5 field goals and have multiple blown calls go against them but, on the bright side, in 5 billion years the sun will swell into a red giant, vaporize the Earth and obliterate all evidence of this game happening \u2014 Detroit Free Press (@freep) October 15, 2019\n\nWatching the Detroit Lions is like eating a sandwich\n\n\n\nExcept the sandwich is on fire\n\n\n\nYou're on fire\n\n\n\nEverything's on fire\n\n\n\nAnd you're in hell\n\n\n\nWatching the Lions \u2014 Detroit Free Press (@freep) October 15, 2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "More than a few Lions fans felt robbed by the officials during the team's loss to the Packers.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6jOOdoeXJPFLRvW5H7MfzQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MzAuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FrZ7mE3paqnoz8S4m0Vhsw--~B/aD0yMTgxO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a8774ce0-ef00-11e9-bbf7-86c175de6b98", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
