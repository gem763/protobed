She was airlifted to a Montpellier hospital by helicopter but died a few hours later, according to an official.\n\nHenry Sanchez, the mayor of Cazouls d\u2019H\u00e9rault, had visited the woman and advised her to leave her home as the floodwaters were rising. \u201cShe could have gone upstairs as water was starting to come into the house,\u201d said Mr Sanchez, who described her as physically \u201cfragile\u201d.\n\nHe called the fire brigade to rescue her, but by the time they arrived some 90 minutes later, she had left, apparently panicked by the rising floodwaters. \u201cThere was a torrent in front of her house near the River Boyne. She was found about 80 or 100 metres away. She couldn\u2019t go any further because vines blocked the way.\u201d\n\nMr Sanchez, 66, said she was well known in the village where she had lived for more than 20 years and many residents were shocked. \u201cA lot of people here are very emotional.\u201d", "description": "A British woman was among three people who have died in floods in southern France, where heavy rain caused rivers to burst their banks, it emerged on Friday.", "authors": ["David Chazan", "Emily Hill", "Nigel Farage", "John Longworth", "Tom Harris", "Asa Bennett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000213977498-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWcv5yZLmao6LolmWYJrXns.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
