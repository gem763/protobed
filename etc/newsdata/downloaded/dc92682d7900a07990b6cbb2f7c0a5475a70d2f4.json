(Picture: Netflix)\n\nStranger Things may have confirmed the fate of Jim Hopper right at the very end of season 3 and it was staring at us all this entire time.\n\nThe trippy Netflix series, which was renewed for season 4 this week, closed with Joyce (played by Winona Ryder) sacrificing Hopper (David Harbour) to spare Hawkins being taken over by the Mind Flayer and the USSR.\n\nIt was devastating. And then, once the credits rolled, we were given another headache as it turned out someone we know only as \u2018The American\u2019 is being held captive and will likely be the centre of the story when Stranger Things returns next year.\n\nAll the signs are pointing to Hopper (or Barb!), but one eagle-eyed fan has noticed a hidden message in the title credits which quite literally spells out \u2018Hopper is alive.\u2019\n\nCoincidence? Possibly, but showrunners The Duffer Brothers are notorious for leaving trails of telling breadcrumbs in the unlikeliest of places.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatt and Ross Duffer haven\u2019t quite confirmed Hopper\u2019s whereabouts \u2013 if he still exists \u2013 but they did compare his journey to Han Solo which is a humongous clue if you know your Star Wars.\n\nHopper can\u2019t be gone, surely? (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018We always talk about Empire Strikes Back, we always wanted to give him a darker ending, we always wanted to give him a Han Solo sacrifice moment,\u2019 Matt told Entertainment Weekly.\n\n\u2018It was emotional to shoot but it was really, really quick. David never asked for music but I think we did play some emotional music when we shot David\u2019s final look at Winona [Ryder].\u2019\n\nHan famously came back fighting in Return of The Jedi so, you know, we pray.\n\nMetro.co.uk compiled all the evidence Hopper will be back for season 4, and there\u2019s a lot.\n\nStranger Things seasons one to three are available to stream on Netflix. Season four is expected to drop in 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
