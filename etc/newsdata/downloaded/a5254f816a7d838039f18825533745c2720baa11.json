The right-hander has a 3.70 ERA and a 1.05 WHIP while allowing five home runs in his four postseason appearances. And the key for Verlander\u2019s opponents is to get to him early.\n\nHe has allowed 10 runs this postseason and seven have come in the first inning and that\u2019s not something unique to the playoffs. Verlander\u2019s 3.18 first inning ERA was his worst between the first and sixth innings.\n\nThe long layoff seems to have not effected the Nationals bats. They\u2019re locked in right now, take them to get on the scoreboard first in Game 2.\n\nPick: First Team to Score - Nationals (-120)\n\nFIRST FIVE INNINGS\n\nThat said, Verlander can settle in even if he gives up a few runs early. And the guy opposing him for Game 2 is throwing fire right now.\n\nStrasburg looks nearly unhittable, pitching to a 1.64 ERA and a 0.86 WHIP with 33 strikeouts and just one walk in 22 innings this postseason. Now, the right-hander faces an Astros lineup that has done enough to get to this point, the numbers aren\u2019t the greatest.\n\nStory continues\n\nHouston is hitting just .213 this postseason and are striking out a lot, like 115 times in 403 at bats a lot. Strasburg is not the type of pitcher you get back on track against. We\u2019re taking this one to be low scoring through five.\n\nPick: Under 3.5 First Five Innings (+100)\n\nTEAM/PLAYER PROP\n\nSpeaking of Strasburg, his strikeout total sticks out like a sore thumb in this one. It\u2019s currently set at 6.5 with the Over set at a nice +105 and we just don\u2019t get it. We mentioned the right-hander has 33 punch-outs in just 22 postseason innings. That works out to 1.5 strikeouts per inning. And the only time he went Under this number in the playoffs was his relief appearance against the Brewers, were he had four in three innings. Meanwhile the Astros are striking out once every 3.9 plate appearances. As long as he doesn\u2019t get shelled early Strasburg should go Over this number.\n\nPick: Stephen Strasburg Over 6.5 Strikeouts (+105)\n\nFULL GAME TOTAL\n\nYou can expect Nationals manager Dave Martinez to ask a lot from Strasburg tonight. Max Scherzer could only get through a high-intensity five innings and had to not only use all the best relievers in his bullpen, but starter Patrick Corbin for an inning as well. So, things could be a little shaky if he needs to go to then for an extended length of time.\n\nOn the other side, the Astros have a respectable 3.86 bullpen this postseason, but that if it wasn\u2019t for Roberto Osuna, that number would be much worse. The Astros\u2019 closer had retired 13 straight batters the ninth inning of Game 6 in the ALCS. Houston also used their two other best relievers last night.\n\nThis number is just a little low with the bullpen usage and the home run ability up-and-down each lineup.\n\nPick: Over 7\n\nFULL GAME SIDE\n\nGame 2 presents the same situation as Game 1 did. With the starting pitchers on the mound this game should be a coin flip. But that\u2019s not what the odds are saying. With the perceived edge of the Astros lineup and home field advantage (almost worthless in baseball) we\u2019ve got a line where all the value is with the Nationals. It doesn\u2019t matter how you break it down, Strasburg vs. Verlander is a toss up and the Nationals are clearly hitting better than the Astros at this point. Take the value with the underdog in Game 2.\n\nPick: Nationals +155", "description": "From the opening pitch to the final out, we break down the best ways to wager the odds for Game 2 of the World Series.
