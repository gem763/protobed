The plot follows the twins\u2019 attempts to break up their father and fianc\u00e9e Blake so he will get back together with their mother, played by the late Natasha Richardson.\n\nHallie and Annie push Blake into all sorts of chaos, going so far as to set her adrift on a lake while sleeping at one point. It\u2019s great fun ... for everyone but her.\n\nAt any rate, it\u2019s lovely that after more than 20 years, Hendrix still has a sense of humor about that role. And it seems this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s flashed back to her \u201cParent Trap\u201d days.\n\nIn response to a meme in 2018 that read \u201ckids today will never know how much we hated this woman\u201d alongside many images of Hendrix as Blake, she quote-tweeted a snarky line from the movie: \u201cI will ship every one of you brats off to Switzerland.\u201d\n\nAh, Elaine. Never stop tweeting.", "description": "We can't stop laughing at this snarky \u2015 and perfectly Meredith Blake \u2015 response to her former co-star's engagement.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dae3a02200000571c506591.png?cache=cwkgxa6r5e&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
