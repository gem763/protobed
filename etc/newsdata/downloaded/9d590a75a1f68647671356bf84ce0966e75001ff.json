On the home front, the controversial move has been met with criticism on both sides of the political aisle, but the reaction in Moscow was far from mixed. As Trump uncorked chaos in the Middle East, champagne tops were likely popping at the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cPutin won the lottery! Russia\u2019s unexpected triumph in the Middle East,\u201d raved Mikhail Rostovsky in his article for the Russian newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets. \u201cThose who were convinced of Trump\u2019s uselessness for Russia ought to think again...What Washington got out of this strange move is completely unclear. To the contrary, what Moscow gained from this is self-evident...Trump\u2019s mistake in Syria is the unexpected \u2018lottery win\u2019 that further strengthened Moscow\u2019s position in the Middle East and undermined America\u2019s prestige as a rational political player and a reliable partner.\u201d\n\nMaksim Yusin, the editor of international politics at the leading Russian business daily Kommersant, was amazed by the ongoing stream of inexplicable actions by the American president that benefit the Kremlin. \u201cAll of this benefits the Russian Federation,\u201d Yusin marveled. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been watching Trump\u2019s behavior lately and get seditious thoughts: maybe he really is a Russian agent? He is laboring so hard to strengthen the international image of Russia in general\u2014and Putin in particular...In this situation, Americans\u2014to their chagrin and our enjoyment\u2014are the only losers in this situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is such a pleasure,\u201d grinned Olga Skabeeva, the host of Russia\u2019s state television program 60 Minutes. \u201cRussian soldiers have taken an American base under our complete control, without a fight!\u201d Skabeeva\u2019s co-host Evgeny Popov added: \u201cSuddenly, we have defeated everyone.\u201d Incredulously, Skabeeva pointed out: \u201cThis is an American base\u2014and they just ran away! Trump ran away!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since America has been humiliated this way,\u201d gloated political analyst Mikhail Sinelnikov-Orishak, \u201cThey ran away in shame! I can\u2019t recall such a scenario since Vietnam.\u201d He added: \u201cFor us, this is of great interest, because this is a key region where energy prices are being determined. That is a shining cherry on top.\u201d Political scientist Andrey Nikulin concurred: \u201cThis is sad for America. A smaller-scale version of what happened in Vietnam.\u201d\n\nAppearing on the nightly television show The Evening with Vladimir Soloviev, political analyst Evgeny Satanovsky recounted many ways in which Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria and abandon the Kurds has hurt the image and standing of the United States: \u201cAmerica betrayed everyone...Trump also strengthened the anti-American mood in Turkey, when he promised to destroy the Turkish economy.\u201d Satanovsky opined that now any economic problems or currency fluctuations in Turkey can be blamed directly on the United States, prompting textile, tobacco, steel and other industries to turn away from America. \u201cAnti-Americanism in Turkey is off the charts,\u201d Satanovsky pointed out, \u201cAmerican politics are tangled in their own shoelaces... America is successfully self-eliminating from the region.\u201d\n\n\u201c You know, I\u2019ve been watching Trump\u2019s behavior lately and get seditious thoughts: maybe he really is a Russian agent? \u201d \u2014 Maksim Yusin, the editor of international politics at the Russian business daily Kommersant,\n\nThe timing also struck the Russians as incredibly fortuitous and inexplicable. \u201cThey lost their only chance to remove [Syrian President] Bashar Assad,\u201d exclaimed Russian lawmaker Oleg Morozov, appearing on 60 Minutes, \u201cThey were only half a step away!\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s primitive letter to the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan also delighted the Russians. Olga Skabeeva, the host of Russia\u2019s 60 Minutes, sarcastically pointed out that President Trump seems to be unfamiliar with even the most basic manners: \u201cWe should send a message to the American president: \u2018Don\u2019t call people names. Don\u2019t fight. Don\u2019t pick your nose. It\u2019s nasty and unacceptable.\u2019\u201d Host Evgeny Popov said that the Turkish president threw Trump\u2019s letter in the trash and remarked: \u201cBut who wouldn\u2019t? The only thing missing was for Trump to call Erdo\u011fan \u2018dude.\u2019\u201d For his part, President Erdo\u011fan said he \u201ccannot forget\u201d the letter in question and ominously promised that Turkey would \u201cdo what\u2019s necessary\u201d concerning the letter \u201cwhen the time comes.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the exchanges between President Trump and President Erdo\u011fan, Leonid Kalashnikov, Chairman of Russian State Duma Committee for the Commonwealth of Independent States affairs, commented: \u201cI don\u2019t care that those two clowns write such letters to each other. You can only pity them. Is it better for us that the Americans left Syria? Of course it is! Will we make deals with Erdo\u011fan? Of course we will.\u201d\n\nPundits all over the Russian state media pondered out loud about the merits of Trump\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201cinfinite wisdom\u201d of pulling the U.S. forces out of northern and eastern Syria, concluding that the decision was an enormous blow to America\u2019s standing, undermining its current and potential alliances. On the other hand, Turkey is delighted with the outcome. Vice President Mike Pence gave Erdo\u011fan everything the Turkish side has been attempting to achieve, in exchange for a promised five-day pause in the offensive. A Turkish official told Middle East Eye, \u201cWe got exactly what we wanted out of the meeting.\u201d At the conclusion of the five-day pause, Erdo\u011fan will be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi.\n\nAppearing on 60 Minutes, Franz Klintsevich, a member of the Federation Council's Committee on Defense and Security, declared that Russia will take full advantage of America\u2019s withdrawal from the Middle East, becoming a top player in the region. Klintsevich argued that America\u2019s withdrawal from Syria represented Russia\u2019s \u201cglobal victory\u201d and \u201cdemonstrated the absolute superiority of Russia\u2019s arms, diplomacy and foreign policy.\u201d\n\nDuring the same show, political analyst Mikhail Sinelnikov-Orishak was overcome with gratitude: \u201cI look at Trump and think: \u2018May God grant him good health\u2014and another term. This is a great situation for Russia...We can practically sit back and reap the dividends from what others are doing...Meanwhile, Trump is yet to make a single good deal, which is why I wish him good health, may he flourish and get re-elected...Trump is a great candidate. I applaud him...For America, this isn\u2019t a very good president.\u201d\n\nTo the contrary\u2014for Russia, Trump\u2019s presidency is a gift that keeps on giving. The Kremlin\u2019s propagandists see no acceptable alternative to Trump amongst any viable presidential candidates in the United States. Complaining about prevailing anti-Russian attitudes, Vladimir Soloviev\u2014host of the nightly television show The Evening with Vladimir Soloviev\u2014sarcastically surmised: \u201cSo it looks like we\u2019ll have to elect your president\u2014again.\u201d", "description": "For Russia, Trump\u2019s presidency is a gift that keeps on giving.
