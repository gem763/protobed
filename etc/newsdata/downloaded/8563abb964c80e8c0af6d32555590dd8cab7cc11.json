REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey asked the United States to lift trade barriers between the two countries during talks on Saturday aimed at sharply increasing bilateral commerce, Turkey\u2019s trade minister said.\n\nWashington and Ankara have set an ambitious goal of quadrupling their trade to $100 billion a year, despite the prospect of U.S. sanctions over Turkey\u2019s recent purchase of Russian missile defence systems.\n\nTrade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan said she expressed Turkey\u2019s \u201cclear expectation\u201d to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross over the removal of \u201ccertain barriers and policies as implemented by the U.S. administration that constitute (an) obstacle to enhancing our bilateral trade.\u201d\n\nThe White House said in May it was ending a preferential trade agreement with Turkey, saying Turkey\u2019s level of economic development meant it was no longer eligible for the support.\n\nTurkey could also face sanctions from its NATO ally over the delivery in July of Russian S-400 missile defence equipment.\n\nPekcan said she discussed increasing Turkish exports in the civil aviation, automotive, jewellery, furniture, textiles and clothing sectors.\n\nThe U.S. embassy said Ross and Pekcan had agreed that raising trade to $100 billion would require hard work on both sides. The United States says trade with Turkey totalled $24 billion in 2017, with the U.S. surplus standing at $1.5 billion.\n\nThe two ministers are due to hold further talks in Ankara next week.", "description": "Turkey asked the United States to lift trade barriers between the two countries during talks on Saturday aimed at sharply increasing bilateral commerce, Turkey's trade minister said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427278852&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860MF", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
