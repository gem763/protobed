Tears of joy and appreciation for each other. I love this man so much.\n\n'WHAT a journey!! Thank you all for your messages, your love and support. Thank you BBC for this opportunity.\n\n'When I started my Strictly journey my confidence was low. My belief in what I could achieve on the show was extremely low. The expectations on my humble body - beyond low.\n\n'What @Johannesradebe gave me was priceless. Confidence ,Belief, Love- and Laughter beyond words!\n\nLast dance: Catherine and Johannes became the fifth couple to be voted off Strictly Come Dancing (pictured with host Tess Daly)\n\n'This man is a gift to the world.

I did it for me.\n\n'I also did it for the hundreds of mum's out there who felt they\u2019d lost a little bit of themselves, the women out there who\u2019d become negative about their body.

She has been a light for me. Thank you for accepting me for who I am and for showing me joy every day.'\n\nThe 11 remaining celebrity couples took to the dance floor on Sunday to perform an array of live glittering ballroom and Latin routines for Halloween Week.\n\nMike Bushell, 53, and his partner Katya Jones, 30, were third from bottom on the leaderboard, after performing the Tango to Gwen Stefani's hit What You Waiting For, landing them a score of just 26.\n\nCatherine wrote: 'When I started my Strictly journey my confidence was low. My belief in what I could achieve on the show was extremely low'\n\nHowever, neither Mike nor Catherine were at the very bottom of the leaderboard this week: Chris Ramsey and Karen Hauer's Samba to the Backstreet Boys' Everybody (Backstreet\u2019s Back) earned them 23 points out of 40.\n\nAfter the judges\u2019 scores were combined with the results of the viewers\u2019 votes, it was Catherine and Mike who were left to face each other.\n\nFollowing their dances for survival, the judges gave their verdicts, with Craig Revel Horwood choosing to save Mike and Katya, as he explained: 'One couple for me really stepped it up a notch. The couple I\u2019d like to save is Mike and Katya.'\n\nMotsi Mabuse chose to save Catherine and Johannes, saying: 'I felt a strong performance, stronger body actions, stronger leg actions.'\n\nShe said: 'What @Johannesradebe gave me was priceless. Confidence ,Belief, Love- and Laughter beyond words! This man is a gift to the world'\n\nNext up was Bruno Tonioili, who said: 'It\u2019s hard because you\u2019ve both done very, very well, but purely based on tonight I have to save the couple that got me tingling a little bit more and I have to save Catherine and Johannes.'\n\nLeft with the deciding vote, head judge Shirley opined: 'Well, I thought both couples really stepped it up a notch and this is always the most difficult decision for me.\n\n'But based on a good focus, difficult content, with some really beautiful footwork in there with stronger technical skills for me, cleaner and polished. I\u2019m going to save Mike and Katya.'", "description": "The Coronation Street star, 36, was the latest contestant to be given the boot from the series and posted a photo of Johannes, 32, kissing her hand after their elimination.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/01/20262264-0-image-a-41_1572224603181.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
