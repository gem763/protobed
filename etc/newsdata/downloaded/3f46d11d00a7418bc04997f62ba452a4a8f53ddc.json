REUTERS/Katherine Taylor\n\nHuffman was the first parent to be sentenced in the college admissions scandal, but she's not the first celebrity to serve time at FCI Dublin.\n\nPatty Hearst, the granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst, served 21 months at FCI Dublin after partaking in a robbery with members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, who had kidnapped her months earlier, the Mercury News reported. She was released in 1979 after President Jimmy Carter commuted her 7-year sentence.\n\nSara Jane Moore, who attempted to assassinate President Gerald Ford in 1975, spent 32 years at the prison.\n\nHeidi Fleiss, known as the \"Hollywood Madam,\" served 20 months in FCI Dublin in the 1990s after police busted an upscale prostitution ring that served high-profile clients in Hollywood.\n\nAll in all, the low-security prison offers a variety of activities and a decent amount of freedom compared to other higher security institutions. But that doesn't mean Huffman's stay will be a cakewalk. She will, after all, be in with people who are serving much longer sentences, who may resent her 14-day stint.\n\n\"There are people who are going to fawn over her because of her celebrity status, and other women who can't stand her because they are doing serious time,\" Holli Coulman, a former federal inmate who advises female defendants on preparing for life in federal prison for Wall Street Prison Consultants, told the Mercury News.", "description": "Felicity Huffman is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution Dublin, a low-security, all-women facility in Northern California.", "authors": ["Kelly Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da772c1695b585fa44d8443?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
