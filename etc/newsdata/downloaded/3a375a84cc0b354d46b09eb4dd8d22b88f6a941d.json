Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Had a young black man with a history of saying racist things about white people shot and killed a white police officer in her own home, he likely would not have gotten hugs from a white judge, a hair rub from a white police officer in the courtroom and been granted a kind of absolution by the white cop's brother. Instead of being sentenced to 10 years, he would have likely been sent to prison for the rest of his life, if not to death row.\n\nIssac Bailey\n\nHis actions would probably have been used as yet more evidence in the long line of excuses made to ignore or downplay rampant racial disparities that have been with us since the American criminal justice system was created, used to drive home the racist idea that it's OK for police to brutalize or shoot black people because we are supposedly uniquely violent.\n\nThose were the thoughts rumbling through my mind as I watched 18-year-old Brandt Jean, the younger brother of Botham Jean, a man gunned down in his own apartment by white Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, forgive and wish well, then embrace Guyger after she was sentenced to prison.\n\nI get why others only felt inspiration, and were moved by such a selfless act. The faith that moved Brandt Jean to say those words is the faith that convinces me to hold onto the idea of redemption for all, even those who do dastardly things.\n\nIt's why I have argued against the death penalty, even for white supremacist Dylann Roof. It's why I remained in a mostly-white Evangelical church for nearly two decades despite my unease with fellow Christians who began embracing ugly racial views, because we must walk our faith, even during difficult, conflicted times. That's how I know why Brandt Jean's words moved so many people.\n\nRead More", "description": "The hug from Brandt Jean was genuine, but Isaac Bailey writes that the response, largely from white America, rubbed him the wrong way. Does it feel as though they've been granted another get-of-jail-free card to avoid any racial guilt or discomfort and to push off the responsibility of healing America's racial wounds onto black people?", "authors": ["Opinion Issac Bailey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191002195608-brandt-jean-hugs-amber-guyger-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
