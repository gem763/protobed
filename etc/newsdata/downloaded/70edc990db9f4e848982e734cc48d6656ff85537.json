About 425,000 homes had lost power, the government said on Sunday.\n\n\u2013 Hagibis was packing winds of 180 km per hour (112 mph) near its center and gusts of up to 252 kmph (156 mph), broadcaster NHK reported the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) as saying on Saturday.\n\n\u2013 The storm brought record-breaking rainfall to many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\n\u2013 The heavy rain caused Chikuma river in Nagano prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, to flood its banks. Some houses along the river were nearly fully submerged in water and at least one person was rescued from the roof of a house by helicopter, NHK said. Part of a road was swept away in flooding.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday expressed their heartfelt sympathies on the loss of precious lives in Typhoon Hagibis in Japan, according to the Foreign Office.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PM-President.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
