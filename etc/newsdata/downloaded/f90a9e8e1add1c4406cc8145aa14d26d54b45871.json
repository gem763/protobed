Until Trump, scholars assumed that holding the White House inoculated parties from conspiracism. They viewed conspiratorial thinking as a weapon of the weak, which couldn\u2019t seriously threaten the republic because its adherents wielded so little influence in government.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes today\u2019s GOP so unusual and so dangerous. Never before in modern American history has a political party been this paranoid and this powerful at the same time.\n\nIn their book, American Conspiracy Theories, which tracks paranoid thinking in U.S. politics from 1890 to 2010, the University of Miami political scientists Joseph Uscinski and Joseph Parent conclude that \u201cconspiracy theories are for losers.\u201d Such theories, they argue, are \u201cmost likely to issue from domestic groups who fail to achieve power, objectives or resources.\u201d This makes sense. The more dispossessed you feel, and the less you identify with the people running the government, the easier it is to imagine them hatching a shadowy plot to screw you. Studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s, for instance, found a \u201cwidespread belief, particularly in the African American and gay communities, that the AIDS epidemic was a deliberate conspiracy by government officials.\u201d At the time, many black people and gay people felt deeply alienated from the Reagan and Bush administrations. (Not to mention that the federal government had in fact spread disease among African Americans in the past.)\n\nAs people feel more empowered, however, their political paranoia tends to fade. \u201cLarge winning groups,\u201d note Uscinski and Parent, \u201cfeel less anxiety, more in control and less need for conspiracy theories.\u201d After their side wins the White House, partisans generally see fewer nefarious plots. Colin Dickey, who is writing a book about conspiracy theories, noted last year in The New Republic that after Barack Obama won the White House, the percentage of Democrats who told pollsters that 9/11 was an inside job fell by half. \u201cWhen a Republican occupies the White House, conspiracy theories swarm around Republicans and capitalists,\u201d Uscinski and Parent write. \u201cWhen it is a Democrat\u2019s turn, conspiracy theories dog Democrats and socialists.\u201d\n\nAdam Serwer: Trump\u2019s inner circle keeps violating the Stringer Bell rule\n\nYet in the Trump era, that\u2019s no longer true. While Democrats\u2019 susceptibility to conspiracy theories may have risen since Trump\u2019s election, the GOP\u2019s doesn\u2019t appear to have gone down. The percentage of Republicans who believe Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States, Dickey notes, has not fallen since Trump took office. \u201cToday,\u201d write the political scientists Russell Muirhead and Nancy L. Rosenblum in their 2019 book, A Lot of People Are Saying, \u201cconspiracism is not, as we might expect, the last resort of permanent political losers but the first resort of winners.\u201d", "description": "Normally, conspiratorial thinking is a weapon for the weak.
