More than that, we feel betrayed,\" the petition reads.\n\nTwo authors and I have decided we will not be participating in any events at the Toronto Public Library moving forward if they allow the Meghan Murphy event to take place in their facilities. We would appreciate if you would sign this letter in solidarity.<a href=\"https://t.co/aFEDqa0gj5\">https://t.co/aFEDqa0gj5</a> \u2014@WordsandGuitar\n\n\"Offering Murphy a platform means denying the resources and promise of safe and equitable space to trans communities.\"\n\nMurphy, a freelance writer who runs the website \"Feminist Current,\" has written that \"allowing men to identify as women\" endangers women and undermines women's rights.\n\nLibrary says it is obliged to 'protect free speech'\n\nMurphy has also said trans women should not be allowed in women's washrooms, writing that \"there is absolutely no reason why it is necessary to allow people to access washrooms based on their personality, feelings, or clothing choices, versus their sex.\"\n\nThe library, meanwhile, says it is aware that the event has caused \"anger and concern\" but maintains it has an obligation to protect free speech.\n\n\"We would also suggest that engaging in respectful civil discourse with people of opposing views may be a more productive strategy than abstaining from public library events,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"Libraries have always been committed to supporting vulnerable communities by welcoming and creating space for different perspectives rather than through censorship.\"\n\nThe organization also says it does not believe Murphy's talk, titled \"Gender Identity: What does It Mean for Society, the Law and Women?,\" violates its rental policy.\n\nThe policy says the library can cancel any third-party event that would promote \"discrimination, contempt or hatred for any group or person on the basis of race, ethnic origin, place of origin, citizenship, colour, ancestry, language, creed, age, sex, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, membership in a union or staff association, receipt of public assistance, level of literacy or any other similar factor.\"\n\nSimilar controversy in Vancouver\n\nThe petition says it is \"hard to believe\" Murphy's talk will not have the effect of promoting discrimination against trans people.\n\n\"Those who want to disseminate hate speech today know that they can misrepresent, then weaponize the phrase 'freedom of speech' in order to get what they want: an audience, and space to speak to and then mobilize that audience against marginalized communities,\" the site says.\n\n\"There is a difference between denying free speech and what is known as deplatforming, which is when you refuse to allow hate speech to be disseminated in your facility.\"\n\nThe Vancouver Public Library faced similar backlash in January when it allowed Murphy to speak at one of its locations. The library was later banned from participating in that city's Pride events, with organizers citing the decision to greenlight Murphy's event.", "description": "A group of Ontario writers say they will no longer participate in events at the Toronto Public Library unless a controversial speaker set to appear at a library branch at the end of the month is cut loose.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323122.1571250267!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/reference-library.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
