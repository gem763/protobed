(John Raoux/AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Barack Obama appeared to lob a thinly veiled jab at his replacement in the White House at a technology event here Wednesday, marking a rare public rebuke from the former president.\n\nSpeaking at a private event hosted by data company Splunk, Obama explained how he had approached the job, including some 3,000 political appointments, before offering this advice: \u201cThe other thing that is helpful is not watching TV or reading social media.\"\n\n\u201cThose are two things I would advise, if you're our president, not to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates a lot of noise and clouds your judgment.\u201d\n\n[Barack Obama shares op-ed criticizing President Trump\u2019s \u2018poisoning of our democracy.\u2019]\n\nPresident Trump is, of course, frequently on Twitter and has been known to watch hours of cable news daily. In the roughly one-hour fireside chat, Obama never directly referred to Trump or his administration.\n\nBut that comment, along with another highlighting that the Obama administration avoided any indictments, seemed tailored to the largely liberal San Francisco audience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact we didn\u2019t have indictments,\u201d during his two terms in office, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve said that before, but that is pretty rare in modern day.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with a Russian ambassador \u2014 related to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of tax- and bank-fraud charges.\n\nObama has seldom weighed in on current politics since leaving office in 2017. Former presidents typically refrain from criticizing successors out of tradition, even if they are from different political parties.\n\nThis summer, Obama shared in a tweet a link to an op-ed that criticized Trump for comments he had made regarding four congresswomen of color, seeming to endorse it.\n\n[Trump accuses Fox News of \u2018heavily promoting the Democrats,\u2019 urges followers to look for another news outlet]\n\nOn Wednesday, Obama cautioned against what he called \u201copinion wrapped up as fact.\u201d\n\nToo much focus on polls or \u201cthe intensity of the passion of a very small subset of people,\u201d he said, \u201cwill sway your decision-making in an unhealthy way.\"\n\nThe former president singled out climate change, political divisions globally and income inequality as three major issues that could cause significant problems if they\u2019re not addressed properly.\n\nObama otherwise largely steered clear of any commentary on Washington. He spoke at length about parenting, noting he had \u201cwept\u201d after dropping off his daughters at college.", "description": "Former president Barack Obama appeared to lob a thinly veiled jab at President Trump during a technology event in San Francisco on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Greg Bensinger", "Reporter Covering Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9RVm98x8rfBU4wkLBJpR-CMY298=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4Q2GVGLIUI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
