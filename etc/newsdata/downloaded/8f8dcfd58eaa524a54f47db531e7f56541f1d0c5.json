So long had the buildup been \u2013 and so heated the warnings \u2013 that those who fled the opening salvos of Turkey\u2019s offensive in Kurdish northern Syria did so with little panic.\n\nOn tractors, horses, in cars and on motorbikes, the region\u2019s newest refugees made their way from the border town that had been long pinpointed as the starting point of a Turkish invasion.\n\nTurkish jets took off from runways just to the north, sending missiles streaking through the sky and into one of the town\u2019s few high-rise buildings. By sunset, around 15 shells had landed in Ras al-Ayn, according to local official, Hevin Darwiche.\n\nAs night drew near, new fears began to mount; might darkness bring a ground offensive that would send proxy forces trained by Ankara to retake the predominantly Arab town from the Kurds?\n\nPlay Video 0:35 Explosions hit Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn on Turkish border \u2013 video\n\nSuch are the contradictions of the Turkish operation: Kurdish forces that only months ago were fighting alongside the US military against Isis were now about to be attacked with the US president\u2019s explicit permission. Furthermore, many of Turkey\u2019s Arab proxy forces were former US allies several years ago, raised to fight the Syrian regime before Washington lost interest.\n\nNearby, French forces garrisoned close to the border also began to leave the area, according to local reports and regional diplomats. Their raison d\u2019etre had been to defeat the Islamic Stateterror group, the remnants of which remain detained in four camps \u2013 two of which were volatile and tense ahead of the Turkish push.\n\nIsis has been contained but, as European diplomats warned this week, continues to pose a lethal threat to global security.\n\nWhat is the situation in north-eastern Syria?

Without any of their friends standing in the way of the Turks, the Kurds would have to do the fighting for themselves. And that\u2019s what Kurdish forces vowed to do, as sporadic shelling continued into the evening.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Civilians flee with their belongings.

All indications and field information, including the military buildup on the Turkish side of the border indicate that our border areas will be attacked by Turkey in cooperation with the Syrian opposition tied to Turkey.\n\n\u201cThis attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians because our border areas are overcrowded.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the invasion on local communities is likely to send tens of thousands of people towards the Iraqi border, officials in Iraqi Kurdistan said. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried about it,\u201d one official said. \u201cOf course we\u2019d need to take care of them.\u201d\n\nBetween Ras al-Ayn, and the town of Ain Issa \u2013 which was also bombed by Turkish jets \u2013 a local driver said the number of new exiles had started to grow by the evening, adding: \u201cThere are groups fleeing using whatever they find. People are scared of the artillery hitting hear the town.\u201d\n\nWhat will happen next is the subject of much speculation across the province, with the shifting global allegiances proving difficult to digest.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish soldiers with armoured vehicles during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern Syria. Photograph: STR/EPA\n\nThe Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, tweeted to say he had asked the Kurds to start direct discussions with the Syrian government \u2013 a plan that is also seen locally as perhaps the only remaining buffer against the invading Turks.\n\nThe SDF said it welcomed Lavrov\u2019s announcement. Privately, the Syrian Kurdish leadership has long harboured fears about the cost of a rapprochement with Damascus, which it has neither opposed nor supported during the eight-year civil war.\n\nIn Qamishli, the regional capital of the Kurdish province, which was hit by two shells in the afternoon barrage, the return of the Assad \u201cregime\u201d has been seen as inevitable in many quarters.\n\nIn fact, the Syrian military has not left the town during the war \u2013 continuing to man checkpoints in two neighbourhoods and the road to the city\u2019s airport.\n\nSeveral hours west, on the Iraqi side of the border, a Peshmerga guard pointed at nearby farmland, which he said had been attacked by the Turkish airforce during the night. \u201cThey were hitting the PKK, he said. \u201cThey might be difficult friends, but they\u2019re still Kurds. We\u2019re seeing a lot more people leaving the border than arriving. And we\u2019re expecting many more.\u201d", "description": "People in Kurdish northern Syria begin fleeing opening salvos of attack as fears of ground offensive mount", "authors": ["Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6435e0aaf1ff2b3f262bfc6e8da0600d7a6c977/0_354_4224_2534/master/4224.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ef2e407186dd69fac4e55588cb2832a5", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
