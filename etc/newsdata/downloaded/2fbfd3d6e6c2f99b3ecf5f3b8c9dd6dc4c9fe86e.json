The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.\n\n\"Do you still believe in the company?\" Neumann, who had stepped down as CEO but was still WeWork's chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPN.N> bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on Oct. 6, the sources said.\n\nThe JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management CEO Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.\n\nWith questions swirling around WeWork's chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.\n\nA few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork's largest shareholder, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp <9984.T>.\n\nBoth were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.\n\nThis account of how WeWork's financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.\n\nWeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.\n\nRequests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.\n\n\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROBLEM\n\nSoftBank offered $9.5 billion to WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.\n\nIn addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company's \"corporate governance problem\" - Neumann's controlling grip.\n\nSoftBank's deal would strip Neumann's voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China's Hony Capital, for the company's precipitous decline, some of the people said.\n\nHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork's lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.\n\nThe problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as CEO on Sept. 24 because, as WeWork's founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.\n\nIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLAURE AND NEUMANN NEGOTIATE\n\nIn meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann's personal borrowings made against WeWork's stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970 million of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.\n\nSoftBank's latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9 billion based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.\n\nNeumann's special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million \"consulting fee\" in return for stepping down from WeWork's board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.\n\nWeWork's special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann's bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank's tender offer, some of the people said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Just a few months ago, WeWork's co-founder Adam Neumann was being courted by Wall Street's top investment bankers in anticipation of one of this year's most high-profile initial public offerings.
