The pound gdpusd briefly jumped to a session high of $1.2839, which would make for its best level since June, after RTE reported that Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party was accepting the so-called consent element of the revised Brexit agreement, seen as the last big obstacle to a deal. The U.K. has said it's open to some flexibility on the mechanism that would allow Northern Ireland politicians to decide whether it remains in regulatory alignment with the European Union as set out in Britain's latest Brexit deal proposals. The pound has since fallen back after the DUP's leader Arlene Foster reportedly denied the report and said talks will continue. Markets have been on a knife-edge in the runup to a two-day European Union meeting that starts Thursday, seen as a deadline for a deal to get done. The pound has since drifted back to $1.2783.", "description": "The British pound was sent on a rollercoaster ride Wednesday, spiking briefly against the U.S. dollar on a report that a big obstacle to a Brexit deal has...", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
