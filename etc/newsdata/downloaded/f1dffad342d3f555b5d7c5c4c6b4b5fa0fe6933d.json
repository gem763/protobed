Their desire to get the game on and resilience is to be absolutely applauded.\"\n\nWorld Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont also paid tribute to the organizing committee and offered his sympathies to those affected by a typhoon, which has cost at least 66 lives.\n\n\"In many ways, Japan\u2019s victory over Scotland was for a nation, not just rugby,\" he said. \"It reflected the wonderful human warmth and family spirit that has characterized this Rugby World Cup. The Japanese people are the heartbeat of the tournament and have welcomed the teams and fans with open arms. From full and vibrant stadiums and fan zones, to record social media, the fans, teams and the people of Japan have shared truly unforgettable moments of friendship, celebration and hospitality.\"\n\nThree matches on the final weekend of the pool did fall victim to the weather and Japan Rugby Chief Executive Akira Shimazu said that was a matter of regret.\n\n\"It gave us a lot of sadness and we would like to sincerely apologize for that,\" he said.\n\nWorld Rugby said Asia's first World Cup continued to break records with 1.8 million tickets sold - 99% of those available - 863,000 people crowding into fan zones and 200,000 Japan team replica shirts sold.\n\nChief Executive Brett Gosper said the Japan television audience for Sunday's match was tracking to exceed the 50 million mark - a first for a rugby game.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "The Scottish Rugby Union have been referred to a disputes committee over their comments about the potential cancellation of their World Cup clash against Japan, organizers said on Tuesday.
