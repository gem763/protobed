His signature is from his will in which he bequeathed his work to the nation.\n\nOthers features include:\n\nA large see-through window, based on the shape of the fountains in London's Trafalgar Square, with a blue and gold foil on the front depicting Margate lighthouse and the Turner Contemporary gallery in the town\n\nA smaller see-through window in the bottom corner of the note inspired by Tintern Abbey\n\nA metallic hologram which changes between the words \"Twenty\" and \"Pounds\" when tilted\n\nThe Queen's portrait in the see-through window with \"\u00a320 Bank of England\" printed twice around the edge\n\nA silver foil patch with the 3D image of the coronation crown\n\nA purple foil patch containing the letter T, based on the staircase at the Tate Britain gallery\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The security features are a crucial part of the new note\n\nBank of England governor Mark Carney said: \"As the new Turner \u00a320 testifies, money can be a work of art in everyone's pocket.\"\n\nThe note is replacing the current \u00a320 note featuring the economist Adam Smith. Of the five characters on banknotes by the end of 2021, other than the Queen only Jane Austen - who has appeared on the \u00a310 note since 2017 - is a woman.\n\nWhat is the note made of?\n\nThe new \u00a320 note will be the third Bank of England banknote to be made from polymer, following the new \u00a35 note and new \u00a310 note. The next version of the \u00a350 note, to be launched by the end of 2021, will also be polymer.\n\nThe theory is that the plastic notes will be more sturdy, such as surviving a spin in the washing machine, and be more resistant to counterfeiting.\n\nBanks in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man have issued plastic banknotes in the past.\n\nHow was Turner chosen as the face of the note?\n\nThe Bank received 29,701 nominations from the public after it announced it wanted to celebrate an artist on the note. Some 590 eligible visual artists were considered for the honour - about a fifth of whom are women.\n\nThe list was considered by a Bank committee, which included independent experts. It drew up a shortlist of five - Turner, filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, sculptor Barbara Hepworth, painter William Hogarth, and designer Josiah Wedgwood - from which the Bank's governor, Mr Carney, made the final choice of the English Romantic artist Joseph Mallord William Turner, or JMW Turner (1775 - 1851).\n\nHe is known as \"the painter of light\" and described by artist Tracey Emin as a \"wild maverick\". The unveiling was held at the Turner Contemporary in Margate, Kent. It was in the town that the London-born Turner, the son of a barber and wig maker, lived and more than 100 of his works were inspired by the East Kent coast.\n\nWho are on other banknotes?\n\nSir Winston Churchill appears on the Bank of England's polymer \u00a35 note.\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nJane Austen was chosen to appear on the plastic \u00a310 note after a campaign to represent women other than the Queen on English notes.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nComputer pioneer and codebreaker Alan Turing will feature on the new design of the Bank of England's \u00a350 note, to enter circulation by the end of 2021.\n\nImage copyright Bank of England\n\nA host of different people have appeared on banknotes issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
