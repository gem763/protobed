(AP) - Nikola Jokic had 20 points and 13 rebounds despite sitting much of the first half because of foul trouble, and the Denver Nuggets spoiled the opening game of Portland\u2019s 50th season with a 108-100 victory over the Trail Blazers on Wednesday night.\n\nWill Barton added 19 points for the Nuggets, who also snapped Portland\u2019s 18-game winning streak in home openers, the longest streak in league history.\n\nDamian Lillard led the Blazers with 32 points and eight assists, and Hassan Whiteside had 16 points and 19 rebounds in his Portland debut.\n\nWhiteside, acquired in an offseason trade with Miami, tipped in a Lillard 3-point attempt to help the Blazers to an 88-87 lead with just under five minutes left. But the Nuggets answered with consecutive baskets from Jokic and Gary Harris.\n\nJokic hit back-to-back 3-pointers to extend Denver\u2019s lead to 97-90. Lillard landed a 3-pointer with 1:58 left to narrow the gap but the Blazers couldn\u2019t catch up.\n\nIt was the first meeting between the teams since the Western Conference semifinals, won by the Blazers in seven games.\n\nThe Nuggets didn\u2019t make a lot of changes over the summer, returning the nucleus of the team that won 54 games last season and earned the West\u2019s second seed, ending a six-year postseason drought. The team\u2019s biggest move was acquiring Jerami Grant from Oklahoma City.\n\nPortland, meanwhile, has six new faces on the roster, including Whiteside, who started at center. The Blazers also picked up veteran big man Pau Gasol as they await Jusuf Nurkic\u2019s return from a broken leg.\n\nThe Blazers finished 53-29 last season and clinched the West\u2019s third seed, playing through to the conference finals for the first time in 19 years.\n\nJokic collected three early fouls and went to the bench with 8:15 left in the first quarter.\n\nRodney Hood hit a 3-pointer and made a free throw to give Portland a 19-7 lead. Lillard\u2019s first points of the game came on a dunk that made it 21-16.\n\nThe Blazers closed to 70-69 on Lillard\u2019s 3-pointer late in the third quarter and then tied it on Anfernee Simons\u2019 free throw. But they didn\u2019t regain the lead until Simons\u2019 driving layup made it 74-73 and capped a 16-6 run going in to the final period.\n\nCJ McCollum\u2019s 3-pointer pushed the lead to 79-73 and Portland held on until Jamal Murray\u2019s 3 made it 83-all. Jokic\u2019s jumper gave Denver back the lead before Whiteside\u2019s tip.\n\nMichael Porter Jr., the No. 14 draft pick in 2018 who sat out last season as he recovered from back surgery, did not play for the Nuggets.\n\nTIP INS\n\nNuggets: Former Oregon center Bol Bol, the son of Manute Bol, warmed up with the Nuggets. A second-round pick, he signed to a two-way contract with the team.\n\nTrail Blazers: Gasol, who is still rehabbing from foot surgery, did not play. \u2026 Lillard addressed the crowd before the game: \u201cRip City! Rip City! We would like to welcome you to our 50th season, and hopefully our best.\u201d \u2026 The previous record for longest winning streak in home openers was 14, held by Boston from 1979-92.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNuggets: Host the Phoenix Suns on Friday.\n\nTrail Blazers: Kick off a four-game road trip against the Sacramento Kings on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nikola Jokic had 20 points and 13 rebounds despite sitting much of the first half because of foul trouble, and the Denver Nuggets spoiled the opening game of Portland's 50th season with a 108-100 victory over the Trail Blazers on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
