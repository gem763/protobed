However, unlike the depleting fossil fuels, the leaf would provide a carbon-neutral solution.\n\nAccording to Chemist Erwin Reisner of the University of Cambridge, the flammable gas generated by this artificial leaf doesn't release any carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nHe says, \"You may not have heard of syngas itself, but every day you consume products that were created using it. Being able to produce it sustainably would be a critical step in closing the global carbon cycle and establishing a sustainable chemical and fuel industry.\"\n\nDon't Miss 132 SHARES 4.8 K SHARES 8.9 K SHARES 3.3 K SHARES\n\nThe team working on this artificial leaf has managed to make it sustainable with the help of the materials and catalyst that they've used.\n\nThe leaf consists of two light absorbers -- similar to the surface that stores sunlight and turns it into electricity -- these are made fusing a catalyst that is fabricated using cobalt.\n\nWhen the leaf is placed in water, one light absorber takes the help of the catalyst to produce oxygen, while the other conducts a chemical reaction that reduces carbon dioxide and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, thus creating the syngas mixture.\n\nWhat's more amazing is the fact that this leaf can even work during cloudy and overcast days without a drop in the overall performance.\n\nPaper author and chemist Virgil Andrei states, 'This means you are not limited to using this technology just in warm countries, or only operating the process during the summer months. You could use it from dawn until dusk, anywhere in the world.\"\n\nUniversity of Cambridge\n\nHe further added, \"'We are aiming at sustainably creating products such as ethanol, which can readily be used as a fuel. It's challenging to produce it in one step, from sunlight, using the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. But we are confident that we are going in the right direction, and that we have the right catalysts, so we believe we will be able to produce a device that can demonstrate this process in the near future.\"\n\nThe researchers are also working on creating liquid fuel directly using carbon dioxide and water instead of producing syngas first and then turning it into fuel.", "description": "Scientists at the University of Cambridge have created an artificial leaf that would help generate flammable gas by gathering energy from sunlight using photosynthesis, just like an actual leaf.
