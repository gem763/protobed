Deep State. Shameful!\"\n\nTrump also spoke with Giuliani over the phone before their lunch, the Times reported, citing two unidentified sources. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.\n\nTrump and Giuliani are facing mounting scrutiny over their efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden Joe BidenGiuliani says he is unaware of reported federal investigation Trump says Giuliani is still his lawyer Sondland to tell Congress 'no quid pro quo' from Trump: report MORE and his son over unfounded allegations of corruption. A whistleblower complaint focused on their interactions with Ukraine is at the heart of House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe Times reported on Friday that prosecutors were looking into Giuliani's efforts to undercut the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her post in May as Trump looked to pressure Ukraine into investigating a top political opponent.\n\nThe probe is reportedly linked to a case against two of Giuliani's associates who were arrested last week. Two Ukraine-born businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested last week and charged with sending illegal contributions to a congressman who they hoped would help remove Yovanovitch.\n\nGiuliani has acknowledged working with Parnas and Fruman to find dirt on the Biden family. But he has dismissed allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nHe said Saturday on CNN that he has received no indications that his dealings in Ukraine are under federal investigation. Giuliani also questioned why the investigation had been leaked to the Times, saying \"if it's an appropriate law enforcement investigation, you try to keep it secret so the subjects aren't alerted.\"\n\n\"Nothing but leaks, which has to tell you whether they are or are not investigating, it's a political attack. Otherwise, why leak it?\" he asked.\n\nTrump also confirmed Saturday evening that Giuliani remains a member of his legal team.", "description": "President Trump met with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, for lunch at his Virginia golf course on Saturday as the former New York mayor faces scrutiny over his dealings with Ukraine,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonaldlouisianarally4_101119screenshot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
