But this week has revealed two specific incidents suggesting that the president\u2019s grip on this group of conservative Christians might not be as airtight as we thought.\n\nRecent polling suggests that support for the impeachment inquiry to determine if President Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors in his conversations with the president of the Ukraine is high enough, even among his core supporters, to cause the White House some real concern. Given the president\u2019s consistent low approval with a majority of Americans, any indication that he is losing support among his base could be detrimental to his reelection plans.\n\nAccording to a Fox News poll released Wednesday, 51 percent of Americans want Trump impeached and removed from office \u2014 including nearly 3 in 10 white evangelicals. The poll shows that fewer than 70 percent of white evangelicals want Trump in office. Support for Trump among this group of voters has been largely unmovable through ethics scandals, to include paying off women with whom the president allegedly had affairs, and such policies as the administration\u2019s reductions in refugee admissions, notably those fleeing religious persecution. But the number of evangelicals who want Trump to exit the Oval Office due to concerns about his ethics is not insignificant.\n\nThe majority of white evangelicals \u2014 71 percent \u2014 continue to support Trump, according to the poll, but that\u2019s 10 points lower than the 81 percent that backed him over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAlan Noble, editor of Christ and Pop Culture, a magazine covering Christian culture, said it is possible that some evangelical supporters of Trump are exhausted by the daily grind of this presidency and would welcome an off-ramp.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that there have always been a nontrivial number of uncomfortable Trump supporters \u2014 evangelicals who tend to feel exhausted by politics and who held their nose to vote for Trump in 2016,\u201d he told The Fix. \u201cEvangelicals who love Trump\u2019s [Supreme Court] appointments but cringe at his rhetoric. For people in that space, they might just need a serious enough event to push them from indifferent and begrudging support for Trump to private support for impeachment.\u201d\n\nOther white evangelicals \u2014 including some of the president\u2019s most vocal supporters \u2014 have taken to airing their disapproval of Trump\u2019s most recent foreign policy solution: abandoning the United States\u2019 Kurdish allies in Syria.\n\nPat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, took to his television program to criticize Trump\u2019s move as going against Scripture.\n\n\u201cI believe . . . the president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen,\u201d Robertson said during the Monday episode of his CBN show, \u201cThe 700 Club.\u201d\n\nFranklin Graham, one of Trump\u2019s key advisers, took to social media to get Trump\u2019s attention \u2014 a method many close to the president have said is an effective way to influence him.\n\nTODAY I ask that you join me in praying for the lives affected by the White House decision to pull US troops out of northern Syria. Both Democrat & Republican leaders are deeply concerned bc this would be, in essence, abandoning our closest allies there\u2014the Kurdish people. 1/2 \u2014 Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cThe Kurds are the ones who have been leading the fight against ISIS in Syria,\u201d he tweeted, referring to the Islamic State militant group. \u201cAlso pray for the Christians who the Kurds have been protecting. They could be annihilated. Would you pray w/me that Pres. @realDonaldTrump will reconsider? Thousands of lives hang in the balance.\u201d\n\nThe reaction has surprised even some within evangelicalism, considering how supportive many within the group are of the president.\n\n\u201cSyria has been striking because the response has been overwhelmingly negative,\u201d Noble, a professor at Oklahoma Baptist University, told The Fix. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of an action by this administration that has almost no support at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Turkey continues their invasion and citizens \u2014 especially Christians \u2014 continue to be killed, I would not be surprised to see even more white evangelicals sour on the president,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s a long time \u2014 13 months \u2014 until Trump will need to call on that support for his reelection, and it\u2019s entirely possible that what we have seen this week will just be a blip. But this week has to have people in his camp on their toes.", "description": "Few groups stand behind Trump more faithfully than white evangelicals \u2014 but that could be changing.", "authors": ["Eugene Scott", "Reporter Covering Identity Politics For The Fix", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MibwzjaSbJ-SQl_qISpLZMG8SH4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GMRF5YUDZEI6RHQGJW2SVRBOAU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
