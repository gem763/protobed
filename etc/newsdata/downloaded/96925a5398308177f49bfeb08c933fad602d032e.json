Kevin Clifton has stepped in to partner Alex in tonight\u2019s show.\u2019\n\nStrictly showed the moment Will was left in agony (Picture: BBC)\n\nWill, a 31-year-old table tennis player who won gold at the Rio 2016 Paralympics, was born with arthrogryposis \u2013 a condition which causes curved joints affecting all four of his limbs.\n\nHe was later diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, aged seven, and was treated at Great Ormond Street Children\u2019s hospital who helped him through rehabilitation.\n\nSpeaking about dancing with the condition, Will revealed how partner Janette doesn\u2019t hold back on the criticism despite the extra hurdle.\n\n\u2018I thought she might be soft on me because of my difficulties, but she tells me straight, which is the best way,\u2019 Will told Closer magazine.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s adapted it really well for me.\n\nHi everyone, I am absolutely gutted I cannot be performing tonight on strictly with Janette, sadly I'm injured and not fit to dance. I hope to be back on the dance floor next week. Good luck to everyone tonight.

I thought I had broken my legs as I had never felt anything like it before. But luckily, it\u2019s not as severe as what I thought when I first did (it).\n\n\u2018To hear the words that I absolutely can\u2019t dance, it was just really gutting for me, but I need to recover now and come back even stronger next week.\u2019\n\nBoth Will and Alex have been middle of the leaderboard but have been improving week by week, and last week Alex was near the top after stunning the judges with her Charleston to Pump Up the Jam.\n\nThe pair, who scored a whopping 33 points for their Charleston, have also been romantically linked after both Neil and Alex recently ended long term relationships prior to the show beginning.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues Sunday night on BBC One.\n\nMORE: Strictly\u2019s Neil Jones pulls out of show leaving partner Alex Scott to perform with Kevin Clifton", "description": "Will Bayley and Janette Manrara have pulled out of Saturday's Strictly Come Dancing after the paralympian was left in agony during rehearsals.
