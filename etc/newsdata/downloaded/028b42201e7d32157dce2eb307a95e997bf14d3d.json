According to CoinMarketCap, the leading cryptocurrency has incurred another 4% loss of the past 24 hours, falling to under $8,000 for the first time in months.\n\nWhile this devastating drop was forecasted by analysts like Peter Brandt, this move caught most investors aback, as made abundantly clear by the $550 million in BitMEX long liquidations observed on Monday.\n\nWith Bitcoin entering a brief price lull right now, you may be wondering \u2014 what BTC price level should I be watching right now?\n\nDon\u2019t worry, NewsBTC has you covered.\n\nAll Eyes on $7,700 for Bitcoin\n\nTo get straight to the point, $7,700 is the most important price point for Bitcoin investors at the moment. Around this level \u2014 which is nearly 50% below the $13,900 peak seen in June \u2014 sits a confluence of integral technical support levels.\n\nThese include but aren\u2019t limited to the 200-day moving average; the 365-day exponential moving average, a level that Bitcoin bounced straight off of during mid-2017; the 50-week exponential moving average, among other levels that many say are indicative of Bitcoin\u2019s medium-term trends.\n\n$BTC Update \u2013 Strong weekly support at 50EMA and 100MA\n\n\u2013 Closing below 7.7K, can cause a nasty dump to around 6.5K\n\n\u2013 As long as I see a good reaction at the current support channel, I am positive we are going up from here pic.twitter.com/LJqycVtE18 \u2014 CryptoBuzz\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb (@Crypto_Buzz_247) September 26, 2019\n\nAnalyst Crypto Buzz has stated that a loss of this level is likely to cause \u201cnasty dump to around $6,500\u201d, a level which many believe will act as the bottom of this bull market consolidation. $6,500 is, of course, where BTC famously traded around for months on end during the middle of 2018.\n\nCrypto Hamster has even gone as far as to say that a loss of $7,700 without a strong recovery may be a clear sign that the \u201cbull market is over\u201d. This, of course, might be the most dramatic of takes on the recent cryptocurrency price action.\n\nBut one thing is for certain: a loss of $7,700 may spell disaster for bulls at least for the next month or two.\n\nMacro Trend Positive\n\nSo sure, a further unwinding of the cryptocurrency market is likely on the table. However, it is important to note that Bitcoin is believed to still be in a macro bull trend, no matter what cynics and emotional investors may be spouting on Twitter.\n\nIn fact, Mark Yusko, the chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, recently took to CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money\u201d panel to only assert that Bitcoin isn\u2019t going anywhere. He remarked:\n\n\u201cLook, the daily price of Bitcoin doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s been alive for ten years. Save for one year, 2015, it has made a higher lower [each and every year]; BTC\u2019s market capitalization has grown every single year.\u201d\n\nThe implication here, of course, is that he expects for Bitcoin\u2019s rampant price appreciation trend to continue. Yusko went on to note that the fundamental metrics back this, citing continual growth in the number of transactions, hash rate, realized value, and more to prove Bitcoin is stronger than ever before.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "On Thursday, Bitcoin bears continued to ravage the cryptocurrency market.
