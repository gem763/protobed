One officer was struck in the chest but saved by his protective vest, according to authorities.\n\nPolice officers fired back at the suspected gunman, killing him outside the apartment complex on Savannah Terrace SE, near Suitland Parkway and Alabama Avenue, police said. The injured officer was treated for a bruise at a hospital and sent home, according to a department spokesman and his union representative.\n\nRenee Carter identified her 55-year-old brother, Alphonzo Carter, as the man fatally shot inside the bathroom of their mother\u2019s apartment. She identified her other brother, Eric Carter, 53, as the man shot and killed by police.\n\nA D.C. police spokesman confirmed the identities and said investigators at this point believe that Eric Carter killed Alphonzo Carter and then confronted officers who raced to the complex a few minutes after 7 p.m. Monday after a report of shots being fired.\n\nThe new details fill in some gaps from initial police accounts Monday night.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, Renee Carter did not question the decision by police to shoot Eric Carter and said she was relieved the wounded officer was not seriously injured. But she said relatives are upset that police delayed entering the apartment to assemble a tactical team, fearing a possible second shooter. Those heavily armed officers found the wounded Alphonzo Carter in a bathroom, where he was later pronounced dead.\n\n\n\nD.C. police said they recovered this pistol at the scene of a police-involved shooting Monday September 16, 2019 on Savannah Terrace SE. Police said they believe a man fatally shot his brother inside an apartment and then opened fire on police officers outside the building. (DC Police)\n\n[Officer injured in shooting outside Southeast Washington apartment]\n\n\u201cMy brother could have probably survived had they gone in and got him right away,\u201d said Renee Carter, who is 59 and lives in Washington. \u201cI have one brother who was shot because he shot the police. I know they are going to kill him. But what about the other brother who was an innocent bystander? He was left in the house bleeding.\u201d\n\nD.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham, speaking to reporters more than two hours after the first calls for help, said that \u201cafter the male came out and shot at our police officers, it was unclear if there was a second shooter.\u201d He said the tactical team was called in \u201cto ensure the scene was secure. When they did that they located another male inside the apartment suffering from gunshot wounds.\u201d\n\nNewsham told reporters at 9:30 p.m. that the wounded person was in critical condition. Police said a representative from the medical examiner\u2019s office later pronounced the man dead.\n\nPolice officials could not immediately say how much time elapsed from the initial shooting about 7 p.m. to when police found Alphonzo Carter in the bathroom.\n\nRenee Carter said her mother told police at some point that Alphonzo was alone in the apartment and had been injured.\n\nA police spokesman would not immediately comment beyond what the chief told reporters Monday night.\n\nAuthorities described a confusing scene when they arrived and said the first responding officers were immediately confronted outside the apartment building by a gunman who fired on them. Newsham said one or more officers returned fire, adding, \u201cIt sounds like the officer didn\u2019t have much choice.\u201d\n\nPolice released a photo of a Taurus .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun they said was found outside the apartment building. Authorities said officers who fired have been placed on leave, as is typical in such an investigation, and their body camera videos are being reviewed.\n\nStephen Bigelow Jr., the chairman of the union that represents District officers, said officers confronted a \u201cdifficult situation\u201d with \u201clots of unknowns.\u201d He added: \u201cWe just had an officer get shot. We\u2019re not going to send another group of officers who didn\u2019t have the proper protective gear in there.\u201d\n\nBigelow said the wounded officer, who officials did not identify, \u201cis doing good and is in good spirits.\u201d He said the bullet pierced his badge and struck his protective vest.\n\nRenee Carter said her brother Eric, a construction worker, had been prescribed opioid drugs years earlier after a vehicle accident that injured his spine, then developed a dependence. She said he had been in a residential treatment program and had left or signed out over the weekend, complaining that someone had stolen money from him.\n\nShe said that it appeared Eric had been making a steady recovery but that his girlfriend thought he had been acting out of sorts over the past few days.\n\nEric decided to stay overnight with their 76-year-old mother, Gloria Carter, and his brother, Alphonzo, who lived with her as a caretaker. Renee Carter said she did not know Eric had a weapon or how he obtained one.\n\nFor reasons that remain unexplained, Renee Carter said Eric kicked down the bathroom door and repeatedly shot Alphonzo. She said their mother ran to a neighbor\u2019s apartment, from where police were called.\n\nShe said her mother could hear the gunshots that killed one son and, moments later, the gunshots that killed her other son.\n\n\u201cWe have to get answers,\u201d said Renee Carter, now the last surviving sibling. \u201cThis is a tragedy.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018A failing of the systems\u2019: In rowhouse fire, D.C. missed many chances to save lives\n\nProsecutors in Prince George\u2019s will no longer recommend cash bail for defendants\n\nWith a letter of support from Kim Kardashian-West, D.C. man convicted of murder gets a second chance\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "One officer was shot but saved by his vest; police then shot and killed the gunman.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
