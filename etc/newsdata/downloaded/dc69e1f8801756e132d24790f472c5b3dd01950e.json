It was a clear-eyed prediction of a developing political schism that has driven American politics for decades and remains bitterly relevant today. For the GOP, becoming \u201cthe white man\u2019s party\u201d may have won it elections over the years, but, as White might have asked, \u201cAt what price?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat White saw \u2014 before the Watts and Detroit riots, before black power and affirmative action and the Boston busing crisis and Reagan Democrats \u2014 was an emerging and powerful \u201cbacklash\u201d by whites against racial integration that, he presciently warned, \u201cwill carry over, its snap growing in violence from 1964 to 1968 and all the elections beyond.\"\n\nHistorians and pundits looking for the roots of political realignment in the 1960s typically point to President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s prognosis after signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 that Democrats \u201chave lost the South for a generation.\u201d They then cite Richard Nixon\u2019s Southern strategy, which turned the formerly Democratic South into a Republican stronghold.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the South that White had in mind. It was the white working and middle classes in the North, who, as White described them, wore business suits and hard hats. They lived in suburban communities and urban ethnic enclaves and resented the growing pressure to integrate minority families into \u201cthe sense of kinship and neighborhood\u201d these whites so cherished. They were the foot soldiers of what would become \u201cthe white man\u2019s\u201d Republican Party that White dreaded and feared.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe news peg for White\u2019s article was an uprising of white middle-class parents in a Queens, New York, neighborhood \u2014 just miles from where Trump grew up \u2014 who fought a plan to integrate their local school. More than 8,000 whites picketed in protest, and 65 were arrested. Signs included \u201cKEEP OUR CHILDREN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL\u201d and \u201cTHIS IS NOT A GAME OF CHESS \u2014 DO NOT USE MY CHILD AS A PAWN.\"\n\nThe Queens unrest coincided with a larger white protest of New York City schools, led by a group calling itself the Parents and Taxpayers Association, which resisted integration plans and organized a systemwide boycott that kept a quarter-million kids home the first day of school.\n\nTo White, this boycott fit a pattern he saw in white communities throughout the North. But, he observed, it wasn\u2019t just resistance to school integration. White workers were worried about losing jobs to automation and relocation, so they pushed back against black workers who wanted to integrate shop floors. Housing, too, was a flash point, with states and communities \u2014 even \u201ca cultured university town like Berkeley, Calif.\u201d \u2014 resisting fair housing laws and voting out Democratic politicians who supported them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany of these Northern whites would protest that they weren\u2019t bigoted or prejudiced. \u201cIntegration is okay with me. I\u2019m for it,\u201d White quoted one white New Yorker, who then noted he would send his kids to private school instead of the public school they were slated to attend. As White observed, \u201cMen of earnest goodwill and men of spastic bigotry, alike, grope in moral confusion \u2014 trying to decide what they think of the Negro\u2019s revolution as it touches them.\"\n\nThese were white Americans who were satisfied and comfortable with the security and stability of their 1950s American Dream \u2014 and were wholly unprepared for the relentless changes hitting them in the 1960s. It was an America \u201cchanging almost too rapidly to describe,\u201d White wrote, and it created \u201cfears that beloved ways of life may be threatened in ways undefined, in a future over which individuals may have no control.\"\n\nThey started to craft their solution in all-white wards and local union halls that brought Republicans and racially conservative Democrats together, an alliance some historians have located as early as the 1940s and \u203250s. In Michigan, White noted, once-loyal Democratic voters \u201cin the all-white suburbs \u2014 fearful of Negro penetration \u2014 punished\u201d an incumbent governor who supported fair housing, helping elect a Republican in 1962.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis phenomenon then burst into national headlines when George Wallace, Alabama\u2019s segregationist governor, challenged President Johnson for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1964 and received 34 percent of the vote in the Wisconsin primary, 30 percent in Indiana and 43 percent in Maryland, largely from white middle- and working-class precincts. They voted for Wallace, White reported, \u201cjust to show the blankety-blanks.\"\n\nWallace, of course, would reiterate his message four years later, captivating these same voters in the North with broadsides against \u201cprofessors on college campuses \u2014 pseudo-intellectuals,\u201d against the press, against \u201cpointy-head\u201d and \u201ccontemptuous\u201d bureaucrats who tell \u201cthe little man\u201d how to live and give their hard-earned money away to those who \u201cdon\u2019t want to work.\"\n\nFor whites who felt their way of life slipping away or under siege, politicians such as Wallace left them feeling like someone cared and would listen to their concerns \u2014 unlike liberals, who, many whites felt, favored social engineering at their expense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Wallace ran his presidential campaigns as a Democrat or independent, it would be Republicans who would exploit this sentiment politically in the decades to come. Identifying that was the genius behind White\u2019s 1964 analysis: White understood that backlash politics would not die with Barry Goldwater\u2019s impending landslide defeat in the presidential election that year. In fact, the Democratic Party\u2019s growing association with civil rights could only intensify it and drive Northern whites into the welcoming arms of a Republican Party willing to exploit it.\n\nAnd beginning with Nixon, that\u2019s exactly what they did. Nixon inflamed the \u201csilent majority\u201d and \u201cforgotten Americans\u201d with coded language about race and \u201claw and order\u201d that played to their sense of grievance and victimization. Said Nixon, \u201cWhen young people apply for jobs \u2026 and find the door closed because they don\u2019t fit into some numerical quota, despite their ability, and they object, I do not think it is right to condemn those young people as insensitive or even racist.\"\n\nRonald Reagan would do the same with his appeals to \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d and his condemnation of \u201cwelfare queens.\u201d The white populist politics that Trump demagogues are therefore nothing new; he\u2019s simply more unvarnished and unfiltered in using them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhite understood earlier than most that race would cleave our politics and nation, that it would trigger a backlash against a liberalism aligned with civil rights. One can trace a direct line from what he described in October 1964 to Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral college victory and his ability to conjure up and exploit decades of racial resentment and brooding white anger.\n\nThe question ahead is whether this next generation will continue to live with the sins of the past \u2014 or finally put to rest the politics of backlash. Younger Republicans, are you listening?\n\nAD", "description": "The Republican choice that has shaped our modern political divides.", "authors": ["Leonard Steinhorn", "Leonard Steinhorn Is A Professor Of Communication", "Affiliate Professor Of History At American University", "A Political Analyst For Cbs News."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/t5M3kFCfmk8K_RdcZvd-5lgpzkw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QVFMHHFS24I6TLGIDWCHXLGKOM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
