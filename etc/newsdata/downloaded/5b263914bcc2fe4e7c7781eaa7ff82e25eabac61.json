I felt useless, and sensed the police were frustrated, but I was simply too shocked.\n\n\"For months afterwards I feared anyone walking close to me on the street, totally losing my trust.\n\n\"I am now the mother of three teenage boys living in south London, not far from the site of that attack. Knife crime is far worse, and lives are being lost on a frightening scale.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe added: \"The news of each latest stabbing - like the two 17-year-olds killed in Milton Keynes at the weekend - makes me fear for my boys whenever they step out of the door.\n\n\"And how is the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, spending his time? Well, over the weekend, as mums like me worried about letting their children out on the streets, he joined protesters in a march - to campaign for a second referendum on Brexit .\n\n\"I know Sadiq - he is a father himself, he lives near me and I believe in his heart he is concerned about knife crime.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"But I was deeply disappointed to see him distracted from what he claims is his top priority, keeping Londoners safe.\"\n\nReid called for a \"pincer movement\" to tackle crime and the causes of crime and said restoring police budgets must come first.", "description": "The Good Morning Britain presenter is concerned for her teenage sons growing up in London after she was attacked near her home", "authors": ["Laura Harding", "Vicki Newman", "Image", "Getty", "Bbc", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Itv", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16501988.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Susanna-Reid.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
