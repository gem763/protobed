I will no longer be shamed,\" said Virginia Roberts Giuffre in a statement following the Wednesday appearance in Manhattan federal court. \"I will see Alan Dershowitz in a court of law. But I am dismayed by the Court's decision, in this case, to deprive me of my counsel.\"\n\nDershowitz\u2019s attorney told FOX Business his client is \u201cpleased\u201d with Reska\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dershowitz will call David Boies and his colleagues at trial to prove that their client \u2014 in Boies' own words \u2014 is \u201cwrong \u2026 Simply wrong\u2019 in accusing him,\u201d Imran H. Ansari said. \u201cAlthough the Boies Firm have stated they will promptly appeal the decision, legally, that option may not be available to them. In any event, any attempt to appeal Judge Preska\u2019s decision regarding disqualification will be met with stiff opposition by Professor Dershowitz.\"\n\nGiuffre claimed in 2014 \u2013 and again in court papers this past April \u2013 she was forced into sex with Dershowitz and further alleged the legal expert witnessed Epstein\u2019s abuse of other women.\n\nShe later sued Dershowitz for defamation after he publicly denied ever even meeting Giuffre and called her a \"serial perjurer,\" a \"serial liar,\" and a \"serial prostitute\" in interviews with major media outlets.\n\nGiuffre's allegations drew newfound attention in July 2019 when Epstein \u2013 who was reportedly worth more than $550 million \u2013 was indicted on charges related to sex trafficking of minors.\n\nThe financier was found unconscious on the morning of Aug. 10, in his jail cell at lower Manhattan\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center. The New York City medical examiner determined Epstein had committed suicide by hanging.\n\nDershowitz had asked Senior United States District Judge Loretta A. Preska to toss the case at the end of September, and also requested that she disqualify Giuffre\u2019s attorney, David Boies, and the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP.\n\nThe latter request was made after Dershowitz claimed he allegedly secretly recorded David Boies, a prominent attorney with the firm, casting doubt on the veracity of Giuffre's claims. Boies has said the call was recorded without his consent and that Dershowitz has mischaracterized their conversation.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nOn Wednesday, Preska granted his request for Giuffre to find new legal representation.\n\n\u201c[Giuffre\u2019s] attorneys must be independent and free to challenge the credibility of Boies and other [law firm] partners in order to test the allegations made in the complaint.\u201d\n\nDershowitz told The Associated Press during a Wednesday phone call the decision gives his legal team the green light \u201cto put David Boies at the center of this conspiracy.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"We're going to prove that my accuser had repeatedly told people that she did not have sex with me until she met her lawyers.
