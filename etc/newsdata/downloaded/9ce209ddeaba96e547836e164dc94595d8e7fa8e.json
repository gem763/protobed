Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., makes an objection to a Republican argument as the House Oversight and Reform Committee considers whether to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to turn over subpoenaed documents related to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, June 12, 2019. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nI\u2019ve had a theory that on a long enough timeline, every person who embraces social justice becomes so pathologically enslaved to the ideology of critical theory that it greatly warps their perception of reality.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave a perfect example of this during a recent House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties with a focus on fracking and fossil fuels. The New York socialist seems to only see everything through a lens of race and class, and because of this, went so far as to blame the death of her grandfather on white people.\n\nIf he had died as a result of a white person murdering him, then Ocasio-Cortez may have had at least some semblance of an argument that still would have died after the first counter-point. People are killed every day for all sorts of reasons and by all kinds of races.\n\nBut no. AOC\u2019s grandfather died due to Hurricane Maria, which claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people. According to AOC, the hurricane that killed her grandfather happened because of climate change, and climate change is caused by corporations, and corporations are run by white people, thus white people killed her grandfather.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not kidding.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, AOC was asking questions of the National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Mustafa Ali when she unleashed her \u201clogic\u201d on the room:\n\n\u201c[T]he people that are producing climate change, the folks that are responsible for the largest amount of emissions, or communities, or corporations, they tend to be predominantly white, correct?\u201d she asked at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties.\n\nThe National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Mustafa Ali replied that \u201cyes, and every study backs that up I know no one is intentionally trying to kill people and hurt people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy own grandfather died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria,\u201d said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, referring to the 2017 Puerto Rico storm that ultimately left about 3,000 dead. \u201cWe can\u2019t act as though the inertia and history of colonization doesn\u2019t play a role in this.\u201d\n\nTo translate AOC: White people created a hurricane that killed a member of my family.\n\nThis is stuff I expect a drug-addicted homeless person to be shouting at me as I walk by him on the sidewalk, not an elected member of congress.\n\nLuckily, at least one member of Congress there maintained his sanity. Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy used the example of the storm of 1900 in Galveston, Texas, to point out how ridiculous Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s accusation is according to the Washington Examiner:\n\nRep. Chip Roy, Texas Republican, pointed out that the deadliest hurricane in North American history remains the 1900 Great Galveston Storm, which killed between 6,000 and 12,000 people, making landfall well before the rise of atmospheric carbon-dioxide emissions. What\u2019s more, he said, low-income communities will be the hardest hit if climate change initiatives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposed ban on hydraulic fracturing are enacted. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the massive violation of civil liberties that will occur if we do as Elizabeth Warren has said, and ban fracking,\u201d said Mr. Roy. \u201cLet\u2019s crush the American economy and crush the jobs not only in Texas but around the United States, and ban fracking in a fit of hysteria, undermining the very civil liberties of the Americans that depend on that affordable and available abundant energy.\u201d\n\nThis hearing about climate change and fossil fuels coincides with a New York \u201cclimate fraud\u201d trial centered on ExxonMobile and what it \u201cknew\u201d about climate change effects decades ago. According to Roy, this hearing is a dog and pony show meant to generate media outrage.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this hearing seems to be to stir up a media frenzy and provide a storyline for the current court case in New York, a case that isn\u2019t even about allegedly covering up the truth about climate change anymore, but about accounting disagreements,\u201d noted Roy.\n\nThe effects of social justice adherence never seem to be good, and here we see an elected member of Congress sinking so far into racism that she\u2019s blaming the creation of hurricanes \u2014 a natural event that has been occurring since well before the age of industrialization \u2014 on white people.\n\nOcasio-Cortez also made a wild claim recently, blaming the California wildfires on climate change, and putting the fault for that at the feet of the GOP. However, upon tweeting out this assertion, much of Twitter fired back and corrected her falsehoods.\n\n(READ: AOC Blames The California Wildfires On \u201cClimate Change,\u201d But The Internet Isn\u2019t Having It)", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy: AOC Sinks to Blaming White People for the Death of Her Grandfather", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Nick Arama", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Kira Davis", "Brad Slager", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AOCAPphoto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
