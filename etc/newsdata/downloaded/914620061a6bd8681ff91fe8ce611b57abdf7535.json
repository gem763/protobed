He deleted it later, however, when the consequences of his criticizing it became clear.\n\nChinese state television is now refusing to show pre-season games and businesses have cut ties with the Rockets in response to Morey's tweet.\n\nThe NBA has come under intense scrutiny for buckling and expressing 'regret' over Morey's post.\n\nThis article appeared on The Global Times, a Chinese government newspaper, on Monday\n\nIn China, the NBA is a billion dollar franchise with millions of fans. All that could not be in jeopardy thanks to the country's no-holds-barred reaction to Morey's tweet.\n\nThe Global Times article defended its position and said it was 'ridiculous' to suggest Morey was entitled to free speech.\n\n'The incident shows an expanding worldwide culture gap.\n\n'Imagine if Morey publicly tweeted support for the Beijing and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, would rioters in Hong Kong smash up Rockets' logos in the city?\n\nMorey has neither the IQ nor the EQ to talk about political topics\n\n'Commercial and cultural organizations which engage in transnational operations should manage their attitudes and statements over sensitive issues. Impulsive words can easily trigger a backlash.\n\n'As the general manager of the Rockets, Morey shoulders the main responsibility for the marketing of his team, but he invited trouble on himself and offended the public on the Chinese mainland. His professional capability is simply too poor.'\n\nIt went on: 'Some Americans try to link Morey's tweet with so-called \"freedom of speech.\" That is ridiculous.\n\n'Morey does have the freedom to praise Hong Kong protesters, just like the Chinese fans also have the freedom to abandon the Rockets.\n\nHouston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, apologized on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted over the weekend that included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong'\n\nPolice fire tear gas into a crowd of protesters in Hong Kong on October 1. The protesters are fighting against China's communist regime\n\nThe NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Tuesday defended Morey and his right to free speech\n\nThe Rockets game against the Toronto Raptors in Japan last night. China is not showing pre-season NBA games this week on state TV\n\n'The problem is that Morey's freedom is at the expense of Rockets' huge commercial interests, which the team is unwilling to give up. It's a paradox with which Americans are grappling.'\n\nTIMELINE OF ROCKETS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA 2002: The Houston Rockets drafts Chinese basketball player Yao Ming, who goes on to become a star for them and helps build the NBA's following in China 2009: Yao purchases the Shanghai Sharks, his former CBA team July 20, 2011: Hall of Fame center Yao announces his retirement and leaves the Rockets after helping them to build a huge following in China 2016: Shanghai-born Yao is elected to the Hall of Fame February 23, 2017: The Chinese Basketball Association votes unanimously to appoint former Houston Rockets star Ming as its president October 4, 2019: Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweets an image of the Hong Kong activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.' It prompts outrage from Chinese fans with Chinese business partners halting work with the NBA team as a result. October 5, 2019: The Rockets try to distance themselves from the controversy, with owner Tilman Fertitta writing on Twitter that Morey 'does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets... we are NOT a political organization'. October 6, 2019: Morey apologizes, saying he didn't intend to offend fans in China. The NBA issues its own statement, saying it recognizes Morey's views 'have offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.' U.S. lawmakers argue that the NBA's response is shameful and shows how China is using its economic power to censor speech by Americans.\n\nThe article then claimed that while Chinese consumers are not 'overly sensitive' and that 'entities that value commercial interests must make their members speak cautiously.'\n\n'Wherever it is, touching a raw political nerve is extremely risky. Morey has neither the IQ nor the EQ to talk about political topics.\n\n'He will become an example of clumsiness on some MBA courses,' it concluded.\n\nOn Monday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver spoke up for freedom of speech saying it was not up to the NBA to regulate what players, employees and team owners said, nor to adjudicate differences between people around the world.\n\nThe NBA had earlier issued a statement saying it regretted Morey's remarks, which drew harsh criticism from U.S. lawmakers.\n\nBut Silver, who is in Japan for an exhibition game, later defended Morey and said the NBA was not apologizing for him 'expressing his freedom of expression'.\n\n'It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues,' Silver said in a statement.\n\nThe Rockets are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Yao Ming in 2002, who became a star for Houston and helped build the NBA's following in China.\n\nYao, who is now the Chinese basketball chief, is 'extremely hot' over the controversy sparked by Morey's pro-democracy tweet.\n\nSilver said he hoped to work with Yao to cool the escalating dispute after saying variously that he was 'extremely upset', 'extremely unsettled' and 'extremely hot'.\n\n'I am hoping that together, Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation,' said Silver, who visits Yao's hometown of Shanghai on Wednesday for two pre-season exhibition games.\n\n'But he is extremely hot at the moment and I understand it.'\n\nAlthough the two league bosses would be expected to meet as the NBA stages its annual China pre-season exhibition games, Silver did not explicitly confirm that a meeting would take place.\n\nSilver said the NBA had 'communicated directly' with Yao over the controversy.", "description": "The warning, which was included in a piece by The Global Times, was the latest development in the row surrounding a tweet posted by\u00a0Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey on October 4.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19464140-0-image-a-2_1570571515816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
