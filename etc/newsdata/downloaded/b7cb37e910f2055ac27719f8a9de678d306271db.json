But as I watched dozens of dollar bills fly into the air for the umpteenth time and my finger instinctively pressed for the suction button, hoovering these beautifully rendered dollars to my virtual bank account, I fell into mild panic: Why am I doing this? Why am I spending so much time on these useless collectibles? Which, okay, perhaps an unfair quadrant to exclusively dump on Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, given how many other games also do this, but Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is the first time in a while it felt like the pointlessness was so front and center. Panic grew over my honest, emotional response: I like collecting this useless garbage.\n\nThere is money everywhere in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3. Dollars stuffed into drawers. Golden bars hidden behind a set of curtains. Everywhere you turn, every object you interact with teems with currency. The action you engage with the most in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, more than fighting ghosts or solving puzzles, is sucking up and collecting money, lots of money. It gives the impression that dang, money must be pretty valuable, and the player should collect as much as humanly possible. It is not. This is not true. Money is virtually useless in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, outside of buying extra lives and trackers for\u2014you guessed it\u2014even more collectibles. There is no skill tree to upgrade with cash, no features to unlock. It is, largely, pointless.\n\nExcept that\u2019s not really true, and my moment of crisis only underscores what, truly, has always been the appeal of Luigi\u2019s Mansion, going all the way back to the original game from 2001: the sheer joy of discovery, the unexpected delight of poking and prodding at a tightly contained space and seeing what surprises the level designer has hidden. Whereas other long-running franchises tend to get ambitious in the very specific direction of large, open spaces, Luigi\u2019s Mansion has resisted this urge and, much like Super Mario Odyssey, turned its attention towards an ever increasing density that rewards curiosity.\n\nWhen I attended a press event for Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 earlier this year, Nintendo said the player should feel like every room in the game\u2014 every room\u2014should hide a secret for them to discover. I believe them. You pull on an innocuous object, like a poster, only to reveal a hole that Luigi can peer in, revealing another secret in another room around the corner. The best discoveries in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 are nesting dolls, a clue towards a much larger puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019s technically a story driving Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, in which the Mushroom Kingdom crew takes a vacation to a fancy hotel that\u2019s actually a ghost trap and only Luigi can save the day. It\u2019s a dressed up excuse for Luigi to walk around a bunch of rooms where the first question isn\u2019t \u201cWhat object can I interact with?\u201d but \u201cWhat object can\u2019t I interact with?\u201d It\u2019s a game where players are exploring carefully crafted, beautifully lit doll houses\u2014and tearing them apart, piece by piece, turning a place of beauty into a pile of trash, eating up the good trash and leaving the rest. Creating the wreckage, by accident and on purpose, is what\u2019s always made Luigi\u2019s Mansion so delightful, and this third entry umps the ante considerably. You can tear this hotel to pieces, if you\u2019d like, and the game will only smile.\n\nYour main point of interaction, as always, is the Poltergust 3000, essentially a fancy vacuum that also has the potential to suck up pesky ghosts. One button sucks in air, another button pushes it out. In a lot of ways, it plays like a dual stick shooter with some surprisingly clumsy controls. (I\u2019ve always had trouble aiming in these games.) Tapping a flashlight on and off will stun most ghosts, which puts them in a state where the Poltergust 3000 can slam them into the ground, chipping away at their, uh, ghost health? Don\u2019t think about it too much. You can also fire a plunger, which lets you pull on larger objects, tear down parts of walls, and more.\n\nThe biggest addition to Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, a game that\u2019s otherwise pretty modest in terms of genuinely new ideas, is Gooigi, a slimy manifestation of Luigi that can slide through objects like sewer grates and fences, gaining access to otherwise locked areas. You can\u2019t control Luigi and Gooigi at the same time, but you can have them work in tandem, i.e. they can both attach plungers to an extremely large object at the same time, letting them move it. The pairing leads to some of the game\u2019s more delightful puzzles. In one section, Luigi operates a camera aimed at a movie set, while Gooigi is the one wandering around the set. Given how marquee the presentation of Gooigi is within the game, it\u2019s actually surprising the amount of times the game goes through long stretches where you basically don\u2019t use him; far and away, the duality of Luigi and Gooigi produces the most satisfying brain twisters.\n\nSo much of Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is staring at a room, causing chaos, and examining what\u2019s left. In Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, what you\u2019re examining is, weirdly, gorgeous. I regularly found myself in awe just looking at the game. There was a moment where, while playing the game in handheld mode, I genuinely believed a high-res CG cutscene was playing out, so I dropped the Switch on the couch, while I scribbled down a note. In actuality, the game was patiently waiting for me to pick up and keep going.\n\nThe lighting in this game, my god. The way the moon\u2019s light casts into the hotel from the outside, the way disco lights casually bounce around the room in a pseudo dance club. And character models are stunning, to the point that I want to make a pointless Pixar comparison because it might clumsily explain how the game can strike you as a polished work, as if you\u2019re being given the chance to wander around a Luigi\u2019s Mansion TV show. The rooms, and even the mansion itself, are tiny by 2019 video game standards, but the game smartly takes advantage of that more compact space by making what\u2019s there look positively stunning.\n\nAt times, though, it can feel like the visuals are there to distract from the game\u2019s unyielding repetition. There\u2019s just not much to do. Yes, there\u2019s a decent amount of puzzles that are clever and interesting, especially in the back half of the game, but it\u2019s not enough. Yes, there\u2019s a fair amount of combat against a variety of spectral enemies, but the vast majority of combat is too simplistic. All the player does is zap with a flashlight, tap on the Poltergust, smack \u2018em around a few times, and move onto the next one. The lone bright spot here is the game\u2019s abundance of tricky, funny, and surprisingly difficult boss battles, like a dancing piano who wields music like a weapon, or a stomping skeletal T-Rex whose stomps reveal their own weakness. These fights were such a highlight that I was rushing through the next area to see what was in store.\n\nAnd so, a tremendous amount of whether you will enjoy Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is contingent on how much you enjoy its core conceit: exploring a space largely for the sake of exploring the space. How many times will you enjoy hoovering couches and newspapers and breaking lamps? For me it was enough\u2014though sometimes just barely. There\u2019s no sense of progression for Luigi or the Poltergust, no new features or tricks to unlock. How you start the game is, basically, how it ends. It\u2019s a game where I enjoyed thoughtlessly sucking up money for no purpose outside of the act itself, a conceit compelling enough to get me to the end.\n\nIt took me a little under 15 hours to finish Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, a count buffered by getting hung up on a mid-game puzzle I suspect others will not. Had I not been playing for review, in which I was burning through the game, I suspect I might have had an even better time. So much of the game is built on repetition\u2014again, a repetition the game sees as a strength, not a weakness\u2014that it\u2019s only understandable to occasionally get exasperated by shotgunning the game like a can of beer. It\u2019s likely to have been a more enjoyable game enjoyed at a more leisurely pace.\n\nLuigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is not ambitious, and it\u2019s not reinventing what came before it. It is not a game trying to convert anyone\u2014is what it is, happily. When the credits rolled, though, there was a sense of \u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d I\u2019ve enjoyed the Luigi\u2019s Mansion games to this point, but the next time around, you\u2019re going to have to offer me a little more to do, Luigi.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter.
