And they specifically feel some feelings about the hot dogs. Even Julia Child reportedly loved them! Well, now even vegans want to get in on the fun, as more than 2,000 people have signed a petition for Costco to add a vegan hot dog to its menu.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, the Change.org petition was created by Scott Hildebrand, who said he wanted a plant-based option that he and his family could eat when they visit the store. Apparently, thousands agreed. At the time of this writing, 2,014 people have signed the petition, making it very likely that it would reach its goal of hitting 2,500.\n\n\"Our family, like countless others, are regulars at Costco. I'd love to see them extend plant-based options to the food court, so we can enjoy veggie hot dogs after a Sunday shopping trip,\" he told BI.\n\nIt may sound out there, but a meatless hot dog would not be out of the ordinary these days. In fact, Costco added items like a meatless burger and an acai bowl to its food court menu in recent months. Competitors like IKEA have even announced they'll be adding a meatless version of their famous meatballs in 2020. Delish reached out to Costco in regard to the petition but did not immediately hear back.\n\nIt's unclear if this petition will be successful, but I think we can all agree...no one should put ketchup on a hot dog. Veggie or otherwise.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Hot diggity (veggie) dog!", "authors": ["Kristin Salaky"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MRyLweJTzRZNz3twZgWiLQ--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/delish_597/858e272a39258cb2efc1a2915078c681", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
