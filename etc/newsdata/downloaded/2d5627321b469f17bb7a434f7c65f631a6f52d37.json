Everything that he\u2019s done in his career up to that point led up to him being on call that night. If anything had gone any differently, I might not have had a bottom jaw.\u201d\n\nEmily said she has written to the Queen to get the surgeon a knighthood and received a personal letter straight back from her secretary saying it had been referred to the relevant body.\n\n\u201cSaving people\u2019s lives and getting them back to normality definitely deserves some sort of recognition,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily Eccles during her recovery (Family handout/PA)\n\nEmily lives in a village just outside Sheffield with her teacher parents Michelle, 50, and Chris, 48; her brother Sam, 17, and their two dogs.\n\nShe said \u201cI\u2019m not a horse rider\u201d, but insisted: \u201cI\u2019d like to ride a horse again it\u2019s my parents I have to convince.\u201d\n\nMrs Eccles said she was \u201cstill thinking about it\u201d.\n\nMr Mohammed-Ali said: \u201cIt could have been worse, but it is one of the most significant injuries that I have seen in a child outside of areas of conflict.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cEmily\u2019s injury was significant in that the entire left side of her lower jaw from the front of the jaw to the joint was pulled away from the face and only retained by a small strip of skin.\n\n\u201cThe nerves that supply sensation to the lip and chin was torn on both sides. Branches of the facial nerve that move the muscles of the lower lip were severed on both sides. The lower part of Emily\u2019s face was only attached by a piece of skin.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI am extremely pleased with her recovery so far.\u201d\n\nThe family said they are determined to support The Children\u2019s Hospital Charity\u2019s fundraising to help improve the Emergency Department and provide a helipad above the hospital.\n\nThe air ambulance was called to Emily\u2019s accident but it was decided to go by road, partly because the helicopter currently has to land in a park opposite the building, her family said.", "description": "Emily Eccles has written to the Queen after suffering", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/wire-19435504-1570526913-162_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
