There are just 919 convictions for the 60,000 reported attacks. The situation in the US is even bleaker, with an estimated five people convicted for every 1,000 offences.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that some people still believe that rape isn\u2019t a cut-and-dried crime \u2013 that maybe the victim was \u201casking for it\u201d or that they are simply lying. Netflix\u2019s new eight-part drama, Unbelievable, attempts to explore this situation. It\u2019s an adaptation of a Pulitzer-winning article from US investigative site ProPublica, about a young woman from Lynnwood, Washington, who claimed she had been tied up and raped in her bedroom before changing her story and eventually denying that the attack had ever happened. We follow Marie Adler (Booksmart\u2019s Kaitlyn Dever), an 18-year-old who is fresh from \u201ca million\u201d foster placements, living in a kind of halfway house for people transitioning out of care. She cuts a vulnerable figure and is an unreliable narrator, alternately panicked and disinterested. But did she make up the attack, or was she merely bewildered by intrusive, endless questioning from the police? And how does the work of two female detectives (Karen Duvall, played by Merritt Wever, and Toni Collette\u2019s Grace Rasmussen) three years later affect the situation?\n\nDoes the 'female gaze' make sexual violence on film any less repugnant? Read more\n\nUnbelievable could have ended up a nasty, voyeuristic programme full of gratuitous violence. Sexual assault, after all, isn\u2019t something TV always deals with sensitively \u2013 just look at Game of Thrones, where rape, particularly that of Sansa Stark, sparked outrage from viewers and even a US senator. Or it could\u2019ve been another drab procedural, heavy on cliches borrowed from a thousand crime stories before it. Thankfully, it manages to find another way, by focusing on the grey area of its title \u2013 showing the propensity for those around Adler to assume her guilt from the outset, and to marry her \u201cacting out\u201d with the rape allegation.\n\nScenes with the police are reminiscent of those in other Netflix originals \u2013 namely documentaries Making a Murderer, When They See Us and The Confession Tapes \u2013 heavy with leading questions and assumptions. Why, ask those first (male) detectives, would Adler keep changing her story unless it had all been an invention? Does she understand the gravity of false reporting? The repetition of such scenes emphasises the administrative nightmare of the situation, while a parallel event in the second episode \u2013 another girl, a college student, claims to have been attacked in similar circumstances \u2013 shows how Adler\u2019s class and background affect her treatment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Panicked narrator \u2026 Kaitlyn Dever as Marie Adler. Photograph: Beth Dubber/Netflix\n\nElsewhere the series does well to temper swift flashback scenes of Adler\u2019s alleged attack with a fleshed-out portrayal of somebody in crisis. There\u2019s a True Detective feel to the scenes between Wever and Collette, as they try to piece together something they can\u2019t quite make sense of. Like Adler\u2019s recollections, their own lines of inquiry are fuzzy. But unlike Adler, they have social status on their side. There\u2019s an inherent feminism in watching these two women fight for other women, even if the \u201cnot just a mother\u201d trope is sometimes hammered home a little too heavily: in one scene, while her husband prepares dinner and her children potter around, Duvall continues to telephone neighbouring police departments cut off from the domesticity around her.\n\nUnbelievable isn\u2019t a programme about whether Adler was telling the truth. It\u2019s about who gets to have their story heard, who is allowed to be believed. It\u2019s about the power dynamics that underpin the criminal justice system and society at large. \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d, Adler asks the police who take her first statements. The answer for her, and so many others like her, is a resounding yes.", "description": "Netflix\u2019s drama about a retracted rape allegation is a fiercely feminist look at the nature of truth and whose stories get heard", "authors": ["Hannah J Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee6fdcde4946be5dabfba8bb3fd34707c09ad9cf/0_156_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=59b76bf023cafb49fbf400acf8361513", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
