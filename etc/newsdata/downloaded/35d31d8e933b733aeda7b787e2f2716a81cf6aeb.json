(AP)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. \u2013 Listen closely, and you can hear the robotic voice from late-night informercial infamy promising instant results. \u201cCall now, and all you need to do is add a quarterback.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what this unprecedented and uninhibited run of Oklahoma quarterbacks under Lincoln Riley feels like, right? Like it\u2019s so easy to run through and throw over opponents that the pitch is as simple as hawking a Shake Weight, ThighMaster or Soloflex.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nYou can hear that voice urging you to dial the 1-800 number sometime after last call: Transfer now, and receive pinball yardage totals, broken records and, if you\u2019re one of the first 100 callers, you\u2019ll get your very own Heisman Trophy.\n\nHow else to explain the inexplicable run that Oklahoma is sprinting toward for a third consecutive season under third-year coach Lincoln Riley? In the wake of Heisman Trophy seasons by Baker Mayfield (2017) and Kyler Murray (2018), Oklahoma\u2019s latest transfer quarterback marvel, Jalen Hurts, shipped and handled overmatched Houston on Sunday night, 49-31. Hurts accounted for six touchdowns and, along the way, demanded Heisman Trophy attention.\n\nThe most fascinating experiment in college football proceeded with predictably robust and rousing results in its opening salvo. Hurts is the most accomplished transfer at OU \u2013 or, really, anywhere \u2013 in this era of college football. He arrived after going 26-2 as a starter at Alabama, winning the SEC Player of the Year as a freshman and compiling 48 touchdown passes and 5,626 yards in his three seasons there.\n\nHurts referred to his situation as \u201cunprecedented\u201d multiple times postgame and summed up his Alabama-to-Oklahoma transfer perfectly: \u201cI\u2019m back where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd he joins what needs to be considered the most coveted position in all of this era of college football, like a modern version of playing tailback at USC in the Student Body Right generation. There\u2019s no position in football that virtually assures success like Oklahoma quarterback. It carries with it the cachet of hitting clean-up for the Yankees, playing on the frontline for the Lakers or quarterback for the Packers.\n\nThe 508 total yards and three rushing and three passing touchdowns against Houston from Hurts weren\u2019t reality a surprise when you consider taking a player of Hurts\u2019 talent, experience and production and combining him with an offensive mastermind of Riley\u2019s caliber. Riley has emerged as the creative and innovative answer, this decade\u2019s version of Urban Meyer or Chip Kelly. And the results have been equal-parts devastating and enjoyable.\n\nOklahoma Sooners quarterback Jalen Hurts (1) throws during the first half against the Houston Cougars. (USAT)\n\nIn the annals of college football, many a bold game-one prediction has been met with mockery by Columbus Day. So we\u2019re not yet handing the Heisman Trophy to Jalen Hurts this season \u2013 which would be an unprecedented third straight for one school. We\u2019ll wait for him to play a team that didn\u2019t give up 70 the last time they played. But would you really bet against him at this point? Would you bet against the Sooners \u2013 with some nice moments of grit and edge under new defensive coordinator Alex Grinch \u2013 making the playoff for a third consecutive time?\n\nHurts took a Ginsu knife to the Houston defense finishing 20-for-23 passing for 332 yards amid a Sunday night showcase in Norman. He added 176 more rushing yards, averaging 11 yards a clip. No, the Cougars won\u2019t be mistaken this year for the 1985 Bears \u2013 or even Tom Herman\u2019s 2016 Cougars \u2013 but it was dizzying, clinical and confirms Hurts as a weekly must-watch, just like his predecessors.\n\nWhat did Hurts look like in his new shade of Crimson (other than his red-taped cleats, which were Judy Garland-esque)? Well, Riley highlighted Hurts\u2019 skill set with a deft mix of quarterback counters, tight end slip routes and good ole downfield verticals. There were option runs, crossing routes and zone reads. The sheer variance and volume of things Riley did with Hurts, combined with elite weapons in junior tailback Trey Sermon (91 rushing yards) and future first-round receiver CeeDee Lamb, portends boundless possibility for this Oklahoma offense.\n\nHurts finished with his most impressive night amid a starry career, as he ended up with 61 more yards than his highest output for Alabama at Mississippi State in 2016, when he totaled 447 yards. He set a Sooner record for yards in a debut and registered the fifth-highest total yards in a game in school history.\n\nPerhaps the most telling part of Hurts\u2019 debut in Norman was how casually it was received. Lincoln Riley isn\u2019t prone to hyperbole, but his tone sounded a little bit like he was pleased with a solid blitz pickup in the Sooners\u2019 seventh spring practice. Riley\u2019s gems included: \u201cHe played good. He played good.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s an impressive athlete.\u201d\n\nRiley\u2019s understated reactions speak to the culture of expectations of that position, as the coach was pleased but not blown away.\n\nHurts showed that part of Nick Saban's monotone have stuck with him, as he deflected any praise or hints at future success being inevitable. But he did have some insight into his unusual journey: \"God has put me in some crazy, unprecedented situations,\" he said. \"But nothing I can't handle.\"\n\nHe added about starting for two storied programs: \"There's this whole unprecedented situation, playing at a school like Alabama and Oklahoma. Ain't many people in the world who can say that they've done that.\"\n\nIf this flicking away of Houston like a pesky June bug could be summed up in one play, that would be Hurts leaping in the air to complete a 47-yard touchdown pass to Lamb in the second quarter. Lamb was so open streaking on a go route that some versions of replay didn\u2019t include a Houston defender in the television screen. In reality, Houston\u2019s D.J. Small was precisely 10 yards behind Lamb when the ball nestled into his hands.\n\nThe freeze frame offered the perfect metaphor for a night that reminded all of college football that everyone is still chasing Riley, no matter who his quarterback is.\n\nAnd you have to wonder if some accomplished college quarterback wasn\u2019t sitting at home tonight, watching the advertorial for Heisman Trophy play and wondering whether he should pick up the phone.\n\nCall now. Operators are standing by. Results are guaranteed.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jalen Hurts was just about perfect in his Oklahoma debut \u2014 which shows that the inside track to winning a Heisman Trophy may just mean transferring to Norman to be a Sooner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/27NRRqjwgW6d3pHEWhdzdw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MTI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.QtSUU4C_SbV4EqOW8MQAg--~B/aD0yNTQ4O3c9MzU3NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7b519c50-cd29-11e9-bbdf-cb430468f932"}
