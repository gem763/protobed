Attila Csaszar\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClothing chains aren't the only retailers facing a margin squeeze from the weaker currency and the trade war. Home improvement, hardware, electronics and sporting goods retailers are also weighing the pros and cons.\n\n\"It's something we're thinking about pretty carefully - we are noticing a lot of Chinese suppliers are moving into adjacent countries for production, they're going into South-east Asia and Vietnam to avoid the tariffs,\" said Anthony Heraghty, chief executive of Super Retail Group, which owns Rebel, BCF and Super Cheap Auto.\n\n\"That potentially creates some capacity in the Chinese manufacturing system that we might be able to take advantage of, but Australia is very small scale in the global manufacturing world,\" he said.\n\n\"Whilst we like to think at Super Retail Group we are really important we are a small part of that manufacturing economy. We might be able to squeeze out an advantage but that's yet to be seen.\"", "description": "As the Australian dollar falls, retailers are weighing the pros and cons of the China/US trade war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.2238%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_70/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5c4d18d023e2e5b24a78a490906b9be1ba6e0c72", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
