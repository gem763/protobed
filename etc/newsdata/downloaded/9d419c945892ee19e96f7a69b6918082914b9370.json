His departure might be worse.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nI did not welcome John Bolton\u2019s appointment as national security adviser. But now that he has been fired (or has resigned), I am more ambivalent about his departure than I had expected. In some ways he has been as bad as I feared, but in other ways he has been an important check on an impetuous president. If his replacement is a yes-man (or woman), the result could actually be worse.\n\nWhen Bolton\u2019s appointment was announced in March 2018, I described him in The Post as a \u201cwild man\u201d with legendary \u201cantipathy toward international treaties and organizations,\u201d a lack of \u201cthe kind of interpersonal skills\u201d that a national security adviser needs \u201cto coordinate all of the defense and foreign-policy agencies,\u201d and a worrisome predilection for preemptive wars against Iran and North Korea.\n\nI was right to worry that the foreign policy process would become more \u201cchaotic\u201d under Bolton. He disdained attempts by his predecessor, H.R. McMaster, to consult with other agencies. Bolton froze other officials out of the process in the hope that he alone could shape President Trump\u2019s decision-making. A long profile in the Atlantic noted: \u201cIf the NSC under McMaster was a consultative body, under Bolton it has become the opposite.\u201d\n\nHow ironic, then, that Bolton \u2014 who began his tenure by excluding bureaucratic rivals \u2014 wound up being excluded himself from decision-making about Afghan peace negotiations. His skepticism of a deal was said to have \u201cirritated\u201d Trump. But here\u2019s the thing: Much as I disagree with Bolton on many issues, he was right to be wary of a deal that would have led to U.S. troop withdrawal in return for empty promises of good behavior from the Taliban. Even Trump now seems to recognize that \u2014 having, at least temporarily, abandoned negotiations because the Taliban would not stop its attacks.\n\n[The Post\u2019s View: John Bolton\u2019s legacy of chaos, dysfunction and no meaningful accomplishments]\n\nBolton was also right to be skeptical about peace talks with North Korea. Unlike Trump, he never fell in love with North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un. Bolton played an important role at the Hanoi summit in February in persuading Trump not to take a very bad deal after Kim offered to close down only one of his many nuclear facilities in exchange for a lifting of U.S. sanctions. Bolton has also been correct to note that North Korea\u2019s short-range missile tests violated United Nations sanctions. Trump, by contrast, has recklessly given Kim permission to continue developing short-range missiles that place U.S. troops and U.S. allies in South Korea and Japan in harm\u2019s way.\n\nBolton played a more destabilizing and dangerous role when it came to Iran. McMaster, along with former defense secretary Jim Mattis and former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, had urged Trump to maintain the Iran nuclear accord because the Iranians were abiding by its terms. But within a month of Bolton\u2019s ascension, Trump announced that the United States was exiting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (as the accord is known). This was followed by unilateral sanctions on Iran.\n\nTrump seemed to expect that U.S. pressure would cause Iran to come back to the table to negotiate an even more restrictive agreement. But instead of giving in, Iran has struck back. It has been accused of attacking shipping in the Persian Gulf (a charge it denies), and it has not reined in its militant proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon or Yemen. Most ominous of all, Iran is now stepping up uranium enrichment in violation of the accord\u2019s limits.\n\nBolton led Trump into a strategic dead end with no obvious way out save a resurrection of the nuclear accord or a war with Iran. The latter option loomed menacingly close in June after Iran shot down a U.S. drone. Trump ordered air strikes on Iran before changing his mind. The president\u2019s decision not to strike back was a repudiation of Bolton, who had, as usual, advocated the most bellicose course of action. A senior official quoted Trump telling associates, \u201cIf it was up to John, we\u2019d be in four wars now.\u201d Having recoiled from military action, Trump has now expressed willingness to talk with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and even to extend financing to Iran \u2014 policy options that are anathema to the hawkish Bolton.\n\nNor did Bolton\u2019s advice produce the quick and easy win that Trump unreasonably expected in Venezuela. Trump went all-in to support a military coup against Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. After the uprising fizzled out, The Post reported on June 19 that Trump was \u201closing both patience and interest in Venezuela.\u201d Now Trump has lost patience and interest with the national security adviser he blamed for the failure in Venezuela \u2014 and Iran.\n\nBolton made many mistakes \u2014 just as his critics had expected \u2014 but he is not the real reason that U.S. foreign policy has been so erratic and unsuccessful over the past 17 months. If Trump wants to find the real culprit for his failed foreign policy, he should look in the mirror. Not even a president with far more acumen than Trump could possibly formulate and execute a successful foreign policy amid such incessant staff turnover \u2014 and such abrupt shifts of direction.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Bolton is out, proving blind loyalty to a narcissist never works\n\nPaul Waldman: Trump\u2019s firing of Bolton was good.
