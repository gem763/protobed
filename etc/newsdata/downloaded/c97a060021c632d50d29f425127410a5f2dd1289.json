Yared Getachew went haywire.\n\nThe digital displays for altitude, airspeed and other basic information showed dramatically different readings from those in front of his co-pilot. The controls in Capt. Getachew\u2019s hands started shaking to warn him the plane was climbing too steeply and was in imminent danger of falling from the sky.\n\nSoon, a cascade of warning tones and colored lights and mechanical voices filled the cockpit. The pilots spoke in clipped bursts.\n\n\u201cCommand!\u201d Capt. Getachew called out twice, trying to activate the autopilot. Twice he got a warning horn.\n\nAnother powerful automated flight-control system called MCAS abruptly pushed down the jet\u2019s nose. A computerized voice blared: \u201cDon\u2019t sink! Don\u2019t sink!\u201d\n\nThe pilots wrestled with the controls, desperate to raise the nose of their Boeing 737 MAX. Three times Capt. Getachew instructed co-pilot Ahmed Nur Mohammed, \u201cPull up!\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a loud clacking warned the preoccupied pilots that the plane was flying too fast.\n\nFour minutes into the flight, the pilots finally touched on the source of their problems, simultaneously calling out \u201cLeft alpha vane!\u201d\n\nTap left to go back Tap right\n\nto continue Fatal Emergency A jumble of loud and contradictory warnings confronted the captain and his co-pilot of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 shortly after takeoff on March 10. Tap to continue 8:37:34 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Air Traffic Control granted Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 clearance to take off. About a minute after takeoff, the airplane\u2019s left and right \u2018angle of attack\u2019 vanes recorded different values, unbeknownst to the pilots. Investigators believe a bird strike damaged the captain-side vane. 8:38:44 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Stick shaker control vibrates A stall-warning known as a \u2018stick shaker\u2019 causes the captain's controls to start vibrating. Different altitude, air speed and pitch-related readings appear on the captain\u2019s and first officer\u2019s displays. 8:38:58 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Captain: \u2018Command\u2019\u2014a standard call-out for autopilot engagement\u2014is called out twice. Autopilot warning audible warning The crew twice attempted to engage autopilot, but hear an autopilot warning instead, signaling that system wouldn\u2019t activate. 8:39:22 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 The pilot\u2019s autopilot was engaged, followed by the plane slightly rolling and accelerating sideways. 8:39:55 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Captain: Advised first officer to request to maintain runway heading, noting flight-control problems. Autopilot disengaged again. 8:40:00 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 MCAS, which stands for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, misfired for nine seconds, using the horizontal stabilizer to push down the plane\u2019s nose, arresting the climb and causing the jet to descend slightly. 8:40:03 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 \u2018DON\u2019T SINK\u2019 alerts by the plane\u2019s Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded. A few seconds later, the pilots pulled back the controls and the airplane began to climb. 8:40:12 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Three more GPWS \u2018DON\u2019T SINK\u2019 alerts occurred from 8:40:23 to 8:40:31 a.m. The pilots used electric trim switches on the yoke to order the plane\u2019s nose up, but its angle remained largely unchanged. Eight seconds later, MCAS automatically misfired for a second time. 8:40:27 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Captain: Asked first officer to work with him to raise the nose. First-officer: Called out \u2018stab trim cut-out\u2019 twice. Captain agreed. Electric trim commands counteracted the stabilizer\u2019s movement pushing the plane downward, before the crew hit the trim cut-out switches that disable electric motors that control the horizontal stabilizer. 8:40:41 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Captain: Called out \u2018pull up\u2019 three times. First-officer: Acknowledged. MCAS tried but failed to push down nose, because the pilots had disabled the automated feature. 8:40:42 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 First-officer: Made request to air-traffic controllers to maintain 14,000-feet altitude and reported flight-control problems. For roughly the next two and a half minutes, the stabilizer position gradually moved the aircraft in the nose-down direction. The pilots were pulling back on the yoke to raise the nose the entire time. The captain's indicated airspeed increased from approximately 351 mph to approximately 391 mph. The first officer's indicated airspeed was approximately 26 mph higher than the captain's. 8:41:30 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Captain: Pitch up. First-officer: Acknowledged. Overspeed clacker audible warning The first officer's overspeed clacker was recorded on the cockpit voice recorder (and remained active until the end of the recording). Shortly thereafter, the captain's overspeed warning activated (and was intermittently until the end of the recording). 8:41:46 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Captain: Asked if the \u2018trim\u2019 system that controls the horizontal stabilizer was functional. First-officer: Responded the trim wasn't working and asked if he could try it manually. 8:41:54 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Captain: Told first officer to try it. First-officer: Reported it isn't working. Requested a vector to return from Air Traffic Control, which was approved. 8:42:54 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Captain: \u2018Left alpha vane.\u2019 Told the first officer pitch up together, and that pitch is not enough. First-officer: \u2018Left alpha vane.\u2019 The first officer mentioned \u2018Master Caution Anti-Ice,\u2019 noting an alert that prompts pilots to look up at indicators on an overhead panel. 8:43:11 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 Two momentary manual electric trim inputs from the pilots are recorded in the nose-up direction. The stabilizer moved the aircraft in the nose-up direction. 8:43:20 a.m. :37 :38 :39 :40 :41 :42 :43 :44 MCAS misfired for the third and final time \u2013 pushing the plane\u2019s nose down for five seconds \u2013 indicating the pilots had turned the automated system and associated electric trim motors back on. The aircraft began pitching nose down. Additional manual pulls on the control columns failed to stop the nose from eventually reaching a 40-degree downward angle. Seconds later, Flight 302 crashed, killing all 157 people on board. RETURN TO BEGINNING Note: All times are local and correspond to at least one event in each panel.

Flight 302 nose-dived at nearly the speed of sound, hitting the ground with such force that an airliner with 157 people aboard was largely reduced to fragments no bigger than a man\u2019s arm.\n\nFive months earlier, Lion Air Flight 610 had plunged into the Java Sea, killing 189 people, under similar circumstances.\n\nRegulators have focused since the crashes on MCAS, its reliance on a single sensor and Boeing BA 0.37% \u2019s decision not to tell pilots about the new system. At the root of the miscalculations, though, were Boeing\u2019s overly optimistic assumptions about pilot behavior.\n\nIn designing the flight controls for the 737 MAX, Boeing assumed that pilots trained on existing safety procedures should be able to sift through the jumble of contradictory warnings and take the proper action 100% of the time within four seconds.\n\nThat is about the amount of time that it took you to read this sentence.\n\nBoeing bet nearly everything on those four ticks of the clock. The company\u2019s belief in its engineering, and its reliance on pilots to be flawless cogs, enabled Boeing to speed the latest iteration of its most important airliner to market and ultimately saved money for its customers.\n\nNow, the aerospace giant is sorting through the consequences: two crashes, a global grounding of the MAX fleet, frustrated airlines and the gravest threat to Boeing in its modern history.\n\nThe company is under investigation by federal prosecutors, securities regulators, aviation authorities and lawmakers. It faces more than 100 lawsuits from families of the 346 dead. It may have to further slow or temporarily halt production of the MAX if flight restrictions last much longer. And its troubles are disrupting travel for passengers as well as clouding the outlook for airlines, aerospace suppliers and their tens of thousands of workers.\n\nA Boeing 737 Max 8 in production at Renton, Wash. Photo: gary he/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nInterviews with current and former Boeing employees, pilots, airline officials, federal regulators and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that Boeing repeatedly minimized the risks posed by MCAS, without detailed scrutiny or pushback from U.S. regulators. Engineers assumed pilots would be able to almost instantly counteract an MCAS malfunction, like the ones on the two doomed flights, by executing a long-established emergency procedure for a similar problem.\n\nThe assumptions dovetailed with a vital company goal. To make the plane as inexpensive as possible for airlines to adopt, Boeing was intent on persuading regulators that pilots of earlier 737s should be allowed to start flying the MAX without simulator training. That training would have been required if there were substantial safety differences between the models, boosting the plane\u2019s cost to airlines since training cuts into time flying paying passengers.\n\n\u201cOur marching orders are no training impact on this airplane. Period,\u201d Richard Reed, a former Federal Aviation Administration engineer, recalled a senior Boeing official telling him during a meeting in the early years of the MAX\u2019s development.\n\nThe company had promised its biggest customer for the MAX, Southwest Airlines Co. , that it would pay it $1 million per plane ordered if pilots needed to do additional simulator training, according to Rick Ludtke, a Boeing engineer who worked on the jet\u2019s cockpit systems, and another person who had been involved in the airplane\u2019s development.\n\nA Boeing spokesman said the design and certification of MCAS, including reliance on pilots as the ultimate safety net, were part of a methodical six-year effort that followed accepted industry practices. He also said overall approval of the MAX met \u201cstringent standards and requirements\u201d set by federal regulators.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to learn from the reviews and the lessons from these accidents to continue improving safety,\u201d the spokesman said, citing the continuing investigations.\n\nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg (lower left) joining test pilots for an April flight of updated MCAS software on a 737 MAX 7.

It will also turn on safety alerts that had operated in only a small number of the planes and make emergency procedures no longer dependent upon textbook pilot reactions.\n\nThe FAA is reassessing some of its key assumptions. The agency said certification procedures are \u201cwell-established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs,\u201d but it is rethinking reliance on average U.S. pilot reaction times as a design benchmark for planes that are sold in parts of the world with different experience levels and training standards.\n\nRelated Video Two crashes and the global grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX commercial airliner led to extensive disruption in the international aerospace industry. WSJ\u2019s Robert Wall explains the continuing effects of the plane\u2019s grounding. Photo: Getty Images\n\nBoeing began developing the MAX in 2011 as bitter rival Airbus SE began making inroads with its A320neo. Boeing, needing a fuel-efficient single-aisle airliner to avoid losing market share, rushed to lock in deals before its board approved building the jet.\n\nTo use less fuel, the design called for larger engines that would be moved forward and higher than in the previous model. The changes affected how the plane handled, though. Its nose pitched up in certain high-altitude conditions, risking a stall, the term for a sudden loss of force called lift that keeps planes aloft.\n\nEngineers developed MCAS, which stands for Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, to manage that. The system operated behind the scenes, pushing down the plane\u2019s nose by moving the horizontal stabilizer on the tail by small increments of 0.6 degree.\n\nBoeing officials were focused on making the MAX fly as similarly as possible to earlier 737s. The fewer differences, the less likely the FAA would require pilots to undergo retraining.\n\nMr. Ludtke, the former Boeing cockpit engineer, said company managers put pressure on engineers to avoid tweaks in designs that could result in pilots needing to learn new maneuvers in a simulator.\n\nFinancial Fallout The protracted grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX has prevented the aerospace giant from delivering its most popular jet, costing it sales, dragging down profit and shrinking its market value amid competition with rival Airbus.

But the officials, including chief MAX engineer Michael Teal, opted not to work with simulator makers to simultaneously develop a MAX version because they were confident the plane wouldn\u2019t differ much from earlier 737s.\n\n\u201cIt was a high-stakes gamble,\u201d this person said.\n\nThe Boeing spokesman said that as with any new version of an existing airplane, minimizing differences was a goal for the MAX. \u201cBut this design objective was only that\u2014an objective\u2014and was always subordinate to other requirements, including safety.\u201d Boeing always had a plan to help develop a MAX simulator and didn\u2019t delay it out of concerns the FAA might require pilot training, he said.\n\nSome Boeing engineers who worked on the MAX said MCAS wasn\u2019t seen as an important part of the flight-control system. They focused on other functions they deemed to be more critical to safety, such as an auto-landing system.\n\nIn meetings with Boeing officials at an FAA office in the Seattle area around 2013, the plane maker described the system as simply a few lines of software code, according to Mr. Reed, the former FAA engineer who participated in those discussions.\n\nThe company outlined how a single sensor that measured the angle of the plane\u2019s nose would trigger MCAS, Mr. Reed recalled, but argued a failure wasn\u2019t likely and the system would kick in only in extreme conditions.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s quit messing around about the chances of this happening being rare,\u201d Mr. Reed remembered saying. \u201cIf it can happen, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nBoeing assigned MCAS a technical-hazard rating of \u201cmajor\u201d during everyday operations, meaning its failure was unlikely to result in death or the loss of the plane. Multiple sensors aren\u2019t required by the FAA for that designation, on the assumption that the crew could handle any failure. Boeing said another sensor would have added unneeded complexity. Other systems on earlier 737s relied on single sensors, according to former Boeing engineers and others familiar with the designs.\n\nPilots Craig Bomben, left, and Ed Wilson stepping out a Boeing 737 Max in January 2016 after its first flight at Boeing Field in Seattle. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press\n\nThe Boeing spokesman said a single sensor \u201csatisfied all certification and safety requirements,\u201d and potential additional training wasn\u2019t considered when assessing MCAS hazards.\n\nFrom the start, safety-assessment documents Boeing provided to the FAA assumed pilots would be able to handle misfires.\n\nRegulators endorsed that determination, along with the single sensor. The FAA certification rules under which the MAX was allowed to fly assume pilots react correctly to certain emergencies 100% of the time.\n\nAs part of its calculus, Boeing decided it didn\u2019t need to tell cockpit crews about MCAS or how it worked. During early design phases, Boeing referred to the system by name in a draft manual, parts of which were reviewed by the Journal, and explained generally what it was supposed to do. Those references disappeared before it was issued to airlines.\n\nThe company reasoned that pilots had trained for years to deal with a problem known as a runaway stabilizer that also can force the nose of the plane to dip. The correct response to an MCAS misfire was identical. Pilots didn\u2019t need to know why it was happening.\n\nLate in the design process, however, Boeing gave MCAS greater authority. Test pilots for the company and FAA discovered that the MAX\u2019s controls didn\u2019t stiffen as needed during certain lower-speed maneuvers, according to people familiar with the MCAS design. They suggested MCAS be expanded to work at lower speeds so the MAX could meet FAA regulations, which require a plane\u2019s controls to operate smoothly, with steadily increasing amounts of pressure as pilots pull back on the yoke.\n\nTo adjust MCAS for lower speeds, engineers quadrupled the amount the system could repeatedly move the stabilizer, to increments of 2.5 degrees. The changes ended up playing a major role in the Lion Air and Ethiopian crashes.\n\nAfter increasing the system\u2019s potency, though, Boeing didn\u2019t submit a new safety assessment to the FAA, according to people familiar with the matter. While a top FAA pilot knew about the changes, other officials were in the dark and some now say an updated safety assessment could have provided a chance to find problems.\n\nThe system\u2019s evolution and lack of an updated safety assessment were earlier reported by the Seattle Times. The FAA has said Boeing wasn\u2019t required to update the document.\n\nThe assumptions about pilot reaction stayed the same even though a misfire could now lead to a fatal battle between pilot and machine.\n\nThe Boeing spokesman said engineers determined the changes didn\u2019t affect the overall hazard assessment, saying the company briefed the FAA and international regulators on MCAS, including its final configuration, several times.\n\nEthiopian Airlines pilots and crew members attended a service for crash victims at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa in March. Photo: EPA/Shutterstock\n\nThose specifics, including the system\u2019s expanded authority at lower speeds, were mentioned in a letter and in a number of Boeing presentations to FAA officials monitoring the MAX, according to people briefed on the communications. But senior FAA officials in Washington weren\u2019t told, and many others inside the agency continued to depend on Boeing\u2019s initial descriptions of MCAS.\n\nFAA training experts, unaware MCAS had been made more potent, ultimately decided the MAX\u2019s handling characteristics were close enough to those of previous 737s that pilots could learn changes in a few hours on a laptop or tablet. It went into service in 2017.\n\nSouthwest Airlines, the jet\u2019s first and biggest customer, followed Boeing\u2019s lead and deleted MCAS from the manuals and emergency procedures it devised for its pilots. Other carriers didn\u2019t mention it, either.\n\nOn Oct. 28, 2018, an alarm called a stick shaker went off on a Lion Air 737 MAX flight from Denpasar, Indonesia, to Jakarta, causing one of the pilots\u2019 controls to vibrate heavily, warning of an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMCAS pushed down the plane\u2019s nose. Faulty data from a malfunctioning sensor had set off a false-stall alarm and caused MCAS to misfire.\n\nThe puzzled cockpit crew checked a quick reference handbook, running through other emergency steps before successfully regaining control of the plane by executing the checklist for a runaway stabilizer. That turned off MCAS and the crew flew manually for the rest of the trip.\n\nIndonesian aviation officials said the pilots had difficulty finding a solution because they had trouble diagnosing the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s instinct. Not in the book,\u201d said Avirianto, the Transportation Ministry\u2019s director of airworthiness and aircraft operations, who uses one name, like many Indonesians.\n\nThe cockpit crew and mechanics didn\u2019t note the severity of the issue in maintenance logs. The next day, the same aircraft took off from Jakarta as Lion Air Flight 610 with the faulty sensor.\n\nThe flight crew immediately faced the same problem. The nose repeatedly pushed down. The crew counteracted the system some two dozen times, using thumb switches on the controls. But the pilots never ran the full emergency procedure that would have turned off MCAS.\n\nAfter 11 minutes in the air, the crew lost control, and the plane crashed into the sea.\n\nSeveral days after the crash, Kevin Greene, the FAA\u2019s chief engineering test pilot for the MAX, told about a dozen agency officials on a conference call that MCAS was suspected of having played a role in the accident, according to a person familiar with the agency\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s MCAS?\u201d one FAA official asked, according to people familiar with the call. The FAA declined to make Mr. Greene available for comment.\n\nShoes found during a search for victims of the ill-fated Lion Air flight 610, collected at the Jakarta International Container Terminal on Oct. 31, 2018. Photo: BAY ISMOYO/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nAgency officials were surprised to learn documents on file at its Seattle-area office failed to mention how the souped-up version of MCAS worked, according to people familiar with the matter. Those papers described MCAS as having one-fourth the control it now had and made no mention that it fired repeatedly.\n\nAround the same time, an internal FAA assessment determined the brawnier MCAS posed an unreasonably high safety risk, one that could result in a similar malfunction on another MAX within months.\n\nBoeing decided for the first time to detail MCAS\u2019s function in a bulletin to airlines. The manufacturer and the FAA also reminded pilots of the emergency procedure. This was supposed to buy Boeing time to work on a permanent solution: a software fix that would include comparing data from both onboard sensors.\n\nDespite the confusion that enveloped the Lion Air cockpit, FAA leaders still backed Boeing\u2019s reliance on swift, unerring pilot response, according to an FAA official who was part of the deliberations. The company and the FAA assured the public the MAX was meanwhile safe to fly.\n\nIn the weeks after the crash, outside pilots, FAA officials and U.S. safety investigators were brought in to help Boeing engineers recheck their assumptions about pilot response, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSimulator tests revealed that an MCAS misfiring produced more alarms than pilots would see with a typical runaway stabilizer, the person familiar with the FAA response said.\n\nWhat surprised FAA officials, this person said, was a demonstration that showed what happened if pilots failed to take action as expected under Boeing\u2019s design assumptions\u2014more than two MCAS misfires could push the plane\u2019s nose down so much that it became uncontrollable and likely to end in catastrophe.\n\n\u201cIt made us realize that this was pretty serious,\u201d the person said.\n\nStill, the pilots in those simulator sessions responded as expected, people familiar with the results said, executing Boeing\u2019s emergency procedure properly and in time.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2026walked away saying, \u2018There\u2019s a mistake here,\u2019\u201d one of the people familiar with the MCAS design said. Still, the tests left company officials with the feeling: \u201cOK, we see that that is confusing, and somehow we got two flight crews who responded differently than we would have expected.\u201d\n\nThe FAA agreed no urgent changes were required. The MAX fleet kept flying without restrictions or additional pilot training.\n\nHistorically, Boeing\u2019s engineering philosophy has put aviators at the center of every new design\u2014ensuring pilots could override computer commands\u2014while simultaneously embracing automation to reap the safety benefits. The year before the Lion Air crash was the safest world-wide in the history of commercial air travel. U.S. airlines suffered a single passenger fatality over roughly a decade.\n\nFrom 747 jumbo jets in the 1970s through the latest wide-body 777 and 787 models, the concept thrived. Boeing prided itself on building airliners that allowed crews to overcome almost any automated function without having to take extra steps to disable underlying systems. Even as automation helped pilots cope with problems from engine failures on takeoff to excessive speed during landings, they retained ultimate control.\n\nSince the late 1990s, though, U.S. accident investigators have recognized that real-world reactions by pilots don\u2019t always measure up to FAA expectations.\n\n\u201cNo consideration is\u2026given to imperfect human performance,\u201d Benjamin Berman, a former National Transportation Safety Board staffer who investigated the 1994 crash of a USAir 737 near the Pittsburgh airport, argued in a 2003 paper.\n\nFAA rules typically assume \u201cthe human will intervene reliably every time,\u201d Mr. Berman added, calling it \u201can unrealistic assumption for human performance.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, an FAA study of a subset of experienced propeller-plane pilots found that only one out of 26 reacted to a similar stabilizer emergency within four seconds.\n\nA 2008 study for the FAA, one of the most recent, found commercial pilots in simulator tests sometimes became confused when confronted with unfamiliar failures and reiterated that certification standards were unrealistic.\n\nThere are many accidents where \u201cpilots theoretically should have been able to save the day, but they took the wrong action, or no action,\u201d said Tony Lambregts, a retired FAA engineer who studied the interaction between people and machines.\n\nBoeing compounded the problem with the MAX, he said, by initially not notifying pilots MCAS existed. \u201cThe pilots were hopelessly unprepared to deal with that,\u201d Mr. Lambregts said. \u201cThey hadn\u2019t been adequately instructed and trained for it.\u201d\n\nOne thing Boeing failed to account for, pilots and some FAA officials said, is that there are different methods for straightening up a jetliner whose nose is pointed too far down. Some pilots use switches on the controls in different ways, and many may instinctively pull back on the yoke to bring the nose up.\n\nIn earlier 737s, pulling back on the yoke also turned off a different automated flight-control system and allowed the pilots to manually fly. Boeing didn\u2019t tell pilots that the MAX was different: When they pulled back on the controls, the nose could rise, but it didn\u2019t shut off MCAS, which could keep misfiring, pushing the nose down. MCAS\u2019s design required the change, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAs details of the Lion Air crash trickled out, pilots pressed Boeing about why they had been kept in the dark.\n\nIn late November, Boeing officials, including Mike Sinnett, the vice president for product strategy, Craig Bomben, a senior pilot, Allan Smolinski, sales director for the Americas, and John Moloney, director of transportation policy, visited American Airlines\u2019 pilot union in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nThe pilots wanted to know why Boeing had excluded MCAS from their manuals, except for a mention in the glossary, when they were expected to be the ultimate, non-automated backstop for the system.\n\nEthiopian Airlines Captain Yared Getachew fought without success to correct the glide path of Flight 302 on March 10.\n\n\u201cWe are the human element,\u201d Capt. Mike Michaelis, then-chairman of the union\u2019s safety committee, told them, according to a recording.\n\nMr. Sinnett asked the pilots why they needed to know whether MCAS or another problem was pushing down the plane\u2019s nose.\n\n\u201cWe struggle with this,\u201d Mr. Sinnett said. \u201cIf there are three or four or five things that could cause a runaway stabilizer, why do you need to know which one it is before you operate the procedure?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis particular one is masked by so many other distractions,\u201d one pilot responded. \u201cI think it\u2019s very unique.\u201d\n\nWith no mention of MCAS, or the ways it could fail, in the manual, many pilots might have a difficult time coming up with the correct response in an emergency.\n\nFour months after the meeting, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 would prove the point in deadly fashion.\n\nIn warning airlines about MCAS after the Lion Air crash, Boeing and the FAA made note of the alerts that could help diagnose a malfunction, including one alert that was a feature on earlier 737 models, called the \u201cAOA Disagree.\u201d\n\nIt was supposed to tell pilots when the MAX\u2019s two \u201cangle-of-attack\u201d sensors showed different readings. Even though MCAS used data from only one, other onboard systems could compare both and warn pilots.\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that if there are any other associated message like AOA DISAGREE or there is an airspeed difference the runaway stabilizer checklist must be done first before proceeding to the other checklists,\u201d Capt. Theodros Asfaw Tilahun, a management pilot for Ethiopian Airlines, emailed colleagues on Nov. 8, shortly after the Lion Air crash.\n\nTrouble was, that alert feature wasn\u2019t activated on MAX jets operated by Ethiopian and many other airlines. A contractor had made mistakes in software meant to activate them, but Boeing had told only certain airlines.\n\nBoeing, which maintains the alerts aren\u2019t critical safety items, instead billed them as part of an optional package. The Boeing spokesman said Ethiopian didn\u2019t purchase it, noting that one of the plane maker\u2019s bulletins, after the Lion Air crash, indicated the alerts would only work with that package. The airline didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nAmong the recipients of the email about the nonexistent alert was Mr. Getachew, the captain who wrestled with a misfiring MCAS on March 10. During that desperate struggle, the crew turned off MCAS, only to later switch it back on.\n\nAbout five minutes after takeoff, the doomed 737 MAX slammed into the brown earth of a farm near Bishoftu, Ethiopia, at more than 550 miles an hour.\n\nThe crater caused by the March crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.
