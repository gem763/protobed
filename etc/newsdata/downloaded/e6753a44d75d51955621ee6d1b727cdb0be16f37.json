(NEO: CCHW) (OTCQX: CCHWF) (FSE: 3LP) (\u201cColumbia Care\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), one of the largest fully integrated operators in the global medical cannabis industry with licenses across the US and EU, today announced the addition of four new dispensaries with openings in Maryland, Delaware and Florida.\n\nColumbia Care\u2019s facility in Chevy Chase represents the Company\u2019s first dispensary in Maryland, a state with more than 100,000 registered patients and a market projected to reach sales in excess of $200 million by year end 2019. The facility\u2019s proximity to Washington, D.C., Delaware, Virginia and Pennsylvania, all markets where Columbia Care operates, allows it to serve as one of the cornerstones for the Company\u2019s mid-Atlantic strategy.\n\nColumbia Care also opened its second dispensary in Delaware, located in Wilmington. With approximately 9,000 patients expected to be registered in the state\u2019s medical program in 2019, Delaware lawmakers are expected to introduce adult use legislation in 2020, which could significantly increase patient access as well as the size of the total addressable market.\n\nFinally, the Company has added two more dispensaries in Florida with the opening of its Sarasota and Jacksonville facilities, bringing the total number of dispensaries open in the state to three. With over 375,000 registered patients, Florida remains one of the largest medical cannabis markets in the world.\n\n\u201cNo debt and a significant cash position gives Columbia Care one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry with access to the growth capital required to fund our 2019 strategic plan to operationalize all of our existing licenses,\u201d said Nicholas Vita, chief executive officer of Columbia Care. \u201cWe are proud to execute on the plan we previously described to our investors, and by leveraging this strong foundation, we look forward to reaping the benefits of having one of the largest organically developed national cannabis platforms in the US. Opening these four additional dispensaries in key markets across the country represents significant progress and points to an accelerated pace of activity as we near the completion of this transformational year.\u201d\n\nThe Company will offer the CNC Card, the nation\u2019s first legal credit card for cannabis purchases, at each of these new locations. In addition, subject to regulatory approval, the company also intends to offer its proprietary home delivery service, \u201cCC@Home,\u201d which, together with the CNC Card, is designed to provide a convenient and comfortable guest experience as well as improved access to high-quality cannabis products capable of addressing a range of unmet health and wellness needs.\n\nFor more information about the Chevy Chase, Sarasota, Jacksonville and Wilmington dispensaries, including a menu of available products and hours of operation, please visit https://col-care.com/all-locations/.\n\nAdditional information on the CNC Card can be found at www.columbianationalcredit.com/.\n\nAbout Columbia Care Inc.\n\nColumbia Care Inc. is one of the largest and most experienced multi-state operators in the medical cannabis industry, with licenses in 15 jurisdictions in the US and the EU.
