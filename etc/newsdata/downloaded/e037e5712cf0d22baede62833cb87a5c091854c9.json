Musk claims the new Tesla TSLA, +1.76% electric pickup truck, dubbed \u201cModel P,\u201d will be \u201cbetter\u201d than the best-selling Ford F, +0.55% F-150 \u201cin terms of truck-like functionality, and \u2026 a better sports car than a standard [Porsche] 911.\u201d (Porsche, which is coming out with a Tesla Model S challenger, is a subsidiary of Volkswagen VWAGY, +0.14% VLKAF, +0.64%. )\n\nDetails about the pickup are still scarce, including the design. In an interview with Recode, Musk said the vehicle would have a \u201creally futuristic-like cyberpunk \u2018Blade Runner\u2019 design.\u201d A couple of 3-D design sketches are currently available online, the most prominent of which is the one made by Tesla, though there\u2019s another created by independent professional automotive designer Emre Husmen.\n\nWhile Tesla\u2019s own concept was shown in June 2018, there\u2019s a good chance the final product won\u2019t stray far from the original. When I first saw Husmen\u2019s design, I fell in love with the Model P, even though I don\u2019t need a pickup. Seeing the original Tesla sketch made me less enthused. Even Musk acknowledged that a \u201cBlade Runner-inspired\u201d form might not appeal to a wide audience \u2014 the traditional truck crowd, in particular.\n\n\u2018Crazy torque\u2019\n\nWhile the pickup may not end up as good looking as it could be, maybe it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. If Musk\u2019s statements are any indication, and he usually doesn\u2019t overestimate vehicle capabilities, the truck should be able to outmatch the 2017 Porsche 911 Carrera, which can go from 0-60 miles per hour in under 4 seconds. And the Tesla pickup may be capable of towing 300,000 pounds, many multiples that of a Ford F-150. In fact, Tesla\u2019s sketch shows a small F-150 loaded in the bed of Model P. The the pickup could take six passengers on a 400- 500-mile trip, and although Musk says this number might even be higher, it is reasonable to estimate that once the pickup gets fully loaded, its range will be reduced.\n\nIt has been announced that the Model P will be powered by a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system, with \u201ccrazy torque,\u201d according to Musk, and will have a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. The truck will also feature sonar, a 360-degree camera and automatic parallel parking, all of which will be powered by a high-voltage lithium-ion battery. Power outlets on the vehicle will be provide juice to \u201chigh-power tools in field all day. No generator needed,\u201d Musk said in a tweet.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the price. In Musk\u2019s own words: \u201cYou should be able to buy a really great truck for $49K or less.\u201d\n\nWhile those are all the details we have so far, more will undoubtedly surface as the reveal date approaches.\n\nDown on the farm\n\nThe main problem for Tesla is the reception from its target audience: truck owners, farmers and technicians (among others). Unlike tech enthusiasts, they value utility and durability far more than gimmicks, sonar and cameras, and if Tesla\u2019s pickup won\u2019t be able to outperform what they can already do with conventional trucks, they will be unlikely to switch. An average American farmer would want a truck that\u2019s not only powerful, but also easy to repair (preferably on-site) and modular enough to be adapted to various workloads and scenarios. It remains to be seen if Tesla will be able to answer these challenges once the model is unveiled.\n\nWhat do you think about Tesla\u2019s pickup? Are there any features you\u2019d like it to have?
