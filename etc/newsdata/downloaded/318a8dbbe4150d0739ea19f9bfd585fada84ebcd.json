Zuberi was the only individual named in the subpoena. Then, in April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Zuberi was involved in a second federal probe in Los Angeles where prosecutors were scrutinizing his relationships with foreign nations.\n\nProsecutors in California now allege that under the guise of his firm, Avenue Ventures, Zuberi \u201csolicited foreign nations and representatives of foreign governments\u201d with claims he could change U.S. foreign policy with his \u201cinfluence in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nHis clients, according to the the criminal information, gave him money for consulting work, investments, and to fund various campaigns. Zuberi then allegedly used the money to hire lobbyists and make campaign contributions\u2014\u201dwhich gave him access to high-level U.S. officials, some of whom took action in support of his clients,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\n\u201cAs evidence of his access and influence, Zuberi distributed to his clients photographs of himself discussing policy with elected officials,\u201d the court documents allege.\n\nAccording to the criminal information, Zuberi allegedly used the money to mount several lobbyist efforts, including trying to convince the government of Bahrain to lift sanctions on one of its citizens in order to allow the development of a large resort to move forward.\n\nIn 2014, Zuberi also secured a contract with the government of Sri Lanka to help \u201crehabilitate\u201d the country\u2019s image in the U.S., prosecutors allege.\n\nSri Lanka allegedly agreed to pay Zuberi $8.5 million for the project, which included lobbying efforts, legal expenses, and a media campaign. Days after the country made an initial payment of $3.5 million, the 49-year-old allegedly transferred almost half into his \u201cpersonal brokerage account and used another $1.5 million to purchase real estate.\u201d\n\nOf the $6.5 million Sri Lanka paid for a rehabilitation campaign, Zuberi allegedly used less than $850,000 on the actual project\u2014telling some subcontractors the country \u201chad not provided sufficient funds to pay invoices,\u201d court documents state.\n\nIn his plea agreement with prosecutors, Zuberi admitted to filing a false 2014 tax return that hid the millions he received from Sri Lanka over the course of four years.\n\nProsecutors noted that while \u201csome U.S. officials were willing to take action on issues\u201d Zuberi pushed, most of his business efforts were unsuccessful and his clients, consultants, and other lobbyists \u201csuffered significant losses.\u201d\n\nZuberi repeatedly misrepresented his influence and use of his clients\u2019 funds, much of which was ultimately used for his \u201cown personal benefit,\u201d according to the criminal information.\n\nThroughout his scheme, Zuberi also allegedly made dozens of illegal campaign contributions\u2014and pocketed more than $1.1 million from two foreign companies that was meant to fund political campaigns. Zuberi has admitted that from 2012 to 2016, he \u201cmade or solicited more than $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\n\u201cAmerican influence is not for sale,\u201d said Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office. \u201cMr. Zuberi lured individuals who were seeking political influence in violation of U.S. law, and in the process, enriched himself by defrauding those with whom he interacted.\u201d\n\nZuberi faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison once he pleads guilty to the charges.\n\nThe Daily Beast has previously reported that Zuberi had contact with Trump\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen, in 2016 and 2017. Sources familiar with the matter said Zuberi initially spoke with Cohen about his plans to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017 and inquired about access to high-level events. Zuberi had been told that he would need to pay upward of $1 million to attend the events, where he would rub shoulders with senior administration officials including President-elect Trump himself.\n\nZuberi spoke with Cohen before and after the inauguration about potential business opportunities the two could embark upon during a Trump administration, according to two sources with knowledge of the conversations. According to those sources, Cohen asked Zuberi to be included as a lawyer on a Manhattan real-estate project. One individual said that deal never went forward.\n\nAfter his donation, Zuberi earned the spot of helping sponsor the Global Chairman\u2019s Dinner, an event at the inauguration where foreign individuals and representatives can mingle with one another. During this time period, he also worked to help host a breakfast at the Trump Hotel in Washington that included foreign officials from Qatar and Kazakhstan and Trumpworld figures like former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA).\n\nZuberi\u2019s name appears on a document that shows a potential guest list for the breakfast that includes the names of foreign officials. Zuberi is listed as a \u201csource\u201d for those officials on the list. Zuberi\u2019s attorney has previously said that Zuberi did not invite anybody to the breakfast.", "description": "Imaad Zuberi, who donated $900,000 to Trump\u2019s Inaugural Committee, will plead guilty to faking records to hide his work as a foreign agent while lobbying U.S. officials.", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "Pilar Melendez", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571776592/191022-Pilar-Zuberi-indictment-tease_acklhx", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
