The Douglass Community Land Trust is working to acquire the complex in a way that will keep the housing affordable to low-income residents even as the surrounding neighborhood gentrifies . (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nFor decades, the District\u2019s fight against the economic and social forces of gentrification has been a rearguard action: Belated restrictions on development, overdue attention to the needs of working-class families, modest affordable housing complexes tucked into neighborhoods where rent has already skyrocketed.\n\nBut a new initiative taking shape east of the Anacostia River aims to take a different approach. A non-profit is buying property in a way that insulates it from development pressure, creating islands of affordability for longtime Washingtonians and girding against gentrification before the process begins.\n\nThe Douglass Community Land Trust, incorporated this month after years of planning and neighborhood outreach, will bring an increasingly popular approach to preserving affordable housing to the nation\u2019s capital, which according to a recent study has experienced the country\u2019s most intense rate of gentrification.\n\nWhile it has ambitions to expand citywide, the land trust\u2019s initial focus is on neighborhoods in Southeast where full-scale redevelopment, and the accompanying displacement of longtime residents, still seems like relatively distant prospects.\n\nDouglass Community Land Trust \u2014 named after Anacostia\u2019s most famous resident, the 19th century abolitionist and orator Frederick Douglass \u2014 is finalizing the acquisition of its first property, the 65-unit Savannah Apartments in Congress Heights.\n\n\u201cWe have a chance now, east of the river and other places that haven\u2019t yet experienced that kind of hyper-development that displaces folks, to create a plan,\u201d said executive director Ginger Rumph.\n\nThat plan builds on a model that has been implemented across the country. Land trusts have been set up in very different places, from dense Eastern cities to coastal California farmland, with the common goal of preserving buildings or land that would otherwise be obliterated by the unfettered real-estate market.\n\n[Bowser and D.C. Council offer competing visions on affordable housing]\n\nIn their modern form, urban housing land trusts often operate through a model called shared equity housing. The trust buys and holds the deed to land beneath a building, leasing it back to a homeowner or developer, who owns the buildings.\n\nSeparating the land from the purchase price, in addition to other financial contributions made by the land trust, brings the home within the buying power of people with lower incomes \u2014 or, in the case of an apartment complex, makes it more economically feasible for a landlord to keep rents affordable.\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 22: A portion of Savannah Apartments is seen on Sunday September 22, 2019 in Washington, DC.

That allows individual homeowners to reap some of the benefits of their investment while keeping the property affordable for future occupants.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) put a spotlight on community land trusts when he included a proposed $50 billion to fund them in the housing plan released by his presidential campaign. Sanders championed one of the nation\u2019s earlier and most successful land trusts as mayor of Burlington in the 1980s.\n\nBut the model dates back further: The first community land trust was founded in rural Georgia during the civil rights era to protect the livelihoods of sharecroppers, said Tony Pickett, chief executive of Grounded Solutions, a national network of land trusts.\n\nPickett said the trusts are becoming increasingly popular in cities with high rents and home prices, and have an advantage over conventional affordable housing projects, which often revert to market rates after a set period elapses.\n\nBy contrast, land trusts keep housing affordable indefinitely. They hold particular promise, Pickett said, in areas where rising rents and development pressure can be foreseen, perhaps as the result of new parks, trails or public transit extensions.\n\nIn Atlanta, for example, a land trust has sprung up to offset the effects of the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop of trails, parks and public transportation that is expected to drive up property values in some of the city\u2019s historically African American neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cIf we get in early enough, during the planning stages, before infrastructure improvements are implemented, maybe we can stem some of this displacement activity that occurs,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the District, too, the idea for a community land trust grew out of a looming project that inspires mixed feelings.\n\n\n\nAn artist\u2019s rendition of the planned 11th Street Bridge Park, connecting Anacostia with Navy Yard across the Anacostia River. The elevated park, similar to New York City\u2019s High Line, is designed to provide recreational and cultural space Residents east of the river are concerned that it will increase development pressure and result in rising rents and displacement. (OMA + OLIN)\n\nThat project is the 11th Street Bridge Park, an elevated public park, similar to New York City\u2019s High Line, that is planned the pilings of the old road bridge that once connected Navy Yard and Anacostia. The park will span the Anacostia River and feature paths for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as ample park space and entertainment venues.\n\nThe projected construction, planning and permitting costs for the bridge, currently scheduled to open in 2023, will be approximately $74 million, some $38 million of which has been committed by the city. The rest is expected to come from private donors and through federal tax credits.\n\nSoutheast residents contemplate the project with both hope and suspicion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive,\u201d said Walter Riley, a public school teacher in Maryland who lives across the street from the Anacostia Metro station. \u201cIt also feels like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re building something for the new residents of the community.\u2019\u201d\n\nKymone Freeman, managing partner of We Act Radio, an independent station that operates within view of the proposed bridge park site on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE, said he wasn\u2019t initially inclined to welcome the project.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I thought that it was an immediate threat to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI was against the idea originally, because it was going to usher in gentrification.\u201d\n\nThat changed, Freeman said, after repeated conversations with Scott Kratz, the project\u2019s director. Out of those conversations grew the idea for the Douglass Community Land Trust, Freeman said, and his own willingness to support the bridge park.\n\n\u201cActivists... often we\u2019re very good at saying what we\u2019re against, and not very good at saying what we\u2019re for,\u201d Freeman said. He ultimately agreed to be one of the organization\u2019s founding board members, fulfilling another tenet of land trusts, where community members typically make up at least one third of the governing board.\n\nKratz said bridge park organizers have held more than 1,000 community meetings, and are undertaking various initiatives to dampen the potential effects of gentrification that could flow east of the river when the park connects Anacostia, one of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, to Navy Yard, one of its hottest redeveloped areas.\n\nBut the land trust\u2019s activities have special urgency, he said.\n\n[Should cities subsidize housing for families making up to $141,000?]\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just an idea on paper,\u201d Kratz said. \u201cThe property values in Congress Heights are already going up. The property values in Deanwood are already going up.\u201d More and more of those sales are cash-only transactions involving limited liability corporations, Kratz said, a harbinger of real-estate speculation and impending development.\n\nAt the Savannah Apartments in Congress Heights, tenants board association vice president Tiffany Jessup says those pressures can be felt.\n\nBlocks from the scenes of shootings this summer and dominated by low-slung brick housing complexes, the area seems remote from the prosperity that has washed over neighborhoods west of the river.\n\nBut change is already apparent for those who pay close attention, Jessup said as she walked in front of her building on a recent Sunday morning. While it is a few miles from the site of the planned 11th Street Bridge Park, the complex is a block from both the Congress Heights Metro station and the campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital, which is slated for extensive redevelopment.\n\n\u201cLook at that white building,\u201d she said, pointing to a structure down the road that showed signs of recent rehabbing. \u201cCondos are being built everywhere. It was inevitable that someone was going to come and try to get this property and do whatever they want with it.\u201d\n\nBut the inevitable hasn\u2019t happened yet. A few years ago, after getting wind of an impending sale, Jessup, 48 \u2014 who grew up down the street \u2014 said she and other tenants exercised their rights under D.C.\u2019s Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which allows renters to make their landlord a competing offer before an impending sale.\n\nAt Savannah, the tenants joined with the nonprofit National Housing Trust, which purchased the property for approximately $7 million last year and is currently seeking financing for renovations. The Douglass Community Land Trust, which is contributing $1.3 million to the project, will hold the deed to the land beneath the buildings, with the goal of keeping the rental units permanently affordable.\n\nMost units will be reserved for people making up to 50 percent of local median income, or about $61,000 per year for a four-person household. It would be the land trust\u2019s first property.\n\nJessup said the deal would help her \u2014 and her parents, who have lived in the complex for 26 years \u2014 \u201cbe able to stay in a place that we have called home.\u201d\n\nLike Freeman, Jessup has joined the board of the community land trust. She said she hopes the building\u2014 which she said is being renamed the Savannah Preservation Apartments to reflect its new status as dedicated affordable housing \u2014 will pave the way for other homes to be kept affordable through the land trust.\n\nBut in a part of Washington where well-intentioned efforts have gone awry in the past, it will take time to see whether promises are matched by results, Jessup said.\n\n\u201cWe would be their first, good and bad,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess we would be the guinea pigs.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nShe and her twin were inseparable.
