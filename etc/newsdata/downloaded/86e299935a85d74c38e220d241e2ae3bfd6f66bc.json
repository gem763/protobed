Photo: Miikka Skaffari/FilmMagic\n\nWhat would a Ken Burns documentary be without its measured, authoritative narration? In The West, The National Parks, Prohibition, The Dust Bowl, The Roosevelts, The Vietnam War, The Mayo Clinic, and now Country Music, actor Peter Coyote delivers hours of often dense, complex text \u2014 full of facts, figures, quotes, and grand unifying ideas \u2014 in a manner that Burns refers to as \u201cGod\u2019s stenographer.\u201d His calm, cowboy-around-a-campfire timbre is basically the voice of America, at least within the orbit of PBS.\n\nGenerations of kids first met Coyote as the embodiment of authority \u2014 he played Keys, the head scientist in E.T. the Extra Terrestrial \u2014 but the man himself has lived a Zelig-like life. Growing up as a secular Jew with communist relatives during the McCarthy era, Coyote was an early convert to political activism and the counterculture. \u201cI saw grown-ups weeping in my living room,\u201d he says. \u201cMen and women who were broken by lies the government was telling.\u201d As a young man, he was invited into Kennedy\u2019s White House after staging a protest against nuclear testing during the Cuban missile crisis, threw himself headlong into a decade of drugs, Hell\u2019s Angels, and commune living, narrowly escaped being drafted to Vietnam by pretending to be a cold-blooded marauder, helped run the California State Arts Council for eight years, and then decided to become an actor. These days, he\u2019s also an ordained Zen Buddhist priest.\n\nCoyote has lent his voice to a plethora of ads and documentaries over the decades, but his decades-long relationship with Burns is something special. Vulture spoke with both men about Coyote\u2019s unequaled voice, their unique recording process, and how they handle political disagreements.\n\nPeter, how did you get into the narration game?\n\nPeter Coyote: I was broke after ten years in the counterculture and I needed a way to make some money. I wasn\u2019t an actor at that time, so I made a comedic CD of myself talking in about 15 different accents, telling people how unreliable and unhirable this guy Peter Coyote was. I walked it around to every ad agency in San Francisco and I started getting work for ads. I got my first Screen Actors Guild card in 1979, and by 1980 I was making five-digit money. After E.T. and Jagged Edge and Outrageous Fortune, I did a lot of ads \u2014 General Motors, Chevy, Cadillac, Tylenol, New York Life. Then I did a great movie for Alex Gibney, comparing American labor practices to Japanese labor practices. That may have been one of the first documentaries that really synced totally with my politics and my ideas. I don\u2019t know in what year it was that I did The West [Editor\u2019s note: It was 1996], but that began my relationship with Ken.\n\nKen, is it project-specific when you choose to use Peter?\n\nKen Burns: Yes it is. I would ask him for every project except those that are subject-wise African-American. There\u2019s a process: We would prefer that Peter not see the script and he prefers not to see the script. And we do not run the film while we\u2019re recording. We get about 95 percent of the way through editing, and then we say, \u201cTime for Peter.\u201d An episode might run an hour and 50 minutes. Peter reads it cold. And more often than you could possibly believe, that first take is often terrific. It\u2019s usually two, three takes. I\u2019m sure it now drives him insane. I always say, \u201cPerfect. One more for the insurance company.\u201d\n\nIs it more than just an easy paycheck?\n\nPeter Coyote: Nobody does a documentary to get rich. They do it because they really care about it. There are a number of them I do for free, because I want to help the idea get currency. There are some of them I do because it\u2019s like a master\u2019s degree in a subject. And then Ken\u2019s really stand above and apart like a Ph.D. in the subject. The challenge of taking the reader through complex sentences, with lots of clauses and subclauses, is something I have an idiot savant\u2019s talent to be able to do. I have a very wide peripheral vision. I can see when a comma is coming, I can see when a period is coming and I have to dismount. I understand what I\u2019m reading \u2014 fully. Very often, we\u2019ll stop and have discussions about something in the text, or I\u2019ll tell him some little historical piece of relevance that I\u2019ve uncovered.\n\nKen Burns: He feels like Zelig. There\u2019s rarely been a project that, when we\u2019re taking a break or between sessions, he doesn\u2019t regale us with stories of the people that our film is about, or experiences that he had in a national park, or stuff that he did during the Vietnam War. I mean, he\u2019s the intersection of the second half of the 20th century and American culture and life.\n\nPeter Coyote as \u201cKeys\u201d in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Photo: Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nWhen you work with Peter, are you just looking for his natural speaking voice, or do you ask him for a certain tone?\n\nKen Burns: We want him to be \u201cGod\u2019s stenographer,\u201d as [late NBC Nightly News anchor] John Chancellor told me after I\u2019d spent an hour or so breaking his very understandable broadcast [habits]. He was our narrator of Baseball back in the early \u201990s. After a while he said, \u201cOh, you want me to God\u2019s stenographer?\u201d I cracked up and I said, \u201cYes, John, that\u2019s exactly it.\u201d It\u2019s not soft-spoken. It\u2019s not damped-down. It has all the meaning. All of the import, none of the ego.\n\nHow much of voice-over work is performance? Is it more than simply reading in a compelling way?\n\nPeter Coyote: No, I don\u2019t think it is. As a matter of fact, the only area where Ken and I have any kind of instinctive difference is my people are Jews and we\u2019re minor key people. Ken is not. He wants zero performance. But, of course, he also wants me to reflect the gravity of the text when it\u2019s grave, or catch an ironic note when it\u2019s there. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing a performance. I always do them cold. I never read the scripts in advance.\n\nI can see the value in getting a gut reaction.\n\nPeter Coyote: It\u2019s like Allen Ginsberg said, \u201cFirst thought, best thought.\u201d The first time I read the text, I have the most vivid images. Those images actually control my voice. I\u2019m not manipulating. It\u2019s not my ego or my small mind. It\u2019s fealty to the images.\n\nYour narration is gentle but authoritative, which is really interesting, since this is your first encounter with the script.\n\nPeter Coyote: It\u2019s because I\u2019m completely assured about what\u2019s going on in my mental and emotional life. I\u2019m not reading the text and consciously translating it and saying, \u201cHow can I reflect this in my tonality and my emotion?\u201d As I\u2019m reading, each sentence is just creating an image. I\u2019m not trying for an effect. My voice is automatically responding to the images in my brain or in my body.\n\nDo you ever get emotional?\n\nPeter Coyote: Sometimes. I grew up in a family with a lot of socialists and some communists and people who dedicated their lives to the common good, so when I was reading Roosevelt and watching the New Deal come into place, I was quite moved. But when I got to Vietnam, which was something I was intimately engaged with, it was very hard not to let rage or disgust creep out. When you read, \u201cFive presidents knew the war was unwinnable and couldn\u2019t find a way to get out and save face, and so they let 50,000 [U.S. soldiers] die and 3 million Asians die \u2026\u201d I mean, those are words I would like to spit. But if I do that, then I\u2019m putting my foot in the small of your back and I\u2019m taking your reaction away from you. My discipline is to harness my own feelings, so that you have free rein to yours.\n\nYou\u2019re attempting to be as dispassionate as possible?\n\nPeter Coyote: I\u2019m attempting to be as transparent as possible. I don\u2019t want you to pay attention to the beautiful quality of my voice, or my articulation, or anything like that. I want to just be there to serve that film. Really, man, I\u2019m a Jew with an animal name who reads good. These guys have been out there for years working, fact-checking, thinking. And there are many ways in which I\u2019m far to the left of Ken. The Vietnam series began by saying: \u201cThe war was begun by good people for good motives and went bad.\u201d My leftie friends went ballistic. \u201cGood people? They\u2019re fascist bastards! How can you do that?\u201d And my rejoinder was: \u201cThere are about six or seven truly radical analyses of Vietnam in documentary film, and both people who saw them loved them. But Ken Burns got the entire country to sit around and learn that five presidents lied to them, that generals lied to them, we invaded a sovereign country, and we killed 3 million people.\u201d If I had come in with \u201cThe fascist bastards started their war \u2026\u201d the majority would have changed the channel. I\u2019d like [Ken] to hit harder sometimes. But he\u2019s the master. And in fairness, he gets the Koch brothers to pay for it.\n\nKen, it\u2019s not just the volume of words you give him, right? It\u2019s the density and complexity and pronunciations.\n\nKen Burns: We have phonetic guides for me, as a scratch narrator, and for him. More often than not, he knows in advance how to pronounce something. Sometimes we\u2019ll decide how French you want to be in a pronunciation, how Spanish you want to be, how local you want to be. Are we going to say \u201chollos\u201d or \u201chollers\u201d in Country Music? \u201cMissoura\u201d or \u201cMissouri\u201d? These are our big, huge questions. We\u2019re often finding that one reading of his might be longer than mine. We\u2019ll either open him up \u2014 that is to say, insert space between phrases and breaths \u2014 or we\u2019ll cut the picture differently.\n\nThat reminds me of Steven Spielberg recutting the E.T. finale to fit John Williams\u2019s music.\n\nKen Burns: In the case of Williams, who\u2019s such a gifted composer in his own right, the integrity of the original composition is so intense that you\u2019re a fool, as a filmmaker, if you don\u2019t surf that wave. Why would you have him adjust it when it\u2019s the most beautiful wave? You\u2019ve just got to get back on your surfboard. In Country Music, Merle Haggard said, \u201cIt\u2019s like things that we believe in and can\u2019t see, like dreams and songs and souls.\u201d And later on, Wynton says, \u201cMusic is the only art form that\u2019s invisible.\u201d So why not take advantage of, in this case, the music of that narrator?\n\nIt seems like he\u2019s the voice of America for you.\n\nKen Burns: I\u2019ve always looked for a voice \u2014 quite frankly, and there\u2019s no ego involved in this \u2014 that\u2019s close to my voice. Not in timbre, not in sound, but in meaning. And no one has come closer to my voice in meaning than Peter. No one.\n\nPeter, you\u2019re a pretty political person. What was the initial spark that made you that way?\n\nPeter Coyote: Growing up in the \u201940s and the \u201950s, my family were secular Jews. We couldn\u2019t join the country club a block from our house. I never got over the fact that I\u2019d be playing with my friends and they\u2019d say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s go swimming!\u201d and I couldn\u2019t go. No one ever said, \u201cWait, why don\u2019t we do something that Pete can do?\u201d So there\u2019s a lesson in politics right there. Then, in the McCarthy period, my mother\u2019s cousin was the first man fired from the New York City school system for being a communist. I saw grown-ups weeping in my living room, men and women who were broken by lies the government was telling. Then came the civil-rights movement, and here were these well-dressed, well-spoken African-Americans being set on by dogs and firehoses and white peckerwood mouth-breathers for trying to have a crappy sandwich at the Woolworth\u2019s. When you looked at that, you had to take a side. If you didn\u2019t take a side, you were taking a side. And then I was involved with a protest that went outside the White House, called the Grinnell 14 \u2014 first [protest] group in history that was ever invited in the White House. So I began to experience what a few people could do by making a commitment, by being well-mannered, well-spoken, knowing their song before they started singing. I\u2019ve never wanted to disenfranchise myself since.\n\nHow has all of that shaped you as an actor, or as a storyteller?\n\nPeter Coyote: I think of myself as a writer who makes his living as an actor \u2014 or who made his living, because I\u2019m sort of retired. By the time I started acting, I had a family and I had real economic pressures on me. I didn\u2019t feel like I had the leeway to do what I would have liked to do, which would be to go to the London Academy of Dramatic Arts, which turns out the greatest English-speaking actors on Earth. My inability to get that training left me with certain insecurities. I was not always as bold as I should have been because of that, and I really didn\u2019t seek out challenges because of that. I also had the idea, not to make an excuse, but I better make my offstage life my first priority. So I did, and I paid a tax on my career for that. I\u2019m extremely grateful for having done 160 films and working with great directors like Polanski and Walter Hill and Steven Spielberg and Pedro Almod\u00f3var. But it was never the source of my joy and fulfillment. That\u2019s just the truth. One felt authentic, and one didn\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019re also an ordained Buddhist priest. How does that affect the way you respond to the conditions of the world?\n\nPeter Coyote: It complicates it. The core truth of Buddhism is that everything is interdependent. There\u2019s no \u201cyou\u201d without sunlight, without oxygen, without water, without microbes in the soil that grow your food, without pollinating insects that help it, without birds to eat the pests. So the biggest thing that I learned \u2014 that served me first in politics with [California governor] Jerry Brown \u2014 was that I\u2019m made of the same stuff as the people I abhor, or whose behavior I abhor. I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m this pure, wonderful warrior with no negative human potentiality, but I\u2019m made of the same stuff as Hitler and Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan. So when I speak to people, I have to do it without being judgmental. We\u2019re the same animal. That, to me, is a very Buddhist way of looking at things: to strive for the fact that I have shadows, I have anger, I have jealousy, I have envy, I have greed. I have everything that my opponent does. My job as a priest, certainly, but as any Buddhist, is to monitor my internal life to make sure it doesn\u2019t leak. When you do that, and when you fix your intention on compassion with the force of habit, then you can trust yourself to be spontaneous without worrying about what\u2019s going to come out. I have a lot of trouble with people in my own political persuasions, because they like to pretend that they\u2019re all good and all the evil is out there. They\u2019re screaming at people for peace and they don\u2019t see the contradiction.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed from separate conversations with Peter Coyote and Ken Burns.", "description": "If you\u2019ve ever been entranced by the narration of a Ken Burns documentary like Country Music, you have Peter Coyote to thank.
