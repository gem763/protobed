REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo REUTERS\n\nFor frequent flyers boarding Lion Air 610, the interior of the Boeing 737 Max looked the same as earlier editions. But aerodynamically the 737 Max is significantly different.\n\nThe Max has much larger engines, improving the fuel efficiency of the aircraft. But the undercarriage of the Boeing 737 is short, and it sits much lower on the ground than its more modern counterpart, the Airbus A320.\n\nHad the latest large engines been hung from the wings, as on previous versions, there would have been insufficient ground clearance.\n\nInstead, the engines were moved further forward and blended into each wing. While intuitively this sounds as though it should have made the aircraft \u201cnose-heavy\u201d, in fact the aerodynamic consequence was that the engine housing themselves generated lift and could tilt the aircraft upwards.\n\nThe designers concluded this characteristic increased the risk of a stall, in which the wings do not generate sufficient lift to keep the plane flying safely.\n\nSo they installed software called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).\n\nThe anti-stall system monitors the angle between the wing and the airflow, known as the \u201cangle of attack\u201d. This is measured by a vane on the outside of the aircraft. If the system detects that the angle is getting dangerously steep, it operates an elevator in the tail to nudge the nose downwards \u2013 and does so repeatedly, even overriding the pilots\u2019 commands.\n\nIt was installed, says Boeing, \u201cto enhance the pitch stability of the airplane \u2013 so that it feels and flies like other 737s\u201d.\n\nThe Indonesian accident report spells out: \u201cMCAS was needed in order to make the Boeing 737 Max handling characteristics so similar to the [previous] versions that no simulator training was needed for type rating.\u201d\n\nAs airlines updated their fleets, a more economical version of an old favourite, with no additional training required, was an appealing prospect.\n\nBut the Indonesian accident report, published almost a year after the tragedy, revealed that a faulty sensor caused MCAS to intervene repeatedly to force the nose of the aircraft down \u2013 even as the plane was falling at 10,000 feet per minute.\n\nNine days after the crash, the US safety regulator took action. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive about MCAS, saying its erroneous deployment \u201ccould cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain\u201d.\n\nBut four months later, another 157 people lost their lives in a similar accident. The pilots of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi were aware of the possible problem. But when MCAS was triggered, again because of a faulty sensor, they could not overcome the pressure with which the system forced down the nose of their Boeing 737 Max.\n\nWithin days, all Max aircraft were grounded worldwide. In total, 387 of the plane type had been delivered to 48 airlines since the plane entered service in May 2017.\n\nFor passengers, flight crew and airlines, there are three crucial questions. When will the Max fly again? What will be different about it? And how will readily will travellers step aboard the jet?\n\nBoeing assumes the Boeing 737 Max will be approved to fly again by the end of the year. It says: \u201cThis assumption reflects our best estimate at this time, but actual timing of return to service could differ from this estimate.\u201d\n\nBut Sean Broderick, senior air transport and safety editor for Aviation Week, warns that even if the plane is given the green light, it will be \u201clate winter or early spring\u201d before it is back in commercial service.\n\n\u201cThe best guess right now \u2013 and it is a guess \u2013 is that the US FAA and likely a few other regulators will clear the Max to return sometime in December,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRegulators are still awaiting some final bits from Boeing to round out the entire package, which includes software updates and documentation.\n\n\u201cThe changes have to be flight-tested by regulators and some airline pilots, and training also must be finalised.\n\n\u201cDelays in any of this, or discovery of any other issues during final testing could push initial approvals into 2020.\u201d\n\nBut Tim Jeans, former managing director of Monarch Airlines, believes there may be more fundamental flaws. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re now seven months into the grounding with no clear timetable for a reintroduction to service.\n\n\u201cThat says to me, it isn\u2019t just software. You can see regulators being uncomfortable with an aircraft that tends to go nose-up.\n\n\u201cIt may be that regulators say \u2018you have to get rid of the root cause\u2019.\u201d\n\nA redesign of the engine mounting to eliminate the nose-up effect would require far more time and money than a software fix.\n\nEven when the US FAA is satisfied with Boeing\u2019s changes, other safety regulators may withhold approval until they have conducted their own investigations into the changes.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Europe\u2019s EASA and many other regulators were appalled by the FAA\u2019s insistence that the Boeing 737 Max was safe, even after the loss of the Ethiopian Airlines jet.\n\nBritain banned the plane on 12 March 2019, and on the same day the FAA said: \u201cOur review shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.\u201d\n\nWithin two days, though, the Max was grounded worldwide.\n\nAs a result, said Mr Jeans, the normal \u201clockstep\u201dof safety regulators, in which they agree internationally, may not apply.\n\nMr Jeans said: \u201cWhile the bond of trust between regulators has not been broken forever, foreign safety bodies won\u2019t want just to take the FAA as received wisdom.\n\n\u201cThe FAA has blown that for the time being.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Broderick said divergence between Europe and the US may not last for long: \u201cI would be surprised if EASA\u2019s timeline is more than a few weeks off from the US.\n\n\u201cThe FAA and EASA work together very closely, and have forged a very strong relationship that includes having high confidence in each other\u2019s work as part of a larger effort to unify, and improve, global aviation safety standards.\u201d\n\nAsian regulators may behave differently. India\u2019s Spicejet has been badly affected by the grounding, but the director of India\u2019s Directorate General of Civil Aviation has said he will be \u201cconservative\u201d about allowing the plane back in service. China and Indonesia may also insist on their own investigations.\n\nDr Rob Hunter, head of flight safety for the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), said: \u201cSome regulators may have accepted the certification decisions of the FAA without substantial scrutiny because they have trusted the FAA. Regulators may now not automatically accept FAA certificatory decisions.\u201d\n\nMr Broderick warned: \u201cA split between FAA and EASA now risks a larger breakdown in global aviation safety confidence and leadership.\n\n\u201cRegulators should be striving for common standards, not competing views of what is acceptable and what is not.\u201d\n\nWere the Boeing 737 Max to start flying in North America before it is allowed back in the skies of Europe, it could cause consternation.\n\nBritish Airways and Virgin Atlantic could find themselves selling \u201ccodeshare\u201d tickets on their partners American Airlines and Delta respectively, for flights on an aircraft type that the UK CAA does not officially recognise as safe.\n\nReturning the Boeing 737 Max to commercial flight will not be a smooth process. Mr Broderick said some airlines are maintaining their Max aircraft as if they never left the fleet, running engines and systems frequently, and performing routine maintenance.\n\n\u201cThese aircraft would be ready to go in a matter of days, with their return likely governed by how quickly airlines can work the Max back into its flight schedules.\u201d\n\nBut he added: \u201cSome airlines have their Maxs in long-term storage \u2013 mothballed, if you will.\n\n\u201cGetting these aircraft ready will take considerable man-hours. One US airline has estimated 100-150 per aircraft.\u201d\n\nPilots will also demand more training. Dr Hunter of the pilots\u2019 union, Balpa, said that pilots \u201cwere tragically let down\u201d by the way that the Boeing 737 Max was certified, and will be very involved in the return to service of the aircraft.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere needs to be comprehensive training in the simulator and thereafter a further programme of training oversight once the pilots are flying in commercial operations.\n\n\u201cIn practice this involves specially trained captains that sit on the third seat on the flight deck. These captains monitor and give advice and guidance to crews in their early days of flying the aircraft.\n\n\u201cWith these arrangements in place the public should be reassured that it is safe to fly in this aircraft.\u201d\n\nBut whether the public will feel reassured is another matter.\n\nIn June 2019, a Twitter poll by The Independent found that more than half of passengers would not want to fly on a Boeing 737 Max.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson said: \u201cThe confidence of the flying public is very, very important to us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re listening to the flying public to ensure we consider their feedback about our communications as we finish up the certification process on the software update and return the 737 Max safely to flight.\u201d\n\nMr Broderick said that US airlines are attuned to concerns: \u201cThe smartest ones are permitting passengers no-fuss, no-charge changes from flights operated by Maxs to other flights.\n\n\u201cSome are even planning mandatory training for pilots, cabin crew, and other frontline staff on how to address concerns expressed by nervous customers.\u201d\n\nBut there is no legal obligation to offer alternative flights if passengers are concerned about an aircraft type. European airlines such as Ryanair \u2013 which was due to start flying a specially designed Boeing 737 Max, the -200 version \u2013 may adopt a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d attitude.\n\nThe veteran aviation journalist Malcolm Ginsberg reaches back into history \u2013 and the Comet disasters of the 1950s. \u201cThere was no public resistance about the Comet 4 being the first jet across the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cThe DC10 remained popular even after it was temporarily grounded, with Laker Airways using it for cheap transatlantic flying.\n\n\u201cHowever we now live in powerful social media age and this will certainly have an effect. It only takes for one person to give a plausible \u2018don\u2019t-fly story\u2019 for it to go viral and everything will stop.\u201d\n\nFormer Monarch boss Tim Jeans said: \u201cI think this will blow over faster than many people think.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that the Boeing 737 Max will be as safe as any aircraft has ever been.\u201d\n\nDr Hunter of Balpa said: \u201cWe think that the aircraft will be successfully returned to service because the penalties for further failure will be so great.\u201d\n\nSean Broderick said the travelling public should focus on aviation\u2019s remarkable safety record: \u201cAs the Max tragedies show, the industry is not perfect, and it never will be.\n\n\u201cYet it remains incomprehensibly safe compared to other modes of mass transportation, and efforts to make it even safer will never stop.\u201d\n\nThe harsh truth is that aviation safety is built on the painstakingly investigation of past tragedies. The report into the Lion Air loss on 29 October 2018 is dedicated to those who lost their lives in the crash.\n\n\u201cTheir sacrifice will not be in vain. They will be forever missed and never forgotten.\u201d", "description": "Soon after dawn on 29 October 2018, Lion Air flight 610 took off from Jakarta airport.
