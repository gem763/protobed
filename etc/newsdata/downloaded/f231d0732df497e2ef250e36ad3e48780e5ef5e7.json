But Tesco has emerged stronger than ever.'\n\nStill, plenty of challenges remain for Tesco as it transitions from a period of turnaround to one of growth.\n\nDiscounters are continuing to gnaw away at the grocery market at speed, ensuring that competition across the sector remains as fierce as ever.\n\nAccording to Kantar, Tesco's market share recently slipped from 27.4 per cent to 26.9 per cent, while Aldi gained shoppers to gain a handle on 8.1 per cent of the market.\n\nThis points to future margin pressure for Tesco, as it will need to keep cutting prices and costs (or offloading assets as it did recently with its mortgage book) to remain competitive.\n\nThere's also the possible ramifications of a no-deal Brexit, which - as widely documented - could cause particular issues for the supermarket and retail sectors.\n\nAs Neil Wilson from Markets.com says, 'Brexit is the unknown item in bagging area,' despite Lewis's assertions today that a 'very comprehensive mitigation plan' is in place.\n\nSome questions also remain over Tesco's new discount chain 'Jack's'. The closure of one of its Jack's stores last month, barely a year after the concept launched, is not a good sign for the future of the trial.\n\nThere's speculation too that the business may look to offload its troubled Polish division, where weak sales are dragging on Tesco's Central Europe division.\n\nAs Hunter says: 'In this notoriously cut-throat sector, a new threat is always around the corner. Be that in the form of the discounters, the potential emergence of Amazon in this space, or the next price war.'\n\nQuestions remain over the future of Tesco's new discount chain 'Jack's', which the company launched less than a year ago\n\nSo it's over to new recruit Ken Murphy, but how will the 52-year-old Irishman cope?\n\nMurphy's appointment initially raised some eyebrows, largely because the former Walgreens Boots Alliance CCO, who rose through the ranks, doesn't have any specific grocery experience.\n\nBut Tesco chairman John Allen defended the hire, dubbing Murphy a 'growth orientated seasoned business leader'.\n\nThe firm argued that Murphy will not be in entirely uncharted waters because Walgreens sells food and he, like Lewis, also has experience in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry.\n\nAllen emphasised that the search process was 'very, very thorough indeed' as he spent nearly a year hunting for suitable experience, proven leadership in international retail and a strong strategic mind.\n\nMurphy secured a commerce degree in University College Cork before going on to study at Harvard Business School.\n\nCommenting on the incoming chief, Wilson says: 'Ken Murphy has solid pedigree, coming from Walgreens Boots Alliance.'\n\nWalgreens Boots has, like Tesco, been through heavy cost cutting amid pressure on earnings, which Wilson believes will give Murphy a head start when he steps into Lewis's shoes.\n\n'He'll need to employ these skills at Tesco where he'll have to contend with tougher organic comparisons post the Lewis era. Moreover the battle with the discounters is only just starting,' Wilson says.\n\nMicheal Hewson from CMC Markets, however, says it is 'puzzling' that Tesco decided to go with an outsider to replace Lewis, particularly given the success of the last five years.\n\n'Only time will tell, but the fact they've gone with an outsider is a strange one,' he says.\n\nEither way, investors didn't seem too perturbed, as shares remained broadly flat at \u00a32.39 after the announcement.\n\nHowever, it's possible shareholders opted to focus instead on the better-than-expected results and the dividend hike for now.\n\nIf investors do decide to walk away with Lewis, they have until next summer to do so.", "description": "It's hard to underestimate the scale of the task Lewis faced as he got his feet under the table - not just drawing a line under the scandal but bringing Tesco back from a catastrophic \u00a36.33billion loss.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
