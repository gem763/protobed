It was such a terribly sad day.\n\n'I know everything has to end at some point but I never thought it would. It's all that I've ever known.\n\n'People travelled from all over the country to us.\n\n'My earliest memories of the place is people working through the night on clothes. It was a buzzing family business.\n\n'We were up against the biggest dry cleaners in the business but we offered a daily turnaround and we were hard to compete with.\n\n'It was absolutely fantastic to be a part of.'\n\nAlso among its famous clients was Winston Churchill and wife Lady Clementine, who both visited the store for the maintenance of their outfits.

Pictured: Inside the laundry room\n\nSole heir to the dry cleaning business, Howard Bradley (pictured with wife Carol Young), has now decided to shut down the last dry cleaning store of the family empire, in Milton Keynes\n\nBradleys was first opened in 1832 in central London by Samuel Bradley Senior, initially as a garments restoration shop which would see people tale their dinner dresses, suits and best clothes for storage and restoration.\n\nIn 1860 the business opened London's very first fur store in Chepstow Place, London - which by 1912 was the largest in Europe.\n\nSamuel's son, Bernard, ran the store from 1906 for the next 44 years.\n\nDuring this period, Bradleys grew so popular the business commissioned six cars to offer their clients a bespoke service.\n\nThose clients included Winston Churchill and wife Lady Clementine and an invoice from February 1937 shows they spent \u00a33.90 in the shop - the equivalent of \u00a3264 today.\n\nHowever the onset of the Second World War rocked not only the business, but the economy it relied on, leaving the business in a financially- strained state.\n\nDuring this period many Bradleys workers were also killed in the war and one of its main buildings was hit by a bomb during the London Blitz.\n\nHoward continued: 'The business nearly folded after the war and people simply could not afford us anymore,' he said.\n\n'There was no money in the country at all.\n\n'But the post-war era was very good for us.\n\n'My dad did something brave to reinvent the company and that saved it really.'\n\nIn the early 1950s, Bernard Bradley (pictured right), Howard's grandfather, retired and passed over the reigns to his sons\n\nThe family business has been responsible for restoring RAF uniforms (right) and working on Ralf Schumacher's racing suit (left)\n\nThe store has been responsible for looking after wedding dresses dating back to the Second World War (left) and has even restored a US Army parka from the Korean War (right)\n\nAfter the war, the business became known for the then up-and-coming trend of dry-cleaning, Pictured: Restored vintage military informs inside the Milton Keynes shop\n\nIn the 1950s, after the war came to an end, Bradleys ditched the expensive fur coat and restoration works for the then up-and-coming trend of dry-cleaning, which soon became a popular activity among the middle and upper classes.\n\nThe owner at the time, Bernard Bradley, soon retired and left the dry cleaning business to his son Eric- Howard's father.\n\nHoward, who had started working at Bradleys aged seven as the tea boy on Saturdays, said: 'Dry cleaning was still fairly new at the time and it was trendy to have your clothes dry cleaned.'\n\nIn 1977, the East Finchley store closed and Bradleys relocated again, this time to Milton Keynes, where it remained - albeit in two different city locations.\n\nIts most famous customers to date have included Princess Anne, Prince Charles, George Michael, Lewis Hamiltion and former Tory prime minister Margaret Thatcher.\n\nA Formula One racing suit worn by Michael Schumacher's brother, Ralf, was also treated at the store and actor George Michael was a regular customer, Howard recalled.\n\nEric, who died in 2002, ran the business until the 1990s when Howard took over.\n\nSole heir Howard described closing down the Milton Keynes store as a 'terribly sad day'. Pictured: Display inside the shop in Milton Keynes\n\nEric Bradley (pictured), who died in 2002, ran the business until the 1990s before his son Howard decided to take over the family operation\n\nHoward took the store back to its restoration roots and had the business service clothes for museums and historic collections.

Business was drying up.\n\nWho were Bradleys most famous customers? Winston Churchill and Lady Clementine Churchill\n\nPrincess Anne\n\nPrince Charles\n\nKing Faisal of Saudia Arabia\n\nBrigitte Bardot\n\nGeorge Michael\n\nLedley King\n\nIan Poulter\n\nDee Dee Wilde (Pan\u2019s People)\n\nRalf Schumacher\n\nLewis Hamilton\n\nAston Martin\n\n'The restorations was going really well but it wasn't enough to keep it going alone.\n\n'V Clean gave me assurances that we could keep the family name.\n\n'They'd just have us under their company umbrella. It was the best thing for us at the time.'\n\nAs part of the move, Howard was appointed director of V Clean but with the company owing \u00a31.4m billion to creditors, the business entered administration before finally shutting down on February 1.\n\nHoward, who is married to Yvonne, 57, said: 'It was a business I loved and I do miss it dearly.\n\n'I did what I thought was best for the staff and the company and I know my dad would appreciate that.\n\n'It was beyond my control to save it and I felt physically sick. Dry cleaning as a business is dying a death and business was drying up.\n\n'I felt gutted. We have such a long history, and that won't change, but I didn't want it to end so soon.\n\n'I am so proud of what the business was. It was my entire life and my pride and joy.\n\n'The last day was a sad and heartbreaking day. I just did what I felt was in the best interest of the business but I still feel so guilty for what happened.'", "description": "Bradleys Dry Cleaners' sole heir Howard Bradley, has decided to shut down the last dry cleaning store of the family empire, in Milton Keynes after the business was purchased by  V Clean Life last year", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/17/20389558-0-image-a-26_1572457982447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
