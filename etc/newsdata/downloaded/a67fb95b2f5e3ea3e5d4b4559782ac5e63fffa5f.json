She has now been summoned to be questioned by US congressional committees in the impeachment inquiry against Trump.", "description": "Ukraine has opened a probe into possible abuse of power by Yuriy Lutsenko, the former prosecutor who figures in the whistleblower complaint against US President Donald Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7868/3a2c4b48ecf540e9b94bc6510f41fa0a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
