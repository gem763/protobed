New data show first foster care decrease since 2011, record number of adoptions\n\n2. United Arab Emirates to fund rebuilding of Catholic churches destroyed by ISIS\n\n3. Democracy Won\u2019t Save the Middle East\u2019s Religious Minorities\n\n4. Catholic agency says Nobel Prize can shine light on peacebuilding in Ethiopia\n\n5. This Elizabeth Warren tweet:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional right. Every time we deny access to safe, legal abortion, we put lives in danger. I\u2019ve got a plan to protect our reproductive health care in every state. #StopTheBansSC https://t.co/Lt0vPDPgAR \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 23, 2019\n\nOf course, \u201cwe put lives in danger\u201d . . . with legal abortion. And then there are the hearts and souls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason I wrote this about a recent experience outside an abortion clinic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Michael Wear in The Atlantic: Why Democrats Must Regain the Trust of Religious Voters\n\n7.\n\nToday, I sent a letter to @TheJusticeDept AG Barr, @ONDCP Director Carroll, And @NIH Director Collins Regarding Gender Dysphoria On Young Children. pic.twitter.com/PrrA5c7Sea \u2014 Rep. Chip Roy (@RepChipRoy) October 24, 2019\n\n8. Simone Biles: From foster care to the most decorated gymnast of all time\n\n9.\n\nOctober is Down Syndrome Month. Here's a bit of trivia.

I'll outline it below: pic.twitter.com/ryoCKkMO5h \u2014 JD Flynn (@jdflynn) October 24, 2019\n\n10. A Book on Dignity for All Has Much to Teach the Church\n\n11. This is encouraging: a campaign centered around the declaration: \u201cMy faith guides my politics, not the other way around\u201d\n\n12.\n\nCivility is inherently tied to human dignity, and in terms of the practical viability of civility as a widely-embraced norm, it must be explicitly tied to human dignity. You cannot be civil if you are dehumanizing others. Our firmness on this point must be resolute. https://t.co/LLlgBL5ibf \u2014 Michael Wear (@MichaelRWear) October 23, 2019\n\n13. George Weigel on the \u201cIdeological Hijacking\u201d of John XXIII\n\nOne of my favorite things WFB ever wrote (but I have a number) was his remembrance of John XXIII when he died). He\u2019s thoroughly misunderstood and underappreciated. His Journal of the Soul should be required reading for diocesan priests, especially.\n\n14. A plea to revive the rom-com\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15.\n\nYou may not have looks or charm, but are you loud, baby? I loved this piece by Cara Giaimo (@cjgiaimo ).
