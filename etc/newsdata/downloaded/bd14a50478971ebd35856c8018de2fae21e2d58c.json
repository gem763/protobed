The updated Galaxy Fold will be available on September 6th in Korea, the company announced. The handset will also be available on September 18th in France, Germany, Singapore, and the UK, but Samsung hasn\u2019t revealed an exact date for the US.\n\nIn the US it will arrive \u201cin the coming weeks,\u201d according to another press release. It has been rumored that it would launch in the US on September 27th, but we haven\u2019t had that confirmed by Samsung yet.\n\nRelated How Samsung fixed the Galaxy Fold\n\nSamsung is also offering a new thing it\u2019s calling \u201cGalaxy Fold Premier Service,\u201d though details on what exactly it is are vague beyond \u201cdirect access to Samsung experts who can provide you tailored guidance and support over the phone any time, any day. This includes an optional one-on-one onboarding session.\u201d Presumably that one-on-one session would happen in-person and would probably involve explaining how to treat (and not treat) the delicate screen.\n\nSamsung has confirmed to The Verge that this service is included in the price of the Galaxy Fold.\n\nSamsung's offering Montblanc luxury cases to early buyers in South Korea! And the Fold will be coming to the U.S. on Sept 27 https://t.co/e7mq3WNiJ2 \u2014 Sohee Kim (@soheefication) September 5, 2019\n\nSamsung originally delayed the retail launch of the phone after reviewers discovered serious hardware problems almost immediately. Some reviewers peeled off a protective film that was meant to be permanent, damaging the panel. The Verge didn\u2019t do that, but our original unit had some debris that still managed to get under the hinge and damage the screen. Samsung responded to multiple, high-profile reports of issues by officially delaying the release of the $1,980 device and canceling preorders.\n\nIt looked like the Galaxy Fold may never make it to stores, but Samsung says it has fixed the device by extending the protective layer beyond the bezels, adding more reinforcements to protect against debris, and strengthening the top and bottom of the hinge with \u201cprotection caps.\u201d You can see the detailed changes Samsung is making here.\n\nHopefully Samsung will provide more detailed launch dates for other regions. It ends one of today\u2019s releases by saying \u201cduring the coming weeks, we look forward to sharing more\u201d and given the tumultuous history of this phone\u2019s launch, we look forward to hearing more.\n\nUpdate, September 5th 6AM ET: Article updated with September 18th launch date for France, Germany, Singapore, and the UK.", "description": "Samsung is releasing its foldable phone in September.
