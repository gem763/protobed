Audio of the dispatch from the officer was also posted to Broadcastify.\n\nAfter the officer activated his siren the vehicle fled, triggering the officer to call for backup. According to the blog, the Tesla patrol car engaged in a chase that reached speeds of up to 120 mph before the officer signaled that his patrol car was in trouble.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m down to 6 miles of battery in my Tesla. I may lose it,\u201d he radioed, allowing a backup unit to take his number-one position in the chase.\n\nIn a statement, Fremont Police Department spokeswoman Geneva Bosques clarified to TIME that the officer ended his pursuit during the last minute of the 10-mile, 10-minute-long pursuit when his battery was running low.\n\n\u201cHis battery never died,\u201d Bosques\u2019 statement read. \u201cThere were several additional patrol units behind him.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bosques, the Tesla was not fully charged at the beginning of the officer\u2019s 2 p.m. Friday shift, noting that when the patrol car is fully charged, the battery life can last well over the typical 11-hour shift with life to spare.\n\n\u201cThere could be a variety of reasons why it wasn\u2019t fully charged and I, unfortunately, can\u2019t comment on the exact reason on this particular day,\u201d Bosques said. \u201cIt happens from time to time, especially if an officer returns to the station to take a report and then they never go back out in the street.\u201d\n\nBosques says that despite the battery issue, this was the second pursuit the Tesla has \u201cperformed well in,\u201d and said the department is keeping track of all data as they are still in the first 6 months of its pilot program.\n\n\u201cThis one instance does not in any way change our feeling regarding the performance of the vehicle for patrol purposes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far the car is meeting or exceeding our expectations.\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, Fremont Police announced the purchase of the 2014 Tesla Model S 85 patrol vehicles, their first all-electric powered patrol car. They said the cars began patrolling the streets of Fremont in March 2019.", "description": "Even so, police say the patrol cars are 'meeting or exceeding our expectations'", "authors": ["Gina Martinez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5sIqouEDIapvorV6ANvrIA--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/82e34cdffc51b2e328d9ac396dfa4397", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
