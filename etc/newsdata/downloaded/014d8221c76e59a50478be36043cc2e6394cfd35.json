The study titled \u201cRetail CBDCs: The next payments frontier\u201d researched data from over 20 economies worldwide concluding that:\n\nCentral banks are responding to the reality that digital currencies, either privately or publicly issued, will soon be part of the global monetary system, and that it is in their interest to ensure they are neither left behind nor displaced.\n\nThe study also determined that the first CBDC will be available within the next 5 years:\n\nThe principal conclusion is that we are likely to witness the introduction of a central bank \u2014 that is fiat \u2014 retail digital currency within the next five years, either as a complement to or as a substitute for notes and coins.\n\nThe investigation also confirmed that about 38% of the banks involved in the study were already experimenting with the technology at some point, even planning on testing products in the near future.\n\nDespite Facebook not getting the green light with the Libra coin, it appears this forced major banks to think outside the box and began hurrying on providing a new type of service that could take advantage of blockchain technology and the benefits it represents.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cryptocoin.News Is The Central News Source For Information On Cryptocurrencies.
