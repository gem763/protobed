Those seeking an investigation want to know if the president made U.S. aid contingent on Ukraine investigating Trump\u2019s political opponent.\n\nBiden has been attacked by those who say that while he was vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine and called for the firing of a state prosecutor looking into a gas company where Hunter Biden held a board position. Trump himself has doubled down on these claims against Biden.\n\n\u201cIf Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,\u201d Pompeo said on ABC\u2018s \u201cThis Week.\u201c\n\nHe added, \u201cAmerica cannot have our elections interfered with \u2026 If there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

He pointed to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko\u2019s statement that there was no pressure applied in the conversation between the world leaders. In response to a question about releasing the phone call transcript, Pompeo deferred to the White House.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t release transcripts very often,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cThose are private conversations between world leaders and it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to do so except in \u2014 in the most extreme circumstances.\u201d", "description": "Pompeo joined many Trump allies in pivoting the conversation to discrediting the Democratic 2020 front-runner.", "authors": ["Rishika Dugyala"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5c/f5/743d34d94a97b09283dbf82ade6d/20190922-mike-pompeo-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
