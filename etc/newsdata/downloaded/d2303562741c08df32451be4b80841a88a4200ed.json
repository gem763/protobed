The order also could be heard as at least a partial answer to those who have criticized the president\u2019s policy.\n\nThe officials indicated that Mr. Trump could describe the continued deployment of the small contingent of troops as a thoughtful, reasonable way to help safeguard regional and American security without violating his campaign pledge.\n\nThe senior official insisted the president\u2019s approach to the incursion ordered by Mr. Erdogan had been mischaracterized, and pushed back against a widely held public narrative that Mr. Trump \u201cgreenlighted\u201d the attack. Critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s Syria policy have said the president, by telling Mr. Erdogan that he would order American troops to pull back from positions along the border where they had fought alongside Syrian Kurds, essentially acquiesced to the Turkish offensive.\n\nMr. Erdogan called Mr. Trump on Oct. 6 for the express purpose of informing him that Turkish forces planned to cross the border, the official said, and Mr. Trump made it clear to him that it was not a good idea \u2014 and did not endorse the attack. Mr. Trump followed up on Oct. 9 with a now-infamous letter to Mr. Erdogan.\n\nThe senior administration official said that the American troops were withdrawn from the border area because Turkish forces were coming across into Syria, and that they were sitting in harm\u2019s way, a rationale that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also have expressed in recent days.\n\nSpokeswomen for Mr. Esper and General Milley declined on Sunday to comment on any options under discussion.\n\nWhite House officials argue that leaving a small contingent of troops in eastern Syria is not a policy reversal because the goal of the original withdrawal was to protect lives. Unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal order in December, administration officials say, this time was never about bringing troops home because they were always going to remain elsewhere in the region, in particular in Iraq.", "description": "The president appears to be trying to balance competing impulses: bringing troops home while ensuring that efforts to contain ISIS will continue \u2014 and answering withering criticism for his Syria policy.", "authors": ["Eric Schmitt", "Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/us/20dc-MILITARY/20dc-MILITARY-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
