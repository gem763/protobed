The stealthy startup announced a $2 million seed round.\n\nDefy Partners led the round with a slew of other participants including Paul English, co-founder of Kayak; Wayne Chang, co-founder of Crashlytics; Brian Halligan, co-founder and CEO of HubSpot; Jonathan Kraft, president and COO of the Kraft Group and the New England Patriots; MIT Prof. Edward Roberts; Eric Dobkin, founder and chairman emeritus of Goldman Sachs Global Equity Capital Markets and Susquehanna International Group.\n\nThe prestigious group of investors saw that Searchable.ai is trying to solve a big problem around findability. Company co-founder Brian Shin says that knowledge workers have been struggling for years trying to find a way to better utilize all of the information that exists within an organization.\n\n\u201cThe problem we\u2019re really solving is that there are a trillion documents created every year in Microsoft Office, Google Docs, etc., and it\u2019s really difficult if you\u2019re a knowledge worker to find what you need in terms of either a document, an asset like a slide or worksheet within a document or the actual answer to a question that you have,\u201d Shin said.\n\nThe questioning part could be particularly valuable because it lets you ask a natural language question and find a specific piece of information within a document, rather than just the document itself. \u201cLet\u2019s say you have a giant spreadsheet, you could actually ask a question of all your spreadsheets and find the atomic unit of knowledge that you\u2019re actually looking for,\u201d he said.\n\nThe product itself is not quite ready for the big reveal, but if it works as described, it will be a huge boost to knowledge workers who have continually struggled to find a nugget of information they know is out there across the myriad documents in an organization.\n\nShin is an experienced entrepreneur, who has helped launch and sell three companies. He reports he has raised $100 million in venture capital and most recently has worked as a venture capitalist himself, but he saw this opportunity and decided to jump back into the development side of things.\n\nHe admits he\u2019s giving up a lot to go back to the startup lifestyle, but he and his co-founders decided this was worth it. \u201cYou know the draw, the compulsion to do another startup is is really what this is about. So my three other colleagues and I have have all started companies before and we\u2019re all giving up big jobs to do this, and I\u2019m so excited about the team and the massive opportunity.\u201d\n\nHe promised more details about the company and the solution would be coming early next year.", "description": "Searchable.ai wants to solve an old problem around search in the enterprise.
