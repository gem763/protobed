For more information, see The Daily Beast's reporting here.\n\nThe residents of 301 East 66th St. always knew Ehud Barak was there by the flashy cars parked outside and burly security guards in the lobby. The former Israeli prime minster\u2019s visits were an open secret among the tenants of the Upper East Side building, which is owned by Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s younger brother.\n\nSeveral residents of 301 East 66th St. told The Daily Beast they had seen Barak in the building multiple times over the last few years, and nearly half a dozen more described running into his security detail. The building is majority-owned by Epstein\u2019s younger brother, Mark, and has been tied to the financier\u2019s alleged New York trafficking ring.\n\nWhen asked about his stays at 301 E. 66th Street, Barak told The Daily Beast, \u201cDespite the fact that there was no wrongdoing on my part, and that there is not even the faintest suspicion of wrongdoing on my part, I\u2019m not going to address these questions because in the current political environment in Israel, the mere fact of my response to such a question is churned up as spin in the political game.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a former prime minister I\u2019m accompanied by bodyguards everywhere I go,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile the Israeli politician has tried to play down his ties to Jeffrey Epstein since the billionaire\u2019s indictment on charges of child sex trafficking, Barak became a fixture of the Epstein story after Israeli outlets reported he had received more than $3 million in payments from Epstein-connected institutions since 2004.\n\nThe former prime minister was also photographed leaving Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side mansion in 2016 and has acknowledged visiting the billionaire\u2019s private Caribbean island, where Epstein is accused of hosting orgies with underage girls.\n\nBarak has repeatedly denied any knowledge of Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes and maintains he never so much as talked to the financier in the presence of underage women. In a previous interview with The Daily Beast, Barak said he was first introduced to the financier by Israeli leader Shimon Peres in 2002, and saw Epstein only \u201con occasion\u201d after that.\n\n\u201cI've never been there at a party,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the contrary, at his home, I met many very respected people, scientists, Nobel Prize winners, and I met him also in Boston, at MIT or the Harvard labs he supports.\u201d\n\nAs Business Insider reported earlier this week, residents of 301 East 66th St. described Barak as a frequent presence at their 16-story building. One resident told The Daily Beast that she saw and recognized the statesman in the lobby, while another said he was identified to her by a doorman or fellow resident.\n\nFive other current and former residents said they had not seen Barak in person, but saw his security detail around the building on multiple occasions. One recalled riding in the elevator with bodyguards speaking Hebrew, while another said she regularly saw someone posted outside an 11th-floor apartment. Another woman recalled seeing the security detail in the lobby at least a dozen times.\n\n\u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t in his apartment, [the security guards] would hang out in the lobby as if it was their own living room,\u201d one disgruntled resident recalled. \u201cThey would sprawl out, they\u2019d put all their shit on the couches, and sometimes they ate on the table there.\u201d\n\nThe majority of the units in the building are owned by Ossa Properties, a real estate company started by Mark Epstein. The younger Epstein has admitted to renting out apartments to Jeffrey for personal use, but maintains that his brother has no ownership stake in the building. When a Daily Beast reporter called for further comment, Mark Epstein hung up.\n\nIn 2010, a former bookkeeper for Mc2\u2014the modeling agency owned by Epstein associate Jean-Luc Brunel\u2014told the FBI that the 66th St. apartments were being used to house underage girls from South America, Europe and the former Soviet Union. In a sworn statement obtained by the Miami Herald, the bookkeeper claimed Brunel was sending the girls to Epstein\u2019s parties or loaning them out to wealthy clients to be molested.\n\nBrad Edwards, an attorney for several of Epstein\u2019s victims, raised many of the same allegations in a deposition later that year.\n\n\u201cThose females get work visas to say that they\u2019re models, but actually they are prostituted out by Jeffrey Epstein and Jean-Luc Brunel, correct?\u201d Edwards asked Adriana Ross, one of Epstein\u2019s former assistants. \u201cAnd various businessmen and politicians around New York and Washington D.C. go to these apartments frequently and have sex with underage minors, is that true?\u201d\n\nRoss, who has been accused of helping orchestrate Epstein\u2019s \u201cmassages,\u201d invoked her right against self-incrimination and declined to reply.\n\nEpstein\u2019s pilot, Larry Visoski, said in a 2009 deposition that he was paid via a company located at 301 East 66th St., from Epstein's longtime accountant Darren Indyke. (Property records show Indyke lived in the building until at least 2000.) Visoski claimed Lesley Groff\u2014an assistant of Epstein\u2019s who is accused of helping him procure underage girls\u2014also worked out of the building.\n\nSarah Kellen, another assistant who was accused of helping schedule Epstein\u2019s \u201cmassages,\u201d ran an interior design firm out of the building as recently as 2015. Nadia Marcinkova, who was accused of participating in sexual encounters with Epstein\u2019s underage girls, registered an aviation business to the 66th St. building in 2011. Property records show Marcinkova\u2019s apartment was also located on the 11th floor.\n\nLast year, an Israeli investigative journalist revealed that Barak received about $2.4 million in 2004 from the Wexner Foundation, where Epstein was both a trustee and major donor. Epstein also reportedly invested $1 million in Barak\u2019s technology start-up, Carbyne, in 2015\u2014almost a decade after the billionaire pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage prostitute.\n\nBarak has said he is looking into how to disentangle Epstein from Carbyne\u2019s finances. He has refused to expand on the work he did for the Wexner Foundation, other than to say that he \u201cdid what I committed to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI perform research and geopolitical consulting for a lot of interested parties,\u201d he previously told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt is up to them if they want to discuss it.\u201d\n\nStill, the controversy has followed the statesman throughout Israel\u2019s elections, where Barak is running to replace current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier this month, Netanyahu\u2014who is facing indictment in several corruption cases himself\u2014called for an investigation into Barak\u2019s relationship with Epstein. In a complaint to the Israeli attorney general, a lawyer for Netanyahu\u2019s party suggested the Wexner Foundation could constitute illegal foreign donations.\n\nBarak responded with a joking tweet.\n\n\u201cIt pains me to hear that people I know are in trouble with the law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFirst Netanyahu, now Epstein. My wish for them both is that the truth will out. Period.\u201d\n\nWith additional reporting by Noga Tarnopolsky", "description": "Residents of a building owned by Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s brother say the former Israeli prime minister was a frequent guest when he was in New York.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565033096/190731-shugerman-epstein-scoop-tease_xdm1qo", "published_at": "2019-08-05"}
