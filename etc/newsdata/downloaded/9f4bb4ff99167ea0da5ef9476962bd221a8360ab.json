Stephen Franko, officers Janet Mondragon Dahne Sebastian, and Ricardo Viramontes, were fired by the Chicago Police Board in July.\n\nHowever, they have filed lawsuits to fight their terminations.\n\nVan Dyke fatally shot McDonald, an African American 17 year old, a total of 16 times in a matter of 15 seconds in October 2014. He was convicted of second-degree murder last year\n\nThis page of the report reveals the probe found that Van Dyke 'made numerous false statements and material omissions' during interviews with the Chicago Police Department and the Independent Police Review Authority to 'exaggerate the threat McDonald posed'\n\nThe report revealed that a lieutenant at the scene named Anthony Wojcik destroyed then 'personally recreated' investigators' notes without telling the detectives.\n\n'Wojcik improperly disposed of three original general progress reports containing CPD detectives' handwritten notes of the statements three civilian witnesses made the night of the shooting,' Wojcik's report states.\n\n'Prior to disposing of the original reports, which disposal he failed to document, Wojcik personally recreated the reports. However, Wojcik did not ask the detectives who had taken the statements to review the recreated reports for accuracy and did not inform them of his recreation of their original reports until several months after CPD officially closed its investigation of the shooting,' the reports adds.\n\nThe report also recommended the firing of another officer at the scene of the shooting named Janet Mondragon. It called her credibility 'severely limited by her uncooperativeness'.\n\nWhen questioned by officials she said she didn't not remember or did not recall about 145 times, according to the report.\n\nShe claimed she was looking down and putting her vehicle transmission into park when McDonald was shot. However her gear shift ever was on the steering wheel at the time.\n\nProtesters take to the streets chanting and blocking traffic in 2015 after the release of a video showing Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke, shooting 17 year old Laquan McDonald\n\nIt also revealed Sgt. Franko approved false reports submitted by his subordinates and failed to take action when he learned cameras weren't working. Under his supervision officers also were found to have inserted batteries into their dashcam microphones upside down a trick known to get around effectively using the microphones, according to CBS.\n\nFranko had approved four reports by Van Dyke and Walsh in which they reported McDonald was swinging a knife, which wasn't true.\n\nThe report further found that several officers at the scene failed to make sure their dashboard cameras were working properly and failed to attach the camera's microphone.\n\nThe report said the failure to properly use equipment 'prevented CPD from collecting potentially important, objective, technology-based evidence of the McDonald shooting.'\n\nOfficers Arturo Becerra and Leticia Velez were chastised in the report for failing to notify their supervisors that their dashcam wasnt working at the start of their shifts.\n\nThe report accuses Sgt. Daniel Gallagher of working with Detective David March and Lt. Anthony Wojick to file a false report on the shooting days before it was finally submitted that alleged McDonald was swinging his knife aggressively towards Van Dyke, when in reality he wasn't.\n\nThe findings also recommended firing Deputy Chief David McNaughton, who was the ranking officer on the scene after the shooting, for approving false statements by Van Dyke and two others in the shooting.\n\nHe checked a box in the case's tactical response report stating he concluded the shooting was justified instead of ticking off that 'further investigation is required'.\n\n'McNaughton's creation and endorsement of those false statements all served to establish a false narrative that McDonald initiated an attack on Van Dyke and Walsh,' the report said.\n\nThe over 6,500-page report was made public for the first time on Wednesday and revealed the white cop Jason Van Dyke repeatedly submitted false reports, made false statements and disobeyed orders from supervisors during the shooting investigation.\n\nThis CCTV image shows the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald on October 20, 2014\n\nThe trove of documents were released in a move led by Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration to build trust with the public over high-profile police misconduct investigations.\n\nA City Ordinance passed last month gave Chicago's corporation counsel the power to release any reports by Inspector General Joseph Ferguson for cases involving deaths and police officers or city employees. Previously, such reports were kept confidential by law.\n\nInspector General Joseph Ferguson found that Van Dyke repeatedly lied in the probe to make it seem like McDonald posed a bigger threat\n\nIn the 2014 shooting cops responded to reports of McDonald carrying a knife and breaking into vehicles in a trucking yard on the city's south side.\n\nVideo of the shooting shows Van Dyke advancing on McDonald. When McDonald walked away from the officer, Van Dyke opened fire. With the first bullet McDonald spun and fell to the ground, still holding the knife. Van Dyke continued to fire into the teenager, setting off 16 rounds and expending the maximum capacity of his 9mm semi-automatic firearm.\n\nHowever, the report revealed that Van Dyke told investigators McDonald was moving towards him - though video footage to the contrary showed the teen walking away.\n\n'He's getting, he's getting closer to me....He's still wavin' the knife st me. I'm thinkin' he's going do somethin' to me...I think he's going to try and take my life away from me,' Van Dyke said in a transcript of his questioning included in the report.\n\nWhen investigators asked: 'And what happens?'\n\nVan Dyke replied: 'I shoot 'em.'\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police have slammed the release of the report calling it a 'little more than a political witch hunt'.\n\n'The Fraternal Order of Police has articulated in several instances our strongly-held belief that the Inspector General's office, particularly under Joe Ferguson, is often little more than a political witch hunt of our members, none more so than the manner by which his office generated criminal indictments of the three officers in connection with the Laquan McDonald shooting. Those officers, tried by special prosecutor Patricia Holmes, were acquitted,' the union said in a statement last month.'", "description": "Chicago's law department released the city watchdog's investigative reports on the murder of Laquan McDonald, left, on Wednesday, after he was shot by officer Jason Van Dyke, right, in 2014.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang", "Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/05/19524144-0-image-a-15_1570683497332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
