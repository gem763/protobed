Read more\n\nTo win a vote, the prime minister would need the support of almost all Eurosceptics in the Conservative party, as well as most of the former Tories from whom he withdrew the whip and either the DUP or a bloc of Labour MPs.\n\nJohnson is edging closer to the number he needs, with more prominent Eurosceptics now on board with his plans. However, the DUP, which has reservations over plans to leave Northern Ireland in close alignment with the EU, has still not publicly declared its backing.\n\nLabour MPs will need reassurances about workers\u2019 rights, environmental protections and the future relationship \u2013 and will come under pressure from their party not to vote with the government.\n\nDespite the fact that Theresa May\u2019s deal was rejected three times by the House of Commons, Rees-Mogg said: \u201cIf a deal is agreed with the European Union, it will get through, in my view, the House of Commons because everybody\u2019s desperate to finish this.\u201d\n\nShedding more light on the process, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for three-and-a-half years; it can\u2019t go on forever. We are near a conclusion and parliament, once it\u2019s agreed something, can legislate very quickly. So, if the meaningful vote goes through, then the legislation will merely be the ratification in domestic law of the treaty and that, I think, is a relatively easy bill to pass if, if there is a deal.\u201d\n\nHe claimed some \u201cbig changes\u201d have happened since May failed to get her deal with the EU through parliament, including a shift in the mood towards getting Brexit done and Brussels agreeing to reopen the withdrawal agreement.\n\nHowever, Amber Rudd, the former cabinet minister who resigned over Johnson\u2019s lack of progress towards a deal, said she thought there was a \u201cwhiff of sexism\u201d about Eurosceptics in the European Research Group potentially being prepared to vote for the prime minister\u2019s deal and not May\u2019s agreement.\n\nShe told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnet: \u201cIt is difficult to fillet it out, how much is about a more trusting relationship that they clearly have with Boris Johnson, because he himself was very much part of that ERG group in terms of wanting a harder Brexit than the former prime minister wanted, but I do feel as a woman who\u2019s active in politics myself, that there is a whiff of sexism, as you put it, as well.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why Conservative MPs could vote for a potential Johnson deal, when they rejected May\u2019s deal, Rudd said: \u201cThere are certain behaviours that particularly men in politics want to see, that women don\u2019t so much, that Boris did adopt, which has given the ERG members a lot of confidence.\n\n\u201cSo, for instance, I was very opposed to the prime minister expelling 21 colleagues from the party as MPs, and I felt very strongly that Ken Clarke, who had been in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet, should have a place in Boris Johnson\u2019s party.\n\n\u201cBut he took a different view, and I thought that was a very aggressive thing to do, and unnecessary, and has had the effect of radicalising the 21 \u2013 which I have now joined. So that sort of aggressive behaviour, though, may be the sort of thing that a group of ERG men, particularly, wanted to see.\u201d", "description": "Commons leader claims MPs will back deal even though PM is yet to get agreement with EU", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88fe5276da073d4b9647bbfbe4471c08f33934e6/526_455_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79cc75eb3666e847b5ec4bb8169d4b78", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
