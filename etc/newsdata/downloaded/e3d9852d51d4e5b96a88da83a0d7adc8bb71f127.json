The hardware didn\u2019t get very high, but it was the first time the test vehicle flew detached from the ground, powered by SpaceX\u2019s next-generation rocket engine.\n\nThe vehicle is a test prototype of SpaceX\u2019s future, Starship rocket. Starship is the company\u2019s most ambitious vehicle concept yet: it\u2019s a fully reusable design intended to send cargo and people to deep space destinations like the Moon and Mars. Similar to SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets, Starship is supposed to land upright \u2014 on Earth or on distant worlds \u2014 and then be able to take off again.\n\nStarship still has a long way to go before it even gets to space, let alone lands on another planet. First, SpaceX wants to validate the basic design of the vehicle as well as its newly developed main engine, the Raptor. That\u2019s what this test was all about. Thanks to a single Raptor engine mounted on its base, the Starship test vehicle briefly flew above SpaceX\u2019s facility in Boca Chica, Texas, moved sideways, and then landed upright. These kinds of tests are often referred to as \u201chops,\u201d which is why this test vehicle was dubbed \u201cStarhopper.\u201d The whole test took about 15 seconds, but it demonstrated the very basic launch and landing capability that Starship will need in the future.\n\nSpaceX first tried to do the flight on Wednesday, July 24th, but had to abort right after igniting the engine. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said Starhopper would fly up to 65 feet (20 meters) high during this flight, though he did not confirm if it reached that height once the test was complete. Live feeds of the test showed the Starhopper covered in clouds, making it difficult to see just how high it flew. The Raptor ignition also caused a large fire near the launch site after the test that burned for up to an hour afterward. Musk confirmed that the test was successful, though. The company will try another hop test in a week or two, he says \u2014 one that will fly more than 650 feet (200 meters) up.\n\nSpaceX has already ignited a Raptor engine underneath Starhopper a few times before, though the rocket remained tethered to the ground for those tests, so it only rose a few inches. Today marked Starhopper\u2019s first free flight, and it came just a week after the vehicle suffered a small failure. Last week, the company ignited the engine underneath the vehicle in preparation for this hop test, and the hardware briefly caught on fire due to a fuel leak. However, the rocket only sustained minimal damage, according to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. \u201c[B]ig advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel: not bothered by a little heat!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nSpaceX plans to fly this same vehicle on more hop tests in the months ahead, but the company is already working on scaling things up. SpaceX is currently building two Starship prototypes that are meant to fly much higher than Starhopper \u2014 one in Boca Chica and another in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Those vehicles will be outfitted with three Raptor engines, Musk says. He claimed that one of the prototypes will \u201chopefully\u201d reach an altitude of 12 miles (20 kilometers) in the next few months. Musk has also hinted that he\u2019ll give a more in-depth presentation on the Starship design later this month, once the Starship vehicles start flying. The CEO has given two presentations on the vehicle \u2014 one in 2016 and one in 2017 \u2014 but the design of Starship has evolved in the months since.\n\nthe company is already working on scaling things up\n\nMusk recently claimed that the Starship / Super Heavy system could perform its first uncrewed landing on the Moon within the next two years, followed by a crewed landing in four. It\u2019s an incredibly ambitious timeline, especially since there\u2019s still quite a lot of work to be done. The final Starship design calls for six total Raptor engines \u2014 three optimized for working best at sea level and three optimized for working best in the vacuum of space. And the entire spacecraft is supposed to launch on top of a larger rocket booster known as the Super Heavy, which has not been developed yet. Musk is also fairly notorious for giving unrealistic estimates for big projects.\n\nAfter today\u2019s test, SpaceX can boast that its precursor to Starship has finally flown. Now, it just needs to keep flying again and again.", "description": "SpaceX launched a test version of its next big rocket from Texas, sending the vehicle hovering more than 65 feet (20 meters) in the air before it landed back on the ground.
