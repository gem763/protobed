I think he'll be out. It certainly looked like it anyway, judging on last night, so it's just one of those things.\n\n(Image: RICHARD WAINWRIGHT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\u201cPaul had an injury, he came back, he worked really hard. He came back and played a couple of games, maybe played through the pain barrier.\n\n\u201cHe had a scan after the Arsenal game and maybe needed a few weeks' rest in a boot, so hopefully he won't be too long, but he won't make this game, no.\"\n\nPogba flew out to Dubai during the international break for a warm weather training camp in a bid to ensure he would be fit for the Liverpool clash at Old Trafford.\n\n(Image: Anders Wiklund/TT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nBut the 26-year-old has been forced to concede defeat in his bid to make the game that could prove to be a defining moment in United\u2019s already troubled season.\n\nSolskjaer is under increasing pressure, with United down in 12th place, already 15 points behind Liverpool and just two points off the relegation zone, after their worst start to a league campaign for 30 years.\n\nUnited have struggled for goals and creativity this season, which is why Solskjaer was desperate for Pogba to make the Liverpool game, to give his side some much-needed flair.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nDe Gea sustained his groin injury during Spain\u2019s 1-1 draw away to Sweden in a Euro 2020 qualifier, the 28-year-old forced off just after the second-half, after complaining of the problem at half-time.\n\nSergio Romero, United\u2019s No.2, will come into the side for his first league start of the season and only his third appearance of the campaign, with third-choice Lee Grant stepping up to the bench.", "description": "Manchester United take on bitter rivals Liverpool on Sunday without David de Gea or Paul Pogba", "authors": ["David Mcdonnell", "Image", "Richard Wainwright Epa-Efe Rex", "Anders Wiklund Tt Epa-Efe Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637195.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-Australia-pre-season-tour-Perth-16-Jul-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
