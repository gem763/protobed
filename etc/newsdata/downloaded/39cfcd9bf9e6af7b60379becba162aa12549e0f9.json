Biden, who has become a political rival.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Washington \u2014 where Democrats try to impeach President Trump for supposedly slow-walking aid for Ukraine and simultaneously filibuster the funding for the exact same Ukraine program here in the Senate. Welcome to Washington,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer called it \u201claughable\u201d to suggest Democrats are holding up money to Ukraine. The New York Democrat said it\u2019s false to accuse his side of the aisle of delaying the overall process.\n\nThe issue, he insisted, falls on the Republican leadership, which has not negotiated with Democrats on allocations to various agencies, accusing the Republican majority of taking funds from health programs and military families to pay for the president\u2019s border wall.\n\n\u201cDemocrats, of course, are not going to proceed to a defense bill that steals from our troops to pay for a border wall the American people don\u2019t want,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
