Greg Abbott says 142 charged suspects on requested immigration detainers were released from the Travis County jail during a one-week period last month.\n\nThe releases constituted nearly 70 percent of the 206 inmates freed nationally due to denial of detainer requests by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.\n\n\u201cThis is deeply disturbing and highlights the urgent need for a statewide sanctuary city ban in Texas,\u201d Abbott said.\n\n\u201cThe Travis County sheriff\u2019s decision to deny ICE detainer requests and release back into our communities criminals charged with heinous crimes \u2013 including sexual offenses against children, domestic violence and kidnapping \u2013 is dangerous and should be criminal in itself,\u201d the Republican governor said.\n\nMajor Wes Priddy, spokesman for the Travis County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said he could not confirm the 142 figure because no names were included in the ICE report cited by Abbott.\n\n\u201cI feel confident that most of those are still in custody,\u201d Priddy told Watchdog.org. He called the ICE report \u201canecdotal.\u201d\n\nPriddy said the sheriff\u2019s office formally notifies ICE when a detainer, or hold, is not honored.\n\nUnder an executive order by President Donald Trump, ICE now issues weekly accounting of detainers refused by local authorities.\n\nRep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, said he supports the administration\u2019s efforts \u201cto enforce laws that stop criminal immigrants from being released into the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cTravis County officials endanger innocent Texans when they release immigrants who have been convicted of crimes that include domestic violence, aggravated assault and DUIs,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 70 percent of violent offenders are arrested for a new crime within five years of release from jail or prison.\n\nThe Texas Senate has passed Senate Bill 4, which would penalize sanctuary cities. Withholding state grants and funding could cost Travis County tens of millions of dollars, according to a Watchdog report.\n\nKenric Ward writes for the Texas Bureau of Watchdog.org.
