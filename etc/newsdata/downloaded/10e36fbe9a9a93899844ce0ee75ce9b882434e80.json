It\u2019s a minefield for Trump in many ways to me, attacking somebody\u2019s family given what he does himself and what he has his family do,\u201d said Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see this as some kind of golden bullet that\u2019s going to hurt Biden and take him out in the primary process,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump\u2019s second-eldest son, Eric, who is helping run the president\u2019s business empire as executive vice president of The Trump Organization, wrote in an op-ed for The Hill on Thursday that media outlets would be all over him if he engaged in some of the same deals as Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cIf the situation were reversed, I would have been front page news in every newspaper, online publication, and cable news outlet for the rest of my life,\u201d Eric Trump wrote.\n\n\u201cReporters would be camping outside of my door, my family would have been picked apart, my name would have been smeared in the news every single week, and my father arguably would not even be president of the United States today,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut while some Republicans would like to see the media comb through Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings, others like Romney have expressed reluctance about making him and his father the target of official probes \u2014 a practice associated more with totalitarian regimes than the United States.\n\nTrump, however, has ignored those concerns and instead doubled down on his calls for the Bidens to be investigated.\n\nOn Thursday he caused an uproar when he declared \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThat statement sparked pushback from Sasse, who Trump has endorsed for reelection in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth. If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps,\u201d Sasse said in a statement to the Omaha World-Herald.", "description": "President Trump is pushing hard for an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, but the prospect of using the Oval Office to go after a\u00a0political rival is prompting some GOP senators to spe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/collinssuan_romneymitt_013119sr_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
