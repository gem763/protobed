When I started getting those chest pains, I didn\u2019t know what it was. I never experienced anything like that before. I keep myself in good health. It was scary. I wanted to leave the hospital right away.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t though. He had more tests, including a heart catheterization, before being cleared to return to the dugout a week ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I got all the tests done,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cEverything came back good. Now I don\u2019t have to think about it.\u201d\n\nIt was sort of like taking a team that was 19-31 after 50 games, on the brink of collapse and believing that by season\u2019s end they would be dancing to celebrate.\n\nThat\u2019s something Martinez, in his heart, always believed would happen.\n\n\u201cYes, I really believed that,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat the Nationals accomplished this season may be hard to put into perspective for fans, considering they\u2019ve seen their team win four division titles in seven years and now have added a wild card to that resume.\n\nThe Nationals came back from the dead after the first two months of the season to play the best baseball in the National League.\n\nGive Martinez his due. Not only did he refuse to let his team disintegrate, he accomplished something only eight other teams in the history of the game have done, fighting and clawing back from 12 games under .500 to reach the postseason.\n\nNot many thought he would be up to the task. In fact, not many believed he had what it took to be a major league manager. Martinez had been passed over for managing jobs with the Toronto Blue Jays, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros, Nationals (the first time, when they hired Matt Williams in 2014), Chicago Cubs and even his own team, the Tampa Bay Rays, after serving as the bench coach for Joe Maddon from 2008 to 2014.\n\nThe doubters complained when Martinez was hired to replace the popular Dusty Baker, fired after leading the Nationals to two NL East division titles and 95 and 97 wins.\n\nThe complaints got louder when Martinez\u2019s first year ended with an 82-80 record and reached a crescendo after this year\u2019s poor start and erratic play.\n\nBut in his heart, Martinez knew he could right the ship.\n\n\u201cI never doubted myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI always believed at some point I would be here.\n\n\u201cI knew I would be able to handle it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThe one thing I always hear from the players is they say, \u2018You never change \u2026 no matter what happens, you have conversations with us, you are always positive.\u2019 They appreciate that. I\u2019ve had many managers, and learned a lot from them, the good ones always stayed even-keeled, never rode the waves. Guys like Bobby Cox and Joe (Maddon), they always stayed the same and trusted what they believed in and led by what they believed in. You get the 25 guys to buy in? That\u2019s when you get that one heartbeat.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s that heart again \u2014 the key to Martinez\u2019s success. It took a lot of heart to stay positive despite the early struggles of this team and the furor that was building surrounding their failures.\n\n\u201cI sat in my office in New York (after a four-game sweep by the Mets put Washington at their 19-31 rock bottom),\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI got thrown out of the game, but I remember saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay. We\u2019re going to be all right. You watch.\n\n\u201cI can remember having meetings with my coaches when things were going bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to be positive. This is the time we need to step up. You\u2019ve got to make sure they know everything is going to be okay. Keep teaching. Once they see you are down, you lose them and that can\u2019t happen.\u2019 I\u2019m proud of the coaching staff. I\u2019m proud of the boys.\u201d\n\nThat message resonated inside a veteran clubhouse, but it was more than that. Players believed in Martinez\u2019s baseball acumen and saw him as more than simply a cheerleader \u2014 despite the outside criticism of his bullpen management.\n\nThat was the type of white noise you hear from keyboard managers everywhere in baseball.\n\nBraves fans regularly crucified Brian Snitker for his bullpen management, and it happens in nearly every market. It\u2019s the whine of the fan \u2014 and pundits as well. You are a bad manager because you brought in the wrong guy. You didn\u2019t bring in the right guy.\n\nIn Washington, there was no right guy.\n\nFor weeks, Martinez didn\u2019t have a bullpen worthy of managing. Even the reliable Doolittle struggled. Every decision seemed to be wrong because the choices in the bullpen were so few.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t 2017, when general manager Mike Rizzo made a midseason deal to give a beleaguered Baker a seventh, eighth and ninth inning bullpen in a matter of weeks with the trades to acquire Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nRizzo tried again this season by bringing in Roenis Ellis, Daniel Hudson and Hunter Strickland to stop the late-inning bleeding, but while Hudson has provided some stability, Strickland has been erratic and Ellis has been missing in action with hamstring problems.\n\nStill, Martinez managed to guide this team \u2014 with the worst bullpen in all of baseball \u2014 to the postseason and, as of Wednesday night, 89 wins.\n\n\u201cGive credit to Davey,\u201d Nationals starter Patrick Corbin said during Tuesday night\u2019s celebration. \u201cHe believed in us.\u201d\n\nMartinez always believed in himself as well, when it seemed no one else would. He knew in his heart what others did not.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
