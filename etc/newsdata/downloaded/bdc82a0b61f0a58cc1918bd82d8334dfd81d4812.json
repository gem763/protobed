Links to the other articles are below.)\n\nDividend-stock strategies have long been popular because of the correlation between steady increases of payouts and investment growth. But the low-and-declining interest-rate environment is setting the stage for attractive returns, especially for dividend stocks with value characteristics, according to John Buckingham, the editor of The Prudent Speculator.\n\nBuckingham did a special screen of stocks held within Prudent Speculator portfolios to narrow the group to 25 that meet additional criteria, as listed below. He also provided three- to five-year price targets for the group. That is in contrast to the 12-month targets and ratings used by most Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe Prudent Speculator is published by AFAM Capital, a division of Kovitz Investment Group of Chicago. AFAM Capital merged with Kovitz in October. AFAM manages about $700 million, mostly for private clients, while Kovitz\u2019s total assets under management exceed $5 billion.\n\nThe Prudent Speculator has the top 30-year performance ranking among newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest, with an average annualized return of 13.15% through July 30, compared with an average return of 9.66% for the S&P 500 Index SPX, -2.02% (including reinvested dividends), according to FactSet.\n\nIn an interview on Aug. 21, Buckingham said investors may have overreacted to the barrage of alarming reports saying the temporary inversion of the two-year and 10-year Treasury yield curve last week. Those comments are below.\n\nDividend stock screen\n\nHere\u2019s the list of 25 dividend stocks, in alphabetical order, screened from the 120 stocks held within Prudent Speculator portfolios:\n\nThe Prudent Speculator holds 120 stocks, selected using AFAM Capital\u2019s proprietary value methodology from a universe of about 2,700 stocks, including the 2,500 in the Russell 3000 RUA, -1.89% that have sufficient liquidity to hold trading costs down, and another 200 American depositary receipts (ADRs) of non-U.S. companies.\n\nBuckingham screened the stocks among those in Prudent Speculator portfolios that have dividend yields above the yields on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.81% using these criteria:\n\n\u2022 Minimum dividend yield of 2.2%.\n\n\u2022 Forward price-to-earnings ratio less than two-thirds of the current ratio of 17.7 for the S&P 500.\n\n\u2022 Negative total return over the past 12 months.\n\n\u2022 Pass additional proprietary \u201cquality\u201d screening to ensure all of the following:\n\nInexpensive backward-looking valuation metrics relative to peers.\n\nSolid credit rating or lower debt-to-equity level.\n\nNon-negative long-term growth outlook.\n\nEarnings over next year showing growth or only a very modest decline.\n\n\u2022 Significant long-term total return potential as calculated using a proprietary forward-looking valuation model.\n\nLooking at the dividend-stock list, there are four with dividend yields higher than 5%, with nine higher than 4% and 17 higher than 3.5%. The price-to-earnings ratios are low. In comparison, the S&P 500\u2019s trailing P/E is 18.5, and the forward P/E is 16.5, based on weighted aggregate consensus earnings estimates for the next 12 months among analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nSliding interest rates and more opportunity\n\nThe market yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.88% has fallen to 1.59% from 2.69% at the end of 2018 and the current yield is only slightly higher than the 1.57% yield on two-year Treasury notes TMUBMUSD02Y, -4.65%. Those yields inverted briefly last week, helping cause an 800-point decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Aug. 14. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.81% has dropped to 1.98% from 3.02% at the end of 2018.\n\nThe yield on 30-year Treasury paper is slightly lower than the weighted aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 Index, which is 2.01% according to FactSet. Consider that for a moment: Treasury yields may slide even further if the Federal Reserve continues to decrease the target range for the federal funds rate and the European Central Bank makes even more aggressive moves to prop up eurozone economies. Meanwhile, if you look to stocks for dividend income, you not only have competitive yields, you are also likely to see dividends increase over the years, with the added gravy of long-term growth potential.\n\nBack in May 2017, Buckingham said millennials were crazy not to be 100% invested in stocks. He may be even more enthusiastic about the stock market now: \u201cLow interest rates are extraordinarily supportive of equity prices. So I love it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen discussing stock valuations, Buckingham said it is very important to consider the interest-rate environment. The current forward P/E ratio of 16.5 for the S&P 500 compares to a ratio of 14.3 on Aug. 21, 2007. Comparisons of other valuations, including Robert Shiller\u2019s CAPE ratio, may also appear alarming. But 12 years ago the federal funds rate was 5.25%. Many investors were perfectly satisfied with that level of risk-free return.\n\nBack in May, in a CNBC interview, Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -1.86% CEO Warren Buffet said: \u201cI think stocks are ridiculously cheap if you believe ... that 3% on the 30-year bonds makes sense.\u201d Interest rates have fallen dramatically since then, and the S&P 500\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio has risen only slightly.\n\nInverted yield curve as a predictor of recessions\n\nBuckingham said investors (and, of course, the financial media) overreacted to the temporary inversion of yields for two-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes.\n\n\u201cThe 2/10 inversion has not been the biggest predictor of recession. The three-month and 10-year, which have been inverted since March, have been a better predictor,\u201d he said.\n\nBuckingham provided two charts showing how well the stock market has performed after the past eight yield inversions, before 2019:\n\nHere\u2019s how the S&P 500 has performed over various periods following an inversion of the three-month and 10-year yields:\n\nHere\u2019s how the index has performed following the past eight inversions of the two-year and 10-year Treasury yields:\n\nFor the two-year/10-year inversion, the market was higher 12 months later in all cases but one.\n\nNot to worry\n\nWhen asked if he was worried about the world already being awash with cash, with negative yields on so many trillions of dollars worth of European government bonds and interest rates heading lower in the U.S., even when these economies aren\u2019t in recession, Buckingham looked on the bright side.\n\n\u201dThe world does not care about the federal budget deficit and sees the U.S. as a safe haven. And the cost of debt has gone down. This is why Uncle Sam should issue 50- to 100-year debt,\u201d he said.\n\nNo matter how alarming central banks\u2019 policies may be, or how frightening the media headlines can be, as writers wonder when inflation will cause a major policy reversal or lament yield-curve inversions, \u201ceverything has been positive for stocks,\u201d Buckingham said.\n\nMore about dividend stocks in a world of low interest rates:\n\n\u2022 This dividend-stock strategy is for investors who want an attractive monthly income stream\n\n\u2022 Seeking attractive dividend stocks?
