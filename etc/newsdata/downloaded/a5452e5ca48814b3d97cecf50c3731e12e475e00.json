I mean, these clowns tried to put me in jail for three years because I took an unsolicited phone call. You know, the double standard is pretty sick, Brian. I\u2019ve talked about it for a long time. We can play one way, or we can play another way, but we\u2019ve got to be playing the same game. The reality is this: If Donald Trump Jr. flew on Air Force One with my father, the president, to China and came back with $1.5 \u2014not $1.5 billion, just $1.5\u2014we\u2019d solve the fake news media problem because their heads would explode.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThere is a double standard. If Donald Trump Jr. had a no-show gig on a corrupt Ukrainian oil company while my father was in charge of the issues over there\u2026 minor details. I\u2019ve never been in energy or oil. Minor details. I don\u2019t speak Ukrainian\u2026You think the press would have a problem with that, Brian?\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI had the media camped out in front of my apartment for two years. They don\u2019t even try to find this guy to even get a comment.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not a level playing field. And, so we have to fight fact accordingly.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Friday's edition of \"Brian Kilmeade Show,\" President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. criticized the media's \"double standard\" on Hunter Biden, the | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/DonJr103-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
