(Photo: Amy Newman, Northjersey.com/ USA TODAY Network)\n\nJoseph Elic, best known as the mental patient Bancini in 1975's classic drama \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" has died at age 98.\n\nHis manager Matt Beckoff confirmed the news on Facebook Thursday saying the actor's death in a New Jersey rehabilitation facility was the result of a recent fall.\n\nElic's Bancini was an oft-confused patient living in the Oregon mental facility in director Milos Foreman's \"Cuckoo's Nest,\" who would frequently lament, \"I'm tried.\" Bancini's iconic scene involved carrying Jack Nicholson's Randall P. McMurphy on his shoulders in an impromptu basketball lesson, a scene which the 6' 2\" Montana-born Elic said was ad-libbed.\n\nMore: The 10 greatest Oscar best-picture winners, ranked (yes, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is included)\n\nElic played a restaurant violinist who gets a bottle of champagne poured down his pants by Zero Mostel in Mel Brooks' 1967 comedy \"The Producers.\" It was on that film Elic met his lifelong friend Lee Meredith, who played Ulla.\n\nMeredith would become his caretaker in later years. Elic's last public appearance was with Meredith at an event commemorating the comedy in 2018.\n\nElic starred in two episodes of the original \"Twilight Zone\" TV series, playing an electrician in 1962's \"One More Pallbearer\" (1962) and a de-humanized Subaltern in \"The Obsolete Man\" (1961) alongside Burgess Meredith.\n\nThe fandom over \"Twilight Zone\" due to sci-fi conventions grew to be even larger than Elic's \"Cuckoo's Nest\" fandom.\n\nJack Nicholson shooting basket on the shoulders of Josip Elic as Will Sampson watches in a scene from the film 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', 1975.
