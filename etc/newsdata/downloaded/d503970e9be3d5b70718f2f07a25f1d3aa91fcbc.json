The amount you can claim depends on your destination and the length of your delay. The maximum is \u20ac600 (around \u00a3531) and the delay must have been within the airline\u2019s control. This includes routine technical faults. If a claim is rejected, contact the AviationADR or CEDR schemes. Jet2 and Ryanair are not signed up to either. The Civil Aviation Authority (caa.co.uk, 0330 022 1500) can handle complaints about these two airlines. Or try online dispute service Resolver. Your final option is to take the airline to the small claims court. Guide and letter to claim EU flight compensation here\n\nExperts warn that, with claims management companies no longer able to cash in on the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal, since the deadline passed last month, holidaymakers should expect a flood of calls and texts about flight delay compensation. Some firms are even targeting travellers on social media.\n\nBob, 66, and wife Caroline, 63, from Bristol, had flown to Corsica for ten days in June last year for their daughter Lucy's wedding.\n\nThe couple had been due to catch a plane home at 6.45am from Bastia airport, with their other daughter Amy, 36, son-in-law Dan, 33, and grandchildren Jasper, three, and Harvey, one. But, soon after arriving at the airport, they heard the flight was cancelled.\n\nThe family were loaded on to a minibus with other passengers and taken 93 miles to Ajaccio Napoleon Bonaparte Airport.\n\nThey were given no water on the three-hour drive and, after arriving at the airport, had to wait two hours before they could board a 6pm flight to Stansted.\n\nOnce back at home, Bob knew that they were entitled to compensation for the delay, but wasn't sure who to contact.\n\nWhen searching online, he stumbled across the Flight Delay Pay claims company. Thinking that using a professional firm would make the task easier, he filled in the online form for himself and the rest of the family in July last year.\n\nWhen the claim still hadn't been paid a month later, Bob began to chase the firm. But, 11 months on, he still hadn't had a payout.\n\nFlight Delay Pay insisted it was doing all it could on Bob's behalf.\n\nBut, in June this year, the firm emailed Bob to propose instructing debt collectors to chase his compensation from the airline, which would charge a 17 per cent fee if successful.\n\nThis would have been on top of the 25 per cent fee Flight Delay Pay intended to charge, plus an extra \u00a325 fee per passenger.\n\nBob, who works in the freight industry, did not want to pay any more towards the claim and so asked Money Mail to intervene on his behalf.\n\nThis newspaper went straight to the airline, Air Corsica, in June, which sent Bob a link to an online form so that he could claim the money himself. He received it within a week.\n\nBut now, he is facing legal action from the claims firm, which says he broke his contract with the company.\n\nBob says: 'Out of principle, I am not going to pay them, as I know I obtained that money myself.\n\n'I just feel that there wasn't a lot of effort put into pursuing the claim.'\n\nPredators: Increasing numbers of travellers are being targeted by claims firms offering to chase compensation on their behalf\n\nFlight Delay Pay claims that it had issued a court order against Air Corsica. However, the airline denies ever receiving this.\n\nOn its website, Flight Delay Pay, which is based in Lingfield, Surrey, and run by Paul Davidson, claims to have dealt with more than 5,000 claims since it was founded back in 2016. It also boasts that 70 per cent of its cases are settled within 30 days.\n\nMoney Mail identified 36 firms offering similar services to Flight Delay Pay across Europe.\n\nAt least half a dozen enforced similar terms banning customers from contacting airlines themselves once they have engaged the claims company.\n\nOne, Claim4Flights, based in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, states: 'The customer shall not pursue the claim personally nor shall it instruct any other third party to pursue the claim without the prior written approval of Claim4Flights.com.'\n\nComplaints against claims management companies were previously resolved by the Legal Ombudsman.\n\nIn April, the Financial Ombudsman took over this responsibility from City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, which pledged to protect customers from 'claims management cowboys'.\n\nSince then, the Ombudsman has received 290 enquiries about claims firms and upheld around 41 per cent of all complaints in favour of the customer.\n\nHowever, a loophole in the law means customers with complaints about claims firms dealing with flight delays cannot go to the Financial Ombudsman.\n\nThis is because, unlike companies that deal with claims relating to personal injury, financial services, housing repairs, benefits, criminal injury and employment, which are regulated, firms that manage flight delay claims are not.\n\nMartyn James, of complaints site Resolver, says: 'Disreputable claims managers have been targeting customers for huge cuts of their compensation, despite failing to do anything they promised.\n\n'Debt collectors and heavy-handed tactics are totally unacceptable, and it's time to clamp down on firms that fail to deliver.\n\n'Now that claims firms can no longer target customers who were mis-sold PPI, it's inevitable more are going to start moving into this area of delayed flights.'\n\nA Flight Delay Pay spokesman says the compensation delay was caused by Air Corsica failing to respond.\n\nHe says Flight Delay Pay's solicitors, PDT, won Bob's case and the claims firm instructed debt collectors when Air Corsica would not pay out.\n\nHe adds: 'We were even going to the expense of employing debt collectors so, clearly, we were doing our best.\n\n'[The clause] is in our terms and conditions and we sent an email to Mr Feltham on July 3, 2018, stipulating this is a condition of our appointment. He is aware we have written evidence on this point.'\n\nAn Air Corsica spokesman says: 'On February 21, 2019, we responded by email to a request made by post from the company PDT Solicitors, in favour of Mr Feltham, asking them to please send over the boarding passes; we never received an answer from PDT Solicitors.\n\n'The team paid Bob Feltham as he filled in the correct paperwork to process his refund.'\n\nf.parker@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "After enduring a 12-hour flight delay returning from his daughter's wedding in Corsica, Bob Feltham was eager to claim the \u00a31,335 his family was owed.", "authors": ["Fiona Parker For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
