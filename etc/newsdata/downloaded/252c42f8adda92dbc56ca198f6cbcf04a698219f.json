REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nUnder the Constitution, a president can be impeached for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2014 terminology that has been the subject of some debate.\n\nGerald Ford, a former U.S. president, famously said while in Congress that \u201can impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\u201d\n\nThe following explains how impeachable offences are generally understood under U.S. law.\n\nWhat is treason?\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, a person is guilty of treason if he or she goes to war against the United States or gives \u201caid or comfort\u201d to an enemy. Treason is the only crime specifically defined by the Constitution.\n\nThere is not a treason case to be made against Trump because the United States is not at war with Ukraine or Russia, said Paul Rosenzweig, a former federal prosecutor in Washington who worked on the special counsel investigation into Bill Clinton.\n\nWhat is bribery?\n\nA federal law, known as the bribery statute, makes it a crime for a public official like Trump to corruptly request a thing of value in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act.\n\nIn an impeachment investigation, House members are not required to adhere to the definition of bribery in the criminal code and can define the term more broadly to encompass corrupt uses of presidential authority for personal gain, legal experts said.\n\nRosenzweig said bribery could potentially be one of the \u201carticles of impeachment,\u201d or charges, returned against Trump if the House takes that step.\n\nWhat are \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d?\n\nAccording to several constitutional lawyers, \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d is a purposefully vague term and can be defined by members of Congress.\n\nWritings by the nation\u2019s founders make clear that they were concerned about presidents abusing the public trust, said Rosenzweig, now a senior fellow at the libertarian think tank R Street Institute.\n\n\u201cThe founders spoke about things like promising pardons to your friends to protect your own criminality,\u201d said Rosenzweig. \u201cThey spoke about things like people being beholden to foreign governments. They spoke about profiting from the presidency.\u201d\n\nSome legal experts say there is already a strong impeachment case against Trump based on what is publicly known about his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nOn that call, Trump said it \u201cwould be great\u201d if Zelenskiy could investigate claims that Biden, a presidential candidate, had tried, as vice president under former President Barack Obama, to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor who had investigated an energy company that employed his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump told his acting chief of staff to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before the phone call.\n\nBiden has confirmed he wanted the prosecutor fired. But no evidence has emerged that the former vice president did so to help his son. The wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired because of an alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases.\n\n\u201cTrump has already admitted the essentials \u2013 he called a foreign leader and asked him to use the legal engines of a foreign government to produce dirt on Trump\u2019s American political rival,\u201d said Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri who has written a book about impeachment.\n\nTrump said on Twitter on Tuesday that his call with Zelenskiy was \u201cvery friendly and totally appropriate,\u201d and that he put \u201cno pressure\u201d on the Ukrainian president.\n\nJack Sharman, a lawyer at Lightfoot, Franklin & White who has worked on impeachment investigations, said Trump\u2019s defense lawyers would likely argue in an impeachment proceeding that he has broad authority to control U.S. government money. But Sharman said lawmakers could overcome this argument.\n\nBowman said the question lawmakers must ask is whether Trump abused his official power as the primary agent of American foreign relations for private political gain.\n\n\u201cIf he did, and there was no plausible reason of state for his actions, that\u2019s impeachable,\u201d Bowman said.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nA common misconception about impeachment is that it refers to the removal of a president from office. In fact, impeachment refers only to the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress, bringing charges - similar to an indictment in a criminal case.\n\nA president is only removed if two-thirds of the Senate, the upper chamber, vote to find him guilty. That has never occurred in U.S. history, and is unlikely to happen to Trump because his Republican Party controls the Senate.", "description": "Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday announced a formal impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump, accusing him of enlisting foreign help to damage political rival Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433823300&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1LP", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
