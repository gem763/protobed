Behind starter Max Scherzer, the team kept its top three other starters \u2014 Stephen Strasburg, Patrick Corbin and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez \u2014 as well as five relievers: Fernando Rodney, Tanner Rainey, Hunter Strickland, fireman Daniel Hudson and closer Sean Doolittle. Wander Suero led the team with 78 appearances, and Manager Dave Martinez always expressed confidence in him, but the young right-hander will be inactive. Suero had a 4.63 ERA this month while Rainey hasn\u2019t allowed a run in his past 7\u2153 innings and Strickland, despite some rocky outings, had posted three straight holds.\n\nColumnist Barry Svrluga: How Dave Martinez should manage the Nationals\u2019 bullpen tonight, and how he shouldn't\n\nThe Brewers believe that, once Scherzer exits, the Nationals will use Strasburg and Corbin, in that order, if Corbin isn\u2019t needed earlier for a lefty-lefty matchup. One of the weaknesses of the Nationals\u2019 bullpen is that the left-handed specialist they traded for at the deadline, Roenis El\u00edas, is out with a hamstring injury, leaving Corbin and Doolittle as the team\u2019s only left-handers. All this said, the Nationals hope to need, at most, Scherzer, Strasburg, Corbin, Hudson and Doolittle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSanchez is on the active roster, but he\u2019s likely an option only if the game goes to extra innings. The Nationals obviously need to win Tuesday to advance, but they also don\u2019t want to leave themselves without a tested starter for a possible Game 1 of the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nCarrying only nine pitchers is a gamble, but it\u2019s one the Nationals are willing to take. They gave themselves every possible option off the bench with a third catcher (Raudy Read) as well as two pinch-run/pinch-hit candidates (Michael A. Taylor and Andrew Stevenson). The team has not released its starting lineup, and all Martinez has said for sure is that Kurt Suzuki will start behind the plate and Juan Soto will bat fourth, but there are a few other reasonable expectations.\n\nNationals and Brewers enter NL wild-card game with different plans to get 27 outs\n\nTrea Turner will play shortstop and lead off, Adam Eaton will hit second and play right field, Anthony Rendon will play and hit third, and Soto will play left field. After that, things get murkier. Howie Kendrick will likely start at first base and switch-hitting Asdrubal Cabrera at second. This leaves two right-handed bench bats (Ryan Zimmerman and Brian Dozier) as well as two left-handed ones (Matt Adams and Gerardo Parra). The order is unclear, though if Kendrick and Cabrera bat in that order, it maintains the Nationals\u2019 natural left-right lineup which limits bullpen-matchup effectiveness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe versatility for the Nationals is important because the game is a study in contrasting pitching styles. While the Nationals try to get 27 outs by riding their workhorses \u2018til they can\u2019t anymore, the Brewers will still match up as much as possible.\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s catchers have a story to tell\n\n\u201cTeams have to play to their strengths [and take advantage of their personnel],\u201d Milwaukee Manager Craig Counsell said Monday. \u201cOur depth and our numbers are what makes our pitching good, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to treat games.\u201d\n\nThe Brewers\u2019 Brandon Woodruff will make his third start since missing two months with an oblique injury and likely remain on something of a pitch count. He exited his first two starts after nearly 40 pitches. Their bullpen is deep and diverse with three versatile and dominant left-handers in Josh Hader, Brent Suter and Drew Pomeranz. Their top high-leverage right-handers are Junior Guerra and Jay Jackson.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 lineup somewhat naturally counters matchups with its left-right balance, and Eaton expressed confidence Monday that his team wouldn\u2019t be overwhelmed the Brewers\u2019 trio of lefties.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very good, but the good thing is we\u2019re a strong righty group,\u201d he said. \u201cMe and Soto are the only lefties [in the starting lineup]. That\u2019s a strength for us against left-handed pitching. I think we\u2019d do quite well against [Brewers lefties].\u201d\n\nAnd, if they don\u2019t, the Nationals have options on the bench. This roster essentially lets them play the matchup game, too.\n\nRead more:\n\nNew York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\nThe 12 best moments from the Nationals\u2019 wild 2019 season\n\nCharting the wildest season in Nationals history\n\nNationals\u2019 Dave Martinez on recent heart procedure: \u2018I was so, so scared\u2019\n\nBoswell: Sharks are chomping at Nationals Park, and I think we\u2019re going to need a bigger bandwagon\n\nSvrluga: With a playoff history full of nightmares, the Nats enter this year eyes wide open\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s approach to his last 15 pitches explains everything about him\n\nAD", "description": "The Nationals know an army of Brewers relievers are coming, so they stacked their bench with bats to counter them.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AHpz7gAUlz7SompsCr35P-dtPc4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X2SYXMXDTAI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
