His previous lawyer, John Sale, was helping him deal with congressional inquiries.\n\n\u201cIf they take me to court I would then have to get another lawyer,\u201d Giuliani told CNN\u2019s Mike Warren on October 15\u2026\n\nGiuliani asserted in a tweet on Wednesday night that \u201ceverything I did was to discover evidence to defend my client against false charges. Dems would be horrified by the attacks on me, if my client was a terrorist. But they don\u2019t believe @realDonaldTrump has rights.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Rudy-Giuliani-Defense-Attorney Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
