REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nYet, for many businesses the FTZs have simply failed to live up to their hype, undermined in part by Beijing\u2019s capital controls as an escalating trade war with the United States slows China\u2019s economic growth to 30-year lows.\n\nBack in Shanghai, in the first FTZ area, chairs lie overturned and desks sit empty behind padlocked glass office doors. Food courts that once overflowed with business diners have seen small eateries steadily shut up shop this year, leaving used chopsticks and plastic packaging scattered on the ground.\n\nWhile the Shanghai FTZ, opened in September 2013, has long struggled to live up to its initial promise of free-flowing currency and easier international trade, more businesses are increasingly deserting the 28.78 square kilometre Waigaoqiao zone.\n\nChina Merchants Bank, now the country\u2019s fifth largest by assets and profits, disbanded a 10-strong FTZ corporate business team at the end of last year, said two people with knowledge of the situation, spreading the staff among other branches after the lender found that the FTZ\u2019s promised benefits were rendered useless as capital controls tightened.\n\nMoreover, according to several bankers, hundreds of specialized accounts lie untouched across the FTZ as capital controls and regulatory scrutiny make free movement of currency \u2013 the hot selling point of the zone \u2013 untenable.\n\nThe people could not be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nCMB did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Shanghai government said the authority was not aware of the capital control snags.\n\n\u201cThe FTZs have reduced opportunities for local government taxes and also contradict Beijing\u2019s attempt to reduce capital flight,\u201d said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.\n\n\u201cThere are many conflicting desires in the FTZ \u2013 and they can\u2019t be as effective ultimately as Beijing would hope,\u201d he said, adding that the same issues will affect the new FTZs.\n\nLESS TRADE ZONE?\n\nThe idea in 2013 was that an onshore yuan account opened in a free trade zone bank branch could be used as if it were already offshore, meaning it could be exchanged, or used in payment free of domestic restrictions.\n\nBut bankers found the reality far from the hype and as concerns over capital flight led regulators to clamp down on yuan leaving the country from 2015, usability deteriorated further.\n\nUsers of an FTZ account \u201chave to tick more than 40 boxes before they conduct one transaction. After all the due diligence, the FTZ account is no longer convenient,\u201d said Ding Jianping, professor at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.\n\n\u201cConvenience, and the concept of auto transaction used to be the selling point,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd even though Beijing plans to expand the zones, capital controls will remain strict for the foreseeable future, meaning the FTZ is unlikely to improve for lenders.\n\nThere are currently 119 finance firms in Shanghai with a registered office including the words \u201cfree trade zone\u201d, according to a data grab on Qichacha, an information provider that uses official company registration sources.\n\nOut of the 119 finance firms, only 3 currently have a Waigaoqiao area address.\n\nShanghai Huarui Bank shut its Waigaoqiao branch back in 2015, only to open another in a different part of the free trade zone when the government expanded the pilot area. While the new branch is still handling FTZ business, the prospect for growth is losing steam, said a person with direct knowledge.\n\nThe Bank of Ningbo currently has four branches in the FTZ, but while they\u2019re still expanding, most of the work done is normal banking business.\n\nEach transaction in connection with a free trade account needs to be reported, and money inside cannot be transferred to an ordinary account, \u201cwhich makes the account useless,\u201d said a person who works at one of the FTZ branches.\n\nIn one of the four FTZ branches of the Bank of Ningbo, there are between 20 to 30 FTZ accounts and they are rarely used, she said.\n\nOver at the Bank of Nanjing, management is not keen on expanding the FTZ business, said a person who works in the zone branch.\n\nThe bank is unable to offer products that would really assist a client, said the person, such as an offshore loan without onshore deposits due to risk controls and regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe FTZ business is \u201cto fulfil targets set by the government\u201d and not because there is real opportunity, the person added.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nShanghai Huarui Bank, Bank of Ningbo and the Bank of Nanjing did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nWhile for banks, the FTZ has not been a golden goose, firms in other industries say reforms, such as the streamlining of registration procedures have made it easier to do business.\n\nAnd the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China and Bank of Shanghai said they still engage actively in FTZ business in their annual reports.", "description": "When China launched the expansion of the Shanghai free trade zone (FTZ) recently and announced six new FTZs in July, officials touted the efforts to attract foreign investment and deepen trade ties with neighbouring countries.", "authors": ["Engen Tham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425229298&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8101P"}
