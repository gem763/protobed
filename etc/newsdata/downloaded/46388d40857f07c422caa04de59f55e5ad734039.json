Chuck Grassley is warning the White House that it cannot legally appoint Ken Cuccinelli to lead the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nPresident Trump is seeking an end-around to appoint the immigration hardliner to the position, and Cuccinelli is loathed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republicans to the point that he probably could not be confirmed. And Grassley, the most senior Republican, said under the Vacancies Act there's no legal way to put the acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services chief in the position as acting chief after acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan leaves his post on Thursday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some opposition to Senate confirmation. I have not heard anything about some go-around. But it\u2019s my understanding that the existing law would not permit him to\u201d lead the organization, Grassley said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get around that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible because of what the law says, not because of anything else.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/77/0b/3d9c661d498dafc68b526241a1fa/191030-chuck-grassley-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
