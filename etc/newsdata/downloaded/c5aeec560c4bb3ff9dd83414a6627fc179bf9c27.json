There's a difference.\" pic.twitter.com/oLlpls8puJ\u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 25, 2019\n\nFormer Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton were among several prominent politicians who honored Elijah Cummings at a funeral Friday for the longtime Maryland congressman in Baltimore.\n\nObama praised Cummings in his eulogy as a man of great integrity and honor.\n\n\u201cElijah Cummings came from good soil,\u201d Obama said, recalling the 12-term House representative being raised by parents who were sharecroppers. \u201cAnd in this sturdy frame, goodness took root.\u201d\n\nObama called Cummings\u2019 parents the \u201cproverbial salt of the earth\u201d and said they \u201cpassed on that strength and that grit \u2014 but also that kindness and that faith to their son.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that Cummings didn\u2019t wait for better times, but became a lawyer \u201cto make sure that others had rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cElijah\u2019s example: the son of parents who rose from nothing to carve out just a little something, a public servant who toiled to guarantee the least of us have the same opportunities that he had earned, a leader who once said he\u2019d die for his people even as he lived every minute for them,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cHis life validates the things we tell ourselves about what\u2019s possible in this country, not guaranteed, but possible. The possibility that our destinies are not preordained but rather, through our works and our dedication and our willingness to open our hearts to God\u2019s message of love for all people, we can live a purposeful life.\u201d\n\nHe said Cummings imparted the lesson that \u201cbeing a strong man includes being kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing weak about kindness and compassion. There\u2019s nothing weak about looking out for others. There\u2019s nothing weak about being honorable. You\u2019re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect,\u201d he added. \u201cIt now falls on us to continue his work.\u201d\n\nCummings died Oct. 17 at age 68 due to complications from cancer. He lay in state at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, the first black U.S. lawmaker to receive the honor. Friday\u2019s service was held at Baltimore\u2019s New Psalmist Baptist Church, where Cummings attended services for almost 40 years.\n\n\u201cWe all know now that at least until certain things happen, his legacy is how ardently he honored his oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cI love this man. I loved every minute I ever spent with him. I love every conversation we have had.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the service, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings called her husband a man of the \u201cutmost integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had to work to fight for the soul of our country against very real corruption,\u201d she said in her eulogy. \u201cIt got infinitely more difficult in the last months of his life when he sustained personal attacks and attacks on his city.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also spoke at Friday\u2019s service.\n\n\u201cOur Elijah was a huge champion for truth, justice and kindness in every part of his life,\u201d she said.\n\nBishop Walter S. Thomas Jr., who has served as the church\u2019s pastor since 1975, said he expected mourners at the service numbered in the thousands.\n\n\u201cFor all those who pass through these doors, it has been very somber,\u201d Thomas told The Baltimore Sun. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a friend, a loved one, a member, a role model. You can roll out the whole list of nouns. He steps into all of them with big shoes.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Cummings lay in repose at Baltimore\u2019s Morgan State University, where he delivered the commencement address in May.\n\n\u201cYour lives are in front of you,\u201d he told the graduating class at the historically black research university. \u201cAnd so I beg you to go out and stand up for this democracy.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 25 (UPI) \u2014 .@BarackObama on the word 'honorable': \"This is a title that we confer on all kinds of people who get elected to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
