The afternoon singles matches were split at the noisy, 17,000-seat Palexpo arena.\n\n\u201cThanks Sascha, for carrying me in that second set,\u201d Federer told his playing partner in an on-court interview.\n\nThe six-man Europe team has a big advantage in ATP rankings, and No. 5 Dominic Thiem started the day by beating the 33rd-ranked Shapovalov 6-4, 5-7, 13-11. Shapovalov let three match points slip in the decisive third set which is played as a super-tiebreaker.\n\nSock, whose rankings fell into the 200s in an injury-hit season, then leveled the three-day event by winning 6-1, 7-6 (3) against No. 11 Fabio Fognini.\n\nEurope, captained courtside by Bjorn Borg, regained the lead when No. 7 Stefanos Tsitsipas won 6-2, 1-6, 10-7 against 30th-ranked Taylor Fritz for the world team led by John McEnroe.\n\nFederer is back on court before another sold-out crowd Saturday, when he will play Nick Kyrgios in the afternoon\u2019s second match.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fresh, I\u2019m ready to go for more,\u201d said Federer, who co-owns the Laver Cup competition.\n\nSaturday\u2019s play opens with Zverev playing John isner. Rafael Nadal enters the stage for Europe in an evening singles against Milos Raonic, then stays on to partner Tsitsipas against Kyrgios and Sock.\n\nVictories Saturday in the three singles matches and one doubles are worth two points each. Sunday\u2019s matches score three points for the winning team and 13 points are needed to lift the title.\n\nEurope seeks a third straight win in the Laver Cup. It was launched two years ago in Prague, then moved to Chicago last year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Roger Federer teamed up with Alexander Zverev in doubles to lift Europe into a commanding 3-1 lead over the world team on the first day of the Laver Cup on Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/switzerland_tennis_laver_cup_40456_c0-143-3427-2141_s1770x1032.jpg?2da9f1819d70cc8364d0e36cc97d2ddc40fdce8c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
