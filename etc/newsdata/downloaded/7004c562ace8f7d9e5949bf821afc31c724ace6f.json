She says the dogs refused to let go of Ronelle and two police officers on the scene had to shoot them to get them off her.\n\nShe was taken to the Netcare Hospital Polokwane where doctors have begun to treat her most serious wounds.\n\nThe dogs had pulled off her scalp and she sustained serious bites on her arms and legs. Ronelle will have to undergo plastic surgery to repair the damage to her scalp. A large bite on her leg will also require surgery.\n\n\u201cShe needs immediate treatment for her injuries \u2013 treatment she won\u2019t necessarily receive at a state hospital,\u201d Tess says.\n\n\u201cRonelle doesn\u2019t have medical aid and we\u2019re struggling to raise funds to keep her in a private hospital.
