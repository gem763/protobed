USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014 As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump's contact with the Ukrainian president, multiple 2020 Democratic presidential candidates switched their view on where they stand with impeachment or reiterated their belief that impeachment is the right path.\n\nHere are where the 2020 Democratic candidates currently stand on impeaching the president:\n\nMichael Bennet\n\nThe senator from Colorado has called for more investigation into the president's conduct and said Tuesday night that the \"House is right to launch an impeachment inquiry ... This administration cannot hide the truth.\"\n\nJoe Biden\n\nThe former vice president has been trading words with Trump over the controversy, and on Tuesday called on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings if Trump does not comply with all of Congress\u2019 request for information about the July call Trump had with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\n\"It's time for this administration to stop stonewalling and provide the Congress with all the facts it needs,\" Biden said. \"It's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president. The president should stop stonewalling this investigation and all the other investigations into his alleged wrongdoing. Using its full Constitutional authority, Congress in my view should demand the information it has a legal right to receive.\u201d\n\nCory Booker\n\nThe senator from New Jersey said Pelosi's move forward is \"our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served,\" and has been a long time supporter of impeachment.\n\nSteve Bullock\n\nThe Montana governor called on Congress to demand the whistleblower\u2019s complaint that has in part led to the impeachment inquiry, saying in a statement if \"they don\u2019t get it, I see no other option than starting impeachment proceedings.\"\n\nI see no other option. pic.twitter.com/mmrGBCjJM9 \u2014 Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) September 24, 2019\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nThe South Bend, Indiana, mayor continued his previously stated support of impeachment, using the news Tuesday to encourage his supporters to register to vote on National Registration Day via twitter.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\n\nThe former Housing and Urban Development secretary has long supported impeachment, and retweeted singer Lizzo cleverly tweeting \u201cIM[peach emoji]MENT\u201d with: Truth hurts, a nod to Lizzo's smash hit single.\n\nJohn Delaney\n\nThe former congressman had previously supported Pelosi waiting on an official impeachment inquiry and again followed the Speaker Tuesday, saying in a statement he believes Pelosi has \u201cexercised extremely good judgment\u201d and he agrees with her, reiterating that \u201cshe deserves our support.\u201d\n\nTulsi Gabbard\n\nRepresentative Tulsi Gabbard went against the tide of her fellow 2020 contenders on impeachment, saying she doesn\u2019t support it because it would be \"terribly divisive\" for an \"already very divided\" country.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris\n\nThe California senator tweeted out a petition before Pelosi had announced formal proceedings, asking supporters to sign if they want to see movement towards impeachment.\n\n\"As a 2016 candidate, Donald Trump openly encouraged a foreign adversary to hack a political opponent and attack our elections. As President, he's doing it again in broad daylight. We cannot stand for this abuse of power,\" the petition reads.\n\nTrump openly encouraged a foreign adversary to hack a political opponent and attack our elections.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s doing it again.\n\n\n\nAdd your name to demand the House begin proceedings to impeach Trump\u00bbhttps://t.co/g6aouA7Zu2 \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 24, 2019\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nThe Minnesota senator tweeted that \u201cthe House did the right thing,\u201d maintaining her previously stated support for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nWayne Messam\n\nThe Miramar, Florida, mayor tweeted Tuesday that \"Many folks continue to demand impeachment proceedings for @POTUS, I\u2019m on record as well.\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke\n\nThe former congressman from Texas on Twitter called on his former colleagues to simply \u201cfinish the job and impeach him.\u201d\n\nWe have a lawless president, who has undermined our democracy; a racist president, who has incited violence; a reckless president, who has let our planet burn and fleeced taxpayers for his own benefit. To my former colleagues in Congress: Finish the job and impeach him. \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 24, 2019\n\nTim Ryan\n\nThe congressman from Ohio took to twitter to say: \"Donald Trump showed us again that his true colors are more like a mob boss than a president. It\u2019s time to impeach.\"\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nThe Vermont senator tweeted Tuesday he believes Trump \u201cis the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nHe also said Tuesday he fears that if impeachment fails in the Senate, \u201cI know and you know what [Trump] will do: \u2018I am vindicated! \u2026 I am vindicated!\u2019 And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration.\u201d\n\nJoe Sestak\n\nThe former congressman and Naval officer said that if the allegations against Trump are true, \"the constitutional duty of Congress is to investigate the outreach of America\u2019s leader.\"\n\nTom Steyer\n\nThe billionaire reiterated his support for the impeachment movement. Steyer began calling for impeachment two years ago to \u201chold this lawless, criminal president accountable. We are finally at a watershed moment.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nThe Massachusetts Senator reiterated her longtime belief in impeaching the president, tweeting a video of her speaking on the floor of the Senate in May where she said \"Congress must fulfill its Constitutional duty & begin impeachment proceedings against the President.\" She also said \"when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.\"\n\nI said it on the floor of the US Senate in May & I\u2019ll say it again: Congress must fulfill its Constitutional duty & begin impeachment proceedings against the President. Nobody is above the law \u2013 not even the President of the United States. pic.twitter.com/S5uNJyiQNK \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 24, 2019\n\nMarianne Williamson: Williamson said Tuesday that she had previously been unsure of an impeachment inquiry because of the GOP stronghold on the Senate, as well as Trump possibly using the inquiry \u201cmake himself look like a victim.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cwhen a president has no qualms withholding aid from another country unless its government agrees to help him get dirt on his political opponents, America has a serious problem,\" the author said in a statement. \"Our president has apparently no respect for the demands, responsibilities, or the limits to his power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is with no pleasure that I support an impeachment inquiry into the president. It is, however, with a deep belief that it is the right thing to do,\u201d she added.\n\nAndrew Yang: Yang came forward on Tuesday via Twitter to say he now believes \u201cimpeachment is the right path forward. Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency\u2019s inquiry is egregious,\u201d but clarified that if impeachment doesn\u2019t work in the Republican Senate, he plans to \u201cbeat Donald Trump at the ballot box in 2020.\u201d\n\nGiven the President\u2019s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward. Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency\u2019s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cSometimes you do the right thing independent of politics,\u201d he continued.\n\nPresident Trump, for his part, has called the latest push for impeachment a \u201cpositive for me in the election.\u201d\n\nTrump's campaign manager Brad Parscale called the Democrats impeachment strategy \"misguided.\"\n\n\u201cDemocrats can\u2019t beat President Trump on his policies or his stellar record of accomplishment, so they\u2019re trying to turn a Joe Biden scandal into a Trump problem,\" Parscale said in a statement.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/24/election-2020-where-do-2020-democrats-stand-trump-impeachment/2435355001/", "description": "As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced\u00a0a formal impeachment inquiry, multiple 2020 democratic candidates have switched their view on  impeachment.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
