Can Do Better Than Him", "language": "en", "text": "From Cosmopolitan\n\nDylan Barbour clapped back at a fan who said Hannah Godwin can do better than him.\n\nDylan and Hannah have been getting serious on Bachelor in Paradise since she chose him over Blake Horstmann.\n\nThere\u2019s one more episode of Bachelor in Paradise left and tensions are running high! Well, they are for some people. Dylan Barbour, on the other hand, is taking everything in stride and even just called out a troll in the most chill way possible.\n\nFor the most part, since Hannah Godwin finally decided that she\u2019d rather spend time with Dylan than with Blake Horstmann and deal with all that Stagecoach drama, Dylan\u2019s time in paradise has been smooth sailing. And now that they\u2019ve made it to the last week, it\u2019s time for them to really think about their future.\n\nEnter: unsolicited opinions by a BiP fan who thinks they know what Hannah G. needs more than she actually does.\n\nIn an exchange caught by the Comments by Bachelor Instagram account, one fan commented on a video of Hannah G. explaining one of her favorite moments in Paradise, which was when Dylan mispronounced \u201cI love Hannah\u201d in Spanish and said, \u201cMy name is Hannah\u201d instead. It was a cute video and most of the comments on it were positive, except for the one that said, \u201cYou could do so much better than Dylan! You need a MAN!\u201d which is obviously extremely rude and the way she capitalized man is very sus.\n\nDylan, who is arguably one of the funniest Bachelor Nation peeps on the \u2019gram, clapped back with, \u201cYou tell her, Lauren,\u201d which pretty much squashed a mini feud before it even started.\n\nThe finale of Bachelor in Paradise is tonight, and Dylan and Hannah seem to be going pretty strong, so in just a few hours, we\u2019ll find out if they actually got engaged. If you don\u2019t schedule your life around BiP, you can just see who will probably get engaged by reading these Reality Steve spoilers.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Please!
