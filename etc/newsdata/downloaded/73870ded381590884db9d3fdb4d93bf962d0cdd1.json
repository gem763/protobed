USD/\n\nA U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Thursday released a\n\ndeclassified version of a whistleblower report alleging that\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his office to solicit interference\n\nin the 2020 presidential election from a foreign country.\n\nThe fresh developments in an inquiry into the impeachment of\n\nTrump sent U.S. stock indexes and Treasury yields lower\n\noffseting positive trade signals from China. Earlier in the day, Beijing said it was in close\n\ncommunication with the United States and was preparing to make\n\nprogress with their trade talks in October. \"The weakening global economic data and political risks\n\nshould keep stimulus strong from the U.S. Federal Reserve,\n\nEuropean Central Bank and People's Bank of China,\" Edward Moya,\n\na senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note.\n\n\"Once this consolidation period ends, we could see gold\n\ntarget the $1,600 level.\"\n\nU.S. business investment contracted more sharply than\n\npreviously estimated in the second quarter and corporate profit\n\ngrowth was tepid, casting a shadow on an economy that is being\n\nstalked by financial market fears of a recession. \"We continue to be in the opinion that global growth signals\n\nare still weakening and the question is will that sap into the\n\nUnited States and prompt the Fed to cut rates more aggressive\n\nthan the market currently anticipating,\" TD Securities' Ghali\n\nsaid.\n\nGold tends to appreciate on expectations of lower interest\n\nrates, which reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding\n\nbullion.\n\nOn the technical front, spot gold is likely to fall to\n\n$1,488 an ounce after breaking support at $1,514, said Reuters\n\ntechnical analyst Wang Tao.
