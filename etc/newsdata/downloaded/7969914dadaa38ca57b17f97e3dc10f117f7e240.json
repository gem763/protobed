Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nHouse Democrats try to move the needle on impeachment\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump acknowledged that he discussed former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter during a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis admission came amid renewed pressure on House Democrats to begin impeachment hearings over allegations that the president had leaned on foreign governments to investigate one of his potential 2020 opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shift in sentiment right now,\u201d says congressional reporter Rachael Bade . \u201cI started seeing on Friday, for the first time ever, a bunch of House Democrats go on record and say: We look weak. We look feckless. We are undermining our own branch of government by not sticking up to Trump.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been unwilling to press for impeachment but on Sunday called for the director of national intelligence to turn over the whistleblower complaint detailing Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine. She stopped short, however, of threatening impeachment if the administration refuses to comply.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nChina cracks down on Hui Muslims\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, China\u2019s government has intensified its efforts to \u201cSinicize\u201d the country, or make a more homogenous, secular China. Authorities have targeted ethnic minorities to curtail religions, such as Islam, that they consider to be carriers of foreign influence.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor two years on the Xinjiang frontier, China has sent hundreds of thousands of Uighurs to what it calls \u201creeducation centers,\u201d where they are taught to renounce their religion and culture and embrace new state-prescribed identities as secular Chinese.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the government has accelerated its campaign to target another Muslim minority, says China correspondent Gerry Shih : the Hui.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c[Xi Jinping] has wanted to make China great again through what he calls the China Dream,\u201d Shih says. This campaign is part of that \u201clong-foretold rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018You really want to believe in those things\u2019\n\n\u201cPeople ask me my favorite movie and I want to say \u2018The Shawshank Redemption,\u2019 but it\u2019s also kind of a cliche favorite movie,\u201d says Style features editor Zachary Pincus-Roth . \u201cIt\u2019s the number-one movie on IMDb in terms of user rankings, so me saying \u2018The Shawshank Redemption\u2019 is my favorite movie \u2014 well, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite movie.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it may be. Twenty-five years after it failed in the box office, \u201cShawshank\u201d has emerged as an unlikely entry in the contest for the most beloved movie of all time. It\u2019s one that\u2019s inspired tattoos and moved fans to make pilgrimages to the town in Ohio that once pretended to be a town in Maine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think part of it was how this movie was just arguing for all of the good things in life to win out in the end,\u201d Pincus-Roth says, \u201cfor justice and kindness, and making the most of your life, and hope, and all of these things. And so I think the movie was sort of aspirational in that way, at least for me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Rachael Bade explains whether impeachment is on the table after a whistleblower complaint.
