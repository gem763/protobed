Pitching for one of the best teams in the American League doesn\u2019t hurt, but Miley holds an impressive 3.06 ERA with a 7.73 K/9 rate that outpaces his career average. The 32-year-old southpaw could continue to pad his stats in this home matchup against Seattle, who ranks 20th in wRC+ through the second half of the season. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the Mariners\u2019 lineup is diluted with young players as we head down the final stretch, which is something that could play into Miley\u2019s favor. The Astros represent comfortable -280 home favorites, and Miley is a strong lift within that.\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Quintana, Max Fried\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nJi-Man Choi - Tampa Bay (vs. Toronto)\n\nStory continues\n\nChoi is an affordable first baseman who will help you reach for top-dollar picks at other positions. He\u2019ll settle into a strong matchup against Toronto RHP Trent Thornton, who carries an inflated .348 wOBA split to left-handed hitters. It doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise that Tampa checks in with one of the highest-scoring projections of the night, and Choi represents a solid bargain lift from that.\n\nAlso Consider: Yuli Gurriel, Josh Bell, Sam Travis\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nAdam Frazier - Pittsburgh (vs. Miami)\n\nFrazier is on fire at the moment, racking up 14 hits with two homers, seven runs, and seven RBIs over his last six games. I\u2019m expecting him to keep that torrid pace while facing Miami RHP Elieser Hernandez, who currently sports a .385 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Teammates like Josh Bell, Colin Moran, and Bryan Reynolds are prime candidates to jump on that vulnerability as well.\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Altuve, Luis Arraez\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nAbraham Toro - Houston (vs. Seattle)\n\nHouston and Boston represent the highest-scoring projections of the night (followed by Tampa). Toro checks in as a tempting bargain lift within a healthy Astros\u2019 stack against Seattle LHP Marco Gonzales, who took a step back after allowing seven hits and five earned runs (5.2 IP) at Texas last Friday. Toro is only hitting .222 through 10 games this season, but he keeps finding a way to reach base and score fantasy points regardless. The rookie has scored seven runs with one steal and two homers over his past seven outings. That power/speed combination could come in handy again tonight.\n\nAlso consider: Colin Moran, Joey Wendle\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nJonathan Villar - Baltimore (vs. Texas)\n\nThe Orioles aren\u2019t playing for much with a 46-93 record, but you better believe Villar will keep trying to pad his stats throughout the rest of the season. The Baltimore shortstop has been one of the few bright spots of this team, as he currently holds a respectable .280 average with 20 homers and 33 steals. Left-handed starting pitcher Kolby Allard of Texas is far from a pushover, but this is certainly a winnable matchup for Villar. Take note that the Rangers bullpen ranks 20th in xFIP (4.76) as well. No matter how you slice it, Villar makes his case as a solid fantasy shortstop with a discount compared to guys like Alex Bregman and Xander Bogaerts.\n\nAlso Consider: Alex Bregman, Xander Bogaerts\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nJ.D. Martinez - Boston (vs. Minnesota)\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned it several times through this article series, but J.D. Martinez carries the best splits against left-handed pitching (246 wRC+, .544 wOBA) this season. Actually, it\u2019s not even close, as the Boston slugger blows the competition out of the water in that respect. That\u2019s why I\u2019m all over Martinez against struggling Minnesota LHP Martin Perez, who currently holds a vulnerable .369 wOBA split to right-handed bats. Perez has been shaky over the past three months, reaching a low point after giving up seven earned runs through 2.2 innings against the lowly Tigers last week. Martinez and company should jump all over him in hitter-friendly Fenway Park.\n\nKevin Kiermaier - Tampa Bay (vs. Toronto)\n\nKiermaier makes a strong case for fantasy consideration tonight. The matchup, salary, and overall profile create a recipe for success that blends favorably into most lineup configurations. As mentioned earlier, Toronto RHP Thornton holds an inflated .345 wOBA split to left-handed bats, and Kiermaier could take advantage with respectable upside for multiple hits to go along with some power and speed.\n\nAlso consider: Mookie Betts, Eddie Rosario, Austin Meadows, Tommy Pham, Bryan Reynolds, Jake Cave, Harold Ramirez (punt)", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for the evening slate (7:05 ET) on Thursday, September 5.
