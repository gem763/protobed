Japan says the issue of compensation was settled under a 1965 treaty.\n\nThe dispute has rippled through security cooperation over North Korea, with Seoul deciding to scrap a military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, inviting criticism from both Tokyo and Washington.\n\nYoo said South Korean firms are \u201cfaced with serious damage\u201d as a result of the export curbs, which also cast uncertainty into the global supply chain and the global economy.\n\nThe materials affected by Japan\u2019s export controls are fluorinated polyimides, photoresists and hydrogen fluoride, which are used by South Korean tech firms such as Samsung Electronics (005930.KS).\n\nJapan now requires exporters to seek permission each time they want to ship those materials, which takes up to 90 days. Previously, it only took a couple of weeks to ship, Yoo said.\n\nOnly three shipments have been approved since Tokyo took action on July 4.\n\nJapanese officials had cited \u201cinadequate management\u201d of sensitive items exported to South Korea as a reason for the export curbs.\n\nJapan\u2019s industry minister, Hiroshige Seko, said on Wednesday that the country would respond \u201cin line with WTO procedures.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe intend to thoroughly explain Japan\u2019s stance that our actions are in accordance with WTO rules,\u201d he said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cSeoul\u2019s complaint will not lead Japan to drop its tighter export curbs on the three items, but this will certainly put pressure on Japan to cautiously implement the measures,\u201d said Ahn Duk-geun, a professor at Seoul National University.\n\n60-DAY CONSULTATION\n\nAs the first step of WTO dispute settlement, South Korea will request consultations with Japan and seek the end of the export curbs. If that does not resolve the issues, South Korea will request a WTO panel ruling on the cases, the trade minister told a briefing.\n\nThe talks could take 60 days or more, a trade ministry official said.\n\nYoo also said South Korea was considering \u201call options\u201d in response to Tokyo\u2019s decision to drop Korea from the so-called white list of preferred trading partners. South Korea is taking steps to drop Japan from its own white list, a move that experts say is likely to prompt Japan to launch a complaint at the WTO.\n\nBut WTO cases can take years.\n\n\u201cThey should resolve the matter politically and diplomatically, but chances are low for such a resolution because both governments are using the dispute to their own political advantage,\u201d said Cheong In-kyo, an economics professor at Inha University.\n\nMeanwhile, the WTO Appellate Body on Tuesday broadly upheld an April 2018 panel ruling against South Korea\u2019s anti-dumping duties on imports of pneumatic valves from Japan.\n\nBut South Korean trade officials said the decision is not a victory for Japan, arguing that the WTO rejected most of Japan\u2019s claims, making it unlikely Seoul will need to scrap anti-dumping duties on Japanese valves.", "description": "South Korea plans to file a complaint over Japan's tighter export controls at the World Trade Organization on Wednesday, accusing Tokyo of being \"politically motivated\" and \"discriminatory\" in an escalating row rooted in wartime history.", "authors": ["Hyunjoo Jin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428536700&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A03T", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
