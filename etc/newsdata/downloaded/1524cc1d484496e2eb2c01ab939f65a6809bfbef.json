'The failure occurred at this moment.\n\n'There was nothing in his personnel file that indicated he might be radicalised... If there had been a sign, maybe we could have avoided this,' he said.\n\nInvestigators further revealed that Harpon had in fact been in contact with adherents of Salafism, the ultra-conservative branch of Sunni Islam.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nFrench interior minister Christophe Castaner conceded, 'Obviously, there were failings' in an interview on Sunday (pictured: outside police headquarters on Thursday)\n\nHe had defended 'atrocities committed in the name of that religion,' anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said Saturday.\n\nBut even though a police official charged with investigating suspected radicalisation among the force questioned the colleagues, none of them wanted to file an official complaint.\n\nCastaner will face questioning by parliament's intelligence commission Tuesday over the attack, its president Christian Cambon said Sunday.\n\n'We're going to try to find out what these failings were,' Cambon told AFP.\n\nTwo emergency service members attend the corpse of Harpon outside the famed police headquarters in the centre of Paris\n\nRicard, the prosecutor, also revealed Saturday that Harpon had begun wearing traditional Islamic garments for mosque visits, and had started refusing 'certain kinds of contact with women'.\n\nIt also emerged that Harpon's personal life had been subject to an extensive background check early in his career, since he worked with classified information as part of the Paris police's intelligence division.\n\nAnd while he did not have a criminal record, he was given an official sanction in 2012 over a case of domestic violence three years earlier.\n\nHarpon's 38-year-old wife was taken into custody Thursday after officials found they had exchanged 33 text messages shortly before the attack, ending the conversation with 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is greatest').\n\nA police source said she was released without charge on Sunday evening.\n\nHarpon was shot dead after killing four people with a 13 inch kitchen knife and an oyster knife during the lunchtime attack.\n\nThe assailant was born on the French overseas territory of Martinique in the Caribbean.\n\nSources said he had worked in a section of the police service dedicated to collecting information on jihadist radicalisation.\n\nSeveral people interviewed by police have since revealed he converted to Islam in 2008, not 18 months ago as had been suggested, according to BFMTV.\n\nHarpon also had links with a hate preacher in the Val-d'Oise who is known to French intelligence agencies, investigators found after searching his phone.\n\nThe victims have been identified as General Damien E., 50, Brice L., 38, Anthony L., also 38, and Aurelia T., 39.\n\nMen in balaclavas walk outside the building in Gonesse where Harpon lived after the knife attack on Thursday which killed four\n\nThe attack took place at the Paris police headquarters in the historic centre of the city, near the fire-ravaged Notre Dame cathedral\n\nMilitary personnel block the bridge near Paris Police headquarters after the knife rampage\n\nFrench police have often been targets of jihadist groups such as the Islamic State since 2015, from large, synchronised assaults to isolated knife and gun attacks.\n\nIn June, a parliamentary report on radicalisation within the public services spoke of 30 suspected cases out of the 150,000 police officers and 130,000 gendarmes in France.\n\nLaurent Nunez, France's deputy interior minister, said Sunday that while Harpon did not appear to be linked to an Islamic cell, investigators were still not sure what confidential information, if any, he might have passed on.\n\n'We don't know what information he had access to,' Nunez told BFM television.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is to lead a tribute to the victims on Tuesday.", "description": "Mickael Harpon, 45, left headquarters on Thursday only to return with an oyster knife and a 13-inch kitchen knife to slit the throat of at least one of his colleagues, before he was shot through the head.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/08/19384500-0-image-a-17_1570434756662.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
