He felt a \u201cdeep sense of remorse\u201d at helping bring the man who would become president gain wider attention. Andrew O\u2019Hagan famously detailed the extraordinary details of ghosting Julian Assange\u2019s memoir, including watching the WikiLeaks founder eat jam pudding with his hands, before the latter backed out of a \u00a3600,000 book deal. This week, the writer Natalie Beach joined the grand tradition of ghostwriters speaking out about their subjects, with a deeply intimate essay in the Cut laying out how she used to ghost everything for her former friend and controversial \u201cinfluencer\u201d Caroline Calloway: from Instagram captions to the aborted book that once attracted a $375,000 (\u00a3300,000) publishing deal, until their relationship broke down irretrievably.\n\nBeach\u2019s account says that after the pair put the book proposal together, the influencer felt unable to write it. Beach says she \u201cbought us time with the publishers by writing a quarter of the manuscript by myself\u201d.\n\nWith Calloway now obsessively responding on Instagram to Beach\u2019s essay, and as the internet picks over the details of the story \u2013 you can find out if you\u2019re more of a Caroline or a Natalie in the inevitable Buzzfeed quiz \u2013 the bestselling ghostwriter Andrew Crofts ponders if it had all been planned.\n\n\u201cIs it a car crash, or have they achieved exactly what they want to achieve?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s all very Tom Ripley/Dickie Greenleaf. That\u2019s what\u2019s intriguing.\u201d\n\nAs a ghostwriter himself, Crofts questions the ethics of speaking out about his subjects\u2019 lives. \u201cI do think Tony Schwartz shouldn\u2019t have come out and said anything about Trump, because you\u2019ve taken the money. It\u2019s like a lawyer: if you find that the person you\u2019re representing is a murderer you can\u2019t then go around bewailing the fact you defended them \u2013 that was your job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think he made Trump, I don\u2019t think Trump would be president if he hadn\u2019t written that book for him, because he\u2019d never have got The Apprentice without the book, and the presidency without The Apprentice. So it must be weighing heavily on his conscience.\u201d\n\nGhostwriters must be good at several things \u2013 being amenable to being steered by a subject, while also being firm enough to guide them away from tangents and uninteresting details. But the most important thing in ghostwriting, says Crofts, is absence of ego. \u201cWhich is maybe what went wrong [with Calloway] \u2013 Natalie isn\u2019t a born ghost, she\u2019s a writer herself. She was really young and well out of her depth, completely swamped by this girl\u2019s flamboyance,\u201d he says. \u201cGhostwriters do attract a lot of fantasists and people who have ideas way above the likelihood of success. They always think their story is fantastically interesting and going to be a bestseller. You\u2019re always dealing with people with larger-than-life egos, so there\u2019s always a danger you\u2019re going to run up against someone who is impossible to manage.\u201d\n\nWith more than 80 books behind him, a dozen of which were No 1 bestsellers, Crofts can only recall having to sever ties with one subject himself. \u201cHe was an elderly gentleman, and I remember him coming out of the shower naked,\u201d he says. \u201cHe had all the photographs for the book spread out on the floor and they were sticking to his feet, and I thought: \u2018It\u2019s time to go.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Natalie Beach\u2019s tell-all about the controversial influencer wasn\u2019t the first case of a ghost exposing their subject, following Julian Assange and Donald Trump", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e2b365b36cde4066ef8ba532ade1b1f83ada445/387_183_2137_1281/master/2137.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b391c8409d81b8e1bf790ab71426af6a", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
