Gerrard's still got game\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLeading from the front and lively in possession, Gerrard controlled the tempo from the first whistle.\n\nHis vision to pick out a pass, even with his playing days behind him, is still second-to-none.\n\nThe current 'Gers boss put on a masterclass for the fans, playing a key role in Liverpool's first three goals - all while being playfully booed by the home support.\n\n2. And Heskey too!\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nEmile Heskey was a criminally underrated footballer - and it appears he's still got it too.\n\nYou don't collect 62 England caps and 223 appearances for Liverpool by accident - despite what the Sport Bible generation will tell you.\n\nHis goal in the first half here was lovely - sitting the goalkeeper down and lifting the ball over him to nestle in the back of the net.\n\nYes he's packed on a bit of timber, but that touch is as silky as ever at the mere age of 41.\n\n3. Adam back in blue\n\nDo you remember the 88 appearances and 18 goals that Charlie Adam managed in a Rangers shirt over a decade ago?\n\nNo? Us neither!\n\n4. Bad Boyd\n\nKris Boyd scored 138 goals in 237 games for Rangers during his time at Ibrox.\n\nHe enjoyed a goal-laden career north of the border, also scoring frequently with Kilmarnock during three separate spells.\n\nBut the 36 year-old got his showing here off to the worst possible start - with a dismal penalty.\n\nHe converted 36 times from the spot in his playing days. This may well have been his worst effort ever, dragging a bobbler wide.\n\n5. Luis Garcia - the old Roberto Firmino\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe hair is shorter and features more flecks of gray. The feet may not dance as quick a they used to.\n\nBut the man whose 'ghost goal' settled the tightest of Champions League semi-finals in 2005 and became a cult figure at Anfield has still got game.\n\nThe impish Spaniard nudged home the opener, bravely meeting a cross with a diving header on the six-yard line, still showing that sharp movement that was a feature during his pomp.\n\nThroughout he floated in the half spaces, dropping into positions defenders don't want to go and linking play.\n\nIt was all enough to make you think that, if he were in his prime now, he'd be the ideal squad member to act as back up current Kop No.9, Roberto Firmino.", "description": "Steven Gerrard played for both sides at Ibrox but it was the Reds who ran out victorious in Glasgow", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Adam Payne", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566620.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rangers-Legends-v-Liverpool-Legends-Legends-Match-Ibrox-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
