Sister publications of the Cape Times also ran with the story.\n\n\n\nDasnois complained that the newspaper\u2019s coverage of the outcome of her case against Independent Newspapers following her dismissal, as heard in the Labour Court, was unfair.\n\nShe was dismissed as editor in 2014 after the death of former President Nelson Mandela.\n\nIndependent chairperson Iqbal Surve cited her failure to lead with Mandela's death on the front page as one of the reasons for her dismissal. At the time, the newspaper had, instead, carried the news of Mandela's death in a special wraparound.\n\nIndependent Newspapers and Dasnois eventually settled out of court, where the media house withdrew all allegations of racism against her as part of the settlement.\n\nThe newspaper then ran the article that it had been \"vindicated\" the following day.\n\nAccording to Dasnois she was publicly and falsely labelled as a racist and as an immoral person who at the time of Mandela\u2019s death had disrespected him and those who mourned him.\n\nShe took the matter to the press ombudsman.\n\n\n\nThe press ombudsman ruled that the headline the Cape Times used in its report on the settlement was \"problematic\" and that it was in breach of the Code of Ethics and Conduct. The article included Surve's take on the matter.\n\n\n\nThe press ombudsman found that the while the story mentioned the newspaper's \"'vindication' as opinion...the headline presented it as fact\".\n\n\u201cThis means that 'many readers would reasonably' have concluded that Independent Newspapers has in fact 'won' the case and that Dasnois has 'lost' it,\u201d the press ombudsman ruled.\n\n\n\nOther Independent titles, The Diamond Fields Advertiser and The Star were also directed to apologise to Dasnois \u201cfor omitting to state that the agreement entailed that Independent Newspapers withdrew all allegations of racism against Dasnois, that she never intended to show disrespect for Mandela, and that her editorial independence was not in dispute...\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Cape Times has to issue a front page apology to the newspaper\u2019s former editor, Alide Dasnois, following a newspaper headline published on 10 May 2016 the press ombudsman has ruled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2625/ccc270a7816443cd814b8fbbfa920c3a.jpg", "published_at": "2016-08-01"}
