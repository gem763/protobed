In a function that was held at the government school in Bhind on October 18, the school principal got garlands in a plastic bag, to welcome the guests. That is when the DC fined him Rs 1,000.\n\nDistrict Collector, Chhote Singh, was the Chief Guest at the function on biodiversity, organised in collaboration with the forest department where students of around 57 schools were participating. In an embarrassing moment for the school, as soon as Singh noticed the principal using single-use plastic, he fined him on the spot and gave him a receipt of the same.\n\nThe guests and students were shocked at that moment, but the sole reason to do this was to send a strong message to the public to stop using single-use plastic.\n\nRepresentational Image - AFP\n\n\u201cThe garlands to welcome guests were brought in single-use polythene bags and the water was being served in single-use plastic bottles. It was unfortunate that these items were used where hundreds of students were present and the programme was aimed at creating awareness about the environment. Use of such things sends the wrong message.\"\n\nDon't Miss 14.2 K SHARES 493 SHARES 1.1 K SHARES 1.2 K SHARES\n\n\"The incident happened before the commencement of quiz on biodiversity, so I announced from the stage about the fine which was to be collected on the spot and a receipt was given. The aim was to send a message, especially among students, and not meant to embarrass anyone,\u201d Singh told the Times Of India.\n\nIn his speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that use of single-use plastic will be banned in India which was supposed to come into effect from October 2, 2019. While that has not happened, a lot of individuals as well as organisations are looking for ways to completely do away with single-use plastic.\n\nThe example set by the DC will go a long way in driving home the message, especially for students who are supposed to be extremely impressionable.", "description": "To send across a stern message to stop the use of single-use plastic, the District Collector of Bhind fined a school principal.
