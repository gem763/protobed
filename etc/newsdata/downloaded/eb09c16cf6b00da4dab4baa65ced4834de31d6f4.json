It makes you wonder how many times they do get away with it,' Mr Cochrane said.\n\nMr Cochrane described the parking ticket system as 'prehistoric and chaotic'.\n\nAfter showing evidence of his innocence Mr Cochrane said Wilson Parking waived his fine but he said it was disappointing it took to long for them to accept their error.", "description": "Dyllan Cochrane, 31, parked his car outside the Mt Wellington City Fitness gym in Auckland, New Zealand on October 12.", "authors": ["Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/00/20354760-0-image-a-14_1572396541930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
