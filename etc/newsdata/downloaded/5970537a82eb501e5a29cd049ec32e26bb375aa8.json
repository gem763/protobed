A lot of very strong female actors have a very strong male side to them.\n\nMirren, who recently took to the catwalk at Paris Fashion Week, continued to explain that she believes she herself has what many people might consider \u201cmale qualities\u201d.\n\n\u201cI hate talking about my feelings, I never want to go to the doctor and I'm a brilliant map-reader,\u201d Mirren added.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of what people might call male qualities. But I certainly look like a woman.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar-winner revealed she was 13-years-old when she first noticed the inequality between men and women before explaining that, while she has enjoyed all her previous relationships with men, she feels that men are largely responsible for the \u201cdestruction caused in the world\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cBut then women are very often very complicit in that, so I'm not letting them off the hook, either.\u201d\n\nMirren\u2019s latest on-screen endeavour sees her star in lavish Sky original period drama Catherine The Great as the 18th century Russian monarch.\n\nSpeaking at the premier of the show, Mirren admitted she struggled to understand the character\u2019s \u201csexual liberation\u201d despite her own forward-thinking.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018You just have to think like a man because men don\u2019t have any problem with this\u2019,\u201d Mirren said.\n\n\u201cSo obviously it can be human quality if you like, just think like a bloke.\u201d", "description": "Dame Helen Mirren has said she does not believe there is such a thing as \u201cbinary sexuality\u201d.
