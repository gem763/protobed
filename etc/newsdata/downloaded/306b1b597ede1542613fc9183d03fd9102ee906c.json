The implication is that Biden was engaging in some shady, secretive dealing.\n\nIn fact, Biden has spoken publicly about how, acting on behalf of the Obama administration, he threatened to withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government didn\u2019t dismiss Shokin. The U.S. was one of many countries urging Shokin\u2019s ouster on the grounds that he wasn\u2019t energetically pursuing corruption cases. There is no evidence that Biden was acting out of personal interest, and his son\u2019s past position has long been a matter of public record.\n\nThe remainder of the ad maligns CNN\u2019s prime-time anchors Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon as journalists who are willing to \u201cfall in line\u201d with Democrats\u2019 pursuit of an impeachment inquiry over Trump\u2019s documented requests for Ukrainian assistance with a probe of the Bidens.\n\nAddressing that ad, a CNN spokesperson told HuffPost that \u201cit does not meet our advertising standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecifically, in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe second Trump campaign ad, titled \u201cCoup\u201d and posted to YouTube on Wednesday, accuses Democrats of \u201ctrying to undo the election regardless of facts, attacking the president by any means necessary\u201d and \u201cfabricating evidence.\u201d It describes the impeachment inquiry as \u201cnothing short of a coup\u201d that \u201cmust be stopped.\u201d\n\nCNN told HuffPost that while it \u201caccepts political and advocacy advertising across the political spectrum,\u201d advertisers are required to \u201csubstantiate all factual claims made in their ads.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot accept this ad as it contains statements of fact that are not true,\u201d the company said. \u201cSpecifically, the ad contains assertions of fact about the whistleblower complaint that have been refuted by the Intelligence Inspector General. In addition, it is inaccurate to use the word \u2018coup\u2019 to describe a constitutionally prescribed legal process.\u201d\n\nCNN said it has also received a third ad from the Trump campaign called \u201cChanging Things\u201d and that ad can be aired \u201cas it meets our commercial clearance standards.\u201d\n\nThat spot, which was posted to YouTube on Thursday, appears less incendiary, focusing partly on job creation, trade and border security.", "description": "The ads decried impeachment as a \"coup\" and bashed the network's anchors as \"media lapdogs.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d97668d210000330030b7d7.jpeg?cache=a4abkmjhdg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
