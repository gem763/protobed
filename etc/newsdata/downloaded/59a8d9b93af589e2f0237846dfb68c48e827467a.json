Artillery guns fired a salute.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping, wearing a gray Mao jacket, and other Chinese leaders, including former Presidents Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, watched from atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace at the square\u2019s north end.\n\n\u201cNo force can shake the status of our great motherland, and no force can stop the progress of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation,\u201d Xi said in a nationally televised speech.\n\nXi rode in an open-topped limousine past dozens of rows of truck-mounted missiles, armored personnel carriers and other military gear. Soldiers in helmets and combat gear shouted, \u201cHello, leader!\u201d and \u201cServe the people!\u201d Xi replied, \u201cHello, comrades.\u201d\n\nThe event marks the anniversary of the Oct. 1, 1949, announcement of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China by then-leader Mao Zedong following a civil war.\n\nThe parade follows Xi\u2019s promise in a speech Monday to allow Hong Kong to manage its own affairs despite anti-government protests that have embarrassed the ruling party ahead of the year\u2019s highest-profile propaganda event.\n\nThe parade through central Beijing is due to include 15,000 troops and more than 160 aircraft.\n\nChinese news reports say it might include a new long-range nuclear-armed missile and a supersonic drone aircraft.
