(Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping have plenty of reasons to call off their trade war.\n\nBoth face weakening economies that would likely further deteriorate if their conflict escalates.\n\nBoth are up against a formidable adversary that shows no inclination to yield.\n\nBoth are tangled in political turmoil \u2013 Trump with impeachment proceedings, Xi with angry protests in Hong Kong.\n\nBoth, in short, would welcome some good news.\n\nYet the 13th round of U.S.-China trade negotiations, set to begin Thursday in Washington, is unlikely to prove any more successful than the previous 12 in resolving tensions that have rattled markets, threatened global growth and paralyzed business investment in the United States.\n\nIn this May 10, 2019, file photo, China's Vice Premier Liu He, left is greeted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, second from right, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, third right, as he arrives at the Office of the United States Trade Representative in Washington. China's Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday that Liu is going to Washington on Thursday for talks aimed at ending the tariff war. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nStocks skidded Tuesday: US raises tensions ahead of China talks; Dow, S&P 500 dipped lower\n\nThe issues that divide the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 mainly over allegations that Beijing deploys illicit tactics in a drive to acquire and develop cutting-edge technology \u2013 are likely too daunting to produce the kind of \u201cbig deal\u201d that Trump says he wants.\n\nAt least anytime soon.\n\nThe already slim prospects for success grew dimmer Monday when the U.S. Commerce Department blacklisted a group of Chinese tech companies. The Trump administration charges that facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology developed by those companies is being used to repress China\u2019s Muslim minority. Beijing demanded that Commerce reverse the move.\n\n\u201cWe urge the United States to immediately correct its wrong practices, withdraw the relevant decisions and stop interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry warned in a separate statement that Beijing will \u201ctake all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard Chinese interests\u201d but gave no details of possible retaliation.\n\nThe U.S. stock market tumbled Tuesday \u2013 the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 314 points, or 1.2% \u2013 partly on diminishing hopes for an end to the trade war.\n\n\u201cGiven the current level of hostility (and) distrust between the two sides, the possibility of negotiating a durable and broad deal seems quite remote,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist who formerly led the China division at the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBe prepared: These popular tax breaks might be gone for good\n\n'Our president is prepared to make a deal'\n\nThe Trump administration last year accused China of using predatory tactics in its drive to develop global competitors in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and electric cars. The administration alleges, and many China analysts agree, that these tactics include stealing sensitive technology and forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets.\n\nTrump has imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese goods and plans to tax an additional $160 billion of imports on Dec. 15. This would extend U.S. tariffs to just about everything China ships to the United States.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has made very clear to China what sort of changes they need to make,\u201d said Stephen Vaughn, a partner at the King & Spalding law firm and former general counsel at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Trump. \u201cOur president is prepared to make a deal. But it\u2019s got to be a deal that makes sense to us.\u201d\n\nInstead of yielding, China so far has counterpunched by taxing $120 billion in U.S. exports, notably soybeans and other farm goods that are critically important to Trump supporters in rural America.\n\nSocial media privacy: Twitter 'inadvertently' used people's phone numbers, email addresses for ads\n\nBoth sides feeling the effects\n\nAs the trade war has dragged on for 15 months, economic damage has been inflicted on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nThe Chinese economy this year is expected to register its slowest growth since 1990.\n\nIn the United States, already struggling manufacturers are suffering from the higher costs that Trump\u2019s tariffs have imposed on components from China and are paralyzed by uncertainty over whether, when and how the trade hostilities might end.\n\nA private survey last week found that U.S. manufacturing output fell for a second straight month in September, reaching its lowest level since the recession year 2009.\n\nLarry Kudlow, the White House\u2019s top economic adviser, sounded an optimistic note as trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin prepared for two days of meetings with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He.\n\n\u201cRecently, some of the statements coming out of Beijing have been a little more positive,\u201d Kudlow said on the Fox News Channel. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in the market buying some agriculture commodities from the U.S. \u2013 soybeans, pork, and wheat and other things. That\u2019s a good sign. The mood music \u2013 the psychology \u2013 seems to be a little better, so let\u2019s see what they come up with.\u201d\n\nBut analysts say Beijing is balking at the kind of meaningful policy reforms that might satisfy the administration. Doing so would mean scaling back its bold aspirations to become a technological superpower. It\u2019s an ambition that China\u2019s leadership regards as crucial to ensuring prosperity.\n\n\u201cThere appears to be a fundamental disconnect in the stated goal of the two sides, with China looking for a mini deal and the Trump team talking about settling for only a comprehensive deal,\u201d Prasad said.\n\nUS cities with the lowest poverty rates: California home to the most\n\nThe administration did forge a mini trade deal of sorts on Monday, when it signed an agreement with Japan that gives American farmers greater access to the Japanese market. But that deal delayed thornier issues, such as trade in autos, for a more comprehensive pact in the future.\n\nA limited deal with Beijing might involve the United States delaying new tariffs in exchange for China buying more U.S. farm products.\n\nDavid Herring, president of the National Pork Producers Council, said hog farmers hope to see China reduce its retaliatory tariffs of 62% on American pork. China is facing a major pork shortage as it combats African swine fever.\n\n\u201cChina really needs pork,\u201d Herring said. \u201cSo we\u2019re optimistic a deal will come about.\u201d\n\nWhat is a realistic resolution?\n\nThe Trump administration and Beijing have previously agreed to short-term cease-fires, delaying tariff increases to buy time for more talks. But Dennis Yang, professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business, said he has spoken with Chinese business executives who are bracing for a lengthy battle.\n\n\u201cThe business community has been prepared for more of a long-term fight,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThey have had a long time \u2013 more than a year \u2013 to prepare for the imposition\u201d of more U.S. tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe expectation for a great deal is probably gone,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIt would probably be too ambitious to achieve a deal for China to give up Made in China 2025 or its industrial policies. I think that never has been a realistic goal.\u201d\n\nContributing: Kevin Freking, Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/09/us-china-trade-war-hopes-before-trade-talks-begin-thursday/3917307002/", "description": "The 13th round of U.S.-China trade negotiations are set to begin Thursday in Washington, D.C.", "authors": ["Paul Wiseman", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
