However, reliable sci-fi plot device though they may be, no one knows if they really exist.\n\nNow, scientists at the University at Buffalo and Case Western Reserve University in the US, and Yangzhou University in China have published new research in Physical Review D to detail a way to potentially locate wormholes.\n\nAlso on rt.com More than just UFOs: Pentagon\u2019s secret program researched wormholes, invisibility & death-rays\n\nThey propose honing in on Sagittarius A*, believed to be a supermassive black hole right at the centre of our galaxy. Wormholes, in theory, require the extreme gravitation conditions of such an enormous black hole.\n\nIf a wormhole exists then the stars nearby would be affected by the gravity of stars on the other side of the wormhole\u2019s tunnel, so the researchers argue that searching for anomalies in the orbits of the stars close to Sagittarius A*.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t get your hopes up about the prospect of time travel via wormhole just yet; study co-author Dr Dejan Stojkovic says that if wormholes even exist, then they\u2019re probably not as we\u2019ve seen them on our screens.\n\n\u201cEven if a wormhole is traversable, people and spaceships most likely aren\u2019t going to be passing through,\u201d he says. \u201cRealistically, you would need a source of negative energy to keep the wormhole open, and we don\u2019t know how to do that. To create a huge wormhole that\u2019s stable, you need some magic.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Through the wormhole: Spacecraft could survive black hole shortcut across the universe \u2013 study\n\nThere\u2019s also a chance that using this methodology to locate wormholes could simply find other structures that might give rise to the same effects on nearby stars as wormholes do in theory.\n\nLike this story?
