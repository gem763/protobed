She\u2019s wrong.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi at the Capitol. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nSidney Blumenthal is the author of \" All the Powers of Earth 1856-1860 ,\" the third of his five-volume biography, \"The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln,\" and a former adviser to President Bill Clinton and to Hillary Clinton.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly invoked Abraham Lincoln to justify her refusal to support the impeachment of President Trump. \u201cPublic sentiment is everything,\u201d she has said, quoting Lincoln. Pelosi\u2019s theory of public opinion, supposedly adopting Lincoln\u2019s wisdom, is that impeachment must gain the support of the American people before she would be willing to lend it her imprimatur; only about 35 percent of the public supports that remedy, a figure that has remained fairly stable over the past year. Why risk Democratic members in marginal seats over an action that will fail in the Republican-controlled Senate? Instead, she has offered the novel notion that Trump will \u201cself-impeach.\u201d He will discredit himself, sparing Democrats the hard work as well as the risk of losing the House majority.\n\nWhatever Pelosi\u2019s speculative tactical scenario, her account of Lincoln\u2019s ideas about public opinion is badly mistaken. \u201cWith public sentiment, nothing can fail,\u201d Lincoln said. \u201cWithout it, nothing can succeed.\u201d Critically, however, Pelosi sees public opinion as something to follow. Lincoln saw it as something to shape.\n\nLincoln urgently believed that counting on dangerous demagogues to disgrace themselves was a disastrous strategy that would only permit them to further undermine democratic principles in the interests of their own power. Demagogues, Lincoln understood, feast on political passivity and drift. They could be halted, he declared, only by entering the conflict to \u201ceducate and mold public opinion.\u201d\n\nLincoln wrote the line that Pelosi cites in a note to himself on the day of the first of his famous debates with Sen. Stephen A. Douglas in 1858. He did not consider public opinion an abstract, vague or distant force that he hoped might somehow be on his side. He believed he was in a ferocious battle for public opinion against foes who were misleading it with lies and invective. Douglas, he wrote, intimidated his own party just as he tried to bully the public at large. \u201cIt is a party necessity with them to say they agree with him; and there is danger they will repeat the saying till they really come to believe it. Others dread, and shrink from his denunciations, his sarcasms, and his ingenious misrepresentations.\u201d\n\n[The U.S. has no rules for when the president is a national security threat]\n\nUnless challenged directly, the harangues of Douglas and his supporters would lead public opinion to favor slavery or, worse, be indifferent to it. Depending on the public alone to resist the harangues would conclude with a nightmare scenario: \u201cAnd then, the negro being doomed, and damned, and forgotten, to everlasting bondage, is the white man quite certain that the tyrant demon will not turn upon him too?\u201d\n\nLincoln remained consistent on the need to call out the traducers and the folly of waiting for their self-destruction. In 1859, he warned against \u201cthe miners and sappers\u201d of public opinion, \u201cthis gradual and steady debauching of public opinion,\u201d seeking to extend slavery. \u201cI ask attention to the fact that in a pre-eminent degree these popular sovereigns are at this work; blowing out the moral lights around us; teaching that the negro is no longer a man but a brute; that the Declaration has nothing to do with him.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s theory, by contrast, has been that the way to save her majority is to forestall impeachment through delay, to hold back the overwhelming numbers that would give it momentum and to let Trump engage in \u201cself-impeachment.\u201d The \u201cstruggle\u201d Lincoln described is avoided.\n\n[Impeachment isn\u2019t optional. If facts point in that direction, Congress must act.]\n\nIt is a theory of studied passivity.\n\nDuring the months that Pelosi has been misconstruing Lincoln\u2019s line, Trump\u2019s grandiose sense of impunity has inflated and his recklessness increased. After special counsel Robert S. Mueller III released his report on the investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and the Democrats flailed in holding the president to account for obstructing that investigation, Trump concluded he could continue to operate unrestricted by law. Perhaps he felt liberated to try to coerce the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, into undermining the presidential candidacy of former vice president Joe Biden by enlisting Zelensky in a smear campaign.\n\nThe exposure of Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference in a presidential election (\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening\u201d) now presents Pelosi with a quandary about her theory of impeachment \u2014 and, incidentally, her bowdlerized version of Lincoln. The Great Emancipator dismissed the prestigious Gen. George McClellan with the remark, \u201cHe has got the slows.\u201d He promoted Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and protected him from his critics with the comment, \u201cI can\u2019t spare this man. He fights!\u201d The slows, Lincoln knew, would never move \u201cpublic sentiment.\u201d Pelosi up to now has summoned the spirit of the nearly disastrous and reactive passivity of McClellan and suppressed her inner Grant.", "description": "He said \u2018public sentiment is everything.\u2019 But he didn\u2019t wait for it.
