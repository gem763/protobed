REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will implement its September stimulus package in full and it is now time to turn the page after weeks of open disagreement about the measures, French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ECB cut rates deeper into negative territory last month and agreed to restart bond purchases, a divisive move that was opposed by more than a third of the rate-setting Governing Council, an unusually high level of dissent for a normally collegial body.\n\n\u201cHave no doubt: We are committed, and the whole package will be implemented,\u201d Villeroy, who also opposed the asset purchases, told a university lecture. \u201cIt is time to turn the page, and turn to the future.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage ECB needs to clarify symmetric nature of inflation target - Villeroy\n\nSeveral Governing Council members, including the central bank chiefs of Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, openly criticised the decision in recent weeks, stirring an unusual debate and raising some doubts in markets about the ECB\u2019s determination.\n\n\u201cWe have to maintain an accommodative monetary policy in the face of the economic slowdown and low inflation,\u201d Villeroy added.\n\nWith ECB chief Mario Draghi leaving office at the end of the month, incoming ECB President Christine Lagarde already promised a review of the bank\u2019s policy framework, and Villeroy said that such a move would be \u201cvery welcome.\u201d", "description": "The European Central Bank will implement its September stimulus package in full and it is now time to turn the page after weeks of open disagreement about the measures, French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441625413&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1YE", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
