In fact, it\u2019s been a long and complex one.\n\nThe past few years have not been easy for Kanye, 42, who has battled with his mental health thus putting the breaks on his music career. But it appears that after some time out of the spotlight, the rapper may have found his saving grace and it is religion.\n\nOver the past year, Kanye\u2019s hosted his Sunday Service every week almost without fail. While it initially seemed like a gimmick to propel his fledgling music career, it\u2019s clearly part of a personal journey for \u2018Ye.\n\nAddressing a crowd at George Washington University\u2019s Lisner Auditorium, Kanye said last week: \u2018I want to let you know that I am not here for your entertainment this afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We are here to spread the gospel.\n\n\u2018Excuse me if I mispronounce anything. I am a recent convert. It means I recently got saved within the year.\u2019\n\nAs Kanye finds the light in his darkness, let\u2019s take a look back at where his relationship with religion began.\n\nKanye\u2019s Sunday Service is both a personal and musical experience (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nCollege Dropout\n\nKanye\u2019s late mother, Donda West, was known to have been a proud religious woman so it\u2019s no surprise that God was frequently mentioned on Kanye\u2019s debut album The College Dropout.\n\nMost notably, Jesus Walks pretty much introduced us to Kanye\u2019s faith.\n\nOn the track, Kanye recalls how he was advised at the beginning of his career not to rap about religion in order to be a chart success \u2013 something which he clearly ignored.\n\n\u2018So here go my single, dog, radio needs this / They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus / That means guns, sex, lies, videotape / But if I talk about God my record won\u2019t get played, huh?\u2019 he raps.\n\nAs well as brief mentions about God on Family Business and Touch The Sky, we first began to see Kanye\u2019s battle between religion and the trappings of fame on Can\u2019t Tell Me Nothing in 2007.\n\n\u2018I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven, when I awoke, I spent that on a necklace/ I told God I\u2019d be back in a second, man it\u2019s so hard not to act reckless,\u2019 he raps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI Am A God\n\nBy the time 2013 rocked around, Kanye had come out the other side of that battle and was now professing himself to be a god.\n\nThere was seemingly no turning back as he stated on I Am A God: \u2018I just talked to Jesus, He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up Yeezus\u201d. I said, \u201cS**t, I\u2019m chilling, trying to stack these millions\u201d/ I know he the most high, but I am a close high.\u2019\n\nAlthough, he did close the track with: \u2018Ain\u2019t no way I\u2019m giving up on my God,\u2019 suggesting he did still recognise God in the biblical sense.\n\nAround that time, Kanye clarified his religious beliefs in a chat show interview with his mother-in-law Kris Jenner: \u2018I\u2019m a Christian, it\u2019s important to me that I grow and walk and raise my family with Christian values.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSunday Service\n\nStill, Kanye was really taking his own god complex all the way and actually first introduced us to the idea of him leading Sunday Service on the track New God Flow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us,\u2019 he said in a pretty apt foreshadowing of his future calling.\n\nOn several occasions during the Yeezus era, Kanye compared himself to God on songs like Chief Keef\u2019s Don\u2019t Like, where he spits: \u2018They steal your whole sound: that\u2019s a soundbite, the media crucify me like they did Christ/ They want to find me not breathin\u2019 like they found Mike.\u2019\n\nIn 2016, \u2018Ye described his seventh studio album The Life of Pablo as a \u2018gospel album with a whole lot of cursing on it.\u2019\n\nIt was later thought that Kanye wasn\u2019t as in touch with his faith as he once was as he battled personal issues.\n\nBut then Sunday Service was born and he was \u2018saved\u2019.\n\nMarriage\n\nKanye\u2019s wife Kim Kardashian has been thoroughly supportive of his new religious journey and is a regular in the front row at Sunday Service, along with their children North, six, Saint, three, and one-year-old Chicago. Little Psalm is probably still a little too young at just five months old.\n\nBut he gave Kim \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 a huge shock when he told the reality TV star that it \u2018affects\u2019 him when she dresses sexy.\n\nIn a recent episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kanye said: \u2018I went through this transition where being a rapper, looking at all these girls and looking at my wife, like, \u201cOh, my girl needs to be just like the other girls showing their body off\u201d.\n\nKim supports Kanye\u2019s religious journey but isn\u2019t on one herself (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t realise that that was affecting my soul and my spirit as someone who is married and the father of now \u2026 about to be four kids. A corset is a form of underwear. It\u2019s hot \u2014 for who, though?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim rightly pointed out that he had previously encouraged her sexy outfits up until he decided to embark on his own spiritual journey.\n\nBut he doubled down and said: \u2018You are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.\u2019\n\nFans are now awaiting the release of Kanye\u2019s elusive ninth album, Jesus Is King, which is expected to take a gospel direction in keeping with the music at his Sunday Service. But in typical Kanye fashion, there\u2019s no set release date and the project has been pushed back several times.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Kanye\u2019s relationship with religion has been fairly unpredictable in the past so there\u2019s no telling where it\u2019ll go in the future.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
