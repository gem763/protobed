Today, you\u2019ll hear about college administrators working from the comfort of their air-conditioned offices, using intimidation, tricks and managerial red tape to silence students.\n\nWhile the latter is a painful and accurate description of what countless college students face every day, the truth is that the consequences of higher education\u2019s fatal romance with censorship runs far deeper than left vs. right \u2014 and beyond graduation day.\n\nAn example of this is Jones County Junior College, located in the deeply conservative small town of Ellisville, Mississippi. Earlier this month, former student Mike Brown (an activist with Young Americans for Liberty\u2019s National Fight for Free Speech campaign) sued the college after being dragged into the office of the campus police chief, who told Mr. Brown that he \u201cshould have been smarter\u201d than to express his First Amendment rights without following the school\u2019s procedures.\n\nThe \u201cAssemblies Regulations\u201d section of the school\u2019s student handbook requires that students obtain \u201cadministrative approval\u201d and wait for a minimum of three days before \u201cgathering for any purpose\u201d on campus.\n\nThe act that prompted the administration to take action against Mr. Brown was that of simply gathering and talking with other students about criminal justice reform \u2014 an issue of wide-reaching importance to the world outside of academia. \u201cSome people get in trouble for smoking weed, but at Jones College, I got in trouble just for trying to talk about it,\u201d Mr. Brown said following the incident. \u201cCollege is for cultivating thought and learning and encouraging civil discourse \u2026 That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening at Jones College.\u201d\n\nWith more than a half a million Americans incarcerated for drug-related offenses and more than $47 billion being spent every year in the war on drugs, issues like this are exactly what we should be encouraging young people to talk about. The students we educate today will be the ones tackling these issues tomorrow, but stripping them of the opportunity to have these conversations only robs society of the solutions that might one day come from them.\n\nUnfortunately, abuses like this are far too common. In September 2016, at Kellogg Community College in Battle Creek, Mich., three activists were arrested by campus police and thrown in jail for handing out pocket-sized copies of the U.S. Constitutions on a public walkway. Drew Hutchinson, the school\u2019s manager of student life, justified the action against the students by asserting that he simply wanted to \u201cprotect\u201d them.\n\nSetting aside the clearly dubious line of reasoning from Mr. Hutchinson, more than enough reason remains for outrage at how these students were treated. The Constitution is the very document that guarantees the right of every American (regardless of personal background or political affiliation) to gather, speak and worship publicly and peacefully; the Founding Fathers never said a word about \u201cpermission slips,\u201d \u201cwaiting periods\u201d or \u201cfree speech zones.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, it simply isn\u2019t possible to discuss the long-term impact of censorship in higher education without addressing its influence on the political identity of America\u2019s youth. On nearly any given day, one can easily find a new outpouring of impassioned students decrying the Orwellianization of American academia.\n\nWith self-described \u201cliberal\u201d professors outnumbering their conservative colleagues by a margin of 12 to one, the idea that post-secondary education has become a mint for the mass conversion of apathetic college students into ardent leftists seems considerably less far-fetched.\n\nAccording to a Harris poll from March 2019, 73.6 percent of millennials and Generation Z want government-provided \u201cuniversal health care,\u201d 67.1 percent believe \u201cthe government should provide tuition-free college\u201d and 49.6 percent would \u201cprefer to live in a socialist country.\u201d Compare this with a 2018 study conducted at Smith College (a private women\u2019s liberal arts college in Northampton, Massachusetts) that found that 81 percent of students now believe that \u201cwords can be a form of violence,\u201d and the picture gets even gloomier for supporters of free speech.\n\nLike most tough questions, however, answers may be found in history. With regard to freedom of speech, the civil rights movement of the 1960s is no exception. On April 3, 1968, in the last speech he would ever give, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a vigorous defense of the First Amendment, declaring that \u201cthe greatness of America is the right to protest for right.\u201d\n\nBut imagine if the people of Memphis, Tennessee \u2014 and the entire world \u2014 had been kept from hearing what King had to say. Imagine if the Jim Crow racists had been able to simply silence him and the other leaders of the civil rights movement by throwing them in jail (as they did many times) or fighting to keep their ideas out of the minds of college students. Is it even possible to imagine how different the world would be today?\n\nWhile history will look upon King with gratitude, admiration and respect, the failures of higher education to uphold the First Amendment will be recognized as cowardly and misguided. Every opportunity we take from a young person to explore a new idea (or even consider an old one differently) is not only an offense against the student themselves, but an injustice to the very society that they will soon inherit.\n\nOnly by fostering a culture of open, civil discourse will we bridge the divide splitting our nation. The first step to every form of social progress is, and always will be, freedom of speech.\n\n\u2022 Cliff Maloney is the president of Young Americans for Liberty.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
