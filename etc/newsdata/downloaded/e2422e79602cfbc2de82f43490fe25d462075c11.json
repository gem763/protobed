(Photo: Scott Dudelson, Getty Images)\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and designer Melody Ehsani are married \u2013 and they have Instagram posts to prove it.\n\nThe musician and actor, 57, and the jewelry and clothing designer shared sweet thoughts about their union, which took place over the weekend, in bride and groom posts.\n\n\"My life has changed forever and I am eternally humble and grateful,\" wrote Flea, whose real name is Michael Balzary. \"The person who sees all of me and knows who I am. My wife @melodyehsani.\"\n\nIn the accompanying picture, the couple sit on a bench, holding hands and looking into the distance.\n\nEhsani offered a simple, moving tribute to her new husband: \"This weekend I got married to my best friend. Surely, my best collaboration to date ...you're my whole heart @flea333.\"\n\nEhsani's post includes another photo of the wedding couple, showing off the bride's white-and-sheer, leaf-pattern wedding dress and her new husband's lavender double-breasted suit, accented with a green bow tie and green shoes.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers, a rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983, have been touring in the U.S. and around the world this year, playing a concert in Brazil earlier this month. Flea and fellow band members Anthony Kiedis, Chad Smith and Josh Klinghoffer also performed at the Grammys in February.\n\nThe newlyweds didn't reveal their post-wedding plans, but it seems like a safe bet that they would be watching Flea's beloved Los Angeles Lakers open the NBA season against the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday night. The couple have been photographed wearing Lakers apparel.\n\nFlea, who was born in Australia, has been devoted to the Lakers since he moved to Los Angeles in 1972. In an Instagram post earlier Tuesday, he offered a loving tribute of a different sort to his favorite basketball team.\n\n\"Our city will come together with a giant purple and gold heart, love will prevail,\" he wrote. \"Go Lakers.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/22/red-hot-chili-peppers-flea-designer-melody-ehsani-get-married/4067318002/", "description": "Flea, the bassist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and jewelry and apparel designer Melody Ehsani celebrated their weekend wedding with Instagram posts.", "authors": ["Bill Keveney", "Published P.M.
