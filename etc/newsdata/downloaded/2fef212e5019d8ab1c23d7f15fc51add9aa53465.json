But what\u2019s the difference? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the final days leading up to the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton was leading in nearly every poll against her Republican opponent.\n\nBut in the early hours of Nov. 9, 2016, Donald Trump was officially elected president.\n\nThe outcome stunned many voters and pollsters alike. As a result, a new large-scale survey will be conducted ahead of the 2020 election that aims to better catch nuances that polling in the last presidential cycle missed.\n\nDemocracy Fund, a bipartisan foundation that aims to improve the Democratic process, and researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles announced Friday that they are creating a new survey, called Nationscape, which will interview more than 500,000 voters leading up to the 2020 elections. When complete, it would be one of the largest public opinion surveys ever fielded.\n\nNationscape surveys will be conducted online and interview approximately 6,250 Americans each week over the next 80 weeks Questions will focus more on issues and attitudes rather than the candidate horserace. The survey will be fielded by Lucid, a market research platform that will provide the data to Nationscape.\n\nAn interactive guide: Who is running for president in 2020?\n\nLynn Vavreck, the Marvin Hoffenberg Professor of American Politics and Public Policy at UCLA and co-creator of Nationscape, said in a statement \u201cthe project will illustrate differences across the country on the topics voters care about most, and the way voters trade-off policies when choosing among sets of issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scale of the project represents the complexity of American politics today,\u201d Vavreck continued.\n\nDemocracy Fund President Joe Goldman said in a statement that the size and scope of the survey \u201cwill help us understand how opinions differ across small geographic areas and groups of voters not possible with traditional surveys \u2014 providing a deeper understanding of the electorate in this vital election.\u201d\n\nMore: 4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like.\n\n\u201cNationscape goes beyond horse-race polls and battleground states and gets to the real issues that are driving voters and their decisions,\u201d Goldman said in the statement.\n\nThe Nationscape survey will track attitudes and priorities in voter blocs that are often missed in past election surveys, including from groups that were crucial to the outcome of the 2016 election, according to the press release.\n\nUCLA political scientist Chris Tausanovitch, co-creator of the project, said in a statement that the survey is already showcasing how voters\u2019 opinions are being affected by national events and conversations.\n\n\u201cNationscape is already showing the way people\u2019s attitudes and priorities change in response to events taking place in the country and to show how Democrats and Republicans prioritize things differently even when they agree on policies,\u201d Tausanovitch said in a statement.\n\nVoters on both sides of the aisle, as well as Trump, have been critical of 2016 polling.\n\nClinton held a small lead against Trump ahead of Election Day in 2016. Trump went on to win the Electoral College, and with it the presidency, while Clinton won the popular vote. Trump has repeatedly criticized polling that showed him trailing, at times referring to them as \u201cfake polls.\u201d However, a study from the American Association for Public Opinion Research shows that national polling was \u201cgenerally correct and accurate by historical standards.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/11/democracy-fund-ucla-plan-survey-500-000-voters-before-election-day/3930861002/", "description": "The new survey hopes to catch nuances that polling in the 2016 presidential cycle missed.", "authors": ["Rebecca Morin", "Published A.M.
