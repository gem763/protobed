Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Noah Syndergaard and Mickey Callaway aren\u2019t on the same page regarding the value of pairing Syndergaard with his preferred catcher, Tomas Nido.\n\nAnd it was made clear again Friday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSyndergaard would rather throw to Nido than the Mets\u2019 starting catcher, Wilson Ramos. There\u2019s a certain comfort level with Nido. Syndergaard also benefits from Nido\u2019s ability to better frame the low ball.\n\nThe Mets\u2019 dilemma is that to appease Syndergaard and start Nido, it would leave Ramos, the NL\u2019s hottest second-half hitter entering Friday, on the bench.\n\nCallaway often says that Syndergaard can dominate no matter the catcher.\n\n\u201cMy faith in Noah Syndergaard and who he is and what he can do probably pushes me toward Ramos,\u201d Callaway said before the Mets faced the Dodgers on Friday night. \u201cI don\u2019t think Noah has to have a catcher. I think it\u2019s about Noah Syndergaard and who he is and what he can do. I have faith he\u2019s going to do that.\u201d\n\nCallaway and the front office ultimately have the final ruling, and yet again, they opted for Ramos\u2019 bat over Syndergaard\u2019s comfort.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t work for the third straight time.\n\nSyndergaard allowed four runs in five innings in the 9-2 loss at Citi Field, and now owns a 5.20 ERA spanning 16 starts with Ramos, including an 11.78 ERA over their last three pairings. Syndergaard allowed all four runs in the fourth with Gavin Lux\u2019s three-run homer on a questionable 3-2 curveball giving the Dodgers a 4-1 lead.\n\nThe Mets (76-71) are now three games back of the second wild-card spot, and have been eliminated in the NL East race.\n\n\u201cMechanically, I felt really good as far as I was able to keep my tempo up,\u201d Syndergaard said. \u201cI thought Wilson called a really good game, I felt we were meshing out there. Just wish I could have one pitch back.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Syndergaard in the best position to succeed?\n\nThis situation regarding the use of a personal catcher can essentially be boiled down to a debate over what puts a team in the best position to succeed.\n\nSyndergaard, who some believe overthinks things, believes he\u2019s best positioned to win with Nido, and the numbers back that up.\n\nHe owns a 2.45 ERA in 10 starts with Nido this year.\n\nThere\u2019s also the comfort level and trust that Syndergaard has with Nido, which can\u2019t be quantified. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about losing strikes because of poor framing. That allows for more confidence in his sinker.\n\nThat comfort level and drastic splits are why Syndergaard met with the coaches and general manager Brodie Van Wagenen regarding the team not pairing him with Ramos last Sunday, but it did not change their minds.\n\nA strong argument could be made that having your starting pitcher at his best is what gives a team its best chance to win since the pitcher most affects a game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m under the impression when Mickey makes the lineup,\u201d Syndergaard said, \u201che\u2019s making the lineup to put the team in the best possible situation to win a ball game.\u201d\n\nThe Mets certainly understand Syndergaard\u2019s point of view. They even paired the two together nine times in an 11-game stretch to get him going.\n\nThis late in the season, the team is making it clear that they believe their best team has Ramos in the lineup, Syndergaard\u2019s comfort level be damned.\n\nThe Mets also appear to be sending Syndergaard a message about who runs the show, which is why it appears Syndergaard won\u2019t be a lifelong Met.\n\n\u201cI have faith in Noah that he\u2019s going go out there and pitch a good game no matter who\u2019s catching him,\u201d Callaway said before the game. \u201cI understand that Ramos is going to give us the best opportunity to score runs against Clayton Kershaw.\u201d\n\nSep 13, 2019; New York City, NY, USA; New York Mets starting pitcher Noah Syndergaard (34) pitches against the Los Angeles Dodgers during the first inning at Citi Field. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA questionable curveball\n\nSyndergaard and Ramos worked well for three innings Friday, but it fell apart in the fourth inning. Cody Bellinger worked a 10-pitch walk with one out, and two batters later, A.J. Pollock ripped an RBI single to even the game at 1-all.\n\nSyndergaard then battled Lux, a rookie, into a 3-2 count, and opted for a curveball, which he had only thrown four times in his previous 77 pitches.\n\nThe curveball did not dive and hung up in the zone, and Lux hit a 103-mph bullet that hit the black above the wall in center, giving the Dodgers a 4-1 lead.\n\nThe decision to use a curveball seemed odd considering Syndergaard throws it less than 10 percent of the time, according to BrooksBaseball.net, although it has been an effective pitch for him. Syndergaard did not throw another curveball.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very good (curveball),\u201d Syndergaard said.\n\nRamos did reach base twice, showing why the Mets value his bat.\n\n\u201cI thought they did fine. Seemed the rhythm was good,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cExcept for two pitches, it seemed to work out good.\n\nSyndergaard\u2019s next start is scheduled for Wednesday in Colorado \u2013 an unforgiving locale for any pitcher \u2013 and the Mets will either have to sit Ramos twice in five days or start Ramos in five straight games to pair Nido with Syndergaard.\n\nRamos\u2019 bat has helped the Mets stay in the race, but they can\u2019t afford to lose games due to poor performances from a starting pitcher.\n\nThe Syndergaard and Ramos connection just isn\u2019t working right now.\n\nA playoff spot could be decided on whether the Mets give in, even if Syndergaard said all the right things after the game.\n\n\u201cToday was a step in the right direction and that\u2019s building a strong relationship,\u201d Syndergaard said. \u201cI look forward to many more outings with him.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Noah Syndergaard allowed four runs in five innings in his first start with Wilson Ramos after questioning why Tomas Nido has not caught him lately.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EUmUy2idOpGfMdZzvkOJIA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/klfg7ervU943mjBOsNaPKw--~B/aD0yNTA1O3c9Mzc1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/3c152d10-d696-11e9-bfbe-8642c3310c8c", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
