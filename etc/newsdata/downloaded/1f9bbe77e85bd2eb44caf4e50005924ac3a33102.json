Over the course of some 200-plus pages, he spends a lot of time talking about Twitter and micro-events from the insane Trumpian news cycle. Very few \u201cregular\u201d people show up in his book\u2014he relies on the work of reporters and the statements of a few prominent evangelical Trump supporters to make a broad case about rot in the American church. While Howe sometimes seems to write from within an echo chamber, his keyboard-warrior style also yields the most compelling sections of the book, in which he reflects on the toxic culture of right-wing media.\n\nRead: On praying for the president\n\nConservatives who are so-called Never Trumpers are a rare breed to find in the wild, although you might not know it from the plush media gigs and small mountain of book deals this crowd has collected since Trump got elected. I wanted to talk with Howe because his rage is personal\u2014it\u2019s his church, his gospel, and his identity that he believes have been co-opted.\n\nOur conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nEmma Green: What bothers you so much about the wholesale evangelical support for Donald Trump?\n\nBen Howe: There is not necessarily anything inherently wrong with a transactional relationship with a president. But Trump brings a few problems. The first is the kind of support he demands, which is a loyalty even when he does something wrong. If you want to stay on his good side, you have to support what he did and even laud him for it.\n\nThe late \u201970s, with Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority\u2014the whole idea was that they were bringing something to Washington: expectations of morality and character. Now it seems like evangelicals are there to put faith around basic Republican politics.\n\nGreen: So it\u2019s the hypocrisy that bothers you?\n\nHowe: Hypocrisy irritates me, but it\u2019s not the objective of the book to have people go, \u201cThose guys are hypocrites.\u201d People know they\u2019re hypocrites. But I think people are misidentifying why they\u2019re hypocrites, and that\u2019s what I wanted to address.\n\nGreen: You grew up in this world, right?\n\nHowe: Yes.\n\nGreen: Does that add to your irritation?\n\nHowe: It is important for people to understand that I\u2019m coming from within this movement. I\u2019m not outside of it, looking in. I know what I\u2019m talking about because this has been my life.\n\nGreen: You talk a lot about the bitterness that motivates evangelicals in the realm of politics. Where does that come from?\n\nHowe: It comes from a reasonably understandable place. If people feel that their motives are impugned, if they feel they\u2019re not bad people but are being told they are\u2014being told they\u2019re racist or misogynist\u2014it can foster a mentality of victimhood.\n\nIn the minds of a lot of conservatives, the left exists to impugn their motives, and the Republican Party regularly lied to them and said they would defend them and then didn\u2019t. And that was the establishment. Trump became their hero, because he hated the establishment, and he beat up on the media, and he was fighting back against all these forces. The more he fights, the more they feel justified, like, He\u2019s our hero because we needed someone to do this for us.", "description": "The writer Ben Howe grew up in the world of conservative evangelicalism.
