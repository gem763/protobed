The letter strikes a contrast with a ruling from a federal judge earlier this month, which found that allegations that DOD employees unfairly favored Amazon Web Services for its Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud computing program were meritless.", "description": "The lawmakers argue that awarding the contract would be \"premature\" given the Pentagon is still probing potential conflicts of interest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/JxLe5ky38pLUVvZWZeugAaDsVKI=/0x82:5568x3214/1920x1080/2019/07/25/1564071255195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-25"}
