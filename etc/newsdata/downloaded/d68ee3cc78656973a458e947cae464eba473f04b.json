Garrett Stevens, CEO of Exchange Traded Concepts, a firm that offers services like marketing, compliance, and portfolio management to fund issuers. \u201cETFs have been around long enough that regulators realize they need their own set of rules.\u201d\n\nSince the first ETF SPY, -0.21% launched, 27 years ago, all ETFs have had to cram themselves into the framework of rules established in 1940 for mutual funds, even though they\u2019re a very different type of product. \u201cExchange-traded\u201d means that ETFs take the rough principles that define mutual funds \u2013 collectively pooled assets \u2013 and make them more accessible. ETFs can be bought and sold, and their prices updated to reflect that activity, all day long, like stocks.\n\nNow, over $3.3 trillion in assets is held in about 2,000 ETFs.\n\nRelated: More evidence that passive fund management beats active\n\nFor years, the SEC has offered ETFs a work-around called \u201cexemptive relief\u201d, but applying for such relief \u2013 in effect telling the agency why all the rules meant for mutual fund should not apply to a new ETF \u2013 often added as much as six months and tens of thousands of dollars to the launch process.\n\nSome of the more exotic ETFs will still need exemptive relief: funds-of-funds IYLD, +0.11% , leveraged funds WANT, -1.50% , or those that take an inverse approach to investing.\n\nBut analysts say the vast majority of funds that have launched in recent years would not, meaning they\u2019ll speed to market more quickly. Stevens said a new fund working with his company could expect to be trading in as little as 90 to 100 days under the new regime.\n\nRead: Do well by doing good with this fund that supports freedom and human rights\n\nThe rule also makes the ongoing management of portfolios less onerous for actively-managed funds, which currently incur tax implications when they shift their holdings. That could make it more attractive to launch an actively-managed fund, rather than one that passively tracks a index.\n\n\u201cBy treating ETFs as an investment product different from mutual funds, the SEC has taken steps to improve ETF investor education and make it easier for asset managers to run and launch products,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, in a note to clients after the rule was released.\n\n\u201cWe think small asset managers will expand their product lineups and new entrants will seek to join the ETF industry, particularly with thematic offerings.\u201d\n\nIs more necessarily better? Stevens says yes. There are far fewer ETFs than mutual funds, he pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s great for consumer choice, and this is no different than innovations in any industry. If a new fund launches and doesn\u2019t get traction, it\u2019ll go away.\u201d\n\nIt's not always so straightforward when an ETF closes, however. There are tax implications to the investor, not to mention the hassle of having to reinvest. A CFRA analysis of 1,662 funds over the five-year period 2014-2019 found that 24% of them closed, and a few dozen completely changed their original investing intention.\n\nSee: How to invest in \u2014 or avoid \u2014 what makes China China", "description": "Nearly three decades after first launching, exchange-traded funds will no longer have to apply for relief for not being mutual funds, according to a...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GB555_sec011_ZG_20180110230617.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
