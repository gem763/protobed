The new rules go into effect on September 10th.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on all of us to create a safe, constructive, and empowering environment,\u201d Tumblr writes in its blog post. \u201cOur community guidelines need to reflect the reality of the internet and social media today.\u201d The previous version of the guidelines can still be viewed on GitHub for comparison.\n\n\u201cThe internet is being exploited by hate groups.\u201d\n\nTumblr struck out words in its hate speech policy that encouraged users to argue with negative speech that \u201cdoesn\u2019t rise up to the level of violence or threats of violence\u201d and to only report something if it was \u201cespecially heinous.\u201d\n\nHere are the exact words that are now deleted, emphasis mine:\n\nIf you encounter negative speech that doesn\u2019t rise to the level of violence or threats of violence, we encourage you to dismantle negative speech through argument rather than censorship. That said, if you encounter anything especially heinous, tell us about it.\n\nThese words created a gray area, the company noted in its blog post, and content shouldn\u2019t have to reach heinous levels to merit reporting.\n\nUsers can now report hate speech directly in the mobile app through the small paper airplane icon on the bottom right-hand side of a post. Tap \u201creport\u201d and then tap \u201csomething else,\u201d which will take you to a list of more specific violations, including hate speech.\n\n\u201cThe internet is being exploited by hate groups to organize, recruit, and radicalize with horrifying efficiency,\u201d Tumblr writes in explanation for why it\u2019s updating the hate speech guideline, likely referring to alt-right groups and other radical groups online. The guidelines will also be used to remove Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, and anti-LGBTQ+ content.\n\nBanning non-consensual deepfakes\n\nThe platform is also responding to posts that glorify mass murders, like Columbine, Sandy Hook, and Parkland, which \u201ccould inspire copycat violence.\u201d The section in community guidelines that address Gore and Mutilation now also explicitly bans violent content that \u201cencourages or incites violence\u201d or glorifies the perpetrators.\n\nAnd to address the spread of revenge porn and deepfakes, where people use AI to swap people\u2019s faces into pornographic videos, Tumblr is now explicitly saying that users can\u2019t \u201cengage in the unwanted sexualization or sexual harassment of others.\u201d It\u2019s a small line that\u2019s expressly aimed at banning non-consensual images.\n\nIn addition to updating its guidelines, Tumblr also says it\u2019s increased the size of its moderation team. Posts that open up a dialogue or engage in factual, historical education about a discriminatory practice are still allowed, and the team is supposed to evaluate posts to see what kind of context they\u2019re steeped in before removing inappropriate ones.\n\nWhile other social media platforms like Discord and Twitter are still coming up with effective ways to combat hate speech and radical groups, Tumblr\u2019s approach seems straightforward enough. If users are given more specific guidelines for what constitutes bad behavior, then hate speech might no longer be able to hide within the gray areas of company policy.", "description": "Tumblr is changing its community guidelines to address hate speech, glorifying violence, and revenge porn.
