It was there, in the sun-filled house with views over South London and its own spacious garden, that she wrote her second book, a semi-autobiographical novel \u201cThe Mill on the Floss,\u201d according to English Heritage, a historical body that bestowed the blue plaque honoring Eliot on the house in 1905.\n\n\n\nEliot initially wrote under a pseudonym in part to protect her work from her somewhat scandalous private life as the partner of a married man, writer and critic George Henry Lewes.\n\n\n\nMore: Dusty Springfield\u2019s Former London Home Now Asking \u00a311.5 Million\n\nInitially, she expected to live at Holly Lodge for many years, finding the house \u201cvery comfortable, with far more of vulgar indulgences in it than I ever expected to have again,\u201d she wrote to a friend, according to a record from English Heritage.\n\n\n\nBut as her professional fame\u2014and personal notoriety\u2014grew, she found the home, among streets of snugly built row houses, a little too exposed. In her own words, Holly Lodge was overlooked by \u201chouses full of eyes\u201d and she and Lewes moved to a large detached property in Marylebone in late 1860.\n\n\n\nToday, Holly Lodge remains true to Eliot\u2019s description: \u201ca tall cake, with a garnish of holly and laurel.\u201d Built over four levels, the home has spacious interiors with vistas from a rooftop patio and a lush landscaped 75-foot-long rear garden, according to the listing with Savills.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis gorgeous period house has it all: period charm and features in abundance, light contemporary living space throughout, ample off-street parking and a wonderful garden and terrace,\u201d said property agent Alex Howard Baker.\n\n\n\nThe house, which last traded hands for \u00a31.2 million in 2006, spans roughly 3,500 square feet, including five bedrooms. The lower floors have been opened up in a modern way, including an open kitchen on the lower ground floor and a vast single reception room with two fireplaces on the next floor up.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Global UHNW Population Flatlines, Combined Wealth Declines for the First Time in Three Years\n\nThere\u2019s also a sunroom, study and two stairwells, \u201ca very unusual feature at this price range,\u201d according to the listing.\n\n\n\nMr. Baker added: \u201cThe blue plaque and its special historical context rounds it all off quite beautifully.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-111411?size=1.673202614379085&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
