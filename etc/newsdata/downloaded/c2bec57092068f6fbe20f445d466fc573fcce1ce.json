They are making a mockery of African lifestyles, and more specifically, Namibian traditional ways of living.\n\n'This home seems to have electricity, running water, wifi and all other comforts required by such outsiders - all while contrasting the Namibian's lack of access as entertainment.\n\n'It's terribly ironic that they were able to build a middle class British home in an African homestead, all amenities included. This home seems to have electricity, running water, wifi and all other comforts required by such outsiders - all while contrasting the Namibian's lack of access as entertainment.\n\n'They'd rather develop a twisted \"reality\" TV show than to invest in actual development within these communities.\n\nFinally, the spokesman said: 'This is a prime example of how white and western people are entertained by Africa's under-development and are continuously benefiting from it- from the exploitation of our resources, to mission trips, to poverty tourism.'\n\nNew show: In the Channel 4 programme, which aired on Tuesday, the former Gogglebox star, 29, lived alongside the Himba community in a Namibian tribal village\n\nSlammed: But the experiment has been branded 'twisted' and 'harmful' by activist charity, No White Saviours, hours after some angry fans said the show 'screams privilege'\n\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Scarlett Moffatt and Channel 4 for comment.\n\nThis comes after Scarlett defended the new show, and insisted that she left a water borehole in Namibia for the impoverished village.\n\nYet the new TV show has left some viewers 'uncomfortable' with angry fans even insisting it 'screams privilege' as they built a replica of Scarlett's family home with running water in the impoverished village.\n\nDefensive: This comes after Scarlett defended the new show, and insisted that she left a water borehole in Namibia for the impoverished village\n\nYet Scarlett has now hit back at critics and insisted that her family left a water borehole, which is maintained by someone, for their friends in Namibia.\n\nShe tweeted: 'Just to clarify we left a water borehole for our friends when we left Namibia which someone maintains #britishtribenextdoor \u2764\ufe0f.'\n\nAhead of the show, the reality star also hit back at negative comments, she tweeted: 'My friends were happy, empowering and beautiful souls inside and out,' followed by a heart emoji.\n\nAdding in a separate tweet: 'Let's make judgements not from a book cover yeah. I know majority of people (bar the people who are negative about everything [laughing emojis]) are going to love #thebritishtribenextdoor.'\n\nHitting back: The new TV show has left some viewers 'uncomfortable' with angry fans even insisting it 'screams privilege'\n\nThe British Tribe Next Door aired on Tuesday night and inevitably left show watchers divided as they took to social media to comment on the programme.\n\nOne person said: 'What they gonna do with the house after? Knock it down? Build them all one for being on the show? #thetribenextdoor.'\n\nA different user put: 'So, somehow, this is even worse than I imagined which is remarkable #thetribenextdoor.'\n\nAnother show watcher commented: '#thetribenextdoor Not comfortable with this at all . Turning over for #brexit news.'\n\nDivided: The British Tribe Next Door inevitably left show watchers divided as they took to social media to comment on the programme\n\nWhile a different fan added: 'We have just switched this off.

Bit worried when they built the house, was it going to be one if THOSE shows. But I'm loving learning more about the Himba tribe and seeing how life can be simpler and how frivolous we've become.'\n\nA different user put: '#thebritishtribenextdoor the people calling this show arrogant are actually the arrogant ones. Because they are clearly thinking its about showing how privileged we are to the primitive people. Actually it's about realising how ridiculous are lives are in many ways!'\n\nPraise: Yet not all show watchers were critical and other viewers praised the 'wonderful' programme for leaving them in tears\n\nAnother show watcher commented: '@ScarlettMoffatt what a wonderful wonderful programme! Ignore the idiots, the tribespeople came across as so wonderful! Your family did too! It's made me reevaluate what's really important, thank you #thebritishtribenextdoor.'\n\nWhile a different fan added: 'Just finished watching #thebritishtribenextdoor and WOW what a programme! Absolute genius TV and @ScarlettMoffatt and her family are perfect for the programme!

It's not a thing there. The most amazing thing is they all said I looked beautiful.'\n\nScarlett has said that filming the show has made a difference to how she feels about herself.\n\nConfident: Scarlett is finally feeling happy within her skin and looked lovely in a floral dress (left) after admitting in 2017 she was miserable when she was slim (pictured in 2017 - right)\n\nShe said: 'We went there in May and we're still having more meals together [as a family].\n\n'It doesn't sound like a big thing but I'm getting the tops of my arms out sometimes on show.'\n\nIn the Channel 4 programme, which airs on Tuesday, Scarlett lives alongside the Himba community in a Namibian tribal village.\n\nAnd they in turn move into her County Durham family home.\n\nKind words: Scarlett was told her body looks 'strong' and was told 'it looks like your dad's cattle are healthy' as the tribe complimented her body shape\n\nShe said: 'I've never felt so not judged and happy to be in my own skin. just feel like all my day is consumed with how I look. It's not a thing there'\n\nWhile they didn't travel to County Durham, an exact replica of the home was built in a remote corner of Africa, so the two families could live side-by-side.\n\nTwenty thousand of their possessions, from beds to scatter cushions where transported from their home to Africa.\n\nThe home looked so similar that Scarlett said: 'When I watch it, it looks crazy! That is my mam and dad's house exactly how it is.\n\n'Sometimes I would wake up of a morning and forgot I was in Namibia and see a herd of goats in the garden.\n\nPainstaking: Twenty thousand of their possessions, from beds to scatter cushions where transported from their home to Africa\n\n'It's such an amazing experience, with my family we haven't done anything all together since Gogglebox.'\n\nScarlett admitted that doing the show has made her want to focus more on her own family.\n\nShe said: 'My best friend out there asked why we have so many things. I think maybe because I'm a bit big headed I assumed they would love the house.\n\n'I don't do any cleaning, but my mam taught her best friend about the washing machine, she said you're just lazy you're letting the machines do all the work.\n\nScarlett said: 'It's such an amazing experience, with my family we haven't done anything all together since Gogglebox'\n\n'They found us very isolated and I know we would say oh we're very independent.\n\n'Candithico said to me and my little sister, 'Why do you let your nan sleep in a room on her own'?'\n\n'I think we're like the Dounty Durham Von Trapps and spend a lot of time together, and being there has made me realise we don't.'\n\nThe British Tribe Next Door is in on C4 at 9.15pm on Tuesday.", "description": "Scarlett Moffatt's controversial new show, The British Tribe Next Door,\u00a0 has been slammed by a charity for 'dehumanising'\u00a0 a Namibian tribe.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland", "Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/19/20096444-0-image-a-4_1571855132655.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
