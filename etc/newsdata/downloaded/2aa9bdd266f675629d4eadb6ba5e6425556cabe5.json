The Dallas Morning news reported that the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Malik Jackson will pay for the remainder.\n\nJefferson, 28, was shot and killed in her home by Fort Worth police officer Aaron Dean on Saturday while watching her young nephew. The shooting occurred after a concerned neighbor called the non-emergency police line to ask for a check on her welfare, because Jefferson\u2019s door was open, which he thought was unusual. Dean arrived with another officer, and walked the perimeter of the house, looking in through glass doors without announcing his presence.\n\nAccording to investigators, when he got to a back window, Dean saw someone inside the home and said \u201cPut your hands up. Show me your hands,\u201d and then immediately fired a shot.\n\nDean was arrested and charged with murder that night and has since been released on a $200,000 bond.\n\nBarnes, now with the Sacramento Kings, discussed his inspiration to contribute, and the need for change surrounding gun violence.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is, any time someone has to go through that, the last thing you want to have to worry about is trying to come up with the money for a funeral. It\u2019s about the family, going through our prayers with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a gesture that my wife and I wanted to do for them.\u201d\n\nHarrison Barnes on he and his wife\u2019s decision to pay for the funeral of Atatiana Jefferson. pic.twitter.com/D9jQSMycOR \u2014 James Ham (@James_HamNBCS) October 17, 2019\n\nBarnes has a history of giving back to the North Texas community. In 2018, Barnes, his wife and his mother put together and gave out Thanksgiving meals to dozens of South Dallas families. He also sponsored the renovation of two basketball courts at the Mesquite Boys & Girls Club, as well as hosted youth basketball camps and put on two back-to-school shopping events. He hosted additional youth events throughout his time in Dallas.\n\nLee Merritt, the attorney representing Jefferson\u2019s family, told the Dallas Morning News that the athletes \u201creached out to him about paying for the funeral and didn\u2019t want to make a big to-do about their generosity.\u201d\n\nThe wake for Jefferson is scheduled for Friday night, according to Fox 4, with funeral services scheduled for Saturday afternoon. Both will be held at Potter's House of Dallas, a megachurch with a capacity of about 8,000.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Barnes, who played for the Dallas Mavericks for two-and-a-half seasons, has a history of giving back to the North Texas community.", "authors": ["Torrey Hart", "Yahoo Sports Contributor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1s4wSMOo23s7alUkkq0M3A--~B/aD0yNzAwO3c9NDgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/5c145b40-f126-11e9-9dd7-3792a8dee15a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
