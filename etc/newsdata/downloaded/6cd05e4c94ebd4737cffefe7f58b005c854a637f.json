Yields move inversely to prices.\n\nThe move in bond markets comes after China posted its weakest growth in nearly three decades, as the U.S.-China trade war hit demand at home and abroad. The world's second-largest economy grew 6% in the third quarter, less than expected, and its weakest pace of expansion in over 27 years.\n\nThe downbeat data appeared to offset a global shift in market sentiment on Thursday, after the U.K. and European Union struck a long-awaited Brexit deal. British and EU officials reached the agreement after successive days of late-night talks and almost three years of tense discussions.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson will now attempt to persuade U.K. lawmakers to back his agreement, ahead of what is expected to be a knife-edge vote on Saturday.", "description": "U.S. government debt prices ticked lower Friday morning as investors digested Chinese data and new Brexit developments.", "authors": ["Spriha Srivastava"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104938549-GettyImages-134210415.jpg?v=1532563702", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
