Mike Parson, for example, signed a bill in May that would ban abortion at eight weeks of pregnancy with no rape or incest exceptions, though a federal judge in August blocked the law from taking effect.\n\nRepublican Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion law in May, making it a felony to perform abortions in most cases and drawing legal challenges ahead of its implementation.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a law in May banning abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected, typically around six weeks \u2014 not long, critics say, after a woman might discover she is pregnant. (Supporters of the legislation call it a \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill, a term some doctors have criticized.)\n\nA federal judge temporarily blocked that law on Tuesday from taking effect.\n\nSuch restrictions aren\u2019t just about limiting when and under what circumstances women can get abortions \u2014 these laws can also affect how much the procedure costs, research suggests. And those who are denied the procedure fare worse economically, some studies have shown.\n\nThe average cost of a surgical abortion at 10 weeks hovers at $508\n\nNine in 10 abortions are performed within the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and their cost can vary widely.\n\nThe average cost of a surgical abortion at 10 weeks was $508 in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive-health think tank that supports abortion rights, with the price tag ranging from $75 to $2,500. Early medication abortion (also known as EMA or the abortion pill) at 10 weeks cost $535 on average, with costs ranging from $75 to $1,633.\n\nWhile the reproductive-health think tank has yet to publish such data beyond 2014, its researchers haven\u2019t observed any steep rise in cost, according to Guttmacher Institute principal research scientist Rachel Jones. \u201cAfter adjusting for inflation, the cost doesn\u2019t really increase that much,\u201d Jones told MarketWatch.\n\nBut how that average cost bears out across states, providers and numerous other variables, Jones said, remains \u201ca big black box.\u201d\n\nA state\u2019s abortion-policy climate can, however, factor into how much a facility charges. For example, 34 states mandate that women receive pre-abortion counseling, and 27 states have instituted a typically 24-hour waiting period between the counseling and the procedure. Fourteen states require in-person counseling.\n\nLaws that require two visits to a clinic are associated with a $107 increase in the price of an abortion, according to a 2015 analysis of two-visit and Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers laws.\n\n\u201cRestrictive state abortion laws may impose additional expenses on the providers of abortion in order to comply with the laws,\u201d author Marshall Medoff wrote. \u201cAs a consequence, restrictive state abortion laws may increase the price of an abortion as abortion providers pass the additional costs of complying with the laws on women seeking an abortion.\u201d\n\nAbortions in the second trimester of pregnancy costs substantially more\n\nThe price doesn\u2019t always seem to track with the restrictiveness of a state\u2019s laws, according to 2017 research co-authored by Jones.\n\n\u2022 The average cost of a first-trimester surgical abortion in states with few abortion restrictions like California, New Jersey and New York was $402 after adjusting for the cost of living.\n\n\u2022 In states like Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi \u2014 which researchers described as \u201chostile\u201d to abortion because of their relatively restrictive laws \u2014 that average cost was $442.\n\n\u2022 In \u201cmiddle-ground\u201d states like Alaska and New Hampshire, it was $470. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear-cut pattern or understanding,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u2022 Prices tend to rise after the first trimester, said Jones, due in part to procedures taking more time and requiring more skill on the provider\u2019s part. Women who obtained second-trimester abortions with out-of-pocket costs paid an average of $854 versus $397, 2013 research published co-authored by Jones found.\n\nMissouri, Georgia and Alabama don\u2019t allow Medicaid to be used for abortions\n\nInsurance coverage for abortion varies. Many states have restricted coverage through private insurance or insurance-exchange plans, and several also restrict abortion coverage in public employees\u2019 health-insurance plans.\n\nThe 1977 Hyde Amendment prohibits using federal funds to pay for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a life-threatening condition, but about 16 states allow state Medicaid funds to be used for other medically necessary abortions. (Missouri, Georgia and Alabama are not among the states that extend abortion coverage to Medicaid recipients.)\n\nA majority of abortion patients pay out of pocket for the cost \u2014 even those with private insurance, Jones said.\n\nAbout 35% of abortion patients in 2014 said they had Medicaid coverage, while 31% reported having private health insurance. But more than half of patients (53%) paid out of pocket for their abortions, 24% used Medicaid, 15% used their private insurance to pay, and 14% had financial assistance. Six in 10 women with private health insurance paid out of pocket.\n\nThe anti-abortion advocacy group National Right to Life Committee says that many single mothers \u201cfind free help and support from local pregnancy care centers.\u201d The group also suggests giving the baby up for adoption as an alternative for people who can\u2019t afford to care for a baby.\n\nRepublicans say they oppose \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d Anti-abortion groups say the unborn have a right to life, believe life begins at fertilization and object to abortion on moral grounds. They comprise a range of views from those who believe abortion is wrong under any circumstance to others who believe it\u2019s acceptable in cases of rape, incest or when a woman\u2019s life is at risk.\n\nThat said, some 71% of voters oppose overturning Roe v. Wade, a July poll from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News found.\n\nNearly half of women who have abortions live below the federal poverty level\n\nResearchers also know that 75% of women who obtain abortions are low-income, with nearly half living below the federal poverty level. \u201cIt\u2019s likely a substantial expense for a lot of people \u2014 and probably enough of an expense that it prevents some women from getting abortions,\u201d Jones said.\n\nRestrictive abortion laws that require an extra trip to a clinic may introduce \u201clogistical challenges and costs\u201d that \u201cact as barriers to care for low-income women,\u201d according to the Guttmacher Institute. Having to travel long distances out of state can also increase costs, Jones added, given potential expenses related to food, overnight lodging, child care and lost wages from taking time off work.\n\nWomen who are denied abortions appear to endure far-reaching socioeconomic consequences, and this denial of services \u201cexacerbates\u201d the hardship of those already struggling to make ends meet, according to 2018 research published in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nThose who weren\u2019t able to obtain an abortion were more likely to be living in poverty four years later; they were also less likely to have a full-time job and were more reliant on public assistance than women who received abortions.\n\n\u201cThe net result may have serious adverse economic consequences for women and children,\u201d the study authors wrote. \u201cLaws that impose a gestational limit for abortion or otherwise restrict access to abortion will result in worsened economic outcomes for women.\u201d\n\nRandall K. O\u2019Bannon, the director of education and research at the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee, disputed the findings in the peer-reviewed research.\n\n\u201cThe point is that whatever \u2018economic advantage\u2019 there is to aborting, it is minimal if it exists at all,\u201d O\u2019Bannon told MarketWatch in a statement. \u201cAborting a baby doesn\u2019t lift these women out of poverty. Nothing here indicates abortion is what these women need to climb out of poverty, but pushing abortion as a solution only helps maintain the social and economic status quo.\u201d\n\nDespite the costs and concentration among low-income women, abortion is \u201cprobably the least expensive, biggest-bang-for-your buck procedure available in medicine\u201d compared to many other medical procedures, said Sara Imershein, an obstetrician and gynecologist who provides abortions in Falls Church, Va.\n\n\u201cThis is not a big money-making endeavor,\u201d said Imershein, who sits on the board of the abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation. \u201cBoth the Planned Parenthood [clinics] and the independent clinics are here to serve the women who need abortion services, not to line their pockets.\u201d", "description": "On Tuesday, a federal judge temporarily blocked lawmakers in Georgia from enacting legislation that would have made abortions in that state more restrictive.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HJ754_aborti_ZG_20190516170807.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-17"}
