President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government considers the Kurds \"terrorists\" who are allied with Turkey's outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft said Trump \"has made abundantly clear\" that the United States \"has not in any way\" endorsed Turkey's decision to mount a military incursion in northeast Syria.\n\nAs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@POTUS</a> has made abundantly clear, the U.S. has not endorsed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Turkey?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Turkey</a>\u2019s decision to mount a military incursion in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Syria?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Syria</a>. Turkey is now responsible, & failure to play by the rules, protect vulnerable populations & guarantee that ISIS does not reconstitute will have consequences. <a href=\"https://t.co/nT2ooSoI7F\">pic.twitter.com/nT2ooSoI7F</a> \u2014@USUN\n\nShe told reporters the president has emphasized to Turkey's government that it bears \"full responsibility\" for protecting Kurds and religious minorities, and for ensuring that ISIS fighters remain in prison and the extremist group doesn't reconstitute itself.\n\nCraft stressed that Turkey's \"failure to do so will have consequences.\" She didn't elaborate.\n\nThe council meeting again displayed the inability of the UN's most powerful body to deal with the more-than-eight-year Syrian conflict, which has claimed over 400,000 lives.\n\nThe statement by the European council members \u2014 United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland \u2014 who were joined by Estonia which will join the council in January, was very similar to the European Union's statement issued Wednesday.\n\n'Demographic change would be unacceptable'\n\nThe European council members' statement also urged protection of civilians and said \"it is unlikely that a so-called 'safe zone' in northeast Syria, as envisioned by Turkey, would satisfy international criteria for refugee return.\" And it stressed that \"any attempt at demographic change would be unacceptable.\"\n\nRussia's Nebenzia called the Turkish operation \"the result of demographic engineering some of the coalition partners did in the northeast of Syria.\n\n\"We warned them, [for a] long time, not to experiment with that, and not to try to count Arab tribes that lived initially in that area to be Kurdish,\" he said. \"And now in fact the Kurdish [are] reaping the fruit of their demographic policies in that part of Syria.\"\n\nTurkey is already declaring success in its military assault as it tries to flush out Kurdish militias that Ankara sees as a security threat.\n\nTurkey's defence ministry says 228 militants have been killed so far in the offensive. The Kurds said they were resisting the assault. At least 23 fighters with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and six fighters with a Turkish-backed Syrian rebel group have been killed, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war.\n\nSmoke from incoming mortar fired from the Syrian side billows in Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, in southeastern Turkey on Thursday. (Cavit Ozgul/The Associated Press)\n\nThe SDF said Turkish airstrikes and shelling have killed nine civilians.\n\nAbout 64,000 people have fled border towns in northeast Syria since artillery began to rain down in the region Wednesday, according to the International Rescue Committee. The towns of Ras al-Ayn and Darbasiya have become largely deserted.\n\nWatch as smoke rises from the Syrian border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn:", "description": "The divided UN Security Council has failed to agree on Turkey's offensive in northeast Syria, with Europeans demanding a halt to military action and Syrian ally Russia calling for \"restraint\" and \"direct dialogue\" between the two countries.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5317278.1570747933!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1180169064.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
