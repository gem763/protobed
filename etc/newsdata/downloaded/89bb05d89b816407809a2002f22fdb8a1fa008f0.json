If the average global temperature rises by 4\u00b0C by the end of the century, as it may be on track to do, scientists say a whole bunch of bad things would likely happen: higher sea levels, more extreme weather. In the US, transportation is responsible for 29% of greenhouse gas emissions, and nearly 60% of those come from light-duty vehicles like passenger cars.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Obama administration decided in 2012 to (slowly) strengthen regulations governing vehicles\u2019 tailpipe emissions and fuel economy standards, requiring each automaker\u2019s fleet to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 and boosting the penalty for missing that target. The Trump administration, on the other hand, wants to freeze those standards at 37mpg and delay the penalty hike, arguing that it will save automakers money, keeping prices low so that more people can buy newer cars with safer technology. (Electric vehicle proponents have questioned this logic.)\n\nCalifornia has other ideas. In July, state regulators said they had reached their own deal with Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen, which would continue to ramp up fuel economy standards through 2025. Together, the four automakers account for roughly 30% of US car sales. The compromise would reach the same average fuel economy levels as the Obama-era standards but with a slighter longer timeline.\n\nCalifornia is a vital market for automakers, and not just because it\u2019s the nation\u2019s largest economy: thirteen other states have pledged to follow its lead on emissions rules. Together, those 14 states account for about one-third of US vehicle sales. One set of rules for one-third of the car-buying country, and another for the rest would be disastrous for carmakers.\n\nOther big automakers are in wait-and-see mode. General Motors reportedly believes the California deal doesn\u2019t give manufacturers enough credit for investments in fully electric vehicles. The Automobile Alliance, which represents the four carmakers involved in the California deal but also non-signatories like GM and Fiat Chrysler, says its priority is avoiding \u201cuncertainty from protracted litigation.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is able to set its own emissions standards thanks to text in the Clean Air Act that dates back to the 1970s. At that time, California was well ahead of the rest of the country in combating emissions, so Congress gave it authority to write its own, stricter rules. The Bush administration tried to deny California\u2019s effort to set its own emissions standards in 2007, but Obama had taken office before the case was resolved.\n\nNow the Trump administration wants to revoke California\u2019s legal authority to set its own rules, and it\u2019s trying to do that through lawsuits and new regulations. (Technically, California and other states sued it, arguing that it doesn\u2019t have the authority to nix the Obama-era rules.) Legal experts say the administration may have a tough road ahead without Congress\u2019 help. \u201cThe statute is very clear: It says EPA shall grant the waiver,\" Cara Horowitz, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA School of Law, has told WIRED. However, federal judges at a hearing in Washington, DC, earlier this month signaled they would be willing to consider the merits of the administration's arguments.\n\nExperts say the antitrust probe into California\u2019s dealings is unusual and that antitrust charges might not apply to businesses\u2019 cooperative agreements with government entities\u2014the state of California, for example. Congress could also choose to intercede to prevent the federal government from using antitrust laws as punitive sticks.\n\nCongress, meanwhile, may launch an investigation into the antitrust probe. In a Friday letter to the head of the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, Senate Judiciary Committee member (and presidential candidate) Kamala Harris (D-California) urged the office to examine the motivations for the probe, calling it part of a \u201cmulti-pronged assault on California\u2019s framework.\u201d The House\u2019s Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, which is controlled by Democrats, has said that it will seek documents and hearings connected to the antitrust investigation.\n\nCalifornia politicians also seem ready for a long-haul flight. \u201cThe Trump administration has been attempting and failing to bully car companies for months now,\" California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement earlier this month. \"We remain undeterred. California stands up to bullies and will keep fighting for stronger clean car protections that protect the health and safety of our children and families.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared on wired.com.", "description": "Some in Congress want to investigate the Justice Department's investigators.", "authors": ["Aarian Marshall"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/GettyImages-94586420-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
