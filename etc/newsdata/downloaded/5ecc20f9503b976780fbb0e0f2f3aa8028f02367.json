The legal dispute over whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to prorogue - suspend - Parliament for five weeks continues in the Supreme Court today.\n\nFrom 10:30 BST judges will hear two-and-a-half hours of argument from the UK government. Then, after lunch, Scottish challengers to prorogation will make their case.\n\nRemember, there are two appeals being heard. The first is by campaigner Gina Miller's team, arguing against the English High Court's decision that Mr Johnson's decision was \"purely political\" and therefore \"not a matter\" for the judiciary.\n\nThe second is by the UK government against a ruling by judges at Edinburgh's Court of Session, who said the PM's move was \"unlawful\" and intended to \"stymie\" MPs ahead of the 31 October Brexit deadline.\n\nWe ask whether the Supreme Court could overrule the government. And we explain how prorogation works.\n\nAs ever, here's our very simple guide to Brexit. Plus, we round up all Tuesday's Brexit events.\n\nIsrael election 'too close to call'\n\nWill Benjamin Netanyahu remain in power? The Israeli prime minister's right-wing Likud party is running very close to the centrist Blue and White alliance of former military chief Benny Gantz in the country's general election. Exit polls suggest there's a gap of perhaps one or two seats between them. If so, the Yisrael Beiteinu party could end up as kingmaker.\n\nThe BBC looks at what the election means for Israel. And here's how voting works and the implications for the Middle East.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nUS: Oil attack drones launched in Iran\n\nWhere did the drones and cruise missiles used to attack two Saudi Arabian oil plants on Saturday - causing huge fires and disrupting supplies - come from? The US has claimed there is a \"very compelling forensic case\" they were launched from Iran.\n\nHere are images showing the scale of the damage.\n\nBut Tehran denies any involvement, and Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have said they launched the drones. The BBC asks who is using such weapons in the Middle East.\n\nThe road to clean energy\n\nBy Simon Jack, business editor\n\nThe north Cornwall village of Delabole sits on a hillside which catches the wind - a lot of wind - all year round. It was here, arguably, where the UK's green revolution began, with an enterprising farmer, Martin Edwards.\n\n\"It all started with a storm,\" he says. \"We lost the roof of the house and my mother said if only we could use the wind rather than be done in by it - that got me thinking.\"\n\nThe next four years were spent shopping for wind turbines in Denmark, tense negotiations with the local council and overcoming a cautious community. In 1991, Edwards and his brother opened the UK's first commercial wind farm. \"The locals thought we were fruitcakes,\" says Edwards.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThe Times leads with a warning from Boris Johnson that judges looking at his decision to prorogue Parliament must stay \"out of the political arena\". But the i focuses on accusations made in the Supreme Court that the PM \"abused his power\" to silence critics of his Brexit stance. Meanwhile, the Guardian says Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would stay neutral if a second referendum happened. And the Daily Mirror reports that targeted high-dose radiotherapy could be used to cure prostate cancer \"in a week\".\n\nDaily digest\n\nJob applications Graduates \"filtered by university ranking\"\n\nChuang Chuang Giant panda's death in Thai zoo prompts questions from China\n\nCash machines Poor areas losing facilities more quickly, government warned\n\nTripAdvisor Derelict pub \"still got reviews\"\n\nIf you see one thing today\n\nImage copyright The Adventurists\n\nThe world's longest horse race\n\nIf you listen to one thing today\n\nMary Portas: On style\n\nIf you read one thing today\n\nImage copyright Netflix\n\nThe crime drama that (literally) doesn't go anywhere\n\nSign up for a morning briefing direct to your phone\n\nLookahead\n\n09:30 The Office for National Statistics reveals the CPI rate of inflation for August.\n\n17:00 Three strips from Belgian comic Tintin, estimated to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, go to auction in Paris.\n\nOn this day\n\n1970 Rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix dies, aged 27, after collapsing at a party in London.\n\nFrom elsewhere\n\nWhat climate change looks like in Australia (Guardian)\n\nWho were the ruthless warriors behind Attila the Hun?
