Power rankings: Champions League group stage 1/33 Champions League Group Stage Power Rankings All 32 teams ranked from those with the worst chances of winning it all to those with the best. Getty Images 2/33 32. Club Brugges Squeaked past Champions League minnows LASK in qualifying. Likely to find it difficult on this, the biggest stage. Getty 3/33 31. Dinamo Zagreb Passionately supported, but it is tough to forecast a Croatia 2018 style fairytale run. AFP/Getty Images 4/33 30. Slavia Prague Beat Cluj to win their place in the group stage and made life difficult for Chelsea in the Europa League last season. Getty 5/33 29. Olympiacos Stormed past FC Krasnodar in the Play-off round, but that might be the height of their Champions League efforts this season AFP/Getty Images 6/33 28. Genk Surprise Belgian champions last season, but may struggle to step up. Gheorghe Hagi never won the Champions League as a player, but I doubt son Ianis will right his father's wrongs in his first season in Belgium. AFP/Getty Images 7/33 27. Lokomotiv Moscow Some canny additions with plenty of European experience to complement a strong Russian base, but not enough top-end quality to predict progression. Getty Images 8/33 26. Galatasaray Jean Michael Seri and Ryan Babel have joined the Turkish champions, which bodes well after Fulham's efforts last season, even if Babel was something of a find. Europa League a realistic target. AFP/Getty Images 9/33 25. Red Star Belgrade The Serbian side will be bothersome at home, and have just installed a tank outside their ground for extra intimidation points, as they were last year, when they beat Liverpool. Lack true forward quality, though. Getty Images 10/33 24. FC Salzburg Austrian champions in each of the last six seasons, which counts for something. Not much, mind you, hence the low ranking. Getty Images 11/33 23. Atalanta Punched well above their weight as the surprise Serie A packages last season, but they may struggle more at this level. Getty Images 12/33 22. Shakhtar Donetsk A faded force from the heady Uefa Cup winning days, but they remain an entertaining Brazilian/Ukranian ying and yang. They'll have at least one 5-4 result, or something along those lines. AFP/Getty Images 13/33 21. Benfica Benfica remain extremely talented despite the departure of Joao Felix, but the hardened centre that is required for Champions League success isn't quite there. AFP/Getty Images 14/33 20. Lille An odd mishmash of forgotten faces (Jose Fonte, Loic Remy) and potential stars (Timothy Weah, Renato Sanches, Jonathan Bamba) but that might be to their detriment. Boom or bust. AFP/Getty Images 15/33 19. Zenit St Petersburg Ever a tricky trip, Zenit have a sneakily fun squad. Malcom will look to rebound from his torrid time at Barcelona. Getty Images 16/33 18. Valencia Europa League semi-finalists after dropping down last season, the squad is a coherent one with experience. Round of 16 likely if they get a friendly group draw. Bongarts/Getty Images 17/33 17. Lyon More impressive in the Champions League than Ligue 1 last season, in many ways. Gone are Tanguy Ndombele, Ferland Mendy and Nabil Fekir, however - a tough ask to replace such quality. AFP/Getty Images 18/33 16. Bayer Leverkusen They've lost Julian Brandt, but in Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and particularly Kai Havertz possess some of the best young talent in Germany. They'll be in the Round of 16 mix. Bongarts/Getty Images 19/33 15. Chelsea Untested manager, untested squad, and lost their only true attacking difference-maker in the summer. The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw. AFP/Getty Images 22/33 12. RB Leipzig Dark horses part two. The installation of Julian Naglesmann as manager will further stimulate a squad that, if it clicks, can cause serious damage. AFP/Getty Images 23/33 11. Inter Milan Antonio Conte is a shrewd appointment who will drill his side well defensively, and Romelu Lukaku is a proven goalscorer, scoff as you might. Diego Godin could be talismanic. Getty Images 24/33 10. Tottenham Hotspur Calm yourselves, Spurs fans, but it is hard not to forecast a regression to something resembling the mean. Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

I am focused on starting this Champions League in a good way.\u201d\n\nThat could be imperative as in a group that also contains Bayern Munich and Red Star Belgrade, they cannot repeat their horrible start to last season\u2019s competition.\n\nThey had just one point after three games and needed an amazing set of results to make it through to the knockout stage.\n\nThey will be heavy favourites to win in Athens on Wednesday night and Pochettino has urged them to live up to their billing.\n\n\u201cWe cannot talk in different way, a few months ago we played final of Champions League and (playing) Olympiacos will put us in this level of favourites for the game,\u201d Pochettino said.\n\n\u201cI respect the opposition and the history and it is going to be tough here. You need to show why you are favourites.\n\n\u201cIf you are better than opponents then OK, you were better but before the game in the Champions League you need to show full respect and Olympiacos are a very good team.\n\n\u201cTheir record here in this stadium in Europe is so good and it\u2019s going to be a tough atmosphere, the first game of group stage and excitement will be high.\n\n\u201cThey will have good players and if we are not focused and don\u2019t take the game in our best condition we are going to suffer.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Tottenham\u00a0manager Mauricio Pochettino says his side are not among the Champions League favourites this season.
