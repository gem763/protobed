Thankfully, a stint in rehab helped him conquer them.\n\nSo what was this elusive love Elton was searching for?\n\nFeeling let down by his own, I believe for many decades he was looking for the love of surrogate parents.\n\nAnd that, of course, is the greatest irony of all.\n\nFor ultimately, it turns out it has not been finding stand-in parents, people to pamper, indulge, to infantilise him, which has made Elton truly happy for the first time in his life.\n\nIt has instead been finding a husband in partner of more than 25 years and \u201csoul mate\u201d, film producer David Furnish, who is an equal, not a carer or manager.\n\nAnd most surprising of all, it has been becoming a parent himself, to his two young sons Zachary, eight and \u00adsix-year-old Elijah.\n\nAnd I imagine this comes as no bigger surprise to anyone than 72 year-old Elton, who never saw himself as a dad.\n\n(Image: Retna Ltd)\n\n\u201cI always said no to having kids,\u201d he once conceded. \u201cBecause I\u2019m too old, too set in my ways, too selfish, and the lifestyle doesn\u2019t suit me.\u201d\n\nAll that began to shift the day he met David in October 1993.\n\n\u201cI wanted to meet new people so I rang up a friend in London and said, \u2018Could you please rattle some new people together for dinner here Saturday?\u2019\u201d\n\nAmong those new faces was Canadian advertising executive Furnish, who\u2019d not been particularly keen on coming along.\n\nHe soon changed his tune - the mutual attraction between the pair was immediate.\n\nElton said: \u201cHe had a real job, his own apartment, a car. He was independent. I didn\u2019t need to take care of him.\u201d\n\nThe next day Elton called David, who is 15 years his junior, to invite him round for a Chinese takeaway.\n\nRight from the start theirs was an equal relationship; there was nothing parental or manager/superstar about it.\n\nThat David has refused to be a parent figure to him, has actually been the key to their success.\n\nDavid wasn\u2019t frightened to tell him what was what. We see that very clearly in Tantrums and Tiaras, the candid documentary they made together about Elton in 1997.\n\nElton once said: \u201cI knew he was the one because he is not afraid of me. He always tells me exactly what he thinks.\u201d\n\nYet David and Elton still clearly have a deeply affectionate, romantic relationship. The pair still write each other a letter every Saturday, the weekday they met, no matter where in the world they are.\n\nThey entered into a civil partnership in 2005, and in 2014 after the law change, got married.\n\n\u201cFor David and I, being able to openly love and commit to one another, and for that to be recognized and celebrated, is what makes life truly worth living,\u201d Elton wrote afterwards.\n\nThe stability of their relationship enabled Elton to think the previously unthinkable: becoming a dad.\n\nIn 2009 he and David attempted unsuccessfully to adopt a little boy called Lev and his brother, who he\u2019d met on a visit to a Ukrainian orphanage.\n\nThat was a tipping point. Elton said: \u201cThis boy was trying to tell me something. He was trying to say, through God or someone else, you can be a dad, look at how much pleasure I gave you in an hour and a half.\u201d\n\nIt finally seemed a natural progression to have their own sons, via the same surrogate they say they \u201clove as a sister\u201d in California, followed shortly.\n\nElton has now made the decision to retire from touring, to be home with his lads in Windsor, to do the school run, making sure they do chores, tidy their rooms, teaching them values of kindness, and watching them play football.\n\nElton the doing father is not the Elton I met.\n\nFor the first time his life is about other people, not him, and he admits he has never felt so content within an environment which previously would have felt mundane.\n\nHe explained recently: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic being a dad. But ten years ago if you\u2019d have told me that, I\u2019d have said you\u2019re crazy. I have learned that a parent\u2019s capacity for love is endless.\u201d\n\nSo in giving so much love, it seems to have finally sated his own need to be loved - something which always struck me as a psychosis, firmly rooted in what he believes was in large part an unhappy childhood.\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\nAs I\u2019ve already mentioned, Elton has repeatedly talked about how he feels let down by his parents.\n\nThe pictures he paints of his mother and father, Sheila and Stanley Dwight are always fraught with emotion.\n\nStanley, he maintains, was cold.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe was a tough and unemotional man. Hard. In the RAF. He was dismissive, disappointed and finally absent. I just wanted him to acknowledge what I\u2019d done. But he never did.\u201d\n\nOthers have disagreed, and certainly I have been told Stanley would take his son to football matches, and even bought the child prodigy his first piano.\n\nBut whether completely true, partly true, or not true at all, Elton has held on to the negative.\n\nHe was much closer to his mother Sheila, but again the relationship seems to have carried its own share of resentment.\n\nHe now says: \u201cshe always seemed to be looking for a reason not to be happy, always seemed to be in search of a fight\u201d.\n\nThe pair were estranged for years. She infamously invited an Elton lookalike to her 90th birthday.\n\nSheila maintained she never actually got to meet her grandchildren. Elton on the other hand now says it was her choice not to meet Zachary and Elijah.\n\nElton once explained: \u201cI don\u2019t hate her, but I don\u2019t want her in my life.\u201d\n\nShe in turn told him: \u201cI love you but I don\u2019t like you at all.\u201d\n\nThey only reconciled around a year before Sheila\u2019s death in 2017.\n\nBut a friend of hers who remained in contact until the end confided to me relations were never as good before her death as Elton has painted publicly.\n\nOne comment Sheila made to the same friend was that \u2018Himself\u2019, as she unflatteringly called Elton, only stopped shouting at people when he was performing...\n\nWith all this personal baggage, perhaps it makes sense that the best remedy for an unhappy childhood, is to give a happy one to others. Just as he\u2019s doing with his two boys.\n\nResponsibility for two little people has transformed him from the man-child he\u2019s been most of his life.\n\nUntil Elton became a father, he could never truly grow up himself. He was stuck.\n\nSuperstars don\u2019t grow up \u2013 they are allowed to have tantrums, they have everything done for them.\n\nEven David allowed Elton his outbursts. But his kids won\u2019t.\n\nHis decision to be there for his boys by retiring from touring says it all.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nAfter Zachary\u2019s birth he said: \u201cEverything is about him now.\u201d And it is.\n\nHe\u2019s putting them first, and wants to be there for them, their first days at school and other landmark moments.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey know what their daddy does but I never bring Elton home.\u201d\n\nNor, importantly, does he want to be the distant dad he recalls his own father was to him.\n\nHe\u2019s chosen to be hands on, to pick them up at the school gate where he\u2019s not a global music icon but just another dad discussing lessons, packed lunches and school uniforms.\n\n\u201cMy children need to be with me and I need to be with them,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a godparent to Sean Lennon, he saw how his friend John was absent for much of his young life.\n\nWhen I wrote my biography of Lennon, Yoko Ono, told me that making Elton the boy\u2019s godfather had a touch of the mercenary.\n\n\u201cJohn said that because Elton was gay, he wouldn\u2019t have any kids of his own to leave his money to.\u201d\n\nHow wrong that turned out to be.", "description": "He'd once said no to having kids, but now puts his boys first and has spoken about how fantastic it is to be a dad", "authors": ["Philip Norman", "Image", "Getty Images For Ejaf", "Retna Ltd", "Handout", "Getty Images Europe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531919.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_23rd-Annual-Elton-John-AIDS-Foundation-Academy-Awards-Viewing-Party-Inside.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
