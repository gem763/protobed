China is a state \u201cwe\u2019re trying to make a deal with,\u201d Mr. Trump said in response to a reporter\u2019s question.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had good moments with China. We\u2019ve had bad moments with China. Right now, we\u2019re in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal. If we make it, it will be the biggest trade deal ever made,\u201d he said Oct. 4.\n\nThe president added: \u201cI would like to get along with China if we can, and if we can, that\u2019s great. If we can\u2019t, that\u2019s OK, too.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump was adamant that reaching a trade deal with China depends on its benefits for the United States.\n\n\u201cIf the deal is not going to be 100% for us, then we\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d he said.\n\nChina appears to be struggling economically as a result of U.S. tariffs, as unemployment increases and Chinese firms face supply chain disruptions. Foreign companies, including U.S. firms, are relocating from China to other nations, Mr. Trump said.\n\nWith Chinese trade negotiators in Washington this week for another round of talks, Trump administration officials have been sparring over whether to make concessions in furtherance of a deal. Pro-deal supporters appear willing to give in to some Chinese demands to modify a draft deal worked out in May but turned down by Beijing.\n\nA Trump administration official said the draft trade deal was rejected by senior Chinese Communist Party leaders who recognized that signing it would be an admission of past illicit activities and unfair practices. The draft deal recognized that China stole American intellectual property, forced technology transfers from American firms, hacked U.S. data, manipulated the currency, paid subsidies to state-owned companies and exported deadly fentanyl to the United States.\n\nA White House report made public last year on \u201cChinese economic aggression\u201d estimated that Beijing was obtaining between $250 billion and $600 billion annually in American intellectual property and technology.\n\nThe president is adamant that any deal must prevent the hemorrhage of U.S. know-how.\n\n\u201cThis will be much more than a trade deal,\u201d when finished, the official said.\n\nArmy fails fitness test\n\nA leaked Army briefing slide reveals that the Army\u2019s new Combat Fitness Test, a planned successor to the service\u2019s earlier Physical Fitness Test, is producing large-scale test failures by women soldiers.\n\nFormer Army officer David Brown reported Oct. 5 that the leaked analysis of pass/fail rates on the Army Combat Fitness Test shows it is \u201ccatastrophically ill-considered,\u201d setting up the Army\u2019s women to fail.\n\nA total of 2001 men passed the test with 848 failing, a pass rate of 70%.\n\nBut for women soldiers the pass/fail statistics were stark: Out of 357 women who took the fitness test, 300 failed \u2014 a whopping 84%.\n\nMr. Brown wrote that he supported the earlier fitness test that he believes produced troops who responded to it by working to become fit. The old test also cost much less than the new test.\n\n\u201cThe Army Combat Fitness Test is an unbridled, unparalleled, unimaginable disaster,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to Mr. Brown, soldiers who fail their physical training test are \u201cflagged,\u201d blocking attendance at key military schools like the basic leader course or airborne school.\n\n\u201cAnd if somehow you get there anyway, when you\u2019re tested again you\u2019ll be turned around and sent home,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot be promoted. You cannot be reclassified into another [military occupational specialty].\u201d\n\nUltimately, the test will eliminate women from the service, he said.\n\nMr. Brown told Inside the Ring said some negative responses to his column were mainly due to the Army describing the test as a \u201ccombat\u201d test.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t some special test soldiers take before going to combat. This is a regular physical fitness test that finance clerks and dental hygienists and supply people will take once or twice a year, stateside,\u201d he said. Given the 84% failure rate for women, the Army could lose 300,000 soldiers, he added.\n\nThe test could be formally adopted in less than a year. It is made up of six parts, including a strength dead-lift; standing power throw, hand release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, leg tuck and a two-mile run in under 20 minutes.\n\nThe slide was published on ClearanceJobs.com.\n\nThe U.S. Army Center for Initial Military Training said in a statement the initial testing phase of the Army Combat Fitness Test sought to assess physical fitness from 63 battalions.\n\n\u201cThis was the first time a majority of the Soldier\u2019s had experienced the age and gender neutral test, which directly correlates to Warrior Tasks and Battle Drills,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe leaked chart was not an official document, the statement said.\n\n\u201cOnce Soldiers have adapted to the new test, we expect success and performance rates to be similar to the current Army Physical Fitness Test,\u201d the statement said.\n\nChinese firm mulls Biden request\n\nThe Chinese private equity company linked to Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, is considering whether to respond to President Trump\u2019s call for an investigation into a possible influence operation.\n\nJonathan Li Xiansheng, chief executive of BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co., said that the firm is working on a response to questions about the younger Mr. Biden\u2019s role in the company, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nMr. Trump called on China last week to investigate whether Mr. Biden, a board member of BHR, relied on his father\u2019s influence to secure $1.5 billion in funding from Chinese investors.\n\nOn Oct. 6, the president tweeted that liberal news outlets were protecting the Bidens and that Hunter Biden was paid $100,000 a month from a Ukrainian company \u201cand separately got 1.5 Billion Dollars from China despite no experience and for no apparent reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions? As lawyers & others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the $1.5 billion figure mentioned by the president appears based on a fundraising target announced by BHR.\n\nMr. Biden owns 10% of a private-equity firm called Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co. that shares a website with BHR. The company funneled $2.5 billion from financial backers into companies in the automotive, energy, mining and technology sectors, the newspaper reported.\n\nChina bans \u2018South Park\u2019\n\nChina recently forced the National Basketball Association to apologize for a tweet by one of its executive\u2019s in support of democracy in Hong Kong, where protesters continue to hammer authorities in a fight against creeping Chinese authoritarianism there.\n\nBut the cartoon satire \u201cSouth Park\u201d is not backing down from a recent episode that got the program banned in China.\n\nThe episode showed fictional character Randy Marsh, a Colorado marijuana grower, traveling to China where he is arrested upon arrival with a suitcase of samples he had hoped to use for breaking into the Chinese market.\n\nAt a prison labor camp, Chinese guards are shown torturing prisoners and forcing them to make products for export. The American prisoner then meets Winnie the Pooh \u2014 another character banned in China because of dissidents\u2019 use of the bear to covertly criticize Chinese President Xi Jinping. Critics say Mr. Xi slightly resembles author\u2019s A.A. Milne\u2019s Pooh.\n\nChinese censors were not amused.\n\n\u201cSouth Park\u201d creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone issued a mock apology after the Chinese government censored all access to all of the show\u2019s popular past episodes, which had been available on the Chinese internet and social media platforms.\n\n\u201cLike the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Follow Bill Gertz on Twitter @BillGertz.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
