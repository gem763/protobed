John Barentine, Director of Public Policy at the International Dark-Sky Association, told Forbes the \u201csolution\u201d to Chengdu\u2019s problems \u201cpotentially creates significant new environmental problems\u201d - and could increase light pollution by a factor of 47.\n\n\"The Chengdu \u2018artificial moon\u2019 would have the effect of significantly increasing the nighttime brightness of an already light-polluted city, creating problems for both Chengdu\u2019s residents, who are unable to screen out the unwanted light, as well as for the urban wildlife population that can\u2019t simply go inside and close the shutters,\u201d he said.\n\nIf China's plans for a fake moon sounds implausible, reflecting the Sun\u2019s rays back to Earth at night has actually been done before.\n\nIn 1993, Russia successfully coaxed a beam 5km wide from a 20-metre solar mirror called Znamya 2 that was roughly as bright as a full moon. However, a piece of the reflective umbrella caught on an antenna as it was unfurling, and the satellite was deorbited after a couple of hours.", "description": "Scientists are planning to launch a 'fake moon' satellite in China to act as an alternative to traditional streetlights.
