Scammers will often ride the #CashAppFridays and try to direct giveaway participants to fake websites that closely resemble the Cash App page. These pages, however, may be used to intercept a victim\u2019s credentials and grant the scammer access to their accounts. After the account is compromised, the phishing sites will sometimes act to convince the user that the payment has simply failed in order to allay their suspicions.\n\nOther scammers rely on impersonation, typically masquerading as an official Cash App account or service representative.\n\nScreenshot: Tenable\n\nAvoiding scams isn\u2019t difficult. Just remember, \u201cNeither Cash App nor any artist or celebrity offering to give away money will ever ask you to send money as a form of verification,\u201d Tenable says. \u201cFlipping money isn\u2019t real.\u201d\n\nBesides that, remain sceptical of any tweets or posts on other social media offering to give away free money. If sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you receive a link to a login page from someone claiming you\u2019ve won a Cash App giveaway, \u201cit is almost certainly a phishing site,\u201d said Tenable said.\n\nIn a statement, Square said it is aware of the online scams and that it\u2019s working with social media companies to combat them. \u201cAs a reminder, the Cash App team will never ask customers to send them money, nor will they solicit a customer\u2019s PIN or sign-in code outside of the app,\u201d the company said.\n\nSquare noted that Cash App only has two Twitter accounts: @cashapp and @cashsupport, both of which are verified. \u201cIf you believe you have fallen victim to a scam, you should contact Cash App support through the app or website immediately,\u201d it said.", "description": "Twitter and Instagram have become inundated with scams targeting users of Cash App, the popular person-to-person payment service, according to new research released Thursday....", "authors": ["James Whitbrook", "Gordon Jackson", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/jbigwztf9se9eckzfgfe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
