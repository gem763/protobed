Many respondents listed multiple, intersecting identities, and some discussed seeking acceptance and community and finding it right here in New York City.\n\nAs these unique descriptions poured in, we were reminded that we are all humans with a story to tell.\n\n\u201cI feel like with all I\u2019ve been through that my life is a calling. That I have a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to say: I am here. Who can I help? What else can I do?\u201d\n\nWest recently left a position as a senior design director for a shoe brand, but it does not mean he is slowing down or thinking about retirement. That\u2019s just not who he is, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here as proof. You just keep on,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t give up. Live your life. Take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nThe current outlook on H.I.V. and AIDS is different than it was 33 years ago. There are treatment plans involving medicines that manage the disease and some believe a cure is on the horizon . But still, West said, he knows that being diagnosed can take a mental and emotional toll on the newly diagnosed, especially if they are young, poor and black.\n\nWest said he shared his story with the hope that it inspired others: \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that people, especially the young black boys out there, understand you can continue living your life.\u201d\n\nHis career would continue on with fanfare: vice president of footwear at Ann Taylor; senior design director at Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein; top roles at Target and American Outfitters. \u201cIn spite of what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d he said,\u201d I\u2019ve pursued my dreams.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour guess is as good as mine,\u201d he said when asked how he believed he survived, relatively unscathed. \u201cAll I know is I have survived. And I\u2019m not only happy about that. I\u2019m very proud about that.\u201d\n\nWhile his friends and millions more around the world succumbed to the virus that causes AIDS, West not only managed to live, he did so while barely experiencing any major symptoms of the crippling disease.\n\nHe was a shoe designer, working alongside the couturiers at the Givenchy headquarters in Paris. He had already achieved a great deal in his career. By the time he was in his 30s, the poor, black boy from southeast Washington D.C. had graduated from the Pratt Institute and moved to Europe, where he would spend more than a decade designing footwear \u2014 in France as well as Italy and Germany \u2014 for brands like Christian Dior, Louis Feraud and Esprit de Corp Europe. If the run ended, he thought, it had been a good one.\n\nBut once West\u2019s own H.I.V. positive diagnosis arrived, the end, he felt, was near: \u201cIt was a death sentence.\u201d\n\nA gay man living in Paris in 1986, he was attending, he said, a funeral a week. He had lost a dozen acquaintances to what was being called \u201cthe gay plague\u201d and would go on to lose dozens more, including his close friend, Patrick Kelly, the trailblazing black fashion designer .\n\nAt 33, Melvin West knew it was only a matter of time \u2014 months maybe, a year for sure \u2014 before he would be dead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, oh yeah, we have to go out and live authentically,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOne thing I think about a lot is: How many humans does a human in New York look at, as opposed to anywhere else in the world? Not even in L.A. would someone come across so many people, because you\u2019re in your car half the time. But in New York, most of us don\u2019t own cars. Something really special about queerness, broadly, in New York City is that we have to be more visibly out more often, just as a result of how the city works.\u201d\n\nA military veteran, Bishop has lived in the South and Pacific Northwest. But it is New York City, she said, where her role as a provocateur feels most natural.\n\nA commitment to being political is central to Bishop\u2019s identity as a self-described kinky, femme, polyamorist dyke. She likes women and sex and she wants you to know that about her.\n\nFeminine, Bishop argued, is often seen as docile, tame and meek. But femme for her is a way of \u201cweaponizing femininity\u201d and repurposing it. \u201cIt\u2019s a reclamation of this thing that is so often seen as less than. Taking it and empowering it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rose with its thorns intact.\u201d\n\nShe considers her use of \u2018femme,\u2019 for example, strategically chosen for etymological focus on the feminine. \u201cThere\u2019s something powerful in the erasure of the masculine,\u201d she said.\n\nTo understand the words Bishop employs to describe herself is to understand Bishop herself. \u201cI exist very politically,\u201d she said.\n\nBishop feels there\u2019s a growing danger, particularly as a member of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, in getting too safe and too innocuous.\n\nAnd although \u201cqueer\u201d has been resurrected by L.G.B.T.Q. millennials, Bishop is not interested in the word. She said it, like Pride itself, had been co-opted and commandeered.\n\nIt\u2019s why she prefers calling herself a dyke instead of a lesbian and why she will coyly call herself a pervert, knowing full well the impact of that word.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m evolving more each day, taking things step-by-step to be more different and confident in trying new things,\u201d Argueta said. \u201cReally, it\u2019s all a learning experience of me trying to figure out who I am.\u201d\n\nArgueta feels most comfortable expressing their masculine identity, but said they were entertaining the idea of embracing makeup as a kind of first step toward more deliberate feminine gender expression. That might be as far as Argueta goes in changing their outward appearance, they said. Or it might not.\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel like a boy and I express myself more masculinely,\u201d they said. \u201cBut sometimes I feel like a girl. Why should I be put into a box?\u201d\n\n\u201cI began to think: Why should I have to act a certain way?\u201d Argueta said.\n\nArgueta became a Brooklyn resident in 2017 while enrolled at Baruch College. It was during this time that they began to spend more time in New York\u2019s L.G.B.T.Q. communities and learn more about identity, expression and attraction.\n\n\u201cMoving to New York City gave me a greater understanding of who I was,\u201d Argueta said.\n\n\u201cWe call it machismo. Men are expected to be very masculine and manly and to be interested in women,\u201d Argueta said. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\nLiving on the outskirts of heteronormativity was a struggle where Argueta grew up, they said. An immigrant, they came to the United States from El Salvador with their family when they were 7, planting their roots in the predominantly Latino Brentwood community in Long Island.\n\nGenderfluid describes a person who does not solely identify as one gender identity or another, choosing instead to have the flexibility to fluctuate between genders or express multiple genders simultaneously. Pansexuality describes a person who experiences attraction to people regardless of their sex or gender identity.\n\n\u201cHere\u201d for Argueta is the realization that they are genderfluid and pansexual.\n\n\u201cI just remember thinking: This can\u2019t be it,\u201d they said. \u201cI know it\u2019s clich\u00e9, but getting here has been a journey.\u201d\n\nArgueta has always known they weren\u2019t straight. They remember having feelings for boys as early as middle school. But after they told their mother they might be bisexual they couldn\u2019t fight a lingering curiosity.\n\nYet wading through that murkiness of uncertainty, they said, they have discovered a kind of truth, and by extension a semblance of their identity.\n\nIf there is one thing Marvin Argueta \u2014 who uses they, them and theirs pronouns \u2014 is sure about, it is that they are, in fact, unsure.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid struggling with this stuff, and there was nothing in my world that could support me,\u201d Bliss said, \u201cit was the community in Buffalo of butch dykes and high femmes that taught me what love looks like.\u201d\n\nTen years ago, Bliss and her longtime partner, Maria, had a son, Mateo. Then in 2015, the couple married, just days after the Supreme Court passed the decision that legalized same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cYou could still walk around the street holding your girlfriend\u2019s hand, but it was just a lot riskier,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was a time when, Bliss said, being openly gay in the city was more common, but there was still discrimination against the L.G.B.T.Q. community.\n\n\u201cThere used to be this energy in the city,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was never air-conditioning and so it was like every door would be open, and you could always hear the music pouring out into the street.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Sarah Lawrence College in 1993, where she studied creative writing, Bliss moved to the East Village. In the city, she waited tables for cash and danced nights away at local gay clubs.\n\nAn older lesbian, who ran a local gay bar called M.C. Comptons, would let Bliss and other youths run the coat check as a means of subtle exposure to the culture.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I say I was raised by butch dykes and high femmes,\u201d she said of the women who ran the group. \u201cIt was honestly, for lack of a better term, a safe space to a kid who was gay.\u201d\n\nAs a teenager, curious and exploring her sexuality, Bliss joined the Gay and Lesbian Youth of Buffalo, where she connected with peers and attended information sessions.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I moved to New York is I didn\u2019t want to be the only one,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the only lesbian. I didn\u2019t want to be the only Asian-American. I didn\u2019t want to be the only brown person.\u201d\n\nAdopted by a couple who found her at an orphanage near the U.S. Air Force base where they lived, Bliss was raised in the suburbs of Buffalo, N.Y. She said she had always dreamed of living in New York City, and collected magazine clippings and pictures of the city, plastering them on her bedroom wall.\n\nIt was the 1970s in the Philippines when a young mother checked into a hospital just outside the country\u2019s capital city of Manila, gave birth to a daughter and walked out, leaving her newborn child behind.\n\nThe lizard, whom Gervich calls \u201cGeedy,\u201d was just one more untraditional aspect of their and Allison\u2019s relationship: Not every couple decides to raise a reptile together, they said.\n\nIn the meantime, much of Gervich\u2019s time is spent taking care of King Geedorah, their 8-year-old bearded dragon, named after the Kaiju monster in \u201cGodzilla.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor my own child\u2019s journey,\u201d Gervich said, \u201cI would tell them: \u2018Listen to yourself. Trust yourself. And really listen to what your heart says because the world is filled with these competing voices telling you to doubt yourself.\u201d\n\nGervich thought of the adversity their child might face, but took comfort in the idea of being able to console them through experience and insight.\n\n\u201cTimes are different but the journey is still hard, and you never really figure yourself out and you can still have doubts,\u201d Gervich said. \u201cEspecially for nonbinary people, the doubts aren\u2019t just, \u2018Do I really want this thing?\u2019 But it could even feel like a question of \u2018Am I real? Am I really feeling this?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey are considering female hormone therapy, but they put the idea on hold in an effort to start a family.\n\nIn 2012, Gervich and Allison moved to Brooklyn to find better career opportunities and found a sense of belonging in the city. Gervich landed a job as an assistant editor at an independent media company and has fully embraced their nonbinary gender identity.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have continued on this journey without her,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cI came out to her at about the six-month mark, around the time she was moving in,\u201d they said. As their relationship progressed, so did Gervich\u2019s gender identity. According to Gervich, Allison, through love, had come to appreciate Gervich\u2019s progressively developing feminine qualities.\n\nGervich met their wife at an Oktoberfest party while attending college in Portland, Ore. That night, the couple stepped outside to take a cigarette break, even though they were both trying to quit smoking at the time.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re faking it all the time, you just never feel good,\u201d they said. \u201cWhile I had queer friends, who I loved, I just couldn\u2019t accept it about myself.\u201d\n\nGervich was raised in West Des Moines, Iowa, and transferred schools when they were young because of bullying. They responded to the bullying by trying to embrace masculinity.\n\n\u201cMy wife would be \u2018Mom,\u2019\u201d they said. \u201cAnd I think what we settled on is that our child would call me \u2018Baba.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife and I are trying to start a family in the next few years, and we\u2019re trying to do it the old-fashioned way,\u201d said Gervich, whose wife, Allison, was assigned female at birth and identifies as a woman. The two have been together for about a decade and were married two years ago at a farm in Hillsdale, N.Y.\n\nFor Jacob \u201cJayne\u201d Gervich, an assistant film editor from South Slope, Brooklyn \u2014 who uses the pronouns they, them, and theirs \u2014 identity felt like an elusive concept. Gervich, who was assigned male at birth, went from small-town Midwest boy to a self-proclaimed nonbinary trans-femme film editor and homemaking spouse. And one description they hope to attain in the future: a loving parent.\n\nThey are in a new home now, and he said the entire process had helped him realize he\u2019s stronger than he knew. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be who I am if I didn\u2019t go through the things I\u2019ve gone through,\u201d he said. \u201cI just feel like I should take that and help others, you know?\u201d\n\nLarson-Curry said he and his wife (who is a veteran and also transgender) experienced a period of homelessness when friends they were sharing an apartment with, angry at their relationship, forced them out.\n\nLarson-Curry also calls himself a \u201cgamer geek,\u201d and said he would like to use that hobby and his interest in web design to one day create websites and apps that help veterans, the homeless and transgender people with resources, like where to find a housing, a suitable doctor, or a mental health professional.\n\n\u201cI remember looking in the mirror and saying, \u2018This is the person I\u2019ve been seeing my whole life. This is who I want everybody to see.\u2019 That was just really helpful in confirming that, yes, this is definitely me.\u201d\n\nBy 2016, with the support of his parents, Larson-Curry began taking testosterone. About a year ago he began to see certain changes \u2014 his face became more structured, his voice a bit deeper. The effect, he said, was remarkable.\n\n\u201cMy self-confidence has been raised significantly since I figured out this is my identity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy friends were the first ones to help me realize I wasn\u2019t just gender queer. That what I was experiencing was something more.\u201d\n\nHe tried for years to live with the dissonance. Maybe, he thought, he was a tomboy. Then, when he became attracted to girls, he thought maybe he was bisexual. At the age of 19, Larson-Curry told his close friends how much he disliked wearing women\u2019s clothing \u2014 and they helped him find his truth.\n\n\u201cAs trans folks, we understand we\u2019re born in the wrong body, we just want our mind and body to match.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Larson-Curry identified as a girl. But even at the age of nine, he knew that it wasn\u2019t a fit. He knew people weren\u2019t seeing the real him.\n\n\u201cI was asked to play the role of the older guy, so I got to wear my dad\u2019s clothes,\u201d Larson-Curry said. \u201cI just remember being so much more happy in that role. I remember feeling free.\u201d\n\nHe was in a fourth grade musical, and he and his classmates were tasked with performing the Beatles hit \u201cWhen I\u2019m Sixty Four,\u201d a song about lovers growing old together.\n\n\u201cI want people to know,\u201d he added, \u201cthat I consider that a beautiful thing. It\u2019s not a sin, it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to say being gay is just one part of me and not an important part of me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I feel like it\u2019s an extremely important part of who I am and it defines and it characterizes how I see the world, how I move in the world and how I interact with people.\u201d\n\nAs he has become more comfortable in his life, Jawaid\u2019s thinking has shifted over the years.\n\nHe often thinks back to his mother\u2019s reaction when he first told her he was gay. \u201cShe would stay up at night and just cry. She thought being gay was a disease, then a disability, then a phase.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was extremely difficult to reconcile the different worlds in which I existed,\u201d he said. \u201cOne that is much more accepting of L.G.B.T. culture, almost to the point of being shocked that I would be apprehensive about my sexuality, and the other completely the opposite, not even understanding what being gay means.\u201d\n\nThere were more contradictions, Jawaid said, when he came to the United States for college and found himself in a culture completely different from the one he was used to.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of contradictions that were exposed to me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I realized this system could not be as true as I thought it was.\u201d\n\nWith that question came doubt, and the realization that he had other questions. Why was he allowed to live in comfort while others around him suffered?\n\nGrowing up, Islam was the pillar of Jawaid\u2019s life. He said he was \u201cvery religious,\u201d praying five times a day and striving to live as piously as he could. But as he entered his teenage years, he found himself attracted to men. \u201cI remember thinking: Why would God make me like this but then tell me that this is wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven now, I can only think of one gay, South Asian man, and that is Tan France,\u201d he said, referring to one of the stars of \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d the popular Netflix reboot. \u201cWe have to have more.\u201d\n\nStill, Jawaid has faced challenges. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t have any role models who were like me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have that kind of fear, living in New York City and being so privileged,\u201d said Jawaid, a graduate of Princeton University and the co-founder of Isometric Studio , an architecture and design firm he runs with his partner, Andy Chen.\n\nMahmud was shot and killed in 2015 after hosting a debate at The Second Floor.\n\nLike Jawaid, Sabeen Mahmud was born and raised in Karachi Pakistan. She had become a well-known progressive human rights activist, and the founder of The Second Floor, a progressive cafe and popular queer-affirming space in Karachi aimed at fostering open dialogue.\n\nWhen Waqas Jawaid considered the risks, to both himself and his family, of sitting with The New York Times to share his thoughts as a gay, partnered Pakistani man at odds with the Islamic faith, he first thought about his friend Sabeen Mahmud.\n\n\u201cOf course transitioning is going to be a process,\u201d Kozub said, \u201cbut at the same time, now that I\u2019m embracing this part of my identity, there is a part of me that feels like I can finally move on with who I am. I can finally accomplish what I want without compromise.\u201d\n\nComing out is not solely the action of informing loved ones about your sexual or gender identity, she said, but a deep introspective process of discovering who you are.\n\nIn May, Kozub, who double-majored in journalism and American studies, graduated from Fordham University as class valedictorian. She used her deadname (a reference to the name she was given at birth) one last time to mark the beginning of a new chapter.\n\nBut holding onto those accomplishments gave her a sense of victory. \u201cI did this thing and I\u2019m still choosing the path I want anyway,\u201d she said.\n\nBeing an Eagle Scout, which she reached in 2015, has \u201ctaken on a deeper meaning for me since coming out as a trans woman,\u201d Kozub said. \u201cI initially had this impulse where I felt like I had to shed, disown or reorganize things in my life that didn\u2019t line up with my gender identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt that if I got the rank of Eagle,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d be crossing a threshold that\u2019s seen as one of the most prestigious accomplishments of young manhood,\u201d she said.\n\nFrom an early age, she dreamed of becoming an Eagle Scout, the highest rank in the scouts.\n\n\u201cThe two biggest things that I was expected to accomplish in my life were both entirely dependent on me identifying as a man,\u201d she said.\n\nKozub, who was assigned male at birth, grew up with her parents and brother in a suburban home in Woodbridge, N.J, attended the same all-boys Catholic high school as her father and brother and joined the Boy Scouts.\n\n\u201cI had gotten to the point that I realized how miserable I was,\u201d Kozub said. \u201cMy life just felt joyless and mechanical. I was successful in my academics, I was successful in my career aspirations, but I still just felt this deep unfulfillment. I remember thinking, \u2018I\u2019m achieving more than I ever dreamed of. Why do I feel so joyless? How do I move on from here? Because something needs to change.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Easter Sunday this year, Sophie Kozub, 21, overcame the most daunting tribulation she had faced in her life to date: She came out as a transgender woman.\n\n\u201cI thought I knew something about community before that moment,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the unconditional support I got from my friends really taught me the value of community.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath, Stewart\u2019s friends in the Sirens Women\u2019s Motorcycle Club helped clean her house, did her laundry and more.\n\nAnd then, in 2011, Stewart herself was badly injured while riding her motorcycle in Red Hook. A car hit her as she came to a stop at a red light. The accident shattered her pelvis and caused nine breaks in her lumbar spine and rib damage.\n\nIt was riding, and the community she found through it, that helped her through a number of trying times. She has lost two significant others: one former partner died in a motorcycle accident when she was struck by a truck while riding, another girlfriend died from cervical cancer.\n\n\u201cRiding a motorcycle just felt like the one thing I was meant to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was part of me. It was freedom. It was excitement. It was and it continues to be, for all the women that I know who ride, incredibly empowering.\u201d\n\nStewart, who now works as a scenic artist and sculptor, put up with the harassment because she loved her work and excelled at it. But her true calling was riding motorcycles. She learned to ride on the sloping streets of San Francisco, where she spent a year living in 1981 after a bad breakup. Yet this was another activity, she said, that she took flak for from men.\n\nIt took working twice as hard each day, she said, to earn the little respect she was given.\n\nWhile working at the Metropolitan Opera, she was told she should have been home making babies and that she was taking jobs away from deserving men.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Stewart attended New York University\u2019s graduate program for scenic design. Later, she became a member of the Stagehands union, and landed an apprenticeship in the prop shop of the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nStewart \u2014 a lesbian, motorcycle safety activist and feminist \u2014 is no stranger to gender-based harassment. At 17, she left a difficult home life on Long Island for the freedom of an apartment in the East Village.\n\nShe went on: \u201cI mean, my life hasn\u2019t been easy, but every single time I have an adverse experience, I feel like I\u2019ve been given all these tremendous tools to overcome it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear, I\u2019m the luckiest person on Earth,\u201d Cheryl Stewart, 56, said, while eating lunch at a table alongside the Red Hook waterfront, her motorcycle helmet resting at her feet.\n\n\u201cI am a Stonewall survivor only recently sharing memories of that night.\u201d Owen Levy, 72\n\nOn the night of June 28, 1969, Owen Levy was standing in front of the Stonewall Inn while gay men and a few drag queens danced inside.\n\nLevy, who was 22 at the time, liked the Stonewall Inn because at a time when most gay clubs, \u2014 or \u201cwrinkle rooms,\u201d as he liked to call them \u2014 had a customer base of older gentleman, the Stonewall Inn had a younger crowd and a good jukebox.\n\nThat night, he was waiting outside for his friend, Robin. The two planned on meeting up and dancing for a bit.\n\nRobin arrived at almost the exact same time as the police.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go across the street,\u201d Levy recalled saying to Robin. The two men crossed the street and turned back to face the bar, not knowing that they would witness an event that 50 years later, would draw millions to New York City in commemoration.\n\nLevy has spent most of his career as an entertainment publicist, living in both New York City and Berlin, but now focuses on writing. He has published two books that discuss gay identity, including \u201cA Brother\u2019s Touch,\u201d which is set in the 1970s, in a post-Stonewall New York.\n\nHis novel, he said, draws from his own experiences at a time when most people did not speak openly about their sexuality, and treated being gay like a secret club.\n\n\u201cI realize that many younger people don\u2019t know how it was, but this was why the police could just walk into a gay bar like Stonewall and make people\u2019s lives difficult,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThe biggest fear a lot of these guys had was losing their job or getting their name in the papers by being busted in a gay bar.\u201d\n\nThe days that followed were more significant than the night itself, Levy said. He attended meetings in the first days of activism that followed Stonewall, mostly, he said, because Robin had a crush on a prominent organizer.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, if you could talk and you were relatively smart, you were a leader,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this movement needed at the time, a few people who were aggressive, willing and didn\u2019t feel that they were going to be punished for being gay.\u201d\n\nRobin died years later during the AIDS crisis, the second big war of their time, Levy said. The two men stayed close until his death.", "description": "New York has long been a haven for L.G.B.T.Q. people seeking acceptance and community.
