We hear her right after Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) says, \u201cThe Force will be with you.\u201d Leia\u2019s voice says softly, \u201cAlways.\u201d\n\nFisher, of course, died in 2016 after completing work on 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d Director JJ Abrams collected unused footage of Fisher from \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d (and \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d according to her brother Todd) in order to help bring Leia\u2019s story to a respectful end in \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe character of Leia is really, in a way, the heart of this story,\u201d Abrams said earlier this year during a panel at the Disney D-23 fan convention. \u201cWe realized we could not possibly tell the end of these nine films without Leia.\u201d\n\nLucasfilm\n\nHow Abrams and the visual effects gurus at Industrial Light & Magic pull that off remains to be seen, although the filmmakers have insisted they will not use a computer-generated Leia, akin to the one seen in 2016\u2019s \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story.\u201d (Fisher would have turned 63 on Monday.)\n\nWill Leia will appear as a Force Ghost alongside her twin brother Luke, who faded away after valiantly saving his sister and her friends at the end of \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d? The trailer keeps that a mystery.\n\nThe fate of C-3PO\n\nThe trailer also features a key moment with the golden protocol droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) as he\u2019s hooked up to some sort of wired contraption, pausing to tell Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) he\u2019s \u201ctaking one last look, sir, at my friends.\u201d\n\nThe sequence sure feels like and end. But hopefully this is just Threepio being paranoid Threepio, and Abrams being Abrams, teasing us about the fate of the universally beloved droid who spoke the very first line in 1977\u2019s \u201cStar Wars.\u201d\n\nSo 3P0 is saying goodbye cause he thinks is about to die but lets be honest 3P0 ALWAYS thinks he is about to die \u2014 That Junkman (@ThatJunkman) October 22, 2019\n\nReturn of the Emperor\n\nThe trailer revealed more about something that was teased at the Star Wars Celebration Chicago fan convention earlier this year: Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is back in a big way. Last seen when Darth Vader supposedly tossed him to a long, fiery death in 1983\u2019s \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d here the Emperor appears mostly in voiceover, but we do see what appears to be his new throne.\n\n\u201cLong have I waited,\u201d the Emperor\u2019s voice growls over shots that include heroes Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca and C-3PO in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. \u201cAnd now, your coming together is your undoing.\u201d\n\nOne brief shot appears to show the Emperor above Rey as the two come face to face. We also get a brief scene with Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) standing in what appears to be the ruins of the Emperor\u2019s throne room from the Death Star in \u201cReturn of the Jedi.\u201d\n\nThe Emperor's Throne Room\n\n\n\n1983 \u27a1 2019 pic.twitter.com/6YsJZEj6IV \u2014 Culture Crave \ud83c\udfa5 (@CultureCrave) October 22, 2019\n\nSpace horses running in space\n\nThere\u2019s a glimpse at an unusual scene featuring Finn (John Boyega) and a new character, Jannah, (Naomi Ackie) riding space horses (called \u201corbacks\u201d) on what appears to be the surface of a Star Destroyer floating in space, as BB-8 rolls alongside during a pitched battle. Star Wars has never been one for accurate physics, but how this one gets explained will be fascinating.\n\n\"and what comes through? that's right, it's the heroes riding their SPACE HORSES on the side of a STAR DESTROYER in the midst of an all-out dogfight\" pic.twitter.com/5r0sDTuVaD \u2014 Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) October 22, 2019\n\nLots of wars in the stars\n\nFans are really geeking out at a two-second shot of the Falcon backed by what looks like hundreds of starships from across Star Wars lore, including the Ghost from the \u201cRebels\u201d animated series (also seen in \u201cRogue One\u201d) and the Razorcrest from the upcoming Disney+ live action show \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d Will we get to see the characters behind the controls of these ships? Or will they remain safely anonymous, as Obi Wan says?\n\nPink = Starfortress bomber\n\nBrown = Han's freighter from TFA\n\nLight Green = Ship from the Mandalorian\n\nDark Red = U-wing pic.twitter.com/rSmPwWey5I \u2014 AdmiralNick22 (Aftab Ackbar Fan Account) (@AdmiralNick22) October 21, 2019\n\nRey and Kylo Ren again face off in a clash of lightsabers and complicated emotions. (\u201cPeople keep telling me they know me. No one does,\u201d Rey says. To which Kylo answers: \u201cBut I do.\u201d)\n\nDo they stay enemies? Or team up? Does their relationship go further, as \u201cReylo\u201d fans hope? Hard to tell. Always in motion is the future. But one intriguing shot seems to have Rey and Kylo working together to destroy an object that might include Darth Vader\u2019s helmet.\n\nLOOK AT THIS THING THAT THEY PUT IN THE TRAILER LOOK AT IT LOOK pic.twitter.com/8FRBJn2CnO \u2014 ever so ali (@EverSoReylo) October 22, 2019\n\nThe trailer offers little in the way of major plot points or spoilers, which is perfect for superfans like Dan Zehr.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad, because I get to be fully surprised by going to the movie theater,\u201d said Zehr, a teacher and writer who runs the Coffee With Kenobi podcast network.\n\n\u201cMy ears were tingling, I was on full-on adrenaline,\u201d Zehr said. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Man, nothing makes me feel this way, and this is the last time it\u2019s going to happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohn Hoey, a senior writer at Star Wars News Net and co-host of The Resistance Broadcast, says the trailer delivers epic visuals, from Rey leaping across forest canyons to lightsaber battles surrounded by a raging ocean, to space battles involving thousands of ships.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the biggest Star Wars movie in terms of scale and grandeur that I could ever have imagined,\u201d Hoey said.\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker hits theaters Dec. 20.\n\nStar Wars, Lucasfilm and ABC News are owned by parent company Disney.", "description": "Its taken less than twelve parsecs, but fans dissecting the final trailer for \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d are already blowing up the internet with reactions.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-disney-ht-jc-190507_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
