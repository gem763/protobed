Square is hiring 3-4 crypto engineers and 1 designer to work full-time on open source contributions to the bitcoin/crypto ecosystem. Work from anywhere, report directly to me, and we can even pay you in bitcoin! Introducing @SqCrypto. Why? \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) March 20, 2019\n\nDorsey became Bitcoin\u2019s unlikely hero after he was featured in Joe Rogan\u2018s podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, earlier this year.\n\nSpeaking to Rogan at the time, he said: \u201cI believe the internet will have a native currency [\u2026] I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Bitcoin, [but] I think it will be given all the tests it\u2019s been through, the principles behind it, and how it was created.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin] is something that was born on the internet, that was developed on the internet, that was tested on the internet,\u201d he continued, \u201cit is of the internet.\u201d\n\nAnd just like that, Dorsey became the talk of blockchain town \u2014 something unsurprising in itself given that staunch cryptocurrency supporters are desperate for the technology to gain recognition as it continues its quest to mainstream adoption.\n\nDorsey has long touted Bitcoin as the future of money and it seems he\u2019s putting his money where his mouth is \u2014 at least for now.", "description": "Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who recently said his company would never get involved with Facebook's Libra, has backed a cryptocurrency startup.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design-33.jpg&signature=6ea364fbc44a7626070abab0303e14a7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
