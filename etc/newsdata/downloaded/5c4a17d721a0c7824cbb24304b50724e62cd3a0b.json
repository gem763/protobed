USA TODAY\n\nRyan Reynolds just got out-trolled on his own birthday.\n\nSalma Hayek celebrated the actor's 42nd birthday Wednesday with a less than flattering photo of her \"Hitman's Bodyguard\" co-star, while she looked, well, perfect.\n\n\"Yes, Ryan, I am using your birthday to post this picture where I don\u2019t look so bad, while you look all beat up,\" she captioned an Instagram photo of herself holding a bottle of Aviation American Gin next to an unprepared Reynolds.\n\nHayek, 53, also took the opportunity to steal the spotlight by reminding Reynolds of an unfulfilled promise he made to her on her birthday on Sept. 2.\n\nCheers: Ryan Reynolds hilariously trolls his gin company in Amazon review\n\n\"You were gonna send me some Aviation gin for MY birthday AND THAT WAS ALMOST TWO MONTHS AGO,\" she said, referring to the American spirit company Reynolds bought in 2018.\n\nMore:Ryan Reynolds' NSFW response to Kate Beckinsale, who believes they 'look exactly' alike\n\nShe added, \"Oh and Happy Birthday by the way.\"\n\nThe birthday trolling didn't stop there.\n\nAn Instagram Story posted by Salma Hayek of her \"Hitman's Bodyguard\" co-stars Samuel L. Jackson and a partial Ryan Reynolds. (Photo: Salma Hayek's Instagram Story)\n\nHayek took a page out of Reynolds' cropping playbook and nearly cropped his face out of several pictures of herself, Reynolds and fellow \"Hitman's Bodyguard\" co-star Samuel L. Jackson on her Instagram Story.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to one of my dear friends Ryan Reynolds. Love sharing the screen with you,\" she captioned the series of hilariously trimmed pictures.\n\nReynolds pulled a similar move in August 2017 while wishing wife Blake Lively a happy birthday. His wife returned the favor Wednesday.\n\n\"I picked a good one. Happy birthday @vancityreynolds,\" Lively captioned a playful picture of her literally picking Reynolds' nose.\n\nNow we are just waiting on Reynolds, the master-troller himself, to enact revenge on Hayek and Lively.\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/23/ryan-reynolds-salma-hayek-trolls-birthday-boy-beat-up-photo/4076748002/", "description": "Checkmate!
