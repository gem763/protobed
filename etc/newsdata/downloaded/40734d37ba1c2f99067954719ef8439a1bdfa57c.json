That would extend import taxes to virtually everything China ships to the United States. China has hit back by targeting about $120 billion in U.S. goods, focusing on farm products.\n\nThe high cost of the tariffs and uncertainty over when and how the trade war will end have taken an economic toll, especially on manufacturing companies. A private survey last week found that U.S. factory output had dropped to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was in the grips of a deep recession.\n\nLiu met Thursday with leaders of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-China Business Council. Liu told them the Chinese negotiators \"come with great sincerity\" and were ready to discuss the trade balance, market access and investor protection, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nThe report made no mention of willingness to discuss Chinese industrial and technology policy, a major irritant that sparked the tariff war.\n\nThere are hopes a productive meeting would persuade the Trump administration to call off or postpone plans next Tuesday to raise tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports from 25 percent to 30 percent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nStill, Beijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy Washington. Doing so likely would require scaling back the Chinese leaders' aspirations to technological competitiveness they see as crucial to their country's future prosperity.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.", "description": "President Trump will meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday.", "authors": ["Ken Martin"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/Robert-Lighthizer-Steven-Mnuchin-Liu-He-ap1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
