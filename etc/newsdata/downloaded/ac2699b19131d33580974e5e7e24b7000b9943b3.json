Sorry it took so long,\u201d independent legislator Alex Greenwich, one of the sponsors of the bill, wrote in a tweet.\n\nThe new law allows terminations for women who are up to 22 weeks pregnant. Beyond 22 weeks, two doctors need to approve an abortion and they also need to seek advice from a hospital advisory committee.\n\nPreviously, doctors could perform abortions only if they believed continuing the pregnancy would do serious harm to the woman\u2019s health.\n\nSouth Australia is now the only state to criminalise abortion.\n\nThe legislation introduced by independent lawmakers had split the ruling centre-right state government and threatened the leadership of New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian.\n\nThe rift was healed after conservative legislators secured support to amend the bill to require a hospital committee to advise on abortions after 22 weeks.\n\nNevertheless, the new law threatened to erode support from religious voters, a key electoral block for Berejiklian\u2019s government.\n\nAnthony Fisher, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, said the vote was a \u201cdark day\u201d for the state.\n\nHe said in a statement it \u201cmay be the worst law passed in New South Wales in modern times, because it represents such a dramatic abdication of responsibility to protect the most vulnerable members of our community.\u201d", "description": "Legislators in Australia's most populous state voted on Thursday to decriminalise abortion after a fractious debate that threatened to divide the conservative government of New South Wales.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
