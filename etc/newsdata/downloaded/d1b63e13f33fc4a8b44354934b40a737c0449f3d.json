Food security is achieved when three objectives are met: when food is available, accessible in the right quantities and at the appropriate nutritional levels for all citizens at all times. In 2018, South Africa was ranked 45th most food-secure country out of 133 countries measured in The Economist Global Food Security Index. 2 This was relatively good, compared to other BRICS countries. For example, although South Africa\u2019s average income was 25 spots behind Russia, 23 behind China and 19 behind Brazil, the county\u2019s food security status was a relatively closer match-up, ranking just six spots behind Brazil, three spots behind Russia and one spot ahead of China (Table 1). Table 1:\n\nFood Security Index and GNI Ranking Source: World Bank, The Economist\n\nWhat is worth reiterating is the fact that despite South Africa\u2019s relatively lower average income, the country still manages to punch above its weight in terms of food security. This is a testament to the country\u2019s competitive agricultural sector, and its ability to supply food at a relatively low cost.\n\nAlthough the Food Security Index indicates South Africa is food-secure, there are pockets of food insecurity within the country when you consider a household-level perspective. This speaks to the general inequality in the country, where some households are food secure, and a sizable portion of other low-income households are not, primarily due to affordability. This scenario is more prevalent in Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.\n\nWhile there are a number of interventions that can assist in supporting households\u2019 access to nutritious food, one form of intervention that can boost rural households\u2019 income is through job creation in the agricultural sector. There is anecdotal evidence that in areas where government and private sector have collaborated in agricultural development, some level of success in terms of job creation could be achieved.\n\nWith agriculture having gained prominence as one of the sectors that could bring about rural economic development and job creation in South Africa, the government\u2019s approach to realising this vision should be regionally focused. Meaning, the aforementioned provinces should be the key priority in resource allocation, as the frontiers of agricultural expansion. Such an approach not only makes sense in terms of reducing poverty but also in exploiting the potential of underutilised land. Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape arguably have about 1.6 million to 1.8 million hectares of underutilised land which can be sustainably farmed for increased food security over the long term. This is according to a 2015 study by McKinsey Global Institute.\n\nAdmittedly, the current land governance system -- communal land -- has been cited as one of the hindrances in agricultural development in these provinces, as it limits investment. But, solving such matters can take a long time and land reform policy is still being debated across the country.\n\nThe near-term practical approach that can make a difference is structuring an innovative agricultural finance instrument -- such as blended-finance -- which pulls in the capital and human capital from both private and public sectors. In parts of the Eastern Cape, agribusinesses such as The Co-op, are currently engaged in such arrangements with the provincial government and in areas where projects have been implemented there has been some level of success. 5 These are some of the approaches that are needed for boosting households\u2019 income so they can have access to nutritious foods in the near term, while broad development policies are yet to be operationalised or implemented.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Wandile Sihlobo covering: .
