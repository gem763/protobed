It has 18 unicycles, each costing 7,000 naira ($23) and requiring regular maintenance.\n\nPupils put on paid performances at events and carnivals and also impromptu shows at market venues when in need of urgent funds for costumes, unicycles and sometimes, food.\n\nThey take home money from their performances, Kuyoro said, and also show off their skills in Instagram posts, where the school's account has more than 16,000 followers.", "description": "In a driveway of a suburban Lagos house, 14-year-old Kehinde Oguntokun juggles colourful circus clubs as he swings around on a unicycle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/27/70/1000x563_cmsv2_0e32fdc7-1cc2-52f3-9034-9b795641153a-4242770.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
