Trump had suggested last week he would consider an interim agreement.\n\nU.S. stocks DJIA, -0.59% COMP, -0.80% SPX, -0.49% initially moved higher Friday but turned negative after a report that the Chinese delegation had canceled plans to visit farms in Montana as a part of its negotiations with the U.S.\n\nSee: Stocks end lower after trade concerns rattle markets.\n\nTrump trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network that \u201cthe big show is when Liu He, the chief negotiator for China, sits down with [U.S. Trade Representative] Bob Lighthizer sometime in the next couple weeks.\u201d\n\nIRAN SANCTIONS\n\nIn the Oval Office alongside Morrison, Trump called the Iran sanctions the highest ever imposed on a country. Trump had promised earlier in the week to impose new Iran sanctions in retaliation for Tehran\u2019s alleged role in strikes on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions cut off the last remaining source of funds for Iran.\n\nA U.S. Treasury statement said Iran\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund is also being sanctioned. The sanctions freeze any U.S.-based assets of the bank and fund, and prohibit Americans from dealing with either entity.\n\nThe U.S. already has numerous sanctions on Iran, having reimposed penalties that had been lifted as part of the Iranian nuclear deal. In May 2018 the Treasury sanctioned the then-governor of the central bank, but the sanctions didn\u2019t extend to the bank itself.\n\n\u2018DICEY\u2019 CONVERSATION, DENIED\n\nOn Twitter, Trump said Democrats and the media think he may have had a \u201cdicey\u201d conversation with a foreign leader.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments follow reports that the whistleblower complaint by an intelligence official centers on Ukraine. The Washington Post reported the complaint involved communications with a foreign leader and a \u201cpromise\u201d that Trump made. It was so alarming that a U.S. intelligence official who had worked at the White House went to the inspector general of the intelligence community, the Post said, citing two former U.S. officials.\n\nAsked in the Oval Office if he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in the conversation, Trump replied \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed,\u201d and said \u201csomeone ought to look into Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nNow see: Trump repeatedly pressed Ukrainian president to investigate Biden\u2019s son.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Friday said he didn\u2019t need a trade deal with China before the 2020 elections, as he rejected a partial agreement and said \u201cwe have...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR746_trump__ZG_20190920111057.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
