Yan Gomes has been Corbin\u2019s personal catcher all season. But Suzuki\u2019s availability for the rest of the series is in question.\n\n\u201cHe had an MRI this afternoon and I wait on the doctor to see what the results were,\u201d Washington manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cHe says he feels OK. But until we see those results, we\u2019ll know more after.\u201d\n\nSuzuki was pinch hit for in the sixth inning of Washington\u2019s 4-1 loss to Houston on Friday, which pulled the Astros to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.\n\nGomes is 2 for 10 with one RBI in the World Series.\n\nRaudy Reed and Tres Barrera are the other catchers on Washington\u2019s 40-man roster.\n\n\u201cObviously, we need a backup catcher,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIf he\u2019s not going to be able to play for a few days, we\u2019re going to have to do something else.\u201d\n\nNL Championship Series MVP Howie Kendrick was back in the Nationals\u2019 starting lineup at second base, a night after Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera was at second. Kendrick pinch hit and singled in the eighth inning of Game 3. The designated hitter in Houston, Kendrick has three errors in the postseason.\n\nShortstop Trea Turner led off, followed by right fielder Adam Eaton, third baseman Anthony Rendon, left fielder Juan Soto, Kendrick, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, center fielder Victor Robles, Gomes and left-hander Patrick Corbin.\n\nWith no DH, rookie Yordan \u00c1lvarez remained out of the Astros\u2019 starting lineup. George Springer moved from center field to right, Jake Marisnick started in center and Josh Reddick moved to the bench.\n\nSpringer led off, followed by second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve, left fielder Michael Brantley, third baseman Alex Bregman, first baseman Yuli Gurriel, shortstop Carlos Correa, , catcher Robinson Chirinos, Marisnick and pitcher Jos\u00e9 Urquidy.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki was out of the starting lineup for Game 4 of the World Series on Saturday night after injuring his right", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/26/59ce52_world-series-astros-nationals-baseball-24747-houston-astros-carlos-correa-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
