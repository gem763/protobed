Wegmans ice creams contain flavors derived from non-vanilla sources, which is misleading to consumers, the lawsuit states.\n\nWegmans doesn't see it that way.\n\n\"We take great pride in the quality of all of our Wegmans Brand products,\" said Jo Natale, vice president of media relations for Wegmans Food Markets. \"We believe that the labeling of our ice cream fully complies with all regulations and industry standards, and is not misleading in any way.\"\n\nIs your boss snooping?:Your employer is probably spying on your work phone or computer\n\nRetail news:Toys R Us making a comeback via archrival Target\n\nNot just plain vanilla\n\nWegmans is the latest target in a series of vanilla-related lawsuits filed by attorney Spencer Sheehan of Great Neck, Long Island.\n\n\u2022 In June, he was the lawyer for class-action lawsuits against Unilever United States Inc., which makes ice cream under the Breyers brand; for Danone North America, pertaining to vanilla yogurts including the Oikos Triple Zero line; and Nestl\u00e9 Dreyer\u2019s Ice Cream Co., which makes Dreyer's and Edy's ice cream brands.\n\n\u2022 In July, he was the lawyer for a class-action lawsuit against Friendly\u2019s Manufacturing and Retail for ice creams with the Friendly\u2019s brand.\n\n\u2022 Other targets of similar lawsuits include Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Cumberland Farms and Blue Diamond Growers of Sacramento, California, maker of vanilla-flavored Almond Breeze almond milk, according to an article in the Boston Business Journal.\n\n\u201cClass action cases provide a valuable mechanism that Americans have to address certain wrongs,\" Sheehan said. \"This is a valid and lawful means for doing so.\u201d", "description": "Wegmans is the latest to face a federal lawsuit over vanilla ice cream.
