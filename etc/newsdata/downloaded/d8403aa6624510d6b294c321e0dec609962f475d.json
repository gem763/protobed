(Tom McCorkle For The Washington Post/Food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist, Food\n\nIt\u2019s time to set the record straight on processed food. If you come here often, you know I think it bears the lion\u2019s share of the blame for obesity and its attendant diseases, because processing \u2014 and only processing \u2014 enables the cheap, nutrient-challenged, ubiquitous foods that are specifically designed to be overeaten.\n\nBut \u201cit\u2019s processed\u201d isn\u2019t a reasonable objection to any particular food. It depends on how it\u2019s processed.\n\nProcessing is a tool, and, like any tool, it can be used for good or for evil. If I have a hammer, I can use it to fix my neighbor\u2019s roof. Or I can kill his dog. Likewise food processing. (Also genetic modification, in case I don\u2019t have a big enough fight on my hands already.)\n\n[How processed food makes us fat]\n\nWhen processing is used, for example, to extend shelf life, add nutrition or kill pathogens, that\u2019s all good. Also when plants are processed into convincing meat substitutes, decreasing (eventually) our beef consumption and the carbon that goes with it. Planty burgers aren\u2019t significantly better for you than beef, but their processed-ness has nothing to do with it.\n\nI am fully persuaded that the best way to eat a healthful diet is to cook with whole or whole-ish ingredients. But I am also fully persuaded that we\u2019re not going back to a world where that\u2019s the norm. For too many people, too much of the time, cooking is a chore.\n\nIf you walk through a supermarket, you\u2019ll find plenty of those cheap, nutrient-challenged, processed foods designed to be irresistible. But you\u2019ll also find processed foods that are convenient, reasonably nutritious stand-ins.\n\nTo find them, I took Alice H. Lichtenstein shopping. She\u2019s a professor at Tufts University who could fairly be called a grande dame of nutrition, one of the most influential voices in the field. We went to two markets: a Stop & Shop (the Massachusetts equivalent of D.C.\u2019s Giant supermarkets) and a Trader Joe\u2019s.\n\n[One thing might keep the Impossible Burger from saving the planet: Steak]\n\nMost of our picks are veg- and grain-heavy. This isn\u2019t because meat is bad; it\u2019s because meat doesn\u2019t lend itself to shelf-stable products as easily as, say, lentils. By all means, add shrimp or chicken or eggs or beef (or planty burger) to some of these to turn them into a meal.\n\nI\u2019m also not considering flavor. People\u2019s tastes are too personal for that. I\u2019m also not dealing with environmental impact or animal welfare, although I think those are hugely important and I\u2019ve written about them .\n\nWe didn\u2019t go in with hard-and-fast criteria, but we did look for high fiber content (it\u2019s an indication of high veg content) and ingredient lists that begin with good things. Sodium content came up over and over; it tends to be high. Still, we found some decent picks.\n\nCereals\n\nLook for the ones with whole grains at the top of the ingredient list, plenty of fiber and no more than a couple of grams of sugar per serving. It\u2019s also useful to know the difference between granola (which is baked, usually with added fat and sugar) and muesli (unbaked, usually without added fat and sugar). If your choices are limited, default to Cheerios. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s the top-selling cereal in the country. It\u2019s mostly oats, with very little sodium (140 milligrams) and only one gram of sugar per 100-calorie, one-cup serving. But don\u2019t get fooled by the brand extensions. The No. 2 U.S. cereal is Honey Nut Cheerios, and it\u2019s got more calories, less fiber (2 grams) and much more sugar (9 grams). Okay, the \u201choney\u201d is right there in the name, so you expect more sugar, but you also get more in Multi Grain Cheerios, and every other Cheerios version out there. Default to the original.\n\nRotisserie chicken\n\nRotisserie chicken falls into a ready-to-eat category that doesn\u2019t require a nutrition facts panel, but the ingredients are on the label, so you can see whether the seasoning includes salt and sugar (it often does). But it\u2019s an inexpensive, wildly popular, low-effort main dish.\n\n[Here\u2019s what the government\u2019s dietary guidelines should really say]\n\nSauces\n\nThere\u2019s marinara, which, on a whole-grain pasta, is a perfectly fine meal. The big problem with jarred red sauce is sodium; the lowest level we found was in Cucina Antica Tomato Basil, with 220 milligrams in a half-cup serving. By contrast, Prego\u2019s low-sodium version of its traditional sauce had 360 milligrams. (If you\u2019re not worried about sodium, you have many more options.) But there are other choices in other aisles, such as Patak\u2019s Simmer Sauces. They\u2019re basically curry bases, and they come in several flavors (butter chicken, rogan josh, korma, mango and others) and various heat levels. The main ingredients (after water) are onion and tomato, and they\u2019ve all got a long list of spices. They\u2019re not super nutritious (and they, too, have a fair amount of salt), but they\u2019re a way to turn things that are super nutritious (like plain old vegetables) into a meal. Add some of that rotisserie chicken, and dinner\u2019s on the table.\n\n\n\nA Birds Eye\u2019s Steamfresh frozen protein bowl, Southwest style. (Tom McCorkle For The Washington Post/Food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nFrozen vegetables\n\nIf I haven\u2019t already persuaded you of the many fine qualities of frozen vegetables (convenience, cost, less food waste than fresh), I\u2019ll take another shot at it. If you have some kind of frozen green (kale, collards, spinach), you can use it to bulk up a premade pasta sauce or soup. Some vegetables don\u2019t freeze well (peppers and onions, for example), but many \u2014 such as peas and corn \u2014 are just fine. And fast. And cheap.\n\nThe frozen veg aisle also has some of most nutritious ready-to-cook dishes in the store. Birds Eye\u2019s Steamfresh brand has mixes that include legumes and grains, and a sauce, all in one microwaveable bag. Green Giant sells its version as protein bowls. Alexia sells several kinds of side dishes based on riced squash or cauliflower.\n\nSoups\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for bona fide nutrition, soups are your friend. While many vegetables don\u2019t fare well in food processing, legumes do. Beans, split peas, lentils and chickpeas are all soupable. You can get soups fresh, frozen, in shelf-stable cartons and just-add-water cups. Check out Tabatchnick soups, which are genuinely nutritious, come in low-sodium varieties, and are made by a 100-year-old, family-owned company.\n\nBowls\n\nBowls are typically a combination of grains, vegetables and often meat. Wildscape, a brand carried in Stop & Shop\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d section, sells frozen bowls, with all the above, in appetizing combinations. The cilantro-lime chicken with charred corn salsa, red rice, black beans, riced cauliflower and avocado mojo verde has a substantial 11 grams of fiber and an ingredient list of things I certainly want to eat. The bowls are, however, expensive at $5.99, a bit high in sodium (700 milligrams in the cilantro-lime chicken) and only enough for a light lunch (they run 330 to 450 calories). Annie Chun\u2019s, a brand in the international aisle, has a Thai-style green curry with brown rice and red quinoa that\u2019s got a bit less sodium (660 milligrams), less fiber (7 grams) and a slightly lower price tag ($4.69). Bowls vary a lot, so read labels.\n\n[As the Impossible and Beyond burgers take off, will real veggie burgers go extinct?]\n\nRice mixes\n\nBefore there were bowls, there were rice mixes, and the rice section has options. For starters, if you\u2019re in the habit of sneering at Minute Rice, stop. It\u2019s just parboiled; they do some of the cooking so you do less of it. With brown rice, that\u2019s the difference between 40 minutes and 10. But beyond plain rice, there are blends with other grains and legumes. Minute\u2019s Multi-Grain Medley has quinoa, flaxseed and chia mixed in, with 8 grams of fiber per serving. Also in that aisle is Tasty Bite\u2019s Brown Rice & Lentils, which is exactly what the label says, and it doesn\u2019t even require cooking (just warming in the microwave). You could even add frozen kale and rotisserie chicken.\n\nTrader Joe's products\n\nThe market is a good source for reasonably healthful processed foods. In the refrigerated section, we found a lentil soup with ancient grains, a poke bowl and stuffed peppers. In the freezer, there was a riced cauliflower bowl, a shakshuka starter and vegetable burritos. Sodium levels are generally reasonable, as are prices.\n\nAfter our shopping trips, Lichtenstein\u2019s verdict was \u201cI\u2019m not impressed,\u201d she said in an email. If this is what you eat every day, your diet is \u201cboring and limited.\u201d\n\nHer advice: \u201cKeep shelf-stable (e.g., canned bean, canned tuna, pouches of brown rice, pasta), refrigerator-stable (e.g., salad dressing, sauces, cheese), and freezer-stable (e.g., precooked chicken strips, veggie burgers, frozen veggies) options.\u201d That way, you can combine them into meals in a microwave or single pan on the stove.\n\nI\u2019m a little more optimistic. There were some interesting choices, but we definitely need more of them. We\u2019ll only get them, though, if there\u2019s demand. As always, we get the food system we demand.", "description": "UNEARTHED | Her list includes rotisserie chicken, rice mixes and frozen vegetables.", "authors": ["Tamar Haspel", "Columnist", "September At Pm", "Tamar Haspel Writes Unearthed", "A Monthly Commentary In Pursuit Of A More Constructive Conversation On Divisive Food-Policy Issues.
