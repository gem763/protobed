Jimmy Gomez told POLITICO. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo agriculture Democrats vow trade deal talks will continue despite impeachment push\n\nDemocrats working with the Trump administration to try to pass a new North American trade agreement say they are unbowed in their efforts to try to get a deal done this year, even as the House dives into an impeachment inquiry.\n\nJust hours after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would launch a formal impeachment inquiry on President Donald Trump, the Democratic Caucus met Wednesday morning in part to get an update on the continuing U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement negotiations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who leads the nine-member working group negotiating changes to the deal with the Trump administration, said he had one message for the caucus at the meeting: \u201cProceed with optimism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no reason, based on what happened yesterday, to think that there\u2019s any deterrents that will hold us back,\u201d Neal told reporters afterward.\n\nHouse Democrats have been working closely for months with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to negotiate changes to Trump\u2019s signature deal to replace NAFTA. They have outlined four main areas where they are seeking stronger language: labor, environment, access to medicines and enforcement.\n\nDespite several weeks of near-constant engagement, a broad majority of the caucus remains unsatisfied with the current text of the deal in those and other areas.\n\nAnd Democratic congressional aides say Pelosi will not call the deal up for a vote unless or until a substantial portion of the caucus is on board. She has held firm even as some more moderate Democrats and those in more trade-dependent districts have begun to indicate their support for the agreement. Business groups, farmers and Republicans alike are also growing more restless to see it in place to help benefit the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Trump administration, which is pushing to get the deal passed before the end of the year, sent counterproposals to Capitol Hill earlier this month in an attempt to meet Democrats\u2019 top concerns. But the offer fell short and amounted to \u201can incomplete response,\u201d Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who sits on the Ways and Means Committee, told POLITICO on Wednesday.\n\nStill, the resounding outlook from Democrats on Wednesday was that the back-and-forth will continue as planned even as the impeachment inquiry continues. Although some members acknowledged the probe will affect everything that happens in the House, several others emphasized that the two issues can advance simultaneously.\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\n\u201cWe can do more than one thing at a time,\u201d said Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.), a member of the working group.\n\nRep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), another of the group\u2019s members, went a step further, suggesting the inquiry could be beneficial for trade talks because it means the White House will be more willing to strike a compromise to get USMCA approved.\n\n\u201cSometimes when there\u2019s a crisis, there\u2019s more opportunity,\u201d Gomez told POLITICO.\n\nFor now, the plan remains for working group members to send another counterproposal back to the Trump administration by the end of the week. Members said the U.S. trade office also appears committed to continuing negotiations as usual.\n\n\u201cNot sure about the White House, but at least USTR\u2019s office is interested in engaging still,\u201d said Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.).\n\nBut the administration is posturing that legislative business will be hampered by the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether or not they\u2019re going to have time to do any deals,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon when asked about the prospects for USMCA, after he signed a mini-agreement with Japan in New York City. \u201cAll they\u2019re talking about is nonsense.\u201c\n\nHe then turned to Lighthizer to ask for his perspective. \u201cI think it will come up to a vote,\u201d Lighthizer replied. \u201cWhen it comes up for a vote, I\u2019m confident it will pass.\u201c\n\nOn Tuesday evening, White House press secretary said that by moving forward with impeachment, House Democrats have \u201cdestroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks.\u201d\n\nThe statement made no direct reference to USMCA, however, which has long been the Trump administration\u2019s top legislative priority.\n\nNeal shrugged off the threat on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAny threat to shut down the work of the legislative branch would be a violation of the separation of powers,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said. \u201cI intend fully for Ways and Means responsibilities to proceed.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats, too, appeared unfazed by the White House\u2019s threat.\n\n\u201cFiguring out what\u2019s in [Trump\u2019s] head and trying to act upon that is a futile exercise,\u201d said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.). \u201cWe just have to keep our heads down and keep doing our work.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under: Agriculture", "description": "House lawmakers say the new inquiry will not affect ongoing trade negotiations with the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Megan Cassella", "Sabrina Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/46/ee/a6bcc7874148b4cfa97d5524a318/19925-gomez-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
