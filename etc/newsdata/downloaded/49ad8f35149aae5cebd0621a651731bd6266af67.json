The 16-14 victory on the road didn\u2019t exactly exorcise the demons of last year\u2019s heartbreaking playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles that saw Cody Parkey\u2019s would-be game winner bounce off the left upright and crossbar.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut it certainly helps.\n\n\n\n\n\nChaos, controversy in game\u2019s final moments\n\nPineiro\u2019s kick capped a chaotic sequence in the final moments of Sunday\u2019s game that saw the Broncos take the lead on a gusty two-point conversion along with multiple miscues, penalties and controversial calls.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went down.\n\nTrailing 13-6 with 31 seconds remaining, Broncos quarterback Joe Flacco lofted a beauty of a pass over the head of Bears cornerback Kyle Fuller into the outstretched hands of Emmanuel Sanders who snagged the ball and landed in bounds in the back right corner of the end zone for a seven-yard touchdown.\n\nBroncos gamble, screw up, gamble again\n\nFaced with a chance to play for overtime or take the lead in the game\u2019s final minutes, Broncos head coach Vic Fangio chose to roll the dice. Flacco led the Broncos offense on to the field for the go-ahead two-point conversion.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t get the play off on time. The play clock ran out, and the Broncos were flagged for a five-yard delay-of-game penalty.\n\nWith the ball now at the 7-yard line instead of the 2, Denver opted then to kick an extra point. Except veteran kicker Brandon McManus missed.\n\nThe sixth-year Broncos kicker pushed the extra point wide right, and the Bears had the ball and a 13-12 lead with 31 seconds remaining \u2014 or so it appeared.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the Bears sideline celebrated, officials announced that Chicago cornerback Buster Skrine was offside on the play.\n\nThe Broncos had another chance at the 2-yard line. And they reverted to their original plan of going for two.\n\nJubilation at Mile High\n\nFlacco once again found Sanders \u2014 this time streaking across the front of the end zone \u2014 to convert the two-point conversion and take a 14-13 lead. The Broncos and fans at Mile High celebrated what seemed a sure victory.\n\nBut the chaos was just beginning.\n\nLast chance for Bears\n\nEddy Pineiro stunned the Broncos with a 53-yard field goal to cap a wild day in Denver. (AP)\n\nThe Bears started their final possession on the 25-yard line with 31 seconds remaining after a touchback.\n\nBears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky found Trey Burton in the flat for a short gain on first down that didn\u2019t add much to Chicago\u2019s chances of winning. But there was a flag on the play.\n\nControversial roughing call\n\nBroncos defensive end Bradley Chubb was flagged for roughing the passer on a call that was far from clear cut. Chubb hit Trubisky as soon as he released the ball. He landed on Trubisky with his body weight, which appeared to be the impetus for the controversial call.\n\nRoughing the passer on #Broncos\u2019 Bradley Chubb.

Robinson fell to the turf, and the clock read zero. Denver appeared to have won the game.\n\nBut the officials came out once again and signaled that there was time left. Trubisky had signaled for a timeout as soon as Robinson hit the ground.\n\nAfter huddling, officials determined that he called the timeout with one second remaining, giving the Bears one last chance to win the game.\n\nPineiro the hero\n\nThey then put that chance on the right foot of Pineiro, who pointed to the sky, lined up the kick and pushed the ball through uprights in the thin Denver air as time ran out, crushing the hopes of a just-jubilant Denver crowd while sending his teammates onto the field in celebration.\n\nThere was no flag this time. Game over. Bears win.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t how they drew it up. It came on the heels of a second straight ugly game from their offense that saw Trubisky average 4.4 yards per attempt en route to 120 passing yards.\n\nBut it was a much-needed, dramatic victory to avoid digging an 0-2 hole to start the season.\n\nAnd for the first time in a long time, it gave the Bears faith in their kicker.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Eddy Pineiro stunned the Broncos with a 53-yard field goal to cap a wild day in Denver.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HQmzcgayO5eAZ4LA6td0Cg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xzrL60RwiARQVA5CzkGSVA--~B/aD0yODc5O3c9NDMxOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/dea4fc80-d818-11e9-bedd-f7e480f9fc35", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
