That agreement, with publisher Hachette Book Group, was for a puff-piece detailing his long relationship as Trump\u2019s go-to guy and personal attorney. Hachette pulled the deal and the estimated $500,000-plus advance amid Cohen\u2019s legal troubles last year, as reported by FOX Business.\n\nBut now that he\u2019s in prison, and thinking about life post-jail, Cohen, 53, has told people writing a book on Trump is at the top of his agenda when he\u2019s a free man. And the new effort will take a decidedly different tone, reflecting the soured relationship between Cohen and Trump that began soon after federal agents raided his office and home in the spring of 2018. The federal raid eventually led to his guilty plea for various crimes, his prison time and of course, his about-face on Trump.\n\nThe book, these people say, will likely include details that Cohen was not prepared to divulge during his first book project. Those may include his handling of thorny legal issues involving Trump, his browbeating of reporters who were investigating the former real estate man\u2019s business dealings, as well as his work to keep alleged Trump paramours silent. Cohen may also disclose embarrassing details about Trump\u2019s business activities that he was privy to during their association, these people add.\n\n\u201cMichael is telling people he really wants to write an honest account of his relationship with Trump,\u201d a friend of Cohen told FOX Business. \u201cThe question is whether he can find a publisher.\u201d\n\nLanny Davis, Cohen\u2019s lawyer, declined comment on the matter but would not deny Cohen\u2019s book-writing aspirations or that the book would highlight Cohen\u2019s anger with the President.\n\nBooks about the Trump presidency have been big sellers, especially insider accounts from former aides and associates.\n\nBy that logic, Cohen\u2019s account could be a blockbuster. During his first foray into book writing, Cohen made his pitch mainly to conservative imprints at major publishing houses, but some passed because Cohen \u2013 then still Trump\u2019s personal lawyer\u2014wouldn\u2019t provide juicy details of his dealings with the president that were covered by attorney-client confidentiality.\n\nNow that Cohen\u2019s relationship with Trump is frayed and he is willing to divulge dirt, he can pitch his book to a wider array of publishing houses. He\u2019s also much less worried about the legal ramifications of sharing his history with Trump and has every incentive to provide a tell-all account of his days as a fixer for his old boss, people who know Cohen tell FOX Business.\n\nEarlier in the year, Cohen appeared before the House Intelligence Committee to provide a testimony of his work for Trump. During those hearings, Cohen said he intended to pursue another book deal, and hinted at some of the information about Trump\u2019s business practices that might be part of the tome, including the payments to alleged girlfriends, Trump\u2019s business activities in Russia and how the president, when he was a private businessman, allegedly manipulated his actual net worth to avoid paying taxes.\n\n\u201cIt was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in Forbes and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes,\u201d he said.\n\nCohen said during the hearings that he knew more about alleged abuses involving Trump but couldn\u2019t reveal details because they were being investigated by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nBut Cohen\u2019s rapid and stark reversal on Trump could also hurt any book\u2019s credibility. Publishers may shy away from a deal or they might balk at a significant advance of hundreds of thousands of dollars, along the lines of what Hachette previous agreed to. Hachette did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDuring his long years as Trump\u2019s lawyer, there seemed to be no task that Cohen wouldn\u2019t pursue on the part of Trump. He would call Trump \u201cboss,\u201d and openly boast about his close relationship with the president that brought him a number of lucrative consulting contracts.\n\nBut as his legal issues began to mount, those contracts dried up, his business dealings faltered, including the book deal and that\u2019s when he became a staunch Trump critic. At one point, Davis, his attorney, said: \u201cI know that Mr. Cohen would never accept a pardon from a man that he considers to be both corrupt and a dangerous person in the Oval Office. And [Cohen] has flatly authorized me to say under no circumstances would he accept a pardon from Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump insiders have said that Cohen was seeking attention by attacking the president, and they will certainly attack his credibility if a negative account was published.\n\nFriends of Cohen say he has plenty of inside dirt on the president that could make for compelling reading. They also say Cohen\u2019s friendship with Trump was mostly a matter of convenience and that privately their relationship was fraught. Trump would openly belittle Cohen and Cohen would privately complain that he loathed Trump even as he was eager to carry out his wishes. And those details will be pitched to publishers if and when it\u2019s feasible, these people add.", "description": "Mum is not the word for Michael Cohen.
