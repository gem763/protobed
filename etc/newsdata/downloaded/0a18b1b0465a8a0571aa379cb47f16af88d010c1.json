The educator in turn used Piglet's journey to teach students about the importance of a positive mindset and a reminder to never give up.\n\n'She called it Piglet Mindset, and we corresponded throughout the year. At the end of the year, we surprised the kids.\n\n'They thought we were going to FaceTime, and we walked in with Piggy in his stroller and three of my other dogs, and everyone was crying,' Melissa said.\n\nOn a website for Piglet, Melissa also writes that she rescued his mother and three litter mates from the 'hoarding situation' she found them in.\n\nThe decision to adopt Piglet full time didn't come easy to Melissa - who has six other dogs.\n\n'It was quite a decision to make. He is a lot of work and he is like a full-time job, taking care of a little disabled baby. But he's so cute, and we couldn't give him away at that point.'\n\nFamous: Piglet, featured right in 2018, recently featured as a talent at Petcon in Los Angeles, left\n\nCutie: Over 120,000 people follow Piglet's journey online via Instagram\n\nBusy: Melissa Shapiro, pictured with Piglet, operates the Piglet's Mindset Outreach Program\n\nIn particular, it was a challenge to help Piglet overcome his anxiety.\n\n'He was so anxious, he was screaming constantly. He would play, then go to sleep, but when he wasn't doing either of those, he was screaming. I couldn't leave the house the first month I had the dog here,' Melissa recalled.\n\n'When we kept him, I said he needs to have some bigger meaning,' she added.\n\nThese days, meaning comes in the form of 120,000 engaged Instagram followers, championing Piglet's personal journey.\n\nMelissa created the official Piglet Mindset Outreach Program to teach children across the U.S. how to face challenges and be the best versions of themselves.\n\nSo far, classrooms in Alabama, Connecticut, Japan and Australia have downloaded the free program from the website.\n\n'Screaming baby': Melissa, left, said when he came to Connecticut as a 'screaming baby', right, Piglet kept her hands full\n\nMerch: A pup wears some merchandise from the Piglet's Mindset program\n\nThe star of the show: Piglet poses in front of a homemade poster featuring positive mindset slogans\n\nThe program, which consists of online learning materials, has spread to classrooms in Alabama, Connecticut and even Japan and Australia, and Shapiro offers it for free download on her website.\n\n'People are afraid to adopt these animals, they think that it's going to be too much work.\n\n'But people see Piglet's page and I get so many notes from people that because of him, they just adopted.\n\n'It's rewarding to know that people are taking the lead and being inspired by Piggy,' Melissa said.\n\nShe told the outlet that the money she earns from ads and the merchandise she sells goes to special-needs animal shelters.\n\nSince its inception, the Piglet Mindset Outreach Program has raised more than $30,000 for other animals in needs.", "description": "Piglet, a pink-hued two-and-a-half-year-old blind and deaf dachshund-Chihuahua mix is inspiring children (and adults) with his personal story since he was rescued from a hoarding situation", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/22/19272726-0-image-a-450_1570138400047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
