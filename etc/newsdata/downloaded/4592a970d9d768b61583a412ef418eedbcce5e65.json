Farrow reports Weinstein hired Black Cube\u2014an Israeli private-intelligence agency\u2014to spy on women who had accused Weinstein as well as reporters who were investigating the claims.\n\nFarrow writes that one Russian-American agent, Roman Khaykin, and one Ukrainian-American, Igor Ostrovskiy, were both private investigators who were hired by Black Cube as subcontractors. They were reportedly asked to surveil people on target lists provided to Black Cube by Weinstein and his lawyers. In the fall of 2017, the pair turned their attention to Farrow by staking out his apartment building and trailing him to his workplaces.\n\nKhaykin reportedly claimed to have used Farrow\u2019s cellphone to track his location, and is alleged to have sent multiple screenshots of maps with a location pin that showed where the journalist was. However, a Black Cube source insisted to Farrow that the agency was unaware of, and didn\u2019t authorize, any form of cellphone tracking against him.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jamie Ross", "Thedailybeast.Com Ronan-Farrow-Weinsteins-Spies-Hacked-My-Phoneone-Of-Them-Told-Me-So"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
