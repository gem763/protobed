She has been in detention in Tehran for a year.\n\nMoore-Gilbert's case was complex, Payne said.\n\n\"We are continuing our discussions with the Iranian government,\" she added. \"We don't accept the charges upon which she was convicted and we will seek to have her returned to Australia.\"\n\nIn September, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency quoted a judiciary spokesman as saying the three Australians had been detained for spying.\n\nFirkin and King said they would not comment further on their detention.\n\n\"We know there are others who remain in detention in Iran, including a fellow Australian, and believe intense media coverage may not be helpful for efforts to bring them home,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Lidia Kelly; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "description": "MELBOURNE/GENEVA (Reuters) - An Australian couple who spent more than three months in a prison in Tehran has been freed, Australia's foreign minister said on Saturday, and an Iranian news agency later reported that an Iranian student was released from detention in Australia.
