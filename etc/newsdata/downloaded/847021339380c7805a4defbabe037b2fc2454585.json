Suddenly, the three dogs came running from Forgotten Treasures Animal Rescue and proceeded to tear at her.\n\nThe dogs had escaped from a pen at the Forgotten Treasures Animal Rescue (pictured)\n\nThe victim was taken to a hospital to receive dozens of stitches. Investigators say she could have lasting nerve damage.\n\nThe sheriff said the owners of the shelter, which had only recently opened in Wanette, have been cooperative and provided deputies with records showing that all three dogs had rabies shots.\n\nThe shelter on Friday released a statement on its Facebook page, revealing that two of the canines involved in the attack were foster dogS, and the third was a volunteer's personal pet.\n\n'We at Forgotten Treasures are devastated that this happened. None of the dogs involved have ever shown signs of aggression, and the dogs broke out of their pen when no one was home,' the post read.\n\nAll three animals - two foster dogs an a volunteer's pet - will be euthanized after completing mandatory quarantine (not pictured)\n\nThe statement went on to say that all three dogs will be 'humanely euthanized' after completing mandatory quarantine.\n\n'Our prayers are with this child and her family. While we understand the outrage you are feeling, please refrain from placing blame,' the status update stated. 'To our knowledge, this child did nothing to provoke this attack. The rescue could not have reasonably foreseen the animals would escape or attack. It is a horrific tragedy. Please pray for all involved.\n\nThe sheriff intends to file charges in connection to the attack with the district attorney, who will decide whether to prosecute the case.", "description": "A nine-year-old girl got off her bike to pick up some rocks near her home in Wanette, Oklahoma, Tuesday when she was attacked by three dogs, suffering numerous bite marks and lacerations.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/21/19902030-0-image-a-105_1571430798150.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
