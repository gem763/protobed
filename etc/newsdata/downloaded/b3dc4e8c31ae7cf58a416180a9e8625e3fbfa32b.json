That result meant PNG, who topped their qualifying pool heading into the final day of group stage matches in the UAE, booked their place at October\u2019s tournament in Australia.\n\nAustralia thrash Sri Lanka by 134 runs in first Twenty20 international Read more\n\nVictory over Kenya did not come easy, and PNG made life tough for themselves by falling to a potentially disastrous 19-6 inside four overs. But Norman Vanua came to the crease and dug in for a 48-ball 54 to steady the ship and guide his team to 118 off 19.3 overs. In response, Kenya could make only 73 from 18.4 overs, as PNG captain Assad Vala took three wickets for just seven runs, and Nosaina Pokana 3-21.\n\nIn the later game, the Netherlands beat Scotland by four wickets, but failed to win inside 12.3 overs and as such could not topple PNG from top spot in the group on net run rate \u2013 nor snatch the one automatic World Cup qualification spot on offer.\n\nIt caps a roller-coaster few years for PNG, who lost their one-day international and T20I status with the ICC in March 2018, and did not reclaim them until April this year. Coach Joe Dawes, the former Queensland fast bowler, admitted his team was a \u201clittle emotional\u201d after qualification was confirmed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty big two years with what the boys have been through,\u201d Dawes said. \u201cFor them to achieve this is pretty special. The boys and PNG Cricket have had an interesting year and for them to achieve this is a great thing for us and for the nation, and for all the staff back at home who didn\u2019t make the trip.\n\n\u201cThe boys have bought into what we try to do. It\u2019s been a challenge with the education, language and facilities and bits and pieces. We\u2019ve got some work to do in 50-over cricket but we knew Twenty20 was our format. To come here and achieve this is a dream come true.\u201d\n\nCaptain Assad Vala said: \u201cWords can\u2019t express how we\u2019re feeling at the moment. We worked really hard to go where we are. We came in with not good form but our play all throughout the week has been outstanding.\u201d\n\nIreland also booked their place at next year\u2019s tournament, but Namibia, UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong will join Scotland and the Netherlands in the playoffs, where four remaining spots in Australia are still to be won.", "description": "Papua New Guinea\u2019s men\u2019s team have never played at a major International Cricket Council tournament, in any format of the game, but that will change next year", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7e7faa8b68e83196d8191f62e44eea979315872/497_502_3587_2153/master/3587.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea1d02c0ddb6a62cbe777d7c10a143a0", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
