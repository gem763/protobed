Consumer sentiment fell in August, posting its largest drop since 2012, the University of Michigan said Friday. Richard Curtin, the survey\u2019s chief economist, attributed the decline to Americans\u2019 concerns about tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe data indicate that the erosion of consumer confidence due to tariff policies is now well under way,\u201d Mr. Curtin said.\n\nWhile spending rose in July, the university\u2019s survey was conducted during August, a month in which President Trump and China announced new tariffs on billions of dollars of consumer goods.\n\nAn array of apparel, electronics, watches and sporting goods from China are set to be hit with tariffs of 15% starting Sept. 1, the latest escalation in the growing trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nHousehold income growth slowed sharply in July, rising just 0.1% after increasing 0.5% in June, Commerce said Friday. Wages and salaries edged up a modest 0.2%, while income on assets fell.\n\nIn July, though, shoppers were undeterred and more cash registers were ringing as Americans snapped up both long-lasting goods such as refrigerators and so-called nondurable goods like clothing. Other recent spending reports indicate consumers are holding up well. Retail sales, a separate Commerce Department measure of purchases at stores, restaurants and online, climbed 0.7% in July.\n\nThe July spending gains bode well for U.S. third-quarter growth. Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers on Friday projected gross domestic product would rise at a 2.3% annual rate in the July-through-September period. That would be better than the 2% pace in the second quarter, but down from 2.9% overall in 2018.\n\nAmericans\u2019 rate of saving fell slightly in July. The personal saving rate\u2014the difference between after-tax income and spending\u2014was 7.7% in July, down from 8.0% in June and the lowest level since November but still elevated.\n\nThe longer-term economic outlook remains uncertain due to cooling global growth, a faltering manufacturing sector, the fading effects from the 2017 tax cut and trade frictions.\n\nLooming tariffs are already putting some businesses on edge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling my customers, \u2018Shop now for Christmas because I\u2019m getting all these emails from all my vendors. They\u2019re all doing price increases starting September,\u201d said Tara Riceberg, owner of Los Angeles-area gift shops Tweak and Tesoro.\n\nMs. Riceberg will face price increases of up to 30% on furniture for her new store if she doesn\u2019t make purchases soon. Prices are going up on plastic bottles, travel pillows and hourglass minute timers from another vendor due to tariffs, meaning she will have no choice but to pass them along to customers.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be terrifying that something that I regularly sell at X is going to be 30% more expensive come December,\u201d Ms. Riceberg said.\n\nManufacturers continue to struggle. U.S. factory output fell in July from a month earlier and from a year earlier, the Federal Reserve reported.\n\nIHS Markit reported last week an index of factory activity in August fell in the U.S., Japan, Germany and the eurozone. The U.S. decline marked the first manufacturing contraction since September 2009, according to the firm\u2019s surveys of purchasing managers.\n\nBusiness spending remains a wild card. An underlying measure of business investment has been trending lower this year. But corporate profits rebounded strongly in the second quarter, according to figures released Thursday.\n\nFriday\u2019s report included the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, which showed price pressures remain mild. The price index for personal-consumption expenditures rose 0.2% in July from the prior month and increased 1.4% from a year earlier. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices were up 0.2% on the month and rose 1.6% from a year earlier.\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com", "description": "U.S. households ramped up their spending in July, providing reassurance that the economy\u2019s decadelong expansion continued to roll despite slowing factory activity and global growth.", "authors": ["Sarah Chaney", "Sarah.Chaney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-101701/social"}
