REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nBelow is an explanation of the backstop Britain agreed with Brussels in 2018, the new plan proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and why EU officials think it falls short:\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE BACKSTOP?\n\nNow, there are no border checks or infrastructure between the UK province of Northern Ireland and Ireland as both are in the EU\u2019s single market customs and regulatory arrangements.\n\nThe backstop in the 2018 Brexit deal was designed to prevent a hard border being introduced on the island of Ireland when Britain leaves the EU - whatever trade deal was eventually agreed between London and Brussels.\n\nIt envisaged that the United Kingdom would remain bound by some EU rules if no other way is found to keep the border between the British province and Ireland invisible.\n\nMaintaining a frictionless border was a key part of the 1998 Good Friday agreement between London and Dublin to end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nWHY DIDN\u2019T THAT WORK?\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers objected to the 2018 deal, saying the backstop would tie Britain to the EU come what may, leaving the country overseen by EU judges and preventing it from striking trade deals around the world. Parliament\u2019s rejection of the deal forced then-Prime Minister Theresa May from office.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE NEW PLAN?\n\nJohnson\u2019s new proposal is that after Brexit, Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the EU\u2019s single market rules for trade in animal, food and manufactured goods.\n\nBut the province would leave the EU\u2019s customs union, along with the rest of Britain, so the country as a whole could strike new trade deals.\n\nThe proposal also says the legislative assembly in Northern Ireland would have the right to decide every four years whether it wants to continue to abide by EU rules on traded goods.\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN?\n\nThe plan would effectively create two borders.\n\nFirst, there would be a regulatory border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Britain. Goods from mainland Britain would need to be checked to ensure they conform to EU standards, given Northern Ireland would be still be part of the European single market.\n\nIn addition, there would be a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Checks would be needed to ensure duties and taxes were paid on goods moving from Northern Ireland to within the EU and to prevent smuggling.\n\nThe British proposal says there would be no physical infrastructure along the 500 km (300 mile) border.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE BORDER ISSUE?\n\nAccording to Irish and EU officials, there are several issues with the plan proposed by Johnson, who is determined for Britain to leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.\n\nThey say there would inevitably have to be some form of border checks to preserve the integrity of the EU single market, and that would end frictionless trade on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cAny form of controls and checks in and around the border would signify the end of frictionless trade and as such would harm the all-island economy as well as represent a serious risk to the peace process,\u201d European Union lawmakers said in response to the UK plan.\n\nBritain has proposed only having physical checks on a very small proportion of traded goods at premises or designated locations anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland - to avoid having a physical hard border.\n\nThe arrangements would be supported by measures such as a trusted-trader scheme, simplified customs procedures, monitoring technology and exemptions for smaller business.\n\nWON\u2019T THAT WORK?\n\nEU officials say the proposals wouldn\u2019t provide enough reassurance for Ireland and other EU members that their single market was protected against price dumping, unfair competition and smuggling at the border\u2019s roughly 270 crossing points.\n\nAnd if Ireland fails to check goods coming into the EU from Britain, it could raise questions as to whether Irish exports to the bloc should remain free of checks at their ports, even though it will remain in the customs union.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the substance of the customs proposal working for the EU side. It creates regulatory friction with Britain and customs friction with the EU,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe of the Eurasia Group.\n\nANY OTHER ISSUES?\n\nAnother major sticking point is the proposal that the Northern Ireland assembly can review its membership of the EU single market every four years.\n\nThe EU worries this would give the regional authority an effective veto over the bloc\u2019s own affairs, and a rejection of regulatory alignment could trigger a return to a hard border.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically an exit clause with the keys given to the DUP,\u201d said a senior EU official, referring to the Northern Ireland unionist party that says maintaining the economic integrity of the United Kingdom is sacrosanct.\n\nUnder the original backstop, the EU would not allow Britain to withdraw from the arrangement unless it was satisfied any new trading rules would not result in the return of a hard border.\n\nAND TAXES?\n\nBritain has proposed that value-added tax and excise duty on goods moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland should not be paid or accounted for at the border. EU officials say this cannot work if Northern Ireland is still aligned to the bloc\u2019s single market regulations.\n\nCAN THE GAPS BE CLOSED?\n\nThe British government has billed its proposals as a \u201cfinal offer\u201d but Johnson said on Wednesday it was a \u201cbroad landing zone\u201d and signalled a readiness to have intensive discussions.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson was clear ... there is scope for movement,\u201d said Eurasia\u2019s Rahman. \u201cBut the UK position will have to move very far for there to be an agreement.\u201d", "description": "Britain's latest proposal for an agreement on the terms of its divorce from the European Union has been widely rebuffed in Brussels because it does not meet the objectives of the so-called Irish border backstop.", "authors": ["John Chalmers", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436714969&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921DY"}
