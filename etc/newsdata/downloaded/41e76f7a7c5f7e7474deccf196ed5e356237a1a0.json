REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nThe brief was filed on behalf of the company and Cook as an individual as well as Deirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of retail and people. The company said it has 443 employees who have benefited from the program, which was implemented in 2012 by the Republican Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nCook has previously criticized Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies, including his plan to end the program, but has generally maintained a close relationship with the president. They have dined together at least twice and Cook has regularly spoken with Trump about the economic impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Nov. 12 over Trump\u2019s 2017 plan to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Trump\u2019s move to rescind DACA was blocked by lower courts.\n\nThe program currently shields about 700,000 immigrants often called \u201cDreamers,\u201d mostly Hispanic young adults, from deportation and provides them work permits, though not a path to citizenship.\n\nMore than 100 companies, including Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and IBM Corp, joined a brief backing \u201cDreamers\u201d at an earlier stage of the litigation.\n\nCook\u2019s brief stated that the motivation for weighing in on one of the biggest cases before the Supreme Court in its new term that starts on Monday was to support of the company\u2019s diverse workforce.\n\n\u201cAmong those people are hundreds of DACA recipients who had no say in the decision to travel to this country and have known no other home,\u201d the brief stated.\n\n\u201cThey spark creativity and help drive innovation. They are among our most driven and selfless colleagues,\u201d the brief said.\n\nCook\u2019s brief is likely to be one of many filed in support of DACA recipients in the coming days ahead of a Friday deadline.\n\nA Supreme Court decision is due by the end of June, in the thick of next year\u2019s presidential race in which Trump is seeking re-election. Democratic presidential candidates including Joe Biden have pledged actions to protect the Dreamers and offer them citizenship.\n\nApple\u2019s big tech rival Microsoft Corp has been part of the legal challenge against Trump\u2019s DACA effort from the beginning, expressing similar concerns about how its employees would be affected.\n\nOthers that have challenged Trump\u2019s action include the University of California, labor unions and various states including California and New York.\n\nTrump and Cook had a previous tussle after the Wall Street Journal reported in June that Apple planned to move production of a new high-end Mac Pro computer from Texas to China.\n\nCook publicly said that Apple wanted to keep making the machines in the United States, and the company in July asked for tariff exemptions on imported parts.\n\nTrump said he would refuse to grant the exemptions but hoped Apple would build a plant in Texas. Last month, his administration lifted tariffs on some of the parts used to make the computers, and days later Apple said it would make the computers in Texas.", "description": "Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday filed a brief at the U.S. Supreme Court opposing President Donald Trump's effort to end a program that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought into the United States illegally as children.", "authors": ["Lawrence Hurley", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436468972&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911OZ"}
