The announcement sent shares in the LSE soaring 456p, or 6.7 per cent, to 7260p.\n\nLaura Cha, chairman of HKEX, said: \u201cWe believe a combination of HKEX and LSEG represents a highly compelling strategic opportunity to create a global market infrastructure group, bringing together the largest and most significant financial centres in Asia and Europe.\n\n\u201cFollowing early engagement with LSEG, we look forward to working with its board to demonstrate that this transaction is in the best interests of stakeholders, investors and both businesses.\u201d\n\nIt comes weeks after the London Stock Exchange revealed its plans to acquire data business Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters and private equity firm Blackstone in a \u00a322 billion deal to create a British-based rival to financial information group Bloomberg. The proposed Hong Kong merger is conditional on LSEG scrapping the Refinitiv takeover.\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom, who was appearing on Bloomberg TV as the news of the HKEX proposal broke, said that while Britain welcomes foreign investment, the Government would \u201clook very carefully at anything that had security implications for the UK\u201d.\n\nHKEX bought the London Metal Exchange in 2012 for \u00a31.4 billion. LSEG said it \u201cnotes the...unsolicited, preliminary and highly conditional proposal. LSEG remains committed to, and continues to make progress on, its proposed acquisition of Refinitiv Holdings Ltd as announced on 1 August, 2019.\u201d\n\nThe London Stock Exchange, which dates back to the 16th century, has seen off or abandoned a number of plans to merge with other markets over the years.\n\nIn 2000 it announced plans to merge with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse but these fell through. In 2006, it rejected an unsolicited approach from the US tech market NASDAQ valuing it at \u00a32.4 billion. In 2011, LSEG agreed to merge with the TMX Group, the owners of the Toronto Stock Exchange, but this plan was also abandoned. LSEG merged with Italy\u2019s Borsa Italiana in 2007.", "description": "An audacious \u00a330 billion take-over bid for the London Stock Exchange from the owner of Hong Kong\u2019s top financial markets rocked the City today.Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said it wants to merge the two huge bourses to create a \u201cglobal powerhouse\u201d linking the West with the fast-growing economies", "authors": ["Stephanie Cockroft"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/guEQmy.UZML2vnmVtUvaeg--~B/aD0zMDY7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/0165f3dd5a6958649ccb29c61bb7787b", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
