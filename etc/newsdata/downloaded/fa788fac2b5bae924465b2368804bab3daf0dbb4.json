After taking a pass from Marchand, Pastrnak slipped the puck between his own legs, then redirected it past Michael Hutchinson to give the a 1-0 lead.\n\n\"There's times through the year when pucks bounce against you and there's times when they bounce for you. Right now pucks are bouncing his way,\" Marchand said of Pastrnak. \"He has that ability to make those high-end plays. He puts himself in really good positions to capitalize on opportunities.\"\n\nPastrnak said the Bruins didn't let up despite the disappointment from having their first goal waved off.\n\n\"I knew we were going to get another one. We were feeling good,\" he said.\n\nKasperi Kapanen and Alexander Kerfoot had a goal and assist apiece for the Maple Leafs, who were coming off an overtime loss to Columbus at home on Monday night.\n\nThere for the taking\n\nCoach Mike Babcock said the Leafs improved from the night before, when they led 3-2 after the second but couldn't hold off the Blue Jackets in the third, then the OT.\n\n\"It was one of those games. It was a grind the whole thing. There wasn't much room for either team,\" Babcock said. \"In the end, the game was right there in the third period. . We were unable to get it done.\"\n\nMichael Hutchinson stopped 35 shots.\n\nThe Maple Leafs tied after falling behind 1-0 and 2-1, but couldn't get anything past Rask in the third period.\n\n\"I just don't think we spent enough times in the offence zone and weren't heavy enough on pucks. They kept on breaking out and applying pressure on our D,\" Kapanen said. \"We spent a lot of time in our own zone and eventually they're going to score when the flow of the game goes like that.\"\n\nAfter having a goal disallowed earlier in the game, David Pastrnak makes no mistake on this one and lets the refs know about it \ud83c\udf5d <a href=\"https://t.co/faKJtFLvl0\">pic.twitter.com/faKJtFLvl0</a> \u2014@hockeynight\n\nRitchie's unassisted goal 6:35 into the third put Boston back up 3-2 and Lindholm got his first of the season when he poked in a rebound with 2:03 left in the game.\n\nKapanen tied it on a one-timer off a crossing pass from Kerfoot with just under 4 1/2 minutes into the middle period.
