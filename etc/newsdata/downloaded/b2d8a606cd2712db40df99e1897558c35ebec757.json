Instead she released a video message to talk about the government\u2019s new direction amid the city\u2019s worst political crisis since the 1997 handover.\n\nThe speech promised new measures to ease Hong Kong\u2019s housing shortage and improve the economy, but did not make any concessions to the protesters, including their demands for political reform and an investigation into alleged police abuses.\n\nLam promised to improve support services for special needs students and to turn a previous one-off payment to secondary, primary and kindergarten students into an annual grant of HK$2,500. The handout is expected to benefit 900,000 students. A total of HK$1 billion was also pledged to support publicly aided schools to do minor building work.\n\nHong Kong protests: Friends of radical student protesters should help them gain perspective and defuse tensions\n\nThe government will also modify the Public Transport Fare Subsidy Scheme, under which commuters can get cashback on their Octopus at MTR stations. The payout will be increased from a quarter to a third of expenses over HK$400, with a cap increase from HK$300 to HK$400 a month.\n\nDr Edmund Cheng Wai, Associate Professor at City University\u2019s department of public policy, pointed out that this year\u2019s policy address did not have a section on politics nor any blueprint for political moves, which could be a reflection of the government\u2019s belief that people\u2019s grievances are linked to livelihood issues.\n\nHong Kong protests: What are the 'five demands'? What do protesters want?\n\n\u201cThere were some bold moves in the area of housing and land use, such as relaxing the borrowing conditions for home purchases. It may help shore up support among a segment of society,\u201d Cheng said.\n\nBut there is some doubt about how much the policy address will help connect with young people.\n\n\u201cThere is a low possibility of it working. The effects of the earlier community dialogues are still in question,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the protests being leaderless, it will be very difficult for a trustworthy figure to become an intermediary.\u201d", "description": "Chief executive delivered her speech via recorded video after being heckled by opposition lawmakers in the Legislative Council.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/fc4fd6a8-efdb-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires180938.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
