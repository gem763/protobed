And Democrats on the committee don\u2019t seem too bothered by that prospect.\n\n\u201cObviously, the campaign finance violations are serious, but I would say in the context of all the evidence and all the witnesses we intend to bring forward for the committee, she wouldn't be on the top of my list,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cI just think some of the other corruption is easier to demonstrate and will be more powerful testimony.\"\n\nPublicly, so far, the relevant stakeholders are staying mum about a Daniels invite, or lack thereof. No Democratic lawmaker or aide would or could confirm that there are ongoing talks with Daniels about a possible appearance in front of Congress. And Daniels\u2019 attorney, Clark Brewster, told The Daily Beast that he was unable to make a statement confirming whether any discussions are taking place between his client and Democratic lawmakers.\n\nPrivately, however, House Democrats have been weighing the possible impact of testimony from Daniels, as they plan out a series of hearings focusing on Trump\u2019s alleged campaign finance violations. The hearings are set to take place in October in the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nAn appearance by Daniels before that panel would undoubtedly supercharge public interest in Democrats\u2019 oversight efforts, which are flagging after Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation came to a conclusion and amid mixed messaging from the party on whether to start impeachment proceedings. But testimony from this particular witness\u2014who is unique in combining a Mueller-level public profile with some inherently salacious subject matter\u2014would also create a spectacle that, Democrats fear, could easily become an out-of-control circus.\n\nThat calculus has divided Democrats on Capitol Hill: some argue that Daniels\u2019 appearance would be a disaster no matter what, while others counter that their oversight campaign is in need of lifeblood. Others still say that her testimony wouldn\u2019t offer much that the public doesn\u2019t already know, though if it became clear that new information could be gathered, their calculus might change.\n\nIf Daniels is needed as a fact witness, she should \u201cabsolutely\u201d be brought in, said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), another Judiciary member. \u201cI'm not sure if we need her, but if we do, we should bring her in,\u201d he added. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s just part of the spectacle.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats are worried that the GOP members of the Judiciary panel\u2014which includes some of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders\u2014would feast on the spectacle of Daniels\u2019 testimony to score political points and degrade Democrats.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of preventing a political circus from happening, I doubt that's in the best interest of the committee,\u201d said a Democratic aide. \u201cWe already have Michael Cohen's reimbursement checks, one signed by the president himself. With her political baggage, I don't see how her testimony helps us any more than it helps Republicans at this point.\u201d\n\nCongressional testimony has, indeed, already implicated Trump in campaign finance violations through the hush money payments. In February, Cohen, the president\u2019s former fixer and attorney, appeared before the House Oversight Committee, where he testified that Trump directed him to pay off the women and presented a copy of a check showing Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payouts. Cohen also said Trump instructed him to lie in February 2018 that he had no knowledge of any hush money. Several members of Congress said they were satisfied with what Cohen\u2019s testimony established and doubted Daniels could offer more\u2014aside from salacious details about Trump.\n\nAnd Cohen may yet reveal more: multiple news outlets reported Wednesday that from his current home in an upstate New York federal prison, Cohen entered into an agreement with prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, who are investigating the Trump Organization\u2019s role in the hush money payments.\n\nFor some Democrats, that remains the trail to follow. But for others, the thought of Daniels coming to the Hill to explain her role in the affair may be too politically tempting to resist. As one Democratic aide put it, sometimes \u201cyou need a circus to fight a circus.\u201d", "description": "They\u2019re investigating the president\u2019s hush money payments.
