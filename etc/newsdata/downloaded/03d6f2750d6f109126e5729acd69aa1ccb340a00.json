(AP) - Scott Harrington enjoyed his long-awaited debut as a PGA Tour member.\n\nIn his 17th year as a professional, the 38-year-old rookie shot a 6-under 64 on Thursday, leaving him two strokes behind first-round leader Robby Shelton in the A Military Tribute at The Greenbrier.\n\nWith all 21 tour rookies and other Korn Ferry Tour graduates in the field, the first round of the PGA Tour\u2019s season opener in West Virginia was a chance for the new guys and journeymen to make an impression.\n\nEspecially for Harrington.\n\n\u201cI always did think I was going to get here,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cEven though I\u2019m 38 years old, I feel like I\u2019m every bit as capable of winning out here as any 22 year old. Yeah, age is just a number.\u201d\n\nHarrington turned pro in 2003 and played in four PGA Tour events over the next 12 years. He took time off last year to be with his wife, Jenn, who was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The disease is now in remission.\n\nHe locked up his first PGA Tour card with a runner-up finish last month at a Korn Ferry event in his hometown of Portland, Oregon.\n\nIn his debut Thursday, Harrington hit just nine fairways and 12 greens in regulation but made four birdies in a five-hole stretch around the turn.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly remember this one for sure. I\u2019ll remember it even more if I can put a few more good ones together.\u201d\n\nShelton made eight starts on tour as a non-member in 2016-17. He has his tour card for the first time after winning two Korn Ferry events in May.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fired up,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cLast night it was tough to sleep. I\u2019ve been waiting for this moment all season.\u201d\n\nStarting on the back nine on the Old White TPC, the 24-year-old Shelton made the turn at 3 under and birdied Nos. 1-3. The 8-under 62 is his lowest score on tour.\n\nDefending champion Kevin Na, Lanto Griffin, Mark Hubbard and Zack Sucher matched Harrington at 64.\n\nNa\u2019s putter won last year\u2019s tournament. On Thursday, his approach shots got him onto the first page of the leaderboard. He had four birdies over his final six holes. Three of his back-nine birdies were putts of under 10 feet.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of good memories here and I\u2019m excited to be back defending,\u201d Na said. \u201cNice to see my picture up on the wall and have my own defending champion locker. It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nHubbard, who won once in 23 Korn Ferry events last season, had a bogey-free round and is looking for his first top-10 finish since joining the PGA Tour in 2015.\n\n\u201cFinishing 40th every week isn\u2019t fun. Grinding to make cuts isn\u2019t fun,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cI feel like I needed to go back and get that experience and learn how to win again, and this time around I think I\u2019ll find myself in the mix a lot more.\u201d\n\nBrian Harman, Sung Kang, Harold Varner III and Jimmy Walker topped the group at 65.\n\nHank Lebioda birdied seven of his first 11 holes in a 67.\n\nBryson DeChambeau, at No. 10 the highest-ranked player in the world in the field, had a 68.\n\nFormer Marshall player Davey Jude shot 70, two months after his father and caddie, David, was among seven people killed in a helicopter accident in the Bahamas.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP golf coverage: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Scott Harrington enjoyed his long-awaited debut as a PGA Tour member.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/greenbrier_golf_50097_c0-138-3300-2062_s1770x1032.jpg?e1f564f8f6be3edbe5b27839a1e93c520c57831d"}
