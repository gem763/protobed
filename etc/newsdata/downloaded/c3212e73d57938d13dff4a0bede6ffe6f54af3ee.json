It fitted her image as a star who shunned the glitz and hoopla of Hollywood.\n\nNow a cache of 65 intimate letters, to be sold at auction, show just how lonely Garbo\u2019s hours of solitude really were. The pencilled sheets were all written to her great friend, the Austrian actress and writer Salka Viertel, over a period of 40 years between 1932 and 1973. The candid evidence of Garbo\u2019s introspection is expected to fetch as much as $60,000, such is the interest of film collectors.\n\nIn one letter, penned to Viertel in 1937 during a trip to Sweden, Garbo claims: \u201cI go nowhere, see no one.\u201d She adds that she did the same when in Hollywood, and pleads with her old friend to rescue her. \u201cIt is hard and sad to be alone, but sometimes it\u2019s even more difficult to be with someone \u2026 When we are here on Earth it would be so much more kind if for this short time we would be forever strong and young. I wonder why God preferred it this way \u2026 somewhere in this world are a few beings who do not have it as we have, of that I am certain. And if I would stop making film I could go and see if I could find out a little about it.\u201d\n\nThe letters first came up for sale in 1993,when they were bought by a fan from Florida. They are now being auctioned by a private owner and their contents will add weight to the Garbo myth, confirming her as the original model of a Nordic Noir heroine.\n\nAlthough Garbo\u2019s onscreen air of melancholy was clearly genuine, she found the popular idea that she always avoided company irritating. \u201cI never said: \u2018I want to be alone,\u2019\u201d she once explained in a 1955 Life magazine article. \u201cI only said, \u2018I want to be let alone! There is all the difference.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of the Garbo letters on sale at Swann Auction Galleries.

Living in Hollywood, far from the northern climate of her homeland, it is clear that the actress relied on her friends in Europe to help her cope with the exasperations of the film industry.\n\nViertel, regarded by biographers as her closest friend, co-wrote a number of Garbo\u2019s greatest films and appeared opposite her in the German-language version of Anna Christie, filmed in 1930. In later life she moved to Switzerland to be near her son, the writer Peter Viertel, married to the Scottish film star Deborah Kerr. Right up until Viertel\u2019s death in 1978, Garbo (\u201cMiss G\u201d or \u201cGrusha\u201d) would leave her home in New York to join her friend.\n\nThe letters to Viertel, to be sold in the fine books and manuscripts sale at Swann Auction Galleries, also contain several insights into Garbo\u2019s dismissive views on directors and producers. In a letter from around 1935 she discusses the run-up to shooting her 1936 film Camille with director Irving Thalberg and says that she would rather switch studios and work with David O Selznick, who went on to make Gone with the Wind three years later.\n\n\u201cGod help me if Thalberg does it alone \u2026 I could write Mayer otherwise and perhaps he could let Selznick do Camille. We would have to move over to United [Artists].\u201d\n\nLater she writes: \u201cPlease ask Thalberg to think very carefully about Camille. It\u2019s so like Anna Karenina that I am afraid. It\u2019s devastating to do the same story again.\u201d", "description": "The star told her closest friend of her isolation in a series of notes that are now up for auction", "authors": ["Vanessa Thorpe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2bf63a178e5a96f1e2faf8dc65815f3b916d770/0_284_2769_1662/master/2769.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=def607ca1aa8db8fefcc21ada334c600", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
