It's happening again'", "language": "en", "text": "How do you follow up a masterpiece like Under the Skin? By giving BBC Two viewers five minutes of unexpected hell. The visionary director on how a Trump hunting trip inspired his mystery short\n\nThe Americas with Simon Reeve is an amiable travelogue in which a dishy documentarian gads about the US. This Sunday night he was in California, examining giant redwoods and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mansion. At 10pm, the credits rolled and, abruptly, BBC Two plunged us into hell.\n\nFor five minutes before the start of Live at the Apollo, the channel screened a new short film in which a masked mob hang a man in a forest. He plunges for what feels an eternity (actually 86 seconds) down a well from the wooden gibbet, before the rope stops spooling and the man \u2013 miraculously alive \u2013 slowly starts to haul his way towards the light. It was broadcast without introduction or credits. There was no clue as to who was responsible.\n\nIn fact, The Fall is the latest film by Jonathan Glazer, the British director behind gangster comedy Sexy Beast, chilly Nicole Kidman reincarnation drama Birth and Under the Skin, in which Scarlett Johansson\u2019s erotic alien feeds on Glaswegians. All three are brilliant; Under the Skin is a masterpiece, last month named by this paper as the fourth best film of the century so far.\n\nThe Fall, his first work since Under the Skin, feels entirely of a piece. Long, eerie takes, a score by Mica Levi (there is no dialogue), bright light shining through the pitch black, and everything freighted with exhilarating dread.\n\nGlazer, now 54, wants to be reticent about the film, to let it speak for itself. \u201cI thought it would benefit most from being dropped unannounced,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to frame it with any expectation.\u201d This is the only press he\u2019s doing, and he\u2019ll only answer questions by email. Yet he\u2019s curiously fulsome, despite himself.\n\nThe Fall may be brief, but it turns out to have at least five heavyweight inspirations \u2013 the most flippant of which is a snap of Eric and Donald Trump Jr on a big-game hunting jaunt. \u201cThe day I saw a picture of the Trump sons grinning with a dead leopard,\u201d he says, was the day he came up with a shot of the mob posing for a selfie with their prey.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jonathan Glazer. Photograph: Claudio Onorati/EPA\n\nIt\u2019s a moment that hauls a story, whose bare bones recall Reconstruction-era America and even stone-age justice, firmly into the present. The masks mix early man and modern social protest \u2013 half Neanderthal, half Vendetta.\n\n\u201cI think fear is ever-present,\u201d says Glazer when asked if a lynch-mob mentality is currently being given freer rein. \u201cAnd that drives people to irrational behaviour. A mob encourages an abdication of personal responsibility. The rise of National Socialism in Germany for instance was like a fever that took hold of people. We can see that happening again.\u201d\n\nAside from The Fall, the feature-length film Glazer has been working on for the past six years is a Holocaust drama set in Auschwitz, apparently based on Martin Amis\u2019s novel The Zone of Interest, about a Nazi officer who becomes infatuated with the camp commander\u2019s wife. That film, due to shoot next spring, is \u201cvery much its own thing,\u201d he says. Yet he has spoken about his fascination with photos of Germans thrilled by the horrors they were witnessing \u2013 something seemingly explored in The Fall.\n\nAnother starting point for the short, he says, was a Bertolt Brecht poem written in exile in the 1930s: \u201cIn the dark times / Will there also be singing? Yes, there will also be singing / About the dark times.\u201d These lines, says Glazer, were inscribed on the inside cover of a collection of essays given to him by a friend.\n\nOther inspirations include the Goya self-portrait The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, in which the napping artist is plagued by flapping bats, generally interpreted as a critique of Spanish society as ignorant, insane and corrupt. \u201cAlso,\u201d says Glazer, \u201chis Disasters of War etchings, urgently titled I Saw It or This Is Worse. Hell on earth, witnessed like a photojournalist such as Robert Capa or Don McCullin. Ferocious, factual, unflinching.\u201d\n\nIn case it\u2019s not clear, Glazer is an uncompromisingly serious-minded film-maker. Ask him what he\u2019s enjoyed lately and he says Krzystof Kie\u015blowski\u2019s 1979 meta-drama Camera Buff (\u201ca great film about film-making and the nature and ethics of it\u201d). Few directors treat film of all forms with more gravity. Though this may be his first fictional short in 26 years, Glazer built his reputation with astonishing music videos for the likes of Radiohead (he credits 1996\u2019s Street Spirit as the turning point in his artistic development) and ads such as Guinness\u2019s horses in the surf.\n\n\u201cAnthony Minghella said a short film should be like a perfect sentence,\u201d he says, \u201cAnd I thought that was a really good way of thinking about them.\u201d As for The Fall premiering on TV? Glazer won\u2019t quite pronounce on whether some genres, such as the superhero movies made by Marvel, are \u2013 in the words of Martin Scorsese \u2013 \u201cnot cinema\u201d.\n\n\u201cI believe cinema is a frontier. Absolutely. And the films I\u2019m most interested in are the ones with that in mind.\u201d\n\nFood for thought. Especially for those who\u2019d only tuned in for Live at the Apollo.\n\nThe Fall is a BBC Films and Academy Films co-production. It is available now on the BBC iPlayer\n\nPeter Bradshaw\u2019s verdict on The Fall\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A still from The Fall.\n\nIn some mysterious or post-apocalyptic forest, a group of masked figures surround their human victim, whom they have shaken down from a tree. With a noose around his neck, attached to a very long rope, he is forced to pose for a \u201chunt trophy\u201d selfie and then dropped into a deep well or shaft. His tormentors gaze down into the abyss, and then saunter and dance away, apparently satisfied that he is dead. But the man has managed to brace his legs against the side of the pit and halt his fall before the rope is pulled taut around his neck, and he has survived. Now he has to climb out of there: is it a moment of desperate hope? Or another turn of the screw, another stage in the enigmatic ordeal?\n\nAny new work from Jonathan Glazer is exciting news, and this intriguing short film \u2013 screened unannounced on the BBC \u2013 shows that he is experimenting with new modes of distribution, release and engagement. It also shows his flair for the startling and disquieting image: the sinister impassive faces; the tree shaking; and the long implacable, inhuman whine of the pulley mechanism as the body is dropped. It is all assisted by the coercively sinister score by Mica Levi.\n\nThe Fall may be a taste of a longer feature to come, or perhaps it is intended as a standalone piece: a haiku of horror in which the centrepiece is that grisly selfie \u2013 the snapshot is starkly presented \u2013 like the horrendous photos taken of grinning whites around deep south lynchings in the Jim Crow era, given a new banality-of-evil effect in the age of Instagram. Is this the way the world ends, humanity ends? In a spasm of real-world bullying and paranoia to match the pile-ons and the polarised rage of social media? Is this our fall? If it is, it is hardly a fall from grace.\n\n", "description": "How do you follow up a masterpiece like Under the Skin? By giving BBC Two viewers five minutes of unexpected hell.
