She has flown into him as his seat was spinning and then she went into the barricades.\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\n\u201cAll I saw was the girl flying through the barricades. We thought she came off the ride my son was on so I just ran over to help.\u201d\n\nOne bystander said the woman \u201clooked practically dead\u201d with a gash on her neck and there was blood all over.\n\nAnother witness said: \u201cThe bar failed and a girl just came flying off it while it was in motion. It\u2019s at the back in the corner near West Park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been shut and the emergency services are there. There is a lot of blood. It doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d\n\nMr Corran, of east Hull, rushed to the aid of the girl, unaware that his son was also injured.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you can understand [paramedics] were dealing with her because she was in a worse state. We thought she was dead because she was laid there lifeless.\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\n\u201cI ran to help the girl and didn\u2019t even realise that she had hit my boy.\n\n\u201cI then heard from my wife and daughter that Ben had been hurt. They would not let me on to get to him so I pushed my way through.\n\n\u201cThe paramedics were all around her and Ben and I think that scared him even more.\n\n\u201cI will say I think if it weren\u2019t for Ben being there it could have been worse for the girl because she could have gone into the mechanisms of the Sizzler.\u201d\n\nMr Corran says he and his family will never go back to Hull Fair following their ordeal.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are never going again. It should be closed down and disbanded.\n\n\u201cI tell you something they have lost more customers than just ourselves.\n\n(Image: Katie Pugh)\n\n\u201cThe more people I can show about the dangers of Hull Fair the more people are going to be made aware and they will make it safer.\"\n\nEmergency services, including St John\u2019s Ambulance, rushed onto the scene following the accident.\n\nA police cordon was put in place around both rides which remained closed for the remainder of the night.\n\nPassers-by were left stunned by what had happened saying it made them think twice about going on the rides.\n\nAmy Louis Jackson, 25, said: \"It\u2019s scary. That\u2019s one of the rides I normally go on that one.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear stories like this I won\u2019t go on them again. It puts you off. It makes you think twice about health and safety.\u201d\n\nMacauley Cross, 24, from Patrington, said: \u201cYou expect the worst when you see this. No chance am I going on it. You won\u2019t catch me on owt like that.\u201d\n\n(Image: Dan Rowlands / SWNS.com)\n\n(Image: Dan Rowlands / SWNS.com)\n\nHumberside Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.\n\nChief Inspector Paul Kirby, tactical commander for Hull Fair, said: \u201cA woman has sadly been seriously injured this evening at Hull Fair and taken to hospital by ambulance.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe her injuries are life threatening or life changing.\n\n\u201cA teenage boy was struck by the woman as she fell. He thankfully only sustained minor injuries.\n\n\u201cWe have very well established plans in place with the council for any incident like this at the fair, and I want to thank everyone for their patience while we deal with this.\n\n\u201cI am appealing for anyone who might have seen what happened, or who has any video footage of it to contact us.
