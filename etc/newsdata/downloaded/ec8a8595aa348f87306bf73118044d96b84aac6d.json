Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) during a defense of women\u2019s reproductive rights at Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate between the Democratic hopefuls.\n\n\u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women\u2019s access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today,\u201d said Harris, one of 12 Democrats onstage vying for the nomination.\n\n\u201cThere are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care,\u201d she added, presumably referring to ongoing efforts to restrict abortion access. \u201cAnd it is not an exaggeration to say women will die \u2014 poor women, women of color will die \u2014 because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.\u201d\n\nGiven that women make up more than half of the country\u2019s population, she said, \u201cpeople need to keep their hands off of women\u2019s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.\u201d\n\nAbout three in four women who obtained abortions in 2014 were poor or low-income, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive-health think tank that supports abortion rights. More than half of abortion patients are also women of color, with black women accounting for 28% of abortion procedures in 2014 and Hispanic women accounting for 25%.\n\nHarris\u2019s reproductive-rights comments came as a handful of states, including Missouri, Alabama and Georgia, have passed anti-abortion legislation \u2014 some of which has been challenged in federal courts.\n\nSome states have also imposed regulations on clinics and people who provide abortions, including specifications dictating the size of an abortion-procedure room or a facility\u2019s distance from a hospital, and requirements for an abortion provider\u2019s certifications or hospital affiliations. Critics of such regulations argue that they go beyond necessary patient-safety measures.\n\nRepublican lawmakers say they oppose \u201ctaxpayer-funded abortion,\u201d and anti-abortion groups say the unborn have a right to life, believe life begins at fertilization and object to abortion on moral grounds. Some abortion opponents believe abortion is wrong under any circumstances, while others believe it can be acceptable in cases of rape, incest or in cases when a woman\u2019s life is at risk.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months will hear arguments on the case June Medical Services v. Gee, which centers on a Louisiana law mandating that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a local hospital \u2014 the court\u2019s first major abortion-rights case since Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. The Supreme Court previously held in the 2016 case Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt that a similar such provision in Texas was unconstitutional.\n\nSome states also require abortion seekers to wait a minimum time period between in-person counseling and their procedure, a measure that proponents argue is necessary to ensure that women are 100% sure they want to go ahead with a procedure.\n\nBut some critics contend that such counseling can include misleading information, and that the need to make two trips to a provider \u201ccould constitute a hardship for some women.\u201d\n\nThese mandatory waiting periods can also drive up the percentage of women of having riskier second-trimester abortions, according to a recent study conducted by Texas A&M University researchers, one of whom has served as an expert witness in abortion-regulation litigation.\n\nCarrying an unwanted pregnancy to term is associated with serious health risks, according to a 2016 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Women\u2019s Health Issues, a publication of George Washington University\u2019s Jacobs Institute of Women\u2019s Health, which focuses on women\u2019s reproductive and health issues.\n\n\u201cWomen who gave birth reported potentially life-threatening complications, such as eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage, whereas those having abortions did not,\u201d the study authors wrote of their sample. \u201cWomen who gave birth reported the need to limit physical activity for a period of time three times longer than that reported by women who received abortions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, an Annals of Internal Medicine study published last summer found that in the long term, \u201chaving an abortion is not detrimental to a women\u2019s health, but being denied access to a wanted abortion likely is,\u201d as its lead author explained in a statement.\n\nThe American Psychological Association says nationally representative samples on the aftereffects of abortion on women\u2019s mental health are required to get an accurate picture, but they\u2019re difficult to come by given the variety of factors that lead to women seeking an abortion and their physical and emotional state prior to getting pregnant. The APA reviewed decades of studies that came up with conflicting results on the mental health of women who had abortions.\n\n\u201cNone of the literature reviewed adequately addressed the prevalence of mental health problems among women in the United States who have had an abortion,\u201d it found. \u201cIn general, however, the prevalence of mental-health problems observed among women in the United States who had a single, legal, first-trimester abortion for non-therapeutic reasons was consistent with normative rates of comparable mental health problems in the general population of women in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s psychological experience of abortion is not uniform,\u201d it added, but depends on the women\u2019s lives and relationships at the time that a decision was made to terminate the pregnancy was made, plus events and conditions that occur in women\u2019s lives subsequent to an abortion \u201cand the larger social-political context in which abortion takes place.\u201d\n\nWomen who are turned away from having abortions also do worse on a range of economic measures, some research has shown. The denial of such services \u201cexacerbates\u201d the hardship of those already struggling to make ends meet, according to a 2018 American Journal of Public Health study.\n\nThe study received funding from three foundations, the Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which support abortion rights. The researchers say they had \u201cno role in the design and conduct of the study.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaws that impose a gestational limit for abortion or otherwise restrict access to abortion will result in worsened economic outcomes for women,\u201d its authors wrote.", "description": "About three in four women who obtained abortions in 2014 were poor or low-income.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT426_harris_ZG_20191016133525.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
