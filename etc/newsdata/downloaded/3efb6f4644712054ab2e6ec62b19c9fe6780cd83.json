Don't be a fool!\"\n\nThe US House of Representatives voted 354-60 on Wednesday to condemn Trump's decision to withdraw some 1,000 US special forces from northeast Syria, effectively clearing the way for Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces there.\n\nThe bipartisan vote was a stark warning to the president that Congress did not support his abrupt decision, which left Kurdish fighters to fend for themselves. They later joined hands with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against Turkey.\n\nMeanwhile, US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are on their way to Ankara to hold talks with Erdogan on the Turkish offensive.", "description": "Trump says Turkish group PKK probably a bigger 'terrorist threat' than ISIL as he faces criticism over his Syria move.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/bc4ecf17d487466c9271b02fa5a60e3e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
