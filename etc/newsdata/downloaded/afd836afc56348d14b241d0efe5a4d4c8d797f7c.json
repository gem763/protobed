With the franchise currently in between quarterbacks, playing both journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick and recently acquired second-year starter Josh Rosen, the Dolphins clearly wouldn't mind landing first overall pick in the 2020 draft and the right to draft Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nAll it takes to ensure that they get that top pick is to finish the year as the worst team in football.\n\nThe Miami's front office's intentions became rather clear after the team traded away left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills to the Houston Texans in exchange for a boatload of picks in the next two drafts \u2014 a move that reportedly was met with a potential \"revolt\" from the Dolphins players.\n\nAfter Sunday's lackluster effort on the field, it looks as though the rumored revolt has taken hold, and it's unclear how the Dolphins will proceed \u2014 the team could likely continue trading away players in order to acquire more picks for the future, but Miami does still have to field a football team every week, and ideally not embarrass themselves through 17 weeks of the NFL season.\n\nAs the Dolphins attempt to mitigate the fallout of their devastating loss to the Ravens, things don't get easier any time soon, as New England comes to town next Sunday, a visit that will likely include the debut of newly acquired wide receiver Antonio Brown in his first game as a Patriot.\n\n'Not bad for a running back': Lamar Jackson silenced his doubters with a brilliant performance\n\nJags linebacker Myles Jack goes berserk after being ejected from Jaguars-Chiefs game for throwing a punch\n\nIt took Patrick Mahomes just 96 seconds to throw his first touchdown pass of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWhy Antonio Brown can't play for the New England Patriots in Week 1", "description": "Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores is in for a long season as his front office seems content to play for next year.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d75a68a2e22af009b47c032-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
