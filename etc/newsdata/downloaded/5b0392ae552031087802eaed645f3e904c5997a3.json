Either way, they are wrong. What is being attempted with Thunberg is one of the oldest tricks in the book. First, you find a young person who shares your politics and cast them as the uncorrupted prophet of a new generation. Second, you have them argue their case as often and as loudly as possible. Third, you cast all pushback as \u201cinappropriate\u201d or \u201cbullying\u201d or \u201cpunching down.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d you ask, \u201care you criticizing this sweet little girl who is just trying to help us in our quest to reorder the entire world?\u201d\n\nComments\n\nThis process is not only transparent; it is grotesque. There exists no universe in which one can simultaneously cast a person as a brave truth-teller whose words must be heeded, and as an innocent, fragile child who is beneath the notice of any well-rounded adult. A sword is not a shield and a shield is not a sword. One must pick one. If Thunberg\u2019s tears are notable on one side of the political ledger, then they are notable on the other. If her anger and fear and instability are the key to her message and appeal, then they may be referenced by her critics, too. If her age makes her different, then . . . well, her age makes her different: \u201cGosh, she\u2019s only sixteen!\u201d \u201cYes, exactly, she\u2019s only sixteen.\u201d To indulge any other approach than this is to permit one group within our raucous political conversation to short-circuit it completely.", "description": "", "authors": ["Charles Cooke", "Nationalreview.Com Corner Greta-Thunberg-Cannot-Be-Both-A-Shield-And-A-Sword"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
