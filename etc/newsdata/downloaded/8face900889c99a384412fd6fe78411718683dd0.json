If they decide to fund any higher capital requirements by retaining local profits, they are unlikely to require additional capital domestically.\"\n\nAPRA aims to finalise its changes after January 31, when a consultation period closes, and to impose the new standard from the start of 2021.\n\nANZ said it was reviewing APRA's consultation paper.\n\n\"An update will be provided after further analysis,\" the bank said.\n\nShares in Australia's big four banks were mixed at the open, with ANZ slightly higher, NAB flat, and Commonwealth and Westpac lower by 0.27 and 0.42 per cent respectively.", "description": "The prudential regulator says some banks may have to raise additional capital as a result of its review of how much equity lenders must hold to support...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
