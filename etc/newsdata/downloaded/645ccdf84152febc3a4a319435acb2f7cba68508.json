Wang also announced that Beijing will send its top negotiator, vice-premier Liu He, to lead negotiations with the US in early October.\n\nThose talks will take place after a week-long holiday to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nRecent economic data has shown that China\u2019s economy is suffering from Washington\u2019s imposition of tariffs on over half its exports to the US. Factory output growth has hit a 17-year low, and car sales have fallen in 14 of the last 15 months.\n\nChina\u2019s commerce minister, Zhong Shan, told a news conference in Beijing on Sunday that the trade dispute is causing unprecedented challenges.\n\nThe US president, Donald Trump, claimed last week that China wants to make a trade deal \u201cvery badly\u201d, and that it could come sooner than the markets expect. But Washington is also considering new limits on US investments in China.\n\nAccording to government insiders, this could include preventing Chinese companies from listing on the US stock market. Curbing the ability of US government pension funds to buy Chinese equities is also being considered, according to government insiders.\n\nShares in Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce company, tumbled by 5% on Friday night, after the plan was reported.\n\nThe prospect of Chinese companies being barred from US exchanges alarmed the Nasdaq, which warned that the move could hurt investors.\n\n\u201cOne critical quality of our capital markets is that we provide non-discriminatory and fair access to all eligible companies. The statutory obligation of all US equity exchanges to do so creates a vibrant market that provides diverse investment opportunities for US investors,\u201d it said in a statement.", "description": "Shares in Chinese firms fell after reports Washington may place new limits on investment", "authors": ["Graeme Wearden", "Larry Elliott", "Mohamed El-Erian"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b4748fa5c635b2deb4fbe01b150a6af2428ec5f/0_157_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=41ac3f72424340b7acb56104b5334ece", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
