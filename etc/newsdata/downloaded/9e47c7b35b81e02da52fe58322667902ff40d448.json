Throughout history, these objectives have gone hand in hand\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way today. Frederick Douglass once called free expression \u201cthe great moral renovator of society.\u201d Movements like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo depend on people openly sharing their experiences. And the ability to speak freely has been central in the global fight for democracy. Allowing greater numbers of people to share their perspectives is how society becomes more inclusive.\n\nBut increasingly, this idea is being challenged. Some believe that free expression is driving us apart rather than bringing us together. Others from across the political spectrum believe that achieving their preferred political outcome is more important than allowing every person to have a voice.\n\nThe power of individuals to express themselves has expanded rapidly in recent decades. But in times of social turmoil, there\u2019s often an impulse to pull back on free expression. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his \u201cLetter From a Birmingham Jail\u201d while locked up for protesting peacefully. When America was polarized about its role in World War I, the Supreme Court ruled that the prominent socialist Eugene V. Debs could be imprisoned for an antiwar speech.\n\nToday, in another time of social tension, the impulse to restrict speech is back. We face a choice: We can stand for free expression, understanding its messiness but believing that the long journey toward progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us. Or we can decide the cost is too great.\n\nI believe we must stand for free expression. But three major threats stand in the way.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nFirst, laws around the world are undermining expression by restricting speech and imposing one country\u2019s speech restrictions on others. Until recently, the internet was mostly defined by American platforms with strong free-expression values. But there\u2019s no guarantee these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top 10 are Chinese. While encrypted services like WhatsApp are used by protesters and activists everywhere, on TikTok\u2014the Chinese app growing quickly around the world\u2014mention of protests are censored, even in the U.S. As American policy makers define internet regulations to address public safety, they should help free expression triumph.\n\nThe second challenge to free expression is the internet platforms themselves\u2014including Facebook. Facebook makes a lot of decisions that affect people\u2019s ability to express themselves. Our values are inspired by the American tradition, but a strict First Amendment standard would mean allowing content like terrorist propaganda or bullying. Most Americans agree that people should be free to say things others don\u2019t like, but no one should be able to put others in danger. So the question is where to draw the line.\n\n\u00a9 Barbara Kelley At Facebook, we\u2019re focused on addressing viral misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm, like misleading health advice. We\u2019ve built specific systems to remove threats such as child exploitation. In countries at risk of conflict, we take down content that could lead to imminent violence or genocide, and we\u2019ve built systems that can detect risks of self-harm within minutes.\n\nThere are diverging views on what people consider dangerous. If someone shares a video of a racist attack, are they condemning it or glorifying it? Are they using normal slang, or using an innocent word in a new way to incite violence? Now multiply those challenges by 100 different languages.\n\nOr take misinformation. No one tells us they want to see misinformation. But people enjoy satire, and they often tell stories that have inaccuracies but speak to a larger truth. Even with a common set of facts, media outlets emphasize different angles. I worry about an erosion of truth, but I don\u2019t think most people want a world where you can share only things that tech companies judge to be 100% true.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. Like the other major internet platforms and most media, Facebook doesn\u2019t fact-check political ads. And if content is newsworthy, we won\u2019t take it down. There are exceptions\u2014even for politicians we don\u2019t allow content if there\u2019s a risk of real-world harm, and we don\u2019t allow voter suppression.\n\nI\u2019ve considered whether we should ban political ads altogether. They are a small part of Facebook\u2019s business and the controversy they create isn\u2019t worth it. But advertising is an important component of free expression. Banning political ads gives an unfair advantage to incumbents and media favorites. It\u2019s also unclear where the line should be drawn. Many ads are about issues, not elections. Would we ban ads about immigration or women\u2019s empowerment? If not, would it really make sense to give everyone but candidates a voice in political debates? There\u2019s no simple answer, and I believe we should err on the side of allowing greater expression.\n\nBut I also believe Facebook shouldn\u2019t be making so many important decisions about speech on its own. That\u2019s why we\u2019re establishing an independent Oversight Board that will make binding decisions on what content stays up and comes down. Neither my team nor I will be able to overturn these decisions. We\u2019re going to appoint members to this board who have a diversity of views and backgrounds, but who each hold free expression as a paramount value.\n\nThe third challenge to expression comes from politics. Some say free speech is dangerous because it may lead to outcomes they find unacceptable. Others believe the stakes are so high that they can no longer trust their fellow citizens with the power to communicate or decide what to believe for themselves.\n\nI believe these views are more dangerous for democracy than any speech could be. You can\u2019t impose tolerance from the top down. It has to come from people opening up, sharing experiences, and developing a common understanding of the society in which they live.\n\nSo how do we turn the tide? Someone once told me the Founders thought free expression was like air\u2014you don\u2019t miss it until it\u2019s gone. I\u2019m more optimistic. I believe in giving people a voice because I believe in people. Progress isn\u2019t linear. Sometimes we take two steps forward and one step back. But if we can\u2019t agree to let each other talk about the issues, we\u2019ll never even take that first step.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg is founder and CEO of Facebook.
