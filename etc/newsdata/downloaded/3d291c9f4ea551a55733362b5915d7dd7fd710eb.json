'But I had a lucky escape, and now Thsawar's behind bars, I can rebuild.'\n\nSarah met her ex-partner on dating website Badoo, and fell for his warm smile. They got talking and were soon meeting up a couple of times a week.\n\nShe learned that he had a troubled past, and had even been to prison, but decided not to press Malik after he refused to talk about it.\n\n'I assumed he had got in with the wrong crowd in his youth and perhaps been caught shoplifting,' she said.\n\nTheir relationship progressed and the couple moved in together. Then one day, he sat her down and made a staggering admission.\n\n'My mind raced. \"He's married\" was my first thought,' Sarah explained.\n\nSarah recalled how in September 2018, Malik snapped her fingers and cracked her skull on a door frame during another vicious attack\n\n'But my stomach lurched when he made his shocking confession - he'd been in prison for stabbing someone and killing them.'\n\nThsawar Malik was convicted of manslaughter and grievous bodily harm in 2009 and handed a 15 year jail term for stabbing two men - killing one of them when the blade penetrated his heart.\n\n'I couldn't believe it,' Sarah said.

'He struggled to find work and, cooped up at home all day, he became irritable and controlling.\n\n'I saw a dark, aggressive side to him I hadn't seen before; the side that had landed him in jail. The side that had killed a man.'\n\nSarah said when Eliza was born in May 2017, it was like 'the missing piece of the puzzle' and 'lit up our lives'. Pictured: Eliza with Malik\n\nOne day, in December 2017, Thsawar flew into an irrational rage and accused Sarah of being unfaithful before raping her. Pictured: her injuries at the hands of Malik\n\nShe told how he would order her to FaceTime him whenever she went out without him, even when visiting her mother, so that he knew she wasn't with someone else.\n\n'With a newborn baby to care for I didn't have time to even think about cheating,' Sarah said.\n\n'But Thsawar became increasingly jealous, convinced I was having an affair.'\n\nOne day, in December 2017, Thsawar flew into an irrational rage and accused Sarah of being unfaithful.\n\nRe-living the horrifying experience, Sarah recalled: 'Terrified, my blood ran cold as I lay down on the bed and clutched little Eliza to my chest. I had to keep her safe.\n\nSarah, pictured now, told how she fought 'tooth and nail' with Malik as he attacked her, but he was too strong and overpowered her\n\n'But Thsawar simply wrenched Eliza away and put her in the cot next to the bed before turning back to me.\n\n'I begged him not to, But Thsawar was like a man possessed and he launched his savage attack.\n\n'He called me a s*** and demanded sex, pushing me down and ripping at my vest. I'll never forget the sick smile on his face as he forced himself on me and raped me.\n\n'I fought tooth and nail to push him off me. I even bit his cheek, but Thsawar was too strong.\n\n'Ruthless and determined, he never stopped laughing as he violated me. It was an evil, cruel cackle - like the Joker in Batman - and afterwards, he simply rolled over and went to sleep.\n\n'Tears streamed down my cheeks as I turned to where Eliza was lying peacefully in her cot, unaware of the horror that was going on around her.'\n\nIn September 2018 Malik launched into a drunken rage and snapped Sarah's fingers before hurling her across the room, where she cracked her head on a door frame\n\nSarah, pictured with Malik, told how her support worker passed her a book on domestic violence, which was like a light switch flicking in her mind\n\nMalik continued to exert control over Sarah and in September 2018, he launched a savage drunken attack, during which he broke her fingers and threw her into a door frame, cracking her skull and broke her fingers.\n\n'That was the moment I knew Thsawar would kill me unless I escaped,' she said.\n\n'He'd killed before - he would do it again, and there was no way I was leaving my children without a mother.'\n\nSarah told how her support worker passed her a book on domestic violence, which was like a light switch flicking in her mind.\n\n'Thsawar was controlling me, punishing me, and yet making me question myself, like the abuse was somehow my fault,' she said.\n\nSarah, pictured now, ordered Malik to leave and threatened to call the police. Stunned at her resolve and strength, he walked out - which is the last time Sarah has seen him\n\n'That night, Thsawar came home and began hurling abuse at me. But this time, I felt a steely resolve I didn't know I had embolden me.'\n\nSarah ordered Malik to leave and threatened to call the police. Stunned at her resolve and strength, he walked out - which is the last time Sarah has seen him.\n\n'A few days later, I went to the police and told them everything,' she said.\n\nMalik was arrested and in April 2019, after pleading guilty to rape and assault, he was jailed for life.\n\n'He broke my fingers and my skull, but not my spirit,' Sarah said.
