I honestly don\u2019t think about stress now, my job is fun, and I enjoy the news cycle. Whenever I feel stressful, I\u2019d wear the other hat of all the ones that I wear, and that helps,\u201d said Mr. Salman Iqbal.\n\nAbout the digital age\u2019s biggest issue\u2014 dealing with fake news\u2014 the CEO ARY Digital Network said that the ARY News team has a number of experienced reporters who usually never fall for fake news.\n\n\u201cReporters who have been there for so many years, we believe whatever say is set in stone. We have reporters who do hundreds of reports a year and have had no rebuttals, so there\u2019s that trust within their skills that we have,\u201d Mr. Salman Iqbal maintained.\n\nThe ARY Films\u2019 Journey\n\nWhen asked about his foray into the film industry, he told the interviewer that in 2013, he had gone to India to sign up a contract with various Indian studios to pick up Bollywood films for Pakistan but despite the fact that the meetings were going smoothly, he decided to invest the same money in Pakistan\u2019s nascent film industry which he eventaully supported with successful films like \u2018Punjab Nahi Jaungi\u2019 and \u2018Jawani Phir Nahi Ani\u2019.\n\n\u201cI called them up at 2 am in the morning and I said I want to get out of the signing ceremony. If I am willing to spend that amount, then why not do it in Pakistan? We need to invest here \u2013 and look at how it\u2019s grown! From 47 screens we have 150 today,\u201d said Salman Iqbal.\n\nHe added that from that day to today, ARY Films\u2019 foray into the industry changed things for the better.\n\nHe was of the view that the local film industry should come out of the drama industry mentality for real growth.\n\nThe man with the success story, however, advised all future investors that one cannot become a successful producer in a single attempt.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just a one-time producer, you can\u2019t succeed. You need to be a factory for producing films,\u201d said Salman Iqbal.\n\nAbout the future of ARY Films, he said that his organisation\u2019s projection is to increase the number of films in Pakistan while also trying to change the genres.\n\n\u201cWe need to venture out of just comedy or romance,\u201d said Salman Iqbal.\n\nARY Digital\u2019s plays \u2018resonate with the masses\u2019\n\nAbout ARY Digital\u2019s journey to becoming Pakistan\u2019s number one entertainment channel, Mr. Salman Iqbal said that the secret behind this success was making dramas and shows that \u201cresonate with the masses\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur biggest mistake in the past was to target the audiences that weren\u2019t even watching our television. When we went into the mainstream, it changed things altogether! After that, about four years ago, our team sat together again and we decided we\u2019ll start finding real-time stories that are usually considered taboo, and make people realise that real-life stories work the best,\u201d said Salman Iqbal.\n\nHe also gave the example of ARY Digital\u2019s massively successful game-show \u201cJeeto Pakistan\u201d to explain how targeting the masses brought in popularity and success.\n\n\u201cWhatever family someone comes from, they want a pass of the show! So, when we target the masses, we resonate them with a lot! These are the people who if you give content, they will love it forever,\u201d CEO ARY Digital Network said.\n\nPSL Plans for Karachi Kings\n\nAbout Karachi Kings and the decision to invest in Pakistan Super League (PSL), Mr. Salman Iqbal said that PSL was one product that he picked \u201cagainst all oppositions\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe spend over a billion rupees on it every season, and it\u2019s literally one of the most expensive movies I have ever made, I look at like a movie! So, we are really keeping our hopes us this time around,\u201d said Salman Iqbal.\n\nHe revealed that for the fifth season of PSL, his team has made some big announcements like the Australian maestro Dean Jones coming in as new coach, and star batsman Babar Azam coming in as the vice-captain now.\n\n\u201cSo, lots of changes and we\u2019re hoping for the best,\u201d the Karachi Kings\u2019 owner said.\n\nMr. Salman Iqbal concluded revealing that his future plan for ARY Digital Network includes diversifying the business.\n\n\u201cWe are venturing into a completely different field of business now, and this is the best time to do it. ARY will see major changes. Another thing that we\u2019re focusing on is harnessing the power of the digital age. We\u2019re coming up with a new portal soon too, which will revolutionize the digital era in Pakistan,\u201d said the President and CEO of ARY Digital Network.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Salman Iqbal talks about the success of ARY Digital and ARY News, his foray into the film-making business and his plans for his PSL team Karachi Kings.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Salman-Iqbal-CEO-ARY-Digital-Network.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
