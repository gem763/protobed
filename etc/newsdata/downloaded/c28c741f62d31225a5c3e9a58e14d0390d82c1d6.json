These products showed possible storm plots well outside the official forecast cone.\"\n\n\"The President's comments were based on that morning's Hurricane Dorian briefing, which included the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama,\" Brown said.\n\nA White House source familiar with the matter said that Trump personally directed Brown to give the statement, according to CNN.\n\nPresident Donald Trump looks at a chart showing potential rainfall totals from Hurricane Florence during a briefing in the Oval Office on September 11, 2018.

We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\"\n\nTrump did not back down from his assertion, saying Alabama had a chance to be hit by Hurricane Dorian, based on maps and models he said he saw. But the \" spaghetti plot\" he provided as evidence on Twitter did not include critical factors that determine a more accurate prediction of the trajectory of the storm's path. It did not include information about wind speeds, and showed the possible routes based on atmospheric conditions and the path of previous storms.\n\nThe plot map Trump revealed also noted on the bottom that \"if anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore this entire product.\"\n\nBrown's statement did not include who had drawn an additional cone to include Alabama on a map Trump presented on Wednesday.\n\nThe White House appeared to stand firm over the controversy, which fueled viral memes of pictures edited with a black marker.\n\nOn Thursday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham fired back at CNN, which extensively covered what is being dubbed as \"Sharpiegate,\" and mocked the network for labeling Alabama as Mississippi on a graphic.\n\n\"Hi @CNN, I know you guys are busy analyzing lines on a map, but perhaps you use your time to study up on US geography,\" Grisham said on Twitter.\n\nCNN's communications team responded by saying it \"made a mistake\" and fixed it \"in less than 30 seconds.\"\n\n\"And now we are admitting it,\" the company said on Twitter. \"You all should try it sometime.\"", "description": "\"I showed the President the official National Hurricane Center forecast,\" US Coast Guard Rear Admiral Peter Brown said in a statement.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7185ab2e22af03424bfee5-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
