Washington, which has a separate trilateral military information-sharing deal with Seoul and Tokyo, has expressed disappointment and concern over the termination of the bilateral Gsomia, often used to share information on North Korea\u2019s missile testing.Stilwell is on a six-country trip, which started last Thursday and runs through Nov. 7. It also takes him to Yangon, Myanmar; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Bangkok; Seoul and Beijing. He last visited Seoul in mid-July, right after the announcement of Japan\u2019s export restrictions.Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met in Tokyo Thursday, the highest-level meeting between the two countries since the forced labor court decision last October, and agreed on the importance of not neglecting relations and of continuing dialogue. However, the two sides were not able to further narrow differences on the key issues straining relations between the two countries.\u201cThe Gsomia issue fundamentally was triggered by Japan\u2019s unfair export restrictions,\u201d Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said in a press conference Thursday. She noted that the issue \u201chasn\u2019t thus far been a topic of in-depth discussion\u201d between the two countries.\u201cWithout a change in [Japan\u2019s] retaliatory measures, it will be difficult to withdraw the Gsomia decision,\u201d a senior Korean Foreign Ministry official told reporters in Seoul Friday, adding this will neither be logical nor acceptable to the Korean people.However, the official pointed out it will be difficult to reach an agreement in less than a month as Japan is demanding that forced labor issues be resolved before export restrictions are lifted.\u201cWhile officially Japan denies a connection [between the export restrictions and the forced labor issue], they will demand a resolution to the forced labor issue before withdrawing the retaliatory measures,\u201d the official said.Japan claims that the 1965 treaty normalizing relations with Korea, which provided for an economic cooperation fund, settled all compensation matters, while Seoul maintains it cannot interfere in court rulings, citing separation of powers.Hiroshi Kajiyama, the new Japanese minister of economy, trade and industry, insisted Saturday in his first press conference that the trade restrictions \u201cdid not violate\u201d World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations. His remarks indicate that Japan is not planning to budge from its implementation of export restrictions on Korea.Seoul in September filed a complaint with the WTO over Tokyo\u2019s export restrictions.Kajiyama, who previously served as minister in charge of revitalizing local economies, was named by Abe to take over the Trade Ministry, which spearheads the export restrictions. Isshu Sugawara, former trade minister, resigned Friday after just 44 days following accusations of election law violations.BY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/27210005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
