In other words, you make a good policy, and reverse in the next sentence,\" Motsaeledi told Moneyweb.\n\n\"So we have given the instruction that, look, it\u2019s no longer wanted. You don\u2019t have to carry it, you don\u2019t have to produce it. The argument from Home Affairs was that it was to stop child-trafficking. Then we said no, no let\u2019s not trouble tourists with this. Let\u2019s find our own way of fighting child-trafficking, rather than using this method, which interferes with tourism. There ought to be another method to fight child-trafficking, and so that\u2019s where we are at the moment.\"\n\nThis confirmation has been welcomed by CEO of Cape Town Tourism Enver Duminy, as there's still been some confusion.\n\nALSO SEE: Namibia to reinforce UBC rules just as they're scrapped for SA\n\n\"What is key at this point is that this new directive is clearly communicated to officials at ports of entry to ensure the confusion around what is and isn't required from visitors is a thing of the past. More than anything, this confusion and mixed messaging has been a significant, if unknown, cost to tourism to South Africa.\n\nThe unabridged birth certificate had been an ongoing saga for three years, which has caused many problems for travellers to South Africa and the tourism industry.\n\nFOR FAMILIES: New passports rules for SA minors: How to apply for your child's passport\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
