The government doesn't even respect the dead Ridvan Ayhan\n\nConstruction work on the dam and its hydroelectric power plant started in 2006 and Hasankeyf is now just weeks away from destruction, despite a fight by residents and environmental campaigners to save it. The Turkish government has given residents until 8 October to evacuate.\n\nAn attempt to challenge the project at the European court of human rights on the grounds that it would damage the country\u2019s cultural heritage was unsuccessful.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A photo of the old university of Hasankeyf \u2013 said to have been the oldest in the world \u2013 before it was destroyed in January 2019 ahead of the flooding.

On its completion it will be the fourth biggest dam in Turkey and is predicted to generate 4,200 gigawatts of electricity annually, but at a huge cost.\n\nThe scheme will mean the flooding of 199 settlements in the region, thousands of human-made caves and hundreds of historical and religious sites. Campaigners warn that close to 80,000 people will be displaced.\n\nThey also warn of terrible damage to the natural environment, saying biodiversity will suffer, and that numerous vulnerable and endangered species are threatened by the construction of the dam.\n\nRidvan Ayhan, who was born in one of the caves in Hasankeyf, is an active member in the Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive, founded in 2006 as a grassroots campaign to halt the dam project.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ridvan Ayhan, now nearly 60, of the Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive. He was born in one of Hasankeyf\u2019s caves.

Only 10% of the area has been explored by archaeologists.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked for the area to be an open-air museum but the government wouldn\u2019t accept it,\u201d Ayhan said. \u201cIf you dig here you will find cultures layered on top of one another.\u201d\n\nUnder the church is a tomb where piles of human bones have surfaced. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t even respect the dead,\u201d Ayhan said. \u201cThey are barbaric.\u201d\n\nHasankeyf has been part of many different cultures in its long history, including ancient Mesopotamia, Byzantium, Arab empires and the Ottoman empire, but Hakan Ozoglu, a history professor at the University of Central Florida, said the settlement predates all these civilisations.\n\n\u201cWe have references to the town in several ancient texts in different languages such as Assyrian, Armenian, Kurdish, Arabic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe professor says Hasankeyf is a laboratory that could provide many answers about the past. \u201cSuch rare physical evidence of the human past must be protected at all cost,\u201d Ozoglu said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Many residents of Hasankeyf still live in caves. Photograph: Tessa Fox/The Guardian\n\nOnly eight historical monuments \u2013 including a tower from what was said to be the oldest university in the world, half of an old Roman gate to the city and a women\u2019s hamam dating to around 1400 \u2013 have been saved from Hasankeyf. The pieces were moved 3km away and now stand on a vast plain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s meaningless for us to see these historical pieces there,\u201d Ayhan said.\n\nWith the deadline handed down by the government, people from the surrounding areas have come to say farewell to the historical site, knowing it will be their last chance to see it.\n\nFew tourists visit the area, however, due to its inaccessibility.\n\nOzoglu said the benefit from the dam cannot come close to that of the potential of tourism that would be better marketed if it had Unesco\u2019s name attached to it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A 1,000-tonne tomb from the 15th century that was moved from its place in Hasankeyf village to stand alone near the new settlement.

If there was democracy, maybe we could do something.\u201d He says he was arrested in 2012.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The government has only built 700 new homes for the \u201cnew Hasankeyf\u201d, even though the population of the village has risen substantially since 1974, when the figure of 700 households was taken. Photograph: Tessa Fox/The Guardian\n\nThe government has built a \u201cnew Hasankeyf\u201d for 700 households, 3km away from historical Hasankeyf, to relocate residents before 8 October. But Eyup Agalday, 27, said he and his wife were not offered their own home in the new settlement, as the government has a cutoff for those married after 2014. \u201cI will have to live with my parents again\u2013 the whole family of 10 members will be in the one house,\u201d he said.\n\nAgalday, like his ancestors, is a shepherd, and currently lives in in one of Hasankeyf\u2019s many caves. He will not be allowed to take his animals to the new village and has started selling his goats. \u201cI am forced to do something and be in a city where I don\u2019t want to live,\u201d he said.\n\nAgalday said about a fifth of Hasankeyf\u2019s residents have already moved to the new settlement, with around five or six families moving each day.
