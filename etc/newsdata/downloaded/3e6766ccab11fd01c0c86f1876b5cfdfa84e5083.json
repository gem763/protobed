I support their vision and I absolutely support Mr Thanathorn,\" Punjarat Wattawongvibul, 35, told AFP outside the court.\n\nThe highly-interventionist court disbanded a different anti-military opposition party linked to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra just before the March election.\n\nThanathorn has also been singled out by the kingdom's powerful army chief.\n\nGeneral Apirat Kongsompong last week delivered a diatribe warning of the spectre of a communist rebellion in a speech peppered with barely-concealed references to Thanathorn and his party.\n\nFuture Forward has been a rare voice of criticism against Thailand's royalist establishment.\n\nThe monarchy, one of the world's richest and headed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, is at the apex of Thai power.\n\nOn Thursday 70 Future Forward MPs voted against a royal decree transferring two key army units to the direct control of the king -- an unprecedented political objection to a royal command.\n\nThe decree was still approved in parliament with an overwhelming majority.", "description": "Battery of legal woes threatens electoral success of popular politician seen as threat to ruling military bloc.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/e21ef26984a0498fb43cc8f4168f136b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
