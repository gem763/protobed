Lee would violate a state law protecting war memorials, The Daily Progress reported.\n\nMoore issued a permanent injunction to prevent the removal of both Lee\u2019s statue and also a separate monument to Confederate general Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson which city leaders had also hoped to take down.\n\nThe ruling marks the near-end of a lawsuit that has dragged through the courts for more than two years.\n\nThe statue of Confederate general Robert E.

A few months later, white nationalists held a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in the city, in part to protest the removal of Lee\u2019s statue.\n\nThe demonstration turned deadly when a white supremacist drove his car into a group of counter-protesters. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed in the attack and dozens of others were injured.\n\nIn the aftermath of the rally, black shrouds were used to cover the two statues but Moore ordered the coverings removed in 2018.\n\nThe judge argued at the time that any possible harm that could be caused by removing the tarps was outweighed by the damage that could be inflicted on the public \u201cin not being able to view or enjoy\u201d the statues.\n\nRuling against the city again on Friday, Moore said the monuments could not be removed, disturbed or encroached upon because they were protected under the state\u2019s historic preservation law.", "description": "Virginia Judge Richard Moore said the statues of Confederate generals Robert E.
