Experts say the hole is usually around 8 million square miles during this time of year.\n\nPaul Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said it is 'great news for ozone in the Southern Hemisphere'.\n\nBut he warned: 'It's important to recognize that what we're seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures. It's not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery.'\n\nBetween September and October, the hole shrunk to around 3.9 million square miles (10 million square kilometres) \u2014 the lowest size at which it has ever been recorded\n\nObservations by NASA and NOAA found that the hole reached its peak dimensions for the year at 6.3 million square miles on September 8\n\nBy early October the ozone hole can be seen to have shrunk to around 3.9 million square miles. The Dobson Unit can be seen on the left, measuring the amount of a trace gas in a vertical column through the Earth's atmosphere\n\nThe hole in the ozone was at its largest in September 2006, when it covered a massive 10.6million square miles\n\nWHAT IS THE OZONE LAYER? Ozone is a molecule comprised of three oxygen atoms that occurs naturally in small amounts. In the stratosphere, roughly seven to 25 miles above Earth's surface, the ozone layer acts like sunscreen, shielding the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation. It is produced in tropical latitudes and distributed around the globe. Closer to the ground, ozone can also be created by photochemical reactions between the sun and pollution from vehicle emissions and other sources, forming harmful smog. In the 1970s, it was recognised that chemicals called CFCs, used for example in refrigeration and aerosols, were destroying ozone in the stratosphere. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was agreed, which led to the phase-out of CFCs and, recently, the first signs of recovery of the Antarctic ozone layer. At lower latitudes, the upper stratosphere is also showing clear signs of recovery, suggesting the Montreal Protocol is working well.\n\nAccording to NASA, the 'main ingredient' in the ozone-destroying process is are so-called polar stratospheric clouds.\n\nThese relatively rare bodies occur high in the stratosphere at altitudes between 49,000\u201382,000 feet (15,000\u201325,000 metres) above the surface.\n\nThese clouds provide a surface on which chemical reactions can occur \u2014 releasing waste products called 'free radicals' which go on to destroy ozone particles around them.\n\nFewer polar stratospheric clouds form in warmer weather, however, and they also last for shorter periods of time in such conditions.\n\nThis year's warmer global temperatures \u2014 aided by unusual weather patterns \u2014 have therefore helped to limit the development of these clouds and also given those did form less time to damage the ozone layer.\n\nIn turn, this has led to a much smaller ozone hole this year than we have previously seen.\n\nOn the surface, the strengthening of the ozone layer would seem to be a promising development \u2014 as such serves to better protect the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.\n\nHowever, the news that the hole is shrinking is not necessarily a good sign \u2014 as the process that is closing the hole is a clear product of rising global temperatures.\n\nIn years with more typical weather, the hole usually reaches a maximum size of about 8million square miles by late September or early October \u2014 before shrinking back down again.\n\nGases released from man-made processes on Earth are eroding away the layer of ozone gas which surrounds the globe. Holes in the layer mean more heat from the Sun makes it through and down to Earth level, which is warming the surface and oceans\n\nThe highly reactive ozone molecule \u2014 also known as trioxygen \u2014 comprises three oxygen atoms and is a pale blue gas with a pungent smell.\n\nIt can be found 25 miles above the Earth's surface, in the stratosphere.\n\nBy reacting with high-energy, ultraviolet rays the ozone acts like a layer of sun screen \u2014 absorbing the harmful rays in the stratosphere before they reach Earth's surface.\n\nOzone is created primarily by ultraviolet radiation, when high-energy ultraviolet rays strike ordinary oxygen molecules (O2).\n\nThis splits the molecule into two single oxygen atoms \u2014 dubbed 'atomic oxygen' \u2014 with the freed oxygen atoms going on to combine with regular oxygen molecules to form ozone (O3).\n\nThis reaction helps shield the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer, cataracts, suppress immune systems and also damage plants.\n\nThe ozone depletion seen in blue growing over the month of August 2019, pictured in August 7 (left) and August 27\n\nThe Antarctic ozone 'hole', which is technically not a hole but an area of depletion, forms during the Southern Hemisphere's late winter as the returning Sun's rays start ozone-depleting reactions.\n\nThese runaway reactions involve chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine derived from man-made compounds and take place on the surfaces of cloud particles in cold stratospheric layers \u2014 breaking up ozone molecules.\n\nWarmer temperatures mean fewer polar stratospheric clouds form, limiting the ozone-depletion that can take place on their surface.\n\nNASA and NOAA monitor the ozone hole using satellites including NASA's Aura satellite, the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite and NOAA's Joint Polar Satellite System NOAA-20 satellite.\n\nAt the South Pole, NOAA staff launch weather balloons carrying ozone-measuring 'sondes' which directly sample ozone levels vertically through the atmosphere.\n\nThe flight path of an ozonesonde as it rises into the atmosphere over the South Pole from the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.

Time-lapse photo taken Sept. 9, 2019\n\nMost years, at least some levels of the stratosphere \u2014the region of the upper atmosphere where the largest amounts of ozone are normally found \u2014 are completely devoid of ozone.\n\nBryan Johnson at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado said: 'This year, ozonesonde measurements at the South Pole did not show any portions of the atmosphere where ozone was completely depleted.'\n\nWhile this is uncommon, it is not unprecedented. This is the third time in the last 40 years that weather systems have caused warm temperatures that limit ozone depletion, said Susan Strahan, an atmospheric scientist with Universities Space Research Association, who works at NASA Goddard.\n\nThe polar solar vortex seen in red over the south pole which was unusually 'wonky' this year\n\nSimilar weather patterns in the Antarctic stratosphere in September 1988 and 2002 also produced atypically small ozone holes, she said.\n\nDr Strahan said: 'It's a rare event that we're still trying to understand. If the warming hadn't happened, we'd likely be looking at a much more typical ozone hole.'\n\nThere is no identified connection between the occurrence of these unique patterns and changes in climate.\n\nThe weather systems that disrupted the 2019 ozone hole are typically modest in September, but this year they were unusually strong, dramatically warming the Antarctic's stratosphere during the pivotal time for ozone destruction.\n\nAt an altitude of about 12 miles (20 kilometers), temperatures during September were 29F (16\u02daC) warmer than average, the warmest in the 40-year historical record for September by a wide margin.\n\nIn addition, these weather systems also weakened the Antarctic polar vortex, knocking it off its normal center over the South Pole and reducing the strong September jet stream around Antarctica from a mean speed of 161 miles per hour to a speed of 67 miles per hour.\n\nThis slowing vortex rotation allowed air to sink in the lower stratosphere where ozone depletion occurs, meaning the Antarctic lower stratosphere was warmed - limiting polar stratospheric clouds where the ozone destroying reactions take place.\n\nThe strong weather systems also brought ozone-rich air from higher latitudes elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere to the area above the Antarctic ozone hole.\n\nA combination of these two effects led to much higher than normal ozone levels over Antarctica compared to ozone hole conditions usually present since the mid 1980s.\n\nAs of October 16, the ozone hole above Antarctica remained small but stable and is expected to gradually dissipate in the coming weeks.", "description": "Warmer temperatures globally and abnormal weather patterns over Antarctica have seen the depletion of ozone halt this year with the ozone hole at its smallest ever size of 3.9 million sq/m.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/09/20025444-0-image-a-28_1571732739523.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
