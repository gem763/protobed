It's gone on to sell 14.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nAnd now, the moment the of the beast's first meeting with Mouse in the woods will feature on a coin of the realm.\n\nNicola Howell, director of consumer at the Royal Mint said: \"Following the fantastic response to the Gruffalo's debut appearance on a 50p coin to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the book, we are delighted to introduce an additional coin capturing Mouse and Gruffalo's first meeting, continuing the story of one of the world's most favourite literary monsters on UK coins.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram/changechecker)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe new coin, produced by the Royal Mint, will not be entering general circulation but is available to buy from its website.\n\nThe Mint has already produced another Gruffalo 50p, launched earlier this year and showing the Gruffalo alone.\n\nDonaldson, said: \"The launch of the first Gruffalo coins in February was a great 20th birthday present for him, and the issue of a second collectable 50p coin in the same year feels like the icing on his birthday cake.\"\n\nScheffler, said: \"Having never imagined that the Gruffalo would appear on a coin, it is great that we have two coins in the 20th year of the book.\n\n\"A love of the story unites children across the world and I hope that they will be able to cherish these stories for a long time.\"\n\n(Image: Royal Mint)\n\nThis is not the first time a celebrated children's character has been used for a coin. Recent editions include the Beatrix Potter character collection, Paddington, the friendly Peruvian bear and the Christmas favourite, The Snowman.\n\nAnd some of them have gone on to sell for far more than their original price.\n\nThe Snowman 50ps were in such high demand that they were selling for \u00a3103 just weeks after launch , while the original Beatrix Potter 50p coins are still exchanging hands for more than \u00a3504 online .\n\nHowever, not everything has done as well - with the Paddington Bear 50ps available for about 99p online and the Mrs Tiggy-Winkle Beatrix Potter 50p currently available for, well, 50p.\n\nPrices for the new Gruffalo 50ps start from \u00a310 for the uncirculated coin, \u00a365 for the silver proof coin, and \u00a3980 for the gold coin, which weighs 15.50g, with only 600 available for purchase, the rarest of the three.\n\nAs a commemorative coin it won't be entering general circulation, so if you want one you'll need to head to www.royalmint.com", "description": "The moment the clever mouse meets the terrible beast with orange eyes and purple prickles is now available as a 50p", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Instagram Changechecker", "Pa", "Royal Mint"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article5739072.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/The-Gruffalo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
