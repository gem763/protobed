Scott Applewhite/AP Photo congress Schumer demands hearings, subpoena over whistleblower complaint\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents.\n\nIn a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress \"as required by law.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSchumer demands \"the Senate Republican majority take immediate action to stop President Trump from withholding an Intelligence Community whistleblower complaint that by law must be transmitted to Congress, and to begin an investigation into the administration\u2019s handling of security assistance to Ukraine,\" the letter reads. \"The Republican-led Senate has remained silent and submissive, shying away from this institution\u2019s constitutional obligation to conduct oversight.\"\n\nSchumer also requests that McConnell lean on the White House to identify any administration officials who delayed $250 million in aid to Ukraine earlier this year and release a transcript of Trump's July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"during which President Trump reportedly pressured the government of Ukraine to investigate Vice President Biden and his family,\" as Schumer put it. The Wall Street Journal reported Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky about Biden's son.\n\nTrump told reporters on Sunday that he warned the Ukrainian president about corruption in his country and that \"we don't want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son [Hunter], creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\" Trump has suggested he may release more information about his conversation with Zelensky, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said on Monday's Hugh Hewitt Show that Trump is \"going to blow you away with his willingness to disclose and be transparent about this phone call.\"\n\n", "description": "\"The Republican-led Senate has remained silent and submissive,\" Schumer says.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/09/ae/a12ebae7468cb7c8f19a5a1b4fad/190923-chuck-schumer-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
