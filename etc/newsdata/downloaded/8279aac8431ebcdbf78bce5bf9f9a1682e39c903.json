(AP) - Christian Pulisic said he won\u2019t let his benching with Chelsea affect his play for the U.S. national team as it prepares for a match against Cuba, pronouncing himself in peak form despite scant playing time of late.\n\n\u201cI feel the best I ever have. I feel very confident in my game. I\u2019m not going to let any of that affect me,\u201d Pulisic said Wednesday before training with the national team at George Mason University, where both of his parents played college soccer. \u201cI feel very strong, and I\u2019m really looking forward to this game Friday.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old midfielder has been mostly a spectator in his first season in the Premier League, limited to two appearances since August: a League Cup start against fourth-tier Grimsby Town on Sept. 25 and a 10-minute substitute stint versus Southampton in the EPL on Sunday during which he contributed an assist. Pulisic arrived at Chelsea in the offseason for $73 million from Borussia Dortmund.\n\nPulisic has previously voiced frustration with his playing time under Chelsea manager Frank Lampard but declined to elaborate on those feelings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here now to be focused with the U.S. national team, so that\u2019s really all that\u2019s on my mind right now,\u201d Pulisic said.\n\nThe United States will play Cuba on Friday in Washington and then visit Canada in Toronto on Tuesday, its opening two matches of the CONCACAF Nations League.\n\nWhile he\u2019s been a role player with Chelsea, Pulisic is the undisputed star of the rebuilding U.S. team, which is trying to recover from its failure to qualify for last year\u2019s World Cup in Russia. He said he\u2019s looking forward to seeing what 18-year-old midfielder Brenden Aaronson, who was added to the roster last week, can bring to the squad.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to play with these younger guys,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cHe\u2019s younger than me, right? Yeah, he\u2019s much younger. \u2026 I don\u2019t see myself as young anymore, but whatever.\u201d\n\nFor this week of practice, Pulisic will be in the shadow of his mother, Kelley, and his father, Mark.\n\n\u201cMy dad texted me after the first training. He\u2019s like, \u2018I scored 38 goals on this training field, and your mom scored 10,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cIt\u2019s great, it\u2019s cool to see where they used to play. I haven\u2019t really been here, so it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Christian Pulisic said he won't let his benching with Chelsea affect his play for the U.S. national team as it prepares for a match against Cuba, pronouncing himself in peak form despite scant playing time of late.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ben Nuckols"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/england_weekend_watch_68142_c0-192-3689-2342_s1770x1032.jpg?4832d5be1a248e75666173e44b63fce75c49281c", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
