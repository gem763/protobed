Their first try, scheduled for Bellator 225 in August, fell through when the athletic commission pulled Ayala from the contest.\n\nMinakov instead faced American Timothy Johnson and knocked him out inside one round to take his stellar career record to 22-1.\n\nHopes were high that Minakov and Ayala would face off at the second attempt this weekend at Bellator 232, with many believing another stoppage win for the Russian would book him into a title fight with two-division champion Ryan Bader.\n\nBut now that prospect will have to wait a little longer as Bellator officials debate where to book Minakov for his next fight.\n\nThe event itself will move on, with Bellator welterweight champion Rory MacDonald taking on two-time former champion Douglas Lima in the $1 million Bellator welterweight grand prix final in the night's main event.", "description": "Former Bellator heavyweight champion Vitaly Minakov's latest fight has been scrapped after the Russian star was unable to secure a visa with US immigration officials in time for his main card matchup at Bellator 232.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db057872030277ca858d736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
