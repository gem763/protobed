But those in power are showing signs of acceptance\n\nDoreen Auciello, 63, was finishing a continental breakfast in a hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida \u2013 home of the famous speedway races.\n\nAs she sat with her good friend Gene, who recently lost her husband, their conversation and that of everyone else in the room revolved around Hurricane Dorian, just offshore.\n\nFloridians are used to dealing with hurricane season. It\u2019s hard to deny that the storms are getting stronger, although there is plenty of disagreement as to why.\n\nScientists have been warning that warmer ocean temperatures and higher sea levels are expected to intensify the hurricanes\u2019 impacts.\n\nAuciello is retired and lives alone. Her 1967 vintage mobile home, which she bought for $8,000, is all she owns. She knows it could suffer damage and she has no insurance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hurricane preparations in Daytona Beach.

Until you\u2019ve gone through a major hurricane, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s really like here,\u201d she said.\n\nShe accepts the facts of the climate crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the same as the years go by, all of these storms are just getting worse and worse. Nobody is really taking it seriously and it\u2019s way too late now. You can\u2019t reverse it \u2013 the damage, you know.\u201d\n\nAuciello had lined herself up a coffee, an orange juice and a strawberry smoothie to get through the day.\n\nRegardless of the widespread news coverage of how vulnerable the state is to storm damage, the dream endures: it\u2019s estimated that more than 900 people move to Florida every day.\n\nDorian\u2019s eye was approaching Daytona Beach on Wednesday but the Carolinas now expect the brunt of the storm.\n\nHurricane Dorian hammers the Bahamas \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nStacy Givens, a Daytona local, believes God is trying to tell us something. \u201cHe\u2019s shaking up the world,\u201d she exclaimed, as rather terrifying waves surged up to the sea wall. Rather than a climate crisis spurred by human action, Givens thinks the increasingly frequent monster hurricanes are all part of a divine plan.\n\nMany residents on the adjacent barrier island decided not to evacuate. \u201c[The hurricanes] are what they are, they\u2019re going to come whether I\u2019m here or not. I can\u2019t afford to move anyplace else,\u201d said 52-year-old Jim Bordain. He came to the beach to look for any special washed-up shells, which, he said, appear every time a hurricane comes.\n\nLike those of many Floridians, his views on climate science can best be described as conspiratorial. \u201cOrganizations that want to have control over other people are trying to make more out of the global warming so that they can dictate how business is run and how we use our vehicles,\u201d Bordain explained.\n\nFlorida is a transient place. People often come to escape their past lives or to seek a comfortable retirement.\n\nJames Bagwell, 41, has lived in Daytona Beach since 2011. He remodels homes and is struggling financially with being out of work for five days. He thought Dorian was \u201ctaking too long\u201d to play out.\n\nAs the storm paused, catastrophically, over the Bahamas on Labor Day, nerves were fraying in north-east Florida.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police prevent access to the barrier island at Daytona Beach as Dorian approaches. Photograph: Niall Macaulay/Niall Macaulay for the Guardian\n\n\u201cI have a little bit of money set aside for emergencies, but not enough for more than five days,\u201d Bagwell said.\n\nHe sees this extreme weather as part of the cycle of life. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nature. If you look at the dinosaurs, they were wiped out by something,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s close to the time for humans to be wiped out by something and start the next evolutionary ladder.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), five of the 10 strongest Atlantic storms have occurred in the last 10 years. Yet many citizens of Florida are confused when it comes to the origins of hurricanes, and how the human-caused climate crisis is steadily making them more dangerous.\n\nFlorida has a long political history of climate science denial, which culminated in the former governor Rick Scott, now a US senator, allegedly banning the words \u201cclimate change\u201d from any internal government communications. Scott is evolving, however.\n\nNow, an unwelcome serving of reality is being delivered to those in power, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly hard to sustain the delusion. The Florida senator Marco Rubio, a sharp skeptic in the past, has called recommended actions in scientific reports are \u201calarmism\u201d but now admits that climate change is a \u201creal problem\u201d.\n\nAs a result of these policymakers and their predecessors, the Sunshine state still gets far more of its power from burning coal and natural gas than from renewables, and mass transit systems have struggled to gain traction.\n\nBut the ever-stronger hurricanes and rising seas affect everyone, regardless of political persuasion, so the center ground of the discussion is finally shifting, forcing even science deniers to make statements acknowledging global heating is happening.\n\nThe recently elected Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has hired the state\u2019s first chief resilience officer. Her job is to \u201cprepare Florida for the environmental, physical and economic impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise\u201d.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Despite the hurricane, local residents question scientists\u2019 conclusions.
