REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\n\nSEATTLE (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has bought technology startup INLT for an undisclosed amount, the company told Reuters on Tuesday, in a transaction that will help merchants on its online marketplace more easily import goods into the United States.\n\nThe firm, with around a dozen employees based in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, makes software for sellers to manage costs and customs clearance of cross-border shipments. Seattle-based Amazon said it will offer INLT\u2019s cloud-based computing technology to its merchants.\n\n\u201cINLT is a smart, nimble team that is helping companies simplify and lower the cost of importing goods into the U.S.,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with them to develop the next generation of solutions for their customers and Amazon selling partners.\u201d\n\nAmazon is looking to expand the services it offers merchants to add tools for complicated cross-border sales processes, which sellers largely needed to manage on their own.\n\nThe timing and pricing of the INLT service is yet to be announced.\n\nINLT said on its website that Amazon had acquired the company. Amazon, which has already closed the deal, said INLT will continue to serve its existing customers.\n\nAmazon declined to disclose how much it paid for INLT.
