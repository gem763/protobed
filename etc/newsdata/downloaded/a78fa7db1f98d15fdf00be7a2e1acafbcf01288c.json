That\u2019s why it\u2019s especially odd that the GOP\u2019s newest drug pricing bill is a watered-down copy of one of Pelosi\u2019s very worst big government ideas.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Speaker Pelosi introduced H.R. 3, a drug pricing bill that would install what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called \u201csocialist price controls\u201d on most Medicare and Medicaid prescriptions. H.R. 3 would cause the price of certain drugs to soar, reduce the availability of many prescriptions, and dry up investment in innovative, life-saving drugs.\n\n\n\nRepublicans on the Senate Finance Committee responded to Pelosi with their own, competing legislation. The GOP drug pricing plan would install an inflation penalty that functions, according to Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), as socialist \u201cprice controls\u201d on Medicare medicines. And just like the House Democrats\u2019 drug pricing plan, the Republicans version would cause the price of certain drugs to soar, reduce the availability of many prescriptions, and dry up investment in innovative, life-saving drugs.\n\n\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s not a dime\u2019s worth of difference between the Democrats\u2019 troubling drug pricing scheme and the Republican alternative.\n\n\n\nPelosi\u2019s H.R. 3 would cap the price of prescriptions at 120% of the average price of the drug in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Since all six of the countries operate socialized medicine programs that allow the government to manipulate prices and subsidize costs with taxpayers\u2019 money, drug prices have little relationship to actual cost or value of the medicines.\n\n\n\nPrice controls on medicines have had devastating consequences in the countries Pelosi wants to emulate.\n\n\n\nOf 220 new drugs launched from 2011 to 2017, 90% were available in the United States. Just two-thirds were available to patients in the UK, only half were offered in Canada and France, and a paltry one-third were available in Australia.\n\n\n\nEven when drugs are made available for sale in these countries, shortages are common. In France, a quarter of patients have been unable to get their prescriptions because of drug shortages. Last year, Canada\u2019s government reported 4,400 drug shortages. Critical drugs for treating cancer, seizures and diabetes were nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\nMedical innovation has also dried up in these countries. The portion of new medicines originating from the UK, France and Germany has been slashed in half over the past 40 years, as European drug makers flee regulations and price controls for greener pastures in the United States.\n\n\n\nTo make Pelosi\u2019s terrible plan even worse, if a drugmaker refuses to allow the government to limit the prices of a medication, the feds slap a 95% tax on the drug. The tax could apply to nearly all of the most popular prescriptions in America \u2013 drastically raising the price Americans pay for vital medicines.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the Senate Republicans\u2019 alternative drug pricing plan is plagued with many of the same problems as Pelosi\u2019s proposal.\n\n\n\nEven though Republicans call their price control scheme an \u201cinflation penalty,\u201d it functions the same as Pelosi\u2019s socialist price cap. Under the GOP bill, if a drug price increases beyond the rate of inflation, the manufacturer has to pay a fine to the federal government equal to that cost hike.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Senate Republicans\u2019 price cap, they also want force drug manufacturers to pay 20% of seniors\u2019 prescription costs once an individual\u2019s out-of-pocket-costs reaches a certain amount \u2013 about $3,100 annually if the GOP gets its way.\n\n\n\nThe price caps, taxes, penalties and payments the House Democrats and Senate Republicans want won\u2019t do much to actually lower costs to patients, but they will almost certainly cause Americans to die. That\u2019s because these \u201csolutions\u201d all remove the incentive for drug manufacturers to invest money into R&D.\n\n\n\nIt costs an average of $2.6 billion to bring a new drug to market, according to a Tufts University study. Under both proposals being floated in Congress, manufacturers would find it almost impossible to recoup their investment in developing new medicines. Not only would incentives to create groundbreaking, life-saving medicines vanish, competition that lowers the price of drugs would dry up as well.\n\n\n\nAs Republicans head into the 2020 elections, many Americans are starving for free market health care solutions \u2013 not more socialist schemes that reduce options, make medications harder to find and threaten the future of life-saving new drugs.\n\nSenate Republicans should scrap their rip-off of the Democrats\u2019 prescription proposal and do more to differentiate themselves from Speaker Pelosi\u2019s big government drug pricing plan.\n\nDrew Johnson is a senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research.", "description": "Since Nancy Pelosi first became Speaker of the House in .09/28/2019 6:16:36AM EST.", "authors": ["Drew Johnson", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/155/0ef8f36d-b2d2-449b-89c5-6684fdf8bcbb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
