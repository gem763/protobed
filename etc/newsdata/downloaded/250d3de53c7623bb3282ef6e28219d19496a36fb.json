What matters is that for eight years, anger boiled, then simmered, then stuck in that impossible-to scrub-off way inside of Spille. He carried it with him wherever he went.\n\n\u201cIt was always in the back of my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was just eating away at me.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s just call what happened \u201cthe incident\u201d. Before \u201cthe incident,\u201d he and Surber graduated from the same high school, shared the same circle of friends and saw each other often, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. Spille would walk into a bar and there would be Surber. Surber would walk into Walmart and there would be Spille.\n\nAfter \u201cthe incident\u201d, Spille says the two never ran into each other. He\u2019s not sure how that\u2019s even possible in a small town like Winchester, Virginia, but he knows himself well enough to describe that as a good thing.\n\n\u201cI was ready to fight at any moment or do whatever it took,\u201d he says.\n\nMany smart, much-debated ideas exist on how we should address the nation\u2019s gun violence problem. They can be found in academic studies, and in state and federal legislation that has passed and failed. They can be found on the signs of March for Our Lives protesters and on the lips of people who have lost children, parents and parts of their own bodies to gunshot blasts.\n\nThey can also be found on a grassy lot located more than an hour and a half from Washington. If you arrive at the right time on the right weekend each month, you\u2019ll find a group of people who say they have found a way to fight gun violence that has nothing to do with studies, laws or protests.\n\nTheir solution, they will tell you, is much simpler: let two people with a grudge pummel each other.\n\n\u201cI know that it probably sounds ridiculous from the outside,\u201d Chris Wilmore says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. But I can tell you that I have solved beefs with guys I hated before I fought them, and now we talk regularly.\u201d\n\nWilmore, who is called \u201cScarface\u201d and sometimes just \u201cFace\u201d, created the fight club \u201cStreetbeefs\u201d in his Harrisonburg backyard in 2008. His goal at that time was to provide a safe place for people in his community to settle disputes. Like him, many of the club\u2019s first members had criminal records and were aware of what could happen if they took their fights to the streets. The club\u2019s motto is \u201cGuns down, Gloves up\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone dying and we don\u2019t want anyone going to jail,\u201d Wilmore says. \u201cWhat we do is make them give their word that if this fight doesn\u2019t solve it, they have to come back.\u201d\n\nHe says he has seen men fight over borrowed money that wasn\u2019t paid back, a lent car that was returned damaged, a woman, a tree stand, a tip given to a probation officer about someone\u2019s marijuana habit. One dispute got so out of hand, he says, the men tried to run each other off the road.\n\n\u201cI was stabbed in my throat in a street dispute years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cYou may think your dispute is petty. I\u2019ve seen people die over petty.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the club has grown in popularity. Videos of its fights are now watched by people in other states and countries, and they sometimes come to participate.\n\nOn a recent weekend, men travelled from California, Oklahoma and the Netherlands to gather in the bare-bones backyard of one of Wilmore\u2019s friends. There, they stepped into a ring made from a chain-link fence and black-painted plywood bearing the scrawled names of other fighters: Iraqi Assassin, Russian Bear, Vandal.\n\nMost of the people who fought that day simply wanted to test their skills.\n\nSpille and Surber were there for another reason. They had come to settle their beef.\n\nSpille and Surber had both recently started going to Neutral Corner Boxing, which was owned by a mutual friend, and Spille realised that made it more likely they would run into each other. He figured it was finally time to address what they hadn\u2019t. Through their friend, he invited Surber to fight him at the Streetbeefs event.\n\nEach fight consists of three, two-minute rounds. That\u2019s six minutes of contact. It seemed a small amount of time to accomplish something as big as extinguishing eight years of anger.\n\nI had my doubts. I shared them with Wilmore a few days before the fight. He told me that 90 per cent of the beef fights he has seen haven\u2019t gone beyond the ring. The club\u2019s success rate is also skewed by the few women who have fought. \u201cThose are the ones that for some reason never get solved,\u201d Wilmore says.\n\nThe club, he points out, has also settled beefs that never turned into fights.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re also part therapist?\u201d I ask him.\n\n\u201cI guess, a ghetto therapist,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s just cause I can relate to them. A lot of these guys come from broken homes, and feel like no one is there for them.\u201d\n\nOn the day that Spille and Surber step into the ring, Wilmore stands between them. The men are an even match, with both measuring 6 feet tall and about 190 pounds. For their fighting names, they chose \u201cCaterpillar\u201d and \u201cChuck D\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen this is over, it\u2019s over, man,\u201d Wilmore tells them. \u201cNo matter what happens, you leave this s**t here, in the yard, all right?\u201d\n\nThe men nod and then tap gloves.\n\nSurber, who is 36, says he didn\u2019t want to fight, but he agreed because \u201cI did him wrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cI understood his side of it,\u201d Surber says. \u201cIt\u2019s about forgiveness. Sometimes it\u2019s a little bit easier to forgive someone when you get to punch him in the face.\u201d\n\nSpille had requested that they wear mixed martial arts gloves, which can do more damage. Surber insisted they use boxing gloves \u2013 and once they start fighting, he is glad he did.\n\nBy the end of the third round, he has a broken blood vessel in one eye and a couple of bumps forming on his brow. He notices that Spille doesn\u2019t seem to have any marks on him.\n\nSpille, who is 35, threw several missed punches and hurt his shoulder enough that the pain would last for a week. But that day, he later recalls, he \u201cfelt great\u201d.\n\nAfter the fight, he went and bought a six-pack of beer, and invited Surber to join him for one.\n\n\u201cWe actually sat down and talked together for the first time in eight years,\u201d Spille tells me when I call him a few weeks later. I wanted to give him and Surber some time before checking on whether the fight had really settled anything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over and done,\u201d Spille says. \u201cI was in a really bad spot for a long time. It took a long time for me to get over it, and honestly, I never fully got over it until that day.\u201d\n\nHe hadn\u2019t followed Streetbeefs much before his own fight, but he says he now believes in what the group is trying to do. He has a concealed-weapons permit and estimates he owns about 15 guns. He says many of the people he knows hunt and own weapons, too.\n\n\u201cI think what Chris started is an outlet for a lot of people,\u201d he says. \u201cEven people who aren\u2019t beefin\u2019, they might have other demons they are fighting in their heads and they\u2019re letting them loose in the ring.\u201d\n\nSurber says he felt a genuine \u201cconnection\u201d with Spille after their match ended. No winners are declared in beef fights, so that no one will feel as if they lost.\n\n\u201cHe looked me right in my eyes and I looked him in his, and the negativity was out of there,\u201d Surber says. \u201cThat was on his part. He was actually able to forgive me. That\u2019s pretty cool. It felt nice not to have to look over my shoulder.\u201d\n\nBoth men say they don\u2019t expect they\u2019ll ever be good friends again. They also don\u2019t expect to feel any urge to fight if they happen to walk into the same bar, store or gym on the same day.\n\n\u00a9 The Washington Post", "description": "Jeff Spille doesn\u2019t want to talk about what started the beef.\u00a0 \u201cI get it,\u201d I tell him.\u00a0 I know what happened between him and Charles Surber, and it\u2019s personal, it\u2019s painful.\u00a0 It also doesn\u2019t matter what caused the two friends to become enemies.
