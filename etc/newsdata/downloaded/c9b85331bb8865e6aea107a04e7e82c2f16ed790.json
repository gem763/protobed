So gather close, all those who need cheering, and revel in the glorious humanity that is \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d\n\nClaiming the record for most consecutive weeks (19) at No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, \u201cOTR\u201d is the work of Lil Nas X, a 20-year-old from Georgia exploring the formerly terra incognita of country rap. A year ago, this singularly cool cat, with a penchant for rhinestone cowboy suits and diamond earrings\u2014a funky Porter Wagon er, if you can wrap your head around that\u2014was sleeping at his sister\u2019s apartment.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What\u2019s your favorite automotive shoutout in a song? Share below.\n\nThen, using an instrumental track he bought off the internet (sampling a Nine Inch Nails piece), Lil Nas X wrote this all-conquering immortal colossus of a pop song, which has now been streamed nearly two billion times according to Nielsen Music. That. Is. Crazy. In December he put the track on Twitter, where it went globally pandemic. By March, he had signed with Columbia Records. In April, Lil Nas X issued a remix featuring the formerly-washed-up, now-insanely-relevant Billy Ray Cyrus.\n\nIT\u2019S WHAT\u2019S ON THE INSIDE The Quattroporte\u2019s interior is \u2018a jazzy place to do some driving,\u2019 says Dan Neil, with stitched-leather upholstery that\u2019s so soft \u2018it was like the cows wanted to be there.\u2019 Photo: Maserati\n\nThat track ate the world all over again. By Memorial Day, \u201cOTR\u201d was an inescapable megahit and a country bar line-dance phenomenon, this year\u2019s \u201cAchy Breaky Heart.\u201d Talk about bringing people together.\n\nThe lyrics are utterly charming, sly and subversive: My life is a movie/Bull ridin\u2019 and boobies/Cowboy hat from Gucci/Wrangler on my booty\n\n\u201c \u2018Maseratis promise the quintessence of rarity, of European exoticism, of automotive flex. But the cars are, um, not good.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd then this deathless couplet, sung by Billy Ray Cyrus: Baby\u2019s got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras/Riding down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car\n\nThose lines are brilliant: 14 beats each, an improbable near-rhyme with dipodic stresses at the end, a la Renaissance poet John Skelton and every limerick you ever heard. The correct critical response is, \u201cHaww.\u201d\n\nBut why Maserati? What was fired in Lil Nas X\u2019s imagination by those syllables that seem to promise the quintessence of rarity, of European exoticism, of automotive flex? Because the cars are, um, not good.\n\nInspired by \u201cOTR\u201d and encouraged by my 11-year-old daughters, I took delivery of a 2019 Maserati Quattroporte GTS GranSport last week, which turned out to be very much like the one delivered in 2015, except where it was worse. This design generation of the large executive sedan is on a long coast-down; Fiat-Chrysler won\u2019t replace this car until late 2020, as part of a promised new-product offensive of 10 new or revised vehicles by 2023.\n\nDON\u2019T PUSH IT The Quattroporte can reach speeds of 193 mph, but its fashionable rims and faulty Driver\u2019s Assistance Package can make for a jittery ride. Photo: Maserati\n\nMeanwhile, Mazzer\u2019s sales are in free fall. Second-quarter sales were down 17% (7,200 units) and that was the smallest drop in 10 quarters! Maserati lost $132 million in Q2 alone. Obviously, to management, 2023 looks a long way off.\n\nStudents of business history, observe the power, and the limits, of brand: The name Maserati has always had special linguistic electricity. Never mind the oft-bankrupted past. To American ears it\u2019s a bunch of oversexed Latin syllables racing to take their clothes off. Maserati has overscaled in recognition in the U.S. market for decades, a likely No. 1 or No. 2 answer to the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d question, \u201cName an expensive sports car.\u201d That includes decades when they sold no cars here.\n\nI think that answers the question of how Lil Nas X came to invoke Maserati in the first place. It just sounds legendarily chic and cool.\n\n2019 Maserati Quattroporte GTS Gransport Base Price: $138,980 Price, as Tested: $150,410 Powertrain: Twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter DOHC V8; eight-speed automatic transmission with manual-shift mode; rear-wheel drive with limited-slip differential Power/Torque: 523 hp at 7,000 rpm/524 pound-feet at 2,000-4,000 rpm Length/Width/Height/Wheelbase: 207.2/76.7/58.3/124.8 inches Curb Weight: 4,189 pounds 0-60 mph: 4.6 seconds Top Speed: 193 mph EPA Fuel Economy: 15/22/17 mpg\n\nYet, despite the brand\u2019s historic goodwill, all the sexy sheet metal and this year\u2019s tsunami of free publicity and global pop culture awareness thanks to \u201cOTR,\u201d Maserati sales still cratered. You might conclude they are some terrible cars, or those are some messed up retail operations, right? Yes, yes you would.\n\nThe Quattroporte\u2014built near Turin in the same factory that builds the Ghibli, from many of the same parts\u2014is a lovely sedan, for sure. In the age of emojis, I thought the eggplant paint job on our test car was a bit risqu\u00e9. Of course, much of our car\u2019s stanciness and louche curb appeal derived from its bold 21-inch wheels on low-profile tires. But these very cool rims derange the mid-speed ride comfort and refinement, which never dropped below jittery. Yes, it had Mazzer\u2019s stiff-legged adaptive suspension. No, it can\u2019t keep up or damp out the unsprung velocities of these wheels. So the car is a bit of a fashion victim.\n\nThe Quattroporte can still be had, like ours, with a twin-turbocharged, 3.8-liter, 90-degree V8 (523 hp) built by Ferrari, and it\u2019s a proper piece, no question about it, capable of returning an observed nine miles per gallon. The engine does get stingy with the air-conditioning during stop-start cycling; but raw power is there when you need it, if you ever do, transferred to the ground through an eight-speed automatic and limited-slip rear differential. Driven hard and fast, the apparatus performs happily and its synapses are tight. Driven at anything less, and car\u2019s demand-and-drive connections get a lot looser and less coordinated.\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised to find it a jazzy place to do some driving. The stitched-leather upholstery was so soft it was like the cows wanted to be there. The Italians do get leather.\n\nOther things were just underbaked. The car\u2019s (optional) Driver\u2019s Assistance Package lane-keeping system\u2014which is surprisingly hard to turn off\u2014would often rudely shove the car to the center of the lane, to the point where the inputs were unsettling the car. Hmm. I hate that. And if I held the steering wheel with one hand, on either of the lower two quarters, the car would issue a stern rebuke, an alert sound, to put both hands on the wheel. If you ignore the first warning, an even louder sounds. Hmm. I really hate that. This old horse should be headed for the glue factory.", "description": "Despite Maseratis\u2019 sexy exteriors and the boost from getting name-checked in this summer\u2019s hottest song, \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d sales are understandably in free fall, says Dan Neil", "authors": ["Dan Neil", "Dan.Neil Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104223/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
