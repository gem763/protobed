As usual, they find their own lane, load up on juice boxes and fruit roll-ups, open the windows and shout into the wind about how cool and fun this all is. That the road is often uphill doesn\u2019t ever seem to stifle their enthusiasm, even when they have to win \u2014 or lose \u2014 in unique ways that become standard, only to have to find more unique ways again.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt\u2019s probably, frankly, exhausting.\n\nTake Pag\u00e1n, the 28-year-old right-hander who\u2019d had a 4.35 ERA for the Oakland A\u2019s a year ago, was traded to the Rays in the three-way deal that sent Jurickson Profar from the Texas Rangers to the A\u2019s last winter, began this season in Triple-A Durham and by Friday night, over 59 appearances, had become one of the better relievers in the American League.\n\nARLINGTON, TEXAS - SEPTEMBER 10: Emilio Pagan #15 of the Tampa Bay Rays at Globe Life Park in Arlington on September 10, 2019 in Arlington, Texas. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nStory continues\n\nBasically, Pag\u00e1n said, he\u2019d simply decided to become a better pitcher, the sort of decision the Rays would be on board with. So, he\u2019d thought back over the conversations he\u2019d had with former teammates in the Oakland bullpen \u2014 how Lou Trivino chased and maintained velocity, how Shawn Kelley varied his deliveries, how Blake Treinen kept hitters off his fastball with flecks of offspeed pitches \u2014 and when the offseason was over he\u2019d added a mile per hour to his fastball, gotten comfortable with a slide step and retook to a curveball he hadn\u2019t thrown since high school and college. (The Seattle Mariners, his original team, had had him ditch the curveball for a slider, which Pag\u00e1n still sort of throws, except he\u2019s regripped it and turned it into a pitch that more resembles a cutter.)\n\n\u201cI was pretty determined to have a good year,\u201d he said. \u201cI was on such a good team last year and I didn\u2019t contribute to what I thought I was capable of. That ate at me for a long while. I wanted to throw the ball better. I wanted to be a better pitcher.\u201d\n\nThis is how a guy goes from missing the final cut in spring to saving games in September, born from the sorts of choices and commitment every franchise hopes for, and also the sort of happy outcome the Rays rely on.\n\nIt\u2019s why Travis d\u2019Arnaud, dumped by the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers in the same week in May, batted cleanup against the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night, having hit 16 home runs and OPSed .810 in 81 games for the Rays. Why a seemingly chaotic pitching plan \u2014 with openers and bulk men and wholly fluid roles \u2014 is a real plan and is accepted by the real pitchers as a not unreasonable way to do things. And why shortstop Willy Adames becoming a power threat and a defensive asset may escape the notice of most, but not in this clubhouse, not in this dugout, where every inch is counted as the one that just might get them all to October.\n\nSaid d\u2019Arnaud: \u201cI love it here. I love the philosophies here. It\u2019s the new part of baseball that\u2019s trendy and at the same time the old-school stuff. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s how we got here. And I get it.\u201d\n\nAll of that has played for the Rays in 2019, well enough to have 13 games remaining with a decent chance to attend the wild card round, and long enough to have survived to get the ball back to Snell and Glasnow. Last year\u2019s AL Cy Young Award winner, Snell is scheduled to make his first start in two months Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium. Glasnow will start Saturday night in Anaheim, his second start since early May.\n\nST.

They will be one of 14 teams that will not set a single-season franchise record for home runs in 2019. Probably. The other 16 either have or will. They won\u2019t score runs with the New York Yankees or Minnesota Twins or Houston Astros or even the A\u2019s, but they\u2019ll pitch better than all of them, behind Charlie Morton, of whom you have heard, and also Ryan Yarbrough and Diego Castillo and Oliver Drake and Nick Anderson and, among others, yes, Emilio Pag\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cWe love to compete,\u201d Pag\u00e1n said, before getting to the real point, \u201cand we love to prove people wrong.\u201d\n\nThat kind of stimulus only goes so far, for eventually it\u2019s time to pitch and hit. And eventually it\u2019s time for the ninth inning, which has become his time.\n\n\u201cI try and treat it like every other inning,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d like to do or have a chance to do. I think I can do it for as long as I stay healthy. That said, there are 10 guys in our bullpen who have the stuff to be a closer.\u201d\n\nIn the coming two weeks and perhaps beyond, the Rays will count on that. They\u2019ll have to. That, and everything else. Time to shout into the wind. It\u2019s the Rays again.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Striving and innovating, the Tampa Bay Rays are taking another unique path toward the postseason.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oIX0vgAmDcbrXBBsUCd4TQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDYuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mXSlkkV596tTMiV1bFogTg--~B/aD0xODcxO3c9Mjk3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5c7a5950-d6a9-11e9-b35a-d2b0a9d1644b", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
