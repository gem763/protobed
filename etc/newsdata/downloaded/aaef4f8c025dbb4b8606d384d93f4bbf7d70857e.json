In these reports, without any evidence, the parties concerned always pin the label of cyber attack on China and smear China,\" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing.\n\n\"This practice is neither professional nor responsible, and even has ulterior motives,\" Geng said, adding that China \"is a firm defender of network security.\"\n\n- Tempting target -\n\nSeveral sources said they believed a group of hackers linked to the Chinese Communist Party, known as APT10, could be behind the attacks.\n\nThe United States considers APT10 to be state-backed hackers linked to the Chinese intelligence services and military.\n\nBut another source pointed to another group of Chinese hackers known as JSSD, which are believed to operate under the regional security ministry in the coastal province of Jiangsu.\n\nAFP spoke to seven security and industry sources, all of whom confirmed a spate of attacks in the past 12 months but asked for anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the information they were sharing.\n\nTwo security sources involved in investigating the hacking said there had been four major attacks.\n\nAirbus has long been considered a tempting target because of the cutting-edge technologies that have made it one of the world's biggest commercial plane manufacturers, as well as a strategic military supplier.\n\nIn January, it admitted to a security incident that \"resulted in unauthorised access to data\", but people with knowledge of the attacks outlined a concerted and far bigger operation over the last year.\n\nAccording to several of the sources, the hackers appeared to be interested in technical documents linked to the certification process for different parts of Airbus aircraft.\n\nThey also said that several stolen documents were related to the innovative turbo-prop engines used on the Airbus military transport plane A400M.\n\nOne of the sources said the hackers were also interested in the propulsion systems for the Airbus A350 passenger jet, as well as its avionics systems controlling the plane.", "description": "Beijing on Friday rejected an AFP report that Chinese hackers were suspected of being behind a series of cyber attacks on European aerospace giant Airbus.
