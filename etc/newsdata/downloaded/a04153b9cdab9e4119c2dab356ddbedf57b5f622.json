But it\u2019d be well within his power.\n\nConventional wisdom still says there has to be a Trump trial. McConnell, after all, said in March that the Senate would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to hold one if the House voted for impeachment.\n\nBut political conditions can change quickly in the Trump era. And lawmakers from both parties say they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Kentucky Republican ultimately made the same calculation he did in 2016 when President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court \u2014 only for the Democratic president to see his pick axed by McConnell under the auspices of letting voters decide who should fill the vacancy in the next election.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to start hearing that argument and much more loudly, because we\u2019re not too far away from the moment when voters start voting,\u201d said Michael Steel, a longtime GOP operative and aide to former House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make the case why it matters and why it rises to the level of removing an elected president of the United States from the White House.\u201d\n\nParty politics are sure to be front and center in McConnell\u2019s decision. The Senate Republican doesn\u2019t need to worry about his most vulnerable incumbents facing serious primary challengers. The more pressing issue is whether he makes them take a vote exposing them next November to Democratic attacks that they failed to hand Trump the ultimate punishment for his misdeeds.\n\nAmong the many calculations Republicans say McConnell has in his favor is simply the whirlwind that is Trump. Think back to the Sharpie hurricane map, the president\u2019s overtures to buy Greenland or even the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. The GOP can almost take it to the bank that any outrage voters are hearing in the short term about a thwarted impeachment trial would be subsumed by something else come Election Day.\n\n\u201cWe move onto whatever the next thing is,\u201d Steel said.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t get ugly. Impeachment is bare-knuckles stuff, and House Democrats are fuming over a whistleblower complaint that Trump in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s nearly two-year Russia probe asked for another foreign country to help him win an election.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s pretty much widespread agreement on a point that would be central to the debate over a Senate trial \u2014 where a two-thirds vote is required for conviction but where the Constitution itself is sufficiently ambiguous on the requirements for him to do it. In fact, the word \u201cmust\u201d doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in the document.\n\n\u201cUp to the Senate,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in an email. \u201cNo way to force them to act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Senate makes the decision,\u201d agreed Don Ritchie, the retired Senate historian.\n\nFor most senators, the default answer on pretty much every impeachment question in the Trump era has been to punt. It\u2019s too speculative, they frequently say, even when presented with the details of something the president has done that House Democrats are willing to declare has crossed a line worthy of his removal.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s way, way \u2014 that\u2019s way, way \u2014 way down the line,\u201d Delaware Democratic Sen. Tom Carper said this week when asked whether he was concerned about McConnell tabling a Trump impeachment trial.\n\nMcConnell himself didn\u2019t respond when asked by reporters earlier this week whether he\u2019d even allow the Senate to hold a Trump trial, though he did show his cards in a statement to POLITICO that the latest presidential quagmire was \u201claughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, Democratic-led investigations have started moving into a new gear with the first wave of Ukraine-focused subpoenas and depositions. While there\u2019s no firm timetable for committee or floor votes to impeach the president, there are plenty of opinions about how McConnell will handle things should the case end up in his court.\n\n\u201cI trust Mitch McConnell to run the Senate, so I\u2019m sure he would operate in a procedurally appropriate manner,\u201d said Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole. \u201cBut institutionally, if the House votes to impeach, I don\u2019t see how you ignore a trial in the Senate. But, again, I trust his judgment.\u201d\n\nOhio Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge said she\u2019s bracing for McConnell to hit the brakes \u2014 just like he did with the Garland nomination.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the correct thing to do, but I think that\u2019s what he probably would do,\u201d she told POLITICO. \u201cI think there\u2019d be so much pressure, though. I think he\u2019d have to.\u201d\n\nOne thing McConnell won\u2019t be lacking for is precedent \u2014 a mishmash of historical examples on impeachment involving one senator, a Cabinet member, more than a dozen federal judges and a couple of presidents. All reach the same conclusion. It\u2019s up to him.\n\nIn 1797, Sen. William Blount of Tennessee became the first federal official to face impeachment proceedings, though he got expelled from the Senate before his colleagues could hold a trial against him. During President Andrew Johnson\u2019s impeachment, the Senate voted to acquit Abraham Lincoln\u2019s successor on three House-passed articles dealing with his handling of reconstruction after the Civil War. Then the chamber adjourned and never took up the other eight.\n\nMore than a century later, President Richard Nixon appeared headed toward impeachment because of Watergate but his case never even got to the Senate. The Republican instead resigned once senators from his own party came to the White House and told him he\u2019d be toast.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

But Republicans still forced a month-long trial that\u2019s perhaps best remembered for the gold flair stripes that Chief Justice William Rehnquist had specially stitched onto the shoulders of his black robe.\n\n\"We had a hard time figuring out how to proceed,\u201d retired Mississippi GOP Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader during the Clinton trial, said in an interview. He recalled how his own lawyers had advised him that \u201cif the House acted to impeach, we had to take it up in some way or another and consider it in the Senate.\u201d\n\nLott\u2019s Democratic counterpart, retired South Dakota Sen. Tom Daschle, said in an email that he too leaned on his party\u2019s top lawyer, Bob Bauer, for help interpreting the requirements to hold an impeachment trial. Bauer, who would go on to become White House counsel under Obama, earlier this year penned an analysis on the blog Lawfare on exactly this topic.\n\nHe wrote that \u201cin this time of disregard and erosion of established institutional practices and norms\u201d McConnell could very well buck Senate tradition and move to skip a Trump trial. \u201cAnd he would not have to look far to find the constitutional arguments and the flexibility to revise Senate rules and procedures to accomplish this purpose,\u201d Bauer added.\n\nShould McConnell allow a trial, the Senate would have a chance to vote on rules covering the whole process. In Clinton\u2019s case in 1999, during a meeting in their historic early 19th century chamber in the Capitol, the Senate hammered out a plan for how many hours the House GOP impeachment managers and the president\u2019s lawyers would have to argue their case and pose questions.\n\nThere\u2019s also another set of applicable Senate impeachment trial rules that would probably come into play \u2014 and they are a throwback to another era. For example, there\u2019s a specific script that the House sergeant at arms must read aloud when presenting the articles of impeachment on the Senate floor, including a command that all senators must be silent during the reading \u201con pain of imprisonment.\u201d\n\nSpecific start times must be followed for the different parts of the trial: 1 p.m. for the first Senate session on the day after it receives the articles of impeachment from the House; 12:30 p.m. to swear in the senators as jurors: noon for each day of the trial itself. There are exceptions to change the times with a vote.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this: An official facing impeachment is allowed to appear before the Senate or send lawyers to answer to the charges. Clinton used a combination of attorneys from the White House counsel\u2019s office, his private team and former Sen. Dale Bumpers to make his case. With Trump, the line begs the question whether the former reality television star might use his pugnacious personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani or just make the trip down Pennsylvania Avenue and defend himself.\n\nThat is, if there even is a trial.\n\nWhile the decision clearly rests with McConnell and his GOP counterparts, Texas Democratic Rep. Al Green argued in an interview that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who under the Constitution presides over an impeachment trial in the Senate, could also play a key role in resolving any dispute.\n\n\u201cDoes he want to preside over a kangaroo court, or does he want the reputation of the Senate, the Supreme Court and his own legacy to be upheld?\u201d said Green, who has already forced three House floor votes on Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cI would hope that Chief Justice Roberts would have the concern of more than Mr. McConnell and the Republican Party within his thought processes. This is a time for us all to rise to the occasion and come to the aid of our country.\u201d\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/54/9e/0400a1b7417db51636c6306f715f/190927-trump-mcconnell-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
