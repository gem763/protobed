And the opposition Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called on members of Parliament to reject it.\n\nMr. Johnson announced the agreement on Twitter, saying that the parties had reached a \u201cgreat new deal that takes back control\u201d and that Parliament would now be clear to vote on the agreement on Saturday.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment #GetBrexitDone #TakeBackControl \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 17, 2019\n\nJean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission\u2019s president, confirmed that a deal had been struck and noted that a revised arrangement on Northern Ireland had been reached.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter: \u201cWhere there is a will, there is a #deal \u2014 we have one! It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s frantic efforts to negotiate a Brexit agreement with the European Union had appeared to hit a last-minute snag, after the D.U.P. said in a statement on Thursday morning that it could not support the deal \u201cas things stand.\u201d\n\nThe statement, hours before Mr. Johnson was to present the deal to European leaders at a summit meeting in Brussels, suggested that domestic politics once again threatened to torpedo the complex negotiations.\n\nIt was unclear whether the deal had been altered before the agreement with European leaders was reached. It was also unclear whether the Northern Irish party simply wanted to make a show of holding out for its position before ultimately acquiescing \u2014 or whether Mr. Johnson faced a serious rebellion from the skeptics in his ranks.\n\nMr. Johnson may have an advantage over his predecessor Theresa May, in passing the deal through parliament because he has assiduously cultivated the most skeptical elements of his party.\n\nFor days, Mr. Johnson has worked frantically to bridge a gap over the thorny question of how to treat Northern Ireland in a post-Brexit Europe \u2014 a fiendishly complex issue that helped torpedo Mrs. May\u2019s agreement and could still fracture Mr. Johnson\u2019s Conservative-led coalition in Parliament.\n\nWhile the details of the deal were not yet clear, people briefed on the talks said Mr. Johnson had given significant ground on the structure of a customs unions that would allow Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, to continue to trade seamlessly with Ireland and other members of the European Union.\n\nIt was a dramatic culmination to down-to-the-wire talks that began on Tuesday morning, with some European officials predicting that the two sides would not be able to close the gap on customs issues in time to finalize a draft deal before the critical summit meeting of European leaders began on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe value of the British pound soared on the news of a deal to a five-month high, trading at $1.29 to the dollar.\n\nIt reversed a slump earlier in the day, when the Democratic Unionists signaled it would not back Mr. Johnson\u2019s draft deal.\n\n\u201cAs things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on a customs and consent issues, and there is a lack of clarity on VAT,\u201d the party said in a statement issued earlier on Thursday, referring to the value-added tax.\n\nThe party said it would continue working with the government on an acceptable agreement.\n\nMr. Johnson has consulted closely the Democratic Unionists and other skeptical elements of his Conservative Party-led coalition as a deal has taken shape. On Wednesday, optimism had grown amid signs in Brussels that the deadlock over Britain\u2019s planned departure from the bloc could be on the verge of breaking.\n\nThe statement from the Democratic Unionists suggested that Mr. Johnson faces a tense day of negotiations, even though a draft deal had largely been hammered out.\n\nBrussels has pushed Mr. Johnson so far that it \u201cmakes sense they are unhappy,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst with the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said of the Democratic Unionists. But he said it was unclear how serious the setback was, because \u201cthe D.U.P. does have to be seen fighting.\u201d\n\nRoom to maneuver is limited, however. The two sides could agree on some \u201coptical tweaks\u201d to mollify the skeptics, said a European official not authorized to speak publicly, adding that European Union leaders would be \u201ccautious to give more.\u201d\n\nThe intervention from the Democratic Unionists underscored the problems that Mr. Johnson will inevitably confront in trying to get any deal through Parliament, where he does not have a majority. Without the support of the D.U.P., Mr. Johnson has little hope of getting any agreement ratified by Parliament.\n\nIt is also a reminder that he faces many of the problems confronted by his luckless predecessor, Theresa May, who suffered a similar setback. In December 2017, the Democratic Unionists derailed her efforts to reach a deal to allow her to proceed to another phase in the Brexit negotiations.\n\nThat happened while Mrs. May was holding a working lunch with the European Commission\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker. She was forced to pause discussions, and keep diplomats waiting, to take a call from Arlene Foster, the Democratic Unionist Party\u2019s leader.\n\nMrs. May then returned with a revised plan several days later, at which point Ms. Foster said that the new version ensured that there would be no border between Britain and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.\n\nEssentially, Mr. Johnson\u2019s proposed agreement would leave Northern Ireland aligned with European Union laws and regulations on most trade issues, even as it moved out of the European single market and into a customs union with Britain.\n\nUnder the proposed terms, there would be customs checks on goods flowing from Britain to Northern Ireland to ensure that they meet the rules if those goods were ultimately destined for the European Union.\n\nThere would be a complex series of rules on tariffs and value-added tax payments to compensate for differences in tariff rates between the European and British customs unions, though negotiators struggled late on Tuesday to resolve the issue of how to rebate value-added tax payments.\n\nThe arrangement would also be subject to consent by the Northern Ireland Assembly, but in a way that would prevent the Democratic Unionists, who have opposed previous such proposals, from simply vetoing it at the first possible opportunity\n\nThe Democratic Unionists are crucial to Mr. Johnson\u2019s effort to win a majority for the deal in Parliament. Their opposition to similar previous versions of a Brexit agreement forced Mrs. May to overhaul that agreement to place all of Britain in the European customs union for a period of time.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s deal was, nevertheless, soundly defeated in Parliament three times.\n\nMr. Johnson was seen as having a better chance of cobbling together a majority, in part because he was a vocal supporter of Brexit before the 2016 referendum and thus has greater credibility with euroskeptic elements of the Conservative coalition.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party campaigned for Brexit in the 2016 referendum campaign, and Mr. Johnson has presented his plan as the last chance to deliver on that mandate from voters. In Northern Ireland as a whole, however, 56 percent of voters in the referendum favored remaining in the European Union.\n\nYet, for the party, which is strongly committed to maintaining Northern Ireland\u2019s status as a part of the United Kingdom, the issues being negotiated by Mr. Johnson are existential. That is because if they bind Northern Ireland much more closely to Ireland, its southern neighbor, some fear that it would inevitably lead to a united Ireland.\n\nIf the Democratic Unionists have collectively decided that the proposals are unacceptable, they will have to change to secure support.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Johnson spoke by telephone with Mr. Juncker, Downing Street said, without giving further detail. Mr. Johnson\u2019s hope is to win approval of the deal in Brussels by Friday and then put it to a vote in a special session of the House of Commons on Saturday.\n\nThe Democratic Unionists, who have proved to be a pivotal blocking force in previous attempts to negotiate an agreement to extricate Britain from the bloc, said they were troubled by elements of the deal on how to handle Northern Ireland in a post-Brexit world.\n\nThe prime minister has vowed to withdraw Britain from the European Union, with or without a deal, by Oct. 31, and his negotiators have labored to seal an agreement by this week so that he is not forced to ask Brussels for an extension, as would be required under a measure that Parliament passed last month.\n\nEuropean negotiators have used that tight timetable as leverage to push Mr. Johnson on the issue of Northern Ireland. The deal taking shape is not all that different from the one that the European Union proposed to Mrs. May \u2014 and which she concluded she could not accept because of opposition from the Democratic Unionists.\n\nAnna Schaverien contributed reporting from London.\n\nMark Landler is the London bureau chief of The New York Times.
