While plenty of fast-food stocks have jumped in 2019, McDonald\u2019s (ticker: MCD) stock has gained about 15%, trailing the S&P 500\u2019s nearly 20% gain year to date. Still, the company is a favorite among analysts, who like its strong underlying fundamentals, use of technology, embrace of delivery, and tests of meat-alternative products with Beyond Meat (BYND) burger patties. The shares got a boost from its previous second-quarter-earnings report over the summer.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. Early Tuesday, McDonald\u2019s said it earned $2.11 a share, a dime below the $2.21 consensus estimate, on revenue of $5.43 billion, which was also slightly below the $5.47 billion analysts were expecting.\n\nThe company said that global same-store sales were up 5.9%, slightly ahead of expectations, including a 4.8% increase in the U.S., although analysts were looking for growth of more than 5% for domestic locations. McDonald\u2019s also announced an 8% increase to its dividend, to $1.25 a share.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nLooking ahead. It\u2019s no doubt that the profit and sales miss was a disappointment for McDonald\u2019s, and while the stock hasn\u2019t kept pace with those of peers that have rallied ahead of the market, investors were still clearly hoping for a better showing. While international comparable sales have been a big driver for the stock lately, softness in the U.S. market wasn\u2019t welcome news\u2014and could spark worries that the sector is becoming more competitive (which can dampen results across the board).\n\nStill, it wasn\u2019t all bad news in the quarter. Although fixed costs did rise, in part on a higher-than-anticipated tax rate, part of that was also due to the company\u2019s ongoing investments in technology, which should help McDonald\u2019s in the future. International markets are still showing strength, and for company-owned stores in the U.S., margins expanded in the quarter.\n\nHowever, the headline miss is grabbing most of the attention this morning and McDonald\u2019s stock is down 3.8% to $201.90 in recent trading.\n\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com", "description": "Early Tuesday, the burger giant said it earned $2.11 a share, a dime below the $2.21 consensus estimate, on revenue of $5.43 billion, which was also slightly below the $5.47 billion analysts were expecting.", "authors": ["Teresa Rivas"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111220/social", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
