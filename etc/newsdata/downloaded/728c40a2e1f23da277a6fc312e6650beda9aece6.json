REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nWith flyhalf Dan Biggar and winger George North also emerging from injury clouds, coach Warren Gatland was able to name his strongest side, the same starting line-up which took the field in the 29-25 win over Australia in the pool phase.\n\nCentre Davies had been the biggest doubt after sustaining the knee injury in the subsequent match against Fiji, while Biggar took head knocks against the Wallabies and again when facing the Fijians.There was also a question mark over Davies\u2019s centre partner Hadleigh Parkes, who has been playing with a fractured finger and hurt his shoulder against Uruguay, but Gatland said he had enjoyed the luxury of 31 fit players to choose from.\n\n\u201cAs a squad, we\u2019re pretty happy really,\u201d the New Zealander said.\n\n\u201cThere are still a couple of sore bodies but in a good state. Jonathan took a full part in Wednesday\u2019s session, he fully trained today. We kept Hadleigh out of the rugby on Wednesday but they\u2019re both fit.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be ready to go on Sunday.\u201d\n\nNorth also sat out Wales\u2019s final pool match against Uruguay because of a sore ankle but returned to full training this week and will face the French at Oita Stadium on Sunday.\n\nIn the back row, Gatland has reverted to the combination of youngster Aaron Wainwright at blindside, the experienced Justin Tipuric at openside and Josh Navidi in the number eight shirt with Ross Moriarty on the bench.\n\nThe one change from the Wallabies game came on the bench, where Rhys Carre replaced Nicky Smith as reserve loosehead prop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another game of rugby but we know how important it is,\u201d Gatland added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very focused on wanting to go out there and stay in this tournament. There is a lot of confidence in this squad. We haven\u2019t given an 80 minute performance here.\n\n\u201cAnything could happen in international rugby (but) if you\u2019re good enough, then you win the games.\u201d\n\nTeam: 15-Liam Williams, 14-George North, 13-Jonathan Davies, 12-Hadleigh Parkes, 11-Josh Adams, 10-Dan Biggar, 9-Gareth Davies, 8-Josh Navidi, 7-Justin Tipuric, 6- Aaron Wainwright, 5-Alun Wyn Jones, 4-Jake Ball, 3-Tomas Francis, 2-Ken Owens, 1-Wyn Jones\n\nReplacements: 16-Elliot Dee, 17-Rhys Carre, 18-Dillon Lewis, 19-Aaron Shingler, 20-Ross Moriarty, 21-Tomos Williams, 22-Rhys Patchell, 23-Owen Watkin", "description": "Wales received a huge boost on Friday when centre Jonathan Davies was passed fit to take his place in the side for the Rugby World Cup quarter-final against France after recovering from a knee injury.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442206274&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0KQ-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
