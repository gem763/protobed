Various bird sanctuaries like the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, Okhla bird sanctuary and Sultanpur National Park become a host to these migrating guests who stay here until native habitat conditions are stabilised.\n\nBCCL\n\nOver the years, there is a visible distinction in number of migratory birds flocking to Delhi. On an average, 255-255 species of migratory birds make way to Delhi but there is a visible dip.\n\nDon't Miss 552 SHARES 149 SHARES 101 SHARES 148 SHARES\n\nBirds from northern hemisphere migrate to India from Mongolia, Siberia, China Tibet and Europe from October and return by March when the weather becomes normal.\n\nLike past years, stubble burning has deteriorated air quality in Delhi which is also affecting the arrival of birds. Migratory birds cross countries and cover large distances to find comfort, but the plummeting air quality is affecting their count.\n\nBlack redstart and red-breasted flycatcher were once easily spotted in Delhi\u2019s sanctuaries and satellite cities. Northern Shoveller, Northern Pintail, Gadwall, Common Pochard, Wigeon are regular migratory birds invading Sultanpur Park, Danauri wetlands, Surajpur and Okhla.\n\nBCCL\n\nToday you can see cormorants and a few varieties of wagtails only.\n\nBirds are now delaying their visit largely owing to increased air pollution of which Delhi is among the biggest victims, and water pollution.\n\nTill about a few years ago, birdwatchers could easily spot over 100 flamingos in the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, a four sq km expanse on the banks of the Yamuna. Now, the number is reduced to somewhere between 10-20.", "description": "Usually, Migratory birds visit natural bird sanctuaries and habitat parks from the mid of October and normally migrate until March.
