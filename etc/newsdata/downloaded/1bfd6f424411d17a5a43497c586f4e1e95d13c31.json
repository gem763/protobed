John Sununu said on Monday that the Ukraine phone call scandal involving President Trump is just a repeat of how the Democrats' Russian collusion narrative unfolded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a repeat, it\u2019s a rerun, it\u2019s a sequel to what they did with Russia,\u201d Sununu told \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom.\u201d\n\nTrump was accused of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy into investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, for their ties to a natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, which was being investigated as part of a corruption case. This prompted Democratic lawmakers to call for the release of the entire transcript of the phone call in question.\n\nUKRAINE PHONE CALL SCANDAL IS MEDIA STRIKING BACK AFTER FAILED RUSSIA HOAX, SAYS DAN BONGINO\n\n\u201c[Democratic California House Rep. Adam] Schiff goes out, makes an outrageous statement, as he did with the Russia claims, and the Mueller report just made it clear that all those claims that came out of Schiff were pure unadulterated lies,\u201d said Sununu, who served as White House chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush.\n\nSARAH SANDERS: MEDIA 'HAS EGG ON THEIR FACE' FROM FAILING TO MAKE RUSSIA COLLUSION NARRATIVE STICK\n\nSununu said that the Trump administration should release the entire transcript as he is aware that it would draw concern.\n\n\u201cIf I were the White House, I would try and release as much as the transcript of the conversation as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that if the transcript were to be disclosed, foreign leaders will not speak frankly with the president in fear that the intelligence community in the U.S. can't keep secrets.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSununu went on to say, \u201cThis has got a long way to go. A lot of information will come out. The Dems will do what they did. The press will do what they did. You\u2019re probably going to get Carl Bernstein, claiming it\u2019s another Watergate and so on.\"\n\nSpeaking on CNN, Bernstein did, in fact, compare the Ukraine scandal to Watergate.\n\nFox News\u2019 Nick Givas contributed to this report.", "description": "Former New Hampshire Gov.
