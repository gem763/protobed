They Searched 57 Days for Their Dog.", "language": "en", "text": "Carole and Verne King with their border collie, Katie, at their home in Deer Park, Wash., Sept. 20, 2019. (Rajah Bose/The New York Times)\n\nAfter a late night at a stock-car race, Carole and Verne King returned to their dog-friendly hotel in Kalispell, Montana, and made a devastating discovery.\n\nTheir 7-year-old border collie, Katie, was no longer in the room. She had apparently managed to unlatch the door, possibly spooked by a thunderstorm that had swept through the area. At the front desk, an attendant said she had seen an anxious dog bolt out the front door hours before.\n\nThe Kings were stunned. In the town of 23,000 people that backs up to the sprawling wilderness near Glacier National Park, surrounded by forests and fields, where would they even start looking?\n\nOver the next 57 days, the couple set out on a desperate search that included night-vision goggles, animal-tracking cameras and horse manure brought in from the family\u2019s farm in Eastern Washington. Carole King, a postal carrier, quit her job.\n\n\u201cEvery night going to bed, it was gut-wrenching,\u201d said Verne King. \u201cIs she warm? Did she get to eat today? It tore us up.\u201d\n\nDay 1\n\n\u2018Like a Crime Scene\u2019\n\nAfter the initial discovery, the Kings spent the night frantically searching nearby neighborhoods, where alfalfa farms and homes and new shopping centers collide in northern Kalispell.\n\nThey were out until about 4 a.m., the Kings said, but saw no sign of the dog. The front-desk attendant asked them to send some photos, and together they began making and distributing flyers around the area.\n\nHundreds of them were posted on light poles and community mailboxes, and handed out through door-to-door canvassing and at local sports events. They posted Katie\u2019s photo on Facebook pages and lost-pet internet networks. Strangers joined them in walking the neighborhoods in search of Katie.\n\nAs former law-enforcement officers from Los Angeles, the Kings knew to look through abandoned buildings. They examined the dirt in alfalfa fields, looking for tracks or dog droppings. They considered the possibility that Katie had been struck by a car on the highway, but without any evidence, they pressed on.\n\n\u201cYou think of it like a crime scene,\u201d Verne King said.\n\nDay 15\n\nTraps and Scents\n\nAfter a couple weeks of searching, the Kings decided to try some more extreme measures. They ordered two game cameras, the kind used by wildlife researchers, that could record video when an animal passed. They ordered animal traps, hoping that food \u2014 like the cheese sticks Katie preferred \u2014 would coax her into a cage.\n\nCarole King also began going jogging and biking around the neighborhoods, hoping that her sweat could signal the dog that her family was near. They left used T-shirts at strategic locations, as well as Katie\u2019s blanket and dog bowl.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any street we haven\u2019t been on in that area,\u201d Carole King said.\n\nThe couple later brought in hair shavings and a couple of buckets of manure from their horses back home and, with approval from local farmers, spread it near traps and other possible locations.\n\nLater, after hearing speculation that Katie might be on the move at night time, the couple acquired night-vision goggles and spent hours out in the cold, hoping to catch a glimpse of Katie traversing a field.\n\nBut they saw no activity. The camera footage showed no sign of their dog. The traps? They caught a magpie, a cat and four skunks.\n\nDay 22\n\nPossible Sightings\n\nTips, however, were coming in. As people reported possible sightings, the Kings scrambled to follow up.\n\nOn one occasion, they drove 15 miles to Columbia Falls on a tip, even though it seemed far-fetched. Other times they would go to check even when the description of the dog didn\u2019t sound quite right.\n\n\u201cIn our heart, I would always say, \u2018If I didn\u2019t follow up, what if that was her and we didn\u2019t do anything?\u201d Carole King said.\n\nSometimes it would turn out to be a different dog. On one occasion, while they were talking to a landowner at a farm, a woman came up to them and said she had just seen their dog cross the road and run into a canola field. The Kings set off running, calling for Katie.\n\nThey didn\u2019t find her.\n\nDay 37\n\nQuitting Her Job\n\nCarole King was still working as a postal carrier back in the Spokane area. For a week in August, she had to return home while her husband continued the search.\n\nShe talked with her bosses about taking some time off. But that wasn\u2019t feasible during summer months. Although the money had helped supplement their pensions, she gave her notice.", "description": "After a late night at a stock-car race, Carole and Verne King returned to their dog-friendly hotel in Kalispell, Montana, and made a devastating discovery.Their 7-year-old border collie, Katie, was no longer in the room.
