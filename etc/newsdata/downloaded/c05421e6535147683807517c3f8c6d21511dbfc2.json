The company made a name for itself with a slew of well designed and thoughtfully appointed smartphones, and I was hoping to see that sort of thinking applied to a TV \u2014 so I was only too happy to test the 55 Q1 Pro over the past few days.\n\nBesides featuring a QLED screen, a minimalist remote control, and a mechanized soundbar that slides into place beneath the screen when it\u2019s turned out, the 55-inch Q1 Pro comes with Android TV on board (based on Android Pie 9.0), as well as OnePlus\u2019 own content discovery service.\n\nIt\u2019s also surprisingly expensive for the Indian market, which has recently seen a flood of competitively priced smart TVs from several Asian brands. And OnePlus hasn\u2019t yet said if it\u2019ll make its TVs available elsewhere. So, here\u2019s my take on the company\u2019s foray into home entertainment, in the form of the $1,408 (Rs. 99,900) 55 Q1 Pro.\n\nI should note that we\u2019ve used OnePlus\u2018 photos for this review instead of my own, as it was near impossible on my limited schedule to shoot pictures in my living room without my own existing TV messing things up.\n\nSee what I mean?\n\nDesign and features\n\nThe Q1 Pro seems designed to blend into any home, with a narrow bezel around the display, and an oval polished metallic stand. It looks elegant, and this shape allows for placing the TV on a console or table that\u2019s smaller than the width of the screen. However, it doesn\u2019t help you hide your cables as they snake from multitude of ports on the TV\u2019s rear \u2013 unlike some other well designed stands from LG\u2019s stable.\n\nThe OnePlus TV\u2019s base saves on space at the bottom \u2013 but there\u2019s not much by way of cable management\n\nThere are a couple of neat design flourishes, like the carbon fiber-patterned rear, the ports section on the rear that\u2019s concealed with a pattern-matched removable panel, and the mechanized soundbar. The latter is hidden from view when the TV\u2019s turned off, and slides down when you turn it on. It lights up too, and pulses to the beat of music that you play on the speakers over Bluetooth.\n\nThe OnePlus TV remote supports voice commands via Google Assistant\n\nThe Bluetooth remote is well designed, with a compact form factor, and just a handful of buttons to navigate the Android TV interface. You can also speak into it to issue commands via Google Assistant, and charge it through its USB-C port.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe Q1 TVs feature mostly stock Android TV, with a couple of little customizations. The big one is called OxygenPlay, and it\u2019s essentially a one-stop destination for browsing content available across all your subscribed streaming services. At present, a bunch of local offerings like Amazon Prime Video, Eros Now, Hungama, Jio Cinema, and Zee 5 are supported \u2013 and when you tap on a movie or show in there, it\u2019ll fire that right up. If you\u2019ve tried a Xiaomi Mi TV in India, you\u2019ll find this similar to the company\u2019s PatchWall software.\n\nThis works well enough, but my main issue with the interface is text input: as with many other smart TVs, you\u2019ve got to fiddle with a D-pad to find letters on an on-screen keyboard. Now, you can use voice commands with Google Assistant, and there\u2019s a sort of \u2018universal search\u2019 tool in one section of the interface \u2013 but neither of these work well, and I usually got far worse results than if I\u2019d used the more painful on-screen keyboard.\n\nOnePlus\u2019 OxygenPlay app helps you find content to watch from across various streaming services\n\nOnePlus has customized the screensaver so it brings up pictures shot by other users of its phones, when the TV is idle. You can also connect your phone or tablet to the TV to use as a Bluetooth speaker; when connected , the lights on the soundbar glow in time to the beat. I still don\u2019t know how I feel about that, but at least it\u2019s not some gross visual assault of cycling RGB colors.\n\nThe Q1 Pro has Chromecast functionality built in, so you can beam content from your phone to your TV just as you would with Google\u2019s hardware dongle plugged in. This works as expected, but I\u2019ve noticed that performance sometimes suffers when compared to running the same content using locally installed apps \u2013 such as 4K YouTube videos.\n\nThere\u2019s another feature I like a lot more than I\u2019d care for: the TV turns down the volume automatically when you receive a call on your phone (which has the Connect remote app installed).\n\nOnePlus\u2019 Connect app lets you use your phone as a remote for the TV\n\nI wish the company added more quality-of-life tweaks like this to the package, so as to make this TV feel less like just another one you can grab at the store and more like a well thought-out OnePlus product. The company hasn\u2019t included farfield mics \u2013 which would pick up voice commands with a wake word from anywhere in the room \u2013 though there\u2019s a slot for them at the top of the TV, and the Q1 Pro doesn\u2019t support Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2.\n\nLiving with the Q1 Pro\n\nThis TV is certainly capable of delivering a good viewing experience, thanks to its QLED panel and support for standards like HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. However, since it\u2019s a VA panel, its viewing angles aren\u2019t great. That means that if you\u2019re sitting about three full-size couch seats away from the center of the TV, on-screen colors will seem a bit off, and that\u2019s particularly noticeable in skin tones. However, it\u2019s not so bad as to be deemed unwatchable.\n\nThe on-board processor and graphics chip are generally good at keeping navigation fluid and mostly painless \u2013 but at times, firing up apps took a little longer than I\u2019d like, and launching content can cause video to skip a frame or two for a bit. The same thing happens with some 4K video, like high-res clips on YouTube, and I noticed lags across the entire lengths of videos \u2014 as opposed to only during the first few seconds like with a Chromecast dongle. I\u2019d have liked to have seen OnePlus tackle this sort of thing, given its \u2018Never Settle\u2019 ethos.\n\nNext, OnePlus chose to apply some poorly chosen picture settings to the default mode, so you\u2019ll be subject to oversaturated colors and unnaturally smooth motion. One aggressive HDR setting made some Amazon Prime Video shows practically unwatchable, but this has been resolved in a recent software update.\n\nNot having Netflix at launch has proved to a real bummer, particularly because we don\u2019t know exactly when support for the service will become available.\n\nAs for picture quality, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. I switched from OnePlus\u2019 silly overblown settings to \u2018Film\u2019 before I got going, and things went well after that. Colors are rich and vibrant, contrast is solid, and the panel is capable of getting plenty bright. However, you\u2019ll want to tweak the settings to suit your room and lighting before settling in for your first binge. The edges are a tad darker than the rest of the screen, but this didn\u2019t prove to be a major issue while watching films and shows.\n\nThe OnePlus TV 55 Q1 Pro gets a sliding eight-speaker soundbar, while the standard model gets four speakers\n\nUnlike most TVs, the Q1 Pro is actually a winner in the audio department, thanks to the well designed sliding soundbar. There are four full range speakers, two tweeters for highs, and two 10W woofers for bass output. I generally pooh-pooh in-built sound systems on TVs, but this one is seriously capable, to the point that I usually don\u2019t feel the need to fire up my external soundbar and other speaker sets that are hooked up in my living room, whether I\u2019m listening to music or watching an action movie packed with explosions and dramatic dialogue.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a small living room like mine that accommodates about five or six people, it\u2019s adequate. But if you\u2019re setting this up in a larger space, you might want to consider additional firepower. Still, props to OnePlus for delivering pretty darn solid speakers into a TV \u2014 something most other manufacturers haven\u2019t managed in years.\n\nPlaying games on the Q1 Pro, with my laptop hooked up via HDMI, was an absolute treat. When photorealistic lighting isn\u2019t absolutely necessary, the TV is great for blasting through titles like Control, GRIP, and No Man\u2019s Sky. However, you\u2019re limited to 60 fps. That\u2019s enough for smooth gameplay, but it\u2019s not on par with the smoothness of dedicated gaming monitors that support higher frame rates, or some new high-end TVs from LG.\n\nWho\u2019s this for?\n\nNow for some harsher words: while OnePlus has proved it can build a pretty good TV, it hasn\u2019t brought its A-game on the software front. It\u2019s not terrible, but it lacks that OnePlus touch, in the form of a suite of thoughtful features.\n\nThe Q1 Pro\u2019s Achilles\u2019 Heel is pricing. At Rs. 99,900 ($1,408), it\u2019s closer to premium 4K smart TVs from heavy hitters known for outstanding picture quality and finish like LG, Sony, and Samsung. However, its panel isn\u2019t on par with sets at this range; it\u2019s more easily comparable to TVs from TCL and Xiaomi, which are more focused on features than pure image fidelity. Those competing products are far cheaper, and it seems like OnePlus has slapped on too hefty a price tag on its good-but-not-incredible TV.\n\nAnd while the soundbar on the Pro is nice, it costs Rs. 30,000 ($420) more than than the model with four fewer speakers. For half that price difference, you can pick up an external soundbar that will blow the Pro\u2019s speakers out of the water.\n\nSo, at Rs. 99,900, the OnePlus TV is hard to recommend. But if you\u2019re good with the feature set, and like the idea of a capable built-in soundbar, this is a an enjoyable piece of kit.\n\nFind the Q1 Pro on Amazon India; there\u2019s also the regular Q1, which comes without the soundbar and the stand, at Rs. 69,900 ($982).\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "OnePlus' first TV has a lot going for it, including a couple of neat features - but that's not enough to rattle the competition.
