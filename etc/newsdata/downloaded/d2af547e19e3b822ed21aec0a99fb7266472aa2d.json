Some are lamenting that Ukraine\u2019s long-running association with corruption is now front and center on the international stage.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine, very few people are versed in the matter deeply,\u201d said Alexey Pristup, a 23-year-old television host in the Ukrainian city of Odesa. \u201cI\u2019m angry Ukraine was dragged into this. It spoils (our) image.\u201d\n\nANDREW MCCARTHY: THE TRIVIALIZATION OF IMPEACHMENT IS SERIOUS -- IT HAS CONSEQUENCES THAT THREATEN LIBERTY\n\nThe scandal unraveled last month after it was revealed a whistleblower filed a complaint against President Trump in the wake of a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. That triggered the question of whether the U.S. president delayed sending military aid to Kyiv as part of a more significant push to advance personal interests and pressure the government to investigate the dealings of potential 2020 political rival Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter who served on the board of a major energy company.\n\nIn the days after Kiev\u2019s role in the burgeoning Washington scandal was unveiled, the issue hit the headlines across Ukraine. While it has maintained a steady stream of related news and op-eds, most on the ground contend that their focus \u2013 and that of their press \u2013 is centered on more pressing domestic issues.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is an American-only concern and not really a massive issue in Ukraine, and will probably stay that way so long as it doesn\u2019t impact current U.S. policy toward Kyiv,\u201d Christopher Hartwell, a professor at Bournemouth University in England and the former president of the Eastern European-focused Center for Social and Economic Research, told Fox News.\n\nIndeed, observers say that the political drama engrossing Washington circles is primarily only discussed by academic, business, and political elites and is far from the mind of average Ukrainians.\n\n\u201cOther issues related to corruption, land reform, economic relations, and updates from the war are dominating Ukraine news cycles...and I am sure (President) Zelensky and Ukrainians know that Democrats are just using them as pawns in U.S. political posturing,\u201d Hartwell said.\n\nThe attention has, however, prompted some in the country to reflect on the past administration\u2019s handling of the Ukraine situation and cast scrutiny on the Biden name -- a name not necessarily widely known in the nation of 45 million and deemed the poorest in the region.\n\nWhile his father served as vice president of the United States and was tasked with overseeing Ukrainian matters, Hunter Biden was controversially elected to the board of Ukrainian private gas company Burisma, despite a lack of experience in the energy arena and questions over conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cVice President Joe Biden, who was President Obama\u2019s point person regarding Ukraine since at least 2009, was perceived as a fighter against corruption,\u201d said Kenneth McCallion, a former federal prosecutor and expert on organized crime, who represented former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and U.S. business interests in Ukraine. \u201cBut Ukrainians think it was inappropriate for Hunter to be on the board of Burisma.\u201d\n\nViktor Panchak, a risk assessment in security specialist in Kyiv, echoed the sentiment that only a small fraction of the more privileged sector of the population is engaged in following the impeachment proceedings, but that those within the energy sector have long abdicated decisive views pertaining to Hunter Biden\u2019s foray into the industry by joining the board in April 2014.\n\n\u201cThere was a change when he joined the board, Burisma was treated as special,\u201d Panchak acknowledged. \u201cIt was given top coverage by politicians. There is no fog without fire in this country.\u201d\n\nAnd the name Biden is one that elicits a mixed response.\n\n\u201c(Joe) Biden is a clever man with somewhat fraudulent leanings, but everyone is acting in the own interests of one\u2019s families,\u201d conjectured Valentina Iliana, a 49-year-old from Odessa.\n\nNonetheless, Trump seemingly maintains a steady and robust support base in Ukraine; many Ukrainians asserted, primarily borne out of distrust for the previous administrations.\n\n\u201cMany Ukrainians were disappointed that the Obama administration didn\u2019t do more to help their country after Russia invaded in 2014. Kyiv repeatedly asked the Obama White House to deliver lethal weapons \u2013 the Javelin anti-tank missile, specifically. But the move was not approved until Trump took office,\u201d said Nolan Peterson, a Ukraine-based correspondent for The Daily Signal, a news platform run by The Heritage Foundation. \u201cThe impeachment story is far from the biggest story in Ukraine. Joe Biden is not a household name in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBeing connected to something akin to a Washington furor has some Ukrainians frustrated and on-edge. Issues of malfeasance and judicial independence from political powers remain sensitive matters.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe situation with Trump and possible impeachment doesn\u2019t really worry Ukrainians now,\u201d observed Serhii Shpota, a 29-year-old web developer who hails from the Russia-occupied region of Lugansk. \u201cI had never heard of Biden before this scandal, but I definitely don\u2019t want Ukraine to be a bargaining chip in American politics.\u201d\n\nAccording to Todd Rosenblum, a former senior Obama administration official, and Senate intelligence committee staffer, being catapulted into the limelight is making many in Ukraine \u201cvery nervous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are used to a political system with a fair amount of corruption, and a history of going after political opponents. It has got to be discouraging for them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re looking at the big picture of what is going on say in Syria, and with the U.S. pulling out so abruptly, how confident are they in (U.S. protections). They don\u2019t have any other options.\u201d\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TOLD CONGRESS HE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S UKRAINE DEALINGS IN 2015 BUT WAS IGNORED\n\nYulia Vovkodav contributed to this report.", "description": "Ukraine has been thrust into the limelight as the country of interest at the center of the\u00a0Democratic-led impeachment inquiry\u00a0in the United States \u2013 but inside the embattled country, that controversy has mostly been overshadowed by more pressing internal issues.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
