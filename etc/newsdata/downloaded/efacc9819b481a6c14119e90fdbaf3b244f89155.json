For extracts and topicals the maximum will be 1,000 mg per package.\n\nOne of the government\u2019s stated goals for the legal cannabis market was to undercut and eventually displace illicit sales.\n\nBut new government data shows only 29 percent of Canadians are buying pot from licensed retailers who, despite a small first-time price drop in the third quarter, charge an average of Can$10.23 per gram, or double the black market rate for cannabis.\n\nCannabis stocks, meanwhile, have lost half their value since peaking last year over missed revenue expectations blamed on a shortage of retail outlets and growing pains of a new industry.\n\nMany companies are hoping that higher-margin cannabis-infused foods and drinks will turn around their earnings slump.\n\nOne year on, the proportion of Canadians who use cannabis has remained unchanged at about 4.9 million out of a total population of 37.6 million, or about 13 percent, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nMen and youth continue to be the biggest consumers of pot.\n\nCanada became only the second nation to legalize recreational cannabis, after Uruguay, on October 17, 2018.", "description": "Montreal (AFP) \u2013 Canada\u2019s cannabis market \u2014 beset by complaints of high retail prices and huge investor losses \u2014 will take", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/54c71c_government-statistics-13-percent-canadians-are-pot-users-displacing-canada-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
