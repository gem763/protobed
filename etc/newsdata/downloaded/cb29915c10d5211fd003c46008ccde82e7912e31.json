As long as they are stored correctly, fresh chickens will almost always taste better than frozen, and the texture is firmer and less watery, too. So try to buy fresh local chickens instead of the flabby, tasteless, overgrown ones sold in supermarkets \u2013 they will make whatever dish you\u2019re cooking taste better.\n\nMost Hongkongers just go to the siu mei (roast meat) shop if they want soy sauce chicken, but it\u2019s also easy to make. The fresh local chickens I buy are the perfect size: 1.2kg. If you like, chop off the head, neck and feet before poaching the bird (it doesn\u2019t change the cooking time), then freeze them to use the next time you make chicken broth.\n\nChoose a cooking pot that is large and deep enough that the chicken has room to \u201cswim\u201d in the poaching liquid. It shouldn\u2019t be too wide though, because the poaching liquid needs to cover three-quarters of the bird.\n\nIn this recipe, the chicken is just poached, not sim\u00admered, which gives the meat a silky texture. I like chicken a little pink at the bones so for a bird that weighs 1.2kg, I poach it for an hour. If you prefer it fully cooked, poach it longer. If you have a larger chicken, you'll need to increase the cooking time. A chicken that weighs 1.5kg (53oz) will need about 1\u00bd to 2 hours to poach, plus an hour to cool in the liquid.", "description": "Not all chickens are created equal.
