Systems are not designed to raise our children,\" Ayala said in a Facebook post.\n\nOfficials didn\u2019t say what prompted the arrests, but one of the children's grandmothers told local television station WKMG-TV that it was because her granddaughter was acting out in class.\n\nPolice originally said the children were 6 years old and 8 years old, but corrected that Monday.\n\nRol\u00f3n had previously said the officer transporting one of the children realized approval hadn't been obtained and stopped the process \"immediately.\" The child was released back to the school before being processed at the Juvenile Assessment Center.\n\nThe other child was arrested in a separate incident. The student was later transported to and processed in a juvenile jail by an officer who was unaware the arrest hadn't been approved by a superior, Rol\u00f3n said. The child was released to family members shortly after.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller and N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @RyanW_Miller and @NdeaYanceyBragg\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Orlando police officer fired for arresting 2 children on misdemeanors", "description": "Chief\u00a0Orlando Rol\u00f3n said Officer Dennis Turner\u00a0didn't follow department policy requiring him to get approval before arresting minors\u00a0younger than 12.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
