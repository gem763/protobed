There is a G7 message on our objectives,\" Macron told French television, summarizing a discussion leaders had over dinner on Saturday night at the G7 summit he is hosting in the coastal city of Biarritz.\n\n\"We all agree on two very clear things: We do not want Iran to get the nuclear bomb and we do not want an escalation and destabilization of the region,\" he said.\n\nA French diplomatic official went further, saying the leaders \u2014 including Trump \u2014 had given Macron authority to speak to Iran's leaders and convey the joint message.\n\n\u201cG7 leaders agreed that [Macron], as president of the G7, could speak to Iranian authorities and send them a message on the basis of what was discussed at the dinner,\u201d the official said.\n\nBut, speaking to reporters on Sunday as he met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe at the summit, Trump did not sound quite on the same page. Asked if he had signed off on a joint statement that Macron will deliver to Iran from the G7 countries, he replied: \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t discussed that.\u201d\n\nAsked if he supports Macron\u2019s outreach to Iranian authorities, he replied \u201csure\u201d but added that he also supports Abe\u2019s contacts with Iran.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do our own outreach ... but we can\u2019t stop others from their outreach,\" he said. \"If they want to talk, they can talk.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Trump slapped down Macron on Twitter for his contacts with Iran, saying \"mixed messages\" are making diplomacy with Tehran harder.\n\n\u201cI know Emmanuel means well, as do all others, but nobody speaks for the United States but the United States itself,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNo one is authorized in any way, shape, or form, to represent us!\u201d\n\nThe comments from Macron and Trump in Biarritz highlighted that while Europe and the United States may have common objectives on Iran, they have deep differences over how to achieve those goals.\n\nTrump is pursuing a policy of \"maximum pressure\" on Tehran, having withdrawn from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal \u2014 negotiated by the Obama administration and European powers \u2014 and reimposed economic sanctions.\n\nThe EU and its signatories of the deal \u2014 France, Germany and Britain \u2014 have all stood by the pact, which offered sanctions relief in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program.\n\nFrance has taken a lead in recent months in trying to reduce tensions between Iran and the West, which diplomats fear could spill over into a military conflict. French officials have been seeking a way to allow Iran to resume exporting its oil for a limited amount of time, in exchange for Iran reversing its recent breaches of the nuclear deal.", "description": "French president hails joint message to Tehran but US leader says countries will do their own outreach.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1163805287-1200x628.jpg"}
