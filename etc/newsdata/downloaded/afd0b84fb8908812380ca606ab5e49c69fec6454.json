That effort culminated on Thursday with the release of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about those efforts, followed by a furious attempt to discredit the complaint.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the real whistleblower,\u201d declared Giuliani, who claimed to possess more damaging information and insisted that he, too, should be entitled to whistleblower protections. \u201cIf I get killed now,\u201d he warned, \u201cYou won\u2019t get the rest of the story.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the story goes back even further, to a long-running geopolitical saga and a bureaucratic turf war in Kiev. There, a group of Ukrainian prosecutors with grudges against Western-backed anti-corruption efforts found common cause with a network of President Trump\u2019s allies with a long history of digging up dirt on Democrats.\n\nOver several months, that volatile combination set off a chain reaction that is now roiling both capitals. It threatens to bring about Trump\u2019s impeachment and inflict collateral damage on the presidential campaign of Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden.\n\nPrologue\n\nFor years, Ukraine has found itself caught in a tug-of-war between the West, which wants it to embrace the rule of law, liberal democracy and a market economy, and Russia, which wants to reassert dominance over its former imperial possession.\n\nIn that contest, the toppling of Russia-aligned President Viktor Yanukovich in February 2014 was a blow to Moscow. It would also create problems for the ousted leader\u2019s American consigliere, Paul Manafort, and for Mykola Zlochevsky, a natural gas baron who had served in his cabinet.\n\nThe following month, Moscow responded by annexing Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula. Zlochevsky, meanwhile, found himself on the outs with the new regime and facing investigations at home and in the West. In April, he responded by putting Hunter Biden, whose father oversaw U.S. policy in Ukraine, on the board of his natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.\n\nIn September 2014, Ukraine\u2019s new president, businessman Petro Poroshenko, came to Washington to appeal for help repelling Russian incursions into eastern Ukraine, which had escalated in August. He warned a joint session of Congress that \u201cblankets [and] night vision goggles are also important. But one cannot win a war with blankets \u2026 and cannot keep the peace with blankets.\u201d\n\nIn October, as it sought to ingratiate itself with the West, Ukraine established the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, or NABU, pledging to clean up its notoriously dirty political culture.\n\nBut while Ukraine\u2019s new leaders were dependent on the West\u2019s military support and eager for access to its rich economies, they did not all share the West\u2019s enthusiasm for rooting out the country\u2019s endemic corruption.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Serhiy Leshchenko", "Ukrainian Politician", "Michele Flournoy", "Under Secretary Of Defense For Policy Under President Barack Obama"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5e/65/1d4c782744c5a479688ac8954e54/190926-giuliani1-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
