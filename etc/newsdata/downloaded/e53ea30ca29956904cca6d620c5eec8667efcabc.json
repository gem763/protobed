But by wiggling around the egg, embryos can find the \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d which means they are able to shield themselves against extreme thermal conditions and produce a balanced sex ratio, according to the new study published in Current Biology journal Ye et al/Current Biology 2/20 Elephant poaching rates drop in Africa African elephant poaching rates have dropped by 60 per cent in six years, an international study has found. It is thought the decline could be associated with the ivory trade ban introduced in China in 2017.

We need to determine who\u2019s doing it, where it\u2019s coming from and what their intent is. We need to try to find ways to prevent it from happening again.\u201d\n\nIn a 2017 interview with the New York Times, retired US Navy commander David Fravor described an encounter with a UAP in 2004 that left him \u201cpretty weirded out\u201d.\n\nThe strange, 40ft oval craft \u201caccelerated like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d after he approached it in his F/A-18F Super Hornet. A navy cruiser had been tracking the object and Cmdr Fravor encountered it hovering a short distance above the sea, over a \u201cboiling\u201d disturbance in the waves.\n\nAfter it disappeared Cmdr Fravor and his wingman were ordered to fly to a different area 60 miles away \u2013 but were told the craft had beaten them to it before they had travelled one-third of the distance. When they arrived, the object had disappeared.\n\nThe Times reported that Cmdr Fravor\u2019s account related to one of the three videos recently addressed by the navy.", "description": "Videos\u00a0said to have been captured by US fighter pilots and purporting to\u00a0show\u00a0UFOs are real military records of unexplained aerial encounters, the US Navy has reportedly said.
