His travel records show that he had landed in the country earlier that day and, hours after he was photographed, left the country again on an Emirates flight.\n\nDuduzane Zuma left just days before the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) sent him a letter asking him to supply them with reasons as to why he should not be prosecuted for culpable homicide.\n\nThe charge relates to the death of Phumzile Dube on the M1 highway in Sandton, Johannesburg, in February 2014. His Porsche crashed into the minibus she was travelling in. After an inquest, the NPA decided that Duduzane should not be prosecuted in connection with her death, but that has since changed.\n\nLast year, advocate Gerrie Nel, head of civil rights group AfriForum\u2019s private prosecuting unit, applied for a certificate of non-prosecution on behalf of the Dube family, so that they could pursue a private prosecution.\n\nNational Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams has since done an about-turn and informed AfriForum this week that he is reviewing his decision.\n\nIn a letter Abrahams sent to Zuma on February 2, he asks him to supply reasons he should not be prosecuted and to send them to him by the end of March. AfriForum head Kallie Kriel says they are overjoyed at the decision.\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for the Dube family, Gerrie Nel and AfriForum, but also for everyone in the country who is fed up that former president Jacob Zuma, his friends and his family have managed to duck prosecution because of the protection that the NPA offered them,\u201d\n\nhe said.\n\nA senior NPA official told City Press this week that former president Jacob Zuma is in the NPA\u2019s firing line. A decision to prosecute him is expected to be reached by Friday.\n\n\u201cHe will definitely be charged and no one will protect him. He is vulnerable and he won\u2019t survive all the charges. He has messed up big time,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe Gupta family\u2019s power was officially broken this week as the Hawks raided several of their properties, including their sprawling compound in Saxonwold, Johannesburg. But the Guptas had long gone and Ajay Gupta has officially been confirmed to be a fugitive.\n\nHawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi would not confirm the other suspects they were looking for by name, saying only they were \u201clooking for two suspects of Indian descent who are definitely abroad\u201d.\n\nHowever, other sources within the unit confirmed they want to take Atul and Rajesh in for questioning.\n\nThe Times of India reported that Ajay and Atul Gupta attended a Hindu ceremony in their hometown of Saharanpur, India, on Wednesday. Subsequently, sources in India told Rapport that Ajay and youngest brother Rajesh are expected to attend a wedding in India this weekend.\n\nAccording to the Hawks, Ajay Gupta\u2019s lawyer, Ahmed Gani, made an agreement to have him in the dock of the Bloemfontein Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday, but he didn\u2019t pitch up. Gani declined to comment.\n\nAlso not in court were Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, who loom large in the draft indictment against the Gupta family\u2019s employees, who appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrates\u2019 Court on Thursday.\n\nCity Press has learnt from a senior source in the security cluster that \u201cno politicians are targets\u201d in the Vrede dairy farm investigation.\n\nHowever, another senior source close to the probe hinted that they may be in the Hawks\u2019 sights after all.\n\n\u201cAny arrest of any politicians will take place during phase two of the investigation. We are just tying up some loose ends,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the accused is Seipati Dhlamini, Zwane\u2019s current chief of staff, who was chief financial officer of the Free State agriculture department at the time it was looted and when Zwane was its MEC.\n\nThe draft indictment provides insight into Zwane\u2019s involvement in the project, as well as that of his former boss and Free State premier Magashule.\n\n\u201cThe idea for the [dairy] concept \u2026 was that of the MEC of the Free State at the time, Mr Mosebenzi Zwane,\u201d the document states.\n\n\u201cOn June 15 2012, the MEC for agriculture contacted the MEC for finance to request that an urgent payment of R30 million be made to [Gupta-owned company] Estina and that the provincial treasury expedite the payment on the same day. This payment of R30 million was made at the time when the provincial treasury did not have the required amount available and there were concerns about the signed contract.\n\n\u201cThe contract between Estina and the Free State department of agriculture was referred to the legal services in the office of the premier in the Free State for advice and, on June 19 2012, it was stated that the procurement process was not followed and that therefore the contract may be invalid.\u201d\n\nThe project went ahead regardless.\n\nThe eight accused in the dock are former and current chief executives of Gupta-owned companies, including Oakbay boss Ronica Ragavan, her predecessor Nazeem Howa and Ashu Chawla.\n\nSince the Hawks confirmed that Ajay is a fugitive, the Hawks have been inundated with calls from the public, said Mulaudzi.\n\nSince yesterday, there have been rewards offered of R1.8 million for anyone who could apprehend the Guptas.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nWhat should be done to ensure the Guptas and Duduzane return to SA?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword JUSTICE and tell us what you think.
