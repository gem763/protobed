And while solid readings from more comprehensive hard data releases, such as the jobs report, didn't ring additional alarm bells, it wasn't strong enough to establish that the US economy is immune to pressure from the rest of the world.\n\nOn the other side of the tug of war, the policy hopes that have pulled stocks higher have shifted from central bank action to trade and other measures. This is not because investors have concluded that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates this year - it most likely will - but because they realise the cuts probably won't materially improve the economic outlook.\n\nRecognition is spreading among market participants that there is an important difference between a friendly central bank and an effective one. Moreover, in the case of the European Central Bank, such prolonged friendliness risks being counter-productive beyond a certain point.\n\nConsequently, the optimists now centre their hopes on the possibility of a US-China trade deal and fiscal stimulus in Europe led by Germany.\n\nSome feel that with President Donald Trump now facing possible impeachment, his administration will be more inclined to reach agreement with China - a partial deal - even if it falls short of the comprehensive and durable outcome for which many are hoping.\n\nThe coming visit of a Chinese trade delegation offers optimists a timeline for their hopes. Meanwhile, weakness in German economic data is seen by these optimists as the catalyst for significant fiscal stimulus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe growing strain between these two global factors increases the uncertainty for the worldwide economy and markets and threatens the \"unstable equilibrium\" that has persisted until now.\n\nFor investors, the situation challenges the sufficiency of the traditional approaches to diversifying holdings and mitigating risk. It increases the risk of unsettling volatility, multiple equilibria and the threats of mistakes that come with that.\n\nIn such a world, investors should consider, at the minimum, adding an element of \"regret minimisation\" to their portfolios. This means strongly emphasising balance-sheet strength and other quality considerations in selecting stocks, building a bigger-than-usual cash buffer in their asset allocation and shortening maturities on their corporate and government bonds.\n\nMohamed A.
