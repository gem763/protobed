He also said China is taking on the \u201cfull burden\u201d of U.S. tariffs on its products.\n\n\u201cAll these preposterous comments are not constructive at all, and go against the larger direction of the two sides taking real action to create favorable conditions for the negotiations,\u201d Beijing\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily wrote in a commentary Tuesday. Navarro intended to \u201cthrow cold water on international markets,\u201d it said.\n\nThose \u201cirresponsible\u201d comments should stop, and the U.S. should show \u201csincerity\u201d and \u201caction\u201d to create condition for the negotiations, the paper said.\n\nChina and the U.S. will hold face-to-face trade negotiations in Washington in the coming weeks, after a deterioration in relations last month left global investors reeling amid increasing evidence the conflict is harming both nations. The U.S. Agriculture Department\u2019s undersecretary for trade, Ted McKinney, also used provocative language on Monday, calling Chinese President Xi Jinping a \u201ccommunist zealot.\"\n\n\u201cIt is important for both China and the United States to grasp the opportunity of stabilizing bilateral trade and economic ties,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily commentary said, adding that the two countries should work together in the direction set by their leaders.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Miao Han in Beijing at mhan22@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net, Sharon Chen, Karen Leigh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
