For more information on Shea and his latest book, please click here.\n\nIt is a clear thing and an obvious thing that 1977\u2019s Annie Hall is the default movie to bring up when discussing Diane Keaton\u2019s brilliance. And rightfully so, given (1) she is brilliant in it; the kind of brilliant that defines a career; the kind of brilliant that somehow lives separate of all other things; the kind of brilliant so stuffed full of wit and charm and effervescence and humor that it nearly glows. And (2) the film carries with it the kind of historical gravity and influence and cultural symbolism that make it inescapable. And so I get that. And I understand that. And I get that. And I understand that.\n\nBut still: It is not my favorite Diane Keaton performance. Because my favorite Diane Keaton performance is the show she put on in 2003\u2019s Something\u2019s Gotta Give.\n\nA very quick synopsis of Something\u2019s Gotta Give: Jack Nicholson plays Harry Sanborn, a rich and successful 63-year-old man who has a habit of dating decades-younger women. He starts seeing a 29-year-old woman named Marin Klein (played by Amanda Peet). She takes him to her mother\u2019s house in the Hamptons for a weekend getaway. Her mother, a famous playwright named Erica Barry (played by Keaton), shows up shortly after, surprising them both. Several hours after everyone meets everyone, Nicholson and Peet are in their bedroom getting ready to (presumably) have sex. Nicholson has a heart attack during foreplay and collapses on the floor, and so Peet calls Keaton to help. Keaton ends up saving his life (she gives him CPR and also has Peet call for an ambulance). Peet, somehow just now realizing that her weekend boyfriend is over 30 years older than her, is wobbled by the experience and ditches Nicholson, who ends up getting quarantined in Keaton\u2019s Hamptons house until he\u2019s strong enough to travel. He and Keaton dislike each other in the beginning, but then Nicholson talks to Keaton for more than one minute and becomes enamored with her, because that\u2019s what happens when someone talks to Diane Keaton for more than one minute. And that\u2019s where things get thorny.\n\nA real quick aside before I continue, and this will help speak to the level of sophistication and glamour that Keaton has on display in the movie: In 2018, Nancy Meyers, the writer and director of Something\u2019s Gotta Give, was speaking at the Tribeca Film Festival. She told a quick story about how Diane Keaton was so dazzling as Erica Barry that Jack Nicholson thought she\u2019d really fallen in love with him. There\u2019s a scene in the back half of the movie where the two run into each other in New York (this is after they\u2019ve sort of broken up following their time at the Hamptons house together) and Erica gives this great speech to Harry about how she loves him. Jack, while she was doing it, was so overwhelmed by Keaton\u2019s performance that he thought she was saying it for real, as herself, and not as her character. And so he approached Meyers and told her that Keaton had just for real, in real life, as real humans with real emotions, told him that she loved him. Nicholson is often regarded as one of the all-time greatest actors in American cinema, and Keaton still had him so spun around that he forgot that he was in a movie with her while they were filming the movie.\n\nAt any rate, the rest of the plot of Something\u2019s Gotta Give:\n\nNicholson\u2019s Harry falls in love with Keaton\u2019s Erica (and she\u2019s pretty sure she loves him, too). But at the same time that that\u2019s happening, the doctor who is treating Nicholson, a 36-year-old Perfect Man played by Keanu Reeves, begins courting Keaton as well. And so that\u2019s what the movie is: It is, in effect, Diane Keaton accidentally making men fall in love with her, and then Diane Keaton being surprised that men keep falling in love with her, and then Diane Keaton trying to figure out which one of them it is she wants to be with, and then Diane Keaton reacting to the reverb of all it. And it\u2019s all so perfect. As she often is.\n\n18 Questions about Diane Keaton, None of Which Are About Something\u2019s Gotta Give What is it that makes Diane Keaton such a special actress? Is it because of how funny she is, or how charming she is, or how challenging she is, or how idiosyncratic she is? Is it because of the turtlenecks? The scarfs? The blazers? Is it her bangs? It\u2019s her bangs, right? Is it because of the way she talks about the way a bridge looks at night while sitting on a bench next to a neurotic creep-o? Is it because of the way she scans for Warren Beatty at a train station? Is it because she\u2019s so good at making applesauce? Is it because of the way she tells you that her hair is a wig? Is it because she stared down the mob? Is it because of the way she kisses a frog? Is it because of the way she gets out of a giant inflatable swan float when she\u2019s surprised by her daughters and the police? Is it because of the way she smiles when she\u2019s nervous, or the way she blows air out of her slightly scrunched-up nose when she\u2019s nervous, or the way her words somehow flutter around in the air for longer than anyone else\u2019s when she\u2019s nervous? Is it a combination of some of those things? Is it a combination of all of those things? Will there ever be another Diane Keaton?\n\nDoes Diane Keaton make the right decision in Something\u2019s Gotta Give? Because what ends up happening is she chooses Nicholson over Keanu, and it\u2019s not immediately clear if that\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nThings we know about Dr. Keanu:\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s handsome. Keanu has always had such a great face. He\u2019s not at his absolute most handsome here (the most handsome he has ever been was in John Wick: Chapter 2), but he is certainly trending toward it.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s tall. A steady six-foot-one. (For comparison, Keaton is five-foot-seven.)\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s (likely) good at kung fu. Immediately prior to appearing in Something\u2019s Gotta Give, he starred in the final installment of The Matrix trilogy. That means he probably had some kung fu residue still baked into his bones, which is either very important to you or not important at all to you.\n\n\u2022 His heart is in proper working condition. He has zero issues with his heart in the movie, unlike Nicholson, who seems to have a heart attack every 20 seconds.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s a doctor. He works in the ER. Were I to guess, I\u2019d say that puts his salary somewhere around $300,000. That\u2019s very good.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s young. He\u2019s 36, compared to Nicholson\u2019s Harry, who is 63. (Keaton\u2019s Erica is 56.) (Also: I wonder if Meyers decided to make Keanu\u2019s age and Nicholson\u2019s age a mirror of one another as a subtle way to imply that they are opposites.)\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s considerate. He seems to always say a nice thing or do a nice thing, no matter the circumstances. (The biggest example is when Nicholson shows up in Paris and Keanu, rather than punching him in the nose, invites Nicholson to sit down and join him and Keaton for dinner.)\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s advanced. There\u2019s a part where he reads her latest play right after she\u2019s finished it. He tells her that it\u2019s great, and then he makes a comment to her about how lucky she is that he\u2019s not intimidated by how talented she is.\n\nThings we know about Nicholson:\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s handsome, but he\u2019s \u201cfor an old man\u201d handsome. You have to add that qualifier in there. Nicholson is handsome in Something\u2019s Gotta Give, yes, but he\u2019s \u201chandsome for an old man.\u201d It\u2019s different.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s taller than Keaton, but shorter than Dr. Keanu. Five-foot-ten.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s (likely) bad at kung fu. He was in zero of The Matrix movies.\n\n\u2022 His heart is bad. It\u2019s like a jar full of mayonnaise and cigar smoke.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s (likely) richer than Dr. Keanu. He owns several businesses, including one of the largest hip-hop record labels in the country.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s old (but only in relation to Dr. Keanu, not in relation to Keaton). He\u2019s 63. That puts him 27 years older than Dr. Keanu (which is a lot), but only seven years older than Keaton (which is not a lot if both people are older than 45, but is a lot if both are younger than 25).\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s inconsiderate. For most of the movie, anyway. Sometimes it comes off as accidentally rude (like when Keaton is excited to find out that Nicholson was briefly engaged to Diane Sawyer, and Nicholson says, \u201cWomen your age love that about me\u201d), and other times it comes off as purposefully funny. (The single best example is when Keaton meets Nicholson for the first time. She comes home, sees him in her house, thinks he\u2019s robbing her place, and calls the cops. He says he\u2019s not robbing her, that he\u2019s there because he\u2019s dating her daughter. Right then, Peet walks in wearing a bikini and confirms it. Keaton says, \u201cYou\u2019re dating my daughter?!\u201d To which Nicholson responds, \u201cNow who would\u2019ve thought that would be worse news?\u201d)\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s not advanced. For most of the movie, anyway. It\u2019s the whole point of him dating young women.\n\nOn paper, Keanu seems like the obvious pick for Keaton. He is younger, seemingly happier, can have sex without having to check his blood pressure first, and still has what I would figure to be at least 40 more years of life activity ahead of him, should Keaton so choose to occupy it. But ultimately it just would not have worked, mostly for four reasons:\n\nFirst, he\u2019s approaching the thickest and most intense time of his professional career. He would not be anywhere near as available as Nicholson is (Nicholson is already rich enough that he never has to worry about work again if he doesn\u2019t want to). That\u2019s important.\n\nSecond, he\u2019s not as good at being in a conversation with as Nicholson (mostly all Keanu says in the movie is how much he adores Keaton, which I imagine would eventually get old). Keaton is at her best and most lively when she has someone to swat a conversational tennis ball back and forth with. It might be her most treasured thing. Nicholson checks that box off for her. Dr. Keanu does not.\n\nThird, the age difference is just too big. Him being 36 and her being 56 is fine right now, but that 20-year gap is going to be a problem when he hits 45 and she\u2019s up at 65, or when he hits 60 and she\u2019s up at 80.\n\nAnd fourth, and this is the most important part of all of this, but Nicholson really, really loves her. He goes on this entire journey of self-discovery after they have a falling-out because he knows that he has to be better than what he\u2019s been if he wants to be with Keaton, because he knows that she\u2019s too smart to fall for any of his regular tricks or schmoozing. He tracks down a bunch of his ex-girlfriends, asks them how they feel (or felt) about him, and then absorbs all of that and realizes how inept of a relationship partner he is, and has been.\n\nKeaton made the right decision. She mostly always does.\n\n15 More Questions About Diane Keaton, Except This Time They\u2019re All About Something\u2019s Gotta Give, and Also It\u2019s Actually Only One Question, And Also This Time It Gets Answered When is Diane Keaton the most charming in Something\u2019s Gotta Give? Is it the scene when she first meets Nicholson? Is it the scene when she and her daughters have dinner with Nicholson? Is it the scene when she doesn\u2019t notice any of Dr. Keanu\u2019s advances in the hospital? Is it the scene when she chats with Nicholson on Instant Messenger? Is it the scene when she and Nicholson both realize they like each other in the kitchen late that one night? Is it when she walks on the beach with Nicholson and she\u2019s wearing that hat? Is it when she stops making out with Nicholson to take his blood pressure before sex? Is it when she hears Nicholson ask to sleep in the bed with her? Is it after they first break up and she cries and cries and cries? Is it when she sees Nicholson in New York and runs out of the restaurant? Is it when Nicholson approaches her as she\u2019s getting her new play ready? Is it when Nicholson surprises her at the restaurant in Paris? Is it when she puts on Nicholson\u2019s glasses and he puts on hers? Is it when the two of them (fucking finally) meet up on that bridge at the very end of the movie? I don\u2019t figure it\u2019s any of those. I figure it\u2019s the scene when she has to give Nicholson CPR. She\u2019s in the kitchen with her other daughter and the two of them can hear Nicholson and Keaton\u2019s youngest daughter in the bedroom listening to Marvin Gaye. Then she hears her youngest daughter calling for her. Then she runs in there and sees Nicholson on the floor, assesses the situation, and hollers at the youngest daughter to call 911. Keaton gets down on her knees, and her other daughter asks her what she\u2019s doing. \u201cMouth to mouth,\u201d she says, and when she says it Nicholson makes a face like he doesn\u2019t want her to do it. She sees it, and sees him, and, separate of any of the kinds of playful dizziness or eccentric quirkiness that she often packs into her lines, she says, \u201cUgh! Youuuu fucking guy.\u201d It\u2019s all so perfect. As she often is.\n\nRelated", "description": "Author Shea Serrano discusses Diane Keaton\u2019s role in Something\u2019s Gotta Give in his new book Movies (And Other Things).", "authors": ["Shea Serrano"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/07-somethings-gotta-give-4.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
