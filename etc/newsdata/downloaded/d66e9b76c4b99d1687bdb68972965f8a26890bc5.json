Mike Dunleavy said in a statement.\n\nThe refuge in Alaska\u2019s northeast corner is the country\u2019s largest wildlife preserve and, nearly void of people and roads, may be the country\u2019s largest remaining pristine wilderness. It is now closer to widespread drilling than ever before with President Trump and Republicans in Congress pushing to use their window of power to give oil companies unprecedented access.\n\nThursday\u2019s finalized environmental impact statement represents a setback to environmentalists and Democrats still trying to fight a 2017 law that required the government to open the refuge for oil drilling.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the Democratic-led House approved a bill to repeal that mandate. It has little chance to go further this year, but opponents hope they might fare better if Democrats win the White House and Senate in 2020.\n\n\u201cThere are some places too wild, too important, too unique to be spoiled by oil-and-gas development,\u201d said Rep. Jared Huffman, the California Democrat who wrote the bill. \u201cThe Arctic Refuge\u2019s Coastal Plain is one of those special places.\u201d\n\nInterior Department officials said their findings suggest oil drilling can happen in the coastal plain at the northern tip of the refuge without spoiling the area. The plan they are moving forward with would allow the industry to disturb the earth for its drilling pads, processing plants and roads on just 0.01% of the refuge\u2019s 19 million acres. Massive pipelines that hover over the ground, however, are largely not counted toward that limit.\n\nThe plan will include a ban on any activity along the plain\u2019s biggest rivers and in its far northwestern corner to protect caribou calving grounds, officials said. These \u201cno surface occupancy areas\u201d will block all development on more than 350,000 areas.\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determinations may also block off future areas in later decisions on project permits, officials said.\n\nAnd for two months of the year, all work will be banned in an area that covers a little less than half the plain.\n\nOther options studied in the assessment would have blocked off double or almost triple the amount of land.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best option to comply with the law\u2014all of the laws,\u201d said Chad Padgett, state director for Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management in Alaska. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to strike a balance between development and resource protection and that\u2019s what this option does.\u201d\n\nCompleting the assessment now puts the administration on course to offer the first leases to oil companies by year\u2019s end, Mr. Padgett said. The law requires about a month waiting period now, and then another month after putting out a notice of sale, after which the lease sale can begin, Interior officials said.\n\nOpponents have been skeptical of the rigor behind the department\u2019s scientific assessment in part because of it completed the review in less than two years, much shorter than typical for reviews of this scope.\n\nFinishing the lease sale soon would be a big step forward for ensuring the refuge does see oil development. If Mr. Trump loses re-election in 2020 to an opponent who wants to block drilling there, a contractual obligation in place with an oil company would make it much harder to undo the drilling plan, legal experts said.\n\nThe environmental group Defenders of Wildlife criticized the plan for its potential to infringe on areas increasingly necessary to polar bears, especially pregnant mothers. The plain borders the Southern Beaufort Sea, a place where endangered polar bears are in especially sharp decline and expected to seek more living area on shore as climate change melts the sea ice they have relied on.\n\n\u201cThis Arctic National Wildlife Refuge leasing plan is another disgraceful example of the Trump administration\u2019s continued rejection of environmental law, sound science and the wishes of the American people in protecting wildlife and wild lands,\u201d Jamie Rappaport Clark, the group\u2019s president said in a statement. \u201cWe will see them in court for this reckless effort to turn this iconic American landscape into an industrial oil field.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel very comfortable we have a solid scientific document,\u201d Mr. Padgett said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of criticism this was rushed through. That\u2019s patently untrue.\u201d\n\nThe refuge has been controversial almost since its conception. It was originally protected by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 before Congress formally created the refuge in 1980. By then, prospects for major oil finds had drawn interest from major oil companies. Congress responded both with further protection and parameters for early studies of how much oil might be there and how safely drillers could reach it.\n\nA drilling program for the area became a long-sought dream for Alaskan lawmakers, who rely on oil revenue to bolster the state\u2019s economy and its government budgets.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, whose vote was seen as crucial to approving the tax overhaul in 2017, successfully pushed for language in the bill to start requiring oil-lease sales for most of the refuge\u2019s coast. It aimed to raise $1 billion in revenue to offset new tax cuts.\n\nThere were questions about that plan from the start. Shale drilling in more accessible parts of the country has vastly cut the industry\u2019s interest in remote, environmentally-sensitive Alaska. The shale boom also has helped spur a global supply glut, keeping prices low and reducing the urgency to find more domestic oil.\n\nBP PLC announced last month that it would exit Alaska after six decades, the latest blow to the state\u2019s oil industry.\n\nBut Erik Milito of the American Petroleum Institute insisted drilling was economically viable. \u201cThe potential for safe and environmentally responsible energy development in this area is incredibly large and a key part of a long-term vision for U.S. energy security,\u201d he said. \u201cResponsible access to the Arctic region is in our national security interest, with other nations like Russia, Canada and Norway already actively exploring the area.\u201d\n\nTo meet Congress\u2019s expectations, the lease sales would have to produce seven to 13 times the amount returned from leasing in neighboring regions of Alaska\u2019s North Slope, which averaged $194 an acre between 2010 and 2016, according to an analysis of federal data commissioned by the Alaska Wilderness League, which opposes refuge drilling. The group argues, among other claims, that returns so small wouldn\u2019t justify development that could degrade the refuge forever.\n\nOther critics have questioned whether Interior has acted in good faith in assessing environmental risks during a rush to start a leasing program while Mr. Trump is still president.\n\nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which represents government employees in environmental fields, unearthed a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service memo from 2018 that suggested Interior failed to include more than a dozen different environmental assessments that should have been important to drafting its Environmental Impact Statement.\n\nThe Interior official spearheading the Arctic Refuge, Joe Balash, resigned late last month and days later began a position at a company called Oil Search, which has recently become a major player in Alaska prospecting.\n\nSeveral states, common opponents of Mr. Trump, also voiced objections to the draft environmental assessment put out in December. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey led a coalition of 16 peers saying the draft failed to prove the region will draw enough activity to produce the $1.1 billion of targeted revenue, failed to consider alternatives to minimize environmental harm and failed to consider the implications for climate change.\n\nBroadly, drilling in the refuge appears to be politically unpopular. A Yale University poll taken in December 2017 as Congress considered opening the area for drilling, showed the idea was opposed by 70% of U.S. voters, including a slim majority of Republicans.\n\nWrite to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s action clears the way for lease sales to oil companies this year.", "authors": ["Timothy Puko", "Tim.Puko Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106711/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
