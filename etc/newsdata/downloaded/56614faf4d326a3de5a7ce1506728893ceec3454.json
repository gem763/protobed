And as much as I like to think of myself as a strong, secretive kitty with a purr as loud as a dog\u2019s bark, casual ageism slips in at every possible turn when a woman dates a younger man.\n\nAnd often, the mudslinging comes directly from your squad.\n\n\u201cHow old is this one, then?\u201d They ask.\n\nREAD MORE: Here's the most popular day for marriage proposals and it's still coming up for 2019, plus 3 women share their engagement stories\n\nCouples like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas get criticised for their age gap all the time. The actress, 36, her husband, 26, has in the past addressed this double standard publicly, telling InStylethat people have given her a lot of s--- for it, and still do.\n\nWhereas on the flipside no one questions the ages of our favourite couples when they \u2018make sense\u2019 in terms of social convention, for example Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, he is 7 years older. Then there is Queen Bey and Jay-Z \u2013 she is 37, he is almost 50.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s why so many marriages don\u2019t make it past 10 years, plus 3 divorced women share why they wish they had walked away sooner\n\nIt\u2019s much like when women go out and \u2018have sex like men\u2019, they\u2019re never praised, always shamed. The foot soldiers of the patriarchy punish them for disturbing the \u2018natural\u2019 power equilibrium, so to speak. It\u2019s just too weird for them to wrap their heads around. Except in porn.\n\nWhen I became single in 2017 at the age of 34 - after an 11-year relationship - my former boss gave me some dating advice: \u201cYounger men are fantastic.\u201d She met a guy at work \u2013 she was 36 and he was 26 at the time - they are now married and ridiculously happy.\n\nBut is this the exception or the rule?\n\nREAD MORE: 10 ways to make your marriage last - from 4 experts\n\nIn society at large, the proportion of homogamous couples (both spouses with the same age) decreased in the last 20 yearsand couples where the wife is older than the husband are less rare.\n\nHowever, shade is still being thrown in heaps.\n\nIs an older woman dating a younger man then in fact the very last taboo of dating? My friends didn\u2019t care if I dated a guy from a different race, whether I dated a girl, my boss or colleague, a guy with much less money or ambition than me \u2013 the only issue, so big this BIG ISSUE could almost be sold in magazine form at the traffic light, was my age.\n\nREAD MORE: Woman discovers her husband is married to someone else, plus he tells her to take his abuse 'like a wife'\n\nAnd, truly, older women going after younger men are not only seen in society as predators that stalk their prey ever so gently before going in for the kill. No. She is portrayed in porn like this, be it a more hyperbole, fetishized version of that, i.e. a sex-crazed Dominatrix type that likes to overpower men into willing submission; most of us cannot relate to \u201cHOT MILF seduces neighbour\u2019s 18-year-old son\u201d or \u201cCougar spanks college student for being late to class, again,\u201d type scenarios.\n\nAge-gap relationships have just as much chance of success as homogamous couplings in my opinion. Younger guys want to hook up with older women who are in their 30s, up to 40s and older. This interest has always been there, and now, potentially it\u2019s being stimulated an increased \u2013 sort of for the wrong reasons - because of the prevalence and acceptability of MILF fetish porn.\n\nI asked a 25-year-old medical marijuana engineer I went on a Tinder date with to be honest with me. What are these guys, him included, after? A relationship or just sex?\n\n\u201cThese guys hope you\u2019re going to be this woman who does all this kinky stuff to them. And then find out you are just a normal girl. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t stick around,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t complete the fantasy.\u201d\n\nDating younger guys was never just about sex for me \u2013 often that part was quite disappointing. But to them, it has become the only acceptable way to be with an older woman.\n\nMILF and cougar porn have normalised fetishizing older woman, showing that in 2019, older women dating younger men can only be deemed acceptable as a fantasy, largely reducing these age-gap relationships only to a sexual exchanges \u2013 crushing any potential for a meaningful relationship.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on age-gap love?
