John Garamendi, D-Calif, said on Fox Business Network Thursday that the trip mostly concerns the European Reassurance Initiative, which invests billions supporting European allies -- mostly in Eastern Europe -- in response to the Russian incursion into Ukraine. Garamendi is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on readiness.\n\nINTEL CHIEF MAGUIRE DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, CALLS ISSUE \u2018UNPRECEDENTED\u2019\n\n\u201cIn the intervening time we have the president pulling $770 million out of that program, and these are critical infrastructure so that our troops can actually engage if ever necessary in Eastern Europe, and of course we were going to do the Ukraine thing looking at the military support that we're giving,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that trip was planned four months ago, but noted that it has now become \u201call tied up in this impeachment issue.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to the controversy surrounding the newly revealed phone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. The transcript of the call was released this week after a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe allegation has escalated Democratic calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announcing a formal inquiry this week. Democrats allege that the call indicates a quid pro quo, with Trump holding military spending in return for an investigation into a political opponent. The transcript, though, does not show Trump explicitly linking the two. The money was eventually delivered.\n\nREAD THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT\n\nOn CNN Friday morning, Garamendi said the delegation is hoping to meet with political leaders in Kiev, including the defense minister, but said that \u201cgiven all of the disruption it remains to be seen exactly how that goes.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe question there is Ukraine is a critical ally. Ukraine has been invaded by Russia. What does all of this mean to Ukraine, how can we make sure that they get the assistance that they need to continue to push back against Russia and ultimately be successful and push Russia out of Ukraine?\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Garamendi also said that he believed a quid pro quo was relayed, and didn\u2019t rule out speaking to officials about the Biden matter. He has previously said he intends to \u201chold discussions on this matter and inquire about the conversations [Trump attorney] Rudy Giuliani and President Trump have had with Ukrainian leadership.\" However, he said the delegation has to be \"very very careful\" about the subject on the trip to the country.\n\n\u201cOnce again things are rapidly evolving here [and] what the Ukrainian government will do and how it will respond to what has got to be a major political issue for them back in Kiev remains to be seen,\u201d he said on CNN. \u201cAnd so we're going to be treading very carefully on the political side of this.\u201d", "description": "A congressional delegation will travel to Ukraine this week to meet with military leaders amid the\u00a0controversy over President Trump's July phone call with\u00a0the Ukrainian president -- though officials say the trip, planned before the details of that call were known, was originally meant to address other issues.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/27/694940094001_6089977836001_6089965176001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
