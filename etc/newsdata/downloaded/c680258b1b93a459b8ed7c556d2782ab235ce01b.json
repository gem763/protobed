Last year Nestl\u00e9 siphoned 45m gallons of pristine spring water from the creek and bottled it under the Arrowhead Water label.\n\nThough it\u2019s on federal land, the Swiss bottled water giant paid the US Forest Service and state practically nothing, and it profited handsomely: Nestl\u00e9 Waters\u2019 2018 worldwide sales exceeded $7.8bn.\n\nConservationists say some creek beds in the area are now bone dry and once-gushing springs are reduced to mere trickles. The Forest Service recently determined Nestl\u00e9\u2019s activities left Strawberry Creek \u201cimpaired\u201d while \u201cthe current water extraction is drying up surface water resources\u201d.\n\nNestl\u00e9 plan to take 1.1m gallons of water a day from natural springs sparks outcry Read more\n\nMeanwhile, the state is investigating whether Nestl\u00e9 is illegally drawing from Strawberry Creek and in 2017 advised it to \u201cimmediately cease any unauthorized diversions\u201d. Still, a year later, the Forest Service approved a new five-year permit that allows Nestl\u00e9 to continue using federal land to extract water, a decision critics say defies common sense.\n\nStrawberry Creek is emblematic of the intense, complex water fights playing out around the nation between Nestl\u00e9, grassroots opposition, and government officials. At stake is control of the nation\u2019s freshwater supply and billions in profits as Nestl\u00e9 bottles America\u2019s water then sells it back in plastic bottles. Those in opposition, like author and nutritionist Amanda Frye, increasingly view Nestl\u00e9 as a corporate villain motivated by \u201cgreed\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese are people who just want to make money, but they\u2019ve already dried up the upper Strawberry Creek and they\u2019ve done a lot of damage,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re a foreign corporation taking our natural resources, which makes it even worse.\u201d\n\nCritics characterize Nestl\u00e9 as a \u201cpredatory\u201d water company that targets struggling communities with sometimes exaggerated job promises while employing a variety of cheap strategies, like donating to local boy scouts, to win over small town officials who hold the keys to valuable springs.\n\nIts spending on lobbying and campaign contributions at the federal and state levels totals in the millions annually, the revolving door between the company and government perpetually turns, and it maintains cozy relationships with federal officials from the Forest Service to Trump administration.\n\nSuch tactics are partly what\u2019s behind the Forest Service\u2019s Strawberry Creek decision to allow Nestl\u00e9 to pull water from federal land, said Michael O\u2019Heaney, director of the Los Angeles-based environmental group Story of Stuff, which has sued to stop Nestl\u00e9.\n\nUltimately, the debates\u2019 particulars lead back to a question at the heart of issue: Should water be commodified and sold by private industry, or is it a basic human right?\n\n\u201cYou have Nestl\u00e9 spouting this idea of shared benefits and \u2018We\u2019re in it for the communities\u2019, but when you see the way they operate on the ground \u2013 they\u2019re very skilled at cozying up with legislators, state officials \u2026 and getting their way,\u201d he said.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters, which owns 51 brands including Ice Mountain, Poland Spring, and Zephyrhills, sees a much different reality. It presents itself as a responsible steward of America\u2019s water and an eco-friendly \u201chealthy hydration\u201d company aiming to save the world\u2019s freshwater supply.\n\nIt calls itself a job creator that invests heavily in local municipalities and contends it bottles a minuscule amount of the nation\u2019s water. Nestl\u00e9 resource manager Larry Lawrence insists the company obtained the right to Strawberry Creek\u2019s when it purchased Arrowhead, and says its science backs claims that it draws water \u201csustainably\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe argument that there should be some flowing stream bed [in upper Strawberry Creek] \u2013 we don\u2019t necessarily believe that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re testing for,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nNestl\u00e9 pays $200 a year to bottle water near Flint \u2013 where water is undrinkable Read more\n\nUltimately, the debates\u2019 particulars lead back to a question at the heart of issue: Should water be commodified and sold by private industry, or is it a basic human right?\n\nFormer Nestl\u00e9 CEO and chairman Peter Brabeck labeled the latter viewpoint \u201cextreme\u201d and called water a \u201cgrocery product\u201d that should \u201chave a market value\u201d. He later amended that, arguing 25 liters of water daily is a \u201chuman right\u201d, but water used to fill a pool or wash a car shouldn\u2019t be free. At its current pace, the world will run out of freshwater before oil, Brabeck said, and he suggests privatization is the answer.\n\nWhile conservationists agree that pool water could be subjected to fees, Nisha Swinton, senior organizer at the Food and Water Watch environmental group, says the public \u2013 not a company that \u201chas to appease their stockholders and make money on privatizing water\u201d \u2013 should be responsible for that.\n\n\u201cThis is not an issue for a multinational corporation to have control over \u2013 this is an issue for the public to hang on to and protect as their own,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Forest Service recently determined Nestl\u00e9\u2019s activities left California\u2019s Strawberry Creek \u2018impaired\u2019 while \u2018the current water extraction is drying up surface water resources\u2019. Photograph: Nick Todd/Alamy\n\n\u2018Quid pro quo arrangement\u2019\n\nThe source of America\u2019s corporate water crisis can be traced back to 1976 when Perrier, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, opened an office in New York. By 2016 bottled water sales had surpassed soda as the largest US beverage category, with Americans consuming 12.8bn gallons that year. Last year Nestl\u00e9 Water\u2019s North American sales were worth $4.5bn. As sales have grown, so has opposition. From California to Maine, residents and environmentalists are increasingly worried about Nestl\u00e9\u2019s impact.\n\nIn Fryeburg, Maine, resident Nickie Sekera says the small former timber town\u2019s fire department once offered a spigot from which residents could draw free water if a well ran dry or another problem necessitated it.\n\nThe fire department, however, replaced the spigot with free bottles of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Poland Spring water. Though it\u2019s a relatively minor change, Sekera said the symbolism is strong: \u201cIt speaks \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d\n\nSome Fryeburg residents have been attempting to dislodge Nestl\u00e9 since the early 2000s. Several rounds of fights played out at the ballot box and state court system \u2013 Nestl\u00e9 won most. In a recent legal challenge that went to the Maine supreme court, justices upheld a deal allowing Nestl\u00e9 to pull 75m gallons annually from a Fryeburg well for 45 years.\n\nAs part of its comprehensive Fryeburg public relations campaign, Nestl\u00e9 presents itself as longtime Maine label Poland Springs, which it acquired in 1992, instead of a Swiss multinational, Sekera said. It donated to the local boy scouts, bought the high school ski team new skis, and sponsored a fair, among other small acts.\n\nIn April, ahead of a Maine Legislature committee vote on new protections for state water, Nestl\u00e9 launched an approximately $1m Facebook ad blitz targeting the region.\n\nAccording to Food and Water Watch, Nestl\u00e9 or its lobbyists donated $634,000 to Maine politicians between 2001 and 2012.\n\nMeanwhile, Maine\u2019s regulatory apparatus is stacked with former Nestl\u00e9 employees or contractors. The Maine Public Utilities Commission was set to rule on the Fryeburg water deal in 2013 when it was revealed the three commissioners considering the case included a former Nestl\u00e9 lobbyist, attorney, and consultant. Former governor Paul LePage last year appointed a Nestl\u00e9 manager to the state\u2019s Environmental Protection Board, while former Nestl\u00e9 lobbyist Patricia Aho previously ran the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nAccording to Food and Water Watch, Nestl\u00e9 or its lobbyists donated $634,000 to Maine politicians between 2001 and 2012.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in bed together,\u201d Swinton said.\n\nSuch strategies are part of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s playbook. In Michigan, where the company is pumping 1,100 gallons per minute across several wells, it paid for new ambulances and fireworks for economically struggling communities. Evart Public Schools\u2019 superintendent Howard Hyde said in 2005 that he was \u201ctickled\u201d by Nestl\u00e9 funding new baseball diamonds for the district\u2019s baseball team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Christmas. Our current fields are pretty nice, but these are going to be better,\u201d he added.\n\nAnger boiled over in 2017 as residents in nearby Flint paid much higher rates for tainted water than Nestl\u00e9 did for clean water, and Detroit carried out mass water shut offs as its poorest residents got behind on bills. In response, Nestl\u00e9 donated bottled water to Flint.\n\nIn Oregon and Pennsylvania, local officials resigned following revelations they and Nestl\u00e9 worked in secret to attempt to push through unpopular water deals. Nestl\u00e9 scrapped its Pennsylvania plans while Hood River, Oregon residents voted out the company. It funneled $105,000 into a local political action committee ahead of the election.\n\nAt the national level, former Department of Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman serves on Nestl\u00e9\u2019s board, and documents Story of Stuff obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show the Forest Service chief is closely monitoring Strawberry Creek. Meanwhile, the Food And Drug Administration in 2017 determined Nestl\u00e9 was partly bottling groundwater \u2013 not spring water \u2013 in Strawberry Creek. The FDA abruptly reversed its position several months later after a former FDA regulator representing Nestl\u00e9 went to the company. Nestl\u00e9 is now fighting a lawsuit that alleges it is selling what is technically groundwater, which is different than spring water, and generally less desirable.\n\nThe Forest Service\u2019s Strawberry Creek permit decision references a 2017 Trump executive order that seems to speak to the controversy. It requires federal agencies to \u201censure that water users\u2019 private property rights are not encumbered when they attempt to secure permits to operate on public lands.\u201d\n\nFormer Forest Service special uses leader Gary Earney administered Nestl\u00e9\u2019s water permit between 1984 and 2007 and is now one of its most vocal critics.\n\nDuring that time, he witnessed \u201cdevastating\u201d Forest Service budget cuts that made it impossible to monitor Nestle\u2019s activities or properly manage the forest, but Nestle was there to help \u2013 it set up a nonprofit to solicit money for projects. Former San Bernardino national forest supervisor Gene Zimmerman, who left the agency in 2006 to work as a contractor for Nestl\u00e9, admits the company funded government projects in a 2015 video promoting Nestl\u00e9.\n\nEarney said he was once questioned by the FBI over possible corruption after it received a complaint about Nestl\u00e9 pulling water for only a $500 permit fee. Nestle capitalized on a financially weakened Forest Service, Earney said, but he doesn\u2019t believe it rose to the level of corruption: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Nestl\u00e9 had an informal quid pro quo arrangement with the Forest Service \u2013 by that I mean most likely unspoken.\u201d\n\nNestl\u00e9 spokesperson Alix Dunn defended the activities. She said it\u2019s important for elected officials \u201cto hear all perspectives when considering complex public policy issues\u201d and added that the company\u2019s generosity was being misrepresented: \u201cOur employees have been empowered to be, and will continue to be, active contributors in the improvement of their local communities\u2026.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Huff, chairperson of the zoning and planning commission for Osceola Township, stands before Chippewa Creek, shown flowing through a culvert.

A 7-mile system of 4in pipes carries water from it to tanker trucks at the mountain\u2019s base.\n\nLawrence notes the meadow is a green, lush area that bears use as a water source, and the sound of the flowing stream is drowned out by buzzing from mosquitoes \u2013 a sign of a healthy ecosystem.\n\nBut further up the mountain, the brush is more brown. There are few mosquitoes, insects, amphibians or other wildlife. Earney sees an ecosystem that \u201cshould be much more lush\u201d. Where Nestl\u00e9 sees a healthy environment, conservationists see one struggling.\n\nIn Fryeburg, the company\u2019s activities dried out wells and depleted the aquifer. It\u2019s proposing pulling 1.1m gallons daily from injured springs feeding the central Florida\u2019s Santa Fe River \u2013 four times what previous bottling companies took. The aquifer is draining because municipalities, agri-business, and bottled water companies are pulling from it, said Robert Knight, director of the Florida Springs Institute.\n\n\u201cWhen those springs are dying a death from a thousand cuts, one more cut isn\u2019t going to kill them, but it\u2019s not advisable to take more when they\u2019re showing all sorts of signs of stress,\u201d he said.\n\nA Michigan court ruled in 2003 that Nestl\u00e9 was solely responsible for draining the Dead River watershed from which it pulled 400 gallons per minute, or 210m gallons annually. The nine-year legal battle ended in 2009 when Nestl\u00e9 agreed to drastically reduce the amount of water it takes and monitor levels in real time.\n\nIn Strawberry Creek, the Forest Service is requiring a three-year study of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s impact on the watershed as part of the terms of the five-year permit it issued. \u201cAccusations are simple. Science is tough. We\u2019re doing the science,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nHowever, Nestl\u00e9 is conducting the study, which won\u2019t be made public. That worries conservationists, partly because it has a history of skewing results in its favor. An independent scientist Nestl\u00e9 hired was caught fabricating data during the 2003 Michigan trial, prompting the judge to issue a scathing opinion labeling him a \u201ccompany man\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maryann Borden, 73, speaks emotionally about the effects of Nestl\u00e9 Water\u2019s pumping over the last 15 years in Evart, Michigan. Photograph: Steven M Herppich/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u2018Backstop to protect public waters\u2019\n\nThe Dead River case represented a major victory for conservationists. Jim Olson, an attorney who fought it for Evart residents, underscored the water laws\u2019 importance, which he characterized as \u201cthe lynchpin on whether or not there\u2019s privatization of public water\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou have to be conscious of the legal framework and a subtle shifting toward privatization of water without you knowing it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe best and last line of defense is the public trust doctrine, Olson said, which he called the \u201cbackstop to protect public waters\u201d. It states that water is a public resource that the government is obligated to protect. In short, water can\u2019t be privatized, as Nestl\u00e9 is moving to do.\n\nStates\u2019 water laws are all similar gradations of the same principle. In Maine, absolute dominion is a type of law that allows landowners to draw unlimited water from the aquifer below a parcel. \u201cWhoever has the biggest straw can suck out as much water as possible. Even if your neighbors\u2019 well goes dry, you\u2019re not accountable,\u201d Swinton said.\n\nMost eastern states allow landowners to bottle water as long as there isn\u2019t \u201cmeasurable diminishment\u201d of water levels and flow, Olson said. He won the 2003 Dead River case by proving Nestl\u00e9 violated that rule. However, the Michigan court of appeals slightly shifted its interpretation of the law to favor Nestl\u00e9. Now, Michigan is closer to California and other western states, which allows landowners to lower water levels as long as downstream neighbors aren\u2019t seriously harmed.\n\nIt\u2019s likely the Strawberry Creek fight will be settled on that law, though Earney noted that an administration change in 2020 could push the Forest Service in a different direction. Regardless, he said, \u201cit will be a political decision or a technically correct decision\u201d.\n\n\u201c[The state] may fold because of political pressure from Nestl\u00e9, or they\u2019ll recognize that Nestl\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have a right to water that they\u2019re taking and do the right thing,\u201d he said.", "description": "Creek beds are bone dry and once-gushing springs are reduced to trickles as fights play out around the nation over control of nation\u2019s freshwater supply", "authors": ["Tom Perkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7448c8d1dcfff1633be19278acb4aec9f5e13cc/0_101_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=643e044344ad287560a9a4f6eb086484", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
