It absorbs more than 99% of visible light, removing almost all reflections, according to Levitation 29, the creative agency that collaborated with Surrey Nano Systems and BMW.\n\nLevitation 29 also claims that looking at the car can be \u201cinterpreted by the brain as staring into a hole or even a void.\u201d The blackness of the surface coating causes the human eye to see less defining features of the car and instead makes it appear two-dimensional. While this may cause the X6 to \u201close\u201d visible parts of the body design, other features, such as the Iconic Glow kidney grille, are accentuated.\n\nRead more: Bugatti\u2019s new $18.7 million hypercar was purchased by an anonymous buyer, making it the most expensive new car ever sold\n\nThe project, starting from its conception, took 10 months to complete.\n\n\u201cThe first Vantablack car is certainly a big tick in the box when it comes to dream projects and opens the way for even more large-scale concepts \u2013 like a stadium!\u201d said Levitation 29 Director Benjamin Males.\n\n\u201cTo create the effect of infinite darkness on that scale would truly be spectacular.\u201d\n\nTake a look at the world\u2019s blackest car:\n\nBMW is celebrating the launch of the next generation of the X6 SUV by painting the car with the Vantablack VBx2 coating.
