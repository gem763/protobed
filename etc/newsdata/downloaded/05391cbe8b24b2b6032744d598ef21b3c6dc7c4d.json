The French prankster who crashed Chanel's runway at Paris Fashion Week this week has revealed more details about the viral and controversial stunt\n\nPuff! 28-year-old Marie Benoliel, known as Marie S\u2019Infiltre, said she initially planned to smoke a cigarette on the runway \u2014 but Gigi Hadid's swift action in escorting her out foiled her plan\n\nHow dare she! Marie also called the supermodel 'rude' for escorting her out of a presentation where she didn't belong\n\nIn addition to seemingly holding a grudge against Gigi for preventing her on-stage puff, Marie also called the supermodel 'rude' for escorting her out of a presentation where she didn't belong.\n\n'She was rude,' she said, seemingly without any sense of irony.\n\n'Then, after, there were three models that wanted to fight. I didn\u2019t understand why she was like this, so aggressive. Of course she doesn\u2019t know me. I can understand that she wanted to protect her friends.'\n\nShe added, however, that she thinks she and Gigi could be friends now.\n\n'I think it\u2019s really funny and I love Gigi and I think now we can be close friends. She thought I was a crazy girl. But she\u2019s right. She\u2019s right actually,' she said.\n\nMarie also defended her actions, saying that fashion should be 'joyful' and 'has to make people happy,' adding: 'I think nowadays fashion doesn\u2019t make people happy. It makes people ridiculous and pretentious.'\n\nThe YouTuber also shared details of just how she managed to pull off the stunt, explaining that she borrowed a Chanel suit that her mother had purchased in 1986, ensuring she'd look the part.\n\nOf Gigi, she said: I didn\u2019t understand why she was like this, so aggressive. Of course she doesn\u2019t know me. I can understand that she wanted to protect her friends'\n\n'I think it\u2019s really funny and I love Gigi and I think now we can be close friends. She thought I was a crazy girl. But she\u2019s right. She\u2019s right actually,' she added\n\n'I look like a grandma with the suit but I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s Chanel,' she said. 'Bye bye, Lily Rose. Bye bye, Cara Delevingne. I\u2019m here.'\n\nShe had no invitation for the event, and fashion shows \u2014 particularly big ones like Chanel \u2014 have tons of security with people ensuring that everyone who walks in is supposed to be there.\n\nSo she waited for it to get especially busy, getting turned away three times before finally making it in.\n\nShe has no qualms about sneaking around.\n\n'I\u2019m really used to lying. It\u2019s part of my work,' she said. 'I hate people who say \"you\u2019re good, you\u2019re bad.\" I don\u2019t care about this.'\n\nSpeaking to Elle.com on Wednesday, Marie said that Gigi was 'quite aggressive' toward her, adding: 'She clearly did not understand my comic approach.'\n\nShe said she thought Gigi was going to pull her hair and yell at her 'as if we were school girls.'\n\nThe Youtuber added, though, that has no hard feelings about what happened.\n\n'Prank': On the first day of PFW, she managed to get on the runway at the ETAM show, where she walked behind lingerie-clad Cindy Bruna wearing a silver sparkly bustier and shorts\n\nHistory repeating: She cropped up on the runway at the Etam show on the first day of the week at the Roland Garros stadium, scantily dressed in a bra and hot-pants (left)\n\nThis is funny now? The YouTuber is clearly reveling in the attention she is getting\n\n'Gigi is obviously sublime and a fashion icon and I understand her reaction somewhat and continue to love her in spite of that,' Benoliel said.\n\nShe went on to say that she has drawn inspiration from British satirist Sacha Baron Cohen and that she likes to 'immerse myself in public events or situations... to show how funny some situations and sometimes extreme behaviors are.'\n\nShe explained: 'I am not making fun of people, I am pointing how silly some people can be when they lack distance and thinking.'\n\nTuesday's incident marked the second time that Benoliel, who currently stars in a one-woman show at the Com\u00e9die des Champs Elys\u00e9es theatre, crashed a fashion week event this week.\n\nShe popped up on the runway at the Etam show on the first day of the fashion week at the Roland Garros stadium, scantily dressed in a bra and hot-pants.", "description": "On Monday, 28-year-old Marie Benoliel, known as Marie S'Infiltre, ran up onto the runway at Chanel's show at Paris Fashion Week.
