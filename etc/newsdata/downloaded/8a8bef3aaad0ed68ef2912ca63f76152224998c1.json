Perhaps Prime Minister Scott Morrison had Beijing\u2019s arsenal in mind when he forcefully reminded during his speech to the Lowy Institute that, even while the world has been getting richer and state-on-state wars much rarer, \u201ctimes of tension and disruption\u201d are still more normal than not. Populism, trade warfare and global warming might top the current worry list, but new great power rivalries are up there too.\n\nIt is the reason for Australia\u2019s greatest peacetime defence spend of $200 billion, of which $90 billion is for 12 long-range submarines and a fleet of heavily armed frigates and destroyers able to work with allies across the Indo-Pacific. \u201cWe are investing in this capability because we must,\u201d Defence Minister Linda Reynolds will tell a naval conference in Sydney today. Power has moved to this part of the world, and the military \u2013 which has to think the unthinkable over time spans of many decades \u2013 needs to be prepared. The Parliamentary Budget Office says our defence outlay will double over the next decade, passing the West\u2019s usual 2 per cent spending benchmark. It is still worth it. The only good wars are ones that never happen, because we ensured that the human and material cost would be too high. As strategist Hugh White writes ominously of China in his recent book How to Defend Australia, \u201cNo nation\u2019s appetite for influence has ever shrunk as its power grew\u201d. Investing in Australia\u2019s armed forces will help make sure that \"influence\" never turns into \"coercion\".\n\nChina is the new superpower presence in the Asian region. AP\n\nChina has made huge progress in naval size and sophistication in just a couple of decades. This is understandable as it has worldwide trade and interests to protect. But its territorial grab in the South China Sea is highly provocative: what would be the reaction if Italy, for example, claimed the Mediterranean Sea for itself? Without America\u2019s traditional air power, China has gambled on a huge asymmetric advantage in cheaper ballistic missiles that would keep the Americans out of the western Pacific \u2013 hitting aircraft carriers with no warning, or even threatening an escalation to first strikes on the US itself. Of course experimental hypersonic anti-ship missiles may not work as advertised, and the US will counter with electronic warfare, lasers and its own new missiles. Some even fear that this makes the coming decade more dangerous, as China may lash out in the region before the missile technology window closes.\n\nOur American ally's defence budget is seven times larger than the next seven spenders combined. But it is spread thinly, and both Russia and China could strike suddenly with superior force in their own neighbourhoods. The obvious arms build-ups by Moscow and Beijing have driven higher defence spending in response in Europe, Asia and Australia, which might seem counter-productive. But neither is seeking head-on war when they can get what they want by intimidation, blackmail and brinkmanship, as they have been doing in Ukraine, the Baltic region and the South China Sea. The best response is a clear demonstration of resolve and will, with armed capability that makes it obvious that overstepping the mark would be folly.\n\nProfessor White believes that in the last ditch, the US will not risk all to protect its Pacific allies. The best defence course for Australia is to make itself self-sufficient behind a wall of 24 much smaller submarines, more F35s and even nuclear weapons. The other projects could be cancelled. Defending close to home reduces the risk of escalation, he says, always a danger in confronting bigger powers. But this kind of maritime Maginot Line lacks any flexibility, and may have less deterrent effect than a fleet that can go forward. It is like a soccer team playing with 10 full-backs; not a tactic likely to win many games in the long run. We would be unable to co-operate with others, or protect long supply lines for any length of time. The same goes for those who think our current defence projects are too big, too expensive, and too slow to deliver in a fast-moving world of drones and cyber warfare. Yet the real value of both of those things will be extending the reach of Australia\u2019s new manned platforms.", "description": "Investing in Australia's defence capability will help ensure we never have to respond to coercion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ce4ed94f943924f50a96c84e7f305cff69e28fa8", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
