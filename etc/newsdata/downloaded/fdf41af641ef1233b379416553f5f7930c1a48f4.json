Earlier this year, a new study, published in The Lancet medical journal, suggested the risk of users contracting breast cancer could be double what was previously thought. I started taking HRT aged 48. One freezing January morning on my way to work, a particularly bad hot flush led me to open a window on the bus.\n\nClaudia Connell (right) tried out former intensive care nurse Dr Wendy Sweet's (left) 12-week plan aimed at reducing menopause symptoms\n\nWhen a fellow passenger closed it, I launched a torrent of hot, sweaty abuse at the poor fellow. At the time, I decided I had two choices: take HRT or face a jail term for GBH. Although it hugely alleviated my symptoms, by the age of 53, I was worried about how dependent I was on it. Every time my GP suggested coming off it, I\u2019d have a mild panic attack.\n\nSo, when I read that one pioneering menopause expert had compiled a programme for women who wanted a more natural approach to getting through the menopause, with a view to eschewing or coming off HRT, I sat up and listened.\n\nDr Wendy Sweet started out as an intensive care nurse in New Zealand before training and lecturing in sport, health and nutrition. She was doing a doctorate on women\u2019s healthy ageing when her own menopausal symptoms kicked in.\n\n\u2018I kept reading all these stories about being \u201cfabulous at 50\u201d and thinking: \u201cWhy am I not fabulous at 50?!\u201d\u2019 she told me, when she was over in London delivering a lecture.\n\n\u2018Despite upping my exercise regime, I had piled on weight, my knees hurt, I couldn\u2019t sleep and I felt and looked awful.\u2019\n\nIt included re-vamping Claudia's routine and quitting her box-set binge habit, so that she was in bed by 10pm every night and ready to go to sleep\n\nWendy\u2019s research led her to conclude that no one was joining the dots when it came to women\u2019s menopausal symptoms and their lifestyles. No one was linking diet to hot flushes, exercise to lack of sleep, poor sleep to weight gain, and coming up with a solution.\n\nShe devised a 12-week online programme, My Menopause Transformation, after years of research into what she calls \u2018untangling the menopause mayhem jigsaw\u2019.\n\nMy Menopause Transformation, or MyMT, offers two plans: there\u2019s a \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 programme for symptom relief, and then there\u2019s a plan for women like me, who\u2019ve piled on the pounds in middle age, called \u2018Transform Me\u2019.\n\nNo one was linking diet to hot flushes, exercise to lack of sleep, poor sleep to weight gain, and coming up with a solution\n\nThe plan meant a total diet overhaul, early bedtimes and exercise, during which, if I was brave enough, I would attempt to wean myself off my HRT medication.\n\nIt all starts in the bedroom because, as far as Wendy is concerned, no menopause transformation can take place unless we get a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nBefore menopause I could sleep like the dead and, while HRT stopped the night sweats, it didn\u2019t stop me waking in the middle of the night with a wildly racing heart.\n\nI\u2019ve always gone to bed late (typically 1am) and get up at least once in the night to use the loo. Wendy\u2019s sleep programme aimed to turn around my body\u2019s circadian rhythm (our natural sleep/wake cycle) and I quickly learned that my 1am bedtime was far too late.\n\nMENOPAUSE BEATING FOOD RULES Dr Wendy Sweet recommends the following diet as part of her MyMT programme. FOODS TO AVOID: Sweets, sugar (if it ends in OSE it's a sugar), processed foods, beef, potatoes, apricots, figs, papaya, watermelon, dairy products, white rice and flour. Dr Wendy Sweet, using a plan based on the Mediterranean diet, recommended eating Asparagus, avocados and broccoli FINE IN MODERATION: Coffee and black tea (up to 2 cups a day and only in the morning), lamb, beetroot, leeks, sweetcorn, sweet potato, grapefruit, raisings, kiwi fruit, alcohol. EAT MORE: Carrots, garlic, aubergine, parsnip, peas, onions, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, brown rice, eggs, oats, quinoa, pulses, nuts. EAT PLENTY OF: Asparagus, avocados, broccoli, celery, kale, green beans, peppers, mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, spinach, lettuce, free-range chicken, fish, tofu, tempeh. Aim to eat fruit in the morning to avoid afternoon/evening sugar spikes. And have a mixture of cooked and raw vegetables daily.\n\nOur bodies are designed to be in their deepest sleep at 2am (when I was still looking at my phone screen).\n\nWe also start to secrete melatonin (the sleep hormone) at 9pm and our bodies need darkness to do this efficiently \u2014 not, like me, to be in front of the TV with a main light on.\n\nA poor night\u2019s sleep fires up our stress hormone cortisol, which fires up our appetite, and my 35in waist was the result.\n\nOn Wendy\u2019s plan, I quit my box-set binge habit and headed to bed at 10pm. As mammals, our bodies and hormones are programmed to love routine. My phone was left downstairs and replaced with an alarm clock, as the \u2018blue light\u2019 generated by smart phones interferes with our melatonin production.\n\nClaudia was also required to have a cold shower before bed - something she says she is still not used to - and to cut meat from her diet\n\nMeat was also banned from my evening meal. Our bodies have to work harder to break down meat proteins, leading to a rise in blood pressure, temperature and heart rate \u2014 not things a menopausal lady needs to be encouraging at bedtime.\n\nWendy believes uninterrupted sleep is key, meaning those 4am trips to the loo had to stop, so I stopped drinking liquids from 8pm.\n\nWhen I woke in the night with a racing heart, I practised a deep-breathing technique called \u2018diaphragmatic breathing\u2019.\n\nThis method is said to lower heart rate, get you quickly back to sleep and train the body out of thinking your bladder needs emptying.\n\nAfter three months I can report, I\u2019ve become an early-night convert and find my body springs into life naturally at around 6am.\n\nWe\u2019re allowed one lie-in a week, which helps with nights out, but even if I meet friends for dinner I am usually in bed by midnight.\n\nDr Wendy Sweet is a former intensive care nurse who worked in New Zealand\n\nIn the first six weeks, I still needed the loo in the night and the menopausal heart palpitations lingered, but for the past six weeks I\u2019ve slept through soundly.\n\nThe thing I\u2019ll never get used to is the cold showers. Yes, that\u2019s right, like some archaic boarding school ritual, the programme calls for cold showers before bed.\n\nIf we can keep our body core temperature low at bedtime, it means our thyroid and pituitary glands don\u2019t have to leap into action during a hot flush \u2014 yet another thing that tampers with the production of melatonin.\n\nWhen I started my cold showers, I only managed five seconds. Now I\u2019ve built up to 15 and have to report that ne\u2019er a hot sweat has troubled my cotton sheets in two months.\n\nAnother reason for the early nights is that, on the programme, we are encouraged to start every day with a walk. The melatonin we need to sleep well is stimulated via sunlight hitting our retinas, which means my habit of swanning around in sunglasses like some B-list movie star wasn\u2019t doing me any good.\n\nIt\u2019s important to leave sunglasses off for about 15 minutes in morning light, and even if it\u2019s not sunny, natural light will still stimulate melatonin production.\n\nGetting up at 6am gives me an hour before I need to get ready for work. I aim for 20 minutes of brisk (sunglasses-free) walking, but I admit I only do it in the pouring rain at weekends. Wendy encourages participants to aim for at least an 80/20 rule on her programme \u2014 if you\u2019re following the rules 80 per cent of the time, you\u2019re not doing badly.\n\nDuring the 12-week programme, exercise is gentle (with walking, cycling and swimming recommended) and designed to be \u2018healing and not harming\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s not a problem I was ever likely to have, but menopausal women who follow punishing workout regimes could be making their symptoms worse. A gruelling workout can result in cortisol levels soaring, leading to a bad night\u2019s sleep and no chance of recovery for those poor, overworked muscles.\n\nWhile changing my bedtime routine and going for walks took adjustment, it was always the diet overhaul that was going to test me.\n\nYou may question why anyone needs to change what they eat in menopause, but few realise that oestrogen is the most powerful anti-inflammatory in a woman\u2019s body.\n\nGentle exercise, such as walking, cycling and swimming, is also part of the plan. (stock image)\n\nWhen oestrogen levels decline, it results in deep tissue inflammation from higher cortisol levels, that in turn spikes insulin which makes us crave sugary and starchy food.\n\nWhen devising her food plan, Wendy studied the diets of women living in so called \u2018Blue Zones\u2019 \u2014 areas in the world where people live longer and suffer fewer medical conditions.\n\nA study of women\u2019s ageing in Blue Zones found that many reported a symptomless menopause and they certainly weren\u2019t taking HRT, so what was their secret? The thing the women all had in common was that their diets were very similar \u2014 they featured little meat and dairy, no processed foods and an abundance of fruit and vegetables.\n\nI started the diet overhaul with gusto by throwing all sugary and processed foods into a bin bag\n\nWendy based her diet plan on the Mediterranean diet, but with a few tweaks for menopausal women.\n\nA study by the American Journal of Clinic Nutrition discovered that those who followed the Mediterranean diet experienced a 20 per cent reduction in hot flushes.\n\nIn other words, the foods she advocates have a low glycaemic level as well as being low acidity.\n\nThese foods slow the release of insulin and sustain energy levels.\n\nOur bodies strive constantly to maintain a state of homeostasis \u2014 the perfect balance of hormones \u2014 and a healthy diet goes a long way towards aiding that.\n\nAs the programme I followed aimed to help me shift weight, it incorporated a liver cleanse. Oestrogen decline makes our livers less efficient, which means we don\u2019t metabolise fats and proteins well, leading to the dreaded middle-aged bloating.\n\nI started the diet overhaul with gusto by throwing all sugary and processed foods into a bin bag.\n\nFood recommended is based on the Mediterranean diet, and includes free-range chicken, fish and tofu. Nasty sweets, sugars and processed foods are best avoided. (Stock image)\n\nOut went the breakfast cereals, the crisps, the wine gums and the Diet Coke. I also binned dried penne and a half-eaten loaf of bread, since I was to eliminate wheat for six weeks. The reason for this is that wheat inflames the small intestine and reduces the amount of vitamins and minerals that are absorbed from food.\n\nWendy also wanted me to cut out beef, which is reported to make the body more acidic. Osteoporosis is linked to highly acidic diets.\n\nAs a tea guzzler, the bad news was that dairy was out, too. Dairy contains oestrogen-mimicking substances which push up insulin levels and will add another spare tyre to the one I was carrying.\n\nLower progesterone levels lead to water retention, so the diet plan called for two litres of water a day. It may sound counterintuitive, but water retention is due to the body panicking and holding on to liquids when dehydrated, so taking in more liquid alleviates the dehydration and the problem.Wendy prefers mineral water, but I went for the good old tap variety.\n\nThe golden rule was that I had to start every day with the juice of one fresh lemon to cleanse the liver, which may sound daft when you\u2019re trying to reduce acid, but lemons turn alkaline when they enter the body.\n\nIncluded in the programme is a long list of foods to eat: rarely, moderately, regularly and often.\n\nIn order to not get overwhelmed, I whittled that down to my own shortlist of food I liked and made my choices from there.\n\nSmoothies also featured in the natural plan to beat the menopause, including a green juice, but Claudia steered clear of this saying she didn't want to eat 'like a toddler'. (Stock image)\n\nMany women on the programme start their day with a green juice, but I knew that juicing would be a road to failure. Just as Shirley Conran famously once said that \u2018life\u2019s too short to stuff a mushroom\u2019, I believe it\u2019s also too short to peel and blend a kiwi.\n\nJuicing is a faff, washing the juicer afterwards is a headache. I\u2019ve thrown away \u00a3150 juicers because I\u2019m too lazy to wash them, so I settled on a solid food diet. Besides, I was already following a toddler\u2019s bedtime routine \u2014 I didn\u2019t want their diet as well.\n\nI start most days with either mixed berries or porridge and a bucket of coffee with a dash of oat milk. Now coffee does trigger hot flushes. But I don\u2019t care, I can\u2019t give it up. But I rarely have tea just because no non-dairy milk goes with it.\n\nI eat my biggest meal at lunchtime, which usually features either chicken or fish and vegetables or salad. When I\u2019m working, Pret a Manger\u2019s salmon with red cabbage and avocado salad box has been my life-saver.\n\nAnd you know those infuriating people who batch cook a load of healthy food at the weekend and then eat it during the week? I\u2019ve become one of them. My go-to recipes are a Quorn chili con carne, an aubergine and cannellini bean stew and a chicken and ginger stir fry with vegetables. And it gets worse: I also carry little bags of nuts and dried fruit around with me to snack on.\n\nWhen it comes to alcohol, I\u2019ll have a white wine when the mood takes me, but I can happily go days without drinking.\n\nAfter six weeks of no wheat, I introduced bread again and one round of toast resulted in a bloated belly rarely seen outside the world of professional darts.\n\nNow I don\u2019t eat bread or pasta at all, and my sugar cravings are firmly under control. When my train was subject to delays at Victoria Station recently, I stress-bought a packet of wine gums, but instead of scoffing the whole lot, I ate two and binned the rest.\n\nAfterwards Claudia said that she is no longer reliant on HRT pills and, although her menopause symptoms come back, they are no where near as strong as before. (Stock image)\n\nBut the big question is whether following the programme made me feel brave enough to come off my HRT? After seven weeks of dithering on the programme, I bit the bullet and consulted my GP about tapering off it.\n\nAt the start of the programme, I was using two pumps of oestrogen gel, rubbed into my arm daily. And for 12 days a month I took progesterone tablets.\n\nI felt great doing the programme, but how did I know that it wasn\u2019t still the HRT that was keeping the menopause\u2019s worst symptoms at bay? There was only one way to find out. On my doctor\u2019s advice, I reduced my oestrogen gel to one pump a day, then one every other day until finally, after two weeks, I stopped altogether. I felt genuinely anxious and requested another prescription \u2018just in case\u2019.\n\nAfter a week, I noticed hot flushes creeping back, but with nothing like the ferocious intensity I had experienced pre-HRT.\n\nWhen I get them they are usually triggered by caffeine and last a few seconds. The night sweats have not returned \u2014 thank goodness all those cold showers weren\u2019t in vain!\n\nAnd now the big news: after three months on the diet, my stomach has deflated like you wouldn\u2019t believe. I\u2019ve lost nearly five inches around my middle and 18lb (over a stone!) in weight.\n\nI\u2019m about to enter my fourth HRT-free week and, so far, I haven\u2019t needed to break into my emergency supply.\n\nI\u2019ve never been anti-HRT \u2014 I\u2019ve recommended it to many friends \u2014 but, like a stale relationship, it felt as though the time was right for us to go our separate ways. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised it wasn\u2019t the painful break I was expecting.", "description": "Claudia Connell took part in a 12-week natural programme to wean her off HRT and cure her menopause symptoms.
