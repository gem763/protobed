I\u2019m sure he is going to have a big career here,\u201d Emery told reporters ahead of Thursday\u2019s Europa League clash against Standard Liege.\n\n\u201cHe needs time... a lot of players when they came here, the first month, the first year is not easy for them. But I\u2019m going to work with him to make that adaptation easier.\u201d\n\nPepe\u2019s only goal came from the penalty spot in last month\u2019s 3-2 win against Aston Villa but Emery said the forward must look at any pressure that he was facing as a privilege.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a privileged player to be here as I\u2019m a privileged coach... and we are playing to achieve something important. It\u2019s demanding but I\u2019m not feeling pressure as a negative thing. I\u2019m very demanding to push players,\u201d Emery said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a great team and we have a big responsibility but it is positive. If we can do that, we\u2019ll be able to achieve good things, big things... it\u2019s natural to play under pressure.\u201d\n\nEmery brushed off questions on whether Pepe\u2019s transfer fee was a burden on him.\n\n\u201cThey are human, every player. When they are here working, playing, with us... we don\u2019t want and it is not relevant for us to speak about the money,\u201d the Spaniard said.\n\n\u201cNot for him, not for another, young player or experienced players. Salaries are not important for me. They are players, they are human and they play not thinking about that.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal's Nicolas Pepe may have had a slow start to life at the north London club but manager Unai Emery is prepared to go the extra mile to help unlock the Ivorian forward's potential.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436528522&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920B3"}
