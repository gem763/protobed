Because that's how much the classic British dish was sold for at Tom Kerridge's Bar and Grill at the Corinthia Hotel in London.\n\nAnd according to the Michelin-starred chef, the figure is \"easily justifiable\".\n\nSpeaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the 46-year-old explained just what went into his luxury take on the seaside favourite - including fresh dayboat turbot, the finest quality potatoes and a fruit Matson sauce.\n\nThe Guardian reports he said: \"If you break it down, it is easily justifiable.\n\n\"From my point of view, fish and chips is one of the greatest dishes in the world. There are Japanese three-Michelin star restaurants that are doing tempura, that are specialising in amazing pieces of fish that are deep fried and served and cost the earth.\n\n\"Why can\u2019t we get the best fish in the world and create the best batter, deep fry it and serve it with amazing potatoes?\"\n\nThe chef added that if he had opted to put pan-roasted turbot with pomme puree and a sauce gribiche on the menu for \u00a332.50 instead of fish and chips, \u201cno-one would question anything\u201d.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAs well as discussing fish and chips, the chef also shared some of his top cooking tips - including a trick to make your spaghetti bolognese taste incredible.\n\nThe secret, he says, is to roast the mince instead of frying it.\n\nHe advised people to put the mince in a roasting tray and pop it in the oven for about an hour, stirring occasionally.\n\n\"Texturally, it is amazing. It goes really dry and crunchy and you put it in the stock and tomatoes it rehydrates but it still has this lovely texture. The flavour is massive,\" he added.", "description": "Tom Kerridge explained to Cheltenham Literature Festival why his restaurant charged so much for fish and chips", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Bbc Bone Soup Productions Ltd Richard Hill"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18958196.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Tom-Kerridges-Fresh-Start.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
