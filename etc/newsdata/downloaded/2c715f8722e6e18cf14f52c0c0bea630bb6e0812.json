I don't think that's a good thing for commerce and I really don't think it's a good thing for society.'\n\nKing goes as far as saying some firms have now adopted 'Victorian-era' working practices by using \u2013 and exploiting \u2013 casual labour.\n\nWarehouses run by online shops Amazon and Asos have been criticised by campaigners who have also targeted those run by traditional retailers such as JD Sports and Sports Direct.\n\nIn one recent rebuke, dismissed by Amazon as 'misinformation', the online giant was accused of failing to allow workers sufficient time to go to the toilet or for pregnant women to take breaks.\n\nAt the extreme, some firms now force people to work for themselves \u2013 rather than on contracts \u2013 with few fringe benefits and no safety net at all. Uber, the taxi firm, and Deliveroo, the deliveries giant, have both drawn fire. It is something King also finds particularly galling.\n\nDeliveroo and Uber are examples of firms shifting what would normally be seen as company obligations on to their workers\n\nKing immediately sees similarities with the way dockers were paid 'piecework' in the 19th Century. He calls to mind a pertinent example from his time at Guy Hands' private equity firm Terra Firma, where he was vice-chairman.\n\n'In my old office at Terra Firma there is a black and white photograph taken near the docks in London Bridge where the dockers used to wait queuing round the block for work,' he says.\n\nJustin King, 58, exec with top contacts King took a close interest in son Jordan's, pictured, motor racing career which took off a decade ago Lives: Warwickshire and raised in Dorridge, near Solihull. Career: Mars, PepsiCo and H\u00e4agen-Dazs before joining Asda in 1994. After a stint at M&S as its food director from 2001, he joined Sainsbury's as chief executive in 2004. He has an enviable contacts book having worked with former Boots chief executive Richard Baker at Mars; and Allan Leighton, himself a supreme networker, among many others. He was awarded a CBE in 2011. Hobbies: King took a close interest in son Jordan's motor racing career which took off a decade ago. This year, Jordan qualified for the Indianapolis 500 with Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing.\n\n'They were only getting day work, they didn't get it if they weren't able bodied; I suspect they didn't get it if their skin colour wasn't right; I suspect if they were a member of a union or a trouble maker they didn't get any work. All of those things.'\n\nHe said 'in that exact same spot' he has seen Deliveroo drivers waiting to be called by the online delivery firm to carry food from restaurants to the homes of Londoners on contracts that many might consider to be indistinguishable.\n\n'That doesn't feel like progress to me,' he adds.\n\nAnd it isn't just the approach to employment contracts, he explains. Uber and Deliveroo are also examples of firms shifting what would normally be seen as company obligations on to their workers: both, for instance, ask drivers to use their own vehicles for their work.\n\nAt the top: King ran Marks & Spencer's food business before he left for the top job at Sainsbury's\n\n'Do Deliveroo feel they have any ownership or responsibility of the road worthiness of the vehicles that their drivers and riders use?' King asks. 'Or the extent to which their riders and drivers abide by the law?'\n\nDeliveroo told us it provides 'flexible, well-paid work to 25,000 self-employed riders in the UK' and was the 'first company in the on-demand economy to offer riders free global accident insurance'.\n\nBut King is not impressed. He draws on his experience to formulate an answer to an increasingly complex and out-of-control problem.\n\nHe ran Marks & Spencer's food business before he left for the top job at Sainsbury's and also held senior roles at Asda. 'I think that the legislation, the core of this, is recognising that people are really your employees,' he says. 'And through doing that, recognising all of your responsibilities for them.'\n\nHowever, he draws a clear distinction between necessary 'zero hours' contracts \u2013 used by companies which genuinely only need people at certain times of the week or even seasonally \u2013 and the exploitation he is railing against.\n\n'We had a rule in Sainsbury's that we never contracted any [of our part-time workers] on less than 16 hours a week.\n\n'Usually they worked 16 hours a week because that works for them and if you need an extra ten hours from someone who works 16 hours they will usually find it for you.\n\n'If you need that flexibility from someone already doing 40 hours they probably won't, and probably shouldn't, accommodate you.'\n\nSupermarket power: King used to be the boss of supermarket giant Sainsbury's\n\nHe highlights the contrast to what he sees elsewhere: 'Compare that to sending a white van driver 100 drops \u2013 which means, at a minimum, he's going to drive 150 miles in a vehicle he's hired from a place that you've dictated he's hired from, to a schedule that you've sent him. To argue that he doesn't work for you and that he's in control of his own work \u2013 it's nonsense.'\n\nKing says legislation \u2013 often set with the best intentions \u2013 has only served to drive the wedge.\n\nThe minimum wage, property taxes and Apprenticeship Levy and insolvency rules that allow badly run firms to renegotiate leases en masse force healthy firms to take 'retrograde steps' such as cutting bonuses or scrapping paid breaks, he says.\n\n'I feel many good businesses, better business that employ people well, are doing bad things, not because they think they should because its something they have had to do \u2013 they've got no choice.\n\n'It makes good employers row in the wrong direction because the field of play is being tilted in favour of bad employers. And eventually good employers have to play the same game. That's why it makes me angry. Because vibrant and profitable commerce, creating and maintaining great jobs, paying its taxes and paying the country's bills has never been more important.'", "description": "Justin King has worked for some of the country's biggest corporations at the highest level.
