(AP) - Emmanuel Sanders, one of eight players on Denver\u2019s roster who remember what winning a Super Bowl felt like, declared after the team\u2019s latest loss that the Broncos are \u201cliving in a world of suck.\u201d\n\nNo wins.\n\nNo sacks.\n\nNo breaks.\n\nNo takeaways.\n\nNo deep throws.\n\nNo easy answers.\n\nBut no panicking, either.\n\n\u201cHe was just repeating what I had said in the locker room after the game,\u201d Fangio said Monday. \u201cI told them, \u2018We\u2019re going to have to deal with everybody thinking we suck.\u2019 And (it\u2019s) all of us, not just players coaches, everybody, the whole organization.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos won\u2019t deal with that by taking chances or by making changes, said Fangio, the first head coach in the franchise\u2019s 60-year history to start 0-3.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to stick through it and get through the hard times,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nHe said the \u201ceasiest thing to do is just make wholesale changes, whether its personnel, scheme, this, that and the other thing. There\u2019s the old saying, \u2018Keep doing the same thing and expect different results, that\u2019s not smart.\u2019 But there\u2019s also a saying, \u2018Change for just change\u2019s sake isn\u2019t very smart, either,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nHe acknowledged that staying the course is a harder sell without the reinforcement of results.\n\n\u201cI think you just show them the video evidence of why you feel that way,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s certain of is the Broncos, who host Jacksonville next weekend, have the talent to turn it around quickly.\n\n\u201cWe just have to play a little bit better,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cAnd along with that, we have to coach better.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nSecond-year WR Courtland Sutton, whose 52-yard catch was the gemstone of his five-catch, 87-yard day, also had a key downfield block that helped RB Phillip Lindsay cap a 36-yard catch-and-run that set up a TD.\n\nDespite Denver\u2019s defense not getting any inside push to collapse the pocket, OLB Bradley Chubb had three tackles for loss and the lone hit on Aaron Rodgers in the Broncos\u2019 27-16 loss at Green Bay.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe pairing of Fangio and Miller was expected to make history, but not this kind: Since 1982, when sacks became an official statistic, the Broncos are the only team to go this deep into a season without a sack or a takeaway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to find a way to play better,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI have to find a way to get sacks and do my job.\u201d\n\nAlthough Miller dropped into coverage about a half-dozen times, including the game\u2019s first snap, Fangio tried to dispel growing speculation that his scheme and his superstar linebacker just aren\u2019t a good fit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct because he\u2019s playing basically the same way he\u2019s played his whole career,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nNot helping matters is Denver\u2019s plodding offense with QB Joe Flacco (six sacks, two turnovers on Sunday) holding onto the ball far too long. The Broncos never led Sunday and they\u2019ve have only had the lead for 12 of 180 minutes so far.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nLT Garett Bolles didn\u2019t get flagged after collecting four penalties the week before, but the real hero of the O-line was rookie LG Dalton Risner, who put his pig-wrestling skills he honed while growing up on a Colorado farm to good use on fourth-and-goal when he grabbed Lindsay and spun him into the end zone .\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nSanders had just two catches for 10 yards a week after posting 11 receptions for 98 yards against Chicago. Fangio said Sanders\u2019 holding penalty that negated Royce Freeman\u2019s touchdown wasn\u2019t ticky-tack.\n\n\u201cNo, he held him,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nINJURED\n\nDE Derek Wolfe (high ankle sprain) and LB Josey Jewell (hamstring) went for MRIs Monday. Fangio said FB Andy Janovich (pectoral) is getting closer to returning but wasn\u2019t as optimistic about CB Bryce Callahan (foot).\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n8.\n\nThat\u2019s how many sacks NFL leader Shaquil Barrett has for the Buccaneers after bolting the Broncos for a one-year, $4 million deal last spring, by far the biggest bargain in free agency.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nBaby steps, starting with the Jaguars (1-2) and rookie QB sensation Gardner Minshew , who will try to extend Denver\u2019s losing streak to eight games, which would tie for the third longest in team history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to figure out a way to go out and play our best, cleanest game this week,\u201d Fangio said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders, one of eight players on Denver's roster who remember what winning a Super Bowl felt like, declared after the team's latest loss that the Broncos are \"living in a world of suck.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/broncos_packers_football_98497_c0-180-4292-2682_s1770x1032.jpg?34e9bbe2533d9b63e37e17ab4759cad018b0ea44", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
