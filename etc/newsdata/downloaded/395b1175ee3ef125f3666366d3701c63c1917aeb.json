The President\u2019s decision to reverse sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America\u2019s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike that our word cannot be trusted,\u201d the lawmakers said.\n\nRead the rest of their statement:\n\n\"President Erdogan has given up nothing, and President Trump has given him everything. The Turks have stated that \u2018this is not a ceasefire,\u2019 and made clear that they \u2018will pause the operation for 120 hours in order for the terrorists to leave\u2019 \u2014 referring to the courageous Kurdish fighters who have suffered nearly 11,000 casualties in our fight to defeat ISIS. This agreement also does nothing to stop thousands of ISIS prisoners from escaping, and shows the President\u2019s complete lack of strategy to defeat ISIS. To say that Turkey and Syria will guard the prisoners is outrageous and puts our homeland security at risk. ISIS is still a threat, certainly now more than before President Trump gave Erdogan the green light to invade Syria.\n\nPresident Trump unleashed a further escalation of chaos and insecurity in Syria that has left dozens of innocent civilians dead, displaced hundreds of thousands more and invited the resurgence of ISIS. The only beneficiaries of the President\u2019s policies are our adversaries: ISIS, Bashar al-Assad, Vladimir Putin and Iran. Today\u2019s decision further makes the argument that President Trump doesn\u2019t see Putin as the danger he is to our country.\n\nYesterday\u2019s overwhelming bipartisan 354-60 vote in the House to oppose the President\u2019s decision and demand a clear ISIS strategy yesterday was an important step, and the Senate should do the same immediately. Next week, the House will pass a strong, bipartisan sanctions package to work to reverse the humanitarian disaster that President Trump unleashed in Syria. Our service members, our allies and our partners all suffering from the Syrian conflict deserve smart, strong and sane leadership from Washington.\u201d", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US Vice President Mike Pence reached a deal to suspend Turkish offensive in Northern Syria.
