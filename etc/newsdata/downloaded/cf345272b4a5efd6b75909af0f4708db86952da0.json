The report said negotiations on touchier issues such as forced transfers of technologies could come later. The New York Times (link) also reported that the U.S. would soon issue licenses to some U.S. companies to do business again with China's Huawei Technologies, a move that could significantly ease tensions.\n\nJapan's Nikkei rose 0.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 0.2%. The Shanghai Composite advanced 0.2% and the Shenzhen Composite jumped 0.5%. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.8%, while benchmark indexes in Singapore and Indonesia were mixed. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was about flat. Taiwan's Taiex was closed for a holiday.\n\nAmong individual stocks, convenience-store chain FamilyMart (8028.TO) rose in Tokyo trading, along with SoftBank (9984.TO) and Advantest (6857.TO) . In Hong Kong, AAC Technologies (2018.HK) and Sunny Optical (2382.HK) gained, while New World Development (0017.HK) retreated.
