REUTERS/Jason Reed\n\n(Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)(RIO.L) said on Wednesday its third-quarter iron ore shipments rose 5%, helped by higher demand from Chinese steelmakers.\n\nThe global miner shipped 86.1 million tonnes of iron ore in the July-September quarter, compared with 81.9 million tonnes a year earlier.\n\nRio maintained its iron ore shipment forecast for the year of between 320 million and 330 million tonnes. Iron ore typically accounts for more than 60% of Rio\u2019s earnings.\n\nGlobal iron ore production has largely stabilized in recent months after a fatal dam collapse in Brazil squeezed supplies. Prices have also come off their highs touched earlier this year following the incident.\n\nRio cut its bauxite and alumina production forecast for the year, citing poor weather and facility maintenance.", "description": "Global miner Rio Tinto said on Wednesday its third-quarter iron ore shipments rose 5%, helped by higher demand from Chinese steelmakers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441253296&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1YC", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
