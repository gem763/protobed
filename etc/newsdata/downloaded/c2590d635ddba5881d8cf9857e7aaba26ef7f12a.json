And five children, six grandchildren, and three great grandchildren into his life, he is concerned that climate change will impact their futures \"without exception.\" That's partly why he is consumed by what can be done about it on both a personal and professional level.\n\n\"It's a big worry, but it's also a very, very big investment opportunity,\" Fuss told Business Insider during a recent interview. He added, \"to be honest with you, I'm obsessed with it.\"\n\nRead more: Dan Fuss is revered as 'the Warren Buffett of bonds.' He walked us through the investing approach that's delivered market-beating returns and turbocharged his 61-year career.\n\nFuss could be occupied with many other things besides the climate. He actually is, judging from his flagship fund's market-beating performance since 1996 \u2014 a 7% annual rate of return versus 5% for his Bloomberg-Barclays benchmark.\n\nHowever, there is no shortage of warnings about the future that compel him to think about climate change, on top of his responsibilities as a fund manager.\n\nTwo recent reports illustrate what he's worried about and why he sees an investing opportunity.\n\nIn September, a sweeping report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that a three-foot rise sea levels could displace hundreds of millions of people in coastal areas by the end of the century.\n\nAdditionally, a note from Goldman Sachs' Global Market Institute stated that half of the world's population will reside in \"water-stressed areas\" as soon as 2025. It added that cities from New York to Shanghai are at risk of flooding, fires, storms, and other destructive weather events.\n\nIn terms of interim solutions \u2014 and opportunities for investors \u2014 Fuss declined to discuss specific company recommendations. But he highlighted a few ways investors can defensively reduce the pollution in their portfolios.\n\nOne commodity that can fuel a cleaner planet and give investors an inroad stands out to him: natural gas.\n\nWhile it's not as clean as a technology as solar energy, it's a greener substitute for coal and other fuels that have dominated industry for centuries. Fuss also raised the possibility that more cars will be powered by natural gas in the future.\n\nThere's also the opportunity to invest in oil companies that also produce natural gas, while avoiding those that continue to lean heavily on high-carbon-energy fuels, Fuss said.\n\nThe largest energy company in his Loomis Sayles Bond Fund portfolio is Chesapeake Energy. It is a $2.5 billion producer of oil and natural gas, and was Fuss' fourth-largest holding as of Aug. 31.\n\nAdditionally, the United States Natural Gas Fund is an exchange-traded security that tracks the percentage movements of natural gas prices.\n\nRead more: The world's most accurate economic forecaster sees a 'prolonged global slowdown' on the horizon \u2014 and warns it can only be narrowly avoided", "description": "Fuss singled out a commodity that can help investors profit from multiple efforts to dampen the impact of climate change.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e44ac122bd519db60e9c7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
