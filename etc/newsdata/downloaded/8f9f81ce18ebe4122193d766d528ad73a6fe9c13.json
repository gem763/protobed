The room is relatively full but people are quietly sitting as they watch the results come in.

Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nAhead of the poll, Liberals and Conservatives were going neck-and-neck, and while it was unclear who would emerge at the steering wheel in the end, a minority government seemed to be the most likely outcome.\n\nIn the months leading up to the vote, the election started to be seen not as an assessment of the Liberals per se, but as a judgment day for Trudeau, a former poster boy for progressivism , whose reputation has been severely tarnished by the ongoing SNC Lavalin corruption scandal, his decision to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion despite environmentalists\u2019 concerns and, most recently, a blackface and \u2018brownface\u2019 debacle.\n\nAlso on rt.com Referendum on Trudeau: Liberals and Conservatives neck and neck as voters go to the polls in Canadian election\n\nWhile fellow Liberals have been dissatisfied with Trudeau talking the talk but not walking the walk, his government is credited with legalization of cannabis and its social policies, which reduced the age to receive Old Age Security from 67 to 65 , among other things.\n\nLike this story?
