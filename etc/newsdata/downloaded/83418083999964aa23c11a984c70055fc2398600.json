We're coming back!'\n\n'Today, Alberto is the president of all Argentines,' said Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who governed Argentina from 2007 to 2015. 'He will have a very hard task ahead of us that will require the cooperation of all Argentines.'\n\nShe blew kisses at the crowd and thanked supporters who brandished tattoos with her image and the image of her late husband and predecessor as president, Nestor Kirchner, who died nine years ago Sunday.\n\nA supporter takes a selfie with former Argentinian President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who ran successfully as vice president with center-left Peronist candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in Sunday's election victory over the incumbent, Mauricio Macri\n\nPeronist and Argentina's President-elect Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, waves after voting in Buenos Aires on Sunday\n\nAlberto Fern\u00e1ndez thanked all Argentines, paid homage to the late Kirchner and said he would need the support of Macri's administration to reconstruct what he called the inherited 'ashes' of Argentina,\n\n'The only thing that concerns us is that Argentines stop suffering once and for all,' he told the crowd. 'We're back and we're going to be better!'\n\nEarlier in the evening, Macri told disappointed supporters at his headquarters that he had called Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez to congratulate him and invited him for a breakfast chat Monday at the Pink Presidential Palace.\n\nPresident Mauricio Macri, who was running for reelection, throws a kiss to supporters after conceding the election next to his wife Juliana Awada waves in Buenos Aires on Sunday\n\n'We need an orderly transition that will bring tranquility to all Argentines, because the most important thing is the well-being of all Argentines,' Macri said.\n\nAuthorities said Fern\u00e1ndez has 48% of the votes compared to 40.47 per cent for Macri, with 95.54 per cent of the votes counted. He needs 45 per cent support, or 40 per cent support with a 10 percentage point lead, over the nearest rival to avoid a runoff vote on Nov. 24.\n\nThe results still needs to be confirmed.\n\nA car carrying Peronist and Argentina's President-Elect Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez leaves a polling station after he voted in Buenos Aires on Sunday\n\nMacri was elected president in 2015 promising to jumpstart the country's economy. Argentines rejected at the time a successor chosen by Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who along with her late husband dominated Argentina's political scene for 12 years and rewrote its social contract. But the divisive former leader, who embodies Argentina's enduring cycle of hope and despair, is back.\n\n'I'm so happy. We were waiting for this change for a long time. We're tired of everything that has been happening', said supporter Juan Jose De Antonio, 46. 'Some of us live a different reality from those suffering hunger, but when you have a friend who lost a job, a neighbor who can't make ends meet, it hits you'.\n\nSunday's largely peaceful election was dominated by concerns over rising poverty, a sharp depreciation of the currency and one of the world's highest inflation rates. Voters appeared to have rejected austerity measures that Macri insisted were needed to revive Argentina's struggling economy. Many\n\nVoters line up in Buenos Aires on Sunday. Argentina could take a political turn with center-left Peronist President-Elect Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in power, taking over for incumbent Mauricio Macri amid growing frustration over the country's economic crisis\n\nA man with the Spanish message 'We win! All united' joins supporters of center-left Peronist and President-Elect Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and running mate, former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, outside their party's election headquarters in Buenos Aires to wait for results\n\nArgentines have taken to the streets frustrated with cuts subsidies that have led to rises in utilities and transportation costs.\n\nThe result also marks a shift leftward for South America, which has seen conservative governments elected in Brazil, Colombia and Chile in recent years. She was considered part of the 'pink tide' of leftist governments that arose in the region in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nNow a left-leaning government appears set to govern Argentina, and governments in Chile, Peru and Ecuador fueled by discontent over corruption, inequality and slowing growth.\n\n'We Argentines deserve a better country, with work, where we can live peacefully, above all', said Antonella Bruna, 32, as she voted at the medical school of the National University of Rosario, about 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Buenos Aires.\n\nSupporters of center-left Peronist and President-Elect Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and running mate, former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, outside their party's election headquarters to wait for results in Buenos Aires\n\nMacri retained wide support among the key farming sector in one of the world's top suppliers of grains. But overall frustration over the economy eroded the popularity of the pro-business former mayor of Buenos Aires. It also propelled the candidacy of Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, whose surge has sent jitters in the financial markets over a possible return to interventionist polices of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez's 2007-2015 administration.\n\nMacri's camp tried, but failed to capitalize on that unease, portraying her as a puppet master waiting in the wings. The presidential candidate has dismissed those fears and voters gave him a decisive victory over Macri in August primaries, which are a barometer of support for candidates ahead of the presidential election.\n\nAlberto Fern\u00e1ndez served as chief of staff from 2003 to 2007 for Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez's predecessor and late husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner. He remained in the position during part of her term as president but left after a conflict with farmers in 2008.\n\nPeronism is a broad but splintered political movement in the South American country of 44 million people.\n\nOn the election trail, Fern\u00e1ndez criticized Macri's decision to seek a record $56 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, a deeply unpopular institution in Argentina that is blamed for creating the conditions that led to the country's worst economic meltdown in 2001.\n\nMacri is credited with returning Argentina to international global markets following a break after the 2001 crisis and with helping strike a free trade deal between South America's Mercosur bloc and the European Union amid global trade tensions and rising protectionism. But he failed to deliver on promises to jumpstart the economy of the recession-hit country, while Argentines continue to lose purchasing power to an inflation rate of more than 55 percent and about a third have been plunged under the poverty line.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Macri pleaded for more time to reverse fortunes and reminds voters of the corruption cases facing Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who has denied any wrongdoing and remains a powerful if divisive figure in Argentina.\n\n'It's important so we don't go back to the time of the Kirchners, when there was so much robbery, so much embezzlement. That wouldn't be good for the country,' said Bernarda Nidia Guichandut, who helped her elderly parents into a car to go to vote.\n\n'Macri is honest. He's made mistakes, he's backtracked, but he's said: 'Fine, I was wrong.''\n\nArgentines also chose 130 lower house seats and 24 senators in Congress, as well as regional mayors, governors for three provinces and the head of government for the Argentine capital.", "description": "Argentina's conservative President Mauricio Macri has lost his re-election bid to the more left-leaning Peronist candidate\u00a0Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and his running mate, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who also was president.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
