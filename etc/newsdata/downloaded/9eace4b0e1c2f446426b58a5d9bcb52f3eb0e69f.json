The Sportsnet analyst and former NHL hockey player was supposed to hit the ice as a skater \u2014 until he tore his hamstring during training.\n\n\"I was supposed to be a figure skater destined for the big stage, but my career was hamstrung.\" Don't worry Colby, now you're a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BOTB?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BOTB</a> judge! Catch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/armdog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@armdog</a> as a judge with our head judge <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KurtBrowning?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@kurtbrowning</a> all season long. Thursdays at 8 p.m. (9AT/9:30NT) on CBC. <a href=\"https://t.co/PbLkp2PbN9\">pic.twitter.com/PbLkp2PbN9</a> \u2014@CBCbattle\n\nNow he sits opposite of head judge Kurt Browning every week on Battle of the Blades. From his first week in the judge's chair, the audience got a taste of Armstrong's distinctive, enthusiastic prairie boy expressions and lighthearted hockey-jock commentary. And they were smitten.\n\nLearn some of his vocabulary or, as we like to call them, \"Colby-isms.\" Are you ready to speak like Colby Armstrong, bud?\n\nBuddy\n\nSit down with a cup of hot cocoa and take a sip every time Armstrong says \"bud\" or \"buddy\" while he delivers hot takes from the judge's seat. Try not to burn your tastebuds!\n\nOn a scale of one to buddy, how Colby Armstrong are you feeling today? 1:07\n\n\"I'm Canada's judge.\"\n\nWhile appearing on Sportsnet's Hockey Central Tonight, Armstrong didn't skip a beat when he called himself \"Canada's judge.\"\n\n\"I have no clue what I'm doing, but I'm having a blast,\" he says in the video below.\n\nEven though Armstrong claims to not know what he's doing, he has a bit of a background in figure skating. His mother Rosemary Armstrong is a figure skating coach in Saskatoon. Skating like a pro runs through his blood, bud.\n\n\"Planet Sheldon\"\n\nDuring week four, Sheldon Kennedy and Kaitlyn Weaver skated to Nat King Cole's tune Smile from the movie Modern Times in a cinematic performance. Using props, expression and even some slick camera tricks, the performance took Armstrong out of this world.\n\n\"I love 'Planet Sheldon,'\" swooned Armstrong after the performance. \"You take us there every week. We are so lucky to see it.\"\n\nKaitlyn Weaver and Sheldon Kennedy perform to Smile from the Modern Times soundtrack on Week 4 2:07\n\n\"Get out of town on a bike!\"\n\nArmstrong came out of left field with this one. In this behind-the-scenes video, he rattles off this catchphrase before introducing guest judge Sarah Nurse in week four.\n\nNeed more? Stream the entire episode to hear more judge's commentary from Nurse and Armstrong.\n\n\"You went full P.J.\"\n\nArmstrong was supposed to be Violetta Afanasieva's original skating partner this season. But after the hamstring injury knocked him out of the competition, P.J. Stock returned to Battle of the Blades to take Armstrong's place as her skating partner.\n\nDuring week four, Stock danced his heart out on the ice to Do You Love Me from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack with Afansieva. The performance floored Armstrong.\n\nVioletta Afanasieva and P.J. Stock perform to Do You Love Me from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack on Week 4 2:02\n\n\"I wish I played hockey on your team,\" said Armstrong from the judge's dais. \"We saw everything of it out here \u2026 the kind of guy you are: the great guy in the room, the fun, goofy guy, the tough guy we saw with the strong lifts \u2026 Buddy, you went full P.J.\"", "description": "Armstrong's enthusiastic prairie boy expressions and light-hearted jock commentary are an audience favourite.
