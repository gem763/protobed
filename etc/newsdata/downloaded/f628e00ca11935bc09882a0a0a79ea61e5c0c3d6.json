You can see the scope and depth of our journalism in the work we published just this morning: from Jemele Hill making the case for why black athletes should leave white colleges; to James Fallows on how America can find hope in the fall of Rome; to Amanda Mull on the surprising comeback of the hair scrunchie.\n\nThanks to the quality of our team\u2019s work, The Atlantic has never been bigger than it is right now. More than 30 million people each month visit our website, read our print magazine, watch our documentaries, listen to our podcasts, and attend our live events. But our ambitions are still growing. Our aim is nothing less than to be a standard-bearer for truth in an age of disinformation.\n\nFrom the very first issue\u2014cover price 25 cents\u2014our magazine has relied on readers who recognize the value of ideas; who believe that rigorous reporting, critical thinking, independent analysis, and beautiful writing are things worth cherishing.\n\nTo ensure that The Atlantic has a bright future, we are today introducing a new digital-subscription service. The Atlantic turns 162 in November. My dream is that the steps we take in this period\u2014a difficult one for our industry, as you no doubt know\u2014will guarantee that our magazine will celebrate its bicentennial as a flourishing and indispensable creator of the world\u2019s best journalism.\n\nBeginning today, you will be able to read five articles each month on our website without cost.
