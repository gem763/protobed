John along with Arshad Warsi and Pulkit Samrat are seen to pack in some punchy dialogues in the trailer, which begins with a disclaimer 'Dimag Mat Lagana Kyuki Inmein Hai Nahin'.\n\nJohn Abraham shared the trailer on his Instagram. In it, the trio is seen getting into trouble repeatedly and presumably because John is under the effect of inauspicious planetary arrangement - 'Sadhe Sati'.\n\nA quip by Arshad Warsi saying, \"Pandey ji, humlog sense mein aate hain, nonsense me nahi\" is shown in the trailer.\n\nIleana D'Cruz, Kriti Kharbanda, and Urvashi Rautela, play the other lead roles in the film. A mix of perfect situational comedy and dialogue delivery, the trailer also remixes the 90s hit number 'Tum Par Hum Hain Atke' from the Salman Khan and Kajol starrer 'Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya'.\n\nDon't Miss 39.9 K SHARES 7.7 K SHARES 6 K SHARES 4.3 K SHARES 5.7 K SHARES\n\nSome of the dialogues from the trailer have inspired hilarious memes!\n\n#PagalpantiTrailer\n\nNo one\n\nLiterally no one\n\nPopular mobile brand for\n\ntheir battery:- pic.twitter.com/5Ewd1lrAZM \u2014 Dilip Rangwani (@ItsRDil) October 22, 2019\n\n#PagalpantiTrailer\n\n*Me correctly answers few initial questions while watching Kaun Baneha Crorepati*\n\nMy parents - pic.twitter.com/DdnKoztB2L \u2014 Dang!
