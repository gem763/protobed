The annual percentage yield on cash at TD now ranges from 0.01%-0.04%.\n\nIn a note published Thursday, Credit Suisse analyst Craig Siegenthaler said that with the yield reductions, TD is \u201crunning out of room\u201d to offset the next Fed rate cuts.\n\nA spokesperson for TD said that the firm\u2019s sweep accounts are \u201cdesigned to meet transactional cash needs. For clients seeking higher yields, or holding cash as an investment class, we offer access to non-proprietary, no-transaction-fee money market funds with market-competitive yields.\u201d\n\nSweep accounts are designed to hold customer cash for liquidity purposes. Cash automatically \u201csweeps\u201d between uses such as settling trades or making funds available for check-writing. Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group offer higher-yielding money-market funds for daily liquidity. But most brokerages no longer do so, requiring customers to place a buy order for a money-market fund if they want cash available the next business day.\n\nYields are coming down in response to the Fed\u2019s two quarter-point rate cuts in August and September. The Fed reduced its benchmark federal-funds rate to a range of 1.75%-2%. The cuts are now rippling through sweep accounts and money-market funds as brokers and fund sponsors earn less income on invested cash, passing on lower yields to customers.\n\nBrokerage sweep accounts now yield an average of 0.23%, according to Crane Data, down by 0.02 percentage point in the past month. Retail money-market funds yield an average 1.65%, down by 0.17 point in the past month.\n\nAs Barron\u2019s has reported, brokerages count on investors keeping cash in sweep accounts for convenience, giving up some yield in return for liquidity. Brokerages make a bundle on that cash by shifting it to their balance sheet and investing it in Treasuries and other high-quality securities.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nBut investors should avoid holding much cash in a sweep account if possible. Yes, it\u2019s necessary for liquidity. But if you\u2019re holding cash as a portfolio asset, it\u2019s better to use a money-market fund or bank savings account, which almost always yield more than a brokerage sweep account.\n\nOnline savings accounts yield an average 1.39%, according to Crane Data. Banks such as Barclays and Goldman Sachs \u2019 Marcus division yield 2% for online savings with no minimum deposits.\n\nA yield of 2% might not sound like much. But it\u2019s better than almost nothing in a sweep account\u2014and it certainly beats the negative yields on European and other foreign bonds. According to Bloomberg, some $17 trillion in global debt, or 30% of all investment-grade securities, now yields less than zero. As Bloomberg notes, \u201cinvestors who acquire the debt and hold it to maturity are guaranteed to make a loss.\u201d\n\nIn that context, TD\u2019s 0.04% yield on cash doesn\u2019t look that bad.\n\nWrite to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com", "description": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s latest rate cuts are taking yields back down to nearly zero percent at online brokers.
