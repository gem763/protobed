He died in in prison in 1982.\n\nA series of cases have raised further concerns about his honesty, and last year the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction of a businessman, Stephen Simmons, after hearing Ridgewell had \"fitted him up\".\n\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) said it had now decided to refer the cases of Mr Trew and Mr Christie to the Court of Appeal, although it had failed to trace the other two members of the Oval Four.\n\nImage copyright Winston Trew Image caption Winston Trew forged a career as a university lecturer\n\n\"The referral is made because the Commission considers there is a real possibility that the court will quash the conviction on the basis of new evidence and arguments concerning the integrity of DS Ridgewell,\" it said, adding that the case may have \"potential significance\" for a number of other similar convictions.\n\nMr Trew, now 69, said he was \"absolutely delighted\" there was to be a fresh appeal, saying his life had been \"shattered\" when he was jailed 47 years ago.\n\n\"My wife left me, I lost my confidence, I was a shell of the person I was before,\" he said.\n\nMr Trew, who remarried and forged a career as a university lecturer and author, said he thought about what happened every day and had \"never given up\" trying to overturn his conviction.\n\n\"The police did something wrong, so I'm going to fight the injustice.\"\n\nThe appeal is expected to be heard next year.", "description": "Two men claim they were wrongly convicted of assaulting a police officer nearly 50 years ago.", "authors": ["Danny Shaw", "Home Affairs Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A852/production/_109209034_20191012_113220.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
