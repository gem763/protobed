When Little Mix were crowned, the first Facebook message she saw was from a stranger. It read: \u201cYou are the ugliest thing I have ever seen in my life. You do not deserve to be in this girl band, you deserve to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should have been on cloud nine,\u201d she says. \u201cI had Leigh-Anne [Pinnock, also of Little Mix] in my room being like: \u2018This is the best!\u2019 and I was like: \u2018No, this isn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d\n\nLittle Mix went on to become the biggest British girl group since the Spice Girls, but Nelson was consumed by the trolling and abuse on social media. Within two years of the finale, she had depression and an eating disorder and had attempted suicide.\n\nThe downward spiral and her eventual, slow recovery are the focus of an intensely personal BBC One documentary, Jesy Nelson: Odd One Out. Before shooting it, she says, she had never spoken publicly about her struggles in the spotlight.\n\nWhen we meet in a corner of BBC Broadcasting House in central London, Nelson, now 28, is friendly and glamorous, dressed in a double-breasted tangerine suit. It is the eighth anniversary of her X Factor debut and #8YearsofLittleMix has been trending on Twitter all morning, thanks to their fans, the \u201cMixers\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest On The X Factor in 2011: (from left) Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson.

In fact, that eighth series was the first where applicants could upload their audition videos to YouTube; Nelson didn\u2019t even know what YouTube was. She remembers being wowed when all the contestants were given new Samsung phones and told to get on Twitter to build their fanbase.\n\nOn the first live show 12 weeks in, Little Mix (then Rhythmix \u2013 the name was changed later) performed Nicki Minaj\u2019s Super Bass to gushing praise from judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and their mentor Tulisa Contostavlos. It was \u201cthe best feeling in the world,\u201d said Nelson through happy tears on stage.\n\nThat night, off-camera, the contestants gathered to watch themselves on YouTube. Someone pointed out the comment section. \u201cI was very naive,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cI thought it would be people giving their opinion on our performance. But nearly every comment was about the way I looked: \u2018She\u2019s a fat ugly rat\u2019; \u2018How has she got in this girl group?\u2019; \u2018How is the fat one in this?\u2019\u201d She remembers the air being thick with tension \u2013 \u201cbecause no one knew what to do or how to react.\n\n\u201cI felt a rush of anxiety, because I\u2019d never experienced anything like that in my life. People were saying my face was deformed \u2013 just the most horrific things. I felt like I was heartbroken. I remember ringing my mum and saying: \u2018Mum, I want to go home, I don\u2019t want to do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jesy Nelson with Liz Richie in the forthcoming BBC documentary Odd One Out. Photograph: Rahul Bhatt/BBC/October Films\n\nAt about 1am, a member of The X Factor team found Nelson crying alone and asked why she was so upset. A couple of days later, she was asked to explain again \u2013 on camera. She didn\u2019t want to do it. \u201cThey told me it wasn\u2019t recorded, and it was.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, the clip of Nelson in tears over \u201ca few nasty comments\u201d was broadcast before Little Mix\u2019s performance, the reality TV playbook of \u201csad piano\u201d switching to upbeat pop music when Thirlwall comforts her: an uplifting moment of girl power. From then on, that was Nelson\u2019s public narrative.\n\nShe does not hold that clip, or the producers, responsible: \u201cI think it would have always happened \u2013 that just added fuel to the fire.\u201d From the start, relatability had been billed as a central tenet of Little Mix\u2019s appeal. Contostavlos introduced them as \u201cthe girl group to represent ladies in this country\u201d; she framed Nelson\u2019s tears as evidence of Little Mix having \u201cthe same insecurities as every other girl\u201d.\n\nNelson, however, was the only member even remotely close to the average UK woman at size 16. Although the four bandmates have always been friends \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s why we\u2019re still together\u201d \u2013 she felt singled out. \u201cI was with three other girls to be compared to. I don\u2019t think it would have been as bad if I\u2019d been on my own.\u201d\n\nAfter the clip presented her as Little Mix\u2019s weakest link, the abuse snowballed. \u201cIt was like as soon as people knew that it was really affecting me, they wanted to do it more.\u201d Nelson had been bullied at school, to the point of stress-induced alopecia \u2013 \u201cbut this wasn\u2019t playground stuff\u201d.\n\nShe was shocked by the cruelty from adults \u2013 some clearly parents. \u201cObviously everyone sits in their living room and will see someone on TV and make a comment. But to actually pick up your phone and go: \u2018I\u2019m going to make sure this girl sees it\u2019 \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t think I was going to see it \u2013 you have no idea the effect that one comment will have.\u201d\n\nNelson became \u201cobsessed\u201d with reading criticism. The praise didn\u2019t register. \u201cIt only got worse when I got Twitter. And that led to the Daily Mail, and reading the [below the line] comments \u2013 the worst you can read about yourself. It was like I purposely wanted to hurt myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a routine of waking up, going on Twitter, searching for the worst things I could about myself. I\u2019d type in the search bar: \u2018Jesy fat\u2019, or \u2018Jesy ugly\u2019, and see what would come up. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even need to do that, I\u2019d just write \u2018Jesy\u2019 and then I\u2019d see all the horrible things. Everyone told me to ignore it \u2013 but it was like an addiction.\u201d\n\nAt one event, Nicola Roberts of Girls Aloud \u2013 who had seen the clip of her crying \u2013 took Nelson aside. \u201cShe said: \u2018Can I just give you one bit of advice? Please don\u2019t read stuff about you. It\u2019s the worst thing you could do.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Little Mix in Sydney, Australia, in 2013: (from left) Perrie Edwards, Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jesy Nelson. Photograph: Newspix/Rex\n\nNelson rolls her eyes self-mockingly. \u201cBut did I listen? No.\u201d\n\nContestants had been told help was available if they were struggling, but Nelson had learned that talking only made the problem worse. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the team really knew how upset it was making me \u2013 it\u2019s just go-go-go, from the car into hair and makeup, then rehearsals.\u201d\n\nIt was also a popularity contest. \u201cWe just wanted to make everyone happy, and we wanted everyone to like us.\u201d\n\nIn December 2011, Little Mix became the first group to win The X Factor. Their debut single entered the charts at No 1 seven months later; DNA, their first album, was released in November 2012. Scrutiny of Nelson only increased amid the pressure to maintain momentum.\n\nAlthough she tried not to discuss it, she feels the abuse came to define her public image. \u201cI\u2019d become a bit of a joke. People would make memes, chopping my head off in a group photo and putting a monster or ET on there. I\u2019d be in live Q&As and these things would pop up and I\u2019d have to just sit there.\u201d\n\nInterviewers asked her how she dealt with it; fans said they looked up to her. She was depressed and in denial: she refused antidepressants, and therapy didn\u2019t help. \u201cOur schedule was so gruelling. I was going to see a therapist at six o\u2019clock in the morning, crying, and then going to a photoshoot.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in public, she was \u201cgiving speeches about being confident\u201d. Little Mix, as the guardians of girl power, were not only supposed to represent every woman, but defend every woman.\n\n\u201cI felt I had to be this person who was like \u2026\u201d Nelson juts her jaw, sashays from side to side, a facsimile of her sassy music-video persona: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t care what people are saying about me, I\u2019m this strong woman.\u2019 That was the role I had to take on in the group, when really I was an absolute mess.\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to TV performances or video shoots: \u201cI\u2019d starve myself \u2026 I\u2019d drink Diet Coke for a solid four days and then, when I felt a bit dizzy, I\u2019d eat a pack of ham because I knew it had no calories. Then I\u2019d binge eat, then hate myself.\u201d\n\nYet she did not see herself as having an eating disorder. \u201cI could see that I was losing weight and sometimes I\u2019d see a few good comments and that spiralled me to be like: \u2018This is how I need to stay.\u2019 No one cares whether your performance was good, or if you sounded great.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nelson in Odd One Out. Photograph: Jamie Simonds/BBC/October Films\n\nNelson started skipping events where she knew she would be photographed. On one magazine shoot, the wrong size clothes were provided. \u201cI had a meltdown. I cried so much, I had to wear sunglasses. I did one photo, then left.\u201d She hid her misery well, she says now. \u201cI think people just thought I was a miserable bitch.\u201d\n\nHer lowest point was in the lead-up to Little Mix\u2019s second album, Salute, in 2013. Her mum, Janice, increasingly desperate, told her she had to quit the band. Yet Nelson worried that leaving \u2013 or even taking a break \u2013 would draw more attention to herself. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to ask why.\u201d\n\nIn November 2013, Little Mix returned to The X Factor to perform their new single, Nelson notably slimmed down. Coverage centred on one tweet from Katie Hopkins: \u201cPacket Mix have still got a chubber in their ranks. Less Little Mix. More Pick n Mix.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, Nelson felt trapped. \u201cI felt that I physically couldn\u2019t tolerate the pain any more.\u201d She attempted suicide.\n\nNelson\u2019s family, her management and the rest of the group knew \u2013 but \u201conce it was spoken about, it wasn\u2019t ever spoken about again,\u201d she says. She was offered time off, but once more was too frightened of drawing attention to herself to take it.\n\nThe turning point came in February 2014, when Little Mix spent six weeks travelling across North America, opening for Demi Lovato. One day, on the bus, the dancers pulled her aside and told her she had to quit Twitter, likening it to a book filled with \u201cloads of nasty things\u201d that Nelson always had her nose in. She finally deleted her account.\n\n\u201cIt was a long, hard process, because I didn\u2019t want to help myself. But it wasn\u2019t until I deleted Twitter that everything changed for me and I slowly started to feel normal again.\u201d Through more regular therapy and talking to friends and family, eventually she was able to stop reading articles about herself, and distance herself from her public image even as Little Mix\u2019s star continued to climb. In 2016, Glory Days became their first No 1 album in the UK.\n\nSince February, Nelson has been dating the 2017 Love Island contestant Chris Hughes, who has defended her publicly from online trolling and who she says is a positive influence on her feelings about fame: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be around someone who doesn\u2019t give a shit about all that stuff.\u201d\n\nMaking the documentary also contributed; she lights up while talking about meeting a body-image specialist, Liz Ritchie, to help her understand her relationship with social media and the \u201cmask\u201d that she had developed to withstand the spotlight. Part of this involved going over footage from The X Factor, which was a difficult experience, but ultimately empowering.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I still have days when I feel shit in myself but instead of beating myself up about it and being miserable, I think: \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to have my moment of being sad, and I\u2019ll be over it.\u2019 Before, I didn\u2019t let myself be sad.\u201d\n\nTalking to other young people who have experienced online abuse made her feel less alone. \u201cA lot of people think \u2018stop moaning\u2019, but until you\u2019ve experienced it, it\u2019s hard to understand \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t just happen to people in the limelight. There\u2019s so many people struggling with social media and online trolling. People need to know about the effects it has.\u201d\n\nThe turnaround in five years, she agrees, is remarkable: now, as Little Mix work on their sixth album, Nelson is less conscious of her weight, her appearance, what she\u2019s eating \u2013 even what is being said about her. To shoot the documentary, she returned to Twitter, and discovered some new slurs. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know some people said that about me, but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t look for it \u2013 and also, I. Don\u2019t. Care,\u201d she says, leaning forward in her chair.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m mentally a lot happier, I just think people are always going to have an opinion. But I only care about mine.\u201d She flashes a smile from beneath all her hair, happy but defiant \u2013 and for a moment she looks exactly like the girl in the music videos.\n\nJesy Nelson: Odd One Out is on BBC One at 9pm on 12 September, and will be available on BBC iPlayer.\n\n\u2022In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is on 0808 2000 247.
