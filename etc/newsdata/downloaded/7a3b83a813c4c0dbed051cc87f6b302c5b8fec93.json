REUTERS/Michael Hawkins/File Photo\n\nThe 56-year-old Bernier - a former minister of foreign affairs and industry - founded the populist People\u2019s Party of Canada (PPC) a year ago after narrowly losing his bid for the leadership of the main opposition Conservative Party to Andrew Scheer.\n\nIn his parting speech, Bernier, who is from the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, repeatedly attacked Scheer and deemed the party \u201ctoo intellectually and morally corrupt to be reformed.\u201d\n\nBernier has since stolen a page from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s playbook - and that of European populists like Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini - proposing measures unheard of in contemporary Canadian mainstream politics.\n\nThey include pledging to build a fence at the U.S. border to crack down on asylum seekers, slashing immigration levels, rejecting the idea that climate change is caused by humans and defunding the public broadcaster.\n\nHe even found time to attack 16-year-old Swedish climate advocate Greta Thunberg, calling her mentally unstable.\n\nBernier\u2019s contempt for political correctness and his rejection of multiculturalism as a \u201ccult of diversity\u201d could pose a real problem for the more moderate Scheer, who is in a tight race with Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ahead of the Oct. 21 national vote.\n\nThe PPC is polling between 1% and 3% nationally and Bernier risks losing even his own seat south of Quebec City. But if he grows more popular, it could split the right-of-center vote and hand parties on the left, including the Liberals, seats they would not have otherwise won.\n\n\u201cEight to 10 Conservative seats are in play ... because the People\u2019s Party is siphoning off 5% or 6% of the support\u201d in those districts, pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research said. \u201cIf Bernier climbs to 5% or 10%, it\u2019s a Liberal win.\u201d\n\nIn speeches across the country and on social media, Bernier targets Scheer as a \u201cfake Conservative\u201d whose policies are virtually the same as Trudeau\u2019s.\n\nScheer \u201chas no clear principles or program,\u201d Bernier said in his first party conference, held in a casino hotel in Quebec last month. \u201cHe\u2019s pandering to every interest group in the country.\u201d\n\nBernier was initially shut out of two official leaders\u2019 debates set for next month, but organizers later said he could take part. That will put him on the national stage alongside Scheer and Trudeau.\n\n\u201cI look forward to holding him to account publicly for his intolerant views,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nScheer has largely shrugged off Bernier\u2019s criticism, saying he is focused on defeating Trudeau. A Conservative official said the PPC \u201cis a party that\u2019s just going nowhere.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019M AUTHENTIC\u2019\n\nRick Anderson, a former Conservative campaign director, said the debates would allow Bernier to cast himself as the only leader in touch with what many voters are really thinking, a man prepared to say things no one else dares say on topics such as immigration and Canadian identity.\n\n\u201cThe debates ... will probably more than double Bernier\u2019s support,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Liberals know that and they\u2019re counting on that being at Scheer\u2019s expense.\u201d\n\nMore than 20% of Canada\u2019s population was born in another country, the highest proportion among the Group of Seven industrialized nations, and the country\u2019s multiculturalism has long been touted as a source of pride.\n\nSo there is also a risk that Bernier will make Scheer look like \u201cthe voice of reason\u201d among moderates who have been drifting back and forth between Liberals and Conservatives, Frank Graves of EKOS Research polling company said.\n\nBernier\u2019s famous \u201cMad Max\u201d nickname - after the Mel Gibson movie character - dates back to his losing effort for the Conservative leadership. In a Facebook post with his head photoshopped onto Gibson\u2019s body, Bernier said he was \u201cmad about government waste\u201d and \u201cpolitics as usual,\u201d among other things.\n\nWhile still a Conservative, Bernier increasingly turned into a square peg who stood out. Now he is embracing his inner maverick and the kind of identity politics in fashion south of the border.\n\nWhen asked by Reuters at the PPC conference if he considered himself Canada\u2019s Trump, he said no.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m myself. I\u2019m authentic,\u201d he said.", "description": "Maxime \"Mad Max\" Bernier, one of the most right-wing figures ever seen in Canadian federal politics, has a score to settle and nothing to lose - a potent mix that could shape the outcome of next month's national election.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431485869&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0AE-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
