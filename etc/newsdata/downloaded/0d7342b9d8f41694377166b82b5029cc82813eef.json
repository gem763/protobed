In May one of them pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder funds over the case.\n\nIn emailed response for comment, Privinvest spokesman on the Mozambique case, Jeffrey Birnbaum, said the businessman did nothing wrong.\n\n\"Mr Safa cannot comment on why the Mozambique government has sought to institute proceedings against him personally\" until he has seen details of the claim.\n\n\"He does not accept that the English Court has jurisdiction over him, and in any event, denies any wrongdoing,\" Birnbaum said.\n\nBirnbaum said Privinvest delivered on its contractual commitments and took \"extraordinary steps to help make the Mozambique projects succeed\", but the Mozambican entities \"failed to hold up their end of the agreements\".\n\nPrivinvest had earlier this year instituted proceedings against the Mozambique government, which included \"arbitration to recover losses and damages arising from breach of contract,\" the spokesman said.\n\nSafa's lawyer Laffont told AFP in France that the jurisdiction of the London court is contested, adding neither him nor his company are facing criminally prosecution either in the US or in Mozambique.", "description": "Mozambique has started legal action against a French-Lebanese billionaire, Iskandar Safa, whose shipbuilding company is at the heart of a $2 billion debt scandal, officials said Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8525/dd3fd8e495f94cae9afca47560c4f552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-04"}
