I never wanted to take an innocent person\u2019s life,\u201d Guyger testified, adding that at the time she had believed her life was in danger. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry. I have to live with this every single day.\u201d\n\nNone of the 12 jurors betrayed emotion as Guyger wept.\n\nGuyger, who is white, said she mistakenly thought she had parked on her own level in her apartment building\u2019s parking garage after her shift.\n\nShe told jurors that the shooting \u201cis not about hate, it\u2019s about being scared.\u201d\n\nThe judge briefly halted the proceedings to allow Guyger to compose herself.\n\nIt is relatively rare for criminal defendants to testify in their own defence at trial since it subjects them to cross-examination by prosecutors who will attempt to poke holes in their story.\n\n\u201cWhen you shot him twice, you intended to kill him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Assistant District Attorney Jason Hermus asked Guyger.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she responded, in a calm voice.\n\nHermus sharply questioned Guyger about why she performed virtually no emergency procedures to try to save Jean, and why in her panicked call to 911 just after the shooting she never said she thought Jean had a weapon or that she had been scared for her life. The officer said she was in panic and that her mind was racing at that time.\n\nThe prosecutor also pressed Guyger on why she simply did not choose to not enter the apartment she thought was her own if she felt her life was in danger. The officer acknowledged that she could have done that - and that Jean would still be alive today if she had.\n\nGuyger faces life in prison if found guilty of murder.\n\nThe jury could also find her not guilty, or guilty of the lesser crimes of manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide. Manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while she would face a total of two years in prison for criminally negligent homicide.\n\nThe shooting, one of a series of high-profile killings of unarmed black men and teens by white U.S. police officers, sparked street protests, particularly after prosecutors initially moved to charge Guyger with manslaughter, a charge for killing without malice.\n\nIn contrast to cases like the killings of Michael Brown in Missouri and Philando Castile in Minnesota, Guyger shot Jean while she was off duty, rather than while responding to a reported crime.\n\nDuring the trial, Guyger\u2019s defence attorney, Robert Rogers, said she was \u201con autopilot\u201d after a long work day on Sept. 6, 2018, when she mistakenly parked on the wrong floor in the garage and was able to enter Jean\u2019s apartment because he had left the door slightly ajar.\n\nHermus told the jury of four men and eight women that Guyger missed blatant clues that she was not in her own apartment - including the smell of marijuana smoke - because she was distracted after a 16-minute phone conversation with her former police partner during her commute. Guyger testified that the call was in relation to work.", "description": "A former Dallas police officer charged with murdering an unarmed neighbour when she walked into his apartment thinking it was her own, wept as she testified in her own defence on Friday, saying she asks God daily for forgiveness.", "authors": ["Bruce Tamaso", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
