A somewhat substantive critique, and unsurprising given that Washington Democrats are generally Democrats who like the current system of lobbyist-run government and the money it puts in their pockets. Warren, a longtime consumer advocate and foe of big business, is undoubtedly not their favorite member of their party.\n\nFinally, these Washington Democrats say, Warren \u201cshares too many of the attributes that sank Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nConsider that Elizabeth Warren is not married to Bill Clinton. Consider that she has not been accused of covering up her husband\u2019s transgressions including by threatening women who say he forced himself on them. There are people who believe that Hillary Clinton has literally had people murdered. This is not an accusation I have heard leveled against Warren. She is in no way affiliated with the Clinton Foundation. She was not Secretary of State and did not have a long, drawn-out email scandal. Warren is far more liberal than Clinton\u2014which should be a positive factor for voters who preferred Bernie Sanders.\n\nWhat do Warren and Clinton have in common? They are both notably hard-working older women. That\u2019s about their only shared attribute. Clinton doesn\u2019t even wear glasses.\n\nSo why, then, is Warren, according to Politico\u2019s Washington Democrats, in danger of being \u201cwritten off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground\u201d?\n\nBecause she\u2019s a woman.\n\nDeclaring one\u2019s intention to run for president automatically makes a person less \u201clikable,\u201d as a portion of the country will fundamentally disagree with any given platform. Politicians usually find sustained popularity only in retirement or death, if then.\n\nYet nobody hand-wrings over the \u201clikability\u201d of men, in politics or otherwise. Men in politics do not have to be likable. Donald Trump might be the least likable person on the planet. He starred on a TV show that was literally about him being mean. He is aggressive and abrasive and his voice sounds like if nails on a chalkboard and a foghorn had a baby and it just nagged at you endlessly, forever. Mitt Romney isn\u2019t likable. He\u2019s potentially a robot. And not a charming C3PO robot, but a really, really dull one. Mike Pence is at best boring and at worst terrifying.\n\nBut for women and girls, the demand to be likable begins practically at birth. The feminist scholar Iris Marion Young wrote an essay about this, called Throwing Like a Girl: A Phenomenology of Feminine Body Comportment. Many girls threw less well than boys because they restricted their own motions. While boys wind up and then extend their whole arm and torso in a pitch, many girls are too self-conscious to move their bodies in that way, lest they look unattractive or silly. This is fundamentally about likability. Appearance is a big part of what makes women \u201clikable\u201d in our society.\n\nLikability is what gave us Lean In and Boss Bitch. Women can\u2019t be bosses without being bitches, so why not embrace the moniker? Lean In\u2019s fundamental belief is that it\u2019s on women to force themselves into being noticed, or heard, or promoted, or acknowledged, or whatever\u2014not on the workplace to be an iota less shitty. Do more work, Lean In tells women. But don\u2019t forget to be likable while doing it!\n\nLikability is why women have a harder time seeking and getting raises than men do. A man asks for a raise and it\u2019s normal. A woman asks for a raise and she\u2019s pushy or demanding. And that\u2019s if the woman even can ask for a raise, if she has not been too ground down from spending a lifetime making herself smaller and quieter and whatever else to be more likable, or at least less unlikable. And one of the greatest sins of unlikability is a woman who doesn\u2019t try to conceal how much hard work goes into doing what she does. Women are expected to be effortless, so the fact that Warren and Clinton are so evidently hard-working is something they have to overcome, to be likable, instead of something that recommends them.\n\nThe musical duo The Blow released a song last year titled \u201cThe Woman You Want Her to Be,\u201d which goes, \u201cShe\u2019ll be smart enough to know if you want her to not be smart or just to not show it\u2026 She\u2019s an infinite yes yes yes yes / there will always be more of her, unless of course you\u2019d prefer less, she can do that too, just let her know what you want her to fix, she can take care of it.\u201d\n\nThis is, in a nutshell, the trap of likability. Not only do women have to be likable, but being likable as a woman is impossible. To be smart, but not too smart, to be both more and less\u2014these are demands that fundamentally can\u2019t be met. In expecting Warren, or any woman, to be \u201clikable,\u201d we are essentially closing the door on the chance of a woman ever being president.", "description": "Women are expected to be effortless, so the fact that Warren and Clinton\u2014who have little else in common\u2014are so evidently hard-working is considered damning instead of an asset.", "authors": ["Danielle Tcholakian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1546659619/190104-danielle-warren-tease_oe4bco", "published_at": "2019-01-05"}
