They\u2019d had the whistleblower\u2019s complaint in their hands since the night before, a summary of the actual call to Ukraine, the Inspector General\u2019s letter outlining his interviews with suspect officials in the White House, and cameras trained on them for three hours.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Maguire was perfect. He said he couldn\u2019t answer questions about privileged conversations with the president because doing so would destroy his relationship with him. Maguire is a tragic example of how good people can be harmed by Donald Trump without realizing it.\n\nThe Democrats frequently put aside the guns smoking around Trump and the disturbing revelations in the whistleblower\u2019s bombshell report made public Thursday morning to instead wade deep into the weeds of executive privilege, the jurisdiction of the DNI, the scope of the whistleblower statute and other ephemera. And they did that while treating Maguire, who radiates integrity, at times as though he were a flunky covering for Trump rather than a servant of the executive branch.\n\nTo use Maguire\u2019s favorite adjective, he was \u201cprudent\u201d to a fault at the hearing while explaining why he\u2019d initially withheld the complaint from Congress, despite the statute requiring notification. Another acting director in an administration full of them, Maguire defined his post way too narrowly.\n\nHe said that he didn\u2019t see the president as falling under his intelligence purview. Mistakenly trusting that others in government took their oath as seriously as he did, he asked the White House and the Justice Department, both alleged to be involved in the cover-up of the call to the Ukranian president and putting it into an unmarked server (Hillary, are you listening?), what to do.\n\nMaguire said he totally trusted and believed the reports of the whistleblower and the Inspector General, by the way also a Trump appointee, but he didn\u2019t always act like it. Why would he ask the president\u2019s men if the rogue operation was privileged and, if so, would the White House and DOJ waive their privilege? Of course, they said yes to the former and no to the latter. Maguire looked genuinely surprised when he found out that the FBI to which he referred the complaint never conducted an investigation. He didn\u2019t seem to know what Rudy Giuliani was up to. In the Trump White House, there\u2019s no place left for apolitical career appointees. Would Dan Coats, the former Indiana senator who held the job, hae been so oblivious?\n\nBarr Can\u2019t Be Surprised Trump Offered His Services to Ukraine. He Predicted as Much.\n\nStill, Maguire was no John Ehrlichman. He only had high praise for the IG and the whistleblower. He stayed temperate throughout, ignoring the bait that members of both parties offered and keeping his opinions largely to himself, narrowly defining his authority and giving just the facts as he saw them.\n\nSpeaking of facts that could have been highlighted at this meeting, we had a confession from Trump that trickled out in his answers to questions on the fly in the hallways of the U.N. With less subtlety than a mob boss and because he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with anything he does, he admitted asking the Ukrainian president \u201cabout Biden\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d and that both should be investigated in coordination with Bill Barr, the supposed attorney general, and Giuliani, the president\u2019s private attorney. Realizing what he\u2019d done, Trump later got Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to go on camera to say he was fine with the phone call, which came across as a hostage saying he was happy being kidnapped. Anything to get his shoulder-mounted anti-tank Javelins.\n\nStory continues", "description": "NICHOLAS KAMM/GettyIn the first hearing of the new world we\u2019re in, you would have thought the Democrats\u2019 mission was not to impeach the president but to impeach the witness before them.\u00a0That would be acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, a Navy Seal for 34 years and a public servant", "authors": ["Margaret Carlson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Tt2EBN1KdBcGiNYRRwmkqg--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/4b3d47d79b04d90aa227faf8c7b5d381", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
