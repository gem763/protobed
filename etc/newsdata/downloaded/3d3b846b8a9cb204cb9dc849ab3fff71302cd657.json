Kamala Harris' presidential campaign staff announced Thursday morning that they are going to double their resources in Iowa, adding another 60 organizers and opening 10 new offices around the state.\n\nIn total, the influx of staffers puts 125 organizers in Iowa. Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez said the added workers are new to the campaign \u2014 not coming from another state. The investment also raises the number of campaign offices from seven to 17.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m f------ moving to Iowa,\u201d she said to a fellow senator, according to a reporter who overheard the comment.\n\nThe move reflects a need to finish strong in Iowa, Communications Director Lily Adams said during a Thursday morning conference call. Harris, who will be in Iowa from Thursday afternoon through the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday, will also tour the state every week in October.\n\n\"The emphasis is on Iowa,\" Adams said. \"We've got to put Iowa first.\"\n\nAdams added that she thought no more than five or six credible candidates emerge from Iowa.\n\nRodriguez said of Iowa, \u201cWe want to make sure we have a strong top-3 finish. I think that will continue to give us a slingshot to go into that early primary state calendar.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes two days after a Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll placed Harris in fifth, with 5% of voters saying she was their first choice. (The poll put former Vice President Joe Biden first with 31%.) In June, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom/CNN Iowa Poll found that Harris was also in fifth, with 7% of participants picking her first.\n\nOn Thursday, Harris, of California, will be in Eastern Iowa, starting in Coralville and Cedar Rapids. She will then visit Waterloo and Cedar Falls on Friday, followed by an appearance at an LGBTQ-focused forum at Coe College in Cedar Rapids.\n\nHarris will then march with striking McDonald's workers Saturday morning, followed by an appearance at the Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa's capital city.\n\nContributing: Aamer Madhani\n\nThis article originally appeared on Des Moines Register: To make up ground, U.S. Sen.
