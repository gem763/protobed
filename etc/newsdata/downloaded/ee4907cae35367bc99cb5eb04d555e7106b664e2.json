As of last season\u2019s Opening Day, fully 27% of its players were foreign-born, most from the Caribbean and South and Central America. That region\u2019s presence in the league is so great that the Miami Marlins have ordered their entire system\u2019s coaching staff \u2014 from the big leagues to the minors \u2014 to take up Spanish. (The idea seems to be that the team is so bad in English that speaking Spanish instead could only help.) But baseball also has a healthy number of players from Japan, South Korea, Canada, and various European countries.\n\nWhat baseball has not been is expansionist, at least compared to other American sports leagues. Rather than set up shop around the world, it has instead hoovered up the best players from across the globe: it has invited the world in rather than set out to conquer it. MLB played a few games in London and Japan this summer, but its global footprint is nothing compared to that of the NFL or especially the NBA.\n\nSouth Korean and Japanese fans may catch the occasional MLB game on television (and I can attest that it\u2019s fun to watch baseball early in the morning by virtue of the time difference), but they also have their own local teams to which they are passionately devoted.\n\nA few years ago that may have looked like a weakness: MLB was losing the globalization race. But now that\u2019s not so clear. The NBA\u2019s growing reliance on China \u2014 NBA China is now valued at more than $4 billion \u2014 has put it in the decidedly uncomfortable position of having to toe Beijing\u2019s line on political issues that have nothing to do with sports. That\u2019s created big headaches for its ownership and its players. Steph Curry, for instance, has been made to answer (or, rather, not answer) awkward questions about China, simply by virtue of his league\u2019s Chinese operations. Neither Yankees star Aaron Judge nor Astros MVP Jose Altuve will face such problems.\n\nSoccer\u2019s FIFA, the organization governing the most international of sports, is another cautionary tale. Simply by virtue of being everywhere, it does a lot of business in corrupt, authoritarian states. Qatar, the Islamist entrepot, is accused of bribing its way to win hosting rights to the 2022 World Cup. FIFA has also clammed up on Qatar\u2019s deplorable human rights record, and allegations that it has used slave labor to construct the facilities that will be used for the games.\n\nThe Olympics ran into similar troubles, especially with questions surrounding the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi.\n\nSports expansionism may have looked wise just a few years ago. But in this era of global retrenchment, baseball\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d posture is a home run.\n\n\u2022 Ethan Epstein is deputy opinion editor of The Washington Times.
