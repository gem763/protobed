More and more white shoe lobbying firms are taking on hemp clients. Universities are winning grants to research hemp. Tobacco companies are getting in on the action, looking for their next big move.\n\n\u201cThe lobbying is a sign of the economics behind this,\u201d said Eric Steenstra, president of Vote Hemp, an early grassroots hemp trade association that has worked since 2005 to legalize the crop. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s so many people interested in it tells you that there\u2019s business happening there \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nSome estimates predict the U.S. hemp industry could be valued at more than $26 billion by 2025, propelled in large part by the rapid growth of CBD, which is derived from hemp and now infuses everything from lotion to lemonade. And hemp can be used in seemingly countless ways, from textiles to medicinal products to building materials.\n\nUniversities also have gotten into the game. Institutions such as Cornell, Oregon State University and the University of Kentucky have cited work addressing hemp research. That work has paid off for Cornell, which was awarded $500,000 by Congress in August to establish a hemp seed bank.\n\nPyxus International, a tobacco company formerly known as Alliance One International, recently signed a research agreement with Cornell that focuses on hemp production and CBD. That's now the focus of some of its lobbying as the company makes new investments beyond tobacco.\n\nHemp lobbyists are united on the same goals: push the federal government to write rules that encourage growth of the so-far unregulated industry.\n\n\"One of the most acute issues, especially given projections for the industry\u2019s growth potential, is a lack of clear policies and regulatory frameworks on a federal level,\" Pyxus CEO Pieter Sikkel said. \"Farmers need certainty that there will be a market for their crops, not just today, but in the future, to effectively meet the consumer demand for hemp-derived products.\"\n\nThe formation of industry trade associations also marks a turning point in the Washington lobbying scene. Now that hemp is legal, two of the U.S. Hemp Roundtable's top priorities are helping states pass legislation permitting hemp programs and pressuring the FDA to issue guidance on CBD, said Jonathan Miller, the group's lobbyist and Kentucky Democrat.\n\nThe industry is also concerned about ensuring access to banking services for cannabis companies and wants to see the Safe Banking Act, passed by the House last month, signed into law. The legislation would allow banks to do business with cannabis companies without fear of federal punishment.\n\nAnd before Walmart and Patagonia had their hands in hemp, there was Droz. Starting a decade ago, he ran a one-man, one-issue lobby shop for Vote Hemp, who at the time was the only group advocating for the plant. He used to store hemp paraphernalia in his hemp composite briefcase such as granola bars and chapstick.\n\nHis opening message was simple: Hemp is not the same as marijuana. They may come from the same plant species, but unlike marijuana, hemp contains minuscule levels of THC, the compound that gives users a psychoactive high when smoked or ingested.\n\nOnce Droz's audience wrapped their heads around that key distinction, he then told anyone who would listen about the plant\u2019s potential to give American farmers a huge leg up as a new source of revenue, as well as its ability to be used in clothing, building materials, food and countless other ways.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to normalize hemp so that people could see hemp was another bio-based resource, completely different from the stigma and cultural associations with marijuana,\u201d Droz said. \u201cWe were trying to break those stereotypes that were pretty well ingrained back in 2009.\u201d\n\nVote Hemp was trying to rally support for the Industrial Hemp Farming Act, which would have legalized hemp production. Gradually, members started joining as co-sponsors. Former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) were the first sponsors in their respective chambers. Another early champion was Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.).\n\nEventually, seeing a major economic opportunity for farmers in his home state and elsewhere, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell got on board with hemp. His support led to an amendment being tacked on to the 2014 farm bill that permitted states to run hemp pilot programs. After that, the hemp floodgates opened and pressure grew for the crop to be legalized for industrial production nationwide, which happened with McConnell's continued support last year.\n\nDroz said he's not surprised to see hemp become legalized but he was caught off guard by how quickly things evolved. And he's aware of how industry participants have changed.\n\n\u201cHemp is a microcosm of how things get done,\" he said. \"As its been growing, it's been changing. It's losing part of its 'let's do it for the American people\u2019 and now it\u2019s more \u2018how can big companies get bigger.\u2019 It is a model of that.\u201d\n\nJanie Boschma contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a0/c0/798f74994c5cb69af52560b3b4e5/191017-hemp-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
