He is seen outside court\n\nA judge\u2019s son who took part in Britain\u2019s biggest ever tax fraud that saw celebrities swindled out of \u00a3108million must pay back \u00a3250,000, the Old Bailey heard today.\n\nJonathan Anwyl, 46, helped run an investment scheme favoured by comedians, sports stars and relatives of politicians.\n\nHe was part of a group led by scientist Michael Richards, 57, who used their professional reputations to convince super-rich investors they were running cutting-edge research and development projects in Brazil and China.\n\nThey assured their celebrity investors they would be eligible for tax relief and encouraged them to make claims to HMRC for a total of \u00a3107.92m.\n\nBut the operation was a sham and members of the group siphoned off huge sums for their own \u2018secret money box accounts\u2019 in Switzerland and Holland.\n\nThose targeted included a singer and a former England footballer.\n\nOf the \u00a365m subscribed cash, \u00a320m was stolen by the group and used to buy houses around the world, make their own investments and maintain a luxury lifestyle.\n\nOxford and Eton-educated Anwyl used some of the proceeds to pay \u00a3788,000 off the mortgage of a house he owned in Australia with his French wife Anne.\n\nHis mother, Shirley Anwyl QC, was a circuit judge for 13 years and resident judge at Woolwich Crown Court until her retirement in 2008.\n\nAnwyl, of Ringmer, East Sussex, was jailed for five and a half years in November 2017 after he was convicted of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.\n\nThe initiative involved several other people including Michael Richards (left) and Eudoros Demetriou\n\nToday Mr Justice Edis found Anwyl benefited by \u00a32,209,412.46 from the fraud but has to pay back just \u00a3253,934.47 or serve another two years in jail.\n\nRichards, of Chelsea Harbour, southwest London, was also convicted of cheating the public revenue and jailed for 11 years after the trial in 2017.\n\nHe bought a home in Sussex using some of his share of the proceeds before selling it to fund the purchase of another property in Dubai.\n\nRichards also splashed out \u00a332,000 on a diamond engagement ring for his girlfriend from luxury jewellers Boodles.\n\nProsecutor Charles Miskin QC told jurors Anwyl was reeled in by Richards and others in the plot which ran between April 6, 2004 and March 4, 2010.\n\nThe father of one insisted the company was being run legitimately but after a 10-month trial costing the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds, jurors convicted Anwyl and Richards of conspiring to cheat the public revenue.\n\nBarrister Rodney Whiston-Dew, 68, Robert Gold, 51, and Eudoros Demetriou, 80, former senior executive at EMI and Warner Music, were also convicted of involvement in the fraud.\n\nWhiston-Dew was jailed for 10 years; Richards and Gold for 11 years each; and Demetriou for six years.\n\nRodney Whiston-Dew, who was jailed for 10 years\n\nMr Justice Edis today ruled Gold had profited \u00a37,096,712.30 and must pay back \u00a32,643,677.25 or face another nine years in prison.\n\nMr Miskin had described the investment scheme being marketed as an \u2018attractive, ethical, green commercial enterprise with tax benefits to those who invested\u2019.\n\nBut he added the whole thing had been dishonestly created and sold by the defendants.\n\n\u2018This was an investment scheme devised by very clever if not brilliant professional men who used their reputations to promote and advance it,\u2019 said Mr Miskin.\n\n\u2018There was a hidden structure behind it which they deliberately and fraudulently concealed [from HMRC].\u2019\n\nProsecutors claimed that the investments by the \u2018high net worth\u2019 individuals could be broken down into 80% capital loans which \u2018did not exist\u2019 and 20% cash contributions.\n\nThose cash amounts were first transferred to CPT, which had been commissioned to undertake the scientific research on deforested land in Brazil and China, and on to offshore lenders Environmental Guarantee Corporation (EGC).\n\nIncorporated on the Isle of Man, EGC then purported to lend what amounted to the investors own money back to some of them and circulated the funds between the various entities under the group\u2019s collective control.\n\nOf the \u00a365m obtained from the investors only a quarter was actually spent by CPT in Brazil, China and elsewhere - roughly six per cent of the \u00a3270m promised.\n\nMr Miskin added: \u2018Large amounts were simply siphoned off into secret money box accounts for some of them.\u2019\n\nInvestors\u2019 funds were placed in CPT\u2019s account in the Netherlands and, once available after the circular movements, siphoned into another secret Swiss account in the name of CPL.\n\nFrom there it was dispersed by the defendants.\n\nSentencing the fraudsters nearly two years ago Mr Justice Edis had blasted their \u2018utter dishonesty, sophisticated planning and astonishing greed hidden behind a mask of concern for the environment\u2019.\n\nThat added \u2018an element of hypocrisy and cynicism to this case which is deeply distasteful\u2019, he said.\n\nConfiscation proceedings against the remaining defendants will take place at the Old Bailey on 28 October.", "description": "Jonathan Anwyl, 46, helped run an investment scheme favoured by comedians, sports stars and relatives of politicians, the Old Bailey heard today.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/17/19700360-0-image-a-84_1571068809553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
