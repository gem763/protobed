After two thrilling wins here at the U.S. Open, she has quickly become a crowd favorite with her powerful groundstrokes and an energetic game.\n\nOn Saturday night, Gauff faced her biggest test, a third-round matchup in Arthur Ashe Stadium against defending champion Naomi Osaka, the world\u2019s No.1-ranked player.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just curious to see how my game matches up against her,\u201d Gauff said ahead of the match. \u201cObviously I want to win.\u201d\n\nAlthough Gauff may very well develop into one of the sport\u2019s best players, she isn\u2019t quite there yet. Osaka, 21, controlled most of the rallies and was stronger physically, in a 6-3, 6-0 win that took one hour and five minutes.\n\nIn an error-riddled first set, Osaka raced out to a 3-0 lead, hitting seven winners. Gauff clawed back to take the next two games but continued to struggle to hold her serve. In the eighth game of the match, Osaka broke Gauff\u2019s serve for the third time in the set and then held serve to take the set 6-3.\n\n\u201cIt was hard for me to take control of the points,\u201d Gauff said after the match.\n\nIn the opening game of the second set, Gauff quickly fell behind 0-30 on her serve. After hitting her next serve into the net, Gauff swung her racket in disgust. The crowd offered encouragement and cheered loudly when Gauff won the next point. But that wasn\u2019t enough as Osaka showed her experience by exploiting her younger opponent\u2019s weakness, breaking Gauff\u2019s serve in that game and two other times in the set to close out the match at love in the second set. Gauff only held serve in one of her seven service games.\n\nOverall, Osaka hit 24 winners and had 17 unforced errors in the match, while Gauff had eight winners and 24 unforced errors.\n\nAfter the match, with Gauff in tears, Osaka asked her younger rival to join her for the on-court post-match interview. \u201cI definitely was wanting to leave the court because I\u2019m not the type of person who wants to cry in front of everyone,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that she kind of convinced me to do it.\u201d\n\nOsaka got emotional while addressing Gauff\u2019s family and friends, saying how remarkable it was that two girls from the same Florida area both have made it to tennis\u2019s grandest stage. \u201cCoco, I think you are amazing,\u201d she said.\n\nOsaka explained that the fans inside the stadium probably weren\u2019t going to have a chance to hear Gauff\u2019s thoughts on the match, so she thought it would be a good idea if they both addressed the crowd.\n\nEarlier this week, Osaka said she saw something familiar when she spotted Gauff in the locker room. \u201cI feel she\u2019s a little bit like me,\u201d Osaka said. She just had her headphones on. I was, like, \u2018Oh, looks familiar.\u2019 I just went up and talked a little bit. She\u2019s super sweet.\u201d\n\nBoth players said their fathers are friends, and they recalled a practice session two years ago in Miami, when Gauff was only 13.\n\n\u201cThat was super cool. I was able to keep the ball on the court. I was super nervous,\u201d Gauff said.\n\nAfter winning back-to-back Grand Slam titles, with victories at the U.S. Open last year and the Australian Open in January, Osaka split with her coach Sascha Bajin. She has struggled with her consistency since the change and entered this tournament with concerns over a knee injury. Osaka will lose the No. 1 ranking if No. 2 Ashleigh Barty reaches the quarterfinals here or if No. 3 Karolina Pliskova reaches the semifinals. Entering Saturday\u2019s play, eight of Osaka\u2019s 10 losses this year have come against players ranked outside the top 20.\n\nBut Osaka has begun to regain her form at Flushing Meadows. She won over fans during last year\u2019s final, when she showed remarkable poise as Serena Williams was feuding with chair umpire Carlos Ramos.\n\nAlthough she is wearing a brace on her left knee, Osaka hasn\u2019t appeared to be restricted in her movement. \u201cThe thing with me, though, is I get better as the tournament goes on,\u201d Osaka said. \u201dIt\u2019s not even a skill sort of thing, it\u2019s just I trust myself more.\u201d\n\nShe now advances to the fourth round, where she will face No. 13 seed Belinda Bencic. Bencic has already beaten Osaka twice this year and leads 3-1 in head-to-head matchups.\n\nGauff was trying to become the youngest player to defeat the world\u2019s No. 1 player since 1991, when then-15-year-old Jennifer Capriati defeated Monica Seles in San Diego. Coincidentally, Capriati\u2019s early success and subsequent off-the-court struggles led to a rule on the number of matches females can play before they turn 18.\n\nAt most, Gauff will be able to play five events before she turns 16 on March 13, although a merit increase is possible. Gauff entered the U.S. Open ranked No. 140, but should be on the edge of the top 100 when the WTA rankings are updated after the tournament.\n\nGauff earned $163,000 for advancing to the third round.\n\nDespite the loss in singles, her U.S. Open isn\u2019t over yet. Gauff and 17-year-old Caty McNally will take on the No. 9-seeded women\u2019s doubles team of Nicole Melichar and Kveta Peschke on Sunday.\n\nThe Osaka-Gauff matchup has been the talk of the tournament around the grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in recent days. Even Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam winner who had the evening off, said she was interested in the outcome.\n\n\u201cI definitely think it\u2019s the future of women\u2019s tennis. And I\u2019m really excited to just be a fan girl and kind of watch,\u201d Williams said Friday. Williams, the No. 8 seed, is slated to face No. 22 seed Petra Martic on Sunday afternoon in a fourth-round match.\n\nFour American women are in the round of 16, including Williams, No. 10 seed Madison Keys, Taylor Townsend and Kristie Ahn.\n\nWrite to Jim Chairusmi at jim.chairusmi@wsj.com", "description": "Naomi Osaka, the world\u2019s No. 1-ranked player, ended the run of 15-year-old Coco Gauff in the third round of the U.S. Open with a 6-3, 6-0 win that took a little over an hour.", "authors": ["Jim Chairusmi", "Jim.Chairusmi Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103171/social"}
