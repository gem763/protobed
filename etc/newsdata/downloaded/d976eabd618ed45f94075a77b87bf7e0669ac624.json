Baldwin\u2019s Trump was nowhere to be seen. As Pence put it, he \u201chas more important things to deal with\u2014he's meeting with an alligator breeder about filling the moat at the border.\u201d\n\nThey were soon joined by Mike Pompeo, played the night\u2019s first big guest star, Matthew Broderick, who attempted to channel some of his Ferris Bueller energy but did not seem to be impersonating the secretary of state in any meaningful way.\n\n\u201cListen, guys, we're going to be just fine,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cWe need to close ranks, you know? Like the mafia.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, yeah, except the mafia was like, smart,\u201d Pompeo replied. \u201cThey didn't go on Fox News and tell people the crimes before they did them.\u201d On his way out of the room, he added, \u201cHey, impeachment moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around, you might miss it.\u201d\n\nLater, Giuliani returned from his latest Fox News appearance still wearing his stage makeup\u2014as Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Joker. \u201cI killed on Hannity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDid you say killed?\u201d Pence asked warily.\n\n\u201cThat's right, and I'll kill again!\u201d the maniacal Giuliani added.", "description": "This week\u2019s cold open sketch also featured guest star Matthew Broderick as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2558,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570334653/SNL_gty39x", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
