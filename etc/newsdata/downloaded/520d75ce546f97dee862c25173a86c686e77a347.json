In it, she and Morgan can be heard making decidedly insensitive remarks as first drag queen Miz Cracker and then transgender model Yasmine Petty took to the runway.\n\nIn the hastily deleted Instagram story, Yasmine is seen in a low-cut dress strutting down the runway while Dorinda can he heard in the background saying, \u201cWell with a body like that, it\u2019s a guy. That\u2019s a guy.\u201d\n\nSonja responds: \u201cWith a body like that it\u2019s a guy, you\u2019re absolutely right. Oh lord.\u201d\n\nMorgan and Medley issued a swift, no-holds-barred apology, telling Page Six Style in a statement: \u201cWe have a history as longstanding supporters of the LGBTQ community in many ways and apologize for our offensive comments at the fashion show.\u201d\n\nBut will this be enough to save the women\u2019s careers as reality stars?\n\nThere was no shortage of digital commenters Tuesday night urging Bravo to immediately sanction the pair.\n\nPetty told Page Six Style after the show that the comments could be heard on the catwalk, saying: \u201cI was really excited to do the fashion show for Garo Sparo for New York Fashion Week because he was using models of diversity, and I knew they were filming the Housewives of New York and I knew they were front row and literally, as I was walking down the runway, I heard them making these statements.\u201d\n\nPetty noted that the women can be seen laughing as she walks down the runway in another video taken from the event\u2014although it is unclear why.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty disheartening and disappointing, especially this day and age and being in New York City,\u201d Petty added.\n\n\u201cMy philosophy is that people can\u2019t choose their sexual orientation. They can\u2019t choose their gender identity. They can\u2019t choose or not choose to have a disability or a mental illness or even their race, but things people can choose to do is not to be rude and cruel to people over things they have no control over.\u201d\n\nPublicist Daniel Miles Lee Hue gave perhaps the clearest hint of a damage-limitation plan the pair might deploy in their efforts to try to calm the bubbling outrage, telling HollywoodLife.com \u201cSonja is a dear friend and former client of mine. Although I wasn\u2019t there in person, nor have I spoke to her about it, I doubt her comments were meant to be offensive. Sonja has been involved in the LGBT community since I met her over five years ago. If anything, I think her comment presents a generational misunderstanding, where older generations aren\u2019t as educated on how to appropriately celebrate members of our trans community.\n\n\u201cThis is a teachable moment where I hope affluent cis-gendered women can learn to practice more restraint and sensitivity, and hopefully our trans sisters can help educate and bring along willing allies to help join the movement for trans equality. This is an example where we can\u2019t let perfection become the enemy of the good and point out areas of opportunity where people can become more inclusive in their communication,\u201d he said.", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a guy... that\u2019s a guy,\u201d two RHONY stars can be heard snickering to each other as a trans model takes to the catwalk.
