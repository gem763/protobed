In a recent roundtable interview with TMZ, Gastelum said he\u2019d like to avenge his loss to Woodley some day, but Woodley was far from amused.\n\nSpeaking to TMZ himself in his \u201cThe Hollywood Beatdown\u201d show, Woodley was surprised to hear that Gastelum, who now competes at middleweight, wants to run things back.\n\n\u201cWhy? Why do you want to get your (expletive) whooped again,\u201d Woodley said. \u201cYou got beat on one foot. I played games with you. You didn\u2019t land one punch. You missed weight by about 10 pounds. I gave you your money back. I even seen your fat (expletive) on Metabolic Meals that you didn\u2019t obviously eat.\u201d\n\nAfter beating Gastelum, Woodley went on to challenge then welterweight champ Robbie Lawler, knocking him out in the first round to capture the title. Woodley handed Gastelum his first loss as a professional and prompted him to make the move up to middleweight. After going back and forth with 185 and 170, Gastelum settled at middleweight.\n\nBut Woodley doesn\u2019t appreciate Gastelum asking for a rematch, as he believes he\u2019s done nothing but praise him during his times on the analyst desk.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have no love for you, G. I ain\u2019t got no pity for you,\u201d Woodley said. \u201cI gave you mad props on the air, I gave you mad props on ESPN, I gave you mad props for the Israel (Adesanya) fight. I haven\u2019t had anything to say about you. I was respectful. I didn\u2019t bash you when you missed weight, and now you want to talk (expletive) about me? I will (expletive) you up right now. I will (expletive) you up in the octagon.\u201d\n\nWoodley said maybe if Gastelum was able to beat Adesanya for the interim middleweight title earlier this year and become champ, he would have entertained it, as his callout would have then had some weight on it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry over spilled milk, brother,\u201d Woodley said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had many opportunities to work your way back up to fighting me or work your way back up to saying \u2018I\u2019m the champion now, and now I\u2019m the middleweight king, and I want to fight Tyron. I want to avenge that.\u2019 And I will kindly come up there and whoop your fat (expletive).\u201d", "description": "Tyron Woodley blasted Kelvin Gastelum for saying that he'd like to run things back.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/kelvin-gastelum-tyron-woodley-ufc-183.jpg?w=640&h=430&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
