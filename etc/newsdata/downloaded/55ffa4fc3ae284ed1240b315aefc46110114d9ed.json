(Russia was listening and, we\u2019ve since learned, hopped right to it, as Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation showed.) Trump now faces an impeachment investigation in the House for pressuring Ukraine to dig up damaging information about the 2020 Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden. Heedless of the impeachment machinery whirring on Capitol Hill, he stood outside the White House on Thursday and told reporters that he\u2019d like to see the Chinese investigate the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son Hunter in their country.\n\nIn so many other arenas, Trump has denounced and ditched international cooperation. He pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement and the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, both of which Barack Obama had negotiated. He\u2019s questioned whether the NATO military alliance is worth the price. \u201cAmerica first\u201d was the slogan that helped Trump win the presidency. But he doesn\u2019t seem to believe it\u2019s the tactic that will help him keep it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Nicholas", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Trump-Biden-Ukraine-China"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
