That last question has become something of a doctrinal debate among technorati, but let me make it simple: most people want a tablet do to traditional tablet things.\n\n\u201cTablet things\u201d include browsing the web, watching movies, reading books, playing games. To do that stuff, you want a tablet that\u2019s thin, light, and reliable. You want a good screen and a long battery life. You also want something that doesn\u2019t cost as much as a full-on laptop because you already have a full-on laptop.\n\nAll of this makes the answer to our question incredibly easy. The best tablet for most people is the standard iPad.\n\nThis article was updated on January 25th, 2019.\n\nThe best tablet for most people: iPad (2018)\n\nThe iPad is the best tablet for most people because it\u2019s fast, reliable, good quality, and inexpensive. It was released in April 2018. By tech standards, that makes it long in the tooth, but don\u2019t worry about that: iPads last a long time, much longer than phones, and this iPad is plenty fast and more than powerful enough for most tablet things.\n\nAs I said in our review, I still think the iPad is one of the best deals in tech when you measure out what you get against what you\u2019re paying for. Because it runs iOS, it has a massive library of tablet-optimized apps and games. It is fast and simple to use, and it has a big-enough 9.7-inch screen and a battery you won\u2019t have to recharge all that often. You can use Touch ID to log in, and there\u2019s even an honest-to-god 3.5mm headphone jack for your headphones so you don\u2019t have to go hunting around for dongles. It also works with an Apple Pencil, if that\u2019s your thing.\n\nAre there downsides? Sure. But I don\u2019t think they matter that much to most people. The 2018 iPad is not the most advanced tablet you can buy. It doesn\u2019t have the iPad Pro\u2019s nearly bezel-less display and Face ID. It lacks a keyboard connector, and it has a processor that\u2019s not as fast as the latest iPhones. It will not replace your laptop.\n\nThe biggest downside to the iPad is a limitation of iOS: it still doesn\u2019t support multiple user profiles, so handing it unlocked to your kid means handing them access to your email and any work apps you\u2019ve installed. But the iPad Pro has the same limitation, and competing tablets just can\u2019t match the iPad\u2019s fundamental quality or library of apps.\n\nPeople take the iPad for granted. That\u2019s fine. It means that it\u2019s reached a level of stability and accessibility that few other tech gadgets have. Don\u2019t overthink it: the iPad is the default for a reason. It\u2019s great.\n\nMoney is no object: iPad Pro\n\nWhile the iPad is the best tablet for most people, it is not the nicest or most impressive tablet. That would be the new iPad Pro. Apple released a new generation of the iPad Pro late in 2018, and it is a spare-no-expense device. It\u2019s been completely redesigned as a flat slate with Face ID and bezels so small that there\u2019s no room for a physical home button.\n\nBoth sizes (the 11-inch and 12.9-inch models) have big, beautiful screens with rounded corners and fast refresh rates. The iPad Pro\u2019s A12X processor is so fast that it outpaces most consumer-grade laptops at everyday tasks. You can attach a keyboard to it, magnetically snap and charge the new Apple Pencil with it, and generally walk around knowing you have just about the most advanced piece of tech Apple has ever made.\n\nBut all of this comes at a price: the base 64GB 11-inch model is more than twice as expensive as the entry-level iPad, plus add-on prices for the keyboard and stylus. You could, if you really wanted to, spend over $2,000 on a kitted-out iPad Pro setup. Even if you just get the basic model, though, you\u2019ll have a computer that\u2019s more powerful than anything even remotely close to its thin size and minimal weight.\n\nThe theoretical benefit of spending that much is that the iPad Pro could be your only computer. But as Nilay Patel explains in his review, going iPad-only involves too many computing contortions for most people. You can do it, but it\u2019ll be a hassle. The aforementioned multiuser limitation still applies here, for example. And though the iPad Pro has a standard USB-C port for charging and peripherals, it doesn\u2019t work in a standard way with things like USB drives. There\u2019s also no standard 3.5mm headphone jack, something that you might have accepted on your phone but might annoy you on a tablet you keep around the house.\n\nInstead, the better reason to step up to the iPad Pro is to get the nicest thing that will also be more future-proofed than the regular iPad.\n\nThe Others\n\nThe rest of the tablet world is in a weird spot. Although there are still a few out there, Android tablets are quickly becoming a dying breed, and they aren\u2019t likely to be well-supported going forward. The supposed replacement, Chrome OS tablets, are nowhere near ready for daily use yet. Microsoft, of course, has been pushing the Surface Pro (and, more recently, Surface Go) line for a long time. But even Microsoft has shied away from calling those devices \u201ctablets\u201d lately \u2014 probably because Windows is still much better as a laptop OS than as a tablet OS.\n\nOne set of tablets that might be worth a second look is Amazon\u2019s Fire tablets. They\u2019re based on a variant of Android, sure, but you should think of them as cheap, knock-around Amazon Prime machines. They could be good for kids or as an inexpensive living room tablet if you\u2019re watching your budget.\n\nOur review of Amazon Fire HD 10 Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff It\u2019s cheap\n\nGreat screen\n\nCapable performance Bad Stuff Plasticky as all get-out\n\nWeak app selection\n\nAlexa is strangely limited Buy for $149.99 from Amazon Buy for $149.99 from Best Buy\n\nOur review of Microsoft Surface Go Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Ultra portable\n\nGreat keyboard\n\nGood battery life Bad Stuff Big bezels mean screen is cramped\n\nDongles\n\nUpgraded model is pricey Buy for $549.00 from Microsoft Buy for $549.00 from Amazon\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Gorgeous screen\n\nExcellent battery life\n\nDeX is great for multitasking Bad Stuff Android apps for tablets are still mediocre\n\nRequires you to buy keyboard / mouse for DeX to be useful\n\nFace / iris scanning is hit or miss Buy for $649.00 from Samsung Buy for $649.00 from Amazon", "description": "Whether you\u2019re looking at a new iPad, the latest Android tablets, or even considering a Windows tablet, we\u2019ve tested them all and found the best tablet for the most people.", "authors": ["Dieter Bohn", "Jan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHcxdiYOHgBBsnHFoTi68TLqrOQ=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10584195/vpavic_180330_2434_0022_02.jpg", "published_at": "2017-08-11"}
