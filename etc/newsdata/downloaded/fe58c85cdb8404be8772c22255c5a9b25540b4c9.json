And while they can do those tasks better than humans, they're a long way off being able to control a body.\n\n\"Current state-of-the-art systems would not even be able to succeed in controlling the body of a mouse,\" says Prof Bengio, who cofounded the Canadian AI research company Element AI.\n\nToday's AI agents struggle to excel at more than one task, which is why they're often referred to as \"narrow AI\" systems as opposed to \"general AI\".\n\nImage copyright University of Cambridge Image caption Neil Lawrence, a machine learning professor at the University of Cambridge, thinks we should reconsider what we call AI\n\nBut it would be more appropriate to call a lot of today's AI technology \"computers and statistics\", according to Neil Lawrence, who recently left Amazon and joined the University of Cambridge as the first DeepMind professor of machine learning.\n\n\"Most of what we're calling AI is really using large computational capabilities combined with a lot of data, to unpick statistical correlations,\" he says.\n\nIndividuals such as Elon Musk have done a good job of scaring some into thinking Terminator could become a reality in the not so distant future, thanks in part to phrases such as AI is \"potentially more dangerous than nukes\".\n\nBut the AI community is unsure how quickly machine intelligence will advance during the next five years, let alone the next 10 to 30 years.\n\nThere's also scepticism in the community about whether AI systems will ever achieve the same level of intelligence as humans, or indeed whether this would be desirable.\n\n\"Typically, when people talk about the risks of AI, they have in mind scenarios whereby machines have achieved 'artificial general intelligence' and have the cognitive abilities to act beyond the control and specification of their human creators,\" Dr Grefenstette says.\n\n\"With all due respect to people who talk of the dangers of AGI and its imminence, this is an unrealistic prospect, given that recent progress in AI still invariably focuses on the development of very specific skills within controlled domains.\"\n\nImage copyright Kerry Brown\n\nWe should be more concerned with how humans abuse the power AI offers, Prof Bengio says.\n\nHow will AI further enhance inequality? How will AI be used in surveillance? How will AI be used in warfare?\n\nThe idea of relatively dumb AI systems controlling rampant killing machines is terrifying.\n\nProf Lawrence says: \"The film may make people think about what future wars will look like.\"\n\nAnd Prof Bryson says: \"It is good to get people thinking about the problems of autonomous weapons systems.\"\n\nBut we don't need to look into the future to see AI doing damage. Facial-recognition systems are being used to track and oppress Uighurs in China, bots are being used to manipulate elections, and \"deepfake\" videos are already out there.\n\n\"AI is already helping us destroy our democracies and corrupt our economies and the rule of law,\" according to Joanna Bryson, who leads the Bath Intelligent Systems group, at the University of Bath.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThankfully, many of today's AI researchers are working hard to ensure their systems have a positive impact on people and society, focusing their efforts on areas such as healthcare and climate change.\n\nOver at Facebook, for example, researchers are trying to work out how to train artificial systems that understand our language, follow instructions, and communicate with us or other systems.\n\n\"Our primary goal is to produce artificial intelligence that is more cooperative, communicative, and transparent about its intentions and plans while helping people in real-world scenarios,\" Dr Grefenstette says.\n\nImage copyright University of Bath Image caption Joanna Bryson is to become the professor of ethics and technology at Berlin's Hertie School of Governance in February\n\nUltimately, the responsibility of communicating the true state of AI lies with the media.\n\nThe choice of a photo directly affects interest in an article but journalism schools around the world would strongly advise against misleading the public for the sake of clicks.\n\nUnfortunately, there have been numerous instances of outlets using stills from the Terminator films in stories about relatively incremental breakthroughs.\n\nProf Bryson says she skips over them like adverts, while Prof Lawrence says he assumes they're clickbait.\n\nJournalists writing AI stories \"should show the cubicles of the people actually developing the AI\", at Google or Facebook, for example, Prof Bryson says.\n\n\"The press needs to stop treating AI like some kind of unearthed scientific discovery dug out of the ground or found on Mars,\" she says. \"AI is just a technology that people use to do things.\"\n\nAnd she makes a fair point. But be honest, would you have clicked on this story if it didn't have a killer robot photo?", "description": "There are genuine risks associated with AI - but the Terminator scenario isn't one of them.", "authors": ["Sam Shead", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/139BC/production/_109361308_terminator.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
