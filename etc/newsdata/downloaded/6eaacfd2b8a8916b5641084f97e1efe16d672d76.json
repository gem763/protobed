Arsenal winter transfer targets 1/10 Arsenal winter transfer targets Josh Kroenke has promised Arsenal plan to be \u2018proactive\u2019 in the winter transfer market. But who could they sign? Getty 2/10 Wilfried Zaha Arsenal have not completely given up on prizing Wilfried Zaha away from Crystal Palace. He won't come cheap ... but for the right price Palace may be tempted to cash in, particularly if the 26-year-old fails to impress in the first half of the season. Getty Images 3/10 Eduardo Camavinga The 16-year-old - who enjoyed a breakthrough performance against PSG in Ligue 1 last weekend - is also a target for Manchester United, City and Tottenham. Arsenal could attempt to replicate their William Saliba deal with Saint-\u00c9tienne by signing Camavinga and then immediately loaning him back to current club, Rennes. AFP/Getty Images 4/10 Dayot Upamecano If Josh Kroenke is true to his word, and his family do back the club in the winter market, than 20-year-old defender Dayot Upamecano is surely the first player they will attempt to sign. Arsenal came close to landing him this summer, only to balk at Leipzig's \u00a355m price tag having so recently spent a club-record \u00a372m on Nicolas Pepe. Bongarts/Getty Images 5/10 Samuel Umtiti Arsenal will monitor the first half of the 25-year-old's season at Barcelona very closely. The defender's 2018/19 season was hampered by injury and Unai Emery has gone on record about how much he rates the World Cup winner. Icon Sport via Getty Images 6/10 Daniele Rugani Juventus are desperate to get rid of the defender as they scramble to balance the books ahead of this week's Italian transfer deadline. If they fail to offload Rugani he will certainly be available in the winter, and could make a good cut-price solution if Arsenal do indeed manage to sell Shkodran Mustafi this month. AFP/Getty Images 7/10 Robert Arboleda Arsenal came very close to signing the Ecuador international Robert Arboleda from S\u00e3o Paulo on transfer deadline day, instead snapping up David Luiz. But if they are short in defence in five months time, the 27-year-old would make a sensible purchase, especially considering his club were willing to sell.

Getty Images\n\nBut Sokratis, signed from Borussia Dortmund last summer, said the buck stopped with him following his costly error.\n\n\u201cI think that I cost the game for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my mistake for something simple that I don\u2019t have to do. I think this was the problem why we lose the three points.\n\n\u201cThis is all about our responsibility and we have to do better. It was my mistake and today without my mistake, we would take the three points.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak about others. Today it was my mistake and this cost the game. Nothing else. The other guys tried their best. I don\u2019t have to do this mistake.\u201d\n\nWatford had 31 shots on goal during the game as they dominated after the interval, with Sokratis admitting Arsenal were not up to scratch in the second 45 minutes.\n\n\u201cOf course. I apologised because today I cost the game for the team and I have to work harder,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI know up to this moment I didn\u2019t have a mistake, I didn\u2019t do nothing. Everything was near to perfect. We didn\u2019t have the same pace in the second half as in the first half.\n\n\u201cBut if we didn\u2019t do these mistakes, I don\u2019t think we draw. Of course they had other chances to score more, but if we didn\u2019t do these mistakes then nothing happens.\u201d\n\nDespite their rousing comeback, Watford remain bottom of the Premier League and without a win following a poor start to the campaign that led to Javi Gracia losing his job last weekend.\n\nThe Spaniard was replaced almost immediately by compatriot Flores, who had previously taken charge of Watford for the 2015/16 season, and the 54-year-old will be encouraged by what he saw.\n\nCleverley revealed they had spent the days leading up to the game working on a way to close down Arsenal as they played out from the back \u2013 something that paid dividends as the former Manchester United midfielder grabbed his first league goal since January.\n\n\u201cI feel like we were well organised from their goal-kicks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is something we worked on all week. We weren\u2019t surprised they tried to play like that. It was just more of a surprise they didn\u2019t adapt during the game and they were pretty stubborn with it.\n\n\u201cIt was our kickstart to a comeback that was nearly perfect. We can be proud of the second half performance but we really need to be starting to turn those games into wins.\u201d\n\nAsked about the impact Flores has made since returning to Vicarage Road, Cleverley added: \u201cHe\u2019s not bombarded us with information.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just got his ideas across, very black and white about the basics of how he wants to set up and play. It has been a good, positive week.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Arsenal defender\u00a0Sokratis\u00a0Papastathopoulos insists he is solely responsible for allowing Watford\u00a0to come from two goals down and earn a draw against the Gunners on Sunday.
