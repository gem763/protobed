The employee said it was \"not a problem\" if the items were packed in a suitcase and were not disclosed to customs agents, the report said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the New Bedford Whaling Museum did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nIn 2015, an investigative report by The Boston Globe found that illegal operators in Massachusetts were participating in \"brisk trade\" of illicit ivory.\n\nThe state currently does not have a law in place prohibiting the intrastate trading of ivory or rhino horn, but the Massachusetts State House will hear public testimony on Tuesday regarding legislation that would implement a ban: Senate Bill 496 and House Bill 772, filed by Sen.

Lori Ehrlich.\n\nAs Massachusetts considers an ivory trade ban, we, along with @HSIGlobal, uncovered a thriving market for ivory in the state in our recent investigation.\n\n\n\nRead more #OnTheBlog with @HSUSKittyBlock: https://t.co/tEFT44uvfi pic.twitter.com/psk5kBStHd \u2014 The Humane Society of the United States (@HumaneSociety) September 9, 2019\n\nTen states, including New York, New Jersey, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, New Hampshire, Illinois and Minnesota have implemented similar laws in recent years.\n\n\"The trade in ivory contributes greatly to a devastating decline in elephant populations,\" said Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, in a statement. \"I am deeply saddened that ivory sales are occurring right here in my home state of Massachusetts, and that the New Bedford Whaling Museum would host an event where ivory is being sold at all\u2014particularly without apparent authentication that is required by our federal government.\"\n\nBetween 2010 and 2012, 100,000 elephants were killed for their ivory, according to Ivory Free Massachusetts.\n\nThe U.S. is among the largest markets for illegal wildlife goods in the world, according to the Humane Society.

Ivory can only be sold out of state if it's more than 100 years old or is part of a manufactured product, such as a musical instrument, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. However, the ban does not affect commerce within states.\n\nIn July, the Humane Society announced the findings of a \"lucrative\" ivory trade in Washington, D.C., where \"ivory dealers take advantage of the lack of local laws banning the sale of ivory.\"\n\nLegislation has been introduced in the Council of the District of Columbia that would prohibit sales of certain ivory products and products made from rhino horn, according to the organization.", "description": "An undercover investigation by animal welfare activists found that the sale of undocumented elephant ivory is still", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/elephant-stock-gty-jef-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
