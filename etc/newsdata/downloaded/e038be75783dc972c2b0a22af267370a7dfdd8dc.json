And those who do have debt tend to have modest burdens relative to their income. https://t.co/MHkgJ3Qzip via @BethAkers_ \u2014 Manhattan Institute (@ManhattanInst) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cThe typical graduate will have borrowed $28,500 in pursuit of a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d the report continues. \u201cThat can be repaid with monthly payments of $181 on a standard, 20-year repayment plan.\u201d\n\nSecondly, only 6 percent of student borrowers have more than $100,000 in debt. Most of these borrowers have graduate or professional degrees and often come from families with higher income.\n\n\u201cMore than one-third of outstanding student debt is held by individuals who are themselves in the highest income quartile,\u201d with individual income greater than $97,000, the report observes. \u201cTypically, those in trouble are not the ones with high debt but those who never completed college \u2013 default rates are highest for those with less than $5,000 in debt.\u201d\n\nThirdly, the report notes the mean income for all millennials \u2013 including those without college degrees \u2013 is $46,092:\n\nUnder the existing income-driven repayment programs for all federal student loans \u2026 borrowers with this level of income would never be required to pay more than $173 per month (4.5% of pretax income), regardless of how much they had borrowed.\n\n\u201cThe typical millennial has no student debt,\u201d Akers writes. \u201cEven among those who pursued higher education and borrowed to fund it, a typical household with two college-educated workers has more than $100,000 in annual income and pays less than $400 monthly on their loans.\u201d\n\nInstead of loan forgiveness, Akers recommends that federal intervention \u201cfocus on the small subset of borrowers with unmanageable debt burdens and ensure that they still repay what they can afford. Those programs already exist.\u201d\n\nThe report is released as Democrats plan to reauthorize the Higher Education Act with provisions that would allow for massive \u201cstealth\u201d student loan forgiveness, as Preston Cooper wrote at Forbes.\n\nContinuing along the path of the Obama administration, which ultimately allowed more student loans to be \u201cforgiven,\u201d the Democrats\u2019 plan contains a proposal that changes how loan payments for student borrowers are calculated based on income. Cooper observes:\n\nCurrently, borrowers in these plans pay an amount equal to 10% of their income above 150% of the poverty line (about $25,000 for a household of two). House Democrats would raise that threshold to 250% of the poverty line, slashing monthly payments for some borrowers and eliminating them for others.\n\nAs it stands now, student debt after 20 years of repayment is \u201cforgiven.\u201d Raising the threshold of the poverty line, however, means American taxpayers will be stuck with billions in student loan \u201cforgiveness.\u201d\n\nIn October 2018, Jason Delisle and Cody Christensen wrote at National Review the Democrats\u2019 plan \u201cwould let borrowers out of loans they could afford to pay back.\u201d\n\nThey explain that a typical student borrower has an income of about $35,000 and, currently, would pay $140 per month in loan repayment, with \u201cforgiveness\u201d after 20 years of repayment. An increase in the income exemption to 250 percent of the poverty line, however, \u201cmeans the borrower\u2019s initial payments would be just $39.\u201d\n\nWhile payments would grow as the borrower\u2019s income increases, under the Democrats\u2019 plan payments \u201cwould still be so low that they would barely cover the interest on the $30,000 loan,\u201d the authors noted. \u201cThat would mean all of the original principal balance would have to be forgiven after 20 years of payments.\u201d\n\nMany Democrat presidential hopefuls claim college graduates are crushed by student debt that prevents them from getting ahead and stimulating the economy.\n\nBoth 2020 candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have plans to cancel student debt.\n\nSanders\u2019 proposal would eliminate all existing student loan debt in the country. His campaign website states, if elected, he will \u201ccancel the entire $1.6 trillion in outstanding student debt for the 45 million borrowers who are weighed down by the crushing burden of student debt.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s plan contains caps, but would still cancel $1.25 trillion in student debt for 42 million people. Her proposal would forgive $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with a household income of $100,000. Those whose households make between $100,000 and $250,000 would have a portion of their student debt forgiven.\n\nIn August, the Wall Street Journal editorial board minced no words in asserting American taxpayers are victims of a student loan \u201cscam.\u201d The board noted the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s quarterly household debt survey released the week before showed more Americans are defaulting on their student loans.\n\nThe editors observed delinquent student loans have risen dramatically since 2012, when Barack Obama was president, and have overtaken delinquencies in credit card payments, auto loans, and mortgages.\n\nDuring the Obama era, they noted, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \u201cscored student loans as a government profit center by underestimating the growth in income-based repayment plans.\u201d\n\nNow, however, CBO predicts taxpayers will be on the hook for $306.7 billion over the next ten years.\n\nOf course, with the influx of taxpayer funds to pick up the tab, the WSJ board points out income-based repayment plans \u201chave also encouraged schools to raise prices and enroll students who probably won\u2019t earn enough to pay off their loans,\u201d knowing those students ultimately will be \u201cforgiven\u201d by taxpayers.\n\nAs it happens, \u201cAmericans who borrow more than they can repay typically default first on student loans,\u201d the editors say. But, while defaults on mortgages and car loans have serious consequences, individuals who default on student loans \u201care encouraged to enroll in income-based repayment plans.\u201d\n\nThe editorial board warns of substantial losses for American taxpayers due to the Obama-era repayment scheme that current Democrats plan to take to new heights.\n\n\u201cAll of this is worth keeping in mind as Democrats promise to save taxpayers billions by taking over other private industries and expanding the cradle-to-grave entitlement state,\u201d the board says.", "description": "A Manhattan Institute report states most millennials are not \u201cdrowning\u201d in student debt; 66 percent of them have none at all.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/student-graduation-day-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
