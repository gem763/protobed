Frazis is, in effect, the third CEO in a year considering Jon Sutton left in December last year and the interim CEO Anthony Rose left in September.\n\nThe lengthy period between Sutton\u2019s departure and the loss of about six members of the executive committee running the bank who have left would have contributed to the poor performance.\n\nThe board has five high-level priorities: return to profitable and sustainable growth, embed a purpose-led customer culture, simplify the business, close the digital gap with rivals and strengthen the bank through strong governance, compliance and prudent risk management.\n\nOutside help\n\nFrazis, a former Boston Consulting Group (BCG) consultant, has called in BCG to help him with a \u201cstructural productivity and operating model review\u201d. But Frazis says the review of BoQ\u2019s operating model will be driven the bank\u2019s executives and not the external consultants.\n\nAllaway says BoQ needs to reduce its cost to income ratio, which had blown out from about 45 per cent to 50 per cent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of difficult decisions that have to be made strategically and the ownership of that has to be with the senior executive team, myself and the board,\u201d he says. Allaway revealed BoQ has also sought advice from McKinsey & Co.\n\nFrazis says his transformation will be heavily reliant on the input of BoQ\u2019s new chief financial officer and chief operating officer, Ewen Stafford, who was involved in the business transformation at Australia Post and deputy CFO at Telstra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrazis and Stafford worked together at National Australia Bank. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of time for Ewen \u2013 he\u2019s got high integrity, a really nice style about him and a deep expertise on the finance, banking and transformation side,\u201d he says.\n\nAllaway, who is a director of Nine, which owns The Australian Financial Review, says Frazis is the ideal person to lead the BoQ turnaround because he is a consummate banker with a proven capability in transformation at other places including Westpac.\n\nAllaway and Frazis were reluctant to reveal the performance milestones for the new strategy. But Allaway says the bank needed to reduce its cost to income ratio, which had blown out from about 45 per cent to 50 per cent over the past few years.\n\nFrazis says he will come back to the market with a fully developed strategy in February.\n\nWhen the turnaround is complete, BoQ\u2019s range of products will have been simplified, its niche lending to professionals will have been expanded beyond the medical profession, it will have a much higher market share in small business lending, it will be competitive in home loans and have an expanded network of highly motivated branch franchise owners.", "description": "After many years of underperformance, Bank of Queensland is promising a turnaround in its fortunes by 2021 under the leadership of George Frazis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2623%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_330%2C$y_44/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/357e17a9b87ffdd50c8ec12a8c8d32f4665a4986", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
