But it galvanized President Trump\u2019s allies and made Mr. Patel a hero among them. After Republicans ceded control of Congress this year, he landed on Mr. Trump\u2019s National Security Council staff.\n\nColleagues there initially questioned the role of Mr. Patel, who took few notes in meetings and had little expertise for his initial portfolio, which covered the United Nations. Within months, senior White House officials began to suspect he had won Mr. Trump\u2019s ear and had effectively created a back channel to the president that could warp American policy, according to congressional testimony and interviews.\n\nColleagues grew alarmed after hearing that Mr. Trump had referred to Mr. Patel as one of his top Ukraine policy specialists and that the president wanted to discuss related documents with him, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Patel sought to discuss allegations of surveillance abuses by law enforcement officials with Mr. Trump, an administration official said. Mr. Patel, who is known as Kash, is now assigned to work on counterterrorism issues , not Ukraine.", "description": "Senior national security officials grew concerned about Kash Patel, a colleague who had been involved in Republicans\u2019 efforts to undermine the Russia investigation.", "authors": ["Julian E.
