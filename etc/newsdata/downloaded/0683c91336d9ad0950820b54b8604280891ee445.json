In fact, a lot of the more popular Android apps have been optimized for Chrome OS, so they will look perfectly at home on your Chromebook.\n\nGoogle has a long list of the Chromebooks that can run Android apps, but it\u2019s not difficult to check to see if yours is one of them by doing the following:\n\nGo to Settings\n\nClick on the \u201cApps\u201d link on the left-hand menu\n\nIn the main window, look for \u201cGoogle Play Store.\u201d (It should be near the top.) If it\u2019s there and it invites you to \u201cInstall apps and games from Google Play on your Chromebook,\u201d then you\u2019re ready to go.\n\nIt is possible that your Chromebook is capable of running Android apps, but the feature has not yet been enabled. Not a problem \u2014 it\u2019s very simple to fix.\n\nAs before, go to \u201cSettings\u201d > \u201cApps\u201d > \u201cGoogle Play Store\u201d (if you\u2019re not there already). You will see a button to the right of the \u201cGoogle Play Store\u201d label that says \u201cTurn on.\u201d Click on that.\n\nBefore you can do anything, you\u2019ll get the usual terms of service document that you must scroll through and approve. Read it if you like, then approve it.\n\nThat\u2019s it! Now all you have to do is look for the familiar Play Store logo in your Launcher, either by clicking on the Launcher icon in the lower-left corner of the screen or using the Launcher button on your keyboard just above the left Shift key. That will take you to the Play Store where you can search for and install your favorite Android apps on your Chromebook.\n\nAndroid apps you\u2019ve installed will also appear on the Launcher, just like any other Chrome OS app. For example, when I installed the Spotify Android app on a PixelBook, the Spotify icon appeared in the Launcher alongside all the previous apps.\n\nNote: The first time you go to the Google Play Store, you may get a pop-up that asks you to \u201cComplete account setup\u201d by adding a payment option. Don\u2019t panic. If you don\u2019t want to add any kind of payment info, you don\u2019t have to. Just hit \u201cSkip.\u201d\n\nYou can even select many of the same options for the Android apps that you would if they were on your phone. Click on \u201cManage Android preferences\u201d (which is just above the \u201cGoogle Play Store\u201d link you were at before) to choose whether you want notifications, if Do Not Disturb should be activated, etc.\n\nOne warning: Android apps that have been optimized for use on a Chromebook \u2014 which means many of the most popular apps \u2014 will look and act like normal Chromebook apps. However, apps that have not been optimized will basically appear in a phone screen format, so they won\u2019t be quite as usable \u2014 although they should, with possibly a few exceptions, still work.", "description": "Many Android apps have been optimized for the Chrome OS, so they will look perfectly at home on your Chromebook.", "authors": ["Barbara Krasnoff", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Us66O9aEPa1wwlLUawv2dQSd4DM=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12076467/VRG_TMN_020_Chromebook_Update_Still.0.0.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
