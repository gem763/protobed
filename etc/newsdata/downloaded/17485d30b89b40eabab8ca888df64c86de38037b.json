This figure increases if the average is based on the number of closed cases, reaching \u00a3532 for sales and \u00a3625 for lettings.\n\nWhile not be sniffed at, a few hundred quid is perhaps not the redress that many consumers are hoping for if they feel they had lost out on thousands of pounds due to what they felt was a error by their estate or lettings agent.\n\nAnd the time spent sending dozens of emails back and forth and filling out complaint forms mean that it could be less than worth your while financially raising the issue with the Property Ombudsman.\n\nSo why should you?\n\nThe Property Ombudsman said \u00a31.3million was paid out in money lost by consumers last year\n\nWith 90 officers and 50 adjudicators at the Property Ombudsman, Mrs Sporle claims it applies what is 'fair and reasonable' and 'puts consumers back to where they were before they lost out, plus compensation'.\n\n'We aim for an early resolution,' she insists.\n\nOfficial figures show four awards of more than \u00a39,999 against estate agents last year and nine against letting agents.\n\nIn addition there were five awards of between \u00a34,999 and \u00a39,999 on the sales side and 21 on the lettings side last year.\n\nThe Property Ombudsman received 23,841 enquiries in 2017. However, it could be argued that there is a flaw.\n\nThe Property Ombudsman is funded through fees from its members - the very people that consumers are complaining about: lettings and estate agents.\n\nHowever, Mrs Sporle insisted decisions are always independent.\n\nShe said: 'The Property Ombudsman Service provides fair, free and independent advice to protect consumers against poor behaviour from agents and to put things right when things go wrong.\n\n'We were set up 27 years ago when it was recognised that consumers needed a place to go when they had exhausted an organisation's internal complaint's process, but wanted an alternative to avoid the expense and time taken by going to court.'\n\nShe added: 'We are funded by the industry but our decision making is absolutely independent and we always base our decision on the evidence that is provided to us by both parties.\n\n'Our role is much broader than only putting things right when things go wrong; more importantly we work closely with the industry to raise standards to try and avoid the problems arising for consumers in the first place.'", "description": "The Property Ombudsman acts on behalf of consumers and can win back money they've lost during a dispute with their estate agent, but is it worth using?
