But if the match is cancelled they will be going home.\n\nOfficials are not expected to make a final decision on that match until Sunday morning, after they have assessed potential damage to the venue and transport links.\n\n\u2013 Officials on alert \u2013\n\nJapanese officials said they were on alert, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordering officials to \u201ctake every possible measure to ensure people\u2019s safety\u201d, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters.\n\nThe storm is expected to cause transport chaos over a holiday weekend in Japan, with many forced to cancel travel plans.\n\nJapan\u2019s two main airlines, All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines, cancelled hundreds of domestic flights.\n\nAnd the operator of the main bullet train service linking Tokyo and western cities said it would suspend all services between the capital and Nagoya on Saturday.\n\nA major overground train company in the capital also said it would gradually halt operations from early morning and other cancellations were expected.\n\nJapan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.\n\nHagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after another powerful storm, Typhoon Faxai, hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba, east of the capital.\n\nMore than 36,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Chiba, and the local government has urged those in damaged buildings to take shelter elsewhere during the storm.\n\nLocal officials equipped with satellite phones will be dispatched across the region to ensure communities can seek help during and after the storm.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Japan braced on Friday for a powerful typhoon barrelling towards Tokyo that has already forced the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/1328f6_typhoon-hagibis-has-weakened-but-packing-dangerous-punch-japan-braces-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
