I want to use my position to get men in the UK and around Europe thinking about, and taking seriously, the position of women in every country and in all parts of society.\n\nPart of our Liberal Democrat opposition to Brexit is driven by a strong desire to keep the United Kingdom together. Yet on gender equality, our country is already disunited.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The DUP \u2013 allegedly determined to ensure that Great Britain and Northern Ireland keep common customs arrangements \u2013 is quite happy to see a divergence in women\u2019s rights.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Parts of the United States are taking several regressive steps on reproductive rights. Meanwhile, El Salvador forbids abortion in all circumstances, even when a woman has been raped. Medical professionals are required to report any suspicions that a miscarriage or birth has been induced. This leaves women going through the tragedy of miscarriage susceptible to police interrogation, criminal prosecution and imprisonment.\n\nThe unjust nature of the law has been exposed in the case of Evelyn Hern\u00e1ndez, whom the El Salvadoran Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office chose to pursue. Evelyn was 18 years old when she was raped by a gang member. She miscarried at home due to an obstetrics complication. When she regained consciousness at the hospital she was arrested and later sentenced to 30 years in jail for aggravated homicide. Despite a higher court then declaring her innocent she remains imprisoned. Evelyn has repeatedly testified that she did not have enough knowledge to recognise the symptoms of her pregnancy and therefore to seek antenatal care. After the horror of rape, it is unimaginable to think she is then treated in this way by a justice system.\n\nCountries where abortion is prohibited do not have lower rates of abortion, merely higher rates of maternal mortality. Rigid laws in many countries have led to an increase in unregulated abortion pills on the black market. It is harrowing to think that amid the many medical advancements of the 21st century there are people that are forced to desperately seek toxic concoctions of fertilisers and dangerous herbs to induce life-threatening \u201cDIY\u201d abortions.\n\nRape and other forms of sexual violence are rife across the globe, and are used in conflict-ridden parts of the world as an appalling weapon against women, and in these regions many women face unimaginable pain and indignity for want of proper public information, safe healthcare and decent medical facilities.\n\nGrowing up in a Pakistani-Muslim family, I know that in many societies discussions about female anatomy and health are taboo. If any sexual health education is provided, it is centred around abstinence. Access to contraception is reserved for married couples. Such factors have resulted in loss of life and female pain.\n\nThe denial of medical services, including reproductive health services that only certain individuals need, is a form of discrimination. As policymakers around the world are disproportionately male, it is imperative we stand shoulder to shoulder with our female colleagues on this issue.\n\nThis is not a \"women\u2019s issue\" but is something our whole society must address. Gender equality cannot be achieved if only half of the population have autonomy over their bodies.\n\nShaffaq Mohammed is the Liberal Democrat MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber.
