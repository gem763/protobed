Democrats have vowed to protect the identity of the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d but Republicans question whether or not the person even meets the criteria of a whistleblower.\n\n\u201cThere is no whistleblower,\u201d Rep. Paul Gosar wrote on Twitter Wednesday. \u201cThere is a leaker who illegally released information. Calling a traitor a \u2018whistleblower\u2019 does not make it so.\u201d\n\nTrump continues challenging the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d claim of a \u201cquid-pro-quo\u201d case of the president withholding federal aid from Ukraine until they publicly announced an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s role in a Ukrainian energy company and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump also dismissed the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d accusation last week while speaking with reporters at the White House, noting Schiff no longer wanted him to testify in front of Congress.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, or was given false information, or it was even worse than that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, all of a sudden, Schiff doesn\u2019t want to talk to the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s the Whistleblower? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nRepublicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the House because of what the Do Nothing Democrats have done to our Country! \u2014 Donald J.
