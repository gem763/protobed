In the Midwest, the average household using propane spent $1,338.\n\nEIA will release its outlook, which will contain estimated household expenditures for the winter of 2019-2020 at noon EDT (1600 GMT) on Tuesday.\n\nNatural gas is the most common space heating fuel in 29 states and the District of Columbia. Electricity tends to be more common in southern states and heating oil is most prevalent in much of New England, EIA said.\n\nPropane is more common in the Midwest, but it is not the primary heating fuel in any state.\n\nEIA said its forecast of winter heating expenditures are based on weather, fuel price and consumption forecasts. One factor affecting prices is how much fuel there is in inventory.\n\nEIA said natural gas storage has seen a significant rebound over the past year. Inventories in the Lower 48 states began the injection season on April 1 almost 30% lower than the previous five-year average.\n\nBy the end of October, the end of the injection season, EIA said gas inventories will likely be 2% higher than the previous five-year average.\n\nEIA said it does not expect significant supply disruptions or price fluctuations in heating oil even though inventories in the Northeast were 26% lower than the previous five-year average at the end of September.\n\nEIA noted heating oil can be transported to the Northeast by pipeline, vessels from other U.S. ports and imports. In addition, EIA said refiners are likely to maximize production of distillates in coming months.", "description": "U.S. consumers will likely spend less to heat their homes this winter than last year due in part to forecasts for slightly warmer than normal temperatures, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
