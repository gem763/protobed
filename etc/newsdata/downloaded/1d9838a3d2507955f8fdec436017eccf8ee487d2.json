They\u2019re not performers in that way.\n\n\"Athletically they\u2019ve got the ability, but actually dancing, as we know from Anton Du Beke, is 90% from the neck up.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nLove Island winner Amber Gill burst out laughing, while TV presenter Gabby Roslyn looked mortified.\n\n\"Don\u2019t diss Anton in the slightest,\" warned stunned Gabby while wagging her finger. She added: \"Nothing negative.\"\n\nContinuing to dig a deeper hole, Rufus said: \"I love Anton but if you watch him dance you realise you\u2019re not looking really from there down.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe audience continued giggling while outraged Gabby started jokingly slapping Rufus' outstretched hand.\n\nAfter putting his hand over his mouth in shock, Rylan said: \"I can sense a fight breaking out. I\u2019m going to have to move on because I can\u2019t hear a bad word said about our Anton.\"\n\nGabby then stopped Rufus from blurting out any more insults by putting her hand over his mouth.\n\nDoing a mocking digging motion, Rylan added: \"Rufus, I\u2019m going to help you out here and get out of that hole.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIt Takes Two viewers took to Twitter to praise Rufus for his frank comments on the panel.\n\nOne fan said: \"Rufus Hound is amazingly good value on the Friday panel on #ItTakesTwo.\"\n\n\"Rufus Hound is always so spot on with his comments,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Rufus not afraid to tell it like it is. David James IS dull, doesn\u2019t take the criticism well & frankly lacks personality!\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHowever, others were annoyed at Rufus for speaking over the other celebrity superfans.\n\n\"Jesus why does Rufus Hound interrupt guests, go into rant mode and take over every show he's on, don't invite him onto,\" said one viewer.\n\nAnother added: \"Yeah I\u2019m a bit behind, but OMG, shut up, Rufus. They weren\u2019t asking you!\n\n\"Shut up already, Rufus,\" said a third.\n\n*Strictly - It Takes Two airs weeknights on BBC One at 5.15pm", "description": "The It Takes Two host had to step in after Rufus Hound and Gaby Roslin argued over his Anton Du Beke insult", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20461645.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rylan-stops-It-Takes-Two-fight-breaking-out-after-Rufus-Hound-mocks-Anton-Du-Beke.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
