However, you can't \u2014 at least, not without special equipment.\n\nWhile you can't directly pair Bluetooth headphones to a Nintendo Switch, there is a relatively easy way to work around the issue: a Bluetooth transmitter.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nHow to connect Bluetooth headphones to your Nintendo Switch\n\nThe solution is to convert the Switch's regular 3.5 mm headphone jack into a Bluetooth transmitter by using a special dongle.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch cannot pair with Bluetooth headphones without the use of a third-party transmitter \u2014 the small white box in this photo. Steven John/Business Insider\n\nYou can get a good Bluetooth transmitter on Amazon, and the dongle can convert any device with an audio jack into a Bluetooth-friendly system.\n\nJust plug the transmitter into the audio output jack on the top of the Nintendo Switch, and then pair it with your Bluetooth headphones.\n\nHere's an example of how to do so with the transmitter linked above:\n\n1. With the dongle inserted into the Switch, hold the pair button for several seconds to place it into pairing mode. Most will flash once in this mode.\n\n2. Now hold down the pair button on your headphones. When the light on the dongle becomes solid, you have successfully paired the devices.\n\nA small Bluetooth dongle allows Bluetooth-enabled earbuds or headphones to work with the Switch. Steven John/Business Insider\n\nBe sure to follow the pairing instructions included in your specific transmitter's manual.\n\nThe audio will now play just as it would through a pair of headphones connected by wire.\n\nOf course, an even easier solution here is to simply use headphones with a physical wire, and plug them into the 3.5 mm jack. But this option won't give you nearly as much flexibility.\n\nRelated coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech:", "description": "To connect Bluetooth headphones to your Nintendo Switch, you'll need to buy a Bluetooth transmitter, and pair it with your headphones.", "authors": ["Steven John"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da602df4af90972b717da04?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
