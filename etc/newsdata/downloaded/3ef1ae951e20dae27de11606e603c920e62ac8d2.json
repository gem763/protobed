That's a reference to White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Bolton had a tense encounter with Sondland on July 10 and instructed Hill to notify Eisenberg about Sondland's work with Giuliani and Mulvaney.\n\nBut the person familiar with Sondland's account said Tuesday that neither Bolton nor Hill raised any concerns directly with him.", "description": "Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, allegedly wanted to change his Brussels residence shortly after arriving in June last year, before requesting a long list of improvements.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/13/19837328-0-image-a-6_1571317104526.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
