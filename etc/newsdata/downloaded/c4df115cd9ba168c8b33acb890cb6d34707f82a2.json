While I don\u2019t feel that it can be attributed to an individual cause, I am certain that youth services have a significant role to play in helping young people who are choosing to carry knives or weapons and those who are contemplating it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201dYoung people need a place to go where they can belong, where they have the opportunity to come together with peers outside of school and develop their personal growth. If they fall into the wrong group, they are unfortunately likely to stay there.\n\n\u201cIn addition to youth centres, a lot of youth services used to focus on finding young people out on the streets and engaging with them in a way that their school or family were unable to. Sadly, there is no funding available for that anymore.\u201d\n\nCat Smith MP, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for youth affairs, said youth services and the youth work profession played an \u201cabsolutely vital role\u201d in equipping young people with the skills and confidence they need to fulfil their potential.\n\nShe added: \u201cOver the last decade this important public service has been decimated by Tory cuts, leaving many young people with nowhere to go, nothing to do, and no one to speak to outside of school and their home environment.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
