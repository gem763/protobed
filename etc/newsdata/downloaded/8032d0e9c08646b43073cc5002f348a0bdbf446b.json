He often said he would rather die than be arrested.\"\n\nAnother student urged the government to fulfil the five demands of the movement, which include an independent investigation into alleged police brutality.\n\n\"If you do not hear our voices now, we will ensure the new government that succeeds you will avenge every single atrocity you have committed against us,\" the student said.\n\n\"This means war.\"\n\nThe shooting has shocked residents of the leafy neighbourhood in the north of the city and exposed how young many of those on the front lines of the protests are.\n\nFormer Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying, in a letter to the school, demanded it expel Tsang and that the principal resign.\n\nThe student representatives said they had met the principal of the school who had promised the teenager would not be expelled but declined to take a stance on what they described as escalating police brutality.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELF-DEFENCE\n\nPolice have said the officer who fired the live shot was under serious threat and acted in self-defence in accordance with official guidelines.\n\nRepresentatives of the school could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\n\"We didn't get a good response from them,\" said Alan, a former student in his twenties, who said he was in the meeting with school authorities.\n\n\"They are trying to say something which is irrelevant to our questions: 'Violence is not correct. China is our mother even if she did something wrong'.\"\n\nAs the students spoke, dozens of primary schoolchildren shouted slogans of the pro-democracy movement: \"Revive Hong Kong\" and \"Revolution of our time\".\n\nBut later, the group and members of the media were pelted with eggs by residents as a drone hovered overhead.\n\nOther residents said they supported the students, despite the violence.\n\n\"I am heart-broken,\" said Cheung, 30, a mother of young children.\n\n\"The kids are just expressing their demands. Even if they take out a stick they are just trying to protect themselves, they are not aiming to hurt anyone. But the police is trying to take his life away.\"\n\nStanding outside the school gates, two former students, also masked, said many of those actively involved in the protests were teenagers, and some as young as 12.\n\nOne of Tsang's classmates, 17-year-old Cheung, said they would not be deterred by the shooting.\n\n\"Our generation is fighting for the next generation's future, so we are forced to risk our lives to fight for Hong Kong,\" he said.
