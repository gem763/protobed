The ADL said an image of the hairstyle \u201cworn by white supremacist mass killer Dylann Roof,\u201d who shot and killed nine black parishioners, has become popular with white supremacists.\n\n\u201cThose who use the bowlcut image or other \u2018bowl\u2019 references admire Roof and call for others to emulate his 2015 mass shooting attack at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina,\u201d said the ADL in its press release.\n\nMany of the symbols and slogans included on the hate list are obviously offensive, such as \u201cburning Neo-Nazi symbols\u201d and an anti-Semitic drawing called the \u201cHappy Merchant,\u201d which shows a Jewish man with \u201cheavily stereotypical facial features\u201d rubbing his hands together.\n\nBut the addition of popular, seemingly innocuous symbols like the \u201cOK\u201d sign prompted pushback from those who described the ever-growing list of unacceptable images and phrases as an example of the outrage culture run amok.\n\nSocial-media mavens were quick to point out that \u201cOK\u201d is a safety signal used in scuba diving, and that even former President Barack Obama has placed his thumb and pointer finger together in public on numerous occasions.\n\n\u201cIf a handful of white nationalists use the OK hand sign to troll the media, who cares?\u201d asked the Federalist\u2019s David Marcus. \u201cAre we really going to give them the power to destroy a sign that has been used for hundreds of years and which is used presumably millions of times a day with no harmful intent?\u201d\n\nCritics noted that adding any symbol used by racists on sites like 4chan, 8chan and Reddit has no limiting principle, meaning that the list could easily grow to encompass any number of now-innocuous signs, like \u201cthumbs up\u201d or \u201chang 10.\u201d\n\n\u201cCeding common hand gestures like the \u2018ok\u2019 symbol to white supremacists sends its own message,\u201d said the Daily Wire\u2019s Ashe Schow. \u201cIt gives the racists the power to co-opt ordinary behaviors and allows the media and politicians to label innocent people as racists.\u201d\n\nReally? The OK sign is a \u201cHate Symbol.\u201d Get bent. pic.twitter.com/gPUaDfVv1P \u2014 C in Carolina - MAGA Baby! (@American_Talker) September 26, 2019\n\n\n\nUsing the \u201cOK\u201d symbol to signify racism began as a hoax on 4chan, but by 2019, \u201cthe symbol was being used in some circles as a sincere expression of white supremacy,\u201d according to the ADL.\n\n\u201cEven as extremists continue to use symbols that may be years or decades old, they regularly create new symbols, memes and slogans to express their hateful sentiments,\u201d said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, a former Obama special assistant. \u201cWe believe law enforcement and the public needs to be fully informed about the meaning of these images, which can serve as a first warning sign to the presence of haters in a community or school.\u201d\n\nAlso added to the list was the \u201cMoon Man,\u201d a crescent-moon-in-sunglasses image used by McDonald\u2019s in the 1980s to promote its late-night hours that has been \u201cappropriated by white supremacists, especially from the alt right, who attach it to racist songs, language and imagery,\u201d said the ADL.\n\nIn a disclaimer, the ADL said the symbols \u201cmust be evaluated in the context in which they appear. Few symbols represent just one idea or are used exclusively by one group.\u201d\n\nADL spokesman Jake Hyman said that \u201ccontext is key, so we are in no way suggesting that everyone who uses/wears these is guilty of promoting white supremacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the traditional meaning of the hand gesture, as well as other usages unrelated to white supremacy, particular care must be taken not to jump to conclusions about the intent behind someone who has used the gesture,\u201d Mr. Hyman said in an email.\n\nSuch conclusion-jumping has happened already. During the 2018 Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, former Kavanaugh law clerk Zina Bash was accused by some leftists of flashing an OK \u201cwhite power\u201d sign as she rested her hand on her arm, an interpretation described by her husband, U.S. Attorney John Bash, as \u201crepulsive.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that his wife is \u201cMexican on her mother\u2019s side and Jewish on her father\u2019s side. She was born in Mexico. Her grandparents were Holocaust survivors. We of course have nothing to do with hate groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idiocy of this is that people making the gesture in completely unrelated contexts can still be accused of being racists and have their lives ruined,\u201d said the Media Research Center\u2019s Alexander Hall.\n\nIndeed, most Americans are probably using symbols from the \u201cHate on Display\u201d list in their everyday lives without realizing it. Among the hate images are a bevy of numbers, including: 1-11, 100%, 9%, 12, 13, 14, 18, 28, 38, 43, 83, 88, 311, 318, 511 and 737.\n\nAnother symbol of hate: an anti-antifa image of the black-and-red anti-fascist flag with a line drawn through it, which may come as a surprise to critics of the left-wing protest group that has repeatedly come under fire for stoking violence.\n\n\u201c\u2018Anti-Antifa\u2019 images are white supremacist symbols and memes directed against antifa activists,\u201d the ADL said. \u201cAntifa (short for \u2018anti-fascist\u2019) are left-wing and anarchist activists who focus on directly confronting white supremacists.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sens. Ted Cruz and Bill Cassidy introduced a resolution in July calling for antifa to be labeled a domestic-terrorist group after masked, black-clad activists attacked Portland conservative journalist Andy Ngo, sending him to the hospital with a brain injury.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like communists and anarchists you\u2019re a white supremacist!\u201d\n\nThank you ADL very cool. pic.twitter.com/iuyUByVPZa \u2014 Randomletters (@Randoml23702065) September 26, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
