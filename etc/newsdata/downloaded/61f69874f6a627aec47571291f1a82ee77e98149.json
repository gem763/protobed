Asked about his jokes about liking math and knowing doctors, he has maintained that the Asian-American community is diverse, that his individual experience does not speak for everyone and that Americans are smart enough to see through the model minority myth, which overgeneralizes Asians as diligent and high-achieving.\n\nIn an interview on Monday with The New York Times just hours before Mr. Gillis was dropped from \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d Mr. Yang said he had not meant to compare his experience as an Asian-American to \u201cthe experience of growing up black in this country.\u201d He said he had intended only to make an \u201cobservation\u201d about anti-Asian racism and the fact that it is not always taken seriously.\n\nMr. Yang said he and his wife had sat down to watch Mr. Gillis\u2019s comedy routines for 30 minutes to an hour and had concluded that he was not \u201cmalignant or evil.\u201d He also said he had resisted sending a tweet containing an explicative that would have more forcefully expressed his anger at Mr. Gillis.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a complex set of reactions one has,\u201d Mr. Yang said.\n\nHe said that someone had yelled a slur at him out a car window \u201cjust the other day\u201d and added that he had talked to his wife about the experience. He said they had bemoaned the fact that such a slur could eventually be directed at one of their boys.\n\nMr. Yang also denied that there were any politics at play. \u201cThis is both how I genuinely see this and what I think is best,\u201d he said. \u201cI totally respect people who have different points of view.\u201d\n\nDanielle Seid , an assistant professor of English at Baruch College who studies film and television history, said Mr. Yang had definitely found himself \u201cin a tough spot.\u201d He had been right to point out that anti-Asian racism has often not been treated seriously, she said, but he may not have done \u201ca good job of parsing that with his tweets about the n-word.\u201d\n\nMr. Yang\u2019s comments could have been read as an argument that \u201cAsians have it worse\u201d than other minority groups, when \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear that, in terms of racist policies and practices and culture in the United States, so much of it is founded on anti-black racism,\u201d said, Ellen Wu , an associate professor of history at Indiana University.", "description": "Mr. Gillis was dropped by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d after calling Mr. Yang a racial slur, and Mr. Yang, an entrepreneur who is running for president, has urged forgiveness.", "authors": ["Matt Stevens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/arts/16snl-yang1/16snl-yang1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
