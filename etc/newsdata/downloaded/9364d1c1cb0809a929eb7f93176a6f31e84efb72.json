The story of a death", "language": "en", "text": "Rio\u2019s military police department said in an email to the BBC that four military officers who were in a patrol car had come under fire near the Carmen Cintra street by two armed men on two motorbikes. After a gunfight, they returned to the police station, unaware that people had been hit.\n\nBut investigating cases involving the police is not easy. Paulo Roberto Mello Cunha, a state prosecutor, leads a team that looks into allegations of police violence, but mostly there is not a lot it can do. \u201cYou have to count on the police to investigate the police,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t do forensics, for example.\u201d\n\nStates in Brazil have two separate police forces - the military force in charge of public order, and the civil force to carry out forensics and investigations.\n\nApart from the chronic lack of personnel and resources, Cunha\u2019s team often struggles with inadequate evidence from crime scenes that have not been preserved, sometimes intentionally.\n\nThere are frequent claims from relatives and activists of people being taken to hospital already dead in alleged attempts by officers to cover up possible wrongdoing, or even of guns and drugs being put next to victims\u2019 bodies as ways to incriminate them.\n\nI was told that residents and Jean Rodrigo\u2019s relatives had gathered next to his body to protect the area until the forensics team arrived. His family also quickly released his pay cheque from the federal government and his jiu-jitsu certificates, hoping it would demonstrate that he was a working man with no links with criminals.\n\nOften, fearful witnesses remain silent and prosecutors reject taking on investigations, aware that they could become targets. Cunha himself has been given bodyguards after he and his family received threats. \u201cWe rarely have a proper investigation,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes it works. Depending on the stars, it\u2019ll work. But that\u2019s not the rule.\u201d\n\nSince 2016, when his group was set up, they have investigated some 1,300 cases. Charges have been pressed in less than 5% of them. \u201cBefore, we had 0% of the cases, so I think we\u2019re building something,\u201d he says. \u201cThe bar is pretty low.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t backtrack,\u201d Witzel said in August, arguing his government was \u201cin the right way\u201d. Proof of this, he said, was the drop in homicides - there were 2,392 cases in the state between January and July, a drop of 23% from 2018. Violent thefts and robberies are also falling, while the police have seized large amounts of drugs and weapons.\n\nThe Red Command - Rio\u2019s largest drug gang, controlling a vast number of neighbourhoods - was even running out of ammunition, Witzel claimed. He also said that drug traffickers should be legally defined as terrorists, with harsher sentences. \u201cYou can\u2019t combat terrorism with flowers,\u201d he said last month. \u201cThe message has been sent: Don\u2019t fight the police.\u201d\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the improvements celebrated by Witzel are a direct result of his policies, experts say. The fall in the homicide rate, in particular, appears to follow a national trend - official numbers suggest 6,543 cases nationwide between January and February, a 20% drop on the same time last year.\n\nWhile Witzel has focused on drug traffickers, critics say he has downplayed the threat from violent paramilitary groups created by policemen, active and retired, known as mil\u00edcias. None of the deaths in police operations between January and June occurred in districts where they are active, according to UOL Not\u00edcias, a news website.\n\nWitzel\u2019s office did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\nOutside Rio\u2019s poorest districts, there is some support for Witzel\u2019s policies, as frightened residents despair of seeing an end to the violence. \u201cWe have to kill those boys,\u201d one resident of Barra da Tijuca, a fashionable seaside neighbourhood where President Bolsonaro has a private residence, tells me, referring to drug traffickers. When I say innocent people are also being killed, he replies: \u201cIt\u2019s the price!\u201d\n\nThe police were responsible for almost a third of all violent deaths - essentially any death that is not accidental or natural - in Rio de Janeiro between January and July, according to the state\u2019s Institute for Public Safety.\n\nParliamentarian Renata Souza says there is \u201cwidespread fear\u201d that extrajudicial executions are being carried out. \u201cThere are operations in which the killings are indiscriminate... These are massacres committed by the state.\u201d\n\nIn February, residents of Fallet-Fogueteiro in the centre of Rio said nine men were tortured and stabbed by officers in a house, killed even after they had surrendered. Police said the suspects had responded with gunfire when they arrived, and the residence reportedly had 182 bullet holes on it.\n\nLocals, however, said the police had surrounded the place and that there had been no gunfight. In total, 15 people were killed, the deadliest raid in Rio in 12 years. Witzel defended the operation as \u201clegitimate\u201d.\n\nIn May\u2019s operation with the helicopter in Mar\u00e9, police said they were looking for a suspected drug lord. Pictures of pupils fleeing a school as the police hovered overhead went viral. Eight people were killed in the raid, four of them in a single house.\n\nAgain, residents said the men had already surrendered when they were killed. A witness, whose house was broken into by the heavily armed suspected drug traffickers, told me on condition of anonymity: \u201cOne of [the suspects] said \u2018Perdi\u2019, \u2018I\u2019ve lost it.\u2019 The policeman said: \u2018You didn\u2019t only lose. My order is to kill.\u2019\u201d\n\nBoth cases are still being investigated by the police. But Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brasil, says authorities are allowing this \u201cviolent approach\u201d by officers.\n\n\u201cKilling people can\u2019t be considered public policy,\u201d Werneck, who was herself born in a favela, says. \u201cWe have the proper way to deal with [suspected criminals]. It has to be in front of justice and not in front of guns.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/extra/shorthand/assets/news/FI4UOEvq3F/assets/xmWXum59m8/053959828-1920x1080.jpeg"}
