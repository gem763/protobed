REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nThe UK has been a pivotal global shipping center for centuries, especially the City of London, and has dominated marine insurance, ship broking, shipping finance and other maritime services.\n\nThese contribute $5.6 billion a year to Britain\u2019s economy, providing employment for more than 10,000 people in highly skilled jobs, according to a report by consultancy PwC, commissioned by trade association Maritime London.\n\nBut a shift in global shipping trade to Asia and tougher competition are adding to pressures on this niche sector, the report said.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that if the UK had maintained its market share over the last two years, this would have resulted in an additional $700 million p.a. (annually) in GVA (gross value added) for the UK economy,\u201d said the report, published in partnership with the City of London Corporation.\n\nThe global maritime services market is estimated to be worth $20 billion annually.\n\n\u201cSignificant ground has been lost to international competitors in recent years. Competitors such as the U.S., China, Norway and particularly Singapore, are all challenging in key areas of development and we must react,\u201d said Harry Theochari, chair of the separate Maritime UK body.\n\nThe report, launched at the start of London International Shipping Week, comes as Britain spins toward an election. Brexit remains up in the air, more than three years after Britons voted to leave the European Union. Options range from a turbulent \u201cno-deal\u201d exit to abandoning the whole endeavor.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors said their interviews with maritime services professionals \u201coffered mixed views on the impact of Brexit on the UK\u2019s perception as a politically stable country\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome pointed to opportunities to reduce regulation post-Brexit, while others expressed concerns about the availability of talent and the perception of the UK as \u2018open for business\u2019,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe exodus from shipping finance by many leading lenders including Britain\u2019s Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Lloyds (LLOY.L) had affected London\u2019s position as a money destination for international shipping firms, the report said.\n\nSeparately, Britain\u2019s decision to scrap tax breaks for long-term residents who claim \u201cnon-domicile\u201d status led to the departure of prominent Greek players from London in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe UK needs to be more active in courting ship owners and other industry participants to come here,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cIt is also vital that post-Brexit, the UK remains open and welcoming to foreign talent.\u201d\n\nThe report said the UK maintained 25% of the maritime services market. It recommended more efforts to bring dual listings to the London Stock Exchange to boost capital markets activity for shipping as well as taking a lead in developing environmental finance products, while providing tax incentives.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s critical is that we work to strengthen the core of ship owners and charterers in the UK, which will provide a significant boost to the UK economy,\u201d Maritime UK\u2019s Theochari said.", "description": "Britain's position as a top hub for maritime services is being eroded by competition, a loss of shipping finance business and the removal of tycoon-friendly tax breaks, a report said, deepening uncertainty for its financial sector as Brexit nears.", "authors": ["Jonathan Saul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427741130&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8711M", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
