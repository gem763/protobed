(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nThe IG report confirms it.\n\nDonald Trump was always the target.\n\nThe point of the Russia investigation was to make a case against Donald Trump. Preferably, the case would drive him from office. At a minimum, it would render him unelectable by the 2020 stretch run. The kind of case was less important than the objective: criminal prosecution or impeachment. In accordance with the collusion narrative, the latter would mean trying to show that Trump was compromised by the Kremlin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is the astonishing takeaway from Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s report on former FBI director James Comey\u2019s handling of his memos.\n\nIn truth, it\u2019s not that astonishing. It happens to be the theory of my new book, Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency. Obviously, if a book can show that Donald Trump was in the FBI\u2019s crosshairs all along, that fact had to have been knowable for some time.\n\nStill, if you\u2019re going to write a book about a mind-blowing theory, it is gratifying to have that theory confirmed \u2014 notwithstanding how alarming it may be for the state of our republic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IG report confirms it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an offhanded confirmation. The burden of the IG report is not to break news about the true purpose of the Trump-Russia investigation. It is to assess former director Comey\u2019s conduct in generating, maintaining, and disseminating information in the memos he made about most of his interactions with President Trump. On that score, the IG report is scathing.\n\nI\u2019m going to put that to the side, along with the former director\u2019s regrettable decision to go Baghdad Bob on Twitter just as the report was released. There\u2019s already been enough misdirection.\n\nRegardless of why IG Horowitz came to address the objectives of the Russia investigation, address them he did. The upshot of that was nailed by Byron York in his Washington Examiner report.\n\nWhat we learn is that Comey and his top FBI advisers prepared extensively for the then-director\u2019s January 6, 2017, briefing of then-president-elect Trump. The detailed preparation owed to the fact that the FBI regarded the session at Trump Tower in New York not as a mere briefing but as an evidence-gathering opportunity. That\u2019s because they were investigating Trump, which they hoped to continue doing when he took office . . . which called for putting him at ease . . . which meant telling him that they were not investigating him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plan on January 6 (i.e., the day after director Comey met with President Obama about next steps in the Russia investigation) was for Comey to hit the president-elect with a Steele-dossier allegation: the salacious and unverified claim that Trump had cavorted with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel in 2013, and been covertly recorded doing so by Russian intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not a briefing. It is Criminal Investigations 101: Get the suspect talking so a comfort level is established, then zing him with something that will rock his world. Thus confronted, a suspect will often blurt out either an implicit admission of guilt or a false exculpatory statement. Either one is a home run for the investigator.\n\nAnd make no mistake: Comey was the investigator. The zing was elaborately planned, and so was the post-mortem. A bureau car equipped with a secure computer would be at the ready. While Trump\u2019s words were still ringing in Comey\u2019s ears, the then-director would begin typing out the then-president-elect\u2019s reaction to the ambush \u2014 his responsive statements, his reasoning if he had tried to justify himself, his demeanor.\n\nThe investigator wants to get all of that in his report. That way, the suspect is locked in. As a practical matter, once you have given a version of events, making up a new story when you are later charged and informed about the prosecution\u2019s evidence is not an option. Innocent people do not have multiple versions of events; they have one story: the truth. Only guilty people lie. That\u2019s why, for the investigator, a false exculpatory statement is as good as a true confession. That\u2019s why the ambush works so well.\n\nThere\u2019s a caveat, of course. The ambush strategy works well if the suspect is guilty. When a suspect makes exculpatory statements that the investigator cannot disprove, then the investigator has no case.\n\nWhen we look again at Comey\u2019s memo of that first meeting with President-elect Trump, we see how this played out: Comey\u2019s zinger, Trump\u2019s exculpatory responses. We find the highly experienced investigator elaborating on the operation of his suspect\u2019s mind:\n\nI said, the Russians allegedly had tapes involving him and prostitutes at the Presidential Suite at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow from about 2013. He interjected, \u201cthere were no prostitutes; there were never prostitutes.\u201d He then said something about him being the kind of guy who didn\u2019t need to \u201cgo there\u201d and laughed (which I understood to be communicating that he didn\u2019t need to pay for sex). He said \u201c2013\u201d to himself, as if trying to remember that period of time, but didn\u2019t add anything. He said he always assumed that hotel rooms he stayed in when he travels are wired in some way.\n\nIf you understand what Comey was doing, the memo is not very subtle. The implication is that the \u201cgolden showers\u201d incident may well have happened (meaning: Yes, Putin may have Trump over a barrel, just like Chris Steele says!). The president-elect was adamant only that prostitutes were not involved, not that an escapade of this kind was inconceivable. The then-director made sure to include Trump\u2019s thinking aloud about the year of the alleged incident, 2013. Translation: Most normal people would be able immediately to say, \u201cThis never happened\u201d; but for Trump, kinky exploits must be so routine that his first impulse was to sort out the time frame.\n\nThat is to say: If the FBI\u2019s investigation turned up some corroboration for Steele\u2019s pee-tape story, Comey would now be in a position to provide helpful testimony about Trump\u2019s statements and state of mind. The memo itself might even be admissible in court as evidence for the prosecution.\n\n\u201cRecollection recorded\u201d \u2014 remember that one? That was the tell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 2017, when the existence of former director Comey\u2019s memos first emerged, he was asked why he\u2019d made them. He explained, \u201cI understood this to be my recollection recorded of my conversation with the president\u201d (emphasis added). I observed at the time that, as an old prosecutor, that got my antennae pinging. To non-attorneys, this was just gobbledygook. But as any trial lawyer can tell you, \u201crecollection recorded\u201d is not an idle phrase. It is a term of art in the Federal Rules of Evidence (specifically, Rule 803(5), \u201cRecorded Recollection\u201d).\n\nMost out-of-court statements (e.g., a news story about an event) are inadmissible as hearsay. But under some circumstances, \u201crecollection recorded\u201d is an exception to the hearsay rule. To qualify, the recollection must be recorded (such as in a memo) at the time an incident was fresh in the witness\u2019s memory, so that it accurately reflects the witness\u2019s knowledge. That\u2019s why \u2014 if you\u2019re not only an FBI official but a seasoned trial lawyer, such as Jim Comey \u2014 you\u2019d want to write it down contemporaneously or immediately after the relevant event. Perhaps in a car speeding to a meeting with fellow investigators to report back to them about the investigation you\u2019ve just done, despite telling your prime suspect, the incoming president, that you are not investigating him.\n\nThanks to the IG report, we now know more of the gory details. But as I\u2019ve tried to show in Ball of Collusion, the underlying truth has been discernible for a long time.
