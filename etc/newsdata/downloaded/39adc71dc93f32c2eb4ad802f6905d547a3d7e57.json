In his new book, What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence, Schwarzman reveals some of the biggest lessons he\u2019s learned from his 50-year career in business.\n\n\u201cI wanted to lay out my years of experience of doing things right as well as doing things wrong,\u201d he tells Fortune. \u201cYou learn the most when you make a mistake.\u201d\n\nPart memoir, part leadership guide, Schwarzman addresses the highlights (and low lights) of his career including quitting his high-power job to start Blackstone, raising capital as a first-time fund manager, and dealing with the fallout from the unraveling of his presidential CEO business council. (I personally enjoyed the part when he talks about meeting \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 and her husband Jay-Z.\u201d He writes: \u201cWe talked for a few minutes, reminiscing about her Kennedy Center performance in 2005.\u201d)\n\nSchwarzman was 38 years old when he founded Blackstone in 1985, and he\u2019s been at the helm ever since. Today, the firm boasts $545 billion in assets under management and 2,500 employees. Blackstone recently converted from a publicly traded partnership to a corporation, which makes it easier to own Blackstone stock and allows the firm to be included in more indexes.\n\nI sat down with Schwarzman for a wide-ranging conversation about Blackstone\u2019s dealings in China, the ethical challenges surrounding artificial intelligence, the rise of cryptocurrencies, and whether he sees a looming recession on the horizon.\n\nThis Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nFORTUNE: In the book, you discuss some of the personality traits you look for in a candidate before hiring them at Blackstone. What are some of those characteristics?\n\nSCHWARZMAN: I\u2019m undoubtedly better at identifying people who have enormous potential, and it\u2019s actually pretty easy. When someone\u2019s interviewing for a job, you can tell if they\u2019re comfortable in their own skin and whether they\u2019re able to handle anything conversationally. I\u2019m looking for people who can hold the table, who are intelligent, curious, courteous, and they can deal with stressful situations.\n\nCan you give an example of how you determine those things?\n\nYou need three to five minutes to figure out if someone\u2019s comfortable.I like to bring up something interesting that has happened in the world that day. Today, I might ask, \u201cWhat do you think about what\u2019s been going on in Hong Kong?\u201d There\u2019s no right or wrong answer to these things, but it\u2019s a discussion that can show you how someone\u2019s mind works. Once you see how somebody\u2019s mind works, you also get a sense of whether they\u2019re playing within their comfort zone. If you\u2019d like to spend more time with them, then that\u2019s probably a good person to hire.\n\nSpeaking of Hong Kong, has the current unrest affected Blackstone\u2019s dealings in China?\n\nHong Kong\u2019s a real hub for us. It\u2019s our biggest location in Asia, and people like working there. It hasn\u2019t interfered with our office at this point, but longer-term, you can\u2019t have a place where you do business where no one knows if they can get in or out. Ultimately, there has to be a resolution. The business community really wants one, and if you have a core of demonstrators who say on TV that they are prepared to die, that\u2019s not a great benchmark. Right now, it\u2019s looking like a difficult resolution.\n\nWhat are you investing in, and where do you see growth opportunities?\n\nGrowth is certainly going to technology, services, and experiences. You have things like shopping centers. When I grew up, it was like: What could go wrong with a shopping center? And now that thing is called Amazon. Just that technological innovation has changed people\u2019s shopping patterns, changed the delivery mechanism, and it\u2019s led to shopping centers going bankrupt. It\u2019s disrupted a whole chain of things people took for granted. It took 10 years for an entire stable structure to be dismantled.\n\nWe saw that in 2011 when we started buying warehouses. We\u2019ve been the largest buyer of warehouses in the world for the last eight years, and we did that because that\u2019s where Amazon and retailers needed to stage their goods before they get delivered. So that area has exploded with growth. If you\u2019re investing now, you have to recognize that almost everything\u2019s about to have its business model changed.\n\nWhat\u2019s another example of a sector you think will experience Amazon-like growth?\n\nArtificial intelligence. AI will affect the whole healthcare industry, from billing, to admissions, to diagnostics, to the development of drugs, to telemedicine, which will have enormous growth. You look at all of this, and there are a lot of different things that go into what you or I believe is just a hospital. AI is going to have a profound impact on our society.\n\nThere will also be serious ethical implications that come with that innovation.\n\nThat\u2019s why I did this big donation at MIT and Oxford. [Note: Schwarzman donated $350 million to MIT for computing and AI research and $188 million to Oxford University for AI ethics research.] One involves technological innovation, and the other is about making sense of it in society. What are good outcomes and what are not-so-good outcomes? Who makes that determination, and how do you control for not having bad outcomes? That\u2019s a challenge that we have to face.\n\nAre you confident we\u2019ll be able to solve the ethical challenges quickly enough given the pace at which technology is evolving?\n\nLike most things in technology, it\u2019s moving faster than your ability to control and implement things. On the other hand, everybody who\u2019s running a company or is part of the discovery of AI watched the Internet get developed. I haven\u2019t met a mature person yet who was involved in the development of the internet that hasn\u2019t regretted they developed it.\n\nThey said, \u201cWe just thought this would be really cool. Everyone in the world can connect, and it\u2019ll be a positive sum game.\u201d They weren\u2019t aware that [the internet] would destroy the ability to govern. Everything is so short-term, there\u2019s so much divisiveness, and social media is very destructive. They\u2019ve looked at what they\u2019ve created, and they\u2019ve all said, \u201cIf I could have it back, I\u2019d take it back.\u201d I was shocked. So with AI, we have to get right on it so that the technology itself doesn\u2019t overwhelm society.\n\nThere\u2019s enormous interest and good will to doing something important in terms of AI ethics. No matter what country you\u2019re in, if you make a huge cut in your workforce, you\u2019ll have social unrest of some type. We already have that in the West. You could even have that in China, although they\u2019re investing so much in the area, they\u2019re actually creating a whole bunch of new jobs too.\n\nSpeaking of innovation, a 2007 Fortune article called you \u201cthe master of the alternative universe\u201d because Blackstone made its name by investing in alternative assets. What do you think about frontier assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\n\nI don\u2019t have much interest in that because it\u2019s hard for me to understand. I was raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies. There\u2019s a reason to want to control currencies, which is why governments all do it. There\u2019s no one who says, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Part of that is to make sure the economy is as insulated as it can be from excesses. Another part of it is to control bad behavior. So the idea that you can transact without anybody knowing anything, you could have a lot of criminal behavior \u2014 dirty money, drug money \u2014 running all over the world. It only encourages that kind of activity.\n\nI may be a limited thinker, but that\u2019s a problem. If they could solve that problem and also the problem of controlling the money supply, then it might be OK. That doesn\u2019t mean that the blockchain technology applied to non-tradable currencies is not a good thing. That is clearly a good thing.\n\nAnd why do you say that?\n\nThere\u2019s all kinds of uses you can have from certain executions. [Blockchain technology] is a very good idea, and it will end up being adopted because it\u2019s good technology. Applying it to the creation of money is sort of, for my taste, pretty odd.\n\nSo in the future, you do see Blackstone investing in companies that are using blockchain technology?\n\nThat would be good because it\u2019s a sound, very interesting technology.\n\nBut you\u2019re not going to own any Bitcoin?\n\nThat\u2019s an easy one: No.\n\nCapital has become quite abundant these days. Softbank\u2019s Masayoshi Son tells this infamous story about how he raised $45 billion in 45 minutes for the Vision Fund. Blackstone\u2019s assets under management crossed half a trillion for the first time \u2014 to $545 billion. You recently described your fundraising efforts as \u201can out of body experience.\u201d Why?\n\nWhen I started in 1985, we had no reputation, and even worse, no experience making investments. In 1986, we went out and started raising money. We got rejected by 16 out of 17 people, some of whom we knew very well. If you\u2019ve ever had the experience of getting rejected by almost everyone you know, it\u2019s very sobering.\n\nWe sent out somewhere around 500 offering documents, and we ended up with 32 investors. That\u2019s 468 out of 500 people who are saying, \u201cI don\u2019t trust you, I don\u2019t like you, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re competent, and I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d The only way you interpret that after a while is that they don\u2019t like you and they don\u2019t trust your abilities. It was unending. So my experience was so searingly negative that every dollar we raise from anyone now, I regard as precious and that we can\u2019t disappoint them.\n\nBefore, I\u2019d fly across the country to see if we could get $5 or $10 million, and now, people just give us a billion dollars. After a while, people develop confidence in you. And part of the art of running a good organization is that you don\u2019t mess it up. It\u2019s been such an ordeal to get here.\n\nI had a conversation this morning where someone [at the firm] said, \u201cIf we do this type of structure for this type of activity, these people will give us $2 billion.\u201d I know the people, and I know they\u2019ll give us $2 billion, but I ask, \u201cDo we want to do what they\u2019re interested in or not?\u201d Whenever one of these conversations happens, I think back to spending two days of my life flying around to raise $5 million, and here\u2019s just a casual conversation [about $2 billion]. I take nothing for granted, and I want people at the firm to think like that too. It\u2019s harder when you get bigger, but it still is an out-of-body experience for me.\n\nIn the book, you give your rules on identifying market tops and bottoms. Where in the cycle do you think we are today?\n\nWe\u2019re getting pretty toppy. The prices of things have gotten high in large part because interest rates have gone down so much but that props up the value of a dollar of earnings, or cash-flow. It\u2019s a bigger yield. That\u2019s driven prices up. There\u2019s quite good liquidity in terms of credit. It\u2019s led to markets that have gone up almost continually for about 10 years. So that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t go on for a while longer, but you\u2019re closer to the top than the middle or the bottom.\n\nDo you see a recession on the horizon?\n\nI don\u2019t. Over 70% of the economy is consumer [spending], and consumers tend to be employees or workers. Their compensation is going up 3 to 4% a year now, significantly outpacing inflation. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re loading up consumers because as employees, they didn\u2019t have a good enough experience with financial sufficiency and they were angry because they didn\u2019t have enough money. So society\u2019s going to give them that money, I believe, in the form of higher wages. That\u2019s good for the system because people will have to work to get more money, but they\u2019ll take that money and they\u2019ll spend it. If they\u2019re spending it \u2014 and that\u2019s the vast bulk of the American economy \u2014 then that\u2019ll be the part that keeps the economy moving forward.\n\nUnless there\u2019s a major geo-political issue that takes away confidence from everyone, I think we\u2019ll continue growing for the next year or two but at a lower rate than we were because manufacturing\u2019s off, global trade is off, and we\u2019re facing some lack of confidence around issues like Brexit, European growth, and China\u2019s real growth rate. All these issues contribute to less optimism, but I don\u2019t see us falling off some kind of cliff.\n\nYou don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be comparable to the last recession?\n\nOh gosh no. No, that takes virtual complete abdication by regulators as well as imprudent behavior by parts of the business community. We haven\u2019t forgotten lessons that quickly. The system has been significantly reformed, so I don\u2019t see anything of the type of global financial crisis of 2008. Of all the things to worry about, that\u2019s not one of them.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for you? Do you see yourself stepping away from Blackstone?\n\nIn a year or two, I\u2019ll probably still be sitting at this conference table. I love what I do, but there\u2019s always an evolution. Jon Gray is president of the firm, he\u2019s 49 \u2014 I\u2019m not. [Gray is Schwarzman\u2019s likely successor.]\n\nMy plan for my life is to stay involved with Blackstone, but I also like doing big impactful things that involve the creation of something new. I don\u2019t know what the next one will be because it has to be something I see in society where I can help provide a unique solution. Both MIT and Oxford involve building new facilities, creating new organizations, and developing knowledge in a way that can be applied for the good of society.\n\nI wish I could tell you exactly what the next chapter is, but one of the things that makes life fun is experiencing new things with developed skills from your past. I\u2019ve loved doing that within Blackstone, I\u2019ve loved doing it in the not-for-profit area, and I\u2019d love to do in the political area if I can help.\n\nOh, you have political ambitions?\n\n\n\nNo, no. None.", "description": "Schwarzman addresses what\u2019s going on at Blackstone \u2014 and what\u2019s next for him.", "authors": ["Christopher Martin", "Danielle Abril", "Chris Morris"], "top_image": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/thumbnail_SAS-portrait.jpg?resize=1200,600", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
