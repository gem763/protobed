The outlet also reported that Lawrence wore a Dior wedding dress.\n\nThe glitzy guest list included Adele, Ashley Olsen, Emma Stone, Kris Jenner, and Amy Schumer, according to People, and at Friday\u2019s rehearsal dinner, stars like Cameron Diaz and Nicole Ritchie enjoyed a clambake.\n\nView photos Jennifer Lawrence and Cooke Maroney.

TMZ reported the pair hired wedding planner Mark Seed for the affair with 150 people reportedly in attendance. Guests were treated to an extravagant menu, including wood-roasted fish with herbs and lemon-infused butter or five-week-aged leg of beef with forager's sauce for their entree. As for dessert, house-made marshmallow s'mores were reportedly on the menu.\n\nLawrence\u2019s wedding venue was rumored to be haunted at one point with ghost and murder mystery tours being offered years ago. The chateau was purchased in 2012 by Alex and Ani founder Carolyn Rafaelian who renovated and cleansed the property. \"There were energies and entities, some not pleasant. I had a shaman perform ceremonies. We did a major cleansing, energy-wise. There was a lot of heaviness, but we took care of that. Now the house has a different vibration,\" she told the New York Times in 2013.\n\nThe nuptials come one month after the Oscar-winning actress, 29, and her art dealer beau, 34, were spotted at New York City\u2019s marriage bureau. It's unclear if Lawrence and Maroney, who had famed photographer Mark Seliger in tow, legally wed during the September outing or simply obtained their marriage license. Page Six reported the couple's entourage also included two security guards and a friend. Regardless, it was always Lawrence's plan to have a large wedding celebration.\n\nDuring a chat on the Naked with Catt Sadler podcast a few months ago, the Silver Linings Playbook star said she was pretty relaxed about planning her wedding. \"I\u2019ve been in a good place. I haven\u2019t been neurotic about it. I\u2019m, like, too lazy to be neurotic,\" Lawrence quipped. \"I saw a dress I liked, I was like, \u2018That\u2019s the dress.\u2019 I saw a venue, I was like, \u2018Cool, we got the venue.'\"\n\nView photos Belcourt of Newport Castle in Rhode Island.

Is he nice? Is he kind?\u2019 It\u2019s just \u2014 this is the one, I know that sounds really stupid but he\u2019s just, he\u2019s \u2014 you know. He\u2019s the greatest person I\u2019ve ever met, so I feel very honored to become a Maroney.\"", "description": "The actress's wedding venue was rumored to be haunted years ago.", "authors": ["Taryn Ryder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5E_9zaukFeh3NyeK39msLQ--~B/aD01MDAwO3c9MzM3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/f70f90e0-e0ac-11e9-a5b9-e64d1724af5e", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
