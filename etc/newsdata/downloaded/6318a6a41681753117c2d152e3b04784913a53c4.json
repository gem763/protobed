They were patient, well drilled, tactically astute and seized on their scoring opportunities.\n\nBy halftime, Scotland already had three of the four tries they needed to secure the crucial bonus point and captain John Barclay said he knew the fourth would come if they kept building pressure.\n\nScotland ran in six tries in the second half.\n\n\u201cThere was a little bit of nerves because we knew the responsibility that we had, so to go in 21-0 at half time was brilliant,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we had the game in the bag we threw the ball around.\n\n\u201cI think Russia played some good stuff, but the way we played with width and speed and energy was probably too much for them.\n\n\u201cI thought the boys were really professional throughout the week. We prepared really well and they stepped up.\u201d\n\nTownsend said allowing his core group to rest for a few extra days would stand them in good stead for the Japan test.\n\n\u201cTo deliver a performance like that against a Russia side who we knew would cause problems does give you confidence that the players are ready to play their best game on Sunday,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll aspects of our game have to be spot on. Japan are a very good side and ... it is really important we recover well and be in the best position possible to play our best rugby on Sunday.\u201d", "description": "Part one of Scotland's four-day World Cup survival plan has been achieved and the comparative ease with which they saw off Russia should fill coach Gregor Townsend with confidence ahead of Sunday's showdown with Japan in Yokohama.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439096701&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9905L", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
