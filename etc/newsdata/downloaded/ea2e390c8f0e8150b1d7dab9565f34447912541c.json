She was in a school party \u2014 heading, I imagine, for one of the museums of South Kensington, since that\u2019s where they got out \u2014 and she was chomping away at a packet of crisps which she\u2019d dug out of her backpack.\n\nWith lunchtime still an agonising couple of hours away, the temptation of a sneaky mid-morning snack was clearly too powerful for her to resist.\n\nHaving finished the crisps, she then spent the rest of the journey looking at her reflection in the window, turning her head from right to left as she rearranged her hair. If her intention was to look more attractive to her schoolmates, it grieves me to say that she almost certainly failed.\n\nMembers of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union on the Jubilee, Central, Northern and Victoria lines backed the move by more than 95 per cent (pictured, the Victoria Line)\n\nThe unkind thought occurred to me that somebody really ought to give her a piece of fatherly advice: \u2018If you care so much about your appearance, darling, perhaps you should go easy on the snacks.\u2019\n\nBut of course fat-shaming is strictly taboo these days \u2014 blamed, probably rightly, for causing anorexia and other psychological problems in teenage girls (I sometimes count myself blessed that Mrs U and I had only sons and no daughters).\n\nEpidemic\n\nYet if the outgoing Chief Medical Officer gets her way, my snack-munching fellow passenger will have even more to fear. The poor child will run the risk of being carted off in handcuffs by the British Transport Police, to be charged with Dame Sally Davies\u2019s proposed offence of consuming food or drink other than water (or breast milk, in the case of babies) on urban public transport.\n\nThe plan is one of a series of authoritarian recommendations Dame Sally outlines this week in her final report as CMO. Its aim is to cure the country\u2019s growing obesity epidemic, which the OECD said yesterday has slashed three years off average life expectancy. Meanwhile, NHS figures suggest that as many as one in three children aged ten and 11 is now overweight \u2014 a figure we may all find easy to believe from our own observations, particularly in poorer areas.\n\nDame Sally Davies, nicknamed the nation's 'nanny-in-chief' for her bold public health interventions and who today said snacks should be banned on public transport in her most radical proposals to date, said 80 per cent of obesity is down to what we eat\n\nDame Sally\u2019s other recommendations include calorie caps on all dishes and drinks sold by restaurants and takeaways, phasing out advertising in public venues for food and drink deemed unhealthy by the powers that be and extending the soft drinks levy to sugary food, if \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 is not made on cutting sugar consumption by 2021.\n\nShe also floats the idea of enforcing cigarette-style plain packaging for food and drink of which she disapproves.\n\nBut it\u2019s her proposed ban on eating or drinking on urban trains and buses that has attracted the most public attention. And there I find myself torn.\n\nA small part of me welcomes the proposal, though not for the reasons put forward by Dame Sally. My objection is that it\u2019s anti-social to eat or drink on public transport in town \u2014 particularly if the drinker is already drunk or the eater is tucking in to something pungent such as a greasy hamburger or a curry.\n\nAll right, I should own up to being a monstrous hypocrite, since I\u2019ve been known to eat a giant sausage roll bought at Victoria station on my train home from work late at night. But that was only ever as a guilty last resort, when Mrs U was tucked up in bed and there was nothing waiting for me in the oven.\n\nI should add that I see nothing wrong with eating and drinking on longer journeys. Indeed, even strict Dame Sally herself would permit us to take sustenance on the train, say, from London to Edinburgh \u2014 just as long as it\u2019s not too fattening.\n\nBut no. Though I admit that my journeys on transport might be more pleasant if I was spared the noxious fumes from fellow passengers\u2019 takeaways, by far the greater part of me rebels against a ban.\n\nUniform\n\nIndeed, I reckon that an aversion to being bossed about by the authorities \u2014 particularly when we\u2019re told it\u2019s for our own good \u2014 is an integral part of the British character, if we\u2019re still permitted to say such a thing exists.\n\nAs I may have mentioned before, one of my earliest memories is of lying in traction, aged five, at Great Ormond Street children\u2019s hospital, after I\u2019d broken my leg. I\u2019ll never forget a formidable nurse laying a porcelain bedpan beside me and saying: \u2018Don\u2019t you dare kick that off the bed, Tommy, or it will break. Then we\u2019ll have to give you a great big spinster bedpan instead.\u2019\n\nTOM UTLEY: I don\u2019t dispute for one moment that the growth in obesity is an extremely serious matter (stock image)\n\nLeave aside that odd use of the word \u2018spinster\u2019, which confused me for years afterwards. Until that nurse in her starched uniform told me not to, it simply hadn\u2019t occurred to me to break the bedpan. But no sooner was the instruction out of her mouth than I wanted to do nothing else. So I gave the bedpan a mighty kick with my left leg (the one that wasn\u2019t in traction) and it smashed into a thousand pieces on the floor. I can still hear the gratifying, ear-shattering crash as I write.\n\nIndeed, to this day, nothing tempts me more strongly to walk on the grass, feed the ducks, smoke, spit, forget to wash my hands, play a ball game, run by the pool or talk to the driver than a notice telling me not to (though, British to the core, these days I meekly do as I\u2019m instructed, contenting myself with grumbling about bossy officialdom).\n\nNow, I don\u2019t dispute for one moment that the growth in obesity is an extremely serious matter, with its many associated health risks such as heart problems and childhood diabetes. And though I\u2019m tempted to argue that what we choose to eat, drink or otherwise consume is a matter for each individual alone, I have to admit this is not quite true.\n\nIn fairness to Dame Sally, I should acknowledge that as long as we have a National Health Service, funded by general taxation, the health of the nation will be very much the business of the Government and its agencies.\n\nFreedom\n\nPut bluntly, unhealthy choices \u2014 yes, including my chain-smoking and my thirst for alcoholic refreshment \u2014 tend to end up costing taxpayers a packet (though those who die young, as I expect to, also save public funds a small fortune in pensions and social care).\n\nYet in proposing to dictate by law what, when and where we\u2019re permitted to eat and drink, Dame Sally is surely taking government interference in our lives a giant step too far. Healthy living may be good for us. But isn\u2019t freedom more precious still? As for her warning that people may die from medicine shortages caused by a No Deal Brexit, what about the risk of dying from boredom induced by officialdom\u2019s Project Fear?\n\nIn her appearance this summer on Desert Island Discs, Dame Sally complained that she hated being called \u2018Nanny-in-Chief\u2019, going on to brand those who thus described her as \u2018very sexist\u2019.\n\n\u2018The first woman as CMO gets accused that she is Nanny-in-Chief,\u2019 she said in her irritating, patronising drawl. \u2018What are they going to say to the man?\u2019\n\nWell, I can answer that. For as far back as I can remember, her male predecessors were also attacked as nannies-in-chief. It\u2019s a title that goes with the job \u2014 and I confidently predict that the next time her successor Chris Whitty tries to tell us what\u2019s good for us, the headlines will call him a nanny, too.\n\nI started by suggesting that if that teenager on the train wants to look her best, she should lay off the crisps. In that same spirit of well-meaning advice, may I suggest to Dame Sally and all future CMOs that if they dislike being called nannies, they\u2019ve picked the wrong job.", "description": "TOM UTLEY: Opposite me on the Tube the other morning sat a very chubby girl of about 14 or 15 in a school uniform at least two sizes too small for her.
