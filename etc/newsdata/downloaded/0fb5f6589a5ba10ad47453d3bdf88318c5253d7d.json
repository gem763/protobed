His assistant, Scott Wisemantel, took it one step further, and said that as the sprints disappeared behind them, the mountains were emerging into view.\n\nThe problem with the mountains is they split even the tightest of teams. Team Ineos saw as much in this year\u2019s Tour de France, when team leader Geraint Thomas fell away as young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Egan Bernal rode into the distance.\n\nHow does that equate to rugby, you ask?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The big challenge for Jones\u2019s side was always going to be how they coped with the four-day turnaround between games one and two, and as the results show, they achieved exactly what was needed. 10 points from 10 and a fully fit squad, England sit pretty at the top of Pool C.\n\nThere are two problems though that are now in full view as they begin the World Cup ascent. The first is very obvious: Piers Francis has been cited and almost certainly faces a three-week ban, which in World Cup terms equates to a three-match ban. If England remain in the tournament, Francis will not be available again until the semi-finals in mid-October, which effectively ends his tournament unless injury strikes England\u2019s midfield big guns.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

England have nine days between game two and three in the pool stage, and then seven days between game three and four. Should they make the knockout stage, a week splits each round, depending on how far England go. Suddenly the need to rotate the squad, give everyone a game and keep everyone happy, has gone, and if the past selection decisions from Jones is anything to go by he will select his best squad possible for each and every game.\n\nThat\u2019s why the England training shirts have \u2018Team of 31\u2019 printed across the back of them, in what Wisemantel admitted was something of a subliminal message to help the team buy into what Jones wants. When Jones named his 31-man squad back on 12 August, he admitted that the players who filled places 28-31 in the touring party had to be \u201cgood tourists\u201d. That meant finding players who would find comfort in not playing for up to a month.\n\n\u201cIt puts a test on togetherness but togetherness is one of our themes and the players acknowledge it, they openly talk about it,\u201d said Wisemantel. \u201cIt\u2019s a team of 31, socially they hang out and then when they\u2019re on the field they compete and they compete hard. That\u2019s what we want, that competition so that whether they\u2019re in the 23 or not they\u2019re competing for places, they\u2019re not just passengers.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a test, how you can hang in there and compete. It\u2019s an individual thing to make sure you can get up for every day and compete.\u201d\n\nWisemantel is about as honest as they come, at least in the hub of a World Cup where to give anything away is strangely perceived as a weakness. Where he explains that togetherness is important off the field, he also offers insight how to a breakdown on it helps to iron out any lingering issues that can manifest into genuine problems during a World Cup campaign.\n\nHis example is a good one. During England\u2019s opening World Cup victory over Tonga, England were onto a guaranteed try when Henry Slade fluffed his final pass to Elliot Daly \u2013 guilty of overrunning the man inside him \u2013 and thew the ball straight into touch with the try line begging. The two immediately engaged in verbals \u2013 something that the media have no hesitation in picking up on, but Wisemantel was one of the more pleased to see it.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re competing and we\u2019re competing hard and you\u2019re not happy with what I\u2019ve done or I\u2019m not happy with what you\u2019ve done, then we actually sort it out afterwards like \u2018mate, don\u2019t do that, what were you thinking?\u2019\u201d said Wisemantel. \u201cIt\u2019s real simple.\n\n\u201cA little bit is good, it creates electricity. An example would be from the Tonga game for instance. On the field there was a miscommunication between Sladey and Elliot, and then straight afterwards they sorted it. I thought it was brilliant. They ripped into each other, \u2018I want you here, I need you here\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking wants and needs \u2013 maslow \u2013 and ok, they sorted it and they sorted it very quickly. It was brilliant.\u201d\n\nThe test though lies in whether that ability to sort out problems within the squad remains as the weeks go by. With Slade yet to make a start this season, the prospects of him forcing his way into a starting midfield that will also feature Manu Tuilagi, Jonathan Joseph and, it seems, Owen Farrell, are highly unlikely. If that scenario arises again in training or when a player pushing for a starting berth comes on late in the day, will the same constructive debate happen, or will the \u2018Team of 31\u2019 quickly descend into a \u2018Team of One\u2019?\n\nAs the Tour proves, there is no space for passenger, nor any place for lone wolves.", "description": "Eddie Jones made it clear this was the end of the first stage.
