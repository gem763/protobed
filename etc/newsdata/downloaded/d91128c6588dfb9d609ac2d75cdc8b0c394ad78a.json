The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure.\"\n\nThe delay means that Britain will no longer crash out of the EU without a deal on Halloween if parliament does not approve the Brexit deal in time, as had previously been the case.\n\nUnder the terms of the EU treaties, the UK could leave before February if MPs approve the withdrawal agreement before the deadline is up.\n\nThe extension was resisted by Emmanuel Macron's France, which had argued that a shorter delay would put more pressure on Westminster to approve the deal Boris Johnson struck with Brussels just over a week ago. Member states ultimately backed the longer extension on the basis that it was the length requested by Mr Johnson on instruction of parliament. EU member states are loathe to be seen to be getting involved in internal UK political debates and felt the option was the most neutral response.\n\nMr Johnson's revised withdrawal agreement passed its first hurdle in the House of Commons last week, but some diplomats fear that the narrow coalition of MPs in favour of passing it \u2013 which ranges from Labour rebels to Tory Brexiteers \u2013 may not hold up under scrutiny.\n\nThe Government's proposed timetable to pass the deal by 31 October without much parliamentary scrutiny \u2013 which would have been unprecedented for a major international treaty \u2013 was already shot down by MPs, who say the withdrawal agreement bill needs to be properly read and possibly revised before it is put into UK law.\n\nThe delay under 31 January 2020 also gives time for the UK to hold a general election, if parliament can agree to one. The government needs a two thirds majority to call an early general election, though one could be held with a simply majority if the government lost a vote of no confidence by a simple majority. In that latter case, the other parties would be given the opportunity to form a new government before an election was triggered \u2013 a delay which means a vote could not happen until next year.\n\nMore follows\u2026", "description": "The European Union has agreed to extend the Brexit deadline until February next year by approving a further extension of Article 50.
