Colonel who testified that a transcript of Trump's call with the president of Ukraine \u2013 which the president brandished as proof of his innocence \u2013 had key information omitted.\n\nThe president called national security staffer Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified Tuesday, a 'Never Trumper' \u2013 a term he has used to attack political opponents from within the Republican Party. Last week, Trump branded 'Never Trumper Republicans' as 'human scum.'\n\nTrump also said Vindman found no 'quid pro quo' \u2013 hours after the New York Times reported that he told lawmakers he had sought to insert information into the transcript of Trump's call where ellipses.\n\nVindman testified he was blocked in his effort to restore information to a call transcript that related directly to an alleged quid pro quo \u2013 that the White House used military aid and a White House visit to push an investigation of Burisma, a company tied to Joe Biden's son.\n\nPresident Donald Trump attacked an Army Lt. Colonel who provided potentially damaging testimony to a House impeachment inquiry, calling him a 'Never Trumper'\n\n'Yesterday\u2019s Never Trumper witness could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call,' Trump tweeted. 'There were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt!' he wrote.\n\nTrump's attack came hours after House Republican Conference chair Rep. Liz Cheney tore into commentators who went after Vindman before his testimony. She called out something she called 'shameful ... and that is questioning the patriotism, questioning the dedication to country, of people like Mr. Vindman.'\n\nTrump last week tweeted: 'The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!'\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, told House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that the White House transcript of the July call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president was \u2018mostly accurate\u2019 but missed key words or crucial phrases that he tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to have corrected.\n\nIt is not clear why Trump identified Vindman as a 'Never Trumper.' His last registration was in highly-Democratic Washington, D.C., where he registered no party affiliation. He has since moved to Virginia. He was registered as a Democrat when he lived in New York.\n\nTwo conservative commentators, former Bush White House attorney John Yoo and former GOP Rep. Sean Duffy tried to walk back their attacks on Vindman following blow-back of their televised criticism.\n\nVindman, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, told House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that the White House transcript of the July call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president omitted crucial words or phrases that he tried, but failed, to restore.\n\nThe omissions, Vindman said, included Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky mentiuoning by name the energy company that once employed Hunter Biden to its board, Burisma Holdings.\n\nAlexander Vindman, director for European affairs on the National Security Council, was awarded Purple Heart after sustaining injuries while deployed in Iraq\n\n\u2018He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue,\u2019 the White House\u2019s transcript quotes Zelensky saying.\n\nHowever, Vindman insists Zelensky specifically mentioned Burisma, telling investigators he tried to have the White House's transcript changed to include the missing reference but the amendment was never made.\n\nThe rough transcript also contains ellipses in three instances where Trump is talking, which again Vindman says he tried to amend. He told investigators the third set of ellipses relates to Trump speaking about alleged recordings of former Vice President Joe Biden boasting about illegal Ukraine funding.\n\nIt's believed the Trump's mention of the tapes is most likely referring to comments Biden made in January 2018 that the US held $1 billion in loan guarantees until the nation fired its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin.\n\nThe comments led Republicans to believe Biden was actively trying to prevent an investigation into his son from being launched. Democrats say Shokin was lax in his anti-corruption efforts and was not fit for the job.\n\nSuch omissions, Vindman said, included Trump\u2019s proclamation that there were recordings of former Vice President Joe Biden discussing Ukrainian corruption, and the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, directly mentioning the energy company who employed Hunter Biden to its board, Burisma Holdings\n\nThough a number of Vindman's suggested edits were made, such as particular wording, the two cited corrections were never amended for reasons currently unknown.\n\nDressed in his dark blue Army uniform with military medals displayed proudly across his chest, Vindman didn\u2019t suggest a motive behind the editing process during his more than 10-hour testimony, though his claims will likely prompt investigators to further scrutinize how officials handed the call.\n\nSuch lines of inquiry are likely to probe any changes to the transcript, the decision enter it into the White House\u2019s most classified computer system, and whether such actions were purposefully made to conceal the call\u2019s most controversial contents.\n\nVindman, who was listening in on the call from the White House Situation Room along with other members of Vice President Pence\u2019s staff, said he was so 'concerned by the call' \u2014 and the idea the president\u2019s request could be seen as 'a partisan play' that could 'undermine U.S. national security' \u2014 that he reported it to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\n\n\u2018I was concerned by the call,\u2019 Vindman said. \u2018I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\u2019\n\nHunter Biden (left) took a post on the board of Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, after his father became the Obama administration's point man on U.S.-Ukraine relations, and was reportedly paid $50,000-$80,000 each month for several years\n\nDressed in his dark blue Army uniform with military medals displayed proudly across his chest, Vindman didn\u2019t suggest a motive behind the editing process during his more than 10-hour testimony earlier today, though his claims will likely prompt investigators to further scrutinize how officials handed the call\n\nThe House inquiry is looking into Trump's call, in which he asked Zelenskiy for a \u2018favor\u2019 - to investigate Democrats - that the Democrats say was a quid pro quo for military aid and could be an impeachable offense.\n\nWith the administration directing staff not to appear, Vindman was the first current White House official to testify before the impeachment panels, after being issued a subpoena.\n\nTrump took to Twitter on Tuesday to denounce the probe as a 'sham,' adding: 'Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER!'\n\nVindman, who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old from the former Soviet Union, said that it was his 'sacred duty' to defend the United States.\n\nSome Trump allies, looking for ways to discredit Vindman, questioned the colonel's loyalties because he was born in the region. But the line of attack was rejected by some Republicans, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who said it was 'shameful' to criticize his patriotism.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called the slams on Vindman 'absurd, disgusting and way off the mark. This is a decorated American soldier, and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands.'\n\n\u2018He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue,\u2019 the White House\u2019s transcript cites Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (left) as saying. However, Vindman insists Zelensky specifically mentioned Burisma Holdings, telling investigators he tried to have the White House's transcript changed to include the missing reference.\n\nTrump took to Twitter on Tuesday to denounce the probe as a 'sham,' adding: 'Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER!'\n\nThe testimony came the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would vote on a resolution to set rules for public hearings and a possible vote on articles of impeachment.\n\nThursday's vote would be the first on the impeachment inquiry and aims to nullify complaints from Trump and his allies that the process is illegitimate and unfair.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the resolution merely 'confirms that House Democrats' impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote.'\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he and other GOP lawmakers will review the resolution to see if it passes a 'smell test' of fairness to Trump.\n\nThe session Tuesday grew contentious at times as House Republicans continued trying to unmask the still-anonymous whistleblower and call him or her to testify. Vindman said he is not the whistleblower and does not know who it is.\n\nGOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio acknowledged Republicans were trying to get Vindman to provide the names of others he spoke to after the July 25 phone call, in an effort to decide whom to call to testify. 'He wouldn't,' Jordan said.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Vindman testified that in spring of this year he became aware of 'outside influencers' promoting a 'false narrative of Ukraine' that undermined U.S. efforts, a reference in particular to Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nHe first reported his concerns after a July 10 meeting in which U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland stressed the importance of having Ukraine investigate the 2016 election as well as Burisma, a company linked to the family of Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nVindman says he told Sondland that 'his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.'\n\nThat differs from the account of Sondland, a wealthy businessman who donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and testified before the impeachment investigators that no one from the NSC 'ever expressed any concerns.' Sondland also testified that he did not realize any connection between Biden and Burisma.\n\nVindman, who was listening in on the call from the White House Situation Room along with other members of Vice President Pence\u2019s staff, said he was so 'concerned by the call' \u2014 and the idea the president\u2019s request could be seen as 'a partisan play' that could 'undermine U.S. national security' \u2014 that he reported it to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel\n\nFor the call between Trump and Zelenskiy, Vindman said he listened in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and Vice President Mike Pence's office. He said he again reported his concerns to the NSC's lead counsel.\n\nHe wrote, 'I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security.'\n\nVindman served as the director for European affairs and a Ukraine expert under Fiona Hill, a former official who testified earlier in the impeachment probe. Hill worked for former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nHe told investigators that Ukraine, in trying to become a vibrant democracy integrated with the West, is a bulwark against overt Russian aggression.\n\nVindman attended Zelenskiy's inauguration with a delegation led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and he and Hill were both part of a Ukraine briefing with Sondland that others have testified irritated Bolton at the White House.\n\n'I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics,' wrote Vindman, who was wounded in Iraq and awarded a Purple Heart.\n\n'For over twenty years as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations,' he wrote.", "description": "The president again attacked Lt.
