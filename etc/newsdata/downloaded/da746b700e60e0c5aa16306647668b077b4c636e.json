Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, unveiled a sweeping anti-poverty proposal that includes six bills. She is seen above speaking at a town hall in New York on Thursday\n\nUnder her proposal, landlords would only be able to raise rents by a maximum of 3 per cent every year - or in line with the increase in the consumer price index - whichever is greater.\n\nThe set of proposed laws would also allow anyone convicted of a crime to gain access to federal poverty programs.\n\nA study by the Brookings Institute found that nearly half of freed former inmates have no reported earnings in the first several years after leaving prison while half of those who do find work earn less than $10,090 a year.\n\nFormerly incarcerated people are also often denied government benefits because they have criminal records, thus perpetuating the cycle of poverty.\n\n\u2018I think this really starts to approach, head on, economic injustice in America,\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times last week.\n\n\u2018We are at our richest point that we\u2019ve ever been, but we\u2019ve also been our most unequal.\u2019\n\nPerhaps one of the more controversial elements of her proposal is to grant those without legal status in the United States unfettered access to social services.\n\n\u2018Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any Federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual\u2019s immigration status,\u2019 her proposal reads.\n\n'A Just Society' would institute rent control nationwide while granting illegal immigrants and released convicts access to federal benefits\n\nOcasio-Cortez defines a federal public benefit as \u2018any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and...any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.\u2019\n\nAOC acknowledges that there is virtually no chance that any of her proposals could win passage given the current makeup of Congress and the White House.\n\nStill, she doesn\u2019t appear to be deterred.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shortage of obstacles that we have ahead of us, but I don\u2019t think that we not do things just because they\u2019re hard,\u2019 she told the Times.\n\n\u2018In fact, sometimes the hard things to do are the most worthwhile.\u2019", "description": "The set of bills 'aims to combat the greatest threats to our country, our democracy, and our planet: economic inequality and climate change,' AOC writes on her web site.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/14/19361808-0-image-a-4_1570368531497.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
