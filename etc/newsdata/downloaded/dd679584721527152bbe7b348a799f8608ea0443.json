Early on, he was working a late night at the team facility when he saw Belichick on a treadmill in a dark weight room watching film and taking notes.\n\nVONTAZE BURFICT'S 'HEART IS BROKEN' OVER SEASON-LONG SUSPENSION, RAIDERS' DEREK CARR SAYS\n\n\u201cI hurry and scatter out of there so he doesn't by any chance see me,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cThat's the last thing I would want at that time of my life and career because then I'd have to engage in a potential conversation and I don't know if I had the stamina for that at that time.\u201d\n\nBut soon afterward, came the truly uncomfortable encounter.\n\n\u201cI just so happen to walk by the hot tub and coach is in the hot tub. Obviously, I came in the room to go in the hot tub. But then we made eye contact and my natural instinct was to turn around like I was gonna leave,\u201d he said.\n\nSUPER BOWL CHAMPION PERCY HARVIN OPENS UP ABOUT ANXIETY ISSUES, HOW SMOKING WEED HELPED\n\n\u201cBut then I saw that he saw that I was in there and then he got up and got out and real, real big party foul by coach. We're supposed to have shorts on. Supposed to have shorts. But I guess at 11 o'clock, when you're the GOAT of coaching you go wherever you want, free\u2014free ball. So I had to hide my absolute face of terror after seeing what I saw and sit in the hot tub.\u201d\n\nEdelman said he did his thing in the hot tub and then tried to scamper out of there without being seen again by Belichick. The wide receiver said as he was leaving the building he ran into Belichick again.\n\nAs the two were walking toward the exit, Edelman said he tried to strike up a conversation.\n\n\u201cI was sitting there I was like in so much disbelief of everything that was happening, going on that night that I potentially wanted to try and make some small talk with him. And I don\u2019t know where I got the confidence but I asked him, \u2018Coach, it\u2019s pretty amazing that you\u2019re here this late.\u2019\n\nPATRIOTS' BILL BELICHICK'S COMPLIMENTARY WORDS FOR REDSKINS OFFENSE HAS SOME FANS BEFUDDLED\n\n\u201cAnd, he looked back at me and without any hesitation, he goes, \u2018It beats being a plumber.
