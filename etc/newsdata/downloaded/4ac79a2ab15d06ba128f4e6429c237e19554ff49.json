From stand-up comedian to television host to UFC color commentator, Rogan has been a success in every field he\u2019s ever entered. But is he really comparable to legendary broadcaster Walter Cronkite?\n\nAt a time when Americans had only three television channels, Cronkite helmed the CBS Evening News for nearly 20 years. With his calm voice, measured cadence, and apolitical attitude, he consistently polled as \u201cthe most trusted man in America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially I thought my friend was being generous, equating the gold standard in broadcast journalism with a simple DMT merchant. But I\u2019ve since come around to the comparison.\n\nIn 2009, the same year as Cronkite\u2019s death, Joe Rogan started his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. On it, Rogan interviews comedians, UFC fighters, scientists, philosophers, celebrities, journalists, and, increasingly, candidates for president of the United States. From the 2020 Democratic field, he\u2019s already spoken to Andrew Yang, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, and, earlier this month, Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nRogan\u2019s hour-long conversation with Sanders began with them commiserating about the format of the 2020 primary debates. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t even call them a debate,\u201d intoned the second highest polling Democratic candidate. \u201cWhat they are is a reality TV show in which you have to come up with a sound bite and all that stuff. And it\u2019s demeaning to the candidates, and its demeaning to the American people. You can\u2019t explain the complexity of health care in America in 45 seconds. Nobody can.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut everyone is online today. I mean the entire country is essentially getting email and Facebook and all that jazz. Like, why bother doing it in this particular medium that has an inherent time constraint?\u201d asked Rogan. \u201cThe ability to discuss things in long-form like you can do online, like you can do right here right now, you can\u2019t get that on television.\u201d\n\nRogan is right. Even long-form television interviews, given an hour time slot, are comprised of spliced together clips, all edited, with voiceovers interjecting commentary after the fact, featuring commercial interruptions every few minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience often run for two to three hours. These conversations are unedited, with ad reads only before and after they\u2019re conducted. Even if Rogan or a guest has to leave to use bathroom, the record button stays on. It\u2019s through this extended, personal interaction that Rogan is able to make guests comfortable and provide them with an opportunity to speak informally and at length.\n\nAmericans want more of what Rogan is offering, and the proof is in the pudding. For example, Bernie Sanders\u2019 debate performance in June was watched by 18 million people on three separate television networks. He spoke for 11 minutes. At the July debate, Sanders was able to speak for over 17 and a half minutes. But that one, carried only by CNN, had a paltry viewership of only 8.7 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders\u2019 67-minute conversation with Rogan, where the senator spoke the vast majority of the time, has been viewed on YouTube over 9.3 million times. And that isn\u2019t including podcast downloads: The Joe Rogan Experience has been the second most downloaded podcast on Apple for the past two years. While official numbers are not made public, it\u2019s been hinted that Rogan gets over 100 million downloads a month. So where was Sanders\u2019 time better spent?\n\nA poll released in February 2019 by the Columbia Journalism Review found that at least 50 percent of Americans had \u201chardly any confidence at all\u201d in the press as an institution. After decades of malfeasance, mainstream news networks are no longer viewed as credible intermediaries of information. It\u2019s no wonder more than 200,000 people have signed a petition asking the Commission on Presidential Debates to make Joe Rogan a moderator.\n\nBut besides format, the biggest way that Rogan diverges from the corporate press is his lack of an agenda. Now, he doesn\u2019t pretend to be apolitical: he was a vocal supporter of Ron Paul\u2019s presidential campaigns and endorsed Tulsi Gabbard earlier this year. But his own politics are presented as friendly disagreements rather than existential differences.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t occur to him to consider whether his contributions have value. He just speaks his mind. He just whips it out and drops it on the table,\u201d reads a profile in The Atlantic. The author meant that as a negative, but it\u2019s precisely what makes Rogan the fitting heir to the title of \u201cmost trusted man in America.\u201d He\u2019s not looking to necessarily inform or even entertain his viewers. He\u2019s looking to have interesting conversations. And we love to watch them.\n\nThe numbers prove it: Joe Rogan is the last honest broker with broad appeal left in the United States. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nHunter DeRensis is a reporter for The National Interest.
