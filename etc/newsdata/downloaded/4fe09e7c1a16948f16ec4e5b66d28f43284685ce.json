He is replacing Ian Gillespie at RACQ, who is battling cancer.\n\nRACQ, a mutual or member-owned body, does not disclose executive pay and Mr Gillespie was rumoured in industry to be earning $1.7 million annually. Mr Gillespie earlier this year had declined to confirm the amount but said if RACQ was ASX-listed it would be in the top 100 largest companies \u201cso you\u2019d be talking about that kind of remuneration\u201d.\n\nIt has an insurance business which earned almost $890 million in revenue last year. But RACQ's banking arm is small with a lending book of about $1.75 billion, compared to Suncorp's $59.3 billion.\n\nIt had acquired the lending arm in 2016, and RACQ's current banking chief Michelle Bagnall herself is a former Suncorp executive general manager.\n\nMr Carter moved to Australia from the UK when he was 2, growing up on Brisbane's northside, delivering pizzas there for Silvio's while studying commerce and accounting at the University of Queensland.\n\nHis initial stint at ANZ included a stint in credit-risk review in the 1990s, which saw him dealing with people in trouble after a recession in Australia.\n\nHe became chief executive of Suncorp's banking and wealth business shortly after the 2015 appointment of Mr Cameron to Suncorp's top job, and had also worked in its life insurance division.\n\nMr Johnston said Mr Carter had \"been a great contributor \", singling out his implementations of the bank's new payments platform and \"building the foundations for our digital banking strategy\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Carter said he was proud of \"the genuine commitment and care team members demonstrate every day to support our customers and the progress we have made digitising the business making it easier for our customers\".\n\nBut Suncorp's banking and wealth arm has also been under pressure; Citigroup analysts recently described mortgage growth as \"sluggish\" .\n\nProfits in the division were down 1.4 per cent to $364 million, while home the loan book rose 0.4 per cent in what Suncorp described as an increasingly competitive and slowing market.\n\nRACQ chairwoman Bronwyn Morris said Mr Carter's experience in banking and insurance, along with this connection to Queensland, made him \"the ideal fit\".\n\nPrior to Mr Cameron's resignation, there had been speculation that Suncorp was again considering spinning off the banking arm of the business, which is the smaller section of the bancassurance firm. Mr Cameron was reportedly in favour of the move, but the board was more cautious.\n\nBut in September Mr Johnston said this was no longer being considered.\n\n\u201cThe benefits [of the bancassurance model] are the scale that the business has, and the ability for us to invest in digital capability, particularly in our bank, that wouldn\u2019t be available to us if it stood alone,\" he told The Australian Financial Review in September.\n\nIn May 2018, Mr Carter appeared for almost two hours in the witness box at the Hayne royal commission, where he was grilled on Suncorp's attempts to recover the balance of bad business loans within 12 months, even after they were deemed irresponsible by the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case entangled a Victorian man's widow in a complex dispute. Commissioner Kenneth Hayne in an interim report said while Suncorp could have better communicated to the family, the bank's actions had not amounted to misconduct.\n\nMore to come.", "description": "Suncorp's chief executive of banking and wealth, David Carter, has resigned to become the head of RACQ, Queensland\u2019s peak motoring body.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9906%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_477%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/193c51ead04c6ff7e17f0650cbcbda645793110e", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
