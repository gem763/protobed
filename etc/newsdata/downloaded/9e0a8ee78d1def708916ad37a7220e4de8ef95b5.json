Earnings from Kroger Co. ( KR ) come Thursday, as the grocery chain continues to be under pressure, he noted. Let's see if this is already discounted in the marketplace.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of KR, below, we can see that prices have improved since late July. Prices are now above the rising 50-day moving average line and they are positioned to retest the underside of the declining 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows improvement from July and suggests we are seeing a shift from aggressive selling to aggressive buying. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator moved above the zero-line in early August for an outright go-long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of KR, below, we can that prices have been in a sideways range the past two years. Prices have firmed recently to the underside of the declining 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line shows improvement the past two months and the MACD oscillator on this longer time frame shows a cover-shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of KR, below, we can see an upside price target of $29.\n\nBottom line strategy: It looks like traders are either anticipating better numbers or their focus is on next quarter or the quarter after that.", "description": "Earnings are coming out this week, and it looks like traders are either anticipating better numbers or their focus is on next quarter or the quarter after that....KR", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Kroger'S Investors Appear To Be Eyeing The Future", "Earnings Are Coming Out This Week", "It Looks Like Traders Are Either Anticipating Better Numbers Or Their Focus Is On Next Quarter Or The Quarter After That.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Kevin Curran", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/f5bc8b1d-40ea-11e9-87ba-7ded089587c3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
