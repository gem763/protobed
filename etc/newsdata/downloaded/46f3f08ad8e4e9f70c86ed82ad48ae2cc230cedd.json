It roams on its own,' he said, according to a transcript released Sunday by his office. 'That's myasthenia gravis. It's a nerve malfunction. I got it from my grandfather.'\n\nSpeculation has swirled around his health since he took office, but senior aide Senator Christopher 'Bong' Go said 'it's nothing serious,' adding the president is 'conscious of his health'.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte, 74, said he suffered from myasthenia gravis, which causes one of his eyelids to droop, at an appearance before the Philippine community on Saturday night during a visit to Russia (pictured: speaking to an official in Beijing in August)\n\nIndeed, Duterte has previously quipped he'll be dead before the next presidential term in 2022.\n\nWhat is myasthenia gravis? Symptoms: droopy eyelids\n\ndouble vision\n\nweak facial muscles\n\ndifficulty with chewing and swallowing\n\nslurred speech\n\nweak limbs, neck\n\nshortness of breath and occasionally serious breathing problems Prognosis It typically affects the whole body, spreading from the eyes and face over months or years. However, in around 20 percent of people it is localised to the eye muscles (ocular myasthenia). Treatment helps control symptoms and it is rarely life-threatening and does not impact significantly on life expectancy.

He also suffers from Buerger's disease, caused by heavy smoking in his younger days.\n\nDuterte is known for an unorthodox work schedule that typically starts in the mid-afternoon and can go on well beyond midnight.", "description": "Duterte, 74, said he suffers from\u00a0myasthenia gravis, which causes one of his eyelids to droop, at an appearance before the Philippine community on Saturday night during a visit to Russia.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/13/19395428-0-image-a-93_1570452612347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
