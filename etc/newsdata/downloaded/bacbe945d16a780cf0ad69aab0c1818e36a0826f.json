The two Roosevelts, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were mostly sympathetic to the cause of conservation, Ronald Reagan and the second George Bush decidedly less so. But for sheer hostility to environmental values, Donald Trump has no equal.\n\nMr. Trump arrived in the White House with little interest in conservation, his idea of nature framed largely by his golf courses. He was, to boot, almost pathologically dedicated to obliterating anything President Obama had done to reduce global warming gases, preserve open space and help endangered species.\n\nThis translated into a simple operating strategy: Get rid of things the fossil fuel industry didn\u2019t like and rubber-stamp the stuff it wanted.\n\nHence the rollback of Obama rules limiting power plant emissions of greenhouse gases, and the proposed rollback of regulations governing methane, a powerful global warming gas. (Next up, it seems certain, is the reversal of Obama rules mandating more fuel-efficient vehicles.)", "description": "From Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest to Minnesota\u2019s Boundary Waters, the Trump administration wants to despoil, not preserve, America\u2019s resources.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/31/opinion/31enviro1/31enviro1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
