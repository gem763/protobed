Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter Dale Earnhardt\u2019s death on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500, Harvick took over Earnhardt\u2019s vaunted Richard Childress Racing ride the following week at Rockingham \u2014 albeit in a Chevrolet sporting the No. 29 in lieu of the trademark No. 3.\n\nIn his third start in the car, Harvick won at Atlanta, the first of 48 career victories to date. On Sunday at Talladega, Harvick will make his 677th start in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. The 2001 Daytona 500 was Earnhardt\u2019s 676th race in NASCAR\u2019s premier series.\n\n\u201cIt should make a lot of us standing here feel old,\u201d Harvick said on Friday at Talladega. \u201cI think, as you look back and you don\u2019t realize how long it actually has been and \u2014 you guys have heard me say this before \u2014 but in the beginning it was really hard to understand the magnitude of the circumstances the first couple years, just because you didn\u2019t really understand much about what was going on. As you got into the second year and really started to understand what happened the year before, it was already done.\n\n\u201cSometimes you do things and then all of a sudden you get past those things and you haven\u2019t really taken in all of the things that happen because you just didn\u2019t understand them. Really, that first particular year we raced so much, and the team protected me from so many things because we were on the road so much, and didn\u2019t have to really understand the magnitude of it, but there was no hiding from it over an offseason and the next year, as the expectations changed.\n\n\u201cBut when you look at, like when I came in, we started racing 36 races and so it happened a little bit quicker than it would have with \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the total number of years (Earnhardt raced) were \u2014 but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more. It\u2019s definitely a unique number and stat and makes you think back to a lot of things.\u201d\n\nTeam owner Richard Childress will pace the field for Sunday\u2019s 1000Bulbs.com 500 (2 p.m. ET on NBC, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio), accompanied by Johnny Morris, founder of RCR sponsor Bass Pro Shops.\n\nDuring the 50th anniversary season of RCR and the 50th anniversary season of Talladega Superspeedway, Childress will be behind the wheel No. 3 Chevrolet that Earnhardt drove to the final victory of his career \u2014 and his 10th at Talladega \u2014 on Oct. 15, 2000.\n\nHaving moved from RCR to Stewart-Haas Racing, and having won the series championship in 2014, the first year of the elimination format, Harvick will compete in his 20th full season at NASCAR\u2019s highest level next year. Of all the changes that have occurred in major league stock-car racing since his rookie season, Harvick sees the advancements in safety as foremost.\n\n\u201cThe rapid progression of the inside of the car \u2014 that\u2019s the biggest that has changed. Because I live in there on a week-to-week basis and have seen the progression of \u2018You don\u2019t have to really wear gloves if you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t have to wear a full-face helmet if you don\u2019t want to,\u2019 to today, where they\u2019re bugging you all the time to go update your concussion protocol and going to do your physicals and all those things you used to just cowboy up and not do and think that was the right way to do it.\n\n\u201cThe standard of the safety side of things, and it still progresses rapidly today because NASCAR pushes it. The soft walls. The helmets. The seats. I mean, a number of those things have changed, and I would say outside of the car is just the engineering, the amount of engineering that goes into these cars is still going to be surprising to somebody who comes from an industry that\u2019s never seen a NASCAR race.\u201d\n\nELLIOTT SAYS CHEVROLETS WILL MAKE GROUP EFFORT AGAIN AT TALLADEGA\n\nBefore the April 28 race at Talladega Superspeedway this year, Ford had a stranglehold on the 2.66-mile track, having won the seven previous races there.\n\nBut Chevrolet adopted a team strategy for the spring race and swept the podium, with Chase Elliott winning the event, Alex Bowman running second and Ryan Preece finishing third. The team concept worked so well that Elliott is confident it will be more of the same for Sunday.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think it will be really similar from all fronts, and I\u2019m sure all manufacturers will be kind of doing the same thing,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThe Playoff picture is obviously important to some of the guys in each respective group, I suppose. The manufacturers are going to see it as they want the manufacturer to do well, and they see that being better than anything else.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see more of those games being played this weekend. I thought we did equally as good of a job at Daytona as we did here in the spring. We just had some things go our way here in the spring and they didn\u2019t in Daytona. So it goes to show that even though we worked well together and that we all did a nice job, it\u2019s not always going to work. No guarantees, for sure.\u201d\n\nElliott has more on his mind at Talladega than getting a win for Chevrolet. After an early engine failure relegated him to a 38th-place finish last Sunday at Dover, Elliott is seven points below the cut line entering the second race of the Round of 12 in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs.\n\nMOFFITT GUNNING FOR SECOND STRAIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP WITH DIFFERENT TEAM\n\nDefending NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series champion Brett Moffitt has a chance to accomplish something unique in the modern era of NASCAR racing.\n\nThe series leader after the Round of 8 in the Playoffs, Moffitt could win a second straight title with a different team after losing his ride with Hattori Racing Enterprises, the organization that fielded his championship-winning trucks last year.\n\nHow much satisfaction would Moffitt derive from beating his old team for the title?\n\n\u201cA lot,\u201d said the driver of the No. 24 GMS Racing Chevrolet. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s just about winning. They\u2019ve obviously been pretty strong here as they go into the fall, but to win back-to-back championships would be huge.\n\n\u201cI think it says a lot, going from two different manufacturers and two different teams and being able to replicate it. It would mean a lot for me.\u201d\n\nIt would say a lot about the driver, too.\n\n\u201cI hope,\u201d laughed Moffitt. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can do, just trying to keep building the resume.\u201d\n\nNote: Buck Baker is the only driver in any of NASCAR\u2019s top-three touring series to win back-to-back titles with different primary car owners. In 1956, Baker drove for Carl Kiekhaefer in 44 of the 47 races he ran. In 1957, Baker drove his own car for 25 races and ran 15 races for owner Hugh Babb.\n\n\u2014by Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service.
