Sunday morning's landing tallies 2,865 total days for the program overall, the Air Force said.\n\nThe Pentagon, increasingly reliant on space technologies, recently created the U.S. Space Command and is asking Congress to approve funding for a proposed Space Force, which would serve as a new branch of the military.\n\n\"The sky is no longer the limit for the Air Force and, if Congress approves, the U.S. Space Force,\" General David L. Goldfein, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Joey Rouelette in Washington; Editing by Daniel Wallis)", "description": "The Pentagon's secretive X-37B spaceplane landed in Florida on Sunday after a record-long orbital flight lasting more than two years, the U.S. Air Force said, capping the latest test mission for an array of military technologies.
