Can you not see he has been injured?\"\n\nShe added: \"Don't tell me to calm down. I'm not going to calm down.\n\n\"Your breath stinks. Who do you think you are? I will find out where you live and come for you.\"\n\n(Image: Jemma Barrett/ Cavendish Press ()\n\nSecurity staff at Manchester Royal Infirmary threw out Barrett and she was arrested outside.\n\nJust hours earlier she had posted a picture on Facebook of her herself giving the one-fingered salute with the caption: \"Let the birthday antics begin.'\"\n\nAt Manchester magistrates' court Barrett, from Salford, was convicted of a racially aggravated public order offence following a trial.\n\nShe denied wrongdoing and faces up to six months jail when she is sentenced later this month.\n\nThe incident occurred on June 24 this year after Barrett, her brother and a group of friends had been for a night out at Manchester's Gay Village.\n\nDuring the evening he was attacked was taken to hospital at around 4am where he seen by Nurse Amanuel who was on a nightshift.\n\nThe victim, a nurse for eight years told the hearing: \"We sat him in a chair in a corner because the beds were full of patients.\n\n\"Whilst he waiting to be seen by a doctor, a person claiming to be his sister came and asked why he hadn't been seen because he had a head injury.\n\n\"She said 'why the f**k has he not been seen, can you not see he has been injured?'\n\n\"I explained can you calm down we have to other patients that are poorly but she got very upset and she said 'don't tell me to calm down, my nephew died some time ago in the hospital and you told my sister to calm down so don't tell me to calm down'.\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n\"She said 'I'm not going to calm down, your breath stinks'.\n\n\"I said I'm going to have to remove you but she said 'why would you get security,who do you think you are?' He is just sat in a chair nobody is seeing him'.\n\n\"She started to go back and forth in the room pointing to her brother and then coming back and speaking to me.\n\n\"I said 'I have seen him I have taken a history which is why I sat him down'. From my professional opinion he was able to sit and wait to be seen.\n\n\"She was waving her arms around and shouting the whole time when there were 15 other people in that room.\n\n\"I kept saying there was other poorly people and I said 'you don't even need to be here because he is receiving the care that he needs'.\n\n\"But she approached me and was stood facing me so close that if I had my finger in my face I could touch her.\n\n\"She said 'I will find out where you live and I will come for you'.\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n\"I was upset because I was trying to help her brother. This is a place where I work, I come to feel safe and help people, there was no need for that approach.\n\n\"I did feel intimidated because of how close she was. In the emergency department there is an area where we have to leave to go to the car park, we mix with the public at that moment.\n\n\"But what she said made me feel 'how safe am I to go to my own car?' It is a very public place.\n\n\"Before that a colleague of mine had put herself between myself and this lady and said we are going to remove you.\n\n\"Security approached while she was being escorted out of the room she turned around and called me a black b***h loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.\n\n\"It was only the once but then as soon as she said that she was escorted out of the room. I can understand the anxiety and the worry and that she would want me to explain why he was not being attended to by a doctor.\n\n\"I said 'calm down I will explain to you what is going to happen'. But her main issue was 'why have you just sat him here?'\n\n\"What I did was the appropriate approach in my opinion to calm the situation.\n\n(Image: Cavendish Press (Manchester) Ltd)\n\n\"I was happy to show my opinion to her. I wasn't threatening her with security I was telling her what was happening. I was telling her you need to calm down you need to lower your voice.\n\n\"I did explain that he was sat there waiting to see a doctor before any of this happened.\n\n\"We are expected to handle people professionally because we are there at their time of need but she was shouting in the room and verbally being abusive.\n\n\"We get punched, we get spat at a lot of things happen in that department.\n\n\"What upset me was her exact words she approached me, she was standing in my face 'I'm going to find where you are and I'm going to come for you'.\n\n\"The fact that she is denying it now is very sad.\"\n\nBarrett told the hearing: \"My brother got attacked by a few guys in a nightclub.\n\n\"He had a cracked back to his skull and the same above his eyebrow on his forehead and I confronted what I thought was one of the nurses and I said 'can someone see to my brother he is bleeding from his ears?'\n\n\"The other nurse came walking towards me telling me to stay calm which is when I said 'my nephew died in this hospital'.\n\n(Image: MEN MEDIA)\n\n\"I was raising my voice because I was scared. I didn't call her a 'black b***h' and I didn't say 'your breath stinks' - that is not something that would come out of my mouth.\n\n\"My main aim at that moment in time was just to check my brother was OK.\n\n\"I have got black nephews and nieces I wouldn't say something like that.\n\n\"My sister was in a major car crash last year and because the emergency staff left her for seven hours the baby died inside her.\n\n\"I was just concerned for my brother's safety, for him to be checked on as he was slumped on a chair in that A+E room.\n\n\"If I was waving my arms around I was just saying check on my brother. I went outside and rang my mum and the police came over to me and they said 'we are going to have to take you'. It was the same police that came when my brother got beat up.\n\n\"I do think I could have dealt with it a bit better but I also think that they could have dealt with it a bit better too. It would have been normal for me to react like that if my brother is slumped in a chair like that and bleeding.\n\n\"Maybe I would have been swearing and things but I wasn't shouting all the way through. We did have a civil conversation. I can accept that my behaviour wasn't perfect.\n\n\"I wasn't drunk enough to not know what I said. I was worried and I was panicking I stepped out of line for a couple of minutes in the hospital and that is it.\n\n\"I shouted daft b***h, those other words did not come out of my mouth they never have and never will, I've lived around black people all my life I'm not a racist person.\"\n\nProsecutor Nicola Durham said: \"The complainant is a member of NHS staff a nurse working in a busy A&E department and this is the first time she has ever felt the need to being this matter to court.\n\n\"The defendant turned up in a drunk, emotional state demanding attention and not getting her own way and despite the upsetting circumstances the nurse was just trying to do her job.\n\nBut defence lawyer Sacha Waxman said: \"Ms Barrett was upset on that early morning at fact her brother had been there almost 30 minutes, covered in blood with a cracked head open.\"\n\nConvicting Barrett JPs told her: \"Professionalism was apparent in Nurse Amanuel's responses and she kept to the facts without embellishment and you acknowledged your behaviour on the night was inappropriate.\"", "description": "Jemma Barrett, 32, from Salford, Greater Manchester, denied she was racist, saying \"I have black nephews and nieces and have lived around black people all my life\"", "authors": ["Timothy Gallagher", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Jemma Barrett", "Cavendish Press", "Manchester", "Ltd", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20639018.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Cavendish-Press-Manchester-Ltdjpgd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
