Professor Alhabash claims that his intent for sending out such a survey was to show students that \u201cthese messages do unfortunately exist.\u201d\n\nMichigan State University (MSU) is apologizing for an offensive survey that was sent to random students by one of its professors, Saleem Alhabash, which was obtained by one of the school\u2019s independent student newspapers the Morning Watch.\n\nProfessor Alhabash said that he along with a group of his students had created the offensive survey in order to study the social reaction to the slur-filled language.\n\n\u201cThis was in no way, shape, or form, the intent,\u201d said Alhabash to WILX 10. \u201cThe intent was to uncover these messages and shed the light that these messages do unfortunately exist in the real world.\u201d\n\nThe professor added that the survey \u2014 which contained more than 100 racial slurs and vulgarities \u2014 was sent to students at random, and had included a disclaimer, letting participants know that \u201csome of the statements included in this study might be offensive for the use of racially charged and profane language.\u201d\n\nSome of the offensive survey statements included the following:\n\n\u201cHaha there is nothing \u2018positive\u2019 about N*GGERS let alone the word that describes N*GGERS.\u201d [asterisks added]\n\n\u201cHomos. Faggots. Dick loving pricks. I hate them. There is no room on earth for you queers. Put a bullet in your mouth and suck on the tip of a loaded gun if you love sucking things so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you call black-on-black crime? Gorilla warfare.\u201d\n\n\u201cI personally think they should shoot them all at the border and call it good\u2026 it\u2019ll save us hard working AMERICANS billions of dollars on our taxes ;)\u201d\n\n\u201cAsians act like they\u2019re the only people on the fucking planet. If only Hitler was reborn in Asia right now that would be fucking awesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo work on your suicide vest you dirty fucking Muslim.\u201d\n\nStudents were then asked to measure how offensive, positive, stereotypical, funny, negative, or prejudiced they found each of the survey statements to be.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that the psychology department or administration would allow for this to be created,\u201d said MSU freshman Kennedy Parker to the Morning Watch, adding that \u201cevery single [survey] comment is a racial stereotype and is extremely hurtful and offensive.\u201d\n\nMSU president Samuel Stanley said in a statement that the incident \u2014 as well as several other separate recent instances on campus \u2014 have \u201cdisrupted a sense of safety that should exist for everyone. Building inclusive communities is at the core of our values, and the impact of recent events cannot be underestimated.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur community has been affected in the past several days by incidents causing concern and anger,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cI, too, am concerned, because a safe, inclusive and respectful campus is my top priority. Hate has no home at Michigan State. We want every individual to feel welcomed, valued and heard.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Michigan State University Professor Saleem Alhabash is apologizing for sending a slur-filled survey riddled with racist and homophobic language to students.
