RPT-Asia Rice-India prices hit multi-month lows as buyers defer purchases\n\n(Repeats Thursday's story with no changes to text)\n\n* India rates fall to $365-$370 a tonne from $368-$372\n\n* Bangladesh to provide $354 million subsidy to farmers\n\n* Thai rates narrow to $395-$400 a tonne on strong baht\n\n\n\nBy Sumita Layek\n\nBENGALURU, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Demand for rice from top\n\nexporter India was subdued as buyers delayed purchases despite a\n\ndip in prices to four-month lows this week, while restricted\n\nsupply kept rates for the Vietnamese variety at their highest in\n\ntwo months.\n\nPrices for India's 5 percent broken parboiled variety\n\nRI-INBKN5-P1 fell to $365-$370 per tonne from $368-$372 a week\n\nago.\n\n\"Asian and African buyers are not in a hurry. They are\n\npostponing buying anticipating a further fall in prices,\" said\n\nan exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra\n\nPradesh.\n\nIndia's rice exports in August fell 29% year-on-year to\n\n644,249 tonnes due to weak demand from African countries for\n\nnon-basmati rice, among other factors. Its rice production from\n\nthe summer-sown crop in 2019 is expected to drop 1.7% from a\n\nyear ago to 100.35 million tonnes. Meanwhile, rates for Vietnam's benchmark 5% broken rice\n\nRI-VNBKN5-P1 were unchanged from last week's $350 a tonne, a\n\ntwo-month high.\n\n\"Demand is weak, but low supplies have helped keep prices\n\nfrom falling,\" a trader based in the Mekong Delta province of An\n\nGiang said.\n\nHowever, there were concerns that a move by the Philippines\n\n-- Vietnam's largest rice export market accounting for 36% of\n\ntotal shipments -- to reduce imports could further hit the\n\nVietnamese market, another trader in Ho Chi Minh city said.\n\nSluggish demand pushed export prices for Vietnamese rice to\n\ntheir lowest in nearly 12 years, at $325 per tonne, in\n\nSeptember.\n\nA global economic slowdown has also been one of the factors\n\nweighing on demand, Vietnam's Deputy Minister of Agriculture and\n\nRural Development Phung Duc Tien told reporters this week.\n\nIn second biggest exporter Thailand, which has also been\n\ngrappling with slow demand and a strong baht, benchmark\n\n5-percent broken rice RI-THBKN5-P1 prices narrowed to\n\n$395-$400 a tonne on Thursday from $396-$400 last week.\n\n\"Demand has been very small because of our high prices and\n\nlittle else has changed,\" a Bangkok-based trader said.\n\nPrices for the Thai variety have remained higher than\n\ncompetitors due to the firm currency. THB=TH\n\n\"The continued strength of the baht has prevented exporters\n\nquoting lower prices as the market anticipates further\n\nstrengthening of the currency,\" another trader said.\n\nMeanwhile, farmers in Bangladesh, who have been struggling\n\nwith low prices and high harvesting costs, will receive a\n\nsubsidy of 30 billion taka ($354 million) to buy modern\n\nagro-tools in an effort to minimise production costs and boost\n\ndomestic output, Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque said.\n\nDhaka has failed to clinch overseas deals for its rice since\n\na long-standing export ban was lifted in May, losing out to\n\ncheaper grain from India and Thailand.\n\n\n\n($1 = 84.6900 taka)\n\n\n\n", "description": "RPT-Asia Rice-India prices hit multi-month lows as buyers defer purchases", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6T15I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
