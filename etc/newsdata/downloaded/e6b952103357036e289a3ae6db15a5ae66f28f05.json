We\u2019re out of pocket nearly \u00a3300 and we\u2019re cutting our holiday short if they do go bust.\u201d\n\nShe and her friend added that they hope to be reimbursed for the extra outlay, after three \u201cstressful\u201d days led them to make the contingency.\n\nIs Thomas Cook about to go bust? Your questions answered Read more\n\nTina Burgess, flying to Anatalya, Turkey from Manchester airport said she didn\u2019t sleep for 24 hours because of the uncertainty. \u201cIt\u2019s your summer vacation, time we\u2019ve booked off work together and who knew if we were going to fly or not?\n\nShe added, \u201cYou think Thomas Cook, you think British. They\u2019re actually global... they\u2019re a big group. You hope someone\u2019s going to come bail them out, but are they?\u201d\n\nHer husband, Steve Burgess, said that the uncertainty was the most worrying part of the situation. \u201cWe\u2019re going for two weeks \u2013 a lot can happen in two weeks.\u201d\n\nDayne Curwen from Manchester was also due to fly to Antalya. \u201cI\u2019m more worried about coming home,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about [the situation]. I\u2019ve just found out a couple of days ago. It\u2019s bang out of order. I thought Thomas Cook would have told us about this a couple of weeks ago, so I could have sorted other arrangements but they haven\u2019t done anything at all.\u201d\n\nA woman who was travelling to Lanzarote from Gatwick for a Thomas Cook package holiday in a group said that they hadn\u2019t spoken about Thomas Cook\u2019s potential plight since they did not want to worry their friend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite an important holiday for her, so we didn\u2019t want to worry her unless we needed to,\u201d she said, without providing her name. \u201cAs long as they can hang on another three hours and get us on this flight so we can get away then whatever happens on the other side will happen.\u201d\n\nOthers wished they had simply booked their holiday themselves rather than booking through the operator, referencing the company\u2019s slogan: \u201cDon\u2019t just book it, Thomas Cook it\u201d.\n\nBut travellers were primarily concerned with getting on their flight, and some said they would happily stay in Lanzarote if there were no flights back.\n\n\u201cAs long as we can get out there we can get back, even if we have to book another flight. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s our first holiday with our little girl so we just want to get out of the rain and get some sunshine,\u201d said Sam Longhurst from Surrey, at Gatwick. \u201cIt is what it is, shit happens.\u201d\n\nJane Byron, who lives near Heathrow but had travelled to Gatwick to fly to Lanzarote with her friend Jean Owen, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve checked in and hopefully we get back, if we don\u2019t, then we\u2019ve got friends out there.\u201d\n\nDarren and Jo McIver, flying to Tunisia to Manchester were also sanguine. \u201cC\u2019\u2019est la vie\u201d, Darren said.\n\nAn employee at the check in desk at Gatwick said everything was running as normal, while another asked for the latest news from the company\u2019s morning meeting at a City law firm.\n\nAsked about the progress of the talks, a Thomas Cook spokesperson said: \u201cNo comment.\u201d", "description": "UK check-in desks operating normally despite anxiety over risk of cancelled return flights", "authors": ["Mattha Busby", "Maya Wolfe-Robinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35496b52a5b22ec030d06bc39de753659ece8a37/0_258_3868_2321/master/3868.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=045f49e5c17e0e830bf354025f32d232", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
