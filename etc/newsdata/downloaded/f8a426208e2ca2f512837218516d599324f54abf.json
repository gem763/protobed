This reduced its net asset value by 3.4 pence per share.\n\nIH Holdings was one of WPCT\u2019s biggest holdings at end-April, the last month for which data is available, making up more than 10% of the portfolio. It delisted from the Guernsey stock exchange last month.\n\nAs of Sept. 11, the company\u2019s net asset value excluding income stood at 72.85 pence a share.", "description": "Woodford Patient Capital Trust , the listed trust run by under-fire money manager Neil Woodford, said its administrator Link Fund Solutions would cut the valuation of its stake in another of the company's holdings.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
