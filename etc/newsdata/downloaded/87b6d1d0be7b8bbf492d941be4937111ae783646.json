This prize is for three physician scientists who found the molecular switch that regulates how our cells adapt when oxygen levels drop,\u201d Randall Johnson of the Nobel Assembly told reporters.\n\nKaelin, 61, works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the US, while Semenza, 63, is director of the Vascular Research Program at the John Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering.\n\nRatcliffe, 65, is director of clinical research at the Francis Crick Institute in London, and director of the Target Discovery Institute in Oxford.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement opened an unusual 2019 Nobel season in which two literature laureates will be crowned after a scandal postponed last year\u2019s award.\n\nThe Peace Prize will be awarded in Oslo on Friday, with speculation rife that Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg could win for her campaign to raise awareness about climate change.\n\nExperts remain however divided on whether there is an actual link between armed conflicts and climate change.\n\nOther names circulating are Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who clinched a peace deal with arch foe Eritrea, and NGOs such as Reporters without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\n\u2013 Prize for lithium batteries? \u2013\n\nFor Tuesday\u2019s Physics Prize, Swedish daily DN suggested it could go to quantum physics research, citing US scientist John Clauser, Alain Aspect of France, and Austria\u2019s Anton Zeilinger.\n\nRonald Hanson of the Netherlands could win for his work on quantum entanglement, SR said.\n\nFor the Chemistry Prize, American John Goodenough, who invented lithium batteries, could become the oldest ever winner of a Nobel, at the age of 97.\n\nBut it could also go to two women, Emmanuelle Charpentier of France and Jennifer Doudna of the US, for the gene-editing technique known as the CRISPR-Cas9 DNA snipping tool, a type of genetic \u201cscissors\u201d used to cut out a mutated gene in a human embryo and replace it with a corrected version.\n\nChinese-born American Feng Zhang also claims to have discovered the technique.\n\n\u2013 Sexual harassment scandal \u2013\n\nLast year, the Swedish Academy which awards the Literature Prize was torn apart by a sexual harassment scandal that exposed deep conflicts among its 18 members. For the first time in 70 years, without a quorum to make key decisions, it postponed the 2018 Nobel by a year.\n\nAs a result, two literature laureates will be announced on Thursday, one for 2018 and one for 2019.\n\nThe Academy has spent the past year trying to address its issues and restore its honour, and is therefore seen to be steering clear of controversy in its picks.\n\nWriters who have been making a buzz include Poland\u2019s Olga Tokarczuk, Kenya\u2019s Ngugi Wa Thiong\u2019o, Ismail Kadare of Albania, Joyce Carol Oates of the US and Japan\u2019s Haruki Murakami, say critics questioned by AFP.\n\nThe Economics Prize will wrap things up on Monday, October 14. Three women have been mentioned as possible winners: Anne Krueger of the US for her work on international trade, Cuban-born American Carmen Reinhart for her work on public debt and growth, and French development aid economist Esther Duflo.", "description": "Stockholm (AFP) \u2013 Three researchers from the US and Britain on Monday shared the Nobel Medicine Prize for discoveries on how cells sense and adapt", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/106f74_william-kaelin-gregg-semenza-us-peter-ratcliffe-britain-announced-as-winners-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
