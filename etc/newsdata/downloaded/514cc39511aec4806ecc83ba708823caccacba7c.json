(Picture: Google Maps)\n\nThe statement continues to say: \u2018(Newell) is seen in the video covering their nose and mouth area with her hand.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewell had a profile on a widely used caregiver website, Care.com, according to Fox61.\n\nCare.com later released a statement saying: \u2018This incident is deeply disturbing to us and our thoughts are with the family.\n\n\u2018The individual in question did have a profile on Care.com which has now been closed.\u2019\n\nJudge Douglas Hogan sentenced Newell to a prison term \u2018not to exceed\u2019 five years, but ordered the sentence suspended.\n\nThat means jail time is contingent on whether Newell completes the other parts of her sentence.\n\nShe was also ordered to pay a $5,000 fine and will have to complete 500 hours of community service.\n\nHolt said: \u2018(Newell) lost her patience. She didn\u2019t deal with it in a healthy manner. I think that all of us as adults, we can be susceptible to that at times. It\u2019s not excusable and it\u2019s not okay, that\u2019s why we handled the case the way that we did.\u2019", "description": "McKenna Newell was sentenced to 30 days in jail for child abuse in Utah.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1570203948_1570218455.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
