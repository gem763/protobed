I sifted through reactions on political social media and it\u2019s already clear as can be that this is an unusually stark Trump Rorschach test even in an era where virtually everything in American politics is a Trump Rorschach test. If you\u2019re well disposed towards Trump, the transcript is a nothingburger. If you dislike him, the impeachment rocket has just lifted off. Case in point:\n\n\"I would like you to do us a favor\u2026\u201d Folks, I am surprised the White House even released this transcript. It\u2019s worse than we thought. The President sought to use the powers of the United States government to investigate a political opponent. We have no choice but to impeach. https://t.co/teZ8p83GXL \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 25, 2019\n\nPelosi sounds impeachment-minded this afternoon too:\n\n\u201cThe release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security. The President has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad. \u201cI respect the responsibility of the President to engage with foreign leaders as part of his job. It is not part of his job to use taxpayer money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign. Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities. \u201cThe transcript and the Justice Department\u2019s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President\u2019s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidates are also uniformly shocked and appalled, as you\u2019d expect. Longtime Trump friend turned enemy turned friend turned enemy Mitt Romney strongly disapproves too, although because he\u2019s a Republican he stops short of the I-word:\n\nMitt Romney says the transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian president is \"deeply troubling\": \"If the president of the United States asks or presses the leader of a foreign country to carry out an investigation of a political nature that's troubling\" https://t.co/4qoCdvO3CN pic.twitter.com/bKNcOKcZXi \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 25, 2019\n\nI expect the political class will spend the next few days debating what precisely Trump meant in the not-quite-transcript when Zelensky brought up U.S. missiles and Trump went on to mention a \u201cfavor.\u201d Ed argued in his post that in context the \u201cfavor\u201d refers exclusively to Trump\u2019s interest in Hillary\u2019s email server. Only after that did he bring up the Bidens. Philip Klein argues that \u201cfavor\u201d clearly refers to both \u2014 and, what\u2019s more, that these favors were obviously designed to benefit Trump politically, not the United States strategically:\n\nReading the full transcript, and understanding the broader context, it\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that Trump was using the power and influence of the U.S. to advance his own political interests rather than the national security interests of the nation. There was not much talk about what Ukraine could do for America\u2019s interests in the region, and a lot more talk about what he could do for Trump personally that would benefit him politically.\n\nOne point about the transcript that\u2019s been overlooked in the commentary I\u2019ve read is that Zelensky \u2014 not Trump \u2014 brings up Rudy Giuliani after Trump mentions CrowdStrike, assuring Trump that his assistant has already spoken to Rudy. Spoken to him about what? Here\u2019s the exchange.\n\nThere\u2019s some as yet unknown backdrop to this conversation about the \u201cfavor\u201d Trump wanted from Ukraine, which involved Giuliani and of which Zelensky was clearly already aware. What was it? Remember, Rudy had already openly declared his interest in pressuring Ukraine to reopen the Biden investigation back in May in a story in the NYT:\n\nMr. Giuliani said he plans to travel to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in the coming days and wants to meet with the nation\u2019s president-elect to urge him to pursue inquiries that allies of the White House contend could yield new information about two matters of intense interest to Mr. Trump. One is the origin of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. The other is the involvement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election, we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said in an interview on Thursday when asked about the parallel to the special counsel\u2019s inquiry. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper. And this isn\u2019t foreign policy \u2014 I\u2019m asking them to do an investigation that they\u2019re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I\u2019m going to give them reasons why they shouldn\u2019t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d\n\nAgain, this was two and a half months before Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. So here\u2019s Zelensky in July acknowledging that his people had already been in touch with Rudy, and per the excerpt above, we know that Rudy was keen to talk to them about the Biden probe. So maybe Trump didn\u2019t need to lean hard on Zelensky during the call \u2026 because Giuliani was already leaning hard on them behind closed doors. That is, if the defense to all this is that Trump never demanded a quid pro quo, that defense would be complicated if it turned out that *Giuliani* had demanded a quid pro quo privately on Trump\u2019s behalf, with the president\u2019s knowledge and blessing.\n\nWhich is how one would do something like this if one were intent on doing it, no? Why would Trump issue an ultimatum to Zelensky knowing that natsec aides were listening in on his call when he could have his loyal crony Rudy do it with no record of the threat being made?\n\nEither way, Trump did know that Giuliani was trying to reach out to them in May according to Rudy himself. Giuliani told the Times that month that \u201chis efforts in Ukraine have the full support of Mr. Trump.\u201d Per WaPo, officials inside the government are also irritated at Rudy\u2019s role in Ukraine diplomacy. \u201cRudy \u2014 he did all of this,\u201d said one official to the paper. \u201cThis s\u2014show that we\u2019re in \u2014 it\u2019s him injecting himself into the process.\u201d Interestingly, though, aides worried that Trump himself might pressure Zelensky improperly during a call and reportedly tried to keep them from making contact:\n\nThe sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments \u2014 all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani\u2019s activities from news reports. Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president\u2019s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump\u2019s political gain. As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump\u2019s potential rival in the 2020 race, former vice president Joe Biden, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nIn other words, even some people inside the building feared that Trump and possibly Giuliani were involved in an illicit influence campaign, or so WaPo\u2019s sources claim. But if Giuliani did demand a quid pro quo from Zelensky\u2019s government on Trump\u2019s behalf, how could House Democrats possibly prove it? Rudy will deny it, of course, and the Ukrainians certainly won\u2019t risk Trump\u2019s wrath by acknowledging it.\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, one other point to note about the Romney clip up top. Romney is asked about a quid pro quo and dismisses it as borderline irrelevant, which is the least Trump-friendly way of framing the issue here. Most Republicans insist that, absent an explicit threat to withhold military aid unless Zelensky played ball on the Biden probe, there was no wrongdoing. Romney counters by saying that it doesn\u2019t matter if there was a threat or not. Merely *requesting* an investigation of an American political rival that would benefit you electorally is \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d even if it\u2019s no more than a request. That\u2019s the same argument Dems will make (and are already making) if they impeach Trump.
