Peugeot 306 GTI-6 (1996-2001)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a31,000\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Electrical & suspension issues\n\nThe 306 GTI-6 was built in very limited numbers and is already beginning to be recognised as a future collectible\n\nThe Peugeot 205 GTI is the small French hot hatch to have right now, having built a cult following when they were new from the mid-1980s.\n\nToday, these little pocket rockets are worth a respective fortune, with prices for the lowest mileage cars exceeding \u00a325,000.\n\nMany now suspect the 306 GTI-6 - which proved a more natural successor to the 205 than the 206 GTI - is heading that way, too. Decent 306 GTI-6s can be found on eBay for around \u00a31,000.\n\nThis is Money says: The 306 GTI-6 might not be at he same level of appreciation as the 205 GTI, but rarity should help values. Finding a good one is a difficulty.\n\nModern classic likelihood: 5/5\n\n2, Audi A2 (1999-2005)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a31,500\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Engine & electrical issues\n\nThe A2's space-age looks and ahead-of-its-time design wasn't hugely appreciated when it was new, but that's changing now\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say this compact Audi was slightly ahead of its time, and as a result wasn't much of a sales hit when it was new.\n\nThat's good news for owners, because they\u2019re now becoming fairly rare.\n\nAnd because it combines space-age looks with clever engineering involving lots of weight-saving aluminium, it\u2019s gained a lot of fans.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty economical too, though does have a few quirks that still don't make much sense today - namely an odd bonnet system that means you need to remove it entirely to access the engine bay. The 1.6 FSI petrol variant is the one to look for.\n\nThis is Money says: Those who did buy an A2 found they were a relatively reliable workhorse, which means that most have done big mileage. Find one with a relatively small figure on the odometer and you'll be laughing.\n\nModern classic likelihood: 4/5\n\n3. Alfa Romeo 159 Sportwagon (2006 - 2012)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a32,500\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Suspension issues\n\nThe Alfa Romeo 159 Sportswagon is a handsome car that was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro - the same man who penned the DMC DeLorean\n\nSome cars become collectible because of how they drive, but there are others that increase in desirability as appreciation for their looks heightens.\n\nThis is definitely the case for the Alfa Romeo 159 Sportwagon.\n\nIt was created by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro, the same man who brought us Back To The Future\u2019s DMC DeLorean.\n\nMotorEasy says you need to look out for suspension issues, though given this era was notorious for Alfa Romeo foibles, we'd also recommend making sure the electrics are operating as they should.\n\nThis is Money says: There's no denying the 159 was very pretty, but it's the 156 Sportswagon - especially the fire-breathing 3.2-litre V6 GTA versoin - that is more desirable.\n\nFuture classic likelihood: 2/5\n\n4. MG F (1995-2002)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a31,500\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Engine & electrical issues\n\nHead-gasket failures plagued the MG F, but find a well maintained one at it could have some value\n\nDrop top sports cars have historically been contenders for future classics - and British ones are even more sought after.\n\nAnd while the MG F has its detractors, public opinion appears to be changing on these little British cars - and prices are currently at an all time low.\n\nThe MG F is fitted with a 1.8 litre \u2018K Series\u2019 engine sourced from Rover. And these engines can be prone to head gasket failures. However, get a good one, and the MGF is a real driver\u2019s car.\n\nThis is Money says: Specialist firms have been buying them up in recent years, meaning prices could soon go up, but the best examples are likely to have had the right people maintaining them.\n\nFuture classic likelihood: 3/5\n\n5. VW Beetle V5 Sport (2000-2005)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a32,000\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Suspension & electrical issues\n\nThe reborn Beetle never won the majority of people over, and it could be some time before they're desirable to collectors\n\nWhen Volkswagen reintroduced the \u2018new' Beetle to the market in 1997, seemingly dull styling made sure it was unloved. But it\u2019s tough to kill an icon.\n\nAnd when VW called time on the Beetle for good in July this year, interest in the old models was suddenly rekindled.\n\nThe one you want is the 2.3 V5 Sport Edition - which is rare, and quick.\n\nThink of it as the alternative to the VW Golf GTi of the same era, but in seriously limited numbers.\n\nThis is Money says: The reborn Beetle never really delivered, and we still think there's some time until a fanbase for them establishes. Buy one now on the cheap and it could be a reliable late bloomer.\n\nFuture classic likelihood: 3/5\n\n6. Fiat Coupe (1993-2000)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a32,500\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Suspension & engine issues\n\nThe Fiat Coupe offered Ferrari-like looks in an affordable package with a relatively big powerplant given its size. Most were thrashed under ownership\n\nWith its Ferrari-esque looks, prices for Fiat Coupe have been slowly creeping up in recent years.\n\nAnd now might be your last chance to get your hands on one before they become too expensive - with quality examples being sold for \u00a310,000 plus.\n\nThe 20v Turbo models hold their value best and cost the most.\n\nEngine issues can be common. This is mostly down to the fact they were relatively affordable in the day so many who bought them chose to thrash them.\n\nThis is Money says: Finding one that hasn't been abused or terribly modified is going to take Sherlock-like investigatory skills. There can't be many sound originals in existence.\n\nFuture classic likelihood: 5/5\n\n7. Saab 9-3 Turbo X (2008-2009)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a36,500\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Suspension, engine & electrical issues\n\nSaab soon folded after the arrival of the 9-3 Turbo X, which could play into current owners' hands as they have future classic potential\n\nWhen the Swedish firm folded in 2012, hardened Saab fans wept.\n\nAnd with the cars now something of a collector\u2019s item, the rarest Saabs are sure to hold their value.\n\nThe 9-3 Turbo X fits the bill perfectly, featuring a four-wheel-drive system married to a 2.8L, 276bhp engine.\n\nWhen the brand pulled operations from the UK it also took most of the aftercare service with it. So make sure you check the record of models to make sure they were maintained by specialists.\n\nThis is Money says: Rarity is key with these, though the only problem is they haven't depreciated as much as other cars here.\n\nFuture classic likelihood: 4/5\n\n8. Citroen Saxo VTS (1997-2003)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a31,500\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Suspension & gearbox issues\n\nThe Citroen Saxo VTS was the early 2000s boy racer's car of choice. Many were abused, modified or mangled in crashes as a result\n\nThe Saxo VTS was the epitome of affordable hot hatches in the late '90s.\n\nIt was the range topping Saxo, which came with a punchy 16-valve, 1.6-litre petrol engine and bags of personality.\n\nThey were immensely popular with enthusiastic young motorists in the day - which means they were often thrashed and commonly crashed.\n\nThat said the very same drivers will be looking to relive their youth by putting their hands in their pockets in the years to come.\n\nThis is Money says: There's a difference between the hot hatches from the '80s and '90s to those of the 2000s. Examples from the latter era, like the Saxo VTS, were 'warm' hatches, so we're not sure if they will be as appreciated nostalgically.\n\nFuture classic likelihood: 2/5\n\n9. Skoda Fabia vRS (2003-2007)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a31,800\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Suspension & electrical issues\n\nA diesel hot hatch was relatively unheard of until the little Fabia vRS came along. It had performance and frugality in spades\n\nWhen the Fabia vRS first hit showrooms, the only option you had was to get it with a 1.9 litre diesel engine.\n\nThat's rare for a small car with hot hatch pretenses.\n\nPetrol engines only came with more modern versions of the vRS.\n\nBut that decision means the original vRS is now a much sought-after car, considered by many to be one of the most un-sung hot hatches going.\n\nThis is Money says: Everyone hates diesel right now, which won't help current values. Will people look back at an oil-burning warm hatch fondly in the future? We're not entirely convinced.\n\nFuture classic likelihood: 2/5\n\n10. Ford Puma (1997-2001)\n\nAvailable from: \u00a31,000\n\nMotorEasy says to watch out for: Cooling & heating system, braking system issues\n\nThe Puma Racing is the model that's already a future classic, but numbers were rare and prices are through the roof. A good 1.7-litre example could be a good bet\n\nIn June this year Ford revealed its latest Puma - a chunky looking SUV. That model is a million miles away from the original Puma, released in 1997.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the old model which many are tipping for future classic status.\n\nThe appeal is in the dynamics of the handling, with the Puma seemingly defying the laws of physics at times.\n\nSporty Racing Pumas are already going for \u00a315,000, but the standard versions can be had for a whole lot less. The 1.7-litre version is the one to choose if you can't stretch to the rally-inspired Racing variant.\n\nThis is Money says: Puma Racing models are already well out of the budget, but a good 1.7-litre model in original condition is the next best thing and - kept well - should increase in value.\n\nFuture classic likelihood: 4/5", "description": "Want a crystal ball for collectible cars?
