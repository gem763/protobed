The dress is no longer available online.\n\nThe duchess previously wore the dress for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding rehearsal at Windsor Castle last year.\n\nWilliam opted for a navy jacket, a light blue shirt and brown slacks. Both parents coordinated with their kids\u2019 cute navy-and-red school uniforms.\n\n\u201cFirst day! She\u2019s very excited,\u201d William told the lower school\u2019s head teacher, Helen Haslem, according to the Evening Standard. Charlotte waved on her way into school and hid behind her mom\u2019s legs at one point.\n\nThe 4-year-old princess will join the ranks of other famous alumni who\u2019ve attended the private preparatory school, including Cara Delevingne and singer Florence Welch.\n\nWhile at school, Charlotte, whose full name is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge, will go by the name Charlotte Cambridge.\n\nWPA Pool via Getty Images The little one was holding on tight to her mom.\n\nAARON CHOWN via Getty Images Princess Charlotte waving as she heads to school.\n\nAARON CHOWN via Getty Images Charlotte is greeted by Helen Haslem, head of the lower school, on her arrival for her first day of school at Thomas's Battersea in London on Sept. 5.\n\nEarlier this year, George\u2019s curriculum at the prestigious school ended up making headlines after \u201cGood Morning America\u201d co-anchor Lara Spencer mocked the young prince for taking ballet, which he has for some time.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the usual first- or second-grade things, like math, science and history, the future King of England will be putting down the Play-Doh to take on religious studies, computer programming, poetry and ballet, among other things,\u201d Spencer said during an Aug. 22 segment. Her co-hosts laughed, along with the crowd, when Spencer emphasized the word \u201cballet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince William says George absolutely loves ballet,\u201d she went on. \u201cI have news for you, Prince William: We\u2019ll see how long that lasts.\u201d Spencer later apologized on Instagram and on the air after furious backlash. \u201cI screwed up. I did,\u201d she said in her on-camera apology. \u201cThe comment I made about dance was insensitive, it was stupid and I am deeply sorry.\u201d This article has been republished with further information about Spencer and Prince George.", "description": "The duchess previously wore the Michael Kors look to Meghan Markle's wedding rehearsal.", "authors": ["Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d711bbb240000fb1775f5cd.jpeg?cache=tnbwek0ljs&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
