I'd wash my hands maybe 60 times a day, with very hot water, burning them. It looked like I was wearing red gloves and was very embarrassing and painful.\n\n\"I began losing the ability to rationalise, gargling two bottles of Listerine a day until I had mouth ulcers.\n\n\"There were other things, like I'd brush my teeth 30 times a day and it would take me 90 minutes to get ready in the morning because I was getting changed five times.\n\n\"Over the course of a few months, I had totally lost control of my life.\"\n\n(Image: Ben Jeffreys)\n\nFriends and family had no idea the extent to which he suffered from the condition but his wife Andraya gradually became aware.\n\n\"She would have to go to the shop to restock on toothpaste and mouthwash. I must have spent hundreds on those products,\" he said.\n\n\"She would see this happening to me, but I was in a place where I had no belief or desire to get myself out of it.\n\n\"But after a while it would become harder to hide it as my weight dropped to 9st. I was always much heavier than that. Eating became so difficult because I found it impossible to use cutlery or my bare hands.\n\n\"I was finding novel ways, such as 'drinking' crisps from a cup, using paper towels to eat sandwiches and buying disposable paper plates for every meal.\"\n\nWhen Andraya became seriously ill towards the end of 2012 with endometriosis - where the lining of the womb is found outside the uterus - he said he \"became her carer\".\n\n\"She was wasting away before my eyes. When she became ill I then became even more vigilant with my own hygiene and eating habits.\"\n\nOn Easter Sunday 2013 Ben collapsed at home from exhaustion.\n\n\"I was taken by ambulance to hospital where they discovered that my blood pressure was through the roof. I was completely shot mentally.\n\n\"That was the moment when I began to seriously consider getting some treatment. I didn't want to live with this condition anymore.\"\n\nJust before his father suffered the stroke, he had saved Pontypool RFC - the club he had supported as a boy - from liquidation.\n\n\"He made the decision to pay off all outstanding debts and take full control of the club,\" Ben added.\n\n\"Unfortunately, in the weeks following his decision he suffered a stroke which left him unable to work.\"\n\n(Image: NCRphotography)\n\nBen also underwent cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which taught him to live with his OCD and manage it successfully.\n\n\"I had to put myself in uncomfortable places. I would pick up sweets and eat them with my bare hands and would work on that for several weeks. Then I'd pick up something else.\n\n\"I cannot get rid of the intrusive images that come with OCD, but I can learn to live with them.\n\n\"Asking for help should be nothing to be ashamed of whatsoever. I don't feel like I need to hide my condition anymore. I led a double-life for so long.\"\n\nSuicide is also the biggest killer for men under 50 in the UK and globally it is responsible for 800,000 deaths which equates to one suicide every 40 seconds.\n\nAhead of World Mental Health Day on Thursday, October 10, Time to Change Wales is striving to end the stigma and discrimination surrounding mental health.\n\nLowri Wyn Jones, Time to Change Wales programme manager, said: \u201cOur aim is to get as many people to feel comfortable enough to talk about their mental health by opening up to friends, family and colleagues so that we avoid crisis situations such as contemplating suicide.\n\n\"World Mental Health Day is about opening a dialog on self-care, prevention and raising awareness of mental health problems.\n\n\"We need to take far more collective responsibility for managing our own mental health and wellbeing by taking small steps such as checking in on someone, or providing a listening ear which can be a lifeline for someone who is experiencing difficulties.\"\n\nBen, who is a Time to Change Wales ambassador, also raised \u00a32,000 for the mental health charity Mind after running the Cardiff Half Marathon.\n\nFor more details on Time to Change Wales visit timetochangewales.org.uk\n\nFor confidential support, the Samaritans can be contacted for free around the clock 365 days a year on 116 123.", "description": "Ben Jeffreys, from Newport, Wales, said he was driven to the brink of suicide as he battled debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)", "authors": ["Mark Smith", "Image", "Ncrphotographyltd", "Ben Jeffreys", "Ncrphotography"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20549740.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_I-brushed-my-teeth-30-times-a-day-and-gargled-with-two-bottles-of-mouthwashBen-Jeffreys-the-chie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
