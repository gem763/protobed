The cost of borrowing declined to near-historic lows in August following the Fed\u2019s decision to cut its bench-market interest for the first time in a decade, triggering a flurry of home buyer.\n\n\n\nMore: \u2018Black Friday\u2019 of U.S. Real Estate is Next Week\n\nBut strong activity in August had a muted effect on home prices, as fears of an economic slowdown continue to weigh on the market, according to Redfin\u2019s chief economist Daryl Fairweather.\n\n\n\nThe median home price rose to $312,200 in August, a modest 2.7% increase from a year ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cGlobal economic uncertainty and talk of a looming recession in the U.S. are staving off many aspects of a hot seller\u2019s market\u2014think bidding wars, fast sales and huge price escalations\u2014at least for now,\u201d Ms. Fairweather said in the report.\n\n\n\nA seller\u2019s market could be on the horizon, however. The National Association of Realtors, which put out its own report on August sales on Thursday, said that low supply may cause prices to climb out of buyers\u2019 reach if sales activity remains high.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Basquiat\u2019s Works to Headline Major Auctions During Frieze London\n\n\u201cSales are up, but inventory numbers remain low and are thereby pushing up home prices,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist. \u201cHomebuilders need to ramp up new housing, as the failure to increase construction will put home prices in danger of increasing at a faster pace than income.\u201d\n\n\n\nHigh demand for mortgages, which precede closings, point to growing home sales over the next few months, according to a note from Pantheon Macroeconomics on Thursday. By early 2020, Pantheon said, U.S. home sales could reach a \u201cnew post-crash high.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-108849?size=1.4988290398126465&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
