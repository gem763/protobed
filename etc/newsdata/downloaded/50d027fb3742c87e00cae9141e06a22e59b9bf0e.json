The South Carolina Republican is a top ally of Trump. Giuliani has also served as an emissary to Ukraine.\n\nTrump is accused of seeking to strong-arm Ukraine into opening an investigation into Trump\u2019s political rival, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.\n\nGraham said on Twitter that he wants testimony about the firing of a former Ukrainian prosecutor who was widely seen by the West as corrupt.\n\n___\n\n9:55 a.m.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says the failure of a State Department official to show up at a deposition Tuesday as part of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation is \u201cyet additional strong evidence\u201d of obstruction of Congress.\n\nThe Trump administration barred Gordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, from closed-door testimony as several committees are investigating President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with the president of Ukraine.\n\nText messages released last week revealed conversations between Sondland and other U.S. diplomats who were intermediaries as Trump urged Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden\u2019s family and the 2016 election.\n\nSchiff and other Democrats have said that they will consider such obstruction if they draft articles of impeachment against the president.\n\n___\n\n9:45 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he\u2019d \u201clove\u201d to send Ambassador Gordon Sondland to testify before Congress but doing so would put him before \u201ca totally compromised kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Sondland says the State Department directed his client not to appear for a scheduled interview Tuesday before a joint House committee taking depositions in the impeachment probe of the Republican president.\n\nTrump says in a tweet the \u201ctrue facts are not allowed out for the public.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo (pahm-PAY\u2019-oh) has ignored a shouted question about Sondland during a photo op with the visiting foreign minister of Estonia.\n\nHouse Democrats are looking into Trump\u2019s handling of U.S. relations with Ukraine and his desire for Ukraine to investigate potential Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden. Trump has denied doing anything wrong.\n\n___\n\n8:25 a.m.\n\nAn attorney for Ambassador Gordon Sondland says the State Department has directed Sondland not to appear for his scheduled interview before a joint House committee taking depositions in the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump.\n\nSondland is wrapped up in the congressional impeachment inquiry and had previously agreed to appear voluntarily Tuesday to answer the committee\u2019s questions in a closed session.\n\nSondland attorney Robert Luskin says that as the sitting U.S. ambassador to the European Union and an employee of the State Department, Sondland is required to follow the department\u2019s direction. No reason for the direction was cited, he said.\n\nLuskin says Sondland \u201cis profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify.\u201d\n\nLuskin says Sondland \u201cbelieves strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States.\u201d\n\n___\n\n12:10 a.m.\n\nAn envoy wrapped up in a congressional impeachment inquiry was a late convert to President Donald Trump, initially supporting another candidate in the Republican primary and once refusing to participate in a fundraiser on his behalf.\n\nBut Gordon Sondland nonetheless donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s election effort and ultimately scored a plum post as U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nNow, a whistleblower\u2019s complaint and text messages released by another envoy portray Sondland as a potentially important witness to allegations the Republican president sought to dig up dirt on rival Joe Biden in the name of foreign policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sondland is scheduled to head to Capitol Hill to face questions about the episode.\n\nUntil last week, Sondland was far better known in his home state of Washington than in the nation\u2019s capital.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on envoy Gordon Sondland's scheduled testimony on Capitol Hill (all times local): 10:30 a.m. The chairman of the Senate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/64c653_trump-impeachment-38397-donald-trump-gordon-sondland-in-tuesday-10-2018-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
