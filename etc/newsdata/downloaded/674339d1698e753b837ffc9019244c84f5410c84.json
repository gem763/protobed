Still, not shipping the phone in India is somewhat strange, given that Google is planning to launch the device in Japan without Motion Sense features, which won\u2019t be arriving on devices in that country until \u201cspring 2020,\u201d per a Google support page.\n\n\u201cWe decided not to make Pixel 4 available in India,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement to Gadgets360. \u201cGoogle has a wide range of products that we make available in different regions around the world. We determine availability based on a variety of factors, including local trends, and product features.\u201d\n\nGiven that the Indian smartphone market is largely dominated by cheaper devices from companies like Samsung, Xiaomi, and Vivo, pricier flagship devices like Apple\u2019s iPhones or Google\u2019s Pixels tend to struggle to make an impact. Add in the prospect that an Indian model would have to miss out on the Pixel 4\u2019s new marquee features, and it\u2019s easy to see how Google decided to simply skip out a launch entirely.\n\nIt\u2019s not the end of Pixel devices in India, though: Google\u2019s spokesperson added that the company is still \u201ccommitted to [its] current Pixel phones and look[s] forward to bringing future Pixel devices to India.\u201d But if you\u2019re a Pixel fan in India, you\u2019ll likely have to look elsewhere for a new phone this fall.", "description": "Google\u2019s recently announced Pixel 4 is reportedly skipping out on a launch in India \u2014 one of the largest phone markets in the world \u2014 due to a spectrum licensing issue with the Motion Sense radar technology that powers the phone\u2019s gesture and face unlocking features.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PmMK37ecKuHf0tR4EbOjXT6VHH0=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19282486/vpavic_191010_3730_0084.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
