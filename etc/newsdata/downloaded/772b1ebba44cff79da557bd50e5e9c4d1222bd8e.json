The welcome news of the High Court ruling is thanks to the brave campaigning of Sarah Ewart \u2013 a woman who was refused an abortion in the region \u2013 even when it was clear that her pregnancy was not viable.\n\nThose who seek to keep abortion restricted in Northern Ireland would rather women like Sarah put their own lives at risk. They also show little consideration for the women forced to carry a foetus to term knowing that it will not survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah called her landmark case a turning point for women fighting outdated laws \u2013 and we stand with her.\n\nAnti-choice campaigners may claim to care about \u2018unborn children\u2019, but time and again it becomes clear that they are driven purely by the desire to victimise and control women.\n\nThis is evidenced by the harassment of Stella Creasy by the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform (CBRUK), the British arm of notorious American anti-choice group who are in favour of forced pregnancies.\n\nSarah called her landmark case a turning point for women fighting outdated laws \u2013 and we stand with her (Picture: PAUL FAITH/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nStella, who is pregnant, said she felt \u2018physically sick\u2019 when she saw her picture blown up next to a graphic image of what was claimed to be a \u201924-week-old dead baby girl\u2019 in Walthamstow.\n\nCBRUK\u2019s position that \u2018abortion represents an evil\u2019, is so abhorrent that words fail us. When attempting to describe its horror, all that can be said is that they\u2019re woefully out of step with public opinion.\n\nAccording to the British Social Attitudes Survey, there is significant support for a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nIt revealed 93 per cent of the British public support abortion when the pregnant person\u2019s health is endangered, while 70 per cent support it if the woman does not want a child.\n\nBut these pressure groups are becoming worryingly active in the UK.\n\nOften funded by far-right American anti-choice groups and wealthy donors, they have the cash at their disposal to mobilise the anti-choice minority to mimic US harassment campaigns outside clinics across the UK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile some councils have introduced buffer zones to ensure that women are able to safely access essential healthcare free from intimidation, this has yet to be replicated across the rest of the country.\n\nWhen MPs are being harassed at work, women are being intimidated in the street and people seeking abortions in the UK are threatened with a life sentence in prison for taking an abortion pill they bought online, it couldn\u2019t be clearer why I \u2013 and plenty of other activists \u2013 are fighting for a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the big bucks that the anti-choice movement have but we will keep on fighting for abortion rights.\n\nMake a donation to Abortion Rights here.\n\nMORE: Pregnant MP targeted by anti-abortion campaigners with \u2018sickening\u2019 dead baby poster\n\nMORE: Advertiser vows to pull down anti-abortion ad aimed at local MP\n\nMORE: More than 1,000 women travelled from Northern Ireland for abortions last year", "description": "An anti-choice group harassed an MP with posters and the High Court ruled Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws breach the UK\u2019s human right commitments.", "authors": ["Kerry Abel", "Chair Of The Abortion Rights Campaign"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRC_87477498_1570361272.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
