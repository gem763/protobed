BoJack Horseman uses Princess Carolyn\u2019s story line to interrogate the seeming impossibility of work-life balance for many women\u2014and for working mothers in particular. Though it focuses on a character with relative financial comfort and career stability, \u201cThe New Client\u201d effortlessly weaves Princess Carolyn\u2019s struggles into the show\u2019s ongoing critique of the capitalist entertainment industry. In the past, BoJack has taken aim at greedy studio executives, mega-conglomerates, and wealthy celebrities, and the new episode also nods to the recent writers\u2019 strikes that have shaken up Hollywood.\n\nWhile BoJack\u2019s satire of broken institutions can be broad and allegorical, \u201cThe New Client\u201d takes a more individual approach to Princess Carolyn\u2019s situation. As it has in the past, the series communicates an element of her interiority\u2014her simultaneous weariness and desire to be a superwoman\u2014with inventive animation. In Season 5, a conflict mediator described Princess Carolyn as a \u201ctangled fog of pulsating yearning in the shape of a woman,\u201d after which the show depicted the cat as a hologram composed of yarn to represent her conflicting desires. In some of the new season\u2019s most affecting scenes, BoJack shows Princess Carolyn literally fragmenting herself to get through her daily routine: One shadow figure completes menial tasks, another answers business calls, and one comforts the crying baby.\n\nThese colorful apparitions first materialize the morning after the nanny quits, when Princess Carolyn is forced to bring her infant daughter to work. The silent, dutiful efficiency of each shadow cat is jarring, especially when juxtaposed with the original character\u2019s obvious exhaustion. The effect is amplified by the episode\u2019s sound design: Princess Carolyn shakes a maraca to calm her baby; the baby wails; the phone rings. Overlaid onto one another and looped, the noises meld into an overwhelming, disorienting cacophony.\n\nThe result is a multidimensional portrait of Princess Carolyn\u2019s fatigue, and of the unreasonable demands made of working mothers. BoJack organically builds on its thoughtful treatment of a character whose story lines skew tragic: For example, a Season 4 episode titled \u201cRuthie\u201d reflected on Princess Carolyn\u2019s then-implausible quest to become a mother by fast-forwarding her journey into the distant future. That episode also foreshadowed the eventual name of her baby, who spends much of \u201cThe New Client\u201d being called \u201cUntitled Princess Carolyn Project\u201d because the agent hasn\u2019t had the time or mental bandwidth to properly christen her.\n\n\n\nReferring to a child as a \u201cproject\u201d might sound cold or distant, even if the baby\u2019s confusing moniker plays into an amusing B-plot. Like the episode\u2019s title, though, the interim name offers insight into one way a woman like Princess Carolyn might begin to make sense of her new maternal responsibilities\u2014by thinking of the baby in terms that feel more intuitive to her. At the Manatee Fair photo shoot, another woman uses a technology metaphor to explain the secret to her success. \u201cI just think of myself as having multiple apps running at the same time,\u201d she says. \u201cI have my mom app, and my career app, and my wife app, and my yoga-body app, and they\u2019re all just constantly going, all the time.\u201d Though her voice cracks as she speaks, she attempts to project a polished image for the other women in the room.", "description": "In its final season, the Netflix series inventively captures the fatigue\u2014and guilt\u2014that many working mothers experience.", "authors": ["Hannah Giorgis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/BoJack_Horseman_S06E02_6m59s10069f_1/facebook.jpg?1572036099", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
