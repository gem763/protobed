The contracts don't necessarily predict movements after the opening bell.\n\nThe Fed on Tuesday had to step in to address a problem in money markets. It was the first time since 2008 that the central bank had to inject cash to keep interest rates down for short-term borrowing, and it is unclear how long the market intervention will last.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the Fed said it would inject a further $75 billion Wednesday morning to ease the cost of overnight borrowing.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.1% in morning trading after a mixed session in Asia. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.3% and Korea's Kospi gained 0.4%, while Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.2%.\n\nJapan's exports dropped 8.2% on year last month, a more rapid fall than expected, adding to speculation that the central bank may seek to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory. The weak data came as global uncertainty has boosted the yen, regarded as a haven by investors, by around 1.4% against the U.S. dollar so far this year.\n\nGlobal oil benchmark Brent crude slipped 0.7% to $64.09 on Wednesday, following days of sharp swings after an attack on production facilities in Saudi Arabia. The tick downward came after the Saudi energy ministry said the kingdom would recover output in weeks.\n\nThe attack caused the Brent price to rise 15% on Monday, the biggest leap in a single day since 1988, before dropping back by 6.5% on Tuesday. The volatility spread to other asset types, including junk bonds. Energy firms account for about 6% of debt outstanding in the high-yield market.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve later Wednesday is expected to cut its short-term benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, following a cut of the same amount in July. The central bank is seeking to balance domestic concerns, such as a relatively tight labor market, against a slowdown in global trade.\n\n\"Whatever has happened in the last week or two hasn't changed my view that there will be 25 basis-point cut today. To not introduce a cut would introduce volatility to the market that it can't afford,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.\n\nAfter its Wednesday meeting, the Fed is also expected to release more details on the likely future course of interest rates.\n\nData on construction in the U.S. will also be released Wednesday. The figures for August follow three straight months of declines in the number of homes being built.\n\nThe yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys ticked down to 1.767%, from 1.805% Tuesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise. Gold prices slipped 0.2%.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 18, 2019 06:04 ET (10:04 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
