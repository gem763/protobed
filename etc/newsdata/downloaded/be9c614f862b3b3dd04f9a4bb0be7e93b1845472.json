Called me limp and useless. I was not performing very well.\n\n\u2018Marie was at this point raging, absolutely raging, finger pointing, screaming. She then slapped me across the face.\n\n\u2018Er, I remember reaching out, grabbing her hood and \u2026 I don\u2019t remember.\n\n\u2018I was standing at the side of her body. There was blood on my hands and the crowbar. She was on the floor.\u2019\n\nHe bludgeoned his wife at the stables where they kept their horses (Picture: Google Maps)\n\nDefensive injuries to his victim\u2019s hands and arms were found as his wife covered her head to try to avoid the blows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetective Inspector Adam Waller, of Cheshire Police, said: \u2018This case was truly shocking and one of the biggest investigations the constabulary has seen in recent years.\n\n\u2018The injuries sustained by Ann Marie were horrific and all those involved in this investigation were determined to find her killer and ensure they were brought to justice for their actions.\n\n\u2018What Pomphret did that day ripped a family apart and he will now have to face the consequences of that behind bars.\n\n\u2018I hope that, whilst it won\u2019t bring Ann Marie back, seeing justice being done will help them in some way.\u2019\n\nJudge David Aubrey told Pomphret he would set the minimum term before the defendant is eligible for parole when he passes sentence next Tuesday.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
