REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nTORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, with the currency losing some of its recent positive momentum as oil prices fell and domestic data showed a surprise drop in August wholesale trade.\n\nCanadian wholesale trade decreased by 1.2% in August from July on weaker sales in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector, as well as personal and household goods, Statistics Canada said. Analysts had forecast a 0.3% increase.\n\nThe price of oil, one of Canada\u2019s major exports, slipped on data showing a bigger-than-expected rise in U.S. crude stocks. U.S. crude oil futures were down 1.3% at $53.75 a barrel.\n\nAt 9:23 a.m. (1323 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3095 to the greenback, or 76.37 U.S. cents. The currency, which notched a three-month high on Tuesday at 1.3071, traded in a narrow range of 1.3088 to 1.3109.\n\nThe steady profile for the loonie came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party won Monday\u2019s federal election but fell short of a majority government.\n\nInvestors are ditching bets that the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates over the coming months as the domestic economy shows resilience and the federal election result adds to prospects of growth-boosting fiscal spending next year.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s next interest rate decision is due on Oct. 30, the same day that markets expect the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. rates for the third time since July. That could lower the range for the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate below the equivalent rate for the Bank of Canada of 1.75%.\n\nCanadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve, with the two-year up 4.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.602% and the benchmark 10-year rising 20 Canadian cents to yield 1.498%.\n\nThe 10-year yield hit its lowest since Oct. 15 at 1.484%.", "description": "The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, with the currency losing some of its recent positive momentum as oil prices fell and domestic data showed a surprise drop in August wholesale trade.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444127386&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M19J-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
