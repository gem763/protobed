He would tell me these stories, but I didn't know the extent to which he tried to save other people, the way he was actually working to help not just himself, but others as well. And I really got that from the diary.\"\n\nRenia's Diary: A Young Girl's Life in the Shadow of the Holocaust hits shelves on Sept. 29.\n\nWho was Renia?\n\nRenia was a born in 1924 to an upper middle class family in southeastern Poland. In 1939, at the age of 15, she began keeping a diary.\n\nShe and her little sister Ariana were staying with their grandparents in the southern city of Przemysl when the Germans and Soviets divided Poland, separating the girls from their parents.\n\nRenia Spiegel often wrote in her diary about her boyfriend Zygmunt Schwarzer, pictured here in 1941. (Submitted by Schwarzer)\n\n\"I just want a friend. I want somebody to talk to about my everyday worries and joys. Somebody who would feel what I feel, who would believe me, who would never reveal my secrets,\" she wrote in her first entry, quoted on Smithsonian.com.\n\n\"A human being can never be such a friend and that's why I have decided to look for a confidant in the form of a diary.\"\n\nShe would continue to document her thoughts and feelings for the next three years as she came of age under the rule of two occupying forces, until she was ultimately killed by the Nazis at the age of 18.\n\nLove and war\n\nOver and over, Renia wrote about her relationship with Zygmunt, a member of the resistance.\n\n\"I think for her, he becomes this conduit to the outside world. She's very inward. She's reflecting on herself and her friends, and she's writing poetry and yet she's not really venturing out much,\" Schwarzer said.\n\n\"And he's the kind of outside world, he's going all around the town and into the environs securing food, making connections, helping people.\"\n\nRenia Spiegel's diary has been translated to English in its entirely for the first time. (St. Martin's Press)\n\nAs their romance blossomed, the war intensified. They shared their first kiss on June 20, 1941, just two days before the Germans declared war on the Soviet Union and advanced into eastern Poland.\n\nJust over a year later, in July 1942, she was forced into a ghetto.\n\n\"Today at 8 o'clock we have been shut away in the ghetto,\" she wrote. \"I live here now; the world is separated from me, and I'm separated from the world.\"\n\n'Three shots! Three lives lost!'\n\nZygmunt came to her rescue \u2014 or, at least, he tried to.\n\n\"My father knew based on experience from what was going on elsewhere, because he was in contact with people and with the resistance, that once the ghetto was established, that's basically a convenient holding pen so that the German SS can then round up Jews and take them either to a massacre site in the forest or to an extermination camp,\" Schwarzer said.\n\nWith the help of the resistance, he was able to sneak Renia and Ariana out of the ghetto.\n\nAriana, just 12 at the time, went to live with a friend's father, while Renia went into hiding with Zygmunt's parents in the attic of his uncle's house. She gave her diary to Zygmunt for safe keeping.\n\nBut they were ultimately betrayed. On July 30, 1942, German soldiers found and executed all three.\n\nThe diary's final passages were written by Zygmunt.\n\n\"Three shots! Three lives lost!\" he wrote. \"All I can hear are shots, shots.\"\n\nWhat became of the diary?\n\nZygmunt survived the Holocaust, became a doctor, and eventually got married and had a family. But he never forgot Renia.\n\nFor years, he kept the diary on a desk in his home office in Long Island, N.Y.\n\n\"He would just sit and read it and ruminate on it for hours and hours. And this went on for several years,\" Schwarzer said. \"He had put up a picture of Renia by his office\"\n\nAt the time, Schwarzer says he didn't really grasp the significance of the photo or the Polish words.\n\n\"I didn't understand what was going on and he didn't tell me a great deal because this was an earlier girlfriend and my mother wasn't thrilled about that,\" he said.\n\n\"It took until me reading the diary to realize, oh my God, the diary is a whole window into his life.\"\n\nFrom left to right: Renia Spiegel, her mother R\u00f3\u017ca and her little sister Elizabeth, who was then called Ariana. (Bellak Family Archive )\n\nIn 1950, Zygmunt found Renia's mother and sister, now called Elizabeth Bellak, in New York and returned the diary to them, the BBC reports.\n\n\"It was a shocking experience to see it,\" Bellak told the BBC. \"It was the first time my mum and I saw it. We were the only two survivors.\"\n\nBellak kept it tucked it away for decades. It was her daughter Alexandra Bellak who finally had the pages translated to English, and sought out a publisher to share her aunt's story with the world.\n\nNaturally, it's drawn comparisons to Anne Frank, another young girl who wrote a harrowing first-hand account of the Holocaust.\n\nSchwarzer says the world needs to hear Renia's story, now more than ever.\n\n\"Hopefully, it can do some good to alert people, especially in times that we're living in right now with the rise of nationalism around the world, in the United States and elsewhere, it can alert people to the threat that this could pose.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear.
