It is simply deplorable to steal food out of the mouths of our learners. It is also completely irresponsible to damage water infrastructure, given the drought we have been through over the last few years,\u201d she says.\n\nIn another incident in the Metro Central school, perpetrators gained access via the roof, damaging the roof and the ceiling. \u201cThe perpetrators ripped out wiring, damaging the school intercom system, and stole ICT equipment from the admin block,\u201d says Sch\u00e4fer.\n\nShe added that reported \u201cminor\u201d incidents included theft of copper pipes, electrical cabling, computer equipment and school stationery.\n\n\u201cIn some incidents, perpetrators targeted schools simply to destroy property and left without stealing anything. This blatant destruction is unacceptable,\u201d says Sch\u00e4fer.\n\nDamage to classrooms, school halls and computer labs included theft of and damage to light fittings, windows and sporting equipment.\n\n\u201cThe estimated cost of damages thus far has come in at around R400 000 with only three quarters of the estimates having been calculated. It is devastating that people are prepared to do this to schools when we know the desperate needs in education and the inadequacy of our budget to cope with them. We should be using these funds to build new schools, improve existing schools, appoint additional teachers and generally improve opportunities for children. School vandalism not only comes at a cost to the Education Department but to the learners and the community too.\n\nSch\u00e4fer says while they can and do try to safeguard schools with additional security measures, they cannot win the fight against school burglary and vandalism without community support as schools, given their extensive physical infrastructure, are very difficult areas to secure.\n\n\u201cA school is a community asset. Tackling the scourge of burglary and vandalism at Western Cape schools is not a fight that we can tackle alone. Everyone should help protect schools as it is fundamental to the future of our children. Our Safe Schools Directorate is very active in mobilising communities to look after schools, in conjunction with the police and community-based organisations. The cooperation of the community and the police is essential in order to combat vandalism and to create a safe school environment that promotes teaching and learning.\u201d", "description": "\u201cSchool burglary and vandalism is a not a fight we can tackle alone,\u201d says provincial minister of education Debbie Sch\u00e4fer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2019-01-24"}
