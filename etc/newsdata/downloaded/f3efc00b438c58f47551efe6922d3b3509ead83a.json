I only wish that \u201cThe Great Society\u201d itself were a more riveting encapsulation of Johnson\u2019s battles over his escalation of the war in Vietnam, and the civil rights struggle, led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. (Grantham Coleman), that convulsed his administration.\n\nAs it is, the play at Lincoln Center Theater\u2019s Vivian Beaumont Theater, which had its official opening Tuesday, lumbers rather than ignites. A lot of arguing rages among historical figures, such as Democratic Vice President Hubert Humphrey (Richard Thomas) and Republican Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (Frank Wood), to mark the debate among officials trying to manage fires at home and abroad. But it\u2019s a survey of heavily traveled historical terrain and one devoid of noteworthy touches of singular perspective that would stamp it as edifying.\n\nSchenkkan\u2019s previous foray into Johnson\u2019s legacy, \u201cAll the Way,\u201d which starred Bryan Cranston as the 36th president, won Tonys for best play and Cranston\u2019s electric portrayal. Guided by director Bill Rauch, Cranston pumped in the jet fuel that the live show needed. With Cranston reprising his performance, it was turned into a far more effective movie for HBO in 2016, and regional theaters such as Arena Stage mounted their own versions.\n\nJohnson\u2019s superhuman effort to strong-arm Congress into adopting the ground-shifting Civil Rights Act of 1964 at least gave \u201cAll the Way\u201d thematic thrust. With Rauch returning as director, \u201cThe Great Society\u201d is a mushier piece, an only intermittently engaging portrait of a leader consumed by turbulent events beyond his abilities to master. In Cox \u2014 so brilliant at the moment as a Murdochian figure in HBO\u2019s scorched-earth family-business satire, \u201cSuccession\u201d \u2014 the production has a star with the theatrical dynamism but not the protean skills to be a good ol\u2019 country boy; the Texas drawl, for instance, escapes him. He\u2019s not the only one turning in a deficient impression: Neither Coleman\u2019s King nor David Garrison\u2019s Richard Nixon are up to the task of satisfactorily resetting our prodigious memories of those figures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Johnson of \u201cAll the Way,\u201d forever reminded that his ascension was made possible by the martyrdom of his predecessor, John F. Kennedy, finds himself antagonized in \u201cThe Great Society\u201d by JFK\u2019s brother, Bobby (Bryce Pinkham), an ambitious and admired liberal Democratic senator from New York. Pinkham\u2019s is the most successful impersonation in the production, but, as with so many of the confrontations in the play, the dramatic potential of the rivalry between his character and Cox\u2019s LBJ gets smothered in the relentless march of events: the demonstrations in Selma; the military buildup in Vietnam; the establishment of Medicare; the passage of the Voting Rights Act. The drama is comprehensive without being compelling.\n\nOn the Beaumont stage, designer David Korins creates a visual cousin to the set that Christopher Acebo devised for \u201cAll the Way\u201d: a bank of seats like those in a deliberative chamber, on which the actors wait for their entrances. Much of the play takes place in Johnson\u2019s office, so the stage feels like a giant waiting room. Linda Cho\u2019s costumes reflect the \u201cMad Men\u201d-type business attire of the mid-1960s. (For the sake of full disclosure: My wife works for Lincoln Center Theater\u2019s landlord, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, which has no responsibility for the show.)\n\nNineteen actors are deployed here, mostly as conveyances of historical facts. The famous personages \u2014 Robert McNamara, Wilbur Mills, George Wallace, Coretta Scott King \u2014 rush in and out with word of troop movements or words of defiance or caution. Events are summoned effectively, but not their emotional toll. LBJ\u2019s tragedy, as a result, is only feebly evoked. That would be the hounding of Johnson from the presidency and the ending of the most tempestuous love affair of his life: with the office itself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Great Society, by Robert Schenkkan.
