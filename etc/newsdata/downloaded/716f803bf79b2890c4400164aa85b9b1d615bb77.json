He joined the Trump campaign in June 2016 and worked at the Trump Tower in the last few months of the campaign. He first served on the Pentagon\u2019s beachhead team after the election but went to the VA after an opportunity opened up.\n\nUllyot\u2019s goal is to take the president\u2019s \u201cdirect vision\u201d and \u201chighly effective foreign policy\u201d and make sure that that is communicated effectively and accurately to the American people. The source said:\n\nWe\u2019ve got a president who has a very direct vision on how he sees force projection. As we saw with al-Baghdadi, it\u2019s when it\u2019s in our best interest but we\u2019re not going to be deployed overseas just for the sake of being deployed where we\u2019ve been for 30, 40 years in some cases.\n\nTrump supports a well-resourced Pentagon, but employing those resources in a smart and efficient way, the source said.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has the best vision of any president in a quarter-century about how to project our foreign policy in a way that serves the taxpayers [and] veterans as well,\u201d the source said.\n\nAlthough he is a Trump loyalist, those who know him say he has a reputation for working across the aisle.\n\n\u201cJohn Ullyot was one of the most collegial senior staff members in the Senate. A seasoned national security professional, I always found him thoughtful and collaborative,\u201d said retired Navy Commander Mark Brunner, a former national security adviser for Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA).\n\n\u201cWe need experienced people to serve in these critical positions, and John\u2019s three decades of service in the national security arena will serve the country and the NSC well,\u201d he added.\n\nUllyot joined the NSC just two days ago, right after the successful U.S. military raid in Syria that killed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe source close to Ullyot described a good NSC team in place under O\u2019Brien\u2019s leadership to take Trump through the last 15 months of his first term.\n\nWith 15 months left in the president\u2019s first term, he is \u201creally hitting his stride and making very out-of-the-box decisions,\u201d the source said, adding:\n\nThe president has the vision for how to have the most effective foreign policy and most efficient foreign policy for our country that keeps us safe, at the same time recognizing that we\u2019re not\u2026going to be policing the world for the sake of policing the world.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard in 1991, Ullyot joined the Marine Corps and served for four years as an intelligence officer. He then served as vice president of corporate communications for AOL Europe before joining the Trump campaign and subsequently serving at the VA.\n\nHe also served as head of global media relations at DuPont and served as communications director for seven years for the Senate Armed Services and Veteran Affairs Committees.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "John Ullyot has joined the Trump administration as deputy assistant to the president and NSC senior director for strategic communications.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/US-Pullout-from-Syria-AFP-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
