Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., who said on MSNBC that U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor's Tuesday testimony was \"explosive\" and that he was the \"top witness that we've heard from so far.\"\n\nOn \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Ingraham said instead, sources familiar with the testimony claim Taylor has \"zero first-hand knowledge or direct evidence of the quid pro quo\" on the part of Trump in regard to Ukraine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This isn't about the truth, this is about just confirming a thesis,\" she said.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Taylor was described to Fox News as a \"good\" witness for Democrats and, on balance, \"not good\" for Republicans. But Fox News is told Taylor did not deliver new evidence to strengthen Democrats' impeachment push.\n\nThe sources said Taylor had no firsthand knowledge or other direct evidence that Ukrainian officials knew that aid to the country had been suspended at the time of the July 25 call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nFox News' Catherine Herridge and Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "Laura Ingraham said Tuesday that if Democrats are confident in the validity of their impeachment inquiry into President Trump, their closed-door hearings should be held in public view.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/694940094001_6096908163001_6096901552001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
