I kept telling myself \u2018This is a playoff that I\u2019m going to win.\u201d\n\nNa, who took a two-shot lead into the final round after three rounds of spectacular putting, looked headed for a much easier victory after birdies at the sixth and seventh \u2014 where he rolled in a 27-footer.\n\nHe bounced back from a bogey at the eighth with a birdie at the ninth, where he got up and down from a greenside bunker.\n\nBut a poor tee shot at the 10th led to a triple-bogey seven. He remained one shot in front of Cantlay only because Cantlay also bogeyed 10.\n\nBoth players birdied the 12th, 13th and 15th before Cantlay took a one-shot lead with a birdie at 16, where Na was in the water on the way to a bogey.\n\nIt was Cantlay\u2019s turn to find the water at 17, where Na drained a 23-foot par saving putt that sent them to the 72nd hole tied on 23-under.\n\n\u2013 \u2018A fighter\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cCame down way too close,\u201d Na said. \u201cI had a comfortable lead, I felt really comfortable. I hit a bad tee shot, got unlucky and made a triple and all of a sudden I felt like I was the underdog.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a fighter,\u201d he added. \u201cThat putt on 17, I\u2019m doing everything I can to make that putt.\u201d\n\nCantlay, who won the Las Vegas title in 2017 and finished runner-up last year, said his six-footer for par at the second playoff hole \u201cbroke a little more than I thought.\n\n\u201cThe first one was really slow,\u201d added Cantlay, who said he couldn\u2019t be too disappointed with his week.\n\n\u201cI played really well,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a lot of putts I thought were going to go in today that didn\u2019t. All in all I\u2019m playing really well and I\u2019ll take that momentum into next week.\u201d\n\nAmerican Pat Perez finished alone in third on 263 after a three-under 68. Defending champion Bryson DeChambeau fired a 63 to head a group on 264 that also included Canadian Adam Hadwin and American Brian Stuard.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Kevin Na made it closer than it had to be, but shook off a triple-bogey to beat Patrick Cantlay in a playoff Sunday to win the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/dea162_korean-born-american-kevin-na-celebrates-trophy-winning-us-pga-tour-shriners-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
