U.S. special operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid into northwestern Syria to accomplish this mission in grand style. ... The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear. ... I want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, and I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us. Thank you as well to the great intelligence professionals who helped make this very successful journey possible.\u201d\n\nAmos Harel, Haaretz: \u201cA few weeks after he abandoned the Kurds \u2014 leaving them alone to face the Turkish invasion of northern Syria and setting off a chain of events that might lead to the escape of thousands of ISIS prisoners \u2014 this important symbolic victory gives Trump useful ammunition to counter his many critics. ... When under President Barack Obama the Americans killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, Trump tweeted that the U.S. Navy SEALs had killed bin Laden, not the president; this is true now as well.\u201d\n\nJennifer Rubin, The Washington Post: \u201cUnsurprisingly, Trump cast himself in the starring role in this operation and overshared details of the operation. If one looks more closely, however, that also should inform Congress of what not to do going forward. Trump\u2019s cockeyed view of the Middle East falsely presumes the Islamic State is completely defeated and deems Russia, Turkey and Syria as reliable powers to manage things in our absence. That\u2019s daft. We should be somewhat comforted by evidence that the military and intelligence community are working to thwart Trump\u2019s impulsive orders as they carry on the bipartisan policy of counterterrorism, which, like it or not, requires a U.S. presence in the region.\u201d\n\nOUR VIEW: ISIS leader\u2019s demise is a triumph for civilization over barbarity\n\nPresident Donald Trump announces on Oct. 27, 2019, that Islamic State leader Bakr al-Baghdadi died in a U.S. military raid in northern Syria. (Photo: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)\n\nChristopher Dickey, Daily Beast: \u201cTrump makes an important point. In fact, it may be an imperative. ... Trump wanted to make it clear that when al-Baghdadi died he was anything but a brave knight. ... Some of the many thousands of radical jihadis and sympathizers around the world who revered al-Baghdadi will refuse to believe that he is dead; others will honor him as a martyr, and in the realm of Islamic sects, especially a cult like the so-called Islamic State, the \u2018disappearance\u2019 of a leader only serves to intensify the passionate devotion of the faithful. That is one reason the Obama administration buried bin Laden at sea in 2011. There would be no grave to become a shrine. ... It\u2019s a given that very few jihadists or would-be jihadists will believe Trump\u2019s version of al-Baghdadi\u2019s death: cornered as his cronies and family were killed or surrendered, then running into a dead-end tunnel with three of his kids where he detonated a suicide vest to blow them up along with himself.\u201d\n\nDaily News, New York, Editorial Board: \"Gone, gone, gone is the piece of human filth ... who led an army determined to subject a swath of the Middle East to a Dark Ages vision of Islam while, using 21st century technology, inspiring people throughout the rest of the world to murder in the name of ISIS. ... Note that al-Baghdadi, who claimed to believe in Islam, blew himself to pieces, violating the religion\u2019s strict prohibition against suicide.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/10/27/donald-trump-isis-leader-top-national-security-priority-editorials-debates/2480963001/", "description": "What President Donald Trump and others are saying about the U.S. raid that resulted in the death of Islamic State terrorist Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Published P.M.
