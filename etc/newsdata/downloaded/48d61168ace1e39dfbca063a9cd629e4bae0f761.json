From their phones in Italy and Los Angeles came this chorus of \u201cOh no, oh no.\u2019\u201d\n\nOur conversation then ranged to Cox\u2019s contempt for Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, Brexit, his traumatic childhood, his desire for Scottish independence, and what he would say to Rupert Murdoch\u2014if he ever met the man Logan Roy shares more than a few characteristics with.\n\nOn Monday morning, post the dramatic Succession finale that so delighted fans, Cox confessed to feeling a little tired. The 73-year-old Emmy Award-winning actor had performed a five show-weekend of The Great Society at Lincoln Center Theater, in which he portrays a power-playing President Lyndon B. Johnson, and he had also stayed up to watch a finale widely hailed as an immaculate end to an immaculate season.\n\nWhile Cox plays a clean-shaven LBJ, Logan Roy\u2019s attractive snow-white goatee has been erased. But be assured Cox will grow it back for season three.\n\nSeason two of Succession not only ended with Kendall Roy betraying his father, Logan, played by Cox, in a delicious twist of an ending, but also Logan watching this betrayal on television with the hint of a smile. His son had finally become \u201cthe killer\u201d his media titan father had thought he could never be.\n\n\u201cI thought it was excellent,\u201d Cox told The Daily Beast. \u201cI was completely engrossed by it. It was really very, very good and very gratifying. It was absolutely on the money.\"\n\nIn the final scenes, Kendall did not take the fall for his father over the abuse scandal on board Waystar Royco\u2019s cruise ships.\n\nInstead, he told the press, \u201cThe truth is that my father is a malignant presence, a bully, and a liar. He was fully, personally aware of these events for many years and made efforts to hide and cover up... My father keeps a watchful eye over every inch of his whole empire.\u201d Promising he had documentation that showed his father\u2019s knowledge and culpability, Kendall said, \u201cThis is the day his reign ends.\u201d\n\nOf Logan\u2019s smile, Cox said, \u201cWe should see it finally as Logan acknowledging that Kendall has finally come of age. He has stepped up to play. He has done what his father didn\u2019t think he was capable of, even though his father is the victim. He is the father killer. That was why he was\u2026 happy is not the word, but he recognized that a lot of ground has been cleared by this act. He knows his son has the killer capacity. Now the only problem is, as we will see in season three, is has Kendall got the ability to keep it up?\n\n\u201cLogan is not going to go down without a fight. He\u2019s going to fight for his family. It will be interesting to see how his children see what Kendall has done, how Roman and Shiv view it, because he\u2019s protected both Roman and Shiv, and as a result did not throw them to the wolves.\u201d\n\nCox chuckled his warm, very un-Logan like chuckle, and said this was his own speculation; season three\u2019s machinations were the province of Armstrong and the show\u2019s writers. \u201cI am merely the player. I liked Logan\u2019s journey though. It was very clear. As soon as the shareholders believed he should be the one to go, he realizes he would rather have it done by his family than the shareholders.\u201d\n\nSome have speculated Logan knew or was inviting Kendall to betray him, which would add another element to the final smile. Is that what Cox and the writers intended?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble. Kendall might fall to pieces or do the opposite. When the whole thing of \u2018killer\u2019 is raised, and Logan parentally says, \u2018I\u2019m not sure you have it in you,\u2019 that is a red rag to Kendall\u2019s rather timid bull. And Kendall acts on it.\u201d\n\nThe cast was filming \u201cforever\u201d on the opulent yacht. \u201cI tell you one thing, I never want to go on a yacht journey ever again in my life,\u201d said Cox. \u201cIt\u2019s very confining. I don\u2019t know where that yacht came from. I\u2019m not interested in where it came from. It\u2019s a sign of wealth and opulence. On TV, it didn\u2019t look so bad, but it was very OTT.\u201d Still, the cast had fun\u2014\u201cwe always do, it\u2019s one of the best casts ever, and then there was Tom\u2019s eating of the chicken.\u201d Cox laughed, recalling Shiv\u2019s husband, played by Matthew Macfadyen, defiantly chomping away at something of Logan\u2019s as some kind of mad act of assertion.\n\nCox noted that in the first season of the show, Logan had said to his children that they did not realize that the business was a game. As much as Logan is volatile, he is also consistent, added Cox.\n\nCox wants season three to examine whether Kendall\u2019s words were kneejerk or true. In earlier scenes, Logan, Cox said, had signaled how abhorrent he had found the abuse stories. \u201cHe has said he is a guy who can\u2019t take his undershirt off in front of his wife. That reveals a lot of who Logan is. He\u2019s a Puritan at heart. Now with Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, and MeToo, another set of perspectives have emerged. As Lear says, \u2018I have taken too little care of that.\u2019 Logan realizes he wasn\u2019t across all he needed to be across. He knew nothing about the abuse.\u201d\n\nPreceding Kendall\u2019s explosive actions, Logan made Roman Roy COO of the company.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things to be explored in season three,\u201d said Cox. \u201cThe succession itself is still to be explored; how to keep Waystar together and stop it from going under; how to stop the proxy battle and company takeover. Roman has suddenly risen, and will emerge quite strongly I think.\"\n\nThe second season has seen Kendall (zombified accidental murderer son) and Shiv (daughter; Cordelia, Regan, and Goneril made one) jockeying for top spot, while Roman (impish ball of malevolent mischief) sneaks up on the inside, almost getting assassinated and coming through triumphantly for his father.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s still up for debate about Logan. They might kill me off. I think that would be a cheat, just to kill Logan off. They should respect Logan\u2019s longevity, but that\u2019s up to them \u201d\n\nIn season 3, Cox would \u201clike to know more about Logan\u2019s background and certain mysterious aspects of him. I liked it when he was watching birds from a gazebo. I\u2019d like Logan to go birdwatching! I don\u2019t think he\u2019s sadistic. I think he is short-tempered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still up for debate about Logan. They might kill me off. I think that would be a cheat, just to kill Logan off. They should respect Logan\u2019s longevity, but that\u2019s up to them.\u201d Cox laughed. \u201cThe one thing about death is that it\u2019s inevitable. In a sense there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d\n\nOne key character was missing from the final episode, and indeed from much of the second season, Logan\u2019s third wife Marcia (Hiam Abbass). \u201cI hope we see more of her in season three,\u201d said Cox. \u201cI think Logan\u2019s wife should have a considerable presence next season. There\u2019s always this element of where to place her. She\u2019s placed in the context of absence and longing. Rhea (Holly Hunter) was a red herring of an affair, never a reality, and all in the kids\u2019 imagination.\n\n\u201cWhen Logan invited Rhea to stay the night, he meant just to sleep, they had enough rooms. The next morning the kids find him in bed alone in his underpants. Holly and I agreed that sex would be the last thing on both their minds. That could happen\u2014but not at that particular point.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s delicious to say Logan\u2019s lines, Cox smiled, and adds there are many \u201calts,\u201d which the actors say, with the producers choosing later which one to use (Kieran Culkin\u2019s Roman has the most).\n\n\u201cI love the moments when Logan takes the cant of something, and reduces something to its lowest common denominator. That element in him is quite Scottish actually. I don\u2019t like his politics and his celebration of money. But I did love it when he says to the more liberal Pierce family, when he is preparing to acquire their media empire, \u2018Would you like to hear my favorite passage from Shakespeare? Take the fucking money.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re an anathema to him, so pseudo about everything, always trying to have their cake and eat it. They remind me of those British theater directors who work at the National and RSC, who don\u2019t make a fortune like other directors, and resent that.\u201d\n\nLogan does love his children, said Cox. \u201cI asked Jesse one time, because I was very much doubting it. And he said, \u2018Very very much, but the problem is, they\u2019re not living up to the mark.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe knows their sense of entitlement is of his making and responsibility. The things he feels they should develop they have not developed. Shiv is brilliant, but too erratic and volatile. He really does judge his children. He is testing them all the time. It\u2019s all about testing.\u201d\n\nCox had just finished filming Succession\u2019s second season finale in Dubrovnik, when he had to start learning the 154-page script of The Great Society. Avuncular and menacing when he needs to be, Cox\u2019s LBJ is trying (and failing) to control events around Vietnam and the growing, explosive battle for black civil rights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting every night,\u201d said Cox. \u201cFor the pace and drive to do it, I recalled those Shakespeare roles I did 30 years go: Troilus, King Lear, Titus Andronicus. Some younger animal version of myself stepped in and did it.\u201d He hopes he conveys the \u201cspinning plates\u201d aspect of LBJ, as he tries to balance the issues, and heavyweight political personalities, besetting him.\n\n\u201cSometimes he talks slowly, sometimes fast when he talks to fellow Southerners. He was good in Congress, but not very good at television.\u201d\n\nHe said both the Trump administration and the mess over Brexit mean political situations in America and Britain are \u201ccrazy and awful. I can\u2019t stand (British prime minister) Boris Johnson, I can\u2019t stand (Tory MP and Brexit proponent) William Rees-Mogg, the whole bunch. Rees-Mogg, who I have met, is a nice man, but what Brexit stands for is a feudal vision of England that Johnson represents, and (Michael) Gove is a jumped-up version of that.\u201d\n\nFor Britain, he would like a second referendum on Brexit. \u201cDominic Cummings has been a particularly malevolent force, and has been given far too much credence. That whole bunch. (Nigel) Farage and all that lot. That \u2018little Englander\u2019 mentality is so archaic, and so not in touch with the world.\u201d\n\nCox \u201cdoesn\u2019t like the word \u2018nationalism,\u2019 but I believe in Scottish independence.\u201d Last week, he joined other prominent Scottish cultural figures in publishing a 12-point \u201cdeclaration of independence,\u201d calling for the country to become independent from the rest of the UK, able to \u201cdecide their own destiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the Scottish are the keepers of social democracy,\u201d said Cox. \u201cThe Brexit referendum campaign of 2016 was awful. The \u2018remainers\u2019 were as smug as anything, and the Brexiteers were out-and-out liars.\u201d\n\nEurope, for Cox, has \u201clots of problems,\u201d such as over-expansion. \u201cBut at the same time, in the wake of what is happening in the U.S. and Russian idiocy, we do need a united Europe desperately. Churchill wanted that too. He would be doing backflips in his grave if he knew what was happening now.\u201d\n\nCox was Rector of Dundee University from 2010 to 2016; Cox says he has seen how Brexit threatens the interdisciplinary worlds within academia. If Brexit happens, \u201cthen Scotland should get out of the U.K. It\u2019s finished. I think we need to be part of a European alliance and get out of the feudal system.\u201d\n\n\u201c Trump is a pink Pinocchio. He\u2019s a liar. I think he is deranged quite frankly, and seriously mentally challenged. And he is as thick as pigshit. He\u2019s an idiot \u201d\n\nCox was appointed a CBE in 2002, \u201cbut I won\u2019t go for anything else. I did that for my family. I would refuse any other honors. I don\u2019t believe in it. The Queen is a fantastic woman doing a great job. Prince Charles is a good guy. But look at what is around them, it\u2019s a defunct system which at its core is about feudalism, which we have not shaken off.\u201d\n\nCox has dual, U.S.-UK citizenship, and came to America expecting an egalitarian society, \u201cbut that hasn\u2019t happened. Trump is a pink Pinocchio. He\u2019s a liar. I think he is deranged, quite frankly, and seriously mentally challenged. And he is as thick as pigshit. He\u2019s an idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201c I wouldn\u2019t play Trump. I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin. People I play have a point of view and have an extraordinary intellect, even if they are monsters like Hermann G\u00f6ring \u201d\n\nCox is a \u201cbig Elizabeth Warren supporter,\u201d but thinks the upcoming election will be hard. \u201cHe was voted in as a reality star. I had a cousin who voted for him. He\u2019s a businessman, but he\u2019s a hopeless liar. He won\u2019t give over his tax returns. I wouldn\u2019t leave him in charge of a stall on the street.\u201d\n\nBrendan Gleeson is set to play Trump on TV, but Cox said he never could. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin. People I play have a point of view and have an extraordinary intellect, even if they are monsters like Hermann G\u00f6ring,\u201d whom Cox played in the 2000 docudrama Nuremberg, for which he won his Emmy.\n\n\u201cAt Nuremberg, G\u00f6ring told how Nazism had been able to grow; he understood what had produced it. In a way I can understand any of those people but I can\u2019t understand Trump. He\u2019s just repellent. I wouldn\u2019t want to play him. I would find it hard to find any virtue in him whatsoever. The only interesting thing about him is that I think he is an abused child. His brother died of alcoholism. When you look at the family structure you can see the darkness there, and he operated despite it.\u201d\n\n\u201c Logan is basically very disappointed with humanity. He doesn\u2019t feel it works, and is up to be abused. And money is what rules him. He\u2019s complicated. We haven\u2019t got to the bottom of him \u201d\n\nThere is no Trump in Logan Roy, said Cox. \u201cLogan is basically very disappointed with humanity. He doesn\u2019t feel it works, and is up to be abused. And money is what rules him. He\u2019s complicated. We haven\u2019t got to the bottom of him.\u201d\n\nCox said he didn\u2019t know anything else about Logan that we currently don\u2019t know. At the beginning, he said to McKay and Armstrong that Logan could be Scottish, but found out he was born in Quebec. Then his co-star Peter Friedman called and told him the producers had changed Logan\u2019s birthplace to \u201csomewhere called Dundee. I said, \u2018That\u2019s where I\u2019m from. What the fuck\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nCox felt Logan might have trained on the newspapers of the famous D.C. Thomson and Co. media group. \u201cJesse said, \u2018It\u2019s a little surprise.\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re telling me it\u2019s a fucking surprise. It\u2019s in episode 9.\u2019 It has given the role an extra depth and edge for me. Dundee was incredibly deprived when I was growing up. Now it\u2019s this extraordinary place where everyone wants to visit, with a beautiful waterfront and a Victoria and Albert Museum (where Succession filmed a season two episode). It also still has a massive heroin problem.\u201d (The city was termed \u201cEurope\u2019s drug death capital.\u201d)\n\nLogan was born in Dundee, and raised in Canada, like many of his age (six or seven years older than Cox), who emigrated from Scotland when they were children.\n\nCox was \u201cthrilled\u201d to film in his hometown in Dundee. However, the home we saw where the young man who Kendall killed was actually just outside Glasgow. \u201cI said, \u2018The stones are all wrong,\u2019\u201d said Cox, who noted that TV and film producers tend to film on the west of Scotland rather than the east. Danny Huston, who plays Laird, asked if Cox could show the cast where he grew up. \u201cI organized a trip. I took them everywhere. I showed them the tenement where I was born, and told them, \u2018It\u2019s a little more rough and ready than you might think.\u2019\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s birth was \u201cvery traumatic\u201d for his mother. \u201cI apparently brought half her womb into the world with me. She nearly died. She was sick for a lot of my early childhood. I was taken care of by my French aunt, my father\u2019s older brother\u2019s wife, until I was 2.\u201d\n\nCox grew up wanting to be an actor, because of his father. \u201cHe was a leader in the community. He had a shop, and gave a lot of credit to customers who were poor. He was too generous.\u201d\n\nThe family, as Cox calls them, were \u201cMick Macs,\u201d Scottish-Irish Catholics, and his father was well-respected in the community. At the new year, the family had parties, \u201cwith endless people streaming in and out,\u201d at which everyone would do \u201ca turn.\u201d The young Brian Cox sang on to the family\u2019s coal bunker. His mother would still be making steak pies for visitors at 4 a.m.\n\n\u201cI immediately understood when I was young that entertainers got lots of adulation. I thought, \u2018This is an interesting life, being a performer.\u2019 That was really the beginning of my conscious memory.\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s father died when he was 8. \u201cIt\u2019s funny when you lose your dad at that age. He becomes mythic, frozen in time. I have that about my dad. I still have that about my dad. I have photographs in my house of dad. He is one of the reasons I felt very disposed to Johnson. My dad could be his brother, he looks like my dad.\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s brothers-in-law stepped in to save the shop after his death. \u201cHe was a good man, a really sweet man. He had massive debts when he died, and just had ten pounds in the bank. My mother thought he was too good, too good-natured, and she resented that. She would say to me, \u2018Brian, just remember, charity begins at home.\u201d\n\nUp until his father's death, his mother had been fine, \u201cif always a little unhappy. Then she had one big breakdown which devastated her. My sister Betty looked after me. She is the eldest child, very unsentimental and rather wonderful I think.\u201d His two older sisters were over 15 years older than him, and were known as princesses. One was called Elizabeth after Bowes-Lyon, then the queen mother\u2014Cox\u2019s mother\u2019s father had served alongside David Bowes-Lyon, the queen mother\u2019s brother.\n\n\u201cTo a certain extent,\u201d Cox grew up wanting to escape Dundee. \u201cWherever your house is, there is the River Tay. I grew up wanting to cross it. What was on the other side? Well, Fife.\u201d Cox laughed. He loved going back to film Succession there; his memories of the city are warm, not vexed. His anger is saved for the \u201ccorrupt\u201d city administrations, and their demolition of the oldest parts of the city, including in Wellgate, where his dad\u2019s shop had once stood.\n\n\u201cIt was a traumatic childhood,\u201d Cox said of growing up. \u201cBut I developed an independent spirit. I learned I was on my own and I would have to deal with it. My mother wasn\u2019t well, bless her.\u201d\n\nHe would go on \u201cwalkabout\u201d around the city late at night. \u201cMy sister was always sending the police to find me. I was in the cinema, the Green\u2019s Playhouse, sleeping till 4 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201c I had success in my first West End appearance when I was 21. I knew then I still wanted to be acting at this age. That\u2019s what\u2019s astonishing: things have got better. It\u2019s always got better \u201d\n\nCox\u2019s formal education was \u201ca disaster. I had no parents, and no one to guide me or make decisions on my behalf. I failed my 11-plus. I left school at 15.\u201d He got a job at Dundee Repertory Theatre as an all-round assistant. He had his first voice training a year later, and says he has been \u201clucky\u201d in his subsequent acting life, which has unfolded over nearly 60 years. He worked early on with directors like Lindsay Anderson and Michael Elliott (father of Marianne Elliott), who told him he should prepare for acting to be \u201ca long game.\u201d He has always played parts older than himself.\n\n\u201cI had success in my first West End appearance when I was 21,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI knew then I still wanted to be acting at this age. That\u2019s what\u2019s astonishing: things have got better. It\u2019s always got better.\u201d\n\nHe takes fame \u201cin my stride. I don\u2019t knock it. I go back to the early gratitude of people liking your work. There\u2019s nothing like it. You\u2019re doing it for an audience, and you value your audience. I feel very blessed.\u201d\n\nCox came to America to make movies after a successful theater career in the U.K. \u201cI came to the point in my theater career where I didn\u2019t want to be one of those actors ending up doing seasons at the National Theatre. That\u2019s not for me, I\u2019m still a worker bee.\u201d\n\nHe knew he would go from being a lead actor on stage to a supporting actor in film. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t odd for me. I remember having a conversation with (British actor) Nigel Hawthorne. I remember him complaining he had just done a film in a supporting role to Sylvester Stallone and how hard it was not to be playing leading roles any more. I reminded him of the time when he was happy to play any part at the Royal Court Theatre (in London), and I also told him I could match his Sylvester Stallone with my supporting role to Steven Seagal.\u201d\n\n\u201c The only thing I did miss was the money. When Tony won the Oscar his pay-check went up. I\u2019m a practical Scot at heart \u201d\n\nCox originally played Hannibal Lecter in the movie Manhunter (1986, the surname spelled Lecktor), a role which Anthony Hopkins went on to make world-famous. Didn\u2019t that piss him off? \u201cNo, the only thing I did miss was the money. When Tony won the Oscar, his paycheck went up.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m a practical Scot at heart. I never resented it. He has an extraordinary theatrical ability, and he is so gifted and is such a renaissance character.\u201d\n\nCox played a pedophile in L.I.E (2001). \u201cPeople kept saying, why did I want to play this pederast. I said, \u2018Because it\u2019s a great story.\u2019 He was a hugely interesting, conflicted character. It\u2019s the stuff of dramatic art and those kinds of challenges.\u201d\n\nBritish Oxbridge-schooled directors, he said, liked to keep actors pigeonholed in certain roles, whereas \u201cthe old boys, Larry (Laurence Olivier), Ralph (Richardson), and John Gielgud were wonderful people who didn\u2019t want any part of that. They were part of the genesis of theater. They were making it happen and just doing the work and being brilliant. They never fell into any of that bullshit.\u201d\n\nCox played gay in the BBC adaptation of David Leavitt\u2019s The Lost Language of the Cranes, back in a time when there was nervousness about playing gay on screen. \u201cDo you know whose favorite film that was? One day, I was in a restaurant with (Nightmare on Elm Street director) Wes Craven, a wonderful man who\u2014it might surprise some people\u2014is quite an intellectual. This guy comes over, and says \u2018You\u2019re in one of my favorite films, Lost Language of the Cranes.\u2019 And that was Ed Koch.\u201d\n\nKoch, former mayor of New York, was pilloried for not doing enough for men who have sex with men during the height of the AIDS crisis, and was rumored to be closeted himself.\n\nDid Koch say anything else during the exchange, I asked Cox.\n\n\u201cNo, but he gave it all away in what he said,\u201d Cox replied, and laughed that Sean Mathias wrote the script for the movie. Mathias was Ian McKellen\u2019s then-partner. At the time, Cox and McKellen were doing a national tour of King Lear and Richard III. One day, on the tour bus, McKellen threw the script of Lost Language of the Cranes at Cox. Cox, who does an excellent McKellen impersonation, said McKellen said, \u201cSean wants me to give you this. Apparently he\u2019s really interested in you doing it. I don\u2019t know why, but he thinks you\u2019d be absolutely marvelous.\u201d\n\nCox paused. \u201cThe problem is being a straight man, today I would probably not be allowed to play anybody gay any more. What happened to acting, playing something? What happens when you bring something to a role? I find the present climate very constraining in that sense; that you have to be that person. There is no measure of ability in all of that. It\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d\n\nCox has married twice, and has two children each from both marriages. \u201cIt\u2019s the point of life, children,\u201d said Cox. \u201cLike Logan\u2019s children, they can be intensely annoying, but at the end of the day I love and adore them. It\u2019s very important that they are their own personalities. I love my kids and love my wife (actor Nicole Ansari). The most important thing, in any relationship, is that the individuals have the freedom to pursue what they need to pursue. My wife is a truly fantastic actress, and it\u2019s important that she is finally receiving the value and recognition she deserves as an actress.\u201d\n\nHe paused. \u201cI\u2019m a hopeless parent to be honest with you. I had no template to be a parent. My father died when I was 8, and so he is mythic forever. I\u2019ve had to learn to be a parent the hard way. I don\u2019t think I am a bad person, but I\u2019m not one of those hands-on parents. I learned my own life as it came. When my children turned 15, 16, I got out of their way, because apart from keeping them safe, which is what I need to do, they have to learn to be their own people.\u201d\n\nOf his older set of children, his daughter went to university, his son to drama school; and the two younger ones want to be actors too. Cox laughed. \u201cGood luck to them, but they also have to realize it ain\u2019t no fucking picnic.\u201d\n\nAging and mortality is central to Logan and Succession; what is Cox\u2019s awareness of both? \u201cI keep as healthy as I can. I\u2019m 73. I don\u2019t know if most 73-year-olds could finish an epic TV series and then put on a theater show in 3 weeks. Olivier played to his age at 80. I don\u2019t see it like that. I want to play any age. When I played King Lear, I played him in a wheelchair which, later in the play, I picked up and threw.\u201d Cox roared with laughter. \u201cI adhere to what people think of age, and then pooh-pooh it.\u201d\n\nCox has heard that Sumner Redstone and Rupert Murdoch watch Succession. Elisabeth Murdoch\u2019s husband Keith Tyson approached Cox in a London caf\u00e9, asking him to \u201cgo easy\u201d on the Roys. Elisabeth, Tyson told Cox, found the show \u201chard to watch.\u201d (Tyson obviously thought Shiv, Logan's daughter, was based on Elisabeth\u2014or that their lives echoed one another.)\n\n\u201c I know Rupert Murdoch is a very private man. I don\u2019t think we will ever meet, or even if we did, get to the point of discussing Succession. But if it does happen, I will just say, \u2018Hello Mr. Murdoch. How are you? It\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about that strata of society, but there are so many differences. The Roys are an entity in their own right. They\u2019re not the Murdochs. They\u2019re not the Redstones. They\u2019re fictitious, and strong in their own right.\u201d\n\nCox doesn\u2019t think in terms of Succession delivering a message to Murdoch and his ilk. \u201cI\u2019m not posturing, or a propagandist. I just hope they enjoy it, and have a good time watching it. I know Rupert Murdoch is a very private man. I don\u2019t think we will ever meet, or even if we did, get to the point of discussing Succession. But if it does happen, I will just say, \u2018Hello Mr. Murdoch. How are you? It\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u2019\u201d Cox laughed heartily.\n\nDoes Cox think Succession has an end-point? \u201cI think Jesse has a plan. Maybe four seasons, maybe five. I don\u2019t think it will go on like Game of Thrones ad infinitum. I think it will come to a natural end.\u201d Cox paused, and let out another laugh. \u201cBut then again, it\u2019s very popular!\u201d", "description": "In a candid interview with Tim Teeman, Brian Cox talks about Succession\u2019s explosive second season finale, why he won't play Donald Trump, and how he survived a traumatic childhood.", "authors": ["Tim Teeman", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571085866/191014-teeman-cox-tease_gfudeu", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
