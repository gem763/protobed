(Tony Quinn for The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Spirit on Saturday made its second and final festive visit of the season to Audi Field, scoring and conceding late goals to settle for a 2-2 draw with Reign FC and suffer a serious blow to its National Women\u2019s Soccer League playoff hopes.\n\nWashington substitute Chloe Logarzo scored in the 90th minute, but Ifeoma Onumonu equalized in stoppage time, spoiling an otherwise enjoyable night for 17,418.\n\nWith the turnout raising the Spirit\u2019s two-game average at Buzzard Point to 18,645, the question seems not whether the Spirit will return to D.C. United\u2019s stadium next year but how often.\n\n\u201cI am hoping we can play every single match here. I really do,\u201d Coach Richie Burke said. \u201cThe atmosphere is fantastic. The crowd really lift us.\u201d\n\nThe 14-month-old venue buzzed with excitement from the start \u2014 and particularly at the finish \u2014 and again provided a big-time feel for a team that plays most home matches at 5,200-capacity Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds.\n\nThe team averages 3,419 at SoccerPlex and will complete its home schedule there Sept. 28 against the defending champion North Carolina Courage. Washington played in the District once last year, interrupting exclusive appearances at SoccerPlex since 2013.\n\nIn deciding how often he wants his team playing at Audi Field next year and beyond, Spirit owner Steve Baldwin will weigh the obvious benefits of operating in the hub of the metro area with the costs of renting Audi Field as well as alienating the small but loyal base of suburban support.\n\n\u201cWe are interested in playing a lot more games at Audi,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where that goes with our conversations with D.C. United, who has been a great partner with us.\u201d\n\n[Megan Rapinoe discusses confidence, equal pay at youth soccer panel ahead of Reign FC-Spirit clash]\n\nOn this night, the crowd came out for not only the NWSL experience but to see U.S. national team star Megan Rapinoe, who in her second match since recovering from an Achilles\u2019 tendon injury entered after halftime.\n\nShe gave high marks to the Saturday scene.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying it for a long time: Women\u2019s soccer can\u2019t draw, right? It\u2019s boring; no one wants to come to it. It\u2019s not fun, right?\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cIncredible, obviously. I feel like that could just be a normal game here. It wasn\u2019t like it was the only game they were going to play here or the championship match or anything \u2014 just kind of a normal game in the league \u2014 and bringing that many people, the stadium is perfect for it, primed for it.\u201d\n\nWorld Cup teammate Rose Lavelle remained out of the Spirit lineup with a head injury, but Washington\u2019s Mallory Pugh assisted on the opening goal and logged all 90 minutes.\n\nSoccer followers arriving via Metro crossed paths with baseball spectators departing another Nationals defeat to the Atlanta Braves, creating a rare blend of red-clad sports fans on South Capitol Street and the Navy Yard. Typically, the Nationals and United do not play on the same day.\n\nThe Spirit had not played since its previous visit to Audi Field on Aug. 24, when a sellout crowd of 19,871 witnessed a 2-1 victory over the Orlando Pride.\n\nWith a month left in the regular season, the crackling atmosphere Saturday collided with a sense of urgency. North Carolina, Portland and Chicago are on their way to the playoffs, leaving one slot up for grabs. Utah, Tacoma, Wash.-based Reign FC, Washington and Houston remain in the mix.\n\nThe Spirit (7-7-5) is five points out of the fourth and final playoff berth, while the Reign (8-5-7) pulled level with Utah for the last slot.\n\nThe Spirit went ahead in the 30th minute on a brilliant cross by Pugh and an expert header by Ashley Hatch for her team-best sixth goal.\n\nReign FC needed just five minutes to pull even. Off a corner kick, Bethany Balcer retrieved the ball and drove a low shot from 15 yards through a tangle of players.\n\nIn the 90th, Hatch made a splendid turn in the box and crossed to Logarzo on the back side for a rising eight-yarder into the top of the net. But early in the seven additional minutes, Onumonu got behind the defense and slipped an angled shot past Audrey Bledsoe.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere, the event was amazing,\u201d Reign Coach Vlatko Andonovski said. \u201cIt was a proper football match.\u201d\n\nRead more on soccer:\n\n\u2018I am in your head.
