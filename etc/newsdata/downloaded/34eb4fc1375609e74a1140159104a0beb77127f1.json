Became the NBA Media Capital of the World", "language": "en", "text": "Share All sharing options for: City of Angles: How L.A. Became the NBA Media Capital of the World\n\nEven by the standards of media days, the Lakers\u2019 2019 edition was a disembodied wall of sound. Minders with printed schedules escorted Lakers players to the set of The Jump; to a Los Angeles Times photographer; to a radio booth where they read promos for The Stephen A. Smith Show; to a curtained-off area where the players\u2019 screams were videotaped for the Staples Center Jumbotron. Hearing wails from behind the curtain, Danny Green smiled and said, \u201cShut up, LeBron.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen seconds \u2026 five seconds \u2026 \u201d a stage manager counted as James sat before reporters. James and the reporters paused while the Spectrum live telecast came back on the air. It\u2019s often said that the 2019 Lakers have the potential to be a TV show. I got news for you: They are one.\n\nFrom his seat, James could see a superteam. Not the Lakers, but a team of media all-stars. In various spots around the room were Rachel Nichols, Zach Lowe, Chris Mannix, Chris Haynes, and Ramona Shelburne. (Combined Twitter followers: more than 2.5 million.) Four writers from the Los Angeles Times were seated down front.\n\nWhen noting the arrival of Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and Paul George, James said, \u201cStaples Center is the biggest winner of the summer.\u201d He could have been referring to the Chick Hearn Press Room. Los Angeles has replaced New York as the capital of NBA media. It\u2019s where striving media types are at their striviest, where highly wrought NBA Twitter gags are composed in real time. L.A., said the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Gay, has become the \u201cHemingway\u2019s Paris of NBA media dorks.\u201d\n\nThe Ringer\u2019s 2019-20 NBA Preview Follow along as we look at the upcoming season from every conceivable angle.\n\nTake Haynes, who seemed to know every player at media day. (As we were chatting, he introduced me to Quinn Cook.) Haynes lives in Oakland. But he estimated he now spends as much as 70 percent of his time in L.A. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to run through the city this year,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cAs a national writer, how can you not have a footprint on it?\u201d\n\nHaynes isn\u2019t alone. Both The New York Times (Scott Cacciola) and The Washington Post (Ben Golliver) have NBA writers stationed in L.A. This fall, The Athletic\u2019s Brett Dawson left the Thunder beat to move here, which brings that network\u2019s total number of L.A.-based NBA writers and podcasters to a half-dozen.\n\nL.A. is ESPN\u2019s de facto NBA headquarters. Heavy-minutes types like Nichols, Shelburne, Kevin Arnovitz, Baxter Holmes, and Dave McMenamin live here. Last year, the network moved its preseason NBA meetings from Bristol to L.A. This year, ESPN made Ohm Youngmisuk its first full-time Clippers correspondent in years.\n\nNichols\u2019s The Jump\u2014which James media adviser Adam Mendelsohn calls \u201cthe Morning Joe of the NBA\u201d\u2014is already responsible for putting an army of writers and former players on westward flights. Beginning this month, Nichols will host ESPN\u2019s pregame show for Saturday-night games and the NBA Finals.\n\nThat roster doesn\u2019t count the dozen NBA content makers at The Ringer, including the chief himself, and various social-media irregulars. Last year, a media barbecue hosted by coach Nick Hauselman, who tweets from @bballbreakdown, drew 50 people.\n\nL.A.\u2019s media buildup is best understood as a belated reaction to a larger transformation within the league. Twenty years ago, many NBA players spent their offseasons in Atlanta or Orlando. \u201cThat has completely shifted,\u201d said ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst. \u201cThe capital of the players in the NBA has been L.A. for more than a decade.\u201d\n\nThese days, almost every shoe meeting happens in L.A. Nearly every free-agent courtship is conducted in L.A., whether the team is based here or not. In June, the Timberwolves\u2019 unsuccessful wooing of D\u2019Angelo Russell included a helicopter flight over the city.\n\nIn L.A., a sportswriter has the same arm\u2019s-length proximity to NBA stars as they do with sitcom actors. Last week, The Athletic\u2019s Wosny \u201cBig Wos\u201d Lambre was at a restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard. It was a faux-speakeasy where everyone acts rich and a no-camera policy is enforced. \u201cRight in front of me walks LeBron James,\u201d Lambre said. \u201cRight behind him is AD. It\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s L.A.\u201d\n\nL.A. is the home of offseason runs and workouts conducted by the likes of Rico Hines or Kobe Bryant. Last summer, The Athletic\u2019s Sam Vecenie was watching hoops at UCLA when he saw a player he didn\u2019t immediately recognize dominating Buddy Hield and Dante Exum. Vecenie glanced at his phone and realized the player was Pascal Siakam. \u201cThose are the only experiences you can only get in L.A. in the summer,\u201d he said.\n\nOther, more subtle forces have conspired to make L.A. the NBA\u2019s media capital. A few years ago, Windhorst noted, the NBA tweaked its schedule so that visiting teams play the Lakers and Clippers on the same road trip. That means players get to spend consecutive days in L.A., which allows them to do a media tour or make the mandatory appearance on The Jump.\n\n\u201cPart of this story is the decline of the East, which is pretty much two decades old,\u201d said Mark Heisler, the longtime Los Angeles NBA writer.\n\nAnother part is the decline\u2014or at least dispersal\u2014of East Coast media. National NBA writers can live in L.A. as easily as they can New York. Players have their own West Coast media shops. Last month, when California governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill allowing NCAA athletes to profit off their images, he did it sitting in a barber\u2019s chair next to James on The Shop.\n\nAs James peered at the media, it was clear L.A. now has three superteams. All three would have to learn to coexist. \u201cYou just have to get used to it, you have to adapt to it,\u201d said The Athletic\u2019s Zach Harper. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be Charlotte.\u201d\n\nThe players at Lakers media day gave off a strange vibe. \u201cIt felt like they were playing a part, playing a character,\u201d Harper said. It was like title-contender cosplay, with the Lakers trying to convince reporters, and maybe themselves, that they were \u201cback.\u201d\n\nJames was the first player to address the media. \u201cDo you still feel like you have something to prove or show to the L.A. Laker fans?\u201d asked Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the Lakers back to what they\u2019ve been accustomed to over the years,\u201d James said.\n\nThat was about as much vintage Lakers swagger as we got. Coach Frank Vogel said the Lakers \u201chave the ability to achieve the ultimate prize.\u201d (Last year, James refused to name any goals.) General manager Rob Pelinka declined to dignify the \u201cacross the pond\u201d rivalry with the Clippers. What pond is that\u2014the L.A. River?\n\nIt was up to forward Kyle Kuzma to remind reporters that \u201cthis organization hasn\u2019t been to the playoffs in years.\u201d The Athletic\u2019s Bill Oram is starting his seventh year on the beat and has never covered a Lakers playoff team\u2014an unthinkable drought for a premier beat.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s going to run through the city this year. As a national writer, how can you not have a footprint on it?\u201d \u2014Chris Haynes\n\nThe Lakers beat has become a laboratory of modern NBA journalism, where how a team plays isn\u2019t as interesting as what superstar players do or what free agent the team might sign at some indistinct point in the future. \u201cEven if the product doesn\u2019t mesh well on the court, there\u2019s still going to be drama,\u201d said Haynes. \u201cAnd drama\u2014that\u2019s the NBA! I love it.\u201d\n\nConsider the content that last year\u2019s 37-win Lakers presented to their beats. Rob Pelinka read a Paulo Coelho novel at a press conference. James brought wine to a Clippers game. There was a meeting between Magic Johnson and Luke Walton. Another meeting between Johnson and the team. A failed attempt to trade away the whole team before the deadline. Walton\u2019s ouster. Johnson\u2019s operatic, almost hour-long resignation in the bowels of Staples Center, during which he seemed to search out more journalists to spill his guts to. \u201cI just remember he wouldn\u2019t leave,\u201d said Oram.\n\nThere was Johnson slagging Pelinka on ESPN. Johnson trying to do the same to Baxter Holmes after his forensic report\u2014the kind of story Holmes was put on this earth to write. There was the Lakers being bailed out by the Pelicans and their own luck in the draft lottery. The Lakers being stiffed by Leonard in free agency. And, almost as an afterthought, the Lakers trading for Davis, the coveted second superstar.\n\nJames had a strange media arc last year. It\u2019s easy to forget that, between dragging the Cavs to the Finals and opening a school in Akron, Ohio, he began the season with a massive amount of media goodwill. Yet something seemed off. Before the season, Plaschke wrote a column noting that James wasn\u2019t much acting like he wanted to be a Laker. Plaschke wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed. As McMenamin noted in his season wrap-up, Lakers players confronted James about his slouching shoulders and side-eye during a team meeting in Memphis.\n\nIn terms of media interest, it hardly mattered. \u201cYou go to Lakers practice and you get boxed out in the scrum if you\u2019re not sprinting to a position,\u201d said Mirjam Swanson of the Southern California News Group. The Lakers issued around 300 credentials for media day. On Monday night, James told reporters that Daryl Morey\u2019s Hong Kong tweet was \u201cmisinformed,\u201d guaranteeing an avalanche of takes. \u201cAs good as the Clippers are,\u201d asked Mannix, \u201cwho wouldn\u2019t want to write about the Lakers every day?\u201d\n\nThis spring, Andrew Greif was getting his teeth cleaned when his dentist asked him what he did for a living. Greif said he was the Clippers beat writer for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cAh, well,\u201d the dentist said. \u201cI\u2019m a Lakers fan.\u201d\n\nTo be a Clippers writer is to know these sorts of slights. In the dark days before Lob City, the Clippers beat was \u201cthe bastard beat,\u201d writers said, or \u201cpariah-ville.\u201d \u201cTo the extent anybody knew that the Clippers were around,\u201d said Heisler, \u201cthey were basically just an object of contempt.\u201d When ESPN moved Arash Markazi from the Lakers to the Clippers, in 2011, he lost Twitter followers.\n\nFor the Clippers\u2019 part, they weren\u2019t always thrilled with their media contingent, either. They thought publications often stashed their lousiest writers on the Clippers beat. A former team employee told this story: Once, the Clippers won a big game, and one of the papers buried the story inside the sports section. When the employee called to complain, he was told the story was too poorly written to run on Page 1.\n\nDuring the early Donald Sterling years, the Clippers deserved every bit of their journalistic neglect. The team was so lightly managed that a beat writer was once allowed to make a draft choice. Who could blame the Times for pulling its Clippers writer off the road in December to write stories people might actually read?\n\nStarting in 2012, the Clippers took alpha dog status away from the Lakers. They won 50 or more games in five consecutive seasons. But the Clippers thought writers weaned on Shaq and Kobe were treating them like a questing franchise that couldn\u2019t handle its first real taste of success (which, in fairness, the Clippers often could not).\n\n\u201cAs good as the Clippers are, who wouldn\u2019t want to write about the Lakers everyday?\u201d \u2014Chris Mannix\n\nIn 2013, Doc Rivers decided to cover up the Lakers\u2019 championship banners during home games at Staples Center. It was treated like a crime against a great franchise. \u201cYou would have thought Doc Rivers walked in and murdered Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at midcourt,\u201d said the former team employee.\n\nAnother time, Blake Griffin was sent to do an interview with a local sports radio show. The hosts asked him when he was going to leave the Clippers and join the big boys. \u201cThink about that,\u201d the former employee said. \u201cWhat other team would that ever happen to?\u201d\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 journalistic state is different, and stranger, than that of the Mets or Jets or other \u201csecond\u201d teams. As the Times\u2019 Dan Woike noted, the Clippers are often a huge story nationally but rarely a huge story in L.A. Swanson told me she would see a player like Pat Beverley being interviewed on The Jump, then flip to sports radio and hear the hosts talking about the Lakers\u2019 hypothetical free-agent moves.\n\nLast year, the Clippers were clearly the best on-court story in town. They traded Tobias Harris, still made the playoffs, and came back to beat the Warriors in that miraculous Game 2. \u201cThey kept running the same pick-and-roll with Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, and the Warriors couldn\u2019t stop it,\u201d Windhorst said. \u201cSteve Ballmer was celebrating like a little girl on the baseline. Even though I knew the Clippers wouldn\u2019t win the series, I loved watching that game.\u201d\n\nYet the beat remained small. Last year, there were two Clippers writers on the road, Greif and The Athletic\u2019s Jovan Buha. At home games, they were joined by Swanson.\n\nSign up for the The Ringer Newsletter Email (required) By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. Subscribe\n\nLast fall, the Clippers held their media day a few hours before the Lakers\u2019 session. A lot of writers listened to Rivers and then split, leaving a pile of Chick-fil-A sandwiches the team had laid out uneaten. This almost never happens with sportswriters.\n\nAt media day last month, the Clippers felt like a team that was beginning to flex its content muscles. They had reserved their own day for media day. Shelburne and Haynes attended, and the tacos from Home State were decimated. When I asked Swanson the biggest difference between this year and last year\u2019s edition, she said, \u201cPeople\u2014there were so many more people.\u201d\n\nLakers media day was doomy and portentous. Clippers media day was happy-go-lucky. \u201cThe vibe of the Clippers is a little like a high school basketball team,\u201d said Wosny Lambre. \u201cPeople clapped when the rookies got off the podium.\u201d\n\nAt home or across the nation, Kawhi Leonard is an undeniable object of interest. On July 4, the day before news broke that Leonard had chosen the Clippers, Greif published a story about Leonard\u2019s college recruitment. He said it was probably the most-read Clippers story he wrote all year.\n\nAt media day, Leonard sat on stage next to Lou Williams. The Q&A was almost newsless\u2014without even the awkward laugh Leonard unveiled last year in Toronto. When a writer asked about off-court chemistry, Leonard pointed his right pinkie at Williams, directing him to answer.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 in-house video team got more memorable stuff on the team\u2019s fishing trip. Until Leonard morphs into Kevin Durant, there might be something about his essence that\u2019s better captured on video than in print. After media day, Markazi was contemplating giving Leonard the full Anthony Slater\u2013at-the-locker treatment. \u201cShoot, if he thinks something\u2019s funny and laughs, that\u2019s probably important to capture,\u201d Markazi said.\n\nJust about all the Clippers writers were interested to see how much the 2019 team would break through as an L.A. story. The challenge isn\u2019t the Clippers\u2019 overcoming their rotten history. It\u2019s overcoming the peculiar state of being the Clippers. After media day, Leonard went to the Coliseum to watch the Rams. When his image was shown on the Jumbotron, he was booed.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s media capital has a final group of residents. They are the international expats who have been hanging around Staples Center for years. Sometimes, the American beats struggle to remember their names. (\u201cThere\u2019s a guy who\u2019s bald\u2014I think he\u2019s Spanish.\u201d) They watch them produce content but have no idea where the content appears. The foreign writers are often consigned to the upper press box at Staples. They exist in a parallel journalistic universe.\n\nAt Clippers media day, I found Italian journalist Zeno Pisani wearing a gold necklace and a V-neck T-shirt. Pisani, who is 44, came of age in the mid-\u201980s, when Italy was seeing its first NBA games on television and the country was taken with the Lakers, Celtics, and 76ers. He first came to Los Angeles in 1996. He has had full credentials to the Clippers and Lakers for 15 years.\n\nPisani\u2019s job is far from a languorous foreign posting. Lakers and Clippers home games end when it\u2019s about 7 a.m. in Rome. Pisani files a gamer that is immediately plopped onto the website of the venerable journal La Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\nLike most foreign reporters, Pisani is good at coming up with local angles. Two years ago, when Danilo Gallinari came to the Clippers, Pisani was in heaven. After Pisani filed his gamer, he and his wife, Sheyla, filmed an interview with Gallinari at his locker. This went to Sky Italia, Italy\u2019s NBA rights holder. Pisani and Gallinari are close friends and paddleboarded at various spots around L.A. until Gallinari was sent to Oklahoma City in the Paul George trade. \u201cHe will miss L.A.,\u201d said Pisani.\n\nPisani can still scrounge up angles. When visiting teams come through L.A., he can hit up Mike D\u2019Antoni, who played and coached in Italy, or Gianluca Pascucci, the new assistant GM of the Timberwolves. Pisani spoke Italian with Kobe Bryant, who spent part of his childhood in Italy. They formed a relationship, and Pisani and Sheyla married on the 24th of the month\u2014\u201cMamba Day,\u201d they called it.\n\nPisani is impressed with the access he gets at Staples Center, which is far better than the access offered by most European teams. \u201cFor you, maybe it\u2019s normal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou grew up with this culture. For me, at the beginning, it was like a kid in a candy shop.\u201d\n\nThe American beat writers told me there was a Polish standup comedian who doubled as an NBA writer. This sounds like most people on NBA Twitter, so I had to meet the guy.\n\nMarcin Harasimowicz was a big deal in Warsaw. He developed a taste for basketball after the fall of the Iron Curtain, when Poland was experiencing Bulls fever (owing both to Michael Jordan\u2019s rise and the Polish character of Chicago, Harasimowicz explained). Harasimowicz wrote for the newspaper Przegl\u0105d Sportowy and flew to America to wrangle NBA stars for TV interviews. One time, he asked Dikembe Mutombo to say something in Polish, and Mutombo mumbled some nonsense words into the microphone. The blooper is still in rotation on Polish TV, apparently.\n\nIn 2007, Harasimowicz was on a trip to Los Angeles when he found himself in conversation with Kobe Bryant. Harasimowicz told Bryant he was thinking of leaving his career in Poland, moving to L.A., and trying his hand at acting.\n\n\u201cWhat is your heart telling you?\u201d asked Bryant.\n\n\u201cMy heart is telling me to try,\u201d said Harasimowicz.\n\n\u201cThen go for it!\u201d said Bryant. Harasimowicz moved here the next year.\n\nHarasimowicz, who is 43, is still very much a basketball writer, producing books on LeBron James and the Lakers\u2014both of which he said sold well in Poland, despite the country\u2019s waning interest in the NBA.\n\nBut Harasimowicz has also worked as a comedy host and actor who is credited as \u201cMartin Harris.\u201d When we met at a coffee shop on Sunset Boulevard, Harasimowicz had just auditioned for a part opposite Michael B. Jordan in a movie. He played a Russian in NCIS: Los Angeles. Harasimowicz has a part in the canceled movie The Hunt, which was portrayed as a liberal-elites-versus-the-deplorables exploitation flick. (Harasimowicz says the critics misunderstood the movie\u2019s dark humor.)\n\nWhen I asked what it was like to be a basketball writer in L.A., Harasimowicz was more glum than Pisani. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s all PR,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t even make really good, insightful stories anymore. It\u2019s just all clich\u00e9, clich\u00e9d quotes. It\u2019s very controlled by PR departments.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the new style of journalism,\u201d Harasimowicz continued, \u201cwhich is pretty much kissing the athlete\u2019s ass. \u2018Just give me something, just give me something\u2014please, please, please, please.\u2019 Where it used to be like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here to ask you questions. You better answer them.\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the buddy-buddy thing that is so fake. Like, c\u2019mon. We are friends here\u2014what are you talking about?\u201d\n\nMedia observers will recognize that as a solid critique of the perils of NBA reporting circa 2019. It\u2019s also a reminder that for its status as media capital, L.A. has very ordinary journalistic problems. It may not be Charlotte, but nobody said it was Eden, either.", "description": "With the Lakers\u2019 and the Clippers\u2019 superstar-stacked rosters, Los Angeles has pulled the league\u2019s center of gravity westward.
