Unlike Trump, Baldwin is capable of laughing at himself.\n\nThe actor\u2019s laugh was ever-present Saturday night during the taping of the #BaldwinRoast at the Saban Theatre in Los Angeles, even as comics like Roastmaster General Jeff Ross, Nikki Glaser, Caroline Rhea and Adam Carolla savaged him with punchlines about his controversial past.\n\nAlso on hand were more left-field figures like Caitlyn Jenner, Robert De Niro and comedy superfan Blake Griffin. Debra Messing was originally scheduled to roast the presidential stand-in but backed out at the last minute amidst her Twitter feud with Trump.\n\nAs Roastmaster for the evening, Messing\u2019s Will & Grace co-star Sean Hayes kicked off the show with, \u201cThey say we only roast the ones we love but tonight we said, \u2018Fuck it.\u2019\u201d Later, he added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Alec, nothing said tonight will be meaner than what you left on your daughter\u2019s voicemail,\u201d referring to Ireland, who gave an understanding shrug from the audience\u2014and later took the stage as surprise roaster to deliver some jokes that brought down the house.\n\nBut before Hayes finished his introduction, he couldn\u2019t help but get in a dig at Caitlyn Jenner. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here,\u201d he told her. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve got balls, girl.\u201d\n\nJenner was a favorite target for all of the roasters throughout the night, receiving the most brutal jokes of anyone on the dais.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Republican, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d Nikki Glaser said to Jenner during her set. \u201cYou\u2019ve already gained control over a woman\u2019s body.\u201d\n\nCalling out Jenner for being a Trump supporter, SNL cast member Chris Redd joked, \u201cYou\u2019re like the Auntie Tom of the trans community.\u201d\n\nBlake Griffin, who recently dated Kendall Jenner, noted that Caitlyn completed her gender reassignment surgery just a couple of years ago, \u201cfinally confirming that no one in that family wants a white dick.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s how fucked up Hollywood is,\u201d Adam Carolla said during his awkward turn at the mic. \u201cBruce Jenner announces he\u2019s transitioning and everyone applauds. Caitlyn Jenner announces she\u2019s a Republican and everyone\u2019s outraged.\u201d When that didn\u2019t get the laugh he expected, he added, \u201cCut your dick off: hero. Cut taxes: Hitler,\u201d before going on an angry rant against \u201cSocial Justice Warriors\u201d who he predicted would label his jokes \u201cproblematic\u201d on Twitter.\n\nAnd then there was this joke from Robert De Niro: \u201cThere\u2019s something different about you, but I can\u2019t put my finger in it.\u201d\n\nWhen it was Jenner\u2019s time to take the podium, and her revenge, she joked, \u201cTake a good look kids. This is what happens when you eat your Wheaties every morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile all of you are making these jokes about how I cut \u2018it\u2019 off,\u201d she said, \u201c\u2018it\u2019 made Kylie Jenner, the only self-made billionaire in history.\u201d After explaining that she raised 10 children, and a few more grandchildren on top of that, she added, \u201cI didn\u2019t cut it off, I just retired it. It was done!\u201d\n\nFrom there, she went on to expertly roast the rest of the dais, including \u201cKendall\u2019s ex\u201d Blake Griffin, who she said was welcome at her home anytime as long as he knew he was the \u201csecond-best athlete in the house.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of her time, Jenner sent a sincere message to the trans community. \u201cIf I\u2019m strong enough to sit up here and get ridiculed all night, you can handle anything,\u201d she said. Then came the joke: \u201cExcept listening to Adam Carolla\u2019s podcast.\u201d\n\nAnd to anyone who doesn\u2019t support her community, Jenner said, \u201cYou can suck my dick\u2026 if you can find it!\u201d\n\nFor more, listen to Roastmaster General Jeff Ross on The Last Laugh podcast below:", "description": "At the \u201cComedy Central Roast of Alec Baldwin\u201d taping Saturday night, Caitlyn Jenner received far more brutal jokes than the man of the hour.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1627,w_2893,x_129,y_107/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567917844/GettyImages-1173049683_kz9sjk", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
