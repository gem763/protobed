That\u2019s because Fannie and Freddie are currently restricted from holding more than $3 billion in capital apiece, far short of what they would need to weather another housing crash as private companies.\n\nFannie jumped 43% to $3.88 in New York trading, the biggest one-day gain since November 2016. Freddie surged 43% to $3.67, also its biggest rise in almost three years.\n\nAmong investors benefiting from the gains are some of the biggest names in finance, including John Paulson, Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management and Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nRead More: Fannie-Freddie Soar as Wall Street Hails Court Win, Mnuchin Plan\n\nTreasury is \u201cin the process of negotiating\u201d a plan for Fannie and Freddie to retain earnings with the Federal Finance Housing Agency, Fannie and Freddie\u2019s regulator, Mnuchin said Monday in an interview with Fox Business. \u201cWe expect a near-term agreement to retain their earnings,\u201d he said.\n\nRevamping Sweep\n\nFor Fannie and Freddie to hold on to their earnings, Treasury and FHFA would have to halt or revamp a controversial policy implemented in 2012 during the Obama administration, known as the net worth sweep, that requires the companies to send virtually all their profits to the Treasury.\n\nHedge funds and other investors that own Fannie and Freddie shares have long fought to end the sweep through litigation, claiming it was illegal. The shareholders won a big victory Sept. 6 when a panel of federal appeals court judges overturned a lower ruling that had backed the government\u2019s right to take all of the mortgage giants\u2019 profits.\n\nRead More: Fannie-Freddie Investors Fighting Profit Sweep Get Key Win\n\nThe Fifth Circuit appeals court judges, based in New Orleans, also concluded last week that the structure of the FHFA is unconstitutional. Investors still face many hurdles, as the decision just kicks the case back to the lower court. Many other federal courts have ruled against the shareholders, making it more likely that an appeal could ultimately be heard by the Supreme Court if the case isn\u2019t settled before then.\n\nLitigating Shareholders\n\nFannie and Freddie don\u2019t lend money to home buyers. Instead, they purchase mortgages from banks and other lenders and package them into bonds. Those securities have guarantees that protect investors from the risk of borrowers defaulting. Fannie and Freddie backstop nearly half of the U.S.\u2019s $10 trillion of home loans, a process that keeps the mortgage market harming and borrowing rates low.\n\nFannie and Freddie were put into federal conservatorship in 2008 as the housing market cratered and were sustained by taxpayer aid. They have since started making money again and paid $115 billion more in dividends to the Treasury, through the net profit sweep, than they received in bailout funds.\n\nAssuming that Fannie and Freddie would eventually released, hedge funds started buying their shares for pennies in the years after the crisis. Paulson & Co., Pershing Square and Blackstone Group\u2019s GSO Capital were among those who got in on the trade.\n\nUntil now, shareholders have mostly suffered setbacks in their attempts to overturn the profits sweep. Their Sept. 6 win follows what also might be a watershed moment in Fannie and Freddie getting out of the government\u2019s grip: the release of a Treasury report a day earlier that outlines the Trump administration\u2019s plan to end the conservatorships.\n\nTreasury Report\n\nThe Treasury document laid out dozens of suggested reforms to protect Fannie and Freddie from another housing crash, shrink their dominant market shares and create new competitors to the companies. Yet, it is only an initial step in what still would be a long and arduous road to freeing the companies from the government\u2019s grip.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac soared the most in almost three years Monday as hedge funds that have long hoped to make a windfall on their investments in the mortgage giants got a double-dose of good news.First, shareholders won an important legal victory after markets closed Sept. 6 that", "authors": ["Saleha Mohsin", "Austin Weinstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TjtHh4q52O9eWqiy50voPQ--~B/aD0yNjY2O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/ccfe0924bfaae703bc192014af4993a4", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
