It was a landmark in the city of Crossville, Tennessee, about 100 miles east of Nashville.\n\nOfficials received a call that it had gone up in flames at around 10:30 p.m. local time. By the time firefighters got to the scene \"it had already fallen down,\" Bobby Derossett, a spokesman for the Cumberland County Fire Department, told ABC News on Wednesday.\n\n\"You're just looking at a black spot on the ground,\" he said.\n\nDerossett said firefighters could only let the remaining flames burn out and then clean up the area. Officials also managed to contain the flames so the fire would not spread into the woods, according to an incident report from the fire department.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what started the fire, but Derossett said there were no electrical fires or storms that night that could have sparked any flames. He added that the fire's cause might never be known.\n\n\"Unless somebody comes up and tells us they seen somebody doing it, you'd probably never know what started it,\" he said.\n\nNo injuries were reported.\n\nLandscaper Horace Burgess first had the idea to create the world's largest treehouse in the early 1990s. After running out of lumber, he said he turned to God in hopes of a miracle.\n\n\"And the spirit of God said, 'If you build me a treehouse, I'll never let you run out of material,'\" Horace once said, according to tourist site Roadside America.\n\nMichael R. Hicks/Getty Images\n\nBurgess did not immediately respond to a request from ABC News.\n\nThe fire department spokesman said the treehouse was made of lumber scraps people gave to Burgess over the years.\n\nIt would eventually become a tourist draw in the small city in east Tennessee.\n\n\"Everybody knew about the treehouse. They'd come from all over the country to see it,\" according to Derossett.\n\nThe treehouse became so overrun with tourists the Tennessee State Fire Marshall labeled it a public safety hazard and closed it in 2012, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel.\n\nIt never reopened, but that didn't deter people from trespassing.\n\n\"Unless you've got somebody guarding it all the time,\" Derossett said, people would find a way inside.", "description": "World'a largest treehouse burned to the ground Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/treehouse-gty-er-191023_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
