Both clubs had reportedly refused an offer to hold the match in Madrid.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s explosive decision has thrust the Catalan dispute to the heart of the political debate as Spain heads towards a fourth election in as many years, which is to be held on November 10.", "description": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 Separatist Catalan leaders on Saturday called on the Spanish government to enter into talks as Barcelona braced for fresh violence", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/06d25a_200-people-injured-in-catalonia-latest-night-violence-catalan-leaders-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
