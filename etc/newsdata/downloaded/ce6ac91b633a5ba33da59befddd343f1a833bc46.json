Most were foreign holidaymakers from more than 20 countries but Australia suffered the biggest loss, with 88 dead.\n\n\u201cIt has been 17 years but the wound is still fresh for me. It is difficult to fully heal but I am trying to let go of the past,\u201d Endang Isnaini, 48, who lost her husband in the attack, told AFP, sobbing.\n\nAnother attendee, Takako Suzuki, told AFP she came from Japan to Bali annually for the bombing anniversary to remember her son Kosuke Suzuki who died in the explosions which opened an Asian front in the war on terrorism one year after the 9/11 attacks on the United States.\n\n\u201cI come here every year to give strength to myself and my other children. This is incredibly sad but we can move on from this,\u201d Suzuki said.\n\nLocal militant group Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), linked to Al-Qaeda, was blamed for the bombings, which took place at two popular night spots that accounted for all the victims. Another device exploded harmlessly outside the US consulate.\n\nIndonesia, the world\u2019s biggest Muslim-majority nation, has long struggled with Islamist militancy and on Friday President Joko Widodo ordered beefed-up security measures to help prevent further attacks.\n\nThe intervention followed Thursday\u2019s assassination attempt on chief security minister Wiranto, a 72-year-old former army chief, by two militants from a group linked to the so-called Islamic State.\n\nLast year, suicide bombers from the same IS-linked Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) detonated explosives in three churches in the country\u2019s second-largest city Surabaya, killing more than a dozen people.\n\nAll the leading perpetrators of the Bali attacks were either executed, killed by police or jailed.", "description": "Denpasar (Indonesia) (AFP) \u2013 Hundreds of mourners and survivors on Saturday commemorated the 17th anniversary of the Bali bombings that killed more", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/694ed7_an-official-japanese-consulate-was-diplomatic-representatives-grieving-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
