USA TODAY\n\nWashington Capitals star Evgeny Kuznetsov didn't need long to get on the scoresheet in his return from a drug-related suspension.\n\nThe center scored a goal on his first shot and his second shift Tuesday night against the Dallas Stars.\n\nKuznetsov received a three-game suspension from the NHL on Sept. 14 for \"inappropriate conduct.\" The International Ice Hockey Federation had suspended him for four years for testing positive for cocaine when he played for Russia at the world championships.\n\nHe entered the NHL/NHLPA Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program.\n\nHOMECOMING: Sharks bring back Patrick Marleau for second stint\n\nINJURY: Penguins lose Evgeni Malkin long-term\n\nKuznetsov, 27, usually on the first line with Alex Ovechkin, opened play Tuesday on the third line. He swooped in on a cross-ice pass and ripped a backhander past Stars goalie Ben Bishop at 4:49 of the first period. He didn't do his usual bird-dance celebration.\n\n\"That's probably 75% of luck when you get like that,\" he told NBC Sports Washington during the first intermission.\n\nKuznetsov played a major role in the Capitals' first Stanley Cup championship in 2018 by scoring a playoff-high 32 points in 24 games. His regular-season point total dropped last season from 83 to 72.\n\nWashington Capitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov celebrates after scoring a goal against the Dallas Stars (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAfter he was suspended, Kuznetsov apologized to his family, team and fans and said he would \"do everything in my power to win you back with my actions both on and off the ice.\"\n\nHe got off to a good start Tuesday.\n\n\"When you're playing hockey, you start to understand how important it is,\" he told the network.\n\n\"I promise to do everything in my power to win you back with my actions both on and off the ice. I also understand that I am fortunate to have an opportunity to make things right.", "description": "Washington Capitals star Evgeny Kuznetsov, who tested positive for cocaine at world championships, scores on first shot after three-game suspension.", "authors": ["Mike Brehm", "Published P.M.
