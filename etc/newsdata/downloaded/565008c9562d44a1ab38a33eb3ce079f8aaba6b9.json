However, Chiefs got their revenge a week later with a 6-5 penalties win \u2013 after an extended goalless spell \u2013 in the Telkom Knockout semifinals.\n\nThe Telkom Knockout quarterfinal draw this week produced the particulars of the first of the latest Soweto derby showdowns. Amakhosi will host the cup game in Durban on Saturday and will stage the Absa Premiership against the Buccaneers at FNB Stadium a week later.\n\nMOKWENA\u2019S BIGGEST TEST\n\nShould Bucs caretaker coach Rulani Mokwena win the back-to-back derbies, he will endear himself to the faithful. But defeats could spell disaster for him in the hot seat and increase calls for his dismissal.\n\nWinning this epic clash could go a long way to restoring some faith in his coaching abilities, as was the case with his former principal, Milutin Sredojevic. Micho didn\u2019t deliver silverware for Bucs, but, during his second stint that ended abruptly two months ago, the Serb got the cup for beating Chiefs.\n\nTHE THEMBINKOSI LORCH EFFECT\n\nChiefs\u2019 long struggle in the derby is not the doing of either coaches or players, but that of one individual who has often turned the show into his own \u2013 Bucs\u2019 Thembinkosi Lorch.\n\n\u201cNyoso\u201d, as the tricky winger is called, has established himself as the conqueror of Chiefs lately.\n\nThe 26-year-old may well be on the list of the most wanted men in Phefeni, the original home of Chiefs, to give an account of himself for the trail of destruction he\u2019s left in his wake recently.\n\nSince March last year, Lorch has scored in all the matches where Pirates emerged victorious, and also salvaged bragging rights in the annual preseason exhibition match, the Carling Cup, three months ago.\n\nAmakhosi may as well embrace the fact that Mulomowandawu Mathoho and Daniel Cardoso have forged a solid partnership in central defence lately.\n\nThe pair might also have observed their Bafana Bafana team-mate Lorch at close range during South Africa\u2019s camp for the friendly against Mali a fortnight ago.\n\nThe Moses Mabhida Stadium was the scene of Chiefs\u2019 last confrontation with Pirates in an official cup clash.\n\nAmakhosi, who were guided by Italian Giovanni Solinas at the time, seemed to have had a plan in that Telkom Knockout semifinal clash when Leonardo Castro cancelled Lorch\u2019s early lead almost immediately, but then lost the game at the death.\n\nCarling Cup defeat aside, Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has never lost to Pirates while in charge of Amakhosi \u2013 even during his bittersweet first spell in Naturena from 2005 to 2007.\n\nThe German\u2019s reappointment in December came at the right time to arrest further embarrassment as Chiefs had already suffered back-to-back defeats when he assumed his tenure.\n\nMiddendorp has already brought back some sense of belief in the team with his first derby since his return finishing 1-1 in February.\n\nCardoso had given his side the lead, but Lorch spoiled the party with a late equaliser. Similarly, Mokwena has also not ended on a losing side in a Soweto derby in an official game since he joined Pirates as assistant in August 2017.\n\nBut \u2013 sorry for Middendorp and Mokwena \u2013 there can only be one winner in Saturday\u2019s cup game.\n\nBIG GAME FOR BIG PLAYERS\n\nWhile Lorch has proven a number of times that he possesses a big-match temperament, Chiefs duo Leonardo Castro and Khama Billiat fall in the same category.\n\nThe two were actually on the scoresheet of the last official encounters between the two giants.\n\nBut if there has ever been a time for Chiefs to disregard the old saying of \u201cdon\u2019t kick a man when he\u2019s down\u201d, it is now. Pirates are still trying to find their footing under Mokwena, while Amakhosi have counted more wins than losses since the start of the current campaign.", "description": "Middendorp\u2019s team could capitalise as Bucs still try to find their feet.", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowagae"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9399/6fcbc91b28b54a7fb05ffc2158e36ecf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
