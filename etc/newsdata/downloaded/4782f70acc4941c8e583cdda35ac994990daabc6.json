Peckinpah may be less revered than Stanley Kubrick or Martin Scorsese but he always had a devoted following\u2014he was one of critic Pauline Kael\u2019s favorites. In 1999, she wrote, \u201cToday, I feel the same, almost inordinate love of his films that I felt fifteen years ago, but the turmoil has gone out of the atmosphere surrounding them. When he was making movies, it felt, for some of us, as if we were watching an ongoing street accident.\u201d\n\nThe Wild Bunch and Straw Dogs are indeed as arresting and disturbing now as they were when they first appeared. One of Peckilnpah\u2019s most celebrated projects was The Getaway, a tense thriller starring Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw. Leave it to Grover Lewis\u2014whose features on The Last Picture Show and the Allman brothers have appeared in this space\u2014to revisit Peckpah\u2019s set to reveal just how wild Peckinpah and his bunch truly were.
