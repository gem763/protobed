The LF-30 coupe seats four \u2013 with the rear passengers being treated to what the company calls \u2018artificial muscle technology\u2019 that can \u2018mold to their occupants\u2019.\n\nThe glass windshield continues upwards to become a roof that can double up as a display for \u2018a realistic star-filled sky, user-favorite videos, and even navigation.\u2019\n\nLexus says the car can recognise voice commands and gestures for controlling things like navigation, climate control or entertainment within the car.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOther eyebrow-raising innovations include in-wheel electric motors on each wheel, rather than axel-based electric motors on a traditional car. Lexus says the car can adjust the output of each motor individually and in real time to allow for more dynamic driving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Lexus Advanced Posture Control technology regulates drive power from the high-torque electric motors to adjust vehicle posture in line with human sensibilities,\u2019 the company explained.\n\n\u2018Fully independent control of the front and rear wheels allows for front, rear and all-wheel drive to be used according to the driving conditions. The compact and lightweight drive power units give greater freedom in vehicle packaging and help the driver enjoy time at the wheel regardless of the road surface or conditions.\u2019\n\nToo bad it\u2019s just a concept (Lexus)\n\nAnd \u2013 naturally \u2013 the car boasts a degree of autonomous driving that means the occupant could just sit back and stare out the roof if they want to.\n\n\u2018The concept features advanced driving support functions \u2013 Chauffeur Mode and Guardian Mode \u2013 based on the Lexus Teammate latest autonomous driving technology,\u2019 the Japanese carmaker explained.\n\n\u2018Occupants can enjoy comfort and peace of mind during autonomous driving with advanced posture control technology being employed. Self-parking and a front door pick-up function, in which the LF-30 Electrified autonomously moves from driveway to doorstep, provide an especially high level of convenience.\u2019\n\nCan\u2019t be futuristic without gull-wing doors (Lexus)\n\nIt features electric motors on each individual wheel (Lexus)\n\nWe say electric car, but it looks like a spaceship from this angle (Lexus)\n\nPlenty of leg room (Lexus)\n\nThe seats can mold to the shape of your body (Lexus)\n\nSadly, it\u2019s not able to fly (Lexus)", "description": "Unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91418007_1571820127.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
