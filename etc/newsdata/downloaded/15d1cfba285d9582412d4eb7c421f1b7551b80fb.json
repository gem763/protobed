Having said that, let\u2019s look at Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR), Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) and Hexo (NYSE:HEXO) in order to avoid the buzz and cultivate better-looking possibilities off and on the price chart. Let me explain.\n\nCannabis stocks. The market\u2019s potential is massive to say the least. But for those that have taken stakes in the group\u2019s most popular names such as Canada\u2019s top producer Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), former capitalization top dog Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) or Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON), losses have likely followed.\n\nWithout getting too deep into the minutiae, early enthusiasm and momentum with most cannabis investments has adjusted to today\u2019s more difficult realities. Cannabis stocks face massive layers of regulatory red tape as they attempt to tap into new markets. And many of these companies are up to their eyeballs in debt while vying to be competitive.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEventually, there will be winners among cannabis producers. And for those investors that hang on, the returns on the right pick could be enormous. I get it. At the same time, buying the proverbial picks-and-shovel plays and the companies already quietly making money for investors, off and on the price charts, makes for an even stronger blend of exposure to cannabis stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nCannabis Stocks Buy: Hexo (HEXO)\n\nHexo is our first \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation. HEXO stock is also the most speculative of our three cannabis stocks to buy. The company is looking to cash in on the niche edibles and cannabis-infused beverages market, and has stronger odds of success courtesy of its partnership with Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) which allows it access to the beverage giant\u2019s many resources.\n\nOn the price chart, HEXO stock is unique among its peer group. Despite this year\u2019s steep correction in cannabis stocks, shares of Hexo have maintained a weekly uptrend. The last few weeks have been spent trying to rally out of a well-supported, small double-bottom pattern.\n\nWith pattern confirmation in hand and a supportive-looking stochastics setup, my recommendation in HEXO is to buy shares today. I won\u2019t put a price tag on the upside potential of this more speculative play. But placing an exit below support, if required, is smart business.\n\n\n\n\n\nScotts Miracle-Gro (SMG)\n\nScotts Miracle-Gro is the second of our stocks to buy. If you\u2019ve ever been in a Home Depot (NYSE:HD) or Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) \u2014 or mowed a lawn for that matter \u2014 SMG stock is familiar with its lawn and gardening products. Scotts is also profitable, offers a dividend of 2.3% and happens to nicely positioned within the cannabis industry as its largest hydroponics supplier.\n\nTechnically, today\u2019s investors are able to buy SMG stock as it pulls back into a high consolidation pattern. The price action has taken on the characteristics of a high handle formation after shares broke out of a large cup-shaped base to new highs, but began to retreat following a gain of around 8%.\n\nWith SMG stock just now registering an oversold stochastics condition, my advice is to put shares on your radar to purchase on a second move back above the prior high and above the cup breakout level of $105.23. Place an initial stop-loss below $99.\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)", "description": "As many investors know, hype doesn't equal profits when it comes to growing a portfolio in cannabis stocks.
