But, despite the queasy feeling, sometimes the answer is clear.\n\nMarlon Anderson, an African-American school security guard in Wisconsin who uttered the N-word in his own defense and got fired for it under the school's zero-tolerance policy, was reinstated last week. The school board president asked district officials to rescind his termination after more than 1,000 students staged a walkout.\n\nThe reversal is good news for Anderson, as well as for rationality and reason. Hopefully, school administrators actually listened to the students they are supposed to serve and realized that more students were hurt by the callous firing of a dedicated school employee than by hearing an adult tell an angry student to stop calling him the racial slur.\n\nIf we\u2019re going to find ways to respond more reasonably to such matters \u2014 the subtleties of race, hateful words and hate speech \u2014 then we have to understand where we\u2019ve gone wrong.\n\nZero tolerance makes zero sense\n\nWhat should the principal who enforced the zero tolerance policy have done? A more reasonable response might have been to let it go. After all, it's hard to make a case that either the belligerent boy or Anderson committed a hate crime against the other. But high school administrators know the risks of making decisions based on logic rather than policy. They are under constant scrutiny, and everyone remembers every decision and measures its fairness against every other decision.\n\n'Wokesplaining' Spanish: Progressives, Hispanics are not 'Latinx.' Stop trying to Anglicize our Spanish language.\n\nWhat happens if sometime in the future, a white student or teacher at that school uses the N-word? Reasonable people would say such a case is different and context is everything, but zero tolerance polices about language \u2014 as simplistic and tiresome as they are \u2014 exist as a shield to protect educators from accusations of bias and favoritism.\n\nIt has got to feel queasy to be a white educator passing judgment on African-American students or staff about using the N-word. But, queasy or not, sometimes we find ourselves compelled to make such judgments.\n\nFinding the moral authority\n\nIn 1992, during my first year as a teacher and basketball coach, a middle-age African-American school bus driver threw my team and me off his bus and refused to drive us to our playoff game because some of the guys were casually using the N-word with each other. The driver seemed most contemptuous of me for letting them use it. I had allowed these African-American teenagers that freedom because, as a white man, I did not believe myself in a position to regulate it. But as far as the bus driver was concerned, my silence had endorsed the offensive word.\n\nHow much is a diploma really worth?: By teaching high schoolers, I've learned not every student needs to be in a classroom\n\nI apologized to him and huddled outside with the team and found my own moral authority representing the driver. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where he\u2019s been,\u201d I told the guys. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what he\u2019s been through. He doesn\u2019t want to hear that word and you ought to respect that. There are people who are hurt by that word. We should all respect that.\u201d\n\nThey apologized to the driver and sat in silence while we rode to the game, not trusting what might come out of their mouths.\n\nMarlon Anderson in Madison, Wisconsin, on Oct. 17, 2019.

I imagine how he might feel and what he might say. I don\u2019t think he would have wanted Marlon Anderson fired. I think he would have sympathized with Anderson and understood that outrage and urgency had forced that word out of his mouth.\n\nI hope we can get beyond the fear and outrage of incidents like this one. I hope that educators can find ways to turn discomfort into educational opportunities for our students, without students having to walk out of class to prompt us.\n\nRespect students as people\n\nLast year, a student at the school where I teach posted ugly racist messages, including the N-word, online. The student is a Chicana, and those messages sparked outrage from almost all the other students. African-American students felt attacked. Latino students felt judged for the actions of one. Our administrators, who are African-American, did not want to expel the offending student. They thought the school had an obligation to try and enlighten her, and they saw an opportunity to teach all our students about hate speech, the perils of the internet and, perhaps, the power of humility and forgiveness.\n\nHow schools can do more: When one of my students grows up to be a moral adult, I'm shocked. And inspired.\n\nI thought they were right, though I wondered whether I could respond that way if I were the principal. Perhaps the administrator's race shouldn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not sure what that bus driver would say about it. Many of our African-American students complained to me and another white teacher about what they considered a weak response to the racist rant. We listened and encouraged them to express their outrage in constructive ways and promised to help them be heard.\n\nIronic? That African-American students complained to white teachers about what they considered the racial insensitivity of African-American administrators? Maybe not so ironic at all.\n\nThey knew us, trusted us and knew that we respected them as people, and maybe that matters more than anything. I think there are no perfect policies for addressing these questions, but if we are willing to know, respect and listen to each other, and have the courage to assert our decency, then we can somehow work things out.\n\nLarry Strauss, a high school English teacher in South Los Angeles since 1992, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and the author of more than a dozen books, most recently \"Students First and Other Lies\" and, on audio, \"Now's the Time\" (narrated by Kim Fields).
