It\u2019s unclear, however, whether that\u2019s a bug or a feature,' said Dr Michael Gaebler, a scientist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.\n\nThe Sussex researcher who presented the discovery, Professor Sarah Garfinkel, said: 'If you\u2019re driving and you\u2019re in a highly aroused state and your heart is beating strong and fast, you will have more cardiac systoles, and that is going to impair your reaction time and ability to avoid objects.'\n\nPast research has found this phase of the heart's activity has other effects on the brain.\n\nPeople seemed to feel less pain or fear, for example, during a systole than they did when the heart was relaxing.\n\nAnd they were more likely to forget words if shown them at the same time as a heartbeat, Professor Garfinkel said.\n\nOther studies have suggested the activity of the baroreceptors can have a direct impact on electrical activity in the brain, although the extent of this is less clear.\n\nThe Max Planck Institute's Dr Gaebler added: 'My guess would be that while cardiac-related perceptual fluctuations may contribute [to accidents], a lot of other things have to go wrong to lead to an accident.'", "description": "Researchers from the University of Sussex tested people on a virtual reality driving simulator and found they were slower to notice obstacles if they appeared in the middle of a heartbeat.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19700096-0-image-a-4_1571068272244.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
