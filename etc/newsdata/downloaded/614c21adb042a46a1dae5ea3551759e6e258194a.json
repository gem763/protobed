REUTERS/Remo Casilli/File Photo\n\nThe next day, Salvini told Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte he was pulling his League party out of its ruling alliance with the 5-Star Movement, hoping to trigger an election that would return him to power as the unquestioned leader of a new government.\n\nThe League\u2019s eurosceptic leader, riding high in the opinion polls thanks to his hard line on immigration, had just made a major miscalculation.\n\nSalvini\u2019s plan rested on two key beliefs: that Conte would promptly resign, and that 5-Star and the opposition Democratic Party would be unable to bury their deep-rooted mutual enmity to join forces against him, five sources, including the League\u2019s economy chief Claudio Borghi, told Reuters.\n\nBut Salvini was proved wrong on both counts.\n\nItaly\u2019s once-dominant politician, known as \u201cThe Captain\u201d by his followers, is now on the verge of opposition wilderness, a mere spectator as 5-Star and the center-left Democratic Party (PD) form a government without him.\n\nA master of galvanizing the masses with his fiery rhetoric and social media savvy, Salvini\u2019s dramatic reversal of fortune shows that he lacked a similar mastery of the political cut-and-thrust in the corridors of power in Rome.\n\nDespite this summer\u2019s chastening experience, Salvini does still remain a potent political force and could be back - especially if a new 5-Star/PD government proves short-lived.\n\nBorghi told Reuters Salvini had been resisting internal party pressure to trigger elections, including from Borghi himself, but eventually relented at the August meeting.\n\n\u201cLots of us were telling him he had to bring down the government, even though we know there were risks,\u201d said Borghi, who attended the Aug. 6 gathering.\n\nBAD ADVICE\n\nSalvini\u2019s plot to ditch 5-Star and win power alone after months of bickering over economic policies and relations with the European Union, started to go wrong from the off when Conte declined to relinquish power.\n\nThat was not what Salvini had expected. A senior League source said Salvini\u2019s low-profile number two, Giancarlo Giorgetti, an eminence grise who does much of the party\u2019s back-room power broking, had assured him Conte would go.\n\nInstead Conte, a law professor plucked from obscurity to lead the coalition government, showed he had no intention of returning to academia. Rather than resign, he demanded to know why Salvini wanted to bring down the government and called for a transparent parliamentary debate.\n\nWith parliament in recess for the summer break, that meant lawmakers first had to be summoned from their holidays - giving them time to come up with a plan to thwart Salvini\u2019s ambitions.\n\n\u201cIn order to bring down the government he should have withdrawn the League\u2019s ministers from the cabinet rather than just asking Conte to resign,\u201d said Roberto Maroni, a former interior minister and Salvini\u2019s predecessor as League leader.\n\n\u201cHe gave his adversaries time to negotiate and create a new government.\u201d\n\nWith Conte sitting tight, the League filed a no-confidence motion in its own government, hoping to topple it as soon as parliament reconvened on Aug. 12.\n\nBut the 5-Star Movement and many Democratic Party lawmakers were furious about Salvini\u2019s maneuvering and returned determined to check his sprint toward a snap election.\n\nThey refused to even schedule Salvini\u2019s no-confidence motion - instead giving priority to the debate demanded by Conte.\n\n\u201cSalvini miscalculated the timing, he wanted a blitzkrieg but ended up stuck in the trenches,\u201d said Francesco Galietti, head of Policy Sonar, a political risk consultancy in Rome.\n\nELECTION TABOO\n\nSalvini\u2019s August gambit was not only mistimed because parliament was closed, but also because it meant any election would have interrupted preparations for a crucial 2020 budget.\n\nIn Italy, budget season is a drawn-out process which occupies parliament from the start of October to the end of the year. Dissolving the assembly during this period is so taboo that elections have not been held in autumn since 1919.\n\nThis handed Salvini\u2019s opponents a perfect excuse to resist his election push. They said they had to save Italians from a big increase in sales tax Rome had promised the European Commission it would enact unless alternative savings could be found in the 2020 budget.\n\nIf Salvini had made his move straight after a triumph in European Parliament elections in May when the League took 34% of the vote, national elections could have been held in July - avoiding the risk of stalling such a key budget.\n\n\u201cSalvini had two windows of opportunity to go for a vote - either right after the EU elections or in early 2020. This August move was nonsense,\u201d said Lorenzo Pregliasco, head of polling and political analysis firm YouTrend.\n\nHowever, Borghi said the early 2020 option was no longer viable because Salvini had been boxed into a corner by a reform tabled by 5-Star to cut the number of lawmakers.\n\nThe change, which was due to be passed in parliament in September, would have led to a lengthy process of redrawing electoral boundaries and a referendum - effectively meaning parliament could not be dissolved for two years.\n\nBorghi said the alliance with 5-Star was breaking down and there were particular frustrations with Economy Minister Giovanni Tria. He is not affiliated to either ruling party but was keeping the League out of key policy decisions, Borghi said.\n\nHe said Tria was ignoring the League\u2019s demands for big tax cuts and repeatedly made commitments to Brussels for a deficit-cutting budget which ran counter to the League\u2019s line.\n\nEven worse, 5-Star\u2019s leader Luigi Di Maio had switched tack from taking on Brussels with the League to backing Tria in a bid to undermine the League\u2019s constant rise in the polls.\n\n\u201cI told him: \u2018Matteo, you have to get rid of Tria, or you have to pull out,\u201d Borghi told Reuters.\n\nENTER THE OLD GUARD\n\nDespite the questionable timing, Salvini\u2019s attack may still have come off but for the decisive return of two figures who had drifted away from the limelight: former PD prime minister Matteo Renzi and 5-Star\u2019s 71-year-old founder, comedian Beppe Grillo.\n\nSalvini was banking on 5-Star\u2019s Di Maio and Democratic Party chief Nicola Zingaretti wanting to fight elections, rather than bury their bitter rivalry and forge an unlikely alliance.\n\nBut when Salvini announced his coalition with 5-Star was dead, Renzi said elections would be irresponsible and called for a deal with 5-Star - a dramatic U-turn for a politician who had always been a fierce enemy of the anti-establishment movement.\n\nZingaretti did initially favor an election, as Salvini had hoped, but he backed down and entered coalition talks with 5-Star because he feared a revolt by PD lawmakers still loyal to Renzi, who had picked them as candidates at the last election.\n\nA similar chain of events took place within 5-Star.\n\nAccording to a 5-Star junior minister, Di Maio and most of the party\u2019s leadership did want to go to elections after Salvini pulled the plug on the coalition.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t think we could win but they thought we could hold up well, that Salvini wouldn\u2019t be able to do what he promised, and we could bounce back in a couple of years,\u201d said the politician, who asked not to be named.\n\nGrillo had other ideas.\n\nThe man who founded 5-Star in 2009 had no intention of seeing his creation destroyed by Salvini at the ballot box.\n\nIn an Aug. 10 blog that took the whole movement by surprise, Grillo said 5-Star had to survive at all costs to save Italy from the \u201cnew barbarians\u201d represented by Salvini.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nGrillo still wields huge influence over 5-Star\u2019s members and it is almost taboo to oppose him. In further posts he continued to urge an alliance with the PD despite the reluctance of Di Maio - keeping the door shut on Salvini\u2019s election hopes.\n\nIn an online ballot on Tuesday, 79.3% of 5-Star supporters voted in favor of joining forces with the Democratic Party, paving the way for Conte to complete work on a new coalition government uniting the long-time political foes.\n\nAsked in a television interview on Monday whether he had made strategic mistakes, Salvini said: \u201cI prefer to be seen as naive than someone who clings to power.\u201d", "description": "At a closed-door meeting on Aug. 6, Matteo Salvini's advisers told the populist Italian politician he was trapped in an unproductive coalition government and should bring it down.", "authors": ["Gavin Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426032217&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830FS"}
