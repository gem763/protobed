The goal was to stop legislation that would hold insured patients harmless for sometimes staggering bills for out-of-network care by setting federal rates to resolve billing disputes. Both the Senate health and House Energy and Commerce committees have passed versions of this policy.\n\nThe two health staffing companies have both previously been accused of shifting the cost of uncompensated care in billing disputes to patients. Both say that's no longer the case and that they support a federal solution to surprise billings. But they don't like the congressional panels' approach, which they call government \"rate-setting.\" Their involvement was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nEnding surprise bills, a big concern for voters of all stripes, was viewed as one of the only health issues in Congress with bipartisan appeal and the backing of the Trump administration. Everyone agreed that a patient who followed the rules and went to an in-network hospital shouldn't get slammed with enormous bills because he or she ended up with an out-of-network provider, such as an emergency physician or anesthesiologist. But insurers, employers, doctors and hospitals from the beginning have vigorously fought over how to solve the problem and who should pay.\n\nTwo sources affiliated with Doctor Patient Unity confirmed that Envision Healthcare and TeamHealth are funding a portion of the $28.6 million campaign that runs from July 30 to Sept. 17 in states including Alabama, California, Colorado and New Hampshire, according to Advertising Analytics. The sources wouldn't say who else is involved but confirmed the two companies are funders.\n\nGreg Blair, a spokesperson for Doctor Patient Unity, also confirmed the two companies are funders, and in a statement said the pair represent tens of thousands of doctors who support an alternate approach to ending surprise medical bills that's been enacted in New York and Texas. Those states both use independent mediators to settle payment disputes \u2014 an approach known as arbitration \u2014 not a government-set pay scale.\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Two additional House committees are working on their own surprise billing legislation, muddling prospects for compromise by year's end.\n\nThe messaging from the health staffing companies, doctors and hospitals has been countered by the Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing, backed by employers and insurers, which recently launched a multimillion-dollar ad campaign claiming arbitration is a handout to health providers backed by private equity firms. They portray government rate-setting as the only effective way to clamp down on health costs.\n\nThe alliances reflect the changing nature of the health care system. In the past, doctors typically worked for a hospital. Now, staffing companies like Envision and TeamHealth employ many doctors in certain specialties and hire them out to hospitals. Kaiser Health News reported earlier this month that private equity and venture capital firms are buying up physician staffing companies \u2014 and could see their bottom lines cut by certain billing reforms.\n\nDoctor Patient Unity sent mailers over August recess as part of its campaign. One obtained by POLITICO that was sent to constituents of Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), a Ways and Means Committee member, urges them to tell him to \u201csay no to rate setting\u201d as the panel prepares to draft its own billing legislation. Kildee\u2019s office says he\u2019s already signed onto a bill providers like. Another mailer thanks Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) for \u201cstopping the health care nightmare of rate setting.\u201d\n\nDoctor Patient Unity will continue to push its rate-setting message and shift to more 'thank you' messages to members, and also advocate for arbitration, according to one source.\n\n", "description": "The group emerged shortly before Congress' August recess and began running $28.6 million in<b> </b>ads targeting prominent lawmakers.", "authors": ["Rachel Roubein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e8/f4/f713021241638d9262b54d9d0b9a/190913-hospital-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
