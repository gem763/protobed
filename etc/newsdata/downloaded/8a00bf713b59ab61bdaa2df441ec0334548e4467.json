There\u2019s no better testament to the Houston Astros\u2019 dramatic success than the fact that they\u2019ll play the Washington Nationals at home on Tuesday night to open the World Series. And there\u2019s no sharp turn of phrase nor incisive analysis that will render the experience any more powerful than simply saying, \u201cHow great was that?\u201d to anyone who saw it live and, \u201cHere, go watch it for yourself,\u201d to anyone who did not.\n\nThe real problem with baseball games getting longer \u2014 and, in October, later \u2014 is that the best parts are often at the end. Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, which the Astros won 6-4 on Saturday night, was boring until it wasn\u2019t. A rainout in New York erased the travel day and both teams decided to start relievers, commit to half a dozen pitching changes each, and keep their aces in their back pockets in case this thing went seven. The Astros took an early lead, the Yankees left a lot of guys on base, and for three hours and fifty minutes it looked like we\u2019d be writing about how the decisive game between two 100-plus-win powerhouses came down to bullpen management and dramatic defense. You know, nerd stuff. But then the jocks did their thing and there wasn\u2019t much left to analyze.\n\nIn the top of the ninth inning, DJ LeMahieu single-handedly staved off impending elimination with a two-run shot to tie the game at 4. Just like that the Yankees were back from the brink \u2014 threatening to make the night a whole lot longer with extra innings, and extending the series as long as possible with a winner-take-all Game 7.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Astros\u2019 Josh Reddick had just been moved from right field, where the ball went over the fence, to left field at the start of the frame. \u201cI didn\u2019t really look around very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI put my hands on top of my head as soon as I saw it bounce around. One of those things where your heart hits the floor.\u201d\n\nRoberto Osuna recorded two more outs and the Astros went back to the dugout.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing was that the game was tied. We weren\u2019t down a run, we weren\u2019t down two or three. It\u2019s tied,\u201d said George Springer, who had been inches away from grabbing the home run ball out of the clutches of the bleachers and the box score.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we still had outs to play with, the game wasn\u2019t over,\u201d said Michael Brantley, who was responsible for the highest-octane moment of the night prior to the ninth, making an amazing diving catch in the outfield and doubling off Aaron Judge to stymie a budding Yankees\u2019 rally in the 7th.\n\n\u201cWe knew when we woke up this morning that we were going to be watching football tomorrow so someone was going to get the job done,\u201d star Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said.\n\nIn the bottom of the ninth inning, Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman got the first two Astros out. At some point between Martin Maldonado\u2019s strikeout and Springer\u2019s walk, Jos\u00e9 Altuve slipped back into the video room to watch some film and study the pitches. It worked.\n\nHe didn\u2019t swing at the first pitch, or the second.\n\n\u201cI was sitting on the stairs and I looked at Mike [Brantley] after the 2-0 pitch and I said, \u2018Jos\u00e9\u2019s gonna win this for us,\u2019\u201d Reddick said.\n\n\u201cI looked at Wade [Miley], I think 2-0 and I was like, \u2018Man, if he throws anything down and in, it\u2019s going out,\u2019\u201d Gerrit Cole said. \u201cAnd Wade is like, \u2018It\u2019s going out to right.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s not going out to right! It\u2019s going out to left.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo pitches later, Altuve \u2014 the longest-tenured Astro and the one who received the heartiest boos while the series was in New York \u2014 hit a two-run bomb to left-center to break the tie and send his team to its second World Series in three years. It was just like the 43,357 faithful who stayed for a four-hour game, and then the ensuing triumphant celebration, would have scripted it if it could.\n\n\u201cGosh, I guess it was backdoor slider and he still pulled it out to left so I was only right on like two-thirds of it,\u201d Cole said.\n\nIt was just the fifth postseason walk-off home run to secure a pennant. The ones that came before are enshrined in the annals of baseball history \u2014 you\u2019d know the clips if you saw them, but probably not the columns that ran the morning after.\n\nStill, we act like there\u2019s something to be gleaned from describing the confetti or the way Altuve\u2019s daughter, wearing her gold high-top sneakers, pulls his brand new World Series hat off his head, puts it back on, and pinches his cheeks. It makes it feel real, I suppose. Elongated, even, so that it can loom as large in resonance as it will eventually in legacy.\n\nOr maybe just the opposite. Hitting a home run is so difficult and impressive. That it ever happens at all is worth marveling at. You watch too many highlights, and you run the risk of forgetting that. Don\u2019t cut to the chase just because now that you know how it ends it can never been as suspenseful, or as magical, again. Maybe the value in writing about an indelible moment like Altuve\u2019s instantly iconic ALCS-winning home run is making it seem small and precarious in a world where it already exists and dominates the narrative. Forcing ourselves to see in retrospect that it never was scripted and that the headline for a four-hour game happened in an instant. Not because it\u2019s a good story, but because Jos\u00e9 Altuve did something really special.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The final frame of the Astros' ALCS Game 6 triumph over the Yankees is an instant classic.", "authors": ["Hannah Keyser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.3fKDQRmetbpvKiKqTvUIA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oPZbfUeewXLDR3rThcNPtw--~B/aD0zMzQ0O3c9NTAxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7ace1fb0-f321-11e9-ac3f-4723bbd3d26d", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
