An American convoy leaving the city of Qamishli was hit with potatoes on Monday while protesters shouted \u201cNo America\u201d and \u201cAmerica liar,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cLike rats, America is running away,\u201d one protester yelled, according to media reports.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Trump announced that he would pull U.S. troops from key buffer zones along the Turkey-Syria border. The move paved the way for a Turkish military assault against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a key ally in the U.S. fight against the Islamic State.\n\nTurkey considers elements of the group to be terrorists.\n\nAs the Turkish military assault gained steam last week, the U.S. announced it would pull virtually all of its 1,000 troops from northeastern Syria to keep them out of harm\u2019s way.
