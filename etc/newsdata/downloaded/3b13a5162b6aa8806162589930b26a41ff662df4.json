She trained hard despite being from the humble background to represent India in international competitions. She was the next big thing for Indian archery.\n\nIn 2007, Nisha won silver in the team event at the Asian Championship. The following year, a bronze came in the same event only it was the Asian Grand Prix this time. 2008 also saw her secure a South Asian Archery Championship silver.\n\nBy 2010, she was on top of her game and a budding future beckoned in the sport of archery. All seemed well, or so it appeared.\n\nTwitter\n\nBut life has a way of complicating things. After both her sisters got married, she had to support her parents who were ageing. Archery had to take a back seat.\n\nDon't Miss 116 SHARES 8.8 K SHARES 19.9 K SHARES\n\nWorse was to follow when her mud house needed repairs and with no help from the authorities, she had to sell her bow for Rs 50,000 to pay for the damages. Her father was a farmer who did not even have much land and faced difficulty even to buy seeds for farming. By 2012, archery and Nisha took different paths.\n\nWith no financial aid, she had to quit the sport. Her bow was worth Rs 4 lakh and was sold at a huge loss. Nisha faded into oblivion and her name became a mere footnote in our archery history.\n\nNow if you ask people about Indian archery, nobody will take her name because she has been pushed to the background. If you were to mention her name to people, nobody would know who she is. The sad reality is that athletes like her who give it their all for the country hardly get anything in return.\n\nShe is now just a name on a page somewhere. She is detached from the sport and we the sport-loving public are the ones who are poorer for it.", "description": "Nisha Dutta took up archery at the age of just 13.
