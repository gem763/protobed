Champions of the legislation proved in the House that it was possible to build a broad, bipartisan coalition to retool marijuana laws even as many Republicans resist legalization and the drug remains illegal at the federal level.\n\nThe House legislation wouldn\u2019t change the legal status of cannabis but would shield banks and insurers from penalties if they choose to serve the industry where it has become lawful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer about cannabis,\u201d said Don Murphy of Marijuana Policy Project. \u201cIt\u2019s not cannabis advocates calling for this. It\u2019s bankers. And Realtors. And insurance companies. And those are folks that Republicans respond to.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Pro Cannabis High-quality coverage of one of the fastest growing industries in the country. Sign up for a free preview.

And marijuana advocates recognize they have less clout with Republicans and say they\u2019ll let banking advocates take center stage in the Senate.\n\nAmerican Bankers Association President and CEO Rob Nichols said the cannabis bill will be a \u201ckey priority\u201d when the group\u2019s members visit Washington to meet with lawmakers this fall.\n\n\u201cThe politics of marijuana are changing,\u201d said Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), a key player in the effort to whip House Republican votes. \u201cBut there are a lot of people who are going to vote 'yes' on this who are not for the legalization of marijuana, like me.\"\n\nHouse sponsors took this into account. The final bill they sent across the Capitol had additions designed to make it more palatable to Republican senators.\n\nProtections for hemp were added to cater directly to hemp-industry backers including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who pushed hard for its legalization in the 2018 farm bill.\n\nAnother provision was added to restrict bank regulators from pressing lenders to cut ties with customers based on reputational risk. It was aimed at winning over Republicans who wanted Congress to prevent the revival of an Obama-era program known as \u201c Operation Choke Point\u201d that GOP critics said discouraged banks from serving payday lenders and gun retailers.\n\nCrapo, long seen as a potential hurdle to cannabis banking legislation, was among the \u201cChoke Point\u201d initiative\u2019s most vocal critics.\n\n\"The hemp language I predict will get Sen. McConnell\u2019s attention,\u201d Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) said. \u201cThe anti-Choke Point language I predict will get Sen. Crapo's attention.\"\n\nFueling optimism in the Senate is a seeming lack of opposition from President Donald Trump and buy-in from Republicans such as Crapo, whose state has not legalized cannabis but who has been moved by fallout from the federal-state conflict.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed hard for hemp legalization in the 2018 farm bill. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nAnd five Republican senators already co-sponsor a companion cannabis banking bill. Its lead GOP sponsor is Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is facing a tough reelection battle in a purple state with a major marijuana industry.\n\n\u201cI see it really as a fairness bill, a fairness banking bill more than a cannabis bill. And that\u2019s okay,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a co-sponsor of the bill.\n\nIronically, Democrats may present a new hurdle in the Senate.\n\nPro-marijuana presidential candidates in the Senate such as Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have said they would prefer that comprehensive marijuana reform move before piecemeal legislation that caters solely to the already-existing marijuana industry.\n\n\u201cWe can & must do more,\u201d Booker tweeted Wednesday night immediately after the House vote.\n\nWobbly support from Democrats is not keeping advocates up at night, however, because it falls to Republican leaders like Crapo and McConnell to make the decisions about this bill. Democrats are unlikely to flee en masse from the bill.\n\n\u201cI think that perhaps the most interesting debates going on in Congress on this topic are inside the minds of individuals,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cDemocrats have to do something for the banking industry and Republicans have to do something for the cannabis industry. And at the end, you get this kind of policy, maybe.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3a/df/410c1e014a2593e803aae12c9837/190925-crapo-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
