Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), respectively \u2014 made public a document excerpting text messages exchanged between government officials working on the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. Those officials sat in positions that are currently under intense scrutiny, with still-expanding questions about President Trump\u2019s behavior toward Ukraine and his efforts to get that country to conduct investigations that he hoped would aid him politically.\n\nWhile the released text messages aren\u2019t comprehensive (representing \u201conly a subset of the full body of the materials,\u201d according to the letter accompanying the messages) and don\u2019t directly implicate Trump, they contain significant revelations and suggestions about the Trump-Ukraine interactions. They include, in two suggestive moments, specifically the sort of don\u2019t-document-this responses that imply an awareness of lines being crossed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n1. There\u2019s an explicitly stated quid pro quo.\n\nA central participant in the messages is Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Ukraine. Until last week, he served in the administration, resigning shortly after he was identified in a complaint filed by a whistleblower in the intelligence community. The whistleblower portrayed Volker as working with European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland to try to run interference between Ukrainian officials and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was pressing for Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nThe text messages suggest that Volker and Sondland might more accurately be described as trying, at times, to effect what Giuliani \u2014 and Trump \u2014 wanted to see: an investigation into a completely unfounded attempt to link Ukraine to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee network in 2016 and a probe of Biden and work his son Hunter did for an energy company called Burisma Holdings. The Trump-Giuliani theory is that Joe Biden wanted Ukraine to fire its general prosecutor to protect Hunter and Burisma; there remains no significant evidence that this happened.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn July 21, four days before Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a phone call in which Trump asked Zelensky to conduct precisely those investigations, Sondland had a text message exchange with Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador in Ukraine. Taylor made clear that Zelensky wanted \u201cUkraine [to be] taken seriously\u201d and not just serve as \u201can instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\u201d Part of that, it is later revealed, is getting Zelensky an invitation to meet Trump in Washington.\n\nShortly before the call on July 25, Volker texted Andrey Yermak, an adviser to Zelensky (who had been inaugurated two months prior). In that message, Volker was explicit about what it would take to get that meeting.\n\n\u201cHeard from White House,\u201d Volker wrote, \u201cassuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is as explicit a quid pro quo as you can get: Promise to get to the bottom of events in 2016 \u2014 which could refer to either the hacking or to the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor targeted by Biden \u2014 and you\u2019ll get the validity that comes with a White House visit.\n\nWhat\u2019s not clear is who Volker spoke with in the White House. In the call between Trump and Zelensky later that day, the meeting was raised, with Trump vaguely suggesting that Zelensky could pick his dates only after the Ukrainian leader had promised to go along with the politically useful investigations Trump wanted to see.\n\nThe extent to which that visit was important to Zelensky was highlighted when he and Trump met on Sept. 25 on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want to thank you for the invitation to Washington,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cYou invited me, but I think \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. But I think you forgot to tell me the date.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeople in attendance laughed. Trump looked annoyed and pointed to someone standing nearby. \u201cThey\u2019ll tell you the date,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, they know before us,\u201d Zelensky replied.\n\n2. The U.S. helped shape a statement from Ukraine mentioning the Biden probe.\n\nIn a text message exchange with Volker immediately after the call, Zelensky\u2019s aide Yermak suggested Sept. 20 through 22. By early August, though, those dates hadn\u2019t been confirmed.\n\nIn an exchange with Volker on Aug. 9, Sondland suggested that dates would be finalized as soon as Yermak confirmed \u2026 something. From the context of Sondland\u2019s comments in the thread, it seems that the something is a written statement that would accompany a news conference by Zelensky, presumably to announce the new investigations.\n\nAD\n\nAsked how he got the White House to finally agree to set dates, Sondland suggested that it isn\u2019t final yet: \u201cI think potus really wants the deliverable\u201d \u2014 again presumably that statement. Shortly after that exchange, Volker contacted Giuliani to get guidance on what the statement should include.\n\nAD\n\nThe next day, Volker and Yermak corresponded by text message with Yermak, with the aide insisting that dates for a visit be set before the statement was released.\n\n\u201cOnce we have a date,\u201d the Zelensky aide wrote, \u201cwill call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAgain, an investigation into Burisma is, in essence, an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s work and an effort to position Joe Biden as having acted unethically. Yermak was promising to uphold his end of the quid pro quo, once a date is set.\n\nOn Aug. 13 \u2014 coincidentally the day after the whistleblower complaint was filed \u2014 Volker sent Sondland what appears to be draft language to include in the statement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSpecial attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians,\u201d the text read \u2014 an additional reference to the release of information implicating then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort in illegal payments in August 2016.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want to declare that this is unacceptable,\u201d Volker wrote, presumably speaking as though he\u2019s Zelensky. \u201cWe intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Sondland replied.\n\nFour days later, Sondland asked whether they still want Burisma and the 2016 elements in the statement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the clear message so far,\u201d Volker replied.\n\nBut the statement doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s not clear why it didn\u2019t \u2014 although it may again be because no date for a meeting with Trump was set.\n\nAD\n\n3. There\u2019s a strong suggestion that military aid was used as leverage \u2014 and hints at an attempt to hide that.\n\nBy the end of August, the Ukrainians had learned that the United States is withholding military aid, a decision made by Trump before the July 25 call. Trump had been scheduled to travel to Poland for an international event but, with Hurricane Dorian threatening Florida and Georgia, he remained in the United States. Vice President Pence went in Trump\u2019s stead and was slated to meet with Zelensky on Sept. 1.\n\nA bit after noon on that day, Taylor, the U.S. official in Ukraine, texted Sondland.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Taylor asked.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCall me,\u201d Sondland replied. And their conversation on that central point was not recorded.\n\nTaylor\u2019s question is a central one to the Trump-Ukraine interaction. There are significant problems that arise if Trump tried to leverage his position and America\u2019s interests to get Ukraine to investigate his political opponents. There are larger problems that arise if Trump halted congressionally approved funding to use it as leverage.\n\nOn Sept. 8, Volker, Taylor and Sondland tried to get on the phone, but Volker couldn\u2019t hear the conversation.\n\n\u201cGordon [Sondland] and I just spoke,\u201d Taylor texted Volker. \u201cI can brief you if you and Gordon don\u2019t connect.\u201d Taylor continued: \u201cThe nightmare is they give the interview and don\u2019t get the security assistance. The Russians love it. (And I quit.)\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s reference to \u201cthe interview\u201d isn\u2019t clear, but he probably means the press announcement about imminent investigations. Taylor was apparently worried that Ukraine would give the interview but the United States would still withhold aid, to Russia\u2019s glee.\n\nEarly the next morning, Taylor again raised his concerns with Sondland.\n\n\u201cThe message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the hold [on the assistance], we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nSondland replied, saying that he \u201cbelieve[s] we have identified the best pathway forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone,\u201d Taylor replied, apparently referring to the failed three-way call on Sept. 8, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nFive hours later, Sondland replies \u2014 using very pointed language.\n\n\u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to read that reply, with its unusual formality and detail, as anything other than an attempt to establish a particular argument for the written record.\n\n\u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text,\u201d he added, reinforcing that interpretation. \u201cIf you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna\u201d \u2014 the State Department\u2019s executive secretary \u2014 \u201cor S\u201d \u2014 perhaps the secretary of state \u2014 \u201ca call to discuss them directly. Thanks.\u201d\n\nNo further text messages were shared.", "description": "Clear quid pro quo. Concerns about military aid.
