Believing interplanetary contamination to be \u201cinevitable,\u201d the team argues that future Martian colonists should use microorganisms to reshape the Red Planet \u2014 a proposition deemed grossly premature by some experts.\n\nIn a paper published last month in FEMS Microbiology Ecology, microbiologist Jose Lopez, a professor at Nova Southeastern University in Florida, along with colleagues W. Raquel Peixoto and Alexandre Rosado from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, proposed a \u201cmajor revision\u201d to current philosophies behind space exploration and planetary protection policies as they pertain to the spread of microorganisms in space.\n\nRather than worry about contaminating foreign celestial bodies \u2014 something NASA and other space agencies take great care to avoid \u2014 Lopez and his co-authors make the case that we should deliberately send our germs to outer space and that the dissemination of our microbes should be part of a larger colonisation strategy to tame the climate on Mars. A key argument proposed by the researchers is that the prevention of contamination is a \u201cnear impossibility,\u201d as the authors phrase it in the study.\n\n\u201cMicrobial introduction should not be considered accidental but inevitable.\u201d\n\nA change in policy like this would run in stark contrast to conventional thinking on the matter. Some of the experts we spoke to said protocols currently in place to prevent us from contaminating another planet are likely working to the best of our knowledge, and we shouldn\u2019t just give up so easily. What\u2019s more, the experts said plenty of science still needs to be done on Mars and elsewhere before we begin to entertain this unrecoverable possibility.\n\nCurrently, the larger scientific community stands in agreement about the need to prevent microbial contamination of planetary bodies like Mars. NASA, ESA and other space agencies carefully and expensively sterilise their instruments prior to launching them toward neighbouring celestial targets.\n\nThe philosophy of planetary protection, or PP, dates back to the late 1950s and the establishment of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), which was set up by the International Council of Scientific Unions. COSPAR, among other matters, develops recommendations and protocols designed to protect space from our microbes. Relatedly, the UN\u2019s Outer Space Treaty, which has been signed by over 100 nations, specifically states:\n\nStates Parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter and, where necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this purpose. If a State Party to the Treaty has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by it or its nationals in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, it shall undertake appropriate international consultations before proceeding with any such activity or experiment.\n\nThe primary rationale behind this thinking is that our germs have the potential to contaminate scientifically important places in the solar system, thus spoiling our ability to detect indigenous microbial life on Mars and other worlds.\n\nFinding traces of DNA or RNA on Mars, for example, wouldn\u2019t automatically mean they originated from Earth, as these molecules could represent a fundamental and ubiquitous building-block of evolution in the Universe. Perhaps even more problematically, it\u2019s feared that invasive Earthly life could snuff out an alien ecosystem before we even have a chance to study it.\n\nOn the other hand, Lopez and his colleagues believe it\u2019ll be next to impossible to prevent our germs from encroaching onto the places we\u2019re exploring, so we might as well have a rational discussion about how to best use microorganisms to our advantage. Specifically, the authors are referring to the prospect of terraforming \u2014 the hypothetical practice of geoengineering a planet to make it more like Earth.\n\nMartian surface as seen from space. (Image: ESA/DLR/FU Berlin)\n\nLooking at Earth\u2019s ancient history as a precedent, the authors acknowledge the critically important role played by microorganisms to foster habitability on our planet, including the production of oxygen, the regulation of gases like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen, and the breaking down of organic and inorganic materials.\n\n\u201cLife as we know it cannot exist without beneficial microorganisms,\u201d said Lopez in an NSU press release. \u201cThey are here on our planet and help define symbiotic associations \u2014 the living together of multiple organisms to create a greater whole. To survive on a barren (and as far as all voyages to date tell us) sterile planets, we will have to take beneficial microbes with us [to Mars]. This will take time to prepare, discern and we are not advocating a rush to inoculate, but only after rigorous, systematic research on earth.\u201d\n\nKey to their argument is the acknowledgement of our transition from explorers to colonists. That life might exist or have existed elsewhere in the solar system appears not to be the case, the authors claim. The \u201clack of any discovery or evidence of life from any of the past 70+ space missions and probes which have left Earth\u2019s orbit points to only one unique presence of life in our immediate solar system,\u201d they write.\n\nLopez and his colleagues contend that, if we\u2019re going to take the colonisation of Mars seriously, we\u2019re going to have to consider the role played by our microbes. But spreading germs around Mars is not to be done indiscriminately and without careful foresight, they say.\n\n\u201cInstead, we envision a deliberate and measured program of research into microbial colonisation, realising the limits of current technologies. Thus, we advocate a conservative schedule of microbial introductions into space, while also realising that human colonisation cannot be separate from microbial introductions.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the researchers are proposing a Proactive Inoculation Plan, or PIP. Such a plan would be put in place prior to any long-term mission and would involve the screening of promising microbial candidates. Dangerous microbes would be discarded, while only the \u201cmost productive\u201d microbes would be included for future missions, as the authors write:\n\nIf humanity is seriously contemplating colonising Mars, another planet or one of the nearby moons in the future, then people need to identify, understand and send the most competitive and beneficial pioneers. Choosing or developing the most durable microbial [species] or communities may be done with deliberation, systematic research and current data, rather than sending random bacteria serendipitously hitchhiking on space stations.\n\nExtremophiles \u2014 microbes capable of living in the harshest environments on Earth \u2014 would be the first microbes dispersed to Mars, likely buried a few feet underground to protect them from the freezing conditions and radiation on the surface.\n\nBut as the authors themselves admit, \u201ctotal control of a full inventory of microbial [species] and their genomes sent into space can never be realistically achieved,\u201d and the \u201cretrieval of microbes once sent may be impossible.\u201d In other words, we\u2019re never going to have full control or knowledge of the process, nor will we be able to stop it once we start.\n\nThe authors offered no specifics in terms of when the first microbes should be planted on Mars, or how long it\u2019ll take for the microorganisms to produce the desired effects \u2014 assuming it\u2019ll even work. It\u2019s an open question, for example, if microbes, even extremophiles, can function on the Martian surface where the exceptionally low air pressure hovers around a paltry 0.7 kPa, which is not too far removed from the conditions found in outer space. The low gravity on Mars along with the intense solar radiation hitting the surface complicate the picture even further.\n\nBut even if it does work, the timescales involved should discourage even the most optimistic would-be Martian colonists. On Earth, these processes required hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of years of patient microbial churning (e.g. the production of oxygen via photosynthesis by cyanobacteria).\n\nBruce Jakosky, a professor of geosciences at the University of Colorado and an expert on the prospect of terraforming Mars, said the authors are proposing some \u201cvery dramatic changes\u201d to the world\u2019s planetary protection protocol, as he wrote in an email to Gizmodo.\n\n\u201cThese [recommendations] seem to run counter to decades of the approach that we\u2019ve taken to PP,\u201d said Jakosky. \u201cI welcome the opportunity to have further discussion of how PP should be implemented and whether changes should be made to it, but I worry about suggestions that recommend such wholescale changes without thoroughly exploring their consequences with an unbiased view.\u201d\n\nPhysicist Todd Huffman from the University of Oxford said the authors committed a fallacy of logic by claiming it\u2019s impossible to completely sterilise a spacecraft on Earth, and so we shouldn\u2019t even try. Huffman believes we should most certainly try and that there\u2019s a very good chance we\u2019re succeeding with our planetary protection schemes, whether that\u2019s thanks to protocols on Earth, the ravaging effects of exposure to deep space, or the harsh conditions already in place on Mars.\n\nAs far as we know, the Curiosity rover did not introduce microbes to Mars. (Image: NASA)\n\n\u201cThere have now been quite a few probes that have landed on the surface of Mars since 1976. All of them have been subject, so far, to the extreme sterilization protocols of COSPAR,\u201d wrote Huffman to Gizmodo in an email. \u201cAnd to this day, none of them have detected Martian \u2014 or Earth \u2014 microbes or evidence of them. Which means that the COSPAR protocols are indeed working. So not only does their argument not hold together on its own merits, their claim that it is impossible to keep contaminants away from a planet like Mars has so far proven unfounded,\u201d he said.\n\nTo which he added: \u201cMy opinion is that if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. The COSPAR protocols appear to be keeping Earth bugs off Mars while we study that planet for any native organisms. We shouldn\u2019t mess with them, unless we wish to tighten them further.\u201d\n\nHuffman doesn\u2019t disagree that eventually we might want to introduce microbes to Mars in the way the authors describe, but it would be \u201ca huge scientific mistake to relax the COSPAR protocols on any world that we have yet to determine to be dead,\u201d requiring us to keep \u201cour bugs off Mars, Europa, Enceladus, and maybe even Titan,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must follow the planetary protection equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: \u2018Above all else, do no harm.\u2019\u201d\n\nSteve Clifford, senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, said he has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the new paper. Ultimately, he believes the potential consequences of making a mistake by easing planetary protection standards \u201cfar outweigh any short-term gains.\u201d We may eventually contaminate Mars, he said, but until then \u201cwe must follow the planetary protection equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: \u2018Above all else, do no harm.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that the potential contamination of an alien biosphere represents a serious ethical concern \u2014 because that is a legacy that we carry with us forever more,\u201d Clifford told Gizmodo in an email. Like Huffman, he\u2019s concerned that Earthly germs could complicate our ability to do science on Mars and said there\u2019s no reason to believe current planetary protection schemes aren\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cIf life has evolved on Mars or the subsurface oceans of the icy moons of the outer planets, then it has likely survived on those bodies for billions of years,\u201d said Clifford. \u201cThe detection of life on any of these bodies would have profound significance in our understanding of the prevalence of life throughout the universe.\u201d\n\nAs for claims that implementing planetary protection protocols are too expensive, Clifford said the associated added costs, which typically amount to around 20 per cent of the mission cost, are worth it.\n\n\u201cAs we explore the potentially habitable environments in our solar system, we need to answer \u2014as definitively as possible \u2014 whether any indigenous life is present, before we ever send humans there,\u201d said Clifford. \u201cAnd, if these environments prove lifeless, then the need for adhering to current planetary protection standards evaporates. However, should we discover life, then I believe that we must have a serious discussion that weighs our desire to colonise and utilise the resources of the solar system against the ethical concern of causing the potential extinction of the very first examples of alien life that we\u2019ve found.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he doesn\u2019t believe a kind of manifest destiny exists to colonise the solar system before we\u2019ve had a chance to conduct a thorough search for alien life, \u201cwhether such a search takes 50 years or several centuries,\u201d he said. Until then, \u201cthere are plenty of lifeless places in the Solar System \u2014 such as the Moon and asteroids \u2014 that humans can explore, colonise, and extract resources from,\u201d said Clifford.\n\nLopez and his colleagues have obviously hit upon a sore spot. None of the experts we spoke to had major objections in terms of the use of microbes as part of the colonisation and terraforming process at some future juncture. Rather, they were irked by the claim that we\u2019re on the verge of transitioning from the exploration stage to the colonisation stage and that we should start mobilising our resources \u2014 and our microbial assets \u2014 accordingly.\n\nAs we approach an era in which we\u2019re capable of sending humans to the Red Planet, this debate will undoubtedly continue to be a heated one.", "description": "A research team is proposing a major philosophical shift in our thinking about the spread of Earthly microbes in space and on Mars in particular.
