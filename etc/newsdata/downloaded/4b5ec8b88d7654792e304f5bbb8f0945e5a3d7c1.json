(AP) - The Seattle Seahawks could be without starting offensive linemen Duane Brown and D.J. Fluker for Sunday\u2019s game at Cleveland.\n\nBrown and Fluker were both listed as doubtful on Friday\u2019s injury report. Fluker left Seattle\u2019s game against the Los Angeles Rams with a hamstring injury, while Brown has played through a biceps injury for a couple of weeks.\n\nCoach Pete Carroll said Brown\u2019s injury is uncomfortable and has not responded the way Seattle hoped. Carroll did not definitively rule out either player against the Browns, but the Seahawks could have some significant shuffling on the offensive line if both can\u2019t go.\n\nConverted tackle Jamarco Jones would likely start at right guard in place of Fluker, with George Fant stepping in at left tackle if Brown can\u2019t play.\n\nThe Seahawks added depth by signing offensive lineman Jordan Roos and tight end Jacob Hollister from the practice squad before leaving for Cleveland. Seattle placed offensive lineman Ethan Pocic on injured reserve due to a lingering back injury after he was unable to participate in practice this week. Seattle also waived safety Adrian Colbert.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Seattle Seahawks could be without starting offensive linemen Duane Brown and D.J.
