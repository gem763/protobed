Snell was working as a teacher focused on students with learning disabilities at Thoreau Middle School in Vienna.\n\nFairfax County police said they began investigating Snell on Thursday after parents found inappropriate text messages from Snell to a teen and reported it to the school. Police declined to say whether the victim was a student at Thoreau.\n\nPolice said Snell became aware of the investigation and left the area as arrest warrants were being authorized. He was tracked to El Paso, where he was taken into custody.\n\nAuthorities plan to seek to extradite Snell to Fairfax County to face charges of carnal knowledge of a child and taking indecent liberties with a child by a person in a custodial relationship.\n\nPolice asked anyone who may have additional information about inappropriate contact between Snell and students to call detectives at 703-246-7800.\n\nFairfax County schools officials said they were in the process of terminating Snell\u2019s employment.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Matthew Snell, 31, was taken into custody at the El Paso International Airport, police said.", "authors": ["Justin Jouvenal", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Policing", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yLLRfQJ9SZio5yjbs9S7rS0gTu0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PIRSLRSBBEI6TE3BGAP7WW6V4Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
