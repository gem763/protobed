The 36-year-old has worked in sales and bill collection. The associate\u2019s degree holder has been in customer support, teaching and nursing too.\n\nBut the self-professed \u201cjack of all trades\u201d from Monck\u2019s Corner, S.C., is done with the chase for the next gig. \u201cI just want a job that has benefits, and I never have to be in this position again.\u201d\n\nBack in the mid-2000s, Maple had a job she loved working for Comcast CMCSA, -3.15%. It started as customer support and turned into a sales position. Maple earned about $15 an hour, had benefits and bonuses on her sales. The 20-minute commute was easy and she enjoyed talking to customers. \u201cI loved my job,\u201d she said.\n\nThen she had her daughter in 2009.\n\nCourtesy Kimberly Maple Kimberly Maple\n\nMaple, a single mom, was back on the job after two months of paid maternity leave. Maple\u2019s mother, a corrections officer, worked a night shift and took care of Maple\u2019s newborn during the day. The arrangement lasted a year until Maple\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t swap shifts with co-workers on a regular basis.\n\nMaple told her mother, Loraine, she\u2019d figure out another arrangement for her one-year-old. So Maple checked out child-care prices. The cheapest rates were $135 a week. Maple ultimately decided to quit her job and work from home.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy choice, she said. \u201cI was very scared [because] I didn\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d she remembers.\n\nMaple is far from the only parent who\u2019s had to make a choice between work and child care. In 2016, almost 2 million parents of children ages 5 and younger had to quit their job, refuse an employment offer or switch their job because they had a child care issue, according to the left-leaning Center for American Progress.\n\nLast year, annual day care costs for an infant and a 4-year-old were cheapest in the South ($17,193) and most expensive in the Northeast ($24,815), according to Child Care Aware of America. Prices might be cheaper around Maple, but $17,000 still isn\u2019t cheap.\n\nSouth Carolina families could use better access to day care, according to information from ZERO TO THREE, an organization focusing on early childhood. Families there are less likely to take advantage of available resources: 3.1% of South Carolina toddlers from low- and moderate-income families are in federally subsidized child care programs, the organization said; the national average is 4.2%. Some parts of Berkeley County, where Maple lives, have no licensed child care providers and are considered \u201cchild care deserts,\u201d a 2018 study by the Center for American Progress found.\n\nFamilies shouldn\u2019t spend more than 7% of their income on child care, according to a 2016 recommendation by the Department of Health and Human Services, but there\u2019s no state in the country where parents can follow that recommendation, according to Child Care Aware of America. The advocacy group suggests that parents look for child care vouchers, scholarships and state-funded pre-K programs to help save money.\n\nMaple began working from home, making $9 an hour. Through her third-party employer, Maple collected payments from Sprint S, -2.13% customers. She had a hard time making ends meet. Her car was repossessed and her credit score dropped. \u201cI lost a lot of stuff, but I made sure I paid the rent and my lights.\u201d\n\nShe held the job for two years, before moving on to become a triage nurse at an urgent care clinic.\n\nMaple worked there for more than five years, and felt like she was regaining her footing. It didn\u2019t last long.\n\nWhile she was on leave with her newborn son in 2015, the practice suddenly shut down. \u201cIt was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, back to square one,\u201d she said \u2014 except now she had two kids, not one.\n\n\u2018It was still a tight spot, but it would be cheaper to stay home.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was still a tight spot, but it would be cheaper to stay home,\u201d Maple said.\n\nSo that\u2019s what she did, running up $6,000 in credit card debt along the way.\n\nBy 2017, after some efforts at event planning, Maple heard child care jobs could give discounts on child care.\n\nMaple wanted her boy to be around other kids, so she landed a job as a teacher in a day care center. She earned $10.50 an hour, without benefits, and paid a discounted $400 monthly day care bill. Though her job gave a $50 monthly allowance, Maple chipped in her own money for supplies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s never enough, especially with what we do with the kids,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile she worked full-time, raising two children and expecting a third, Kimberly earned her associate degree in human services, She received her diploma in May from Trident Technical College in Charleston, S.C.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: These teachers are spending their own money to help improve their classes\n\nDespite the tight budget, Maple was able to pay off her debts, at least temporarily. She brought lunch from home, carpooled to save money on gas, and used her tax refund checks to pay down debts.\n\nMaple left the day care job in July and gave birth to her daughter in August. She\u2019s ready for another career, this time something steady and with benefits. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fall back into the same cycle,\u201d she said.\n\nMaple\u2019s also been studying the stock market. She hopes to invest one day so she can build income outside of work. She\u2019s taken on about $5,000 more in credit-card debt \u2014 for household necessities, she added.\n\nBut Maple\u2019s confident she\u2019ll pay it off once she gets back to work. Maple considers herself an \u201coptimist\u201d who\u2019s become stronger over the years. \u201cI look at the positive in everything,\u201d she said.", "description": "\u2018It was still a tight spot, but it would be cheaper to stay at home.\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR989_Mom_ZG_20190924220031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
