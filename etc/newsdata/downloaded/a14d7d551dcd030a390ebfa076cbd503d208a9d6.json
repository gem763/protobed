The firm initiated coverage of WeWork last month with a $28 billion valuation.\n\n\"Maybe if WeWork had come out before Lyft and Uber, they would have got a pass. But now, seeing how the appetite for companies without a path to profitability has gone down, I don't think they will get the benefit of the doubt,\" Rao said.\n\nBoth Uber and Lyft have stumbled out of the gate following their public-market debuts earlier this year. Many investors from later private rounds are now in the red, as the stocks have fallen 24% and 43%, respectively, in the months since.\n\nOther criticisms, like the appearance of self-dealing in the $5.9 million purchase of a trademark from CEO Adam Neumann that was later canceled or a complicated corporate-governance structure, have put more pressure on WeWork to fully justify its lofty valuation targets, Rao said.\n\nRead more: These are the unusual ways WeWork founder Adam Neumann has made millions, and stands to make more, from his $47 billion company about to go public\n\n\"When you're a private company, maybe you can get away [with these things] because you have time to explain to investors what the long-term vision is, and people look past the small things in favor of a broader vision of where the company's gong and what the future potential is,\" he said.\n\n\"But when you're a public company, you have to execute and you have to perform,\" he added.\n\nThen there's the recession question.\n\nMany companies are seen as flocking to public markets in order to raise capital before the long-running economic expansion reaches an eventual end, with WeWork proving to be no exception.\n\n\"They have to make sure the leases are rock-solid,\" Rao said. \"Forty percent of the base is enterprise clients, which puts a floor on that, depending on how long the downturn is. Mature markets are doing well, but they will need to venture beyond just the most major of cities.\"\n\nWeWork is expected to kick off its roadshow, when executives and bankers will travel around the world to pitch the stock to investors, as soon as next week, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The offering could be the second-largest this year, behind Uber.\n\nMore on WeWork's IPO:", "description": "Manhattan Venture Partners pegs WeWork's value at $28 billion, near the same amount the real-estate company is said to be considering.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72a8a62e22af208b1c502d-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
