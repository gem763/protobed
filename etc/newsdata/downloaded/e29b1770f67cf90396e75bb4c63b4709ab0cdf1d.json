The original proposal was to build levees that would run parallel to FM 3005 on Galveston Island and Texas 87 on Bolivar Peninsula but behind the dune line. This plan for the harder barrier would have left thousands of homes adjacent to the beach exposed to flooding and likely required extensive eminent domain buyouts.\n\nThe update is more ambitious than \u201cthe so-called \u201cIke Dike ,\u201d proposed by Texas A&M; researchers and named for the 2008 hurricane that flooded parts of Galveston.\n\nThe change to natural sand dunes has been mostly embraced by experts as the most practical and politically expedient next step for storm surge mitigation, even with the project\u2019s substantial price tag.\n\nBut questions have been raised about the dunes\u2019 cost, in addition to how much protection they can provide to coastal communities in the event of a powerful tropical storm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a dune system that runs along the existing dune line,\u201d Kelly Burks-Copes, the Corps\u2019 project manager, said of the current plan. \u201cBasically, it\u2019s just one solid continuous line, with beach access still afforded, with drive-overs and walk-overs, in compliance with the Open Beaches Act.\u201d\n\nThe dunes could also alleviate the continued erosion of the Texas coastline due to sea level increases and sediment moving from coastal tributaries. The Bureau of Economic Geology, which monitors shoreline changes along the Texas coast, estimates that parts of Galveston and Bolivar have lost 5 to 8 feet of shoreline over the last 80 years.\n\nWhile strengthening the coast\u2019s natural barriers would be less troublesome to coastal property owners, dunes present challenges of their own. The Corps has acknowledged the dunes will not protect coastal residents from all storms and will not be as strong as a levee.\n\nEnvironmentalists also noted a sand dune could contribute to habitat loss for endangered species, such as the Kemp\u2019s Ridley sea turtle.\n\nThe Corps will submit a final proposal for the coastal barrier to Congress for funding in 2021.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Houston Chronicle, http://www.houstonchronicle.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Army Corps of Engineers has proposed 14-foot-high natural sand dunes in the latest version of its up to $32 billion plan for protecting the Houston and Galveston areas from hurricane-related storm surges.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
