In his 2017 Super Bowl day interview with Fox News, he dismissed criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \u201ckiller\u201d by musing: \u201cThere are a lot of killers. We\u2019ve got a lot of killers. What, do you think, our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d\n\nIf such a statement were made by an Ivy League college professor, conservatives would have had all their suspicions about the anti-American tendencies of tenured radicals confirmed. Yet Republicans seem to have no problem rallying around a politician who looks at the Russian-American relationship and sees equal and opposite amorality.\n\nThe assertion of moral equivalence between the Voice of America and Russian troll farms is particularly ignorant and galling. The VOA does actual newsgathering and journalism in countries without a free press. The Russians deliver lies on social media to encourage division and hatred among Americans. Trump seems incapable of understanding the difference.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor all his flag waving, Trump seems to lack the instinct for patriotism. It is one thing \u2014 as the president does with regularity \u2014 to throw people who work for him under the bus. This displays the absence of downward loyalty. But in his 2017 meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, Trump effectively threw his country under the bus \u2014 endorsing the Russian perception of American hypocrisy on election tampering. This indicates a lack of upward loyalty. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter to Trump that American \u201cmeddling\u201d in foreign elections generally consists of promoting regular and fair elections, encouraging the protection of minority rights and speaking up for press freedom.\n\nNone of these objectives holds much appeal or urgency for Trump. He calls for the renewal of nationalism, but in a manner that has little to do with our national values. He wants us to take pride in blood and soil rather than in a set of universal ideals. His calls for loyalty are based on geography not morality. He urges us to love America because it is powerful, and because it is ours, not because it is good.\n\nIn this sense, Trump seeks to normalize American nationalism \u2014 to make it more like the Russian or Chinese varieties. He invariably defines national goals in terms of exercising military dominance, or controlling access to resources, or maintaining national sovereignty, or achieving trade surpluses. And he seems to view this as an expression of realism about the nature of power. America may claim to be a new order for the ages, but we kill people too. We interfere with elections too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump appears to find this kind of moral relativism liberating. A world without rules and ideals is a world without limits on his instincts and whims. This may be why he has offered praise for the leadership styles of Putin or Chinese President Xi Jinping, while generally ignoring democratic activists in Moscow or Hong Kong. Trump would rather view himself as the embodiment of the national will, instead of as the steward of American ideals. His sympathies lie with the powerful because he imagines himself in their company.\n\nDespite this pretense, Trump manages to look small and silly on the global stage. He has been tricked and exploited again and again by North Korea\u2019s murderous man-child. At the Helsinki summit last year, standing next to Putin, Trump was cringing and pathetic. When it comes to foreign policy, he is not sitting at the adult table.\n\nBut the most alarming spectacle is this: an American president who doesn\u2019t understand the meaning of America.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .\n\nRead more:\n\nMax Boot: Trump isn\u2019t loyal to Russia \u2014 or America.
