The result is an intriguing but somewhat muddled multi-part series, distinguished by a producer roster that includes directors Steven Spielberg and Alex Gibney.\n\nDespite qualms about the focus, it's still possible to applaud the effort and high-minded motives, and there's plenty of food for thought buried in the episodes previewed. Journalist/author Jelani Cobb, for example, points out that social media has created \"tools that make it easier to get people to behave in ways that are inhumane, that are hateful.\"\n\nAn episode titled \"Origins,\" meanwhile, includes evolutionary anthropologist Brian Hare, who examines the divergent behavior of humans' closest cousins, chimpanzees and bonobos. The former, notably, developed in a region where resources were scarce, and became more territorial and warlike, while the latter had a much easier time finding food, leading to peaceful interactions.\n\nFood for thought, indeed.\n\nFrom there, though, \"Why We Hate\" is somewhat shackled by the broadness of its subject matter, which ranges from the prevalence of bullying across societies to the rise of hate groups, as well as efforts to wean neo-Nazis and other extremists away from those beliefs and actions.\n\nRead More", "description": "Steven Spielberg and Alex Gibney documentary series examines roots of tribalism and violence on Discovery Channel", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008120522-why-we-hate-discovery-channel-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
