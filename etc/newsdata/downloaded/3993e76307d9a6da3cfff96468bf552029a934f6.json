The map appeared to have been changed to follow claims Trump posted Sunday on Twitter that the state would \"likely be hit (much) harder\" by the storm than models at the time suggested.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Birmingham clarified that day that Alabama was not in the storm's path.\n\nBut Trump has stood his ground, and now the NOAA appears to have taken Trump's side in the six-day imbroglio.\n\nIn its carefully worded and unsigned Friday statement, the federal agency contradicted the Birmingham National Weather Service, saying the Alabama-based office \"spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\"\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/169/1155968404_6083737993001_6083745742001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe statement said NOAA had provided the White House information from Aug. 28 through Sept. 2 that tropical storm winds from the hurricane could affect Alabama. The map Trump used was a 5-day forecast by the National Hurricane Center issued on Aug. 29 \u2014 in which the agency never predicted the storm would hit Alabama.\n\nThe president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization, Dan Sobien, responded in a tweet: \"Let me assure you the hard working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous tweet sent out by NOAA management tonight #NOAA.\"\n\nAt the time of Trump\u2019s initial tweet, the most recent forecast from the National Hurricane Center showed that a sliver of the state had a less than 10 percent chance of seeing tropical storm-force winds.\n\nIt's not the first time a federal agency has come to Trump's defense after the president was criticized for making dubious claims. Repeatedly, the officially non-partisan federal bureaucracy has been called to the president\u2019s defense.\n\nInauguration crowds\n\n\n\nIn the early days of the Trump administration, the president and his then-press secretary Sean Spicer claimed that the inauguration had the largest crowd in American history \u2014 a claim swiftly debunked by photos tweeted by the National Park Service comparing the Trump inauguration and that of President Barack Obama.\n\nTrump later called the Park Service, urging it to find photos supporting his claim of having the largest inauguration size and expressing anger over the tweet, The Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nClimate change and the environment\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, Trump \u2014 during his first month in office \u2014 banned the EPA from giving social media updates or speaking with reporters. These restrictions were mimicked by the Agriculture and Health and Human Services departments.\n\nPOLITICO reported the no-media rule was accompanied by bans on the phrases \u201cClimate Change,\u201d \u201cEmissions Reduction\u201d and \u201cParis Agreement\u201d from all communications. Coinciding with Trump\u2019s campaign promises, the workers were prompted to use the new preferred words: \u201cjobs\u201d and \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe border wall\n\n\n\nTrump said in 2018 that \u201ctremendous amounts\u201d of his promised border wall had been built. That wasn\u2019t true: The Border Patrol was replacing old barriers with new ones.\n\nStill, DHS took up the narrative. In June 2018, they tweeted: \u201cjust as he promised, the border wall has begun construction.\u201d Except the plan they linked to had been in the works since 2009 and did not include construction of Trump\u2019s wall.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It announced nearly 4,000 people on the FBI terror watch list were stopped as they tried to enter the U.S. \u2014 but DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen didn\u2019t point out that was a worldwide number and most of them were apprehended at airports.\n\nCensus question\n\n\n\nAfter Trump failed to get a citizenship question on the 2020 Census, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, defended Trump's contradictory claims that the administration was still pushing for the question to be added to the census.\n\nA few days after the Supreme Court refused in June to allow census officials to add the question without further justification, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the administration would drop its plans to ask for respondents' citizenship. But Trump shortly after tweeted that he was going to pursue the question regardless, and Justice and Commerce Department officials later confirmed they were considering pursuing the question in court.\n\nMass shootings\n\n\n\nMore recently, after the mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, Health and Human Services staffers were reined in to prevent any contradictions to Trump's claims linking mental health and gun violence. HHS staffers were ordered not to post anything to social media related to mental health and mass shootings without prior approval, The Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nTrump insisted that repairing mental health was an under-discussed cause of gun violence and pushed for an overhaul of the nation's mental health system.", "description": "Repeatedly, the officially non-partisan federal bureaucracy has been called to the president\u2019s defense.", "authors": ["Matthew Choi", "Rishika Dugyala"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bd/96/21016e80406a935a0bdbbef1ebba/20190906-trump-speaks-agencies-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
