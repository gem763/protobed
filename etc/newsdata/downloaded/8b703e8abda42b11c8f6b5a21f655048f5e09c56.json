This could trigger an acceleration to the upside with the next major target the all-time high at 3029.50.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nA sustained move under 2932.50 will signal the presence of sellers. This could lead to a labored break with potential support levels coming in at 2902.50, 2880.75 and 2845.75.\n\nTaking out 2845.75 will indicate the selling is getting stronger. This could lead to a test of the minor bottom at 2810.25.
