UPDATE 1-Canada's Trudeau campaigns after blackface images deliver blow to polling numbers\n\n(Adds pollster comments, updates poll numbers)\n\nBy David Ljunggren\n\nOTTAWA, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau returned to the campaign trail on Sunday in his bid for re-election in October as polls showed his Liberals took a significant hit with voters after photos emerged of him in blackface.\n\nTrudeau has repeatedly apologized for the photos, which jarred with his oft-stated position that he wants to improve the lot of minorities in Canada and prompted accusations of hypocrisy.\n\nTrudeau was headed for the Ontario city of Brampton, where 58% of the population is either south Asian or black. The Liberals took all five of Brampton's seats in 2015 and need to retain them to stand a chance of winning the Oct. 21 election.\n\nBefore the photos emerged last week, surveys of public opinion strongly suggested Trudeau would beat the opposition Conservatives of Andrew Scheer, who is a legislator.\n\nNow the polls have shifted and the Liberals are looking particularly vulnerable in Ontario, said pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research, who said he would release his exact survey figures later this week.\n\nThe day before the pictures emerged, \"the Liberals were at or very close to a majority\" in the House of Commons, Graves said. \"That's completely turned around and maybe the Conservatives are in majority range now.\"\n\n\"The Liberals' Ontario lead appears to have evaporated almost overnight,\" he added. At the end of August, the Liberals had a 15 percentage point lead on Conservatives Ontario, according to an EKOS poll.\n\nConservatives would now win 35.5% of the vote and the Liberals 32.9%, a Nanos Research poll released on Sunday said. theme of Trudeau's campaign stop in Brampton is making life more affordable for Canadians, which had been one of the main thrusts of the campaign before the photo scandal. Minister Chrystia Freeland is due to attend a Toronto town hall hosted by the National Council of Canadian Muslims on Sunday. The council has accepted Trudeau's apology after initially issued an angry statement.\n\nFreeland has said she was saddened by the photos but stressed she fully backed Trudeau. Other Liberal legislators and candidates have also expressed unhappiness.\n\nInsiders have dismissed the idea of anyone in the party mounting a challenge against Trudeau during the campaign, saying that would be tantamount to electoral suicide.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Canada's Trudeau campaigns after blackface images deliver blow to polling numbers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA8F0U5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
