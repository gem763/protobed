The models replaced the similarly priced iPhone XS, XS Max and XR, respectively.\n\nIn typical Apple fashion, the company played up improvements to the battery life, camera system and hardware under the hood of the new phones. But on the surface, the new iPhones do not look radically different than the previous year.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max models feature an improved camera system, with three cameras on the back of the phone, and better battery life than previous models. Apple says the iPhone 11 Pro will last four hours longer than the iPhone XS and the iPhone 11 Pro Max will last five hours longer than the iPhone XS Max.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook called the Pro models \"the most powerful and most advanced iPhones we have ever built, with a stunning design.\" And the company is asking customers to pay up for them.\n\nRead More", "description": "Apple unveiled its new smartphone lineup which includes the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone 11 Pro Max and the iPhone 11.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Seth Fiegerman", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190910135448-20190910-apple-event-iphone-11-02-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
