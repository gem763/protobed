REUTERS/Yiannis Kourtoglou\n\nLARNACA, Cyprus (Reuters) - A 96-year-old celebrated his birthday on Saturday by breaking his own record as the world\u2019s oldest active scuba diver for the third year running, plunging to the depths of the equivalent of a 15-storey building to explore a shipwreck off Cyprus.\n\nWorld War Two veteran Ray Woolley, who turned 96 on Aug. 28, plunged to a depth of 42.4 meters for 48 minutes, the event organizers said. He beat his previous record of 40.6 meters for 44 minutes.\n\n\u201cIts just unbelievable. I\u2019ve been diving now for 59 years and these are the sort of dives that you remember because there are so many divers with you,\u201d Woolley said, of the other 47 divers who swam with him.\n\n\u201cIf I can still dive and my buddies are willing to dive with me I hope I can do it again next year,\u201d Woolley told Reuters after the event organized by the Larnaca municipality and the town\u2019s tourism board.\n\nWoolley, who lives in Cyprus, was a radio operator in World War Two. Has successively broken two previous records he held in 2017 and 2018. He is originally from Port Sunlight in northwest England.\n\nThe Zenobia, a cargo vessel laden with trucks that sank off of Larnaca in 1980, is a popular dive site. Underwater images showed Woolley and other divers sitting on the hull of the submerged ship as fish, and the occasional turtle, swam by.\n\nA documentary on his life, \u201cLife Begins at 90\u201d, will be shown at the Bosnia-Herzegovina film festival in September.\n\n\u201cI refuse to accept the fact that I\u2019m getting old,\u201d Woolley says in the trailer.", "description": "A 96-year-old celebrated his birthday on Saturday by breaking his own record as the world's oldest active scuba diver for the third year running, plunging to the depths of the equivalent of a 15-storey building to explore a shipwreck off Cyprus.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190831&t=2&i=1424786600&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7U0LX"}
