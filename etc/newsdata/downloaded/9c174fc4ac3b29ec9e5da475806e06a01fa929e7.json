I was banked a lot, but it was one part of the incident that I was thinking to just give up.\n\n\"I was thinking to give up, but then I say 'before giving up, open gas, see what happens'.\n\n\"When I opened the gas, it's when I had that kind of reaction from the bike that was kind of like a wheelie, and I was able to save it.\"\n\nMarquez joked his younger brother Alex's save during a wet Japanese GP Moto2 practice \"motivated him\" to do a better one.\n\nMarquez: No problem with Lorenzo after FP2 touch\n\nMarquez almost 'gave up' trying to save test crash More\n\nIn the closing stages of FP2, Marquez came across team-mate Jorge Lorenzo touring on the racing line while the world champion was on a flying lap.\n\nThe pair made slight contact as Marquez passed around the outside of the Turn 11 left-hander, breaking part of the wing on Lorenzo's bike, and prompting Marquez to vent his frustration towards him on the cooldown lap.\n\nMarquez says tensions have now been diffused after the pair met to discuss what happened, but urged riders not to ride \"in a slow mode\" on the racing line.\n\n\"In the first moment, I was upset because we cannot forget that FP means QP - you need to go directly to QP2,\" he said.\n\n\"The forecast tomorrow looks like it will rain. [That lap] was my last chance, I was on a very fast lap, I tried to overtake him in the best way for me to not lose time.\n\n\"But in the end we need to pay attention because we cannot ride in a slow mode in the middle of the [racing] line.\n\n\"Of course, he did not have more space [to use], but you need to check behind and be out of the line.\n\n\"Apart from this, I was angry in the moment, but then we spoke together, [and there are] no problems.\"\n\nLorenzo felt Marquez did not need to run as close as he did to him, but acknowledged he did not need to be as slow on the racing line.\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Marc Marquez says he almost gave up trying to save a crash in a tyre test during MotoGP Australian Grand Prix practice on Friday", "authors": ["Lewis Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dEOhLuGHraeD_V8abME52w--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/8efcfcd94b86f6d04e711226c067b888", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
