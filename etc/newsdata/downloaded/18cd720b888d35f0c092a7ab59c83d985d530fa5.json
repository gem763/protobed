They gotta dress me up in a lot of heavy armor. I'll look too heavy. I don't like that,\" Trump said when asked if he would throw out the first pitch to open the game. Should he finish his time in office without throwing a first pitch, Trump would be the first president to do so since William Howard Taft began the tradition in 1910.\n\nThe honor of throwing out the first pitch on Sunday, should the game be played, will instead go to renowned chef, activist, and vocal Trump critic Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s.\n\nWhile Andr\u00e9s expressed that he was honored to accept the Nationals invitation, he added that he hoped his presence wouldn't be necessary, as Washington could potentially sweep the Astros before a Game 5 is ever played.\n\nAndr\u00e9s had criticized Trump since the beginning of his presidential campaign. In 2015, the star chef was set to open a restaurant in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., but pulled out of the agreement after Trump's racist remarks against Mexicans at the start of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nTrump sued, and Andr\u00e9s countersued, and after two years, the two sides settled.\n\nSince then, Andr\u00e9s has continued to speak out against the president while doing plenty of good work. Andr\u00e9s and his nonprofit World Central Kitchen have served millions of meals to people whose lives have been devastated by natural disasters, including Hurricane Maria in 2017 and Hurricane Dorian this year.\n\nAndr\u00e9s also committed to feeding federal workers during the government shutdown at the start of 2019, giving out more than 38,000 meals to unpaid employees who had missed paychecks due to the stoppage.\n\nAndr\u00e9s and Trump won't even have the chance to attend the game unless the Nationals lose on Friday or Saturday. But should a Game 5 be necessary, it will be worth it to make time for the first pitch.\n\nChampionship teams visiting the White House has turned into a mess \u2014 here is how Trump and the teams have wrecked the tradition\n\nPence blasts Nike for pushing its 'social-justice champion' reputation while 'checking its social conscience at the door' by ignoring China's actions in Hong Kong\n\nAn 8-year-old girl climbed an 18-foot replica of Donald Trump's 'un-climbable' border wall in seconds\n\nTrump walks out to Metallica's 'Enter Sandman' to present Medal of Freedom to Yankees Hall of Famer Mariano Rivera", "description": "Trump implied he was uninterested in throwing out the first pitch at Sunday's potential Game 5 because he would \"look too heavy.\"", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db2fcdbdee0190273480172?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
