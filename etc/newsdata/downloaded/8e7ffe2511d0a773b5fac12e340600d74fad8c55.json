A Treasury Department statement said the vessel was being used to transport 2.1 million barrels of Iranian crude oil for the benefit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard - a branch of the country's armed forces the US has designated a terrorist organisation.\n\nWhat did the emails say?\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Mr Hook sent an email to the Indian captain of the Adrian Darya 1, Akhilesh Kumar, before it imposed sanctions on the ship.\n\n\"I am writing with good news,\" the email read. The Trump administration was willing to pay the captain several million dollars to take the ship somewhere it could be seized by US authorities.\n\nThe emails reportedly carried a state department phone number to make sure the captain - who took over the ship after it was impounded - did not think they were fake.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC obtained footage of the inside of the tanker when it was detained in Gibraltar\n\nMr Hook told the newspaper that the state department was \"working very closely with the maritime community to disrupt and deter illicit oil exports\".\n\nMr Kumar ignored the emails. The US then imposed sanctions on him personally when they blacklisted the Adrian Darya 1.\n\nOn Twitter, Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif accused the US of \"outright bribery\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @JZarif Having failed at piracy, the US resorts to outright blackmail\u2014deliver us Iran\u2019s oil and receive several million dollars or be sanctioned yourself.\n\n\n\nSounds very similar to the Oval Office invitation I received a few weeks back.\n\n\n\nIt is becoming a pattern.#BTeamGangsters pic.twitter.com/B1oQTLghWZ \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) September 4, 2019 Report\n\nThe Trump administration announced on Wednesday new sanctions on an Iranian shipping network used to sell oil, and offered $15m to anyone who can help to disrupt the system.\n\nWhat is the tanker row?\n\nThe Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, was detained by British authorities in Gibraltar on 4 July after it was suspected of moving oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions.\n\nIt was released on 15 August after Iran gave assurances it would not discharge its cargo in Syria - despite the last-minute US effort to prevent its release.\n\nTracking websites indicate the ship is currently in the eastern Mediterranean, although it has reportedly turned off its signalling device.\n\nIts initial seizure sparked a diplomatic crisis between the UK and Iran, which saw Iran seize a British-flagged and Swedish-owned oil tanker, the Stena Impero, in the Gulf.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iran said it would free seven of the Stena Impero's 23 crew members on humanitarian grounds.", "description": "The offer was made to the ship at the centre of an international row, the state department confirms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4BCA/production/_108620491_tv055916162.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
