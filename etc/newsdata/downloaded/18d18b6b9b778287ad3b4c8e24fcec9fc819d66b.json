We had a similar incident three or four years ago.\n\n\"We had a lorry pull up opposite where our unit is. The driver got out, opened up the back and about 20 people got out and ran off up the road.\n\n\"The thing is it\u2019s such a quiet area and of an evening it\u2019s very dark. I believe the police are looking at our CCTV going forward.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I just feel for the people and their families who have struggled to get into the UK for whatever reasons.\n\n\"They\u2019re feeling they\u2019re coming here for a better life and they\u2019ve paid the ultimate price for that.\"\n\nPolice have now launched a desperate hunt for the trafficking gang responsible for the tragedy.\n\nTony Smith, the former head of Border Force, said they will have used safe houses across Europe.\n\nHe said: \"It\u2019s very unusual on two fronts. Firstly it appears to be a sealed container which is very, very dangerous and very unusual.\n\n\u201cI only remember one incident before. These things can be sealed and left in ports for a very long, long time.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t ever in 40 years known for a large consignment of migrants to be smuggled in on that route. It raises questions for me.\n\n\u201cThis will be irregular migrants probably smuggled in from outside the EU.\n\n\u201cOnce inside the EU there would have been a series of safe houses that would move them up towards the coastline.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe said smugglers have all but given up on using Calais because it has been \u201csealed up\u201d by UK and French authorities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in recent years increasingly different and dangerous methods of human smugglers trying to get people in,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cFor the last year we\u2019ve seen small boats and people drowning.\n\n\u201cNow these containers are being used which suggests smugglers and migrants are getting more and more desperate. It\u2019s a dreadful business.\u201d\n\nThere are hopes the smugglers may have left a paper-trail of forms submitted to the Zeebrugge and Thurrock port authorities.\n\n\u201cThere will be an audit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure enforcement agencies and police will be looking at this.\u201d\n\n(Image: PHILIPPE HUGUEN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAnthony Steen, chairman of the Human Trafficking Foundation, said the migrants were likely from Afghanistan or Syria.\n\nHe also claimed they probably rushed their decision to get into the UK over Brexit fears.\n\n\u201cThese are people desperate to get away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are likely to be trafficked with deception and the belief they could get in safely.\n\n\u201cIt shows up a problem likely to be accelerating over the next few weeks and months - that is confusion about Brexit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite sure the people in the back of the lorry were deceived into thinking they better get into Britain quickly because of Brexit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure others will go the same route. They don\u2019t have the knowledge that Brexit won\u2019t affect them.\u201d\n\nGangsters rake in millions of pounds sending migrants on hellish 90-hour journeys in the back of lorries to the UK.\n\n(Image: PHILIPPE HUGUEN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPolice said the numbers being smuggled into Britain inside containers and trailers has soared in the last year.\n\nThe National Crime Agency said in May there had been \u201cincreasing use of higher risk methods of clandestine entry\u201d by organised gangs.\n\nSenior detectives warned the use of \u201crefrigerated HGVs\u201d posed a \u201chigh risk to life\u201d of those migrants smuggled.\n\nIn a separate report the NCA highlighted Zeebrugge as a major hub used by smugglers hiding people in lorries.\n\nThe 39 migrants found dead in Grays arrived in the UK on a ferry from the Belgian port in the early hours of yesterday.\n\nThere are fears they were driven for days across Europe in the refrigerated unit by a smuggling gang who loaded it onto a ship.\n\nThe trailer was collected in Thurrock by the Bulgarian-registered and Irish-owned truck before being driven to Grays.\n\nBulgaria is a popular \u2018gateway\u2019 into Europe for desperate migrants fleeing war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSmuggling gangs operating in the mountainous area bordering Serbia have long-trafficked asylum seekers looking to start a new life.\n\nMillions of migrants have entered Bulgaria from neighbouring Turkey over the past five years through the so-called \u2018Balkan Route\u2019.\n\nBut the country, the EU\u2019s poorest, is anti-immigration and has made it clear they are not welcome to stay.\n\nInstead migrants are preyed on by criminal gangs who charge them up to \u00a33,000 each to be smuggled across Europe.\n\nMost are helped through Bulgaria before crossing the Serbian border where they are met by other traffickers.\n\n(Image: PHILIPPE HUGUEN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHowever others are put into Bulgarian-registered lorries and driven across Europe in containers.\n\nLast year 12 Bulgarians were jailed for their role in the deaths of 71 migrants who suffocated in a sealed lorry in Austria.\n\nPolice found the victims\u2019 decomposing bodies in the lorry, registered in Hungary and abandoned near an Austrian village.\n\nAfghan national Samsoor Lahoo, 31, identified as the gang leader got 25 years, as did three Bulgarian accomplices, including the driver.\n\nTen others, all but one from Bulgaria, got shorter jail terms after being convicted of people-smuggling.\n\nThe victims came from Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Iran and included eight women and four children.\n\nOfficials said they were crammed so tightly into the back of a small Volvo meat lorry they were unable to sit down.\n\nThey are believed to have suffocated less than three hours after the lorry set off.\n\nAccording to prosecutors the smugglers knew that the migrants squeezed into the back were going to die.\n\nThey ignored the sound of them banging on the sealed interior as the oxygen ran out.\n\n(Image: Wikimedia Commons/Marc Ryckaert)\n\nIn June a massive Bulgarian-based smuggling ring was smashed after police raids in Sofia and other areas.\n\nThe majority of the suspected traffickers came from Afghanistan and Iraq and smuggled migrants into Bulgaria from Turkey.\n\nIn 2015 around one million migrants and refugees took the Western Balkans route through Serbia until Hungary closed its borders.\n\nIt have previously been claimed smugglers are assisted by corrupt Bulgarian police who get a cut of the proceeds.\n\nIn 2018 Bulgarian authorities arrested 689 migrants trying to enter the country illegally.\n\nDespite the mass influx, refugee camps in the country are said to be \u201calmost empty\u201d.\n\nBulgaria has built a security fence along its frontier with Turkey to keep out refugees and migrants.\n\nEarlier this month the country joined Greece and Cyprus in warning of a dramatic increase in arrivals from neighbouring Turkey.\n\nThey said numbers could sky-rocket because of Turkey\u2019s military operations against Kurdish fighters.\n\nIn 2017 UK authorities launched the multimillion-pound Project Invigor to tackle high-risk people smuggling.\n\n(Image: Google Maps)\n\nIt has been trying to gather intelligence in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa to disrupt gangs.\n\nLast year the National Crime Agency warned smugglers were \u201cabusing\u201d the Ireland-UK border.\n\nOfficials said they were concerned about an increase in the number of gangs found to be working through the common travel area.\n\nPassports are not currently required for British and Irish citizens travelling between the two countries.\n\nAlthough air and sea carriers say they require some form of identification, documents are not always checked.\n\nGeorgian and Vietnamese gangs have previously been caught smuggling migrants into the UK via Ireland.\n\nRichard Burnett, boss of the Road Haulage Association, said conditions inside the trailer would have been \u201cabsolutely horrendous\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis tragedy highlights the danger of migrant gangs people-smuggling on lorries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely that if this vehicle has come from Europe that it\u2019s been physically checked.\u201d\n\nHe said temperatures inside refrigerated trailer units can be as low as -25C - leading to death \u201cpretty quickly\u201d.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be dark. If the fridge is running it\u2019s going to be incredibly cold,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe only place to go to the toilet is the back of the trailer. If they\u2019ve been in there for days then there will be faeces and urine.\u201d\n\nMr Burnett said smuggling gangs are a \u201cmassive issue\u201d for UK lorry drivers, who have been attacked in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cDrivers are facing challenges from smugglers and from gangs continuously,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey have to be very careful about where they park up and about checking seals on their trailers to make sure nobody has broken in.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll cut holes through roofs, they\u2019ll pull doors back, they\u2019ll unbolt the doors and then re-bolt the doors.\u201d\n\nSteve Valdez-Symonds, of Amnesty International UK, described it as a \u201cheartbreaking and horrifying incident\u201d.\n\nAid agency Care 4 Calais said it was \u201chorrified but not surprised\u201d at the deaths of the migrants.\n\nFounder Clare Moseley blamed \u201cthe lack of safe and legal routes for people to apply for asylum\u201d.\n\n(Image: JIM BENNETT)\n\nShe added: \u201cIt means every day people who are simply seeking safety undertake dangerous journeys.\n\n\u201cIn order to claim asylum in the UK you must physically be here unless you come via a resettlement programme.\n\n\u201cIt has become impossible for people to come to the UK in a safe way. That\u2019s why people take dangerous journeys to come here.\n\n\u201cThe sole focus on security and deterrence as a means of tackling a serious humanitarian crisis is clearly failing.\n\n\u201cSmugglers and traffickers will keep exploiting these vulnerable people and avoidable deaths will continue.\u201d", "description": "Workers at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex, where 39 bodies were found in a refrigerated trailer in a suspected 'mass murder' said there had been previous issues there", "authors": ["Martin Fricker", "Emily Retter", "Amy Coles", "Image", "Pa", "Philippe Huguen Afp Getty Images", "Wikimedia Commons Marc Ryckaert", "Google Maps", "Jim Bennett"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706551.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Bodies-found-in-lorry-container.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
