Alexis has proven to be a romantic, knight-in-shining-armour, from jetting his tennis guru wife to Italy for a snack, to taking 16 weeks paternity leave to be with Serena and their daughter, Olympia.\n\nAlexis has proven his undying love for his wife in the big and little things of life. He recently again set husband goals, when he sat on a chair and posed as Serena\u2019s wig stand while she cleaned and brushed her wigs.\n\nSerena posted a series of videos on her IG stories, showing her followers how she takes care of her wigs. In the video reposted by a fan on Twitter, Serena had just washed her wigs and was brushing them \u2013 while they sit on her husband\u2019s head!\n\nShe also jokes about how her wig stand can\u2019t really keep still.", "description": "More relationship goals served up by Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9418/8440c70fff08469ebda0f814b7b2e520.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
