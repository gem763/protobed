On Sept. 26, the New York Times reported that he was a CIA officer. On Oct. 4, the newspaper added that he \"was detailed to the National Security Council at one point.\"\n\nMichael Atkinson, the Intelligence Community's inspector general, told members of Congress that the whistleblower had a \"professional tie\" to a 2020 Democratic candidate. He had written earlier that while the whistleblower's complaint was credible, he had shown \"some indicia of an arguable political bias ... in favor of a rival political candidate.\"\n\nA retired CIA officer told the Washington Examiner, \u201cFrom everything we know about the whistleblower and his work in the executive branch then, there is absolutely no doubt he would have been working with Biden when he was vice president.\"\n\nAs an experienced CIA official on the NSC with the deep knowledge of Ukraine that he demonstrated in his complaint, it is probable that the whistleblower briefed Biden and likely that he accompanied him on Air Force Two during at least one of the six visits the 2020 candidate made to the country.\n\nA former Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said Biden\u2019s work on foreign affairs brought him into close proximity with the whistleblower either at the CIA or when he was detailed to the White House.\n\n\u201cThis person, after working with Biden, may feel defensive towards him because he feels [Biden] is being falsely attacked. Maybe he is even talking to Biden\u2019s staff,\u201d the former official said. \u201cMaybe it is innocent, maybe not.\u201d\n\nLast month, the whistleblower accused President Trump of abusing his position by asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. His complaint is now at the center of a Democrat-led impeachment inquiry, prompting Trump and his allies to cry foul.\n\nBiden was President Barack Obama\u2019s \"point man\" on Ukraine, making a half dozen trips there in his eight years as vice president. Those trips involved briefings from senior intelligence officials and NSC officers, some of whom traveled with him to Kyiv and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS,\u201d tweeted Trump, after the \"professional\" link was revealed by the Washington Examiner. \u201cWhy does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?\u201d\n\nThe Whistleblower\u2019s facts have been so incorrect about my \u201cno pressure\u201d conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly. This is no Whistleblower..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nTrump said Thursday he did not know the identity of the whistleblower.\n\nThe connection to Biden has emerged a week after Atkinson, the Intelligence Community's inspector general, briefed the House Intelligence Committee on the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nAfter the report on what Atkinson said, lawyers for the whistleblower immediately insisted their client was not motivated by political considerations, but their cryptic comment fueled speculation about his identity. The careful statement did not rule out that the whistleblower worked with one of the candidates before they started running for president.\n\n\"First, our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party,\" said Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid. \"Second, our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch.\"\n\n4/Third, in these positions our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials\u2014not as candidates. \u2014 Mark S. Zaid (@MarkSZaidEsq) October 9, 2019\n\nGlenn Carle, a former CIA officer who himself blew the whistle on George W. Bush administration efforts to collect intelligence on an American citizen, said the distinction was crucial. \u201cThe truth is that the whistleblower would have worked with Biden not in some partisan political sense but as a member of the government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is scurrilous to suppose there was a political motivation.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was possible that the CIA officer briefed senators or representatives who were now running for president.", "description": "The 2020 Democratic candidate with whom the CIA whistleblower had a \"professional\" tie is Joe Biden, according to intelligence officers and former White House officials.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/181550b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2790x1465+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fbf%2Fa8%2Fcf6f05614081a7d57d9efbe0839c%2Fedited-joe-biden-and-trump-092219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
