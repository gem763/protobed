MORE said Wednesday that Turkey\u2019s offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria has \u201chas nothing to do with us,\u201d defending his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the region amid criticism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our land,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey goes into Syria that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria,\" he added. \"That\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like you to believe.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated his plan to withdraw the United States from \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way, as they shouldn\u2019t be, as two countries fight over land,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cThat has nothing to do with us.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump also downplayed the U.S. alliance with the Kurds, calling them \u201cno angels\u201d and saying the U.S. \u201cpaid a lot of money\u201d for the Syrian Kurdish forces to fight alongside U.S. troops against ISIS.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks came as a U.S. delegation led by Vice President Pence prepared to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Ankara in an attempt to broker a cease-fire in the region.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight, and as I said, they\u2019re not angels. They\u2019re not angels. You take a look \u2026 but they fought with us. We paid a lot of money for them to fight with us, and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office.\n\n\"If Russia wants to get involved with Syria, that\u2019s really up to them. They have a problem with Turkey. They have a problem at a border. It\u2019s not our border, we shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president again described the Kurds as \u201cno angels\u201d during a later press conference and asserted that the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is likely \u201cmore of a terrorist threat\u201d than ISIS \u2013 a remark that prompted criticism.\n\nTrump has faced tremendous blowback over his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria as Turkey prepared to launch a military operation at the border, including harsh criticism from some of his Republican allies.\n\nHis remarks Wednesday drew immediate and fierce criticism from Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamTrump-GOP tensions over Syria show signs of easing Trump invites congressional leaders to meeting on Turkey Graham opens door to calling Hunter Biden to testify MORE (R-S.C.), one of his closest Capitol Hill allies.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq,\u201d Graham tweeted.\n\n\u201cI fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making and I hope President Trump will adjust his thinking,\u201d Graham continued.\n\nGraham also wrote that Trump\u2019s remarks \u201ccompletely undercut\u201d Pence\u2019s and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump isolated amid Syria furor | Pompeo, Pence to visit Turkey in push for ceasefire | Turkish troops advance in Syria | Graham throws support behind Trump's sanctions Graham: Erdo\u011fan pledged to Trump to stay away from Kurdish territory in Syria Trump honors Stanley Cup champions, talks impeachment, Turkey MORE\u2019s ability to stem the conflict.\n\nMany critics have argued that Trump\u2019s move effectively greenlighted Ankara's operation and that the president abandoned Kurdish forces, a key U.S. ally in the fight against ISIS. The Kurdish militia in Syria known as the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) aligned with coalition forces to fight ISIS in the region. Turkey has long viewed the Syrian Kurds as an extension of the PKK and therefore a terrorist group.\n\nTrump's decision has also raised concerns about the potential for large numbers of ISIS fighters detained in the region to be released, undoing much of the work by U.S. and other forces to contain the terror group.\n\nAdministration officials have rejected the notion that Trump\u2019s decision to pull back troops paved the way for the Turkish operation.\n\nTrump has continued to defend his decision, saying he wants to get the U.S. out of \u201cendless wars.\u201d On Monday, he also announced sanctions on Turkey.\n\nTrump also asserted Wednesday that the situation on the Turkish border with Syria was \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d for the United States, pointing to the fact that the Kurds had struck a deal with Syrian President Bashar Assad for protection.\n\n\"So I view the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be, for the United States, strategically brilliant. Our soldiers are out of there. Our soldiers are totally safe. They\u2019ve got to work it out \u2026 Syria\u2019s protecting the Kurds, that\u2019s good. And by the way, every player hates ISIS,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe at one point suggested that some ISIS fighters in the region had been released for \u201ceffect\u201d to force the U.S. to return to the region.\n\nPence is traveling with Pompeo and Trump\u2019s new national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, to Ankara to meet with Erdo\u011fan on Thursday in an attempt to broker a cease-fire in the region. The visit comes after Trump held a phone call with Erdo\u011fan earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching and we\u2019re negotiating and we\u2019re trying to get Turkey to do the right thing,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Erdo\u011fan rejected the call for a cease-fire before Thursday\u2019s meeting.\n\nTensions between Trump and Republicans had shown signs of easing following the announcement of sanctions and the cease-fire efforts. Graham has supported Trump\u2019s efforts on sanctions and a potential cease-fire.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report misstated the president's comments.\n\n\u2014 Updated at 1:19 p.m.", "description": "President Trump said Wednesday that Turkey\u2019s offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northern Syria has \u201chas nothing to do with us,\u201d defending his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the region amid criticism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trump2_101619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
