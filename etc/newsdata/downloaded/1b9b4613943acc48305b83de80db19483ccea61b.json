Turkey has troops on the ground in Idlib, which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, backed by Russia, is pounding by air.\n\nCan, the SDF advisor, said Turkey's incursion this month -- made possible by Trump's controversial decision to withdraw some 1,000 US troops -- caused a delay in the operation against al-Baghdadi.\n\nA US State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said only that the United States, mindful of the \"chaotic situation,\" decided \"it was important that we do it now.\"\n\nTrump, touting his role in the operation, said US forces informed Russia that they were entering, telling them: \"We think you're going to be very happy.\"\n\nRussia, without confirming al-Baghdadi's death or Trump's colorful account, said it did witness US planes and drones in the area of the operation.\n\nOne country that was not informed was Syria, with the State Department official saying the United States saw no need to contact Assad's regime.\n\n- Cornered in tunnel -\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States coordinated with other militaries through established channels to avoid incidents.\n\nUS forces entered the compound by helicopter, quickly neutralized al-Baghdadi's forces in a gun fight and then secured the building to protect civilians.\n\nAl-Baghdadi ran into a tunnel and, aware that he was cornered, detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three children with him, Milley said.\n\nUS forces fired missiles, bombs and guns to blow up the compound as they left and disposed of Baghdadi's mangled body at sea, officials said.\n\nTrump said al-Baghdadi --- whose group has slaughtered and enslaved thousands of civilians -- was \"whimpering, screaming and crying\" as he faced certain death.\n\nMilley did not confirm the detail but said Trump may have heard the account directly from unit members, none of whom were hurt.\n\nTrump described al-Baghdadi as a \"coward\" and a \"loser\" and said he \"died like a dog.\"\n\nAs far as real dogs, one member of the US \"K-9 unit\" that chased al-Baghdadi was wounded but not killed. Milley hailed the dog for its \"tremendous service.\"", "description": "The operation to kill the Islamic State group's leader took months of intelligence work, required the snatching of his underwear and ended when one of the world's most sought-after men blew himself up.
