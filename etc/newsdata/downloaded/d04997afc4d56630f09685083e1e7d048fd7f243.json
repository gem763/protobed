Over the last three decades the building on Balfour Place has provided multi-let apartments and office premises.\n\nJacopo Marzocco, the founding director of developers Redd, looks out of the street after purchasing the sprawling building\n\nMayfair is the exclusive London district between Hyde Park, Green Park, Oxford Street and Regent Street\n\nA picture of the Kulukundis and the Mavroleons Greek shipping families, who used to own the building\n\nThe building has now been acquired with a view to transforming it into a luxury mixed-use development.\n\nRedd managing director Russell Smithers said: 'Redd has just acquired the freehold of a magnificent historic mansion building on Balfour Place in Mayfair which was once the headquarters for the legendry Kulukundis and Mavroleon shipping dynasty.\n\n'We plan to consult closely with Grosvenor and the City of Westminster and transform this into Redd's first multi-unit boutique residential scheme in London. We are also in the process of seeking further prime projects in London, working on behalf of private investors and clients.'", "description": "The mansion in Balfour Place - near Hyde Park - was once the base of London & Overseas Shipping Line, owned by the Kulukundis and the Mavroleons families.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/09/19385770-0-image-a-21_1570436914228.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
