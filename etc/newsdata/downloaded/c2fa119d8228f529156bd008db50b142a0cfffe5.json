We are still here resisting the cuts that hurt Ontario communities,\u201d said Ontario Federation of Labour President Chris Buckley.\n\n\u201cWe are sending a message to Ford: we\u2019re not going away. We have the Power of Many on our side and we\u2019re demanding better from this government. We won\u2019t rest until every person in Ontario has decent work, strong communities and access to the well-funded publicly delivered services they rely on,\u201d said Buckley.\n\nThree-quarters of Ontarians do not support the Conservative government. Conservative cuts and changes continue to cause hardship for Ontario workers.\n\nReduced funding to schools has meant layoffs for education workers, meaning, among other things, 50,000 fewer courses for students. Cuts to post-secondary funding have forced some students to drop out of universities and colleges. Cuts to public health hurt Ontarians, and under the Conservative government\u2019s changes to health care, more people are forced to endure hallway medicine. On October 16, the Premier refused to take action to improve health and safety for temp agency workers, opting instead to arrest eight peaceful protestors who were demanding he enact an already-passed piece of legislation.\n\nThe Conservatives have proposed to limit compensation increases for public sector workers in every sector including: health care, long term care, all levels of education, social services, municipal services and more. While proposing a limit at a rate far below the annual rate of inflation, the government has given its Deputy Ministers a 14 per cent raise.\n\nMonday, October 28, workers and communities are coming together to demand that the government fully fund public services like health care, education and child care, act to improve health and safety in all workplaces and for all workers in the province. Stop cancelling services for Ontario\u2019s most vulnerable, respect collective bargaining rights, and start to take meaningful action on the climate emergency.\n\nActions on October 28 will include:\n\nAudiovisual opportunity \u2013 7:30 a.m. to 11:45 a.m.:\n\nPlace: Queen\u2019s Park circle Event: A cavalcade of floats will circle Queen\u2019s Park carrying messages demanding an Ontario for all.\n\nPress Conference \u2013 10:00 a.m.\n\nPlace: Queen\u2019s Park media studio Speakers: Ontario Federation of Labour President Chris Buckley will speak. A post-press conference scrum will be held where media can speak with Ontario\u2019s labour leaders, students, and workers who have been laid off despite Ford\u2019s promises that \u201cnot one job\u201d would be lost.\n\nThe OFL Power of Many is a campaign by the Ontario Federation of Labour and its allies in communities across Ontario, working together to protect and win decent work laws, strong public services, along with equality and justice, as well as safe and healthy communities for all.\n\nThe Ontario Federation of Labour represents 54 unions and one million workers in Ontario.
