Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) lacked legal grounds to bring the case alleging that the president violates the Constitution when his business accepts payments from state and foreign governments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat decision, from three judges nominated by Republican presidents, also put a halt to dozens of subpoenas to federal agencies and Trump\u2019s private business entities.\n\nIn a statement after the court\u2019s order Tuesday, Frosh said \u201cevery single day, President Trump is receiving payments from foreign governments and from the United States. We intend to hold him accountable for violations of our nation\u2019s original anti-corruption laws.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of three major cases testing for the first time the Constitution\u2019s ban on the country\u2019s leaders engaging in private business relationships with foreign governments.\n\nAD\n\nIn a New York case, brought by Trump\u2019s business competitors, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in September said a lower-court judge had improperly thrown out the case in late 2017.\n\nAD\n\nA separate case in Washington, filed by congressional Democrats, is on hold while Trump appeals.\n\nThe president has stepped back from day-to-day management of the Trump International Hotel and his other businesses, but he maintains ownership.\n\nIn the 4th Circuit case, the plaintiffs argued that payments Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel receives when foreign governments book large blocks of rooms and meeting space are violations of the foreign emoluments clause. The Justice Department called them market-rate deals that should not be considered emoluments.\n\nAD\n\nThe initial three-judge panel found the attorneys general did not have standing to bring their case against the president in part because they had failed to show that Trump\u2019s conduct harmed the financial interests of Maryland and the District.\n\n\u201cThere is a distinct possibility \u2014 which was completely ignored by the District and Maryland, as well as by the district court \u2014 that certain government officials might avoid patronizing the Hotel because of the President\u2019s association with it,\u201d wrote Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, who was joined by judges Dennis W. Shedd and A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr.\n\nAD", "description": "The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed to rehear the lawsuit in December over whether the president is illegally profiting from foreign and state government visitors.", "authors": ["Ann E.
