Detectives on the case said they are looking for the other two suspects in the murder who are still at large.\n\nThe head of Special Crimes Prevention Unit, Pius Gitari, said they are following important leads regarding the whereabouts of the missing suspects.\n\nPolice are still unclear regarding the motive of the killing. They exhumed the body Wednesday from the banks of the river and are examining it with the aid of a team of experts.\n\nFather Kyengo was last seen driving his car on October 7, the day he was abducted. When the priest did not return to his Thatha parish, fellow priests reported him missing to the police.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "A Catholic priest in Kenya has been found dead with his throat slit and his body \u201ccut\u201d and buried in a shallow grave. |", "authors": ["Thomas D.
