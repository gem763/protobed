Desperate, Mercedes goes to old flame Liam Donovan (Jude Monk McGowan) in the hopes that he will be able to help her out of this predicament. The question is: how far will Liam go in order to keep his and Mercedes\u2019 secret hidden?\n\nEarlier this year, Liam tried to cheer up a sullen Mercedes, so the pair stole Harry\u2019s (Parry Glasspool) new vehicle and went out for a joyride. However, during said joyride, an argument broke out, and the lovers ended up knocking down Grace (Tamara Wall).\n\nAfterwards, Harry became prime suspect in the police investigation into the incident and Grace held him personally responsible. Harry discovered the truth and managed to record Mercedes\u2019 threatening confession, but Breda McQueen (Moya Brady) viciously murdered him before he could inform everyone of the truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, in the coming episodes, Joel discovers Harry\u2019s phone \u2014 and stumbles upon the recording of Mercedes confessing to the hit-and-run. Afterwards, he heads to The Dog to play it aloud for Mercedes, before informing her that he\u2019ll give her one chance to tell her family before he goes to the police.\n\nUnable to think of a solution, Mercedes turns to the one person who\u2019s always been there to help her out of tricky situations in the past. After tracking Liam down, she informs him of what\u2019s happened and, as per usual, Liam promises to help her. However, he wants something in return.\n\nHe tries to break in to the McQueens household whilst Joel and Goldie (Chelsee Healey) are asleep. Later, he tries to bribe Joel in to giving him the phone back.\n\nOn Liam\u2019s actions, actor Jude Monk McGowan said: \u2018Predictably, he tries to buy Joel off. He tries to use the fairest means possible to get Joel to keep the information to himself. When this inevitably fails, he has to use a bit more forceful and violent means in doing it.\u2019\n\nLiam\u2019s proven just how relentless he can be when it comes to those he cares about, so he\u2019ll no doubt pull out all the stops to protect the woman he loves.\n\nThe question is: just how violent will his actions get?\n\nCould Liam perhaps kill Joel so that his and Mercy\u2019s secret remains hidden forever? With a big stunt week coming up, it\u2019s certainly a possibility.\n\nHollyoaks continues Friday 10th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Liam will stop at nothing to keep his and Mercedes' secret hidden.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5278-Liam-and-Joel-0b38_1570727004.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
