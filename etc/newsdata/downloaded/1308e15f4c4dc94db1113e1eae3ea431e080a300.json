Announcing the new functionality in a blog post, Luna Display says that the feature works between any combination of iMacs, Mac minis, and MacBooks running on macOS 10.8 Mountain Lion or later.\n\nIn a tweet, Luna Display CEO Matt Ronge said that the functionality was a direct response to being \u201csherlocked\u201d by Apple\u2019s new Sidecar feature, which builds much of Luna Display\u2019s functionality natively into macOS Catalina. Apple\u2019s first-party solution only lets you use iPad tablets as a secondary display.\n\nThe new functionality should help you find a use for any old Mac lying around, which you might have been tempted to sell or recycle. Over on Daring Fireball John Gruber notes that the feature will be especially helpful for anyone who owns an older 5K iMac, who now has the option of pairing that computer\u2019s excellent display with some more modern hardware.\n\nLuna Display isn\u2019t the only company that\u2019s being challenged by Catalina\u2019s Sidecar. Duet offered a similar Mac to iPad screen sharing app (without that silly dongle), and has responded by beefing up its support for non-Apple hardware. It already worked with Windows PCs, and earlier this month it added support for Android devices.\n\nIn order to use Luna Display\u2019s new Mac-to-Mac functionality you\u2019ll need two Macs (obviously), and one of Luna\u2019s $69.99 USB-C or Mini DisplayPort dongles. Your host machine will need to be running macOS 10.11 or later, while the secondary Mac will need to be running macOS 10.8 or up. You can find a full list of instructions on how to get the functionality to work on Luna Display\u2019s site.", "description": "Luna Display, the software that previously let you use your iPad as a second display for your Mac, now lets you use a Mac itself as a secondary display.
