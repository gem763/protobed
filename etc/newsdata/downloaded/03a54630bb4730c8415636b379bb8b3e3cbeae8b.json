REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s role in the company, Burisma Holdings Limited, is in focus after the White House published a memo showing U.S. President Donald Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July phone call to get prosecutors to look into his activities. Zelenskiy agreed.\n\nJoe Biden, former U.S. vice president and a contender in next year\u2019s U.S. presidential race, has denied using his influence to get Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general fired to prevent him investigating his son\u2019s involvement and has said that he and his son have done nothing wrong.\n\nUkraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau said on Friday it was investigating activity at Burisma between 2010-2012, but that it was not looking into changes to its board in 2014 when Hunter Biden joined.\n\nHunter Biden was a director on Burisma\u2019s board from 2014 until at least 2018, according to documents filed by the company in Cyprus where it is registered.\n\nAzarov, who was prime minister from 2010-2014, is himself wanted by Ukrainian authorities for alleged abuse of power.\n\nHe said he was not aware of any evidence suggesting wrongdoing on Hunter Biden\u2019s part, but said it was in the Ukrainian public interest to ascertain the legality of his activities.\n\nIn particular, he said it was important to investigate what Biden had done for Burisma to justify his fee.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s essential,\u201d Azarov told Reuters in Moscow where he fled after street protests toppled Russia-friendly President Viktor Yanukovich in 2014.\n\n\u201cGiven that this question has been raised there is a real reason for this to be looked into. It\u2019s a fact (his directorship and fees) and not made up. It should be investigated so that the \u201ci\u201d s can be dotted and the \u201ct\u201d s crossed.\u201d\n\nAzarov said the key thing for investigators to establish from a Ukrainian legal viewpoint would be whether Biden\u2019s fee was a token one or whether he actually did any work to justify it.\n\n\u201cIf, using his knowledge, he played an active role then there\u2019s nothing scandalous about it. But if he was simply on the books and getting money then that could be seen as a violation of the law.\u201d\n\nThough he said he was deeply sceptical of the allegations, Azarov said he also thought it was right that the circumstances of the general prosecutor\u2019s sacking in 2016 be looked into.\n\nIn a separate interview in Kiev, Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine\u2019s ex-foreign minister, told Reuters he and others were surprised by the White House\u2019s decision to release confidential details of Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nAccording to Ukrainian law, such calls are strictly confidential and Zelenskiy could not be compelled to release the Ukrainian transcript or a summary memo, said Klimkin.\n\nKlimkin listened in when former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko held phone calls with Trump, but said he had never heard Trump raise Biden in those conversations or try to extract a personal favour in return for U.S. military aid.\n\n\u201cThe style and the way in which Trump communicates was probably similar but the content was different. That\u2019s all I can say without releasing details,\u201d said Klimkin.", "description": "Ukraine must investigate the activities of Joe Biden's son to establish whether his role in a Ukrainian gas company complied with the country's laws, Mykola Azarov, Ukraine's former prime minister, said in an interview.", "authors": ["Anton Zverev", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434584393&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q19X", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
