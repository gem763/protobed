Channel 10 has denied giving Lindsay Lohan a cheat sheet to help her with identifying local celebrities on The Masked Singer Australia\n\nBut Channel 10 has flatly denied giving the cheat sheet to the Mean Girls star, insisting that it is simply a list of all the names guessed so far that is supplied to all the judges, according to TV Tonight.\n\nThe curious reveal comes as the show faces criticism for the notability of celebrities such as Wendell Sailor and Nikki Webster, who wouldn't be familiar to those from the US.\n\nMcKnight, who is the editor of industry website TV Blackbox, told Daily Mail Australia that the format of the show is brilliantly fun, but the program is let down by the celebrity talent.\n\nWho? It comes as the show faces criticism for the notability of celebrities such as Wendell Sailor (pictured) and Nikki Webster, who wouldn't be familiar to those from the US.\n\n'The recent ratings show that viewers are still interested to see who is behind the mask, but I believe the calibre of celebrities has let the show down,' McKnight said.\n\n'In week one we were all shocked at Gretel Killeen, but since then it's all been a bit ho hum.'\n\nMcKnight said that Channel 10 needs to invest more money in casting next season, and possibly even bring in a major international star.\n\n'Serious questions need to be asked about making sure the show continues to perform next year,' he said.\n\nAccording to TV expert Rob McKnight, the format of The Masked Singer is brilliantly fun, but the program is let down by the celebrity talent. Pictured: Gretel Killeen and Osher G\u00fcnsberg\n\n'Considering that the show has a following, it will be important for Channel 10 to invest money on bigger celebrities.'\n\nMcKnight added that this season's celebrity reveals have also been lacking in energy because 'everyone [at home] has guessed who they are.'\n\nPerhaps the solution to this is incorporating less obvious and more cryptic clues, like in the popular US version of the show.\n\nMcKnight concluded: 'Make no mistake, The Masked Singer is the best show of the year, the key will be making it even bigger and better for next year.'", "description": "Channel 10 have denied giving Lindsay Lohan a cheat sheet to help her  identify local celebrities on The Masked Singer Australia.", "authors": ["Tom Place For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/06/19772418-0-image-a-12_1571203837065.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
