This liquid-heavy rendering \u2014 one of the wordless adaptations of literary classics that are Synetic\u2019s trademark \u2014 faithfully relays Shakespeare\u2019s story, about an exiled duke raising his daughter, Miranda (Maryam Najafzada), on an island inhabited by the spirit Ariel (Alex Mills) and the flesh-bound Caliban (Vato Tsikurishvili). But the familiar story acquires an often-dazzling distinctiveness from the watery mise-en-scene and the direction of Synetic\u2019s founding artistic director, Paata Tsikurishvili.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCaliban\u2019s mother, Sycorax (Anne Flowers), engages Prospera in drenching combat and winds up a floating corpse. The soulfulness and vulnerability of Caliban radiate all the more clearly \u2014 especially in a marvelous image at the end of the show \u2014 because his amphibian traits set him apart from his acquaintances. In the production\u2019s most thrilling effect, Ariel plays a magic piano whose keys are water spouts.\n\nAt the same time, though, the onstage lagoon is an overpowering, high-drama presence that \u2014 in conjunction with Andrew Griffin\u2019s mostly steel-colored lighting \u2014 keeps the production from ranging as widely as it should in tone and mood. Admittedly, the scene in which Miranda and the princely shipwreck victim, Ferdinand (Scott Brown), fall in love \u2014 while scrubbing the piano \u2014 is charming; the sequence gets a lift from its pop-tune-meets-Pachelbel\u2019s-Canon underscoring, one of the few upbeat moments in composer/sound designer Konstantine Lortkipanidze\u2019s ominous score.\n\nMore often, though, the atmosphere of sodden foreboding dampens the lighter business. Mills\u2019s mischievous, silvery Ariel does get some pranks in: A trick on the servant Stephano (Joshua Cole Lucas at this performance, usually Matt R. Stover) involves a pink bikini bottom and (invisible) fish. Still, such antics ultimately get diluted in the waterlogged gloominess.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe water is so conspicuous that it often distracts from the show\u2019s spell. You find yourself wondering: Are the performers uncomfortable in their clammy costumes? What fantastic brand of no-streak mascara are they using? And is Prospera in a bad mood because her sodden feet have gone all prune-y?\n\nThe Tempest, directed by Paata Tsikurishvili; choreographer, Irina Tsikurishvili; properties master, Kelli L. Jones.
