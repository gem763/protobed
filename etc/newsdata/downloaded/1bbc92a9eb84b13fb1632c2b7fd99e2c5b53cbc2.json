The Kurds are very well protected. Plus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they\u2019re no angels.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, he said: \u201cOur soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way, as they shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nHe answered reporters\u2019 questions as he met at the White House with Italian president Sergio Mattarella.\n\nTurkey launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters allied with the United States after Mr Trump pulled troops from the region earlier this month.\n\nHis decision was strongly condemned in the US \u2014 including by usual Republican allies in Congress \u2014 and around the world as contributing to regional instability and the abandonment of an ally.\n\nHe noted that Syria was getting \u201csome help with Russia and that\u2019s fine\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf Russia wants to get involved with Syria, that\u2019s really up to them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our border. We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\u201d\n\nMr Trump imposed new sanctions on Turkey this week in an attempt to force President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to end his assault.\n\nMr Trump is also sending a delegation led by vice president Mike Pence to Turkey to meet with Mr Erdogan in an attempt to help negotiate a cease-fire.\n\nMr Trump said the US should not be involved in \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East and \u201cit\u2019s time for us to come home\u201d.\n\nThe president said that if Syria wants to fight over land that does not belong to the US, \u201cthat\u2019s up to them and Turkey\u201d.\n\nEven as Mr Trump defended his removal of US troops from north-eastern Syria, he praised his decision to send more troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom defend against Iran.\n\nTrump said the US is sending missiles and \u201cgreat power\u201d to the Saudis, and \u201cthey\u2019re paying for that\u201d.", "description": "The US president sought to downplay the crisis that followed his decision to pull out of Syria.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/wire-19805628-1571257134-660_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
