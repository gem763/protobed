Financial institutions need funding to balance out these temporary imbalances.\n\n\u201cYou get an overnight loan, then your clients go on trading the next day,\u201d Tobik said.\n\nNursing The Market\n\nDuring the financial crisis of 2008, the overnight lending market froze up completely, and the Federal Reserve was forced to step in and \u201cnurse it along\u201d for roughly a decade, Tobik said.\n\nSince the crisis, banks have been forced to keep large amounts of excess capital reserves on their balance sheets.\n\nThese banks can make a little bit of extra cash on these reserves by lending them out overnight at a rate around 2%.\n\nThe borrowers must post some form of collateral for those loans.\n\nLast week, the median rate on those overnight loans jumped to 5% \u2014 and Tobik isn\u2019t buying the Fed\u2019s explanation.\n\n\u201cThe narrative we hear was it was just an imbalance thing due to taxes. It was a one-time thing,\u201d Tobik said.\n\nCollateral In Question\n\nInstead, given the ongoing operations by the Fed, Tobik said the issue is likely with what\u2019s being posted as collateral.\n\n\u201cThat tax imbalance thing, seeing as how the Fed has stepped in and said we\u2019re going to keep doing this for the next month, that\u2019s definitely not true,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fact that the Fed is now selling 14-day repos is a red flag.\n\n\u201cInstead of just an overnight where we\u2019re posting collateral for just one night on something, there\u2019s apparently assets out there that no one wants to lend on for 14 days ... I don\u2019t know what\u2019s being posted, but there are banks looking at this stuff and saying, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to get my money back in two weeks. It\u2019s a cause for concern,\u201d Tobik said.\n\nIPOs To Blame?\n\nUnfortunately, Tobik said the average retail investor doesn\u2019t have the visibility to see exactly what\u2019s going on with these overnight positions and whether they pose a threat to the entire market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the subprime mortgages, but there\u2019s something equally as toxic that no one wants to put a finger on,\u201d he said.\n\nTobik said one possible contributor is extremely volatile and unpredictable recent IPOs, such as Beyond Meat Inc (NASDAQ: BYND), Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY) and Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU).\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of junk being pushed into the market, and the brokers backing these things don\u2019t seem to have a ton of confidence,\u201d Tobik said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pushing leaky boats into the ocean and hoping it floats far enough away that nobody sees who pushed it in.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Tobik said earnings expectations are so high today that even small EPS and guidance misses can trigger huge overnight swings in share price.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing this repo trade, I don\u2019t know if I want to be holding this thing through earnings, because what if they miss by a couple of cents? That collateral is now worth a lot less, and it all trickles through,\u201d he said.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nTobik isn\u2019t the only skeptic of the tidal wave of recent IPOs. Buying shares of the newest stock to hit the market can be exciting, but large tech IPOs traditionally have poor returns in their first year of trading.\n\nBut even investors that are not buying IPOs should keep an eye on the overnight lending market until more is known about what is causing these liquidity issues.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
