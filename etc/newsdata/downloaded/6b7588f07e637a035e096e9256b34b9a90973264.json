But you can\u2019t ignore it.\u201d\n\nThe multi-year extension with AT&T; Sports will begin in 2021 and increase the team\u2019s revenues. Terms have not been announced, but Monfort said signing a free agent to a lucrative deal this offseason is unlikely.\n\nThe Rockies payroll this season was a record $156.6 million.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a lot of flexibility next year of making some great big splash,\u201d Monfort said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t get creative and do some things that will help if the right deal comes along.\u201d\n\nMurphy signed a two-year, $24 million contract last winter and is owed $14 million. He broke his left index finger diving for a ground ball in the second game of the season and missed 20 games. He hit .279 with 35 doubles, 13 homers and 78 RBIs in 132 games and did not play well at first base.\n\n\u201cI thought Daniel\u2019s year all the way around was just OK,\u201d Bridich said.\n\nThe Rockies expect Murphy to make a concerted effort to get in better shape before spring training.\n\n\u201cDid he play on a scouting scale an average first base? Probably not,\u201d Black said. \u201cI think another offseason with Daniel getting in work at first base and taking the steps he has told me he is going to take this winter to come back with a vengeance and play like he\u2019s capable both on offense and defense - I think we\u2019ll see a different Daniel Murphy next year.\u201d\n\nBlack, who will be entering his third season as Rockies manager in 2020, has had little turnover on his coaching staff.\n\nFirst base coach Tony Diaz left after 2018 to become third base coach for the Minnesota Twins. Hitting coach Duane Espy was fired after last season and replaced by Dave Magadan.\n\nBridich said it\u2019s yet to be determined whether there will be any staff changes.\n\n\u201cGot to let the emotion of the season die down a little bit here,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll catch up on some energy and some sleep and make some decisions in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Colorado Rockies owner Dick Monfort says nobody in the front office is worried that star Nolan Arenado will opt out of his $260 million contract in two years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/brewers_rockies_baseball_64071_c0-89-2168-1353_s1770x1032.jpg?35fda4e1257cd2b5d9eaa9ffdbeafbf290e22be1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
