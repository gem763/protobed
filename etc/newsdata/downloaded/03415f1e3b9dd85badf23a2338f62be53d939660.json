Hilb didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nBuyout firms have invested heavily in the insurance brokerage space in recent years, often with the aim of growing the portfolio company through buying smaller firms in an industry which is still largely fragmented.\n\nHilb has announced 18 such acquisitions so far in 2019, according to its website. In total, Hilb has 85 offices spread across 21 states.\n\nInsurance brokerages also produce consistent cash flows, which private equity firms like, although stagnating premium growth among insurers, which feeds through into commission payments to brokers, is a challenge facing the sector.\n\n(This story corrects valuation reference to including, not excluding, debt.)", "description": "Private equity house Abry Partners is working with an investment bank to sell its majority stake in Hilb Group, in a deal that is expected to value the insurance broker at more than $1 billion including debt, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Greg Roumeliotis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
