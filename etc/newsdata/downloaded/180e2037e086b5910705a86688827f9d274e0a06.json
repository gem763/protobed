We try to show at least 3 ways to wear any 1 garment, allowing versatility for all occasions.'\n\nJaspre Leopard Skirt, now $58; neverfullydressed.co.uk\n\nBlack Pablo Floral Jaspre Skirt, $477; neverfullydressed.co.uk\n\nNFD was founded before the launch of Instagram, so the label has grown with the platform giving them an authentic edge in such an over saturated market.\n\n'Newer brands are all about Influencer outreach,' said Lucy. 'We have maintained our story telling which is completely customer facing, making us an approachable brand.\n\n'The DM\u2019s we receive as so personal, we build relationships with our customers through the channel.'\n\nLucy reveals that the label's top selling pieces are the 'JoJo' dress, the classic wrap dresses and their suits - all sexy in a subtle way, empowering women in their femininity.\n\nJoJo Maxi Dress, $116; neverfullydressed.co.uk\n\nAnimal Print Reversible Wrap Dress, $169; neverfullydressed.co.uk\n\nWhile many brands turn to the catwalks for inspiration, Never Fully Dressed focuses on their clientele.\n\n'Our customer is our muse, our customer is our Influencer, that is who inspires us.' Lucy revealed. Adding culture, history, travel and high fashion to the mix.\n\nThe designer also highly regards her mom as her muse for her strong work ethic and fashion repertoire continuously influencing the brand.\n\nUS fashionistas can rejoice! The brand has some exciting plans with big retailers as well as direct distribution in America, coming soon.\n\nJust in time for fall/winter, they released a leopard print coat and clash print faux fur scarves; the perfect layering pieces over skin-baring garments!", "description": "Never Fully Dressed has become a world renowned brand.
