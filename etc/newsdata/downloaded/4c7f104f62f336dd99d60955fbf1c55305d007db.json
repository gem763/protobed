We\u2019ll need a visa? Are we able to work in the U.K.?' This uncertainty for our citizens is for me the biggest nightmare.\u201d\n\nBettel was reluctant to talk about opportunities as a result of Brexit for Luxembourg, a financial hub. \u201cI was not like some other colleagues who went to London to say 'leave the country' ... because whether we want it or not London, is still our neighbor ... I was not the pushy one, saying 'leave London, come to us,' a bit like hyenas.\u201d\n\nThe Luxembourg PM said he doesn't think Brexit complications would cause problems for the handover at the European Commission, with Ursula von der Leyen officially taking over from Jean-Claude Juncker on November 1. As a result, he doesn't think Juncker and von der Leyen both need to be at the October summit of EU leaders (\u201cyou cannot have two popes in the same room\u201d).\n\nBettel also seemed puzzled about reports that Johnson is hoping to find ways to get around the new law requiring him to request a Brexit delay if there's no deal, even if that means risking going to jail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the second power, the first power is my parliament, so in my country when parliament decides, I do,\u201d Bettel said.", "description": "A no-deal Brexit is \u2018the scenario I don\u2019t want,\u2019 says Xavier Bettel.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Florian Eder", "Charlie Cooper", "Annabelle Dickson", "Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1052377404-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
