I love what I do and realize I am supremely lucky to be able to make my living by writing and speaking about the news of the day. I find contentment in the craft of writing and fulfillment in self-expression. But I do sometimes wonder what I am actually accomplishing. Much of my journalism for the past four years has been devoted to critiquing President Trump and opposing the spread of Trumpism. But no matter how many columns or sound bites I produce, he remains in office, acting (as Sharpiegate shows) more erratically than ever. Sure, he\u2019s not terribly popular \u2014 but he could still be reelected. I am left to ask if all my work has made any difference.\n\nBoot\u2019s comments sound like an article out of the Babylon Bee, but sadly, they\u2019ve come from a regular newspaper. This deluded man, who once or twice a week writes a column denigrating the President believes that his opinion is so important, it can remove a president from office.\n\nNo matter how many columns or sound bites I produce, Trump remains in office, acting (as Sharpiegate shows) more erratically than ever. I am left to ask if all my work has made any difference. Chores produce more measurable results. My column: https://t.co/gBumLjXT6V \u2014 Max Boot (@MaxBoot) September 7, 2019\n\nNeedless to say, many conservatives were quite astonished by Boot\u2019s lack of self-awareness. Conservative writer Charles C. W. Cooke started the ball rolling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve written the same column every three days for four years, and I still haven\u2019t overturned the last election!\u201d \u2014 Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) September 9, 2019\n\nMany twitter users agreed with Cooke. Here are some of the responses to his post.\n\n\u201cWait this is real? \u201cCome on. This can\u2019t be real. This is something I would write as parody.\u201d \u201cwow just like Anthony Hopkins at the end of elephant man, tearfully wondering \u201cwhat was it all for?\u2026just breaks your heart.\u201d \u201cDelusions of grandeur met by the reality that nobody cares. Hate to see it.\u201d \u201cHe remains in office because US Presidential terms are for 4 years. What\u2019s his point?\u201d \u201cThis reads like a transcript of a therapy session. \u201d \u201cI think I see the problem now. He actually believes he\u2019s persuasive. He\u2019s a modern day Don Quixote.\u201d \u201cSoft meltdown from snappy fedora guy @MaxBoot\u2026\u201dMy journalism\u201d, he says\u2026While lamenting his purposeful targeted activism has failed to make a difference.\u201d \u201cThis sounds like something taken out of his diary, not his column.\u201d \u201cThis is the funniest thing Max Boot has ever written.\u201d \u201cIf I say the say the same thing 1000x in a row, maybe it will be more effective than 999x in a row.\u201d \u201cMax Boot, who has spent the past four years of his life regurgitating the same column every few days, ponders why his work has yet to nullify the 2016 election.\u201d", "description": "Washington Post Writer Has No Idea Why, After All Of His Columns and Hard Work, Trump Is Still In Office", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Sister Toldjah", "Dan Spencer", "Brandon Morse", "Brad Slager", "Sarah Lee", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/flickr-washington-post-building.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
