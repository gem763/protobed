But in the two years since it was scrapped, a number of drill artists have been censored by police.\n\nForm 696 was a form that promoters and venues had to submit to the Metropolitan Police two weeks before an event, supplying them with information such as the names and phone numbers of DJs and artists, and most worryingly of all, the genre of music being performed, and the target ethnic group.\n\nThe form was used to racially discriminate against Black artists, with many grime, garage, and drum\u2019n\u2019bass raves in particular being shut down in the 2000s and 2010s. Police would strong arm venues into cancelling events, often at the very last minute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe form was scrapped after a review by Mayor Sadiq Khan in November 2017 \u2013 but as we can see now, that hasn\u2019t stopped the police from censoring Black music.\n\nDrill artists Skengdo x AM earlier this year received an injunction prohibiting them from performing certain songs live. More recently, rapper Rico Racks was jailed for three years for drug offences and also told by the judge that he is banned from rapping specific slang words.\n\nBanning the use of words such as \u2018trapping\u2019 (drug dealing), \u2018bandoe\u2019 (a drug house), \u2018connect\u2019 (a drugs contact) and \u2018whip\u2019 (car) is an extreme counter-measure. The injunction doesn\u2019t even specify the context in which the words can\u2019t be used. It\u2019s an outright encroachment on Rico Racks\u2019 freedom of speech.\n\nJudges have deemed that the use of these words incites violence, but really, it\u2019s about the perceived threat of Blackness, and music being a form of self-expression and liberty.\n\nBy censoring the speech of marginalised people, you remove the liberating power of telling their stories.\n\nThe pressure shouldn\u2019t have to be on young Black people having to code their language even further, particularly in live music settings, just to avoid police harassment.\n\nJust as Form 696 was used to censor grime in the past, drill music is now in the hot seat and being targeted by the authorities. Police are using similar tactics as they used to use to get grime shows and events cancelled. Skengdo x AM, who received their injunction in January, recently told TRENCH Magazine that the police had previously also contacted venues in attempts to get their shows cancelled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic led by Black youth has always been considered \u2018rebel music\u2019, as coined by dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson. In the 00s, grime presented a new challenge for the establishment: it was much darker and bass-led in tone and energy, compared to the reggae that came decades before it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the music alone that was seen as a threat \u2013 if a grime rave was held by white people in Mayfair, there likely wouldn\u2019t be an issue. It\u2019s the idea that the presence of young Black people in groups, mainly men, is seen as a threat to public safety.\n\nIn times of austerity, drill (like grime before it) has become a viable path to earning a livelihood for a lot of artists and MCs. With youth violence being considered an urgent social issue, removing one of the few outlets young Black people have to not only make a living, but also to express themselves, will only further alienate and disenfranchise them.\n\nDrill as a genre is on-the-nose and graphic, as artists express the realities of poverty they\u2019ve had to face. Shows like Top Boy depict this life, but drill gets right to the heart of it, because the stories being shared are from those who are voiceless.\n\nThe pressure shouldn\u2019t have to be on young Black people having to code their language even further, particularly in live music settings, just to avoid police harassment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther criminalisation hasn\u2019t solved crime, and using artists to set an example sets a dangerous precedent. We need to continue to fight to protect self-expression in Black art if we are to avoid history repeating itself.\n\nMORE: Stormzy\u2019s scholarships cannot come soon enough for black Cambridge students\n\nMORE: I help foster children tell their story through rap\n\nMORE: All black women want from clubs is good music and a place to be ourselves", "description": "Drill artist Rico Racks has been jailed for three years and served an injunction banning him from using specific slang words.", "authors": ["Jesse Bernard", "London-Based Freelance Journalist"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rico1-c3e6_1571928531.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
