In a nearly 6,000-word Op-Ed for The Times, Mr. Hughes argues that Mr. Zuckerberg, whom he considers a \u201cgood, kind person,\u201d simply has more influence over how businesses and people relate than any individual should. (Here are five takeaways from his piece.) \u201cMark\u2019s power,\u201d he says, \u201cis unprecedented and un-American,\u201d and must be curtailed. He writes:\n\nFacebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category.\n\nMr. Hughes contends that Facebook\u2019s dominance prohibits would-be entrepreneurs from creating alternative social networks, suffocating innovation and restricting consumer choice. The damage extends to industries beyond tech, including journalism, whose business model was broken by Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s capture of digital advertising revenue. In warning about the dangers of Facebook\u2019s monopolistic ambitions, Mr. Hughes cites Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor and the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness,\u201d who told Wired\u2019s editor, Nicholas Thompson:\n\nMark Zuckerberg wrote an email when he was acquiring Instagram that was disclosed in the New York Post, and it suggests he was buying Instagram because he saw it as a competitive threat. Now, it is a felony under U.S. law to buy companies that you believe are competitive threats to you. \u2026 The American way is that we believe in competition and that companies should fight it out, not buy each other when there\u2019s serious competition.\n\nBut the most pernicious aspect of Facebook\u2019s hegemony, Mr. Hughes says, is Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cunilateral control over speech.\u201d He points as an example to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s 2017 decision to stop Facebook Messenger from being used in Myanmar to spread calls for the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. At the same time, United Nations investigators and human rights groups said that the company didn\u2019t do nearly enough and, in its negligence, actively facilitated what has since been deemed a genocide.\n\n\u201cMark knows that this is too much power,\u201d Mr. Hughes writes.\n\nBreaking up Facebook isn\u2019t a silver bullet\n\nBreaking up Facebook isn\u2019t enough, as even Mr. Hughes admits, since it won\u2019t address some of society\u2019s greatest grievances with the platform, argues Evelyn Douek in Slate. On the issue of election security, she writes:\n\nIf we\u2019re worried about Russia or other foreign powers using Facebook and other social media platforms to influence elections \u2014 as Sen. Elizabeth Warren mentions when making her case for breakup \u2014 then we also need to acknowledge that these influence campaigns are often sophisticated, cross-platform operations that require well-resourced, expert and coordinated responses. No one has made a good case for how breakup and competition would aid these efforts.\n\nMs. Douek also agrees with Mr. Hughes that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s control over speech is deeply troubling. But she fails to see how increased competition would have helped in Myanmar, where the military purposefully spread violent propaganda. Authoritarianism and ethnic hatred are not problems the market can solve, nor are \u201cthe most intractable issues about how to moderate speech on any individual platform.\u201d\n\nUser privacy, Shira Ovide argues in Bloomberg, is another issue that breaking apart the Facebook platform from Instagram and WhatsApp wouldn\u2019t fix. She writes:\n\nDoes a core Facebook with perhaps 1 billion users have less ability to harvest information such as people\u2019s web-surfing habits and physical locations as they roam around with smartphones? No, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nBoth Ms. Douek and Ms. Ovide are open to breaking up Facebook to keep markets competitive, but they see trustbusting as somewhat beside the point of regulation and democratic oversight. They share this perspective with the tech journalist Kara Swisher, who has called in The Times for a national privacy law as well as increased funding for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector.\n\nDipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, goes one step further, claiming that Facebook should be treated as a public utility, like water and electric companies. He writes in the Harvard Business Review, \u201cFacebook and firms like it have become natural monopolies that necessitate a novel, stringent set of regulations to obstruct their capitalistic overreaches and protect the public against ingrained economic exploitation.\u201d\n\nFacebook is being vilified\n\nReports of Facebook\u2019s monopoly are exaggerated, writes Bloomberg\u2019s editorial board. Dominance in a market, it says, should not be mistaken for a lack of competition:\n\nAs successful as Facebook is, there\u2019s little stopping other companies from doing things better. In fact, they already are: Nearly all of Facebook\u2019s constituent services \u2014 messaging, video sharing and so forth \u2014 face competition from apps around the world.\n\nFacebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has argued that the company faces a great deal of competition from Chinese tech companies, which would benefit from a policy like Ms. Warren\u2019s. \u201cYou could break us up, you could break other tech companies up, but you actually don\u2019t address the underlying issues people are concerned about,\u201d she said in May.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, writes CNBC\u2019s Matt Rosoff, calls to break up Facebook or regulate it like a public utility ignore the fact that it isn\u2019t strictly necessary to modern life as water and electricity are:\n\nHughes and others have cited historical precedents such as the government\u2019s breakup of Standard Oil and AT&T as a justification for stricter antitrust regulation against tech giants. But these companies not only had clear monopolies with pricing power that hurt consumers, they also offered products that were vital to the economy. \u2026 Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are only three of many ways people can communicate digitally, and while many people spend hours every week using them, they are replaceable and inessential.\n\nIn the end, writes Jim Geraghty for National Review, the fault is not in our tech overlords, but in ourselves:", "description": "Elizabeth Warren has squared off with Mark Zuckerberg.", "authors": ["Spencer Bokat-Lindell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/opinion/03debatable/03debatable-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
