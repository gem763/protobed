And just that word \u2014 pressure \u2014 triggered an avalanche of thoughts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s catchers have a story to tell\n\nThey could be applied to a September series in Miami, or a June series in Cincinnati, or even a high-stakes start against the Dodgers at 6:40 p.m. They illustrated how baseball players, or at least this baseball player, view the concept (or myth) of added pressure in such an unrelenting sport. They were Scherzer\u2019s view of what he and his teammates bear whenever, and wherever, they take the field.\n\nHere they are:\n\n\u201cI would put it more like this \u2026 No matter what point of your career, young guys, old guys, anyone, any time you are playing this game there is an incredible amount of pressure to perform. That whether it be team pressure, to stay here, to fight for a job, to win a job \u2026 to establish yourself in the big leagues, to continue to try to keep establish yourself in the big leagues, whether it\u2019s contract negotiations, guys going through arbitration, [expletive] man, everybody has [expletive ] \u2026\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYour performance is going to get compensated, that\u2019s just the game. You have that pressure always underneath you on a team with millions of dollars. If you actually stop to think about it for a second, it\u2019s crazy. What these individual games mean, the gravity, the weight what we\u2019re playing for every day, for ourselves and the team. And somehow you have to be able to just tune that all out. Somehow.\n\n\u201cSomehow you just have to be able to go out there and do your job. There might be a day when something changes and you can\u2019t perform under pressure or distractions or you can\u2019t do what it\u2019s going to take to continue to perform. You always have to handle it. The real pressure, though, is to win here, even though we are all dealing with something. You just deal with it and give yourself up to the goal that everyone shares, which is to win. It\u2019s wild if you think about it, man. Like really, to not think about how much each [expletive] game means to you and say I\u2019m just going to go do my job, even if it\u2019s not the job I want, because I\u2019m getting paid to. Like, really. That\u2019s what the game is to us.\u201d\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s approach to his last 15 pitches explains everything about him\n\nThat\u2019s the guy who will soon pitch for the Nationals\u2019 life. Will there be pressure? Sure.
