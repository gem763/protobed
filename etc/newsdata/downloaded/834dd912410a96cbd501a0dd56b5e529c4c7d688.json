It represents a strategy of psychological manipulation reminiscent of that of Shakespeare\u2019s Petruchio in \u201cThe Taming of the Shrew.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s mind tricks, seldom noticed, are an essential complement to its nuclear posturing. Bombs and missiles may in Pyongyang\u2019s adversaries trigger anxiety, but strategic deception plants soothing hopes of denuclearization. Provocations create crises, while post-provocation cajolement reaps tens of billions of dollars worth of blandishments. That\u2019s the decades-old carrot-and-stick strategy: provocations, de-escalation, negotiation, win concessions.\n\nWith patience and guile, Pyongyang\u2019s post-abuse sweet talk may literally disarm both the U.S forces stationed in South Korea and South Korea itself. Already, otherwise intelligent folks in government in Seoul and Washington are resigning themselves to living with a nuclear North Korea under the escapist fantasy that the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), instead of seeking the maximalist goal of reunifying the Korean peninsula on its own terms, is but a paranoid regime moved merely by the minimalist goal of muddling through \u2014 in perpetuity \u2014 as the perpetual inferior Korean state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf the Kim Jong Un Kim Jong UnTrump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' The tiger that didn't purr: For Xi Jinping, it's not personal, it's just business North Korea labels unsuccessful nuclear talks with US 'sickening' MORE regime indeed were but a poor player content just to get by, what explains its preemptive actions since the made-for-TV meeting between President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' US moves British ISIS suspects from Syria amid Turkish invasion MORE and Kim at the inter-Korean border village on June 30?\n\nThree weeks after this \u201chistoric\u201d moment, on July 22, Chinese and Russian warplanes held an unprecedented \u2014 or, \u201chistoric\u201d \u2014 combined drill flying through South Korea\u2019s Air Defense Identification Zone at will, as another Russian plane brazenly entered South Korean airspace. The pressure tactic against Seoul, the weakest link in the U.S.-led trilateral (with Japan) alliance structure in Northeast Asia, gave wind to North Korea\u2019s game of driving wedges among the three democracies. The following day, Kim, showed off an upgraded nuclear submarine likely capable of launching multiple nuclear warheads and, that same week, \u201cguided\u201d the launch of new ballistic missiles that can hit every part of South Korea.\n\nFollowing the successful missile test, Kim accused South Korean President Moon Jae-In, who has staked his presidency on rapprochement with the North, of \u201csuicidal acts\u201d by purchasing U.S. F-35 stealth planes and planning for combined military drills with the U.S. in August. Kim clarified that the missiles were a \u201cwarning\u201d against \u201cSouth Korean military warmongers.\u201d On July 27, which North Korea celebrates each year as \u201cDay of Victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War,\u201d Kim struck a less bellicose tone and attended a National Symphony Orchestra concert.\n\nOn July 27, 1953, the ceasefire agreement to the Korean War was signed by representatives from the United Nations, China and North Korea (South Korea refused to sign it). Remembered by only very few in the United States as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, the date is all but forgotten in the 15 other nations that under the U.N. banner sent troops to defend South Korea against the North. But, still, the date marks the start of the de facto peace that has held in the peninsula and the contrasting vicissitudes of national fortune for North and South Korea.\n\nNorth Korea marks the date both in remembrance of the perils of the past and as a resolve to eliminate future threats to regime-preservation by achieving its revolutionary goal of national reunification, which the North Korean Constitution defines as \u201cthe supreme national task.\u201d Its false claim that the South, supported by the U.S., started the war and that the North ultimately prevailed over the invaders is not mere propaganda. The narrative undergirds the raison d\u2019etre of the DPRK and its unfinished ultimate task.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince late July, Kim has taken a significant leap toward this goal \u2014 not necessarily with spectacular military exploits but with psychological manipulation through a barrage of 10 additional short-range ballistic missile tests, punctuated by a submarine-launched ballistic missile last week.\n\nThese low-level provocations portend greater threats to peace to come. By dialing back the degree of his threat to encompass only the region, while dangling the possibility of peace and reconciliation, Kim has conditioned Seoul and Washington to accept Pyongyang\u2019s smaller threat as a fact of life. To date, President Moon has assiduously avoided commenting on the North\u2019s new, maneuverable, hard-to-detect, nuclear-capable missile tests, while President Trump actively downplayed their threat. Self-censorship, in fear of greater provocations, has been achieved.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea fast approaches nuclear breakout while the U.S. and South Korea have drastically scaled down military readiness. Next, through more graduated escalation and dramatic de-escalation, North Korea will seek to trick the U.S. to accept its intercontinental ballistic missiles-borne nuclear warheads as fait accompli \u2014 a reality the U.S. can live with.\n\nThis mind trick stratagem runs in tandem with North Korea\u2019s nuclear strategy. As its threat capabilities grow rapidly, Pyongyang will sue for a disingenuous peace agreement with the U.S. under the guise of living in constant fear of a preemptive U.S. strike. The Trump administration, more than any of its predecessors, appears amenable to such \u201cpeace\u201d talks.\n\nA peace deal, as pacifying as it may sound, would immediately strip the United Nations Command, formed in wartime by the U.N. Security Council, of its legitimacy, and call into question the justification for the presence of U.S. troops in South Korea. This would further entrap the risk-averse South as a captive of the revisionist North. And the Kim regime would be well positioned to effect its long-held objectives of \u201cdenuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\u201d which Pyongyang defines as U.S. troop withdrawal and dislodgement of the U.S. extended nuclear deterrence from the region, including Japan.\n\nAn emasculated peace in the Korean peninsula based on fear instead of deterrence may lead to the retrenchment of U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific that further emboldens America\u2019s main adversary, an expansionist China. A major shift in the global balance of power could ensue.\n\nTo prevent war, Washington must read its adversary correctly. The North Korean leadership, though backward and bizarre, is not to be underestimated. Even in its early years, Pyongyang exhibited sophistication in the art of deception. Three weeks before its large-scale invasion of the South, Pyongyang proposed to Seoul the creation of a joint parliament with a specific timetable and venues for preparatory meetings and the inauguration of the new inter-Korean political body. On June 19, 1950, just six days before starting the war, Pyongyang again prodded Seoul with a revised plan.\n\nThe U.S. must eschew cheap peace and showy summitry. It must stop accommodating Pyongyang\u2019s provocations. It must stop using North Korean lexicon such as \u201c70 years of war and hostility,\u201d which further emboldens Pyongyang and its supporters to paint the U.S. as the culprit. Instead, the U.S. must enforce sanctions against North Korea, levying nine-digit fines on Pyongyang\u2019s accomplices. Only with financial leverage gained should Washington resume negotiations with Pyongyang. True peace and full verification of Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearization can be achieved only with a free and open North Korea.\n\nThe alternative means not only failed negotiations, but may spell the beginning of the demise of the Pax Americana in Pacific Asia, punctuated, at long last, by the proclamation of a Korean banns of marriage and a real \u201cVictory Day\u201d for the DPRK.\n\nSung-Yoon Lee is Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor of Korean Studies and assistant professor at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University.
