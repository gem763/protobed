But don\u2019t get too complacent with those long lazy evenings and weekend barbecues \u2013 fraudsters aren\u2019t taking a break.\n\nIn fact, there has been a new raft of serious warnings to consumers about several scams that are particularly effective.\n\nSo what are the scams doing the rounds this summer? Here are some of the main trends right now \u2013 just remember that all the standard scams are still out there too.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAutomated bank calls\n\nUK Finance has warned people to be wary of automated phone calls purporting to be from their bank or credit card provider.\n\nVictims say they received an automated call claiming there has been suspicious activity on their account and that they need to be verified. They are then connected to a fraudster.\n\nWorryingly, the criminals may already have information about their potential victims, said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance.\n\n\u201cFraudsters may already have some information about you, so don\u2019t take this as confirmation that their approach is genuine,\u201d she said. \u201cNever give out any personal information if you are at all suspicious.\n\n\u201cInstead, take five to stop and think, and then contact your bank directly on a number that you can trust, such as the one on their official website.\u201d\n\nUniversal Credit scam\n\nOne of the most heartbreaking scams of the summer has attacked some of the most financially vulnerable.\n\nThe BBC claims that fraudsters have stolen tens of millions of pounds by posing as Department for Work and Pensions staff and stealing victims\u2019 personal details. These fraudsters then apply for the advance loans offered to new claimants and steal part of it.\n\nOften the first time the claimant realises they have been scammed is when they receive a letter explaining that they will be repaying the advance they have received.\n\nTesco texts\n\nCustomers of Tesco have been warned by the supermarket to disregard texts claiming they have a parcel waiting.\n\nThese scam texts are designed to steal customers\u2019 bank details. The messages claim that there is a package waiting for the recipient because they have won a supermarket prize draw. They are asked to check and confirm their details by clicking on a link.\n\nThat link takes the potential victim to a scam website that looks like a convincing Tesco page, then collects their data. The shopper is asked to pay a \u00a32 delivery charge, giving the fraudsters the information they need to steal more from their account.\n\nHMRC scams\n\nEarlier this year, HMRC revealed that in 2018 alone it received more than 10,000 reports of scammers ringing taxpayers and purporting to be from the tax office.\n\nHMRC has taken steps to prevent those criminals from spoofing official phone numbers to make their calls more plausible and hopes that because fraudsters will now use less credible numbers they should be easier to identify.\n\nTheir actions may make it easier to identify scammers \u2013 but it won\u2019t stop them calling.\n\nHead of Action Fraud, Pauline Smith, said: \u201cPhone calls are one of the top ways for fraudsters to make contact with their victims. Between April 2018 and March 2019, one in four phishing reports made to Action Fraud were about fraudulent phone calls.\u201d\n\nHoliday booking scam\n\nIf you\u2019ve left it to the last minute to book your summer holiday then there\u2019s a real risk you\u2019re in a rush to find a decent deal. That can make you particularly vulnerable to fraudsters.\n\nCyber security firm McAfee surveyed 2,000 Britons and found that one in five said they had been scammed or come close to being scammed when booking a holiday online, with half of victims losing between \u00a31,000 and \u00a33,000 as a result.\n\nAnd it\u2019s would-be holidaymakers who are seeking a bargain that are the most likely to be caught out, with crooks using fake deals to drive footfall to malicious websites that steal data and install malware.\n\nRaj Samani, chief scientist at McAfee, urges caution when booking, saying: \u201cWe strongly advise people to validate deals, holiday rentals and flights directly via trusted brands\u2019 websites, instead of clicking on links and pop-ups offering bargains.\n\n\u201cOnce they\u2019ve validated its authenticity, all communication and payment should be conducted via that trusted platform to help keep personal and financial information out of hackers\u2019 hands.\u201d\n\nFake ticket scams\n\nSummer months mean festivals, sporting events and outdoor gigs \u2013 but Action Fraud has found that scam victims have lost more than \u00a31.6m in a year trying to buy tickets for them.\n\nAdam French, Which? consumer rights specialist, said: \u201cThe sad reality is that the demand for tickets to high profile gigs and sporting events is a hotbed for fraudsters with many people not only left significantly out of pocket, but also missing out because they have been sold a fake ticket.\n\n\u201cOur advice is that if you haven\u2019t bought your ticket directly from an official source, you will likely pay over the odds and there is no guarantee your ticket will get you in. It is worth doing a bit of research before you commit.\u201d", "description": "The summer\u00a0should be a time to relax and enjoy whatever weather we get.
