The knifeman apparently converted to Islam 10 years ago.\n\nMickael Harpon, a 45-year-old police computer expert with 15 years\u2019 experience on the force, was shot dead by fellow officers on Thursday, after killing four people and wounding two in a stabbing rampage at police headquarters in Paris.\n\nThough terrorism was not declared the motive in the attack, the case was handed over to the country\u2019s anti-terrorism prosecutor on Friday. The prosecutor said on Saturday that Harpon followed a \u201cradical vision of Islam,\u201d following media reports a day earlier that he had converted to the faith 18 months prior to the attack.\n\nAlso on rt.com Anti-terrorism prosecutors take over Paris knife attack probe \u2013 reports\n\nHowever, authorities now say the suspect converted to Islam around 10 years ago, and displayed signs of \u201clatent radicalization.\u201d He also exchanged 33 text messages with his wife in the runup to the attack, all of which were of a religious nature, prosecutors said on Saturday.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said that Harpon \u2013 whose rampage was ended with a shot to the head from an automatic rifle \u2013 had \u201cnever shown any behavioral problems\u201d during his time with the force.
