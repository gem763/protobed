Because the compounds are able to dissolve in oils, they accumulate in fatty tissue. In marine mammals, mothers can pass the chemicals on to their calves during pregnancy and lactation.\n\n\u201cWe suspect that elevated concentrations of PCBs can alter the reproduction of marine mammals, leading to a decrease of the number of newborns, affecting the renewal of the population,\u201d said Krishna Das, an associate professor at the University of Li\u00e8ge, in Belgium.\n\nPCBs, which were once popular as lubricants and hydraulic fluids, can disrupt hormone receptors and affect the immune system, said Das, who co-authored the study.\n\nFrank Mattig, an ornithologist at the University of Oldenburg, in Germany, who was not involved in the study, said the findings echo what scientists have discovered in other marine species. Mattig, who studies the impact of PCBs and mercury on sea birds, said top predators such as dolphins and whales were particularly likely to accumulate high levels of toxins.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear at what levels the chemicals are harmful, but other studies have shown they pose a health risk in high concentrations, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s good reason why they\u2019re banned,\u201d he said.\n\nThe researchers called for greater efforts to eliminate the dangerous chemicals, including safe disposal of stocks and equipment, reducing leakage from landfills and limiting the dredging of PCB-laden rivers and estuaries.", "description": "High levels of mercury and banned industrial fluids, found in blubber and skin, can impact reproduction", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb0d96504fd962198fead821b4d18fa6cf671e46/163_279_3939_2363/master/3939.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=91f6e8f7c4478c73b6c2fea1df2c16c7"}
