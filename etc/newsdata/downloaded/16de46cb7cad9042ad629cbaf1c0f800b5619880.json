REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has launched an initiative that would allow users to access its Alexa, Microsoft Corp\u2019s Cortana and multiple other voice-controlled virtual assistant services from a single device.\n\nThe move comes as competition has intensified among global technology companies to dominate the market for voice assistants, which are commonly housed in smart speakers and mobile devices.\n\nThe notable exclusions from Amazon\u2019s \u2018Voice Interoperability Initiative\u2019 are Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Assistant, Apple Inc\u2019s Siri and Samsung Electronics Co\u2019s Bixby.\n\nGoogle was approached by Amazon but only over the weekend, giving it a very small time frame to evaluate the proposal, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\n\u201cWe just heard about this initiative and would need to review the details, but in general we\u2019re always interested in participating in efforts that have the broad support of the ecosystem and uphold strong privacy and security practices,\u201d a Google spokesperson said.\n\nThe initiative, which has been supported by more than 30 companies, also includes Salesforce.com\u2019s Einstein.\n\nChip companies including Intel Corp, Qualcomm Inc, MediaTek Inc and NXP Semiconductors NV will develop the related hardware, Amazon said.\n\nSpotify, Tencent, Baidu, BMW, Bose, Harman, Orange, Sonos, Sony Audio Group are also supporting the partnership.\n\nMicrosoft and Amazon have collaborated in the past. The two companies two years ago announced that their voice assistants will be able to talk to each other, a rare move in itself as most virtual assistants are known to use data from their own ecosystems and not talk to one another.", "description": "Amazon.com Inc has launched an initiative that would allow users to access its Alexa, Microsoft Corp's Cortana and multiple other voice-controlled virtual assistant services from a single device.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433469563&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1YY", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
