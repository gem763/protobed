I've got enough on my plate.\"\n\nMr McDonnell said he did not think Labour MPs would go through the Government lobby on Saturday once they studied the detail of the deal.\n\n\"I don't believe there are Labour MPs out there who will not think through the detail of this deal and then when they see the impact, particularly environmental, consumers' and workers' rights, will vote for it,\" Jeremy Corbyn's right-hand man added.\n\nBut SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon warned that Labour will \"never be forgiven\" if they let party rebels deliver Boris Johnson's Brexit deal on a \"nod and a wink\" from party chiefs.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nShe warned that voting for the deal \"would be the end for Labour in Scotland\" as she pledged her MPs would never vote to deliver the PM's deal.\n\nMs Sturgeon said: \"This is a worse deal that Theresa May's in every way.\"\"It puts Scotland at a competitive disadvantage,\" she added.Ms Sturgeon confirmed her party would back a second referendum or an election.\n\nMr Johnson told ITV News that his deal \"busts\" the UK out of the Northern Ireland backstop agreed by his predecessor Theresa May .\n\nPressed on whether he could rally MPs to back his Brexit deal, Mr Johnson said: \"I think there is a is a very clear case for all of us to get this done and that is because, I don't know what you feel, but I sense from my own constituents in Uxbridge, and across the country people want us to deliver now and parliamentarians whether they're Labour, Lib Dems, Plaid, Scottish nationalists we all want to, or DUP we all want to move on.\"\n\nAsked whether Saturday's vote was the biggest thing he has done professionally, the PM said: \"Well I wouldn't deny that, I think it's a very big moment for our country.\n\n\"But also its a big moment for our democracy and parliamentarians because I do think we have a choice, which is we have to consider how long we can delay and seem to frustrate what was a pretty clear democratic expression of the will of the people and I think that it would be a great and a fine thing if we could get it done and come together tomorrow.\"", "description": "The government has unveiled a series of pledges around workers' rights ahead of the Brexit vote - but Labour rejected them", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Anthony Harvey Rex", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650546.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BELGIUM-EU-SUMMIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
