Devin Nunes\u2019 (R-Calif.) on Monday announced he is now refusing to answer journalists\u2019 questions about the Ukraine scandal, calling reporters who quiz him over the story \u201cassassins.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are chasing daily conspiracy theories on this Ukraine hoax,\u201d the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee told Fox News host Tucker Carlson, in reference to the whistleblower complaint alleging President Donald Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on his potential 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cAnd so what I have been trying to tell my colleagues, that if these are mainstream reporters and they\u2019re out there asking you questions about conspiracy theories, about Trump, and what do you think about, did you send anybody to this place. I mean, every day is a new conspiracy theory,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd when I walk down the halls, I have to continue to tell these reporters that \u2018look, I\u2019m not going to talk to you in this lifetime or the next,\u2019\u201d claimed Nunes, a frequent defender of the president. \u201cBecause these aren\u2019t real reporters. They are assassins. They are assassins that are taking information from the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee and they are spreading it out there,\u201d he added, without citing any evidence.\n\n\u201cThey are DNC operatives,\u201d Carlson replied.\n\nNunes said \u201cwe need a free and fair press but that\u2019s not we have today.\u201d\n\nCarlson, who frequently (but not always) uses his widely watched primetime show to stump for Trump, countered by claiming \u201cwe\u2019re not always rushing reflexively to defend Trump on everything. I don\u2019t work for Trump. I say what I think. These people work for the Democratic Party. They\u2019re just hacks.\u201d\n\nNunes has previously described the Ukraine scandal, which last month prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, a \u201cgrotesque spectacle.\u201d\n\nCheck out the clip here:\n\nRelated...\n\nSeth Meyers Skewers Sean Hannity's Latest Ridiculous Defense Of Donald Trump\n\nEx-Ethics Chief: Officials Who Defend Trump Are Waging 'War on Democracy'\n\nJimmy Kimmel Mocks Trump's Baghdadi Ramblings By Showing How Obama Handled Bin Laden\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
