Not a thing.\"\n\nIt's unclear from the indictment what offensive comments Wilkins was accused of making, and whether the audio recording Freeman threatened him with was ever released. The 2014 plot was never carried out and Freeman was not murdered.\n\nThe grand jury also accused Wilkins of \"withholding knowledge of a credible threat\" against Freeman and failing to alert authorities and investigate the potential crime.\n\nWilkins has served as sheriff since 2009 and was most recently re-elected in 2018. He's still listed as the sheriff on Granville County's website, and his office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the charges against him.\n\nHe has been released from custody on $20,000 bond, The News & Observer reported.\n\nNOW WATCH: I swapped out my daily skincare products for cheaper versions found on Amazon under $15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and some surprised me", "description": "Granville County Sheriff Brindell Wilkins urged someone to kill a deputy, saying, \"The only way you gonna stop him is kill him,\" an indictment says.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RWyDVkPbI.7Pr8dIWeDFmA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/61ceb5686379407109a1f6d20b2a726e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
