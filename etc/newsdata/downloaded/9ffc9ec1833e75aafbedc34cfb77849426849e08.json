Which Did They Choose?", "language": "en", "text": "Meredith Glidden and Taavo Smith decided last winter that it was time to resurrect a plan to buy an apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, after years of renting there. With a 5-year-old in tow, they were looking for a small and relatively new condominium building with quick access to one of the neighborhood\u2019s parks for their daughter.\n\n\u201cWe changed as Williamsburg changed,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cAll the cool people left and were replaced by families, and that sort of happened to us, too.\u201d\n\nThe couple had met about a decade earlier as actors in Chicago before relocating to Williamsburg when Ms. Glidden started graduate school at New York University. Ms. Glidden is now a psychotherapist, and Mr. Smith works at a software consultancy.\n\nTheir first attempt to get into the market was about six years ago. They set a budget in the low $500,000s, but found nothing suitable they could afford. They put that plan on hold when Ms. Glidden became pregnant and was overwhelmed with too many changes at once. At the time, they were renting a two-bedroom in a modern building, paying a little more than $4,000 a month.\n\n[Did you recently buy or rent a home? We want to hear from you. Email: thehunt@nytimes.com]\n\nOnce they restarted their search late last year, they discovered that apartments similar to those they had seen a few years before were selling for much higher prices. But their budget had also grown, into the low $1 million range, though they hoped to avoid the city\u2019s mansion tax, levied on purchases of $1 million or more.\n\nThe couple, both in their late 30s, had no interest in fancy amenities, and weren\u2019t sure they could land a real two-bedroom. \u201cWe went in hoping we could find some place that could hold us as a family that we could afford,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nThey saw a number of not-quite-two-bedrooms, primarily loft and duplex spaces. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much stock in our price range where you could put a second person,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong their choices:", "description": "A couple attempts to find enough space to live with \u2014 and separately from \u2014 their 5-year-old daughter.
