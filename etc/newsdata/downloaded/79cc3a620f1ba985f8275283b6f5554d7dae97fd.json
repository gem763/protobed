Guyger, who is white, was convicted of fatally shooting her black neighbor in his apartment.\n\nKemp, who is black, has also been criticized by activists who wondered whether a black defendant would get the same treatment.\n\nKemp didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\n\nHer former boss, ex-Dallas prosecutor Craig Watkins, says Kemp is guided by faith and that he doesn\u2019t think her actions were out of bounds.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Texas judge who hugged a former Dallas police officer convicted of murder and gave her a Bible is coming under scrutiny over whether she crossed an ethical line.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/dallas_officer_mistaken_apartment_58814_c0-118-6408-3854_s1770x1032.jpg?ec8e4c7a6ac3855c69c26b90301fe6f414691625"}
