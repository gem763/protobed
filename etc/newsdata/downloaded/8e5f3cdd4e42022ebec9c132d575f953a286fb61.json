By Monday morning, the display was removed and the corrections department had launched an internal investigation.\n\nThe agency said the building, a parole office that deals with high-risk sex offenders and gang members, may by its very nature house offensive and obscene items, but officials said that is no excuse for the display and they are still trying to figure out why some of those accoutrements were placed prominently in a street-facing window.\n\n\u201cThe flag has been removed, and we apologise for this profoundly incendiary act,\u201d said Dana Simas, the department press secretary. \u201cThe display of an image representing violence and bigotry is a gross violation of department policy ...
