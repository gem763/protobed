Similarly, we went with neoprene instead of nylon or prints, which we also experimented with, because it seemed to be selling,' Mr Ellis said.\n\nNeoprene naturally curves around a human shape with ease, which Mr Ellis suspects is why it was so revolutionary at the time.\n\nIt became so popular that model Kendall Jenner stumbled on pictures of it and asked for a pair herself.\n\nSince 2013 the duo have become regulars on the rich list and estimate they sell more than 45,000 bikinis a month around the world\n\nSadly Miss Deering and Mr Ellis - who purchased a plush $5million pad on Bondi Beach in 2018 - split at the start of the year, with Erin moving on with fellow Aussie Zachary Keane\n\nErin is pictured with current boyfriend Zachary Keane\n\nAustralia's richest women under 40 1.

Alarna Longes, 40, $30million, beauty\n\nThis saw the sales of Triangl skyrocket in the United States, which is still one of their biggest markets today.\n\n'The celeb endorsement has really helped,' says Mr Ellis.\n\n'But I think people can tell when that comes about organically and naturally, rather than us just pushing our product on people who we want to wear it.\n\n'Plus the price point, which is under $150AUD, is the sweet spot. It's reasonable, but expensive enough to be good quality.'\n\nSince 2013 the duo have become regulars on the rich list and estimate they sell more than 45,000 bikinis a month around the world.\n\nMiss Deering and Mr Ellis - who purchased a plush $5million pad on Bondi Beach in 2018 - split at the start of the year, with Erin moving on with fellow Aussie Zachary Keane.\n\nFrom being 'flat broke' to sporting designer brands like Balenciaga on a night out with friends, Miss Deering and Mr Ellis often can't believe just how far they've come\n\nTriangl is still exclusively online with no plans as yet to build a brick and mortar store\n\nTheir Instagram photos feature holidays to Hawaii and Europe, with plenty of Triangl bikini snaps in between - hinting at the life of luxury Miss Deering now leads.\n\nFrom being 'flat broke' to sporting designer brands like Balenciaga on a night out with friends, Miss Deering and Mr Ellis often can't believe just how far they've come.\n\nThey now sell bikinis in a multitude of fabrics and styles, leading the charge in well-priced pieces.\n\nTriangl is still exclusively online with no plans as yet to build a brick and mortar store.", "description": "A swimwear designer worth $35million - who counts Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian as fans - is one of the 10 richest Australians under the age of 40.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd", "Sophie Haslett For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/02/20161184-0-image-a-5_1571965860031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
