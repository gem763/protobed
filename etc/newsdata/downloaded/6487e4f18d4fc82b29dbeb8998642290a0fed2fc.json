It is extremely unjust to attack them, in my opinion,\" Trichet told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" Friday, calling the response by some newspapers \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\n\"This is not the same in the U.S., because in the United States, it is the executive branch chief himself who is embarking on some attacks, even personal attacks.
