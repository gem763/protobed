That\u2019s what the Draconids promise to deliver.\n\nThough meteors will continue to streak across the night sky through Thursday, Tuesday night likely offers the best chance to see at least a handful of shooting stars \u2014 that is if the weather cooperates.\n\nAnd while the Draconids aren\u2019t typically dramatic, it\u2019s possible they could surprise some patient sky gazers.\n\n\u201cMeteor showers are notorious for defying the most carefully crafted forecasts,\u201d according to EarthSky. \u201cSo you never know for sure what\u2019s up in a meteor shower unless you look.\u201d\n\nGiving the Draconids a chance won\u2019t cost you much sleep; the best viewing will be in the early evening, during the few hours after dusk \u2014 no need to stay up past midnight.\n\nThe Draconid meteor shower is caused by the intersection of Earth\u2019s orbit with the trail of debris left by the comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. When the bits of ice and dust left behind by the comet collide with Earth\u2019s atmosphere, they burn up, creating bright streaks across the night sky.\n\nThe best viewing will be in the Northern Hemisphere. The shooting stars will appear to emanate from the Draco constellation, located above the Big Dipper and Polaris.\n\nBecause the moon is almost full, only the brightest meteors are likely to be visible to the naked eye. While this year\u2019s Draconid shower may be less-than-stellar, the meteor shower occasionally produces banner shows \u2014 like in 2011 and 2018.\n\n\u201cMost years, we pass through gaps between filaments, maybe just grazing one or two as we go by,\u201d Bill Cooke, who heads NASA\u2019s Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said in a news release. \u201cOccasionally, though, we hit one nearly head on \u2014 and the fireworks begin.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Get ready for a modest midweek meteor shower.
