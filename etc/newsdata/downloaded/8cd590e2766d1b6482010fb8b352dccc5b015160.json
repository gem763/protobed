Retired Keith Ackerley, 72, (right) said he thought the election was a distraction from the real issues\n\nWorkington statistics: Fewer graduates, higher unemployment and more over-65s than the national average Population: 32,433 Sex: 49.3% male, 50.7% female Unemployment: 9.2% (average for England - 4.3%) Have a degree-level qualification: 15% (average for England - 27.4) Age breakdown v average for England: 0 - 15: 17.9% (19.1); 16 - 64: 61% (62.8); Over 65: 21.1% (18) Ethnicity: 85.4% white (UK average - 86), 20.2 BME First language: 92% English Place of birth: 83.5% England, 9.4%, other countries outside the UK and Ireland Life expectancy - Male: 78.9 (average for England - 79.5) Female: 82.3 (83.1) Relationship status: 46.6% married, 34.6 single Four most common religions: 59.4% Christian, 24.7 no religion, 5 Muslim, 1.5 Hindu.

It's a cliche that belongs in the 1970s.'\n\nRyan Rodgers, who has lived in Workington all his life, agreed that things on the ground were more complicated than the political buzzword suggested .\n\nThe boiler operator, 37, said: 'There are so many sides to the story... I think more things than Brexit will influence the way people vote.'\n\nHe added: 'I work for a Swedish company and I am regretting voting for Brexit... I don't agree that the \"Workington Man\" is going to have a big influence on the election result.'\n\nHotelier Grant Payne, 74, also thought the stereotype is misleading.\n\nHe said: 'I voted to leave the EU but I am not sure people will be focusing on Brexit when they vote in the general election. I think the main focus here will be on jobs.'\n\nAt the last election, Labour won 51% of the vote, with the Conservatives getting 41%, suggesting the Tories would need around six per cent of the voters in the area to switch to them.\n\nRetired industrial process engineer Frederick Chandler, 69, who has lived in Workington since 1991, has traditionally voted Labour but said he may vote Conservative in the general election.\n\nPolitical gurus in the Tory party hope they can cash in place like Workington in December\n\nFrederick Chandler (left) is closer to the 'Workington Man' idea, saying he is considering switching from Labour to the Tories. Jim Thompson, 75, (right) said he felt ignored by the area's Labour MP\n\nKen Hyde said he hoped too many people wouldn't vote for the Brexit Party, so that Jeremy Corbyn 'wouldn't get a look in'\n\nMr Chandler said: 'Normally I have voted Labour but because of the mess parliament has made with Brexit I have got to the stage where I think I would vote for Boris.\n\n'He has a stronger attitude to leaving. He is flamboyant or whatever, that's his character, but I think he has the strongest potential to be able to get us to leave.'\n\nJim Thompson, 75, a retired chemist, added: 'Our Labour MP hasn't taken any notice of us voting to leave.\n\n'I will be voting Conservative. I don't think the people have heard anything from Corbyn. He hasn't made a decision about Brexit - is he on the fence, off the fence, fallen off the fence?'\n\nLord O'Shaughnessy, former Director of Policy for David Cameron, wrote the report from which the Tories' idea of 'Workington Man' emanated. He produced the report for Onward, a group which was founded by Will Tanner (right), a former adviser to Theresa May\n\nWorkington high street today. Some said they welcomed more attention for their area but others felt 'patronised' by the view of voters\n\nA graphic showing where the vote will be won and lost throughout the country in the snap poll taking place on December 12\n\nKen Hyde, 77, a retired site supervisor at the local paper mill, said: 'There's a lot of people that have been staunchly Labour all their lives and they are refusing to vote Labour while Corbyn is in charge.\n\n'I know some people who said they will vote for the Brexit Party instead. I hope to God they don't because that will split the vote and it will be a total disaster if Jeremy Corbyn gets a look in.'\n\nKeith Ackerley, 72, said: 'To be honest, I'm not particularly happy there is an election. It's more time and money spent elsewhere than on the real issues.'\n\n'Workington Man' is the brainchild of Lord O'Shaughnessy, a former Director of Policy for David Cameron, who wrote a report for Onward, a group which was founded by Will Tanner, a former adviser to Theresa May.\n\nWorkington has traditionally voted Labour but is the kind of constituency Boris Johnson is hoping to win over before December 12\n\nThe likely manifestos for Boris Johnson's Tories and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party for the upcoming December 12 election\n\nThe use of voter stereotypes as a targeting tactic dates back to at least Margaret Thatcher's repeated electoral wins in the 1980s where the working-class 'Essex man' switched allegiance from Labour to the Tories.\n\nVoter stereotypes used during previous elections include the 1996 'Mondeo man', the 1997 'Worcester woman', and the 2003 'Bacardi Breezer Generation' of 18 to 25-year-olds, among others.\n\nMr Tanner hit back today after the idea was branded 'misogynistic'.\n\nHe defended the idea, tweeting: 'The key archetypal swing voter is disproportionately likely, statistically, to be male & concentrated in Workington.\n\n'Labour won a landslide by targeting Mondeo Man and Worcester Woman in 1997.'\n\nBoris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn trade blows at fiery last PMQs before election battle: PM draws battle lines for December 12 poll with promise of 'unprecedented NHS funding' and attack on Labour leader over 'flip-flopping' Brexit stance\n\nBy James Tapsfield, Political Editor for MailOnline\n\nBoris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn traded the first blows of the election battle at a fiery PMQs session today.\n\nMr Johnson insisted the Tories are the real party of the NHS as he faced off against the Labour leader for the last time before Parliament dissolves for the campaign.\n\nHe dismissed claims from Mr Corbyn that the government is preparing to 'sell out' the health service in a trade deal with the US.\n\nMr Johnson said the NHS was receiving 'unrivalled and unprecedented sums of taxpayers money' under the Conservatives. Mr Corbyn was 'out of his mind' to try to stop the public and private sectors cooperating to provide better care, he insisted.\n\nMr Johnson sought to rally his troops for the pre- Christmas showdown by attacking Jeremy Corbyn at a brutal PMQs session in the Commons\n\nThe clashes came as Tory and Labour strategists finalise their plans for a 'mega tough' and incredibly volatile struggle, where local factors are expected to play a pivotal role.\n\nExperts have warned that Mr Johnson's strident call to 'get Brexit done' and blueprint for a loose, Canada-style relationship with the EU could lose his party at least 20 seats to the unashamedly pro-Remain Lib Dems and SNP.\n\nKey battlegrounds will include Cheltenham in Gloucestershire and Stirling north of the border.\n\nTo offset the anticipated losses the Conservatives must make significant progress against Labour - probably requiring at least 50 gains to get Mr Johnson the working majority that he craves.\n\nWill Boris Johnson switch to a safer seat? The PM faces a tough fight to hold his own constituency \u2013 leading to claims he could switch to a safer seat to avoid the risk of humiliation. Boris Johnson is MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where he has a majority of just 5,034 over Labour. It would take a swing of just over 5 per cent to snatch the seat \u2013 and Corbynista group Momentum will target it with hundreds of volunteers. Their 'Unseat Boris' campaign would make Mr Johnson the first premier to lose his seat in an election in modern times. Labour claims he will announce in the next few days that he will take the 'chicken run' and stand for a seat with a much larger Tory majority. Downing Street described the rumours as 'tosh and nonsense'. Uxbridge in West London \u2013 traditionally true blue \u2013 has been represented by Mr Johnson since 2015. When he first stood, he clocked up a majority of 10,695. But this halved in Theresa May's disastrous election of 2017. Labour has chosen Ali Milani, a 25-year-old Muslim, as their candidate.\n\nThe campaign is getting under way after MPs finally backed a Government Bill for a poll on Thursday, December 12, after weeks of dither and delay by opposition parties.\n\nMr Johnson said a 'revitalised' House of Commons would let Britain leave the EU in the new year.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, who backed an election just 24 hours after refusing to do so, said Labour would kick out the 'reckless' Conservatives and deliver a socialist Britain.\n\nThe Prime Minister told MPs the election \u2013 the first in December since 1923 \u2013 would deliver Brexit after months of 'unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism'.\n\nHe later addressed Tory backbenchers, giving what one claimed was a 'King Henry V to Agincourt-type speech'.\n\nHe told them the campaign would be 'mega-tough', and urged them to pull out all the stops for victory.\n\nConservative MP Robert Halfon said: 'He said forget about the polls, forget about everything you read, this is going to be an incredibly tough election.\n\n'No one wants to do an election in December, it's going to be mega-tough and it's going to be one of the toughest elections we could ever do.'\n\nThe election breakthrough came after the Liberal Democrats and SNP broke ranks with Labour and backed an early poll in which they hope to benefit from Mr Corbyn's unpopularity with voters.\n\nBut election experts yesterday warned a 2019 vote \u2013 the third General Election in four years \u2013 was likely to be the most unpredictable thanks to the prevalence of smaller parties.\n\nBoris Johnson (left in Downing Street last night) is facing off with Jeremy Corbyn (right leaving his London home this morning) in the Commons later\n\nLabour MPs 'don't want to back Jeremy Corbyn as PM' as former leadership hopeful Owen Smith QUITS and more than 100 of his own troops REFUSE to get behind snap election\n\nJeremy Corbyn faces a huge battle to keep Labour together during the snap election today amid claims some of his own MPs don't want to see him as PM.\n\nThe veteran left-winger insists he is 'ready' for the dramatic pre-Christmas contest, describing it as a 'once in a generation chance for change'.\n\nBut the scale of infighting within the party was underlined last night when more than 100 of his own MPs ignored his orders to back holding a snap election.\n\nMeanwhile, former leadership contender Owen Smith has announced he will not be standing in his Pontypridd constituency, citing 'political and personal reasons'.\n\nFormer leadership contender Owen Smith has announced he will not be standing in his Pontypridd constituency, citing 'political and personal reasons'\n\nLabour MPs have ridiculed Mr Corbyn and his aides for believing they are on the 'brink of a brave new socialist dawn', despite grim polls for the party and him personally.\n\nOne told MailOnline: 'They think it is going to happen, he will be walking into No10. A lot of Labour MPs don't even want that.'\n\nLabour was effectively dragged kicking and screaming into backing an election last night.\n\nFor weeks the shadow cabinet and backbenchers had been holding back Mr Corbyn and his closest allies, who were desperate for a poll that is widely seen as the 70-year-old's last chance for power.\n\nBut despite voting down a motion to call an election on Monday, Labour was outflanked when it became clear Boris Johnson had secured Liberal Democrat and SNP support for a Bill triggering a ballot in December.", "description": "Men from Workington, a coastal town in the North West, today trashed the buzzword being used in Westminster, saying it describes someone from the 1970s, not 2019.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/17/20387684-0-image-a-182_1572454821664.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
