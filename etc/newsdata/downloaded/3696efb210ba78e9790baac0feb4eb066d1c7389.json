It seems that the chef she spoke with took umbrage not just with the request for a special, non-menu item, but also that they not be charged full price for the meal.\n\nThe email conversation between the potential customer and chef Attila Yilmaz was shared on the Facebook page for PAZAR Food Collective. After emailing the restaurant and explaining that they have an \u201cincredibly restricted diet,\u201d the unnamed diner asked if it would be OK if they just sat at the table and drank while their friends ate.\n\nWhen the restaurant responded that their liquor license only covers them for \u201cdining customers,\u201d the unnamed person responded, \u201cI think we will go elsewhere unless you can provide a lean steak and sweet potato with leaf and sheep\u2019s milk feta or goat\u2019s cheese salad and charge appropriately, not a feast $68 price. I have an intolerance to just about every item on your menu.\u201d\n\nSUBWAY CUSTOMER ROASTED FOR UNUSUAL SANDWICH ORDER: 'THAT'S ACTUALLY SO WRONG'\n\nAt this point, the conversation apparently caught chef Attila Yilmaz\u2019s attention, as he responded, \u201cApologies, just so I\u2019m clear on this, you want to come to our restaurant, don\u2019t like our menu and hence want to create your own menu and want us to cook that for you at a price you determine is fair? Could you please tell me what cut of meat you would like and what price you would like to pay for your dinner?\u201d\n\nWhen the potential customer responded by calling out Yilmaz for his \u201csarcasm,\u201d the chef explained, \u201cQuestion, if I may? If you and seven of your friends were going to a concert and you were the only one who didn\u2019t like the band or their songs, are sensitive to offensive language and had intolerance to loud noise, would you contact the band and ask them to tone it down, lower the volume and edit their playlist and songs so it is more to your taste? Would you then ask for a discounted price when they do this because, well, it\u2019s just not reasonable?\u201d\n\nBALTIMORE RESTAURANT'S DRESS CODE CITED AS DISCRIMINATION: 'THIS IS RACIST AS HELL'\n\nHe then went on to explain that the diner\u2019s requested meal was made up of ingredients that the restaurant doesn\u2019t use and ended the email with, \u201cWe look forward to not feeding you.\u201d\n\nThe no-longer-potential customer responded, \u201cNice. It\u2019s very nice considering I work for a caterer and we accommodate people\u2019s food intolerances every day.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nNot to be deterred, Yilmaz once again responded, this time taking a different approach. \u201cYou work for a caterer,\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s great! What\u2019s your minimum spend? Can I book you to cater for one person? Me? How much for a piece of lean meat, leaf, sheep\u2019s feta and a sweet potato? Can you give me a quote, please? Make sure it\u2019s reasonable\u2026 I\u2019m happy with $68 or less. I will require you to supply a cook, tableware, water, cloth napkins, a waiter, a venue with a chair, table, music, air-conditioning or heating depending on the weather. I will require this for at least a two hour sitting on a Saturday night at 8 p.m. I will need proof that you pay your staff the award rate at 125% for a Saturday and proof of superannuation, workers compensation insurance, et cetera. Please email your quote ASAP.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, Yilmaz explained to them that while he tries to accommodate requests for people with food allergies, \u201cwhen you have someone saying they are on a diet and there is nothing on the menu that they can eat\u2026 you have to say to them, \u201cWell, maybe this isn\u2019t the restaurant for you.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nFox News reached out to PAZAR Food Collective for a comment, but they did not immediately respond.", "description": "This chef clearly doesn\u2019t believe that the customer is always right.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/angry-cook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
