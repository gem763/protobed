For Charles Leclerc who triumphed at the Italian Grand Prix, it is this, his second victory, that will surely be the one that stays with him throughout his life. The 21-year-old\u2019s joy was writ large across his still boyish face as he stood on the podium confronted by a sea of red as the tifosi erupted in a collective celebration of colour, noise and, it must be said, some relief.\n\nLeclerc, at the centre of this ecstatic maelstrom, absorbed their approval as flags and red flares battled for space in the air beneath him, as an emperor surveys his subjects. Last week his debut victory at Spa was tempered by the death of his friend Anthoine Hubert in an F2 race in Belgium. There had been pleasure in his maiden win but delivering here for Ferrari in their home race, the joy was unconfined for him, his team and their fans.\n\nF1: Italian Grand Prix \u2013 live! Read more\n\nIt was impossible not to sense that for everyone wearing red at Monza a great weight had been lifted from their shoulders. Ferrari have not won at home since Fernando Alonso did so here in 2010. This weekend history, always hard to escape here and with this team, had too brought expectation, as it was the 90th edition of the Italian Grand Prix and the 90th anniversary of the foundation of Ferrari in 1929.\n\nIt fell to Ferrari\u2019s chairman, John Elkann, to sum up quite what it meant. \u201cIt\u2019s the best possible way of celebrating our 90 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBravissimo Charles and congratulations to Mattia [Binotto, team principal] and everyone in the Scuderia on this unforgettable day.\u201d\n\nLeclerc took the win from pole but had anything but a serene run to the flag. He was pushed by Lewis Hamilton for the first two-thirds of the race as the British driver put in everything to try to pass him. He could not quite make it however with the Ferrari having a distinct edge in pace and, having used up his tyres in the attempt, Hamilton finished third behind his teammate Valtteri Bottas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Charles Leclerc holds off Lewis Hamilton.

The five-time champion and the young pretender put on a fine fight at the front.\n\nLeclerc held his lead through the pit stops after which Hamilton, on softer rubber, charged at him. They went wheel to wheel approaching the Roggia chicane and as Hamilton went to pass, the pair touched and the championship leader was forced wide. Hamilton claimed Leclerc had not left him a full car\u2019s width as required. The stewards issued only a warning and Leclerc held his own in that he would be no pushover.\n\nIt was controversial and clearly the two differed in their interpretation of the incident afterwards, Hamilton saying the stewards\u2019 decisions lacked consistency.\n\nHamilton continued to harry him and on lap 36 Leclerc locked up at the first chicane and cut the corner, coming back on having just held his lead. The incident was noted but no action was taken.\n\nLewis Hamilton wants a \u2018talk\u2019 with Leclerc after Monza F1 incident Read more\n\nIt had cost him time, however, and Hamilton took advantage and went at him again when Leclerc moved defensively on the approach to Roggia. Leclerc\u2019s move was robust and fearless but again may have been interpreted differently, Hamilton describing it as \u201cdangerous\u201d over team radio.\n\nHamilton\u2019s efforts had also cost him. With his tyres gone, he locked up and ceded second to Bottas who went after Leclerc but could not close the gap.\n\nWhen the season began, Leclerc was firmly the No 2 driver to his teammate Sebastian Vettel. He is now in front of him in the championship. Here he laid down a marker as the top man at the team while Vettel put in another performance he will want to forget.\n\nOn lap six the German lost his rear and span at Ascari. He then hit Lance Stroll\u2019s Racing Point as he rejoined. It was exceptionally dangerous and sent Stroll into a spin as well. The incident was immediately investigated by the stewards and Vettel was penalised with a 10-second stop-go penalty, with which he might feel he escaped lightly before finishing in 13th.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sebastian Vettel (left) comes back on to the track, forcing Lance Stroll of Racing Point to spin.

Cheered to the rafters for every lap, Leclerc held his place and with it the lifelong admiration of the tifosi, whose chanting of his name will surely stay with him forever.\n\nThe championship nonetheless remains firmly in Hamilton\u2019s hands. The British driver leads Bottas by 63 points with Max Verstappen 99 points back in third. Leclerc is now fourth, three points behind Verstappen.\n\nThe two Renaults of Daniel Ricciardo and Nico H\u00fclkenberg were in fourth and fifth. Verstappen, starting from 19th after an engine change, was eighth. Alexander Albon was sixth for Red Bull, with Sergio P\u00e9rez seventh for Racing Point. Alfa Romeo\u2019s Antonio Giovinazzi was in ninth, in front of the McLaren of Lando Norris.", "description": "Charles Leclerc followed up his win in the Belgian Grand Prix by claiming Ferrari\u2019s home race, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton on a bad day for Sebastian Vettel", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d927d358afc83ae3cc1fe5b641aea20b06af49b/85_0_4596_2758/master/4596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=591d669accd1071f376281b50ef69c56", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
