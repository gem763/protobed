When I applied a few years ago, I had no one to ask about what each of the colleges was really like.\n\nEach college\u2019s prospectus says it is \u201copen, welcoming and friendly\u201d. But, having now studied at Oxford, I know that your college is where you\u2019ll be spending the next three to four years of your university life. This choice actually does matter; it\u2019s not a decision to make lightly.\n\nAfter agonising over the choice, in the end I put my future in the hands of a computer programme, which randomly selected for me based on the course I was applying for \u2014 history \u2014 and the colleges that had relatively few applicants for history in 2014.\n\nDo I regret it? No, I couldn\u2019t have imagined loving Somerville, my chosen \u2014 or not chosen \u2014 college, any more than I did. Somerville genuinely was open, welcoming and friendly. You can even walk on the grass \u2014 not something that\u2019s allowed everywhere.", "description": "If you\u2019re struggling to choose an Oxford or Cambridge college, here\u2019s how to make an open application", "authors": ["Naomi Southwell", "James Millar"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2019/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000141615645-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
