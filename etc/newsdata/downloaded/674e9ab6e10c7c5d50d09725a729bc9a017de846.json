But hey: It\u2019s basically Arnold Schwarzenegger, a shotgun and a world of cybernetic hurt.\n\nNeatherrealm Studios just dropped a new gameplay trailer for the latest \u201cKombatant\u201d joining the roster of the latest in its long, gory line of fighting games, Mortal Kombat 11, and it\u2019s a guest character in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.\n\nThis is far from the first guest character in a Mortal Kombat game \u2014 hell, a new version of the Joker, separate from the one Neatherrealm crafted for its excellent DC Comics fighting game series Injustice, is part of the same season pass of Downloadable Content as the T-800 is.\n\nBut there\u2019s something just so weirdly absurd about watching a greying Schwarzenegger (just his likeness, however \u2014 a soundalike provides the decently grizzled lines of dialogue), shotgun in hand, as he stomps around MK\u2019s 2D plane punching and gunning his way through undead ninjas and cybernetically enhanced supersoldiers just like it\u2019s no big deal.\n\nOh, and then his skin occasionally gets burned off by an opponent\u2019s move and he just straight up becomes a Terminator skeleton. Not before he stomps on a man\u2019s testicles so hard they explode, however \u2014 so, just, FYI, this trailer is decidedly NSFW:\n\nBut while Arnold\u2019s general gameplay is pretty vanilla \u2014 sure, he can do site-to-site teleports and that\u2019s cool, but aside from a few bits of tech he\u2019s all punching and shotgunning \u2014 as ever with Mortal Kombat, the over-the-top gore mania comes to play in the special moves, and the Terminator is no exception. I mean, just look at this:\n\nOW. (Image: Neatherrealm Studios)\n\nKneecapping, time-travel-based limb severing, and that\u2019s before letting an army of Terminators blast poor Jax through the chest? Downright unnecessary, that. But cool. Those are perfectly Mortal Kombat levels of unnecessary violence.\n\nIf you want to step into the skinsuit of robo-Arnold yourself, the T-800 arrives as part of Mortal Kombat 11's \u201cKombat Pack\u201d season pass on October 8. If you don\u2019t have the pass, he\u2019ll be available at a later date.", "description": "OK, I mean, it\u2019s actually the T-800, or more specifically, the older version from the upcoming Terminator: Dark Fate.
