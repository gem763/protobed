It will be an attempt to clear the air after Trump was accused by an anonymous whistleblower, without a first hand account of the conversation, of urging the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. In exchange, Ukraine would receive military aid.\n\n....You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nSince the allegation was made, a number of new Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment. Notably, Democrat Senator Dick Durbin, second only to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, also jumped on board.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied any wrong doing and has accused the Bidens of corruption. The Ukrainian government has also issued a statement denying any pressuring from Trump took place.\n\n\u201cI know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,\u201d Prystaiko said during a media interview. \u201cThis conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.\u201d\n\nThe White House has been debating for at least 24-hours whether the transcript should be released. UPDATE: It will not be redacted.\n\nMeanwhile, here's the backstory on Biden's connection to Ukraine. It turns out, he's the one who actually pressured the government to fire a prosecutor looking into his son's business dealings in exchange for loan guarantees.\n\nIt was a foreign policy role Joseph R. Biden Jr. enthusiastically embraced during his vice presidency: browbeating Ukraine\u2019s notoriously corrupt government to clean up its act. And one of his most memorable performances came on a trip to Kiev in March 2016, when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine\u2019s leaders did not dismiss the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption in his own office and among the political elite. The pressure campaign worked. The prosecutor general, long a target of criticism from other Western nations and international lenders, was soon voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament. Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden\u2019s younger son, who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "description": ".09/25/2019 0:32:36AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/cdd80ea5-7d73-4f66-9231-9b3118d3b3b5.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
