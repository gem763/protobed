Level Zero - The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when enhanced by warning or intervention systems Level One \u2013 A small amount of control is accomplished by the system such as adaptive braking if a car gets too close Level Two \u2013 The system can control the speed and direction of the car allowing the driver to take their hands off temporarily, but they have to monitor the road at all times and be ready to take over Level Three \u2013 The driver does not have to monitor the system at all times in some specific cases like on highways but must be ready to resume control if the system requests Level Four \u2013 The system can cope will all situations automatically within defined use but it may not be able to cope will all weather or road conditions. System will rely on high definition mapping Level Five \u2013 Full automation. System can cope with all weather, traffic and lighting conditions. It can go anywhere, at any time in any conditions\n\nAccording to Byton, its 49-inch Shared Experience Display is 'the largest screen ever fitted in a serial production vehicle.'\n\nLast year, the firm said the base model will be able to achieve 250 miles on a charge, while the higher end variant will go up to about 325 miles \u2013 and, Byton claims it will charge incredibly fast.\n\nAt the time, Byton said it is on the verge of achieving a fast-charging system that will \u2018get enough charge for a whole week of urban commuting\u2019 in just the amount of time it takes you to have a cup of coffee.\n\n'Byton's M-Byte represents the transformation of the traditional car into a next-generation smart device for every user,' said Dr. Carsten Breitfeld, CEO and Co-founder of Byton\n\nCo-founder Dr Carson Breitfeld said the car will recharge to a range of 150 miles (249 kilometers) in just 20 minutes.\n\nAnd, in just 30 minutes, the battery will be 80 percent full.\n\nIts cars are designed to be \u2018the next generation of smart devices for shared mobility and autonomous driving.\u2019\n\nAs a result, much of the focus has been put into its smart human-vehicle interface.", "description": "Byton kicked off CES 2019 by revealing the souped up interior of its M-Byte vehicle, complete with additional displays \u2013 including a touchscreen in the middle of the steering wheel.", "authors": ["Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.Com In Las Vegas"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/07/01/8204106-0-image-a-19_1546825762610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-07"}
