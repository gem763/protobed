Books to help make sense of parliament", "language": "en", "text": "If you\u2019re confused by the current political scene, you may or may not be reassured to learn that the people paid to understand it, including political journalists, are also struggling to keep up. Many of the twists and turns in parliament are so unprecedented that it\u2019s not clear whether they are supposed to be happening or not.\n\nEveryone is trying to sound better briefed than they actually are. There\u2019s not even a great deal of point in burying yourself in Erskine May, the parliamentary bible of what MPs can and cannot do, because Speaker Bercow has been more than willing to ignore it too. Still, that weighty tome is now online, so at least you don\u2019t have to haul it around with you on public transport.\n\nThe best book that explains how parliament works, in theory and in practice, is written by a former clerk of the House of Commons, Robert Rogers, and a group of experts. How Parliament Works is now in its eighth edition and is up-to-date on the effects of Brexit on Westminster; what difference a minority government makes; and how it runs itself. It\u2019s clearly written, which makes it handy for students as well as adults who just want to understand the difference between a second reading, secondary legislation and a bill committee.\n\nFor an angry read on how these structures lead to things going wrong, turn to The Blunders of Our Governments by Anthony King and Ivor Crewe, which whisks you through some of the greatest mistakes of the past decades, including the poll tax, and explains how politicians of all colours could have ended up in this mess.\n\nPeople very rarely lie in Westminster. This might sound absurd, but it\u2019s true. What they do is use their words so carefully that only a linguist experienced in politicalese can translate what they actually mean. If a government says it \u201cisn\u2019t considering\u201d proroguing parliament \u2013 as it did recently, before doing just that \u2013 this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it isn\u2019t going to prorogue parliament. The key is the verb: advisers will argue it doesn\u2019t cover a decision that has already been taken. The best lexicon is the very entertaining Would They Lie to You? by Robert Hutton, which will help you understand what politicians are actually saying, while also making you profoundly dispirited about the way politics is conducted. See also Peter Oborne\u2019s The Rise of Political Lying and The Triumph of the Political Class.\n\nA kindlier look at the psyche of MPs is The House of Commons: An Anthropology of MPs at Work by Emma Crewe. It\u2019s a little out of date, but some of the anecdotes are particularly useful. Crewe managed to spend a fair bit of time talking to an eccentric backbencher about how his whips often phoned to check he was definitely rebelling against the party. Most MPs would never give her such access today.\n\nAlso from a previous political era but eEssential to understanding what goes on when MPs decide to vote against their party are two books by the witty politics professor Philip Cowley. The Rebels and Revolts and Rebellions cover the Blair era, but some of those mistakes are being repeated now, or were too risky to contemplate more than a decade ago. If he takes another look at this bunch, his books will run to several volumes.\n\n\u2022 Why We Get the Wrong Politicians by Isabel Hardman is published by Atlantic.", "description": "From Erskine May to The Rise of Political Lying, journalist Isabel Hardman shares the best titles that explain what is happening in UK politics", "authors": ["Isabel Hardman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b617c68d4e2dc2120fc18b58c3acf7c00b232ddc/13_0_2781_1669/master/2781.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8ee77eff16be78e112f790c7f9e5d360", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
