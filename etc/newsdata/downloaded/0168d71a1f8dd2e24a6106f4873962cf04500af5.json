REUTERS/Timothy Aeppel\n\nNonfarm payrolls rose by 130,000, some 28,000 less than analysts expected and a 29,000 drop from July, but average hourly earnings increased slightly and jobless rates remained steady.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed report at best,\u201d said Nela Richardson, investment strategist with Edward Jones in St. Louis. \u201cIt confirms what we knew, that the economy is decelerating.\u201d\n\nFACTORY SLUMP\n\nIn a sign the trade war was dragging on the economy, employers added 3,000 factory jobs in August, less than half the expected 8,000 jobs and down from July\u2019s 4,000-job increase. Manufacturing \u201cis the sector to watch for the connection between trade uncertainty and the real economy,\u201d Richardson said.\n\nTransportation and warehousing jobs, which feel knock-on effects from trade and manufacturing, dropped by 0.5%.\n\n(Graphic: trade war link: here)\n\nRetail jobs dropped for the seventh straight month in a row, indicating that U.S. retailers could be more troubled that expected. \u201cI know we just passed Labor Day but they just continue to shed jobs like nobody\u2019s business,\u201d said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.\n\n(Graphic: retail_woes link: here)\n\n\u201cPRETTY DARN GOOD SHAPE\u201d\n\nFederal jobs rose by 34,000, boosted mostly by a 25,000 new temporary jobs related to the U.S. 2020 Census. \u201cThat is not repeatable,\u201d said Kinahan. \u201cSo that is a one-month little bump, so that gives you maybe a little bit of concern.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials said the report showed President Donald Trump\u2019s policies were a success. \u201cAmerica is working,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the White House economic advisor, told Bloomberg after the report was published. \u201cWe\u2019re in pretty darn good shape.\u201d\n\nWOMEN LEAD\n\nOne bright spot was an increase in the number of women of prime working age who either have jobs or are looking for one. Female participation drove a rebound in overall labor force participation, which increased by 0.2% in August to 63.2%. Participation by women age 25 to 54 jumped a full percentage point to 76.3%.\n\n(Graphic: Women_lead link: here)\n\n\u201cIn the last few years of the expansion, we\u2019ve seen women really lead the way when it comes to labor force participation,\u201d said Nick Bunker, an economist at the Indeed Hire Lab. Women make up a disproportionate share of workers in some sectors that are seeing strong job gains, such as health care and education, he said.\n\nMORE HOURS\n\nWhile job growth slowed, American employees worked more hours. The Labor Department said an index of hours worked across the economy rose 0.4% in August. Growth in that index, which economists treat as an early indicator of economic growth, has been cooling for much of this year.\n\nThis reading could point to slower growth, rather than a sharp turn toward economic contraction.\n\n(Graphic: agg_houres link: here)\n\nRATE CUT AHEAD Stock markets rose in early trading as the weak report made investors even more convinced that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points on at its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.\n\n\u201cThis report isn\u2019t going to change what the Fed is going to do this month,\u201d predicted Bill Merz, the head of fixed income research at U.S. Bank wealth management in Minneapolis.", "description": "U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, reflecting the U.S. trade war with China and raising expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut this month.", "authors": ["Jason Lange", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426992651&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851N4", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
