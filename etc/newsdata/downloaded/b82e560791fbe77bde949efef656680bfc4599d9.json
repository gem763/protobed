Women who exercise, don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t binge drink and stay a healthy weight after menopause have a lower risk.\n\nBreast mammography, although imperfect, has been instrumental in detecting breast cancer when it does occur. Recommendations regarding screening are controversial; the question is the age that screening should begin.\n\nThe American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends annual screening starting at age 40, while the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) believes that you should be screened every two years starting at age 50.\n\nThe American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends annual screening at age 45, with the option for women to be screened when they're 40 if they prefer. The differences reflect changing opinions on what age the benefits of screening outweigh the risks.\n\nNew to the scene is breast tomosynthesis, a 3D screening tool that received FDA approval in 2011. Research has shown better cancer detection rates with tomosynthesis, and fewer \u201cfalse alarms,\" when women with no disease are mistakenly called back for further testing.\n\nAFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nIn patients with dense breast tissue, screening ultrasounds can improve detection rates. In patients with the highest risk of developing breast cancer, screening breast MRIs, in combination with mammography, have been shown to improve survival.\n\nFactors in predicting accurate risk estimates\n\nDoctors can check a few things to estimate your risk of breast cancer. There are many genetic risk factors, but they may also check for other mutations as well. The best-known mutations are BRCA1 and BRCA2, though doctors may not routinely check for them unless someone is high risk, meaning they have a known family history of the gene mutations or have a first-degree family member with breast cancer.\n\nThese mutations are inherited, so a doctor needs to know of any family members who have suffered breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Family history is very important, as physicians may decide to screen a woman earlier if a family member was diagnosed with breast cancer at an early age.\n\nGenetic history, however, only accounts for 5 to 10 percent of all breast cancers, according to the American Cancer Society. Receiving large doses of radiation to the chest between age 10 and 30, either for treatment of lymphoma or any other reason, would be another risk factor for developing breast cancer.\n\nA look at some of the latest treatment options\n\nA diagnosis of cancer is frightening, but with advances in treatment, you and your doctor can find an ideal treatment plan. Surgeons may take out the cancer in a procedure called a lumpectomy, with plans for radiation therapy following surgery.\n\nThis technique conserves most of the breast tissue. If the cancer is more advanced, a surgeon may perform a mastectomy, where the entire breast is removed.\n\nThere are many types of breast cancer; depending on the cancer\u2019s hormone receptor status and genetic factors, different treatments may work better.\n\nAdvances in targeted therapies\n\nCancers with Estrogen Receptors (ER-positive) and Progesterone Receptors (PR-positive) may be given hormone therapy drugs to improve the outcome. Around two out of three breast cancers have at least one receptor.\n\nAnother important receptor is HER2, as this can be targeted with other medications. Cancers that don\u2019t have any of these receptors are called \u201ctriple-negative\u201d cancers and are typically more aggressive than other breast cancers.\n\nThese cancers may require more aggressive treatment, such as chemotherapy. Not only will the tumor's hormone receptor status be tested, but the rest of the genetic makeup of the cancer itself may also be tested.\n\nUsing tests such as MammaPrint or OncotypeDx, cancers can be classified into cancers that are low- or high-risk of recurrence. If you have a low genetic risk of recurrence, you may be able to avoid chemotherapy, based on recent research.\n\nOther women may avoid chemotherapy if other factors suggest a low risk of recurrence, such as small tumor size or early stage of diagnosis.\n\nBreast cancer is common, and scary, but you aren't treating it alone. With new techniques and treatments, the medical community is better equipped to cure it than ever before. Be sure to keep up with regular screenings, and let your doctor know of any new symptoms.\n\nDr. Jonathan Steinman is a physician in radiology and writer with the ABC News Medical Unit.", "description": "Here's what to know about the latest developments in breast cancer research.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/mammogram-02-gty-jc-180307_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
