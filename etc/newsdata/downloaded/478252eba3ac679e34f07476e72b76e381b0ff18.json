Chrome OS is the Google-created operating system that was originally designed to be used with a continuous internet connection.\n\nIn the first generations, the Chromebook was hobbled when it was disconnected, but things are much better now with more advanced offline capabilities.\n\nChromebooks also offer strong battery life and, mostly, are competitively priced. That\u2019s because the processors are not as powerful as on some rivals because so much of the heavy lifting is done in the cloud, on Google servers.\n\nSome of the latest Chromebooks have compatibility with Android apps as well as Chrome OS programs, adding to the machines\u2019 capabilities. This feature, and a backlit keyboard, were rare so we\u2019ve highlighted them in our reviews where relevant.\n\nIf you want the widest variety of programs or the capability to get involved in advanced video editing or other memory-hungry applications, then a Chromebook may not suit. For the rest of us, they can be just right.\n\nTesting involved challenging the laptops to basic and advanced programs and measuring performance in terms of speed and delays. How long it took for the battery life to drain was important, and the look and weight of the machines were taken into account.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The touchscreen works brilliantly with the optional extra pixelbook pen (\u00a399) so you can write on the display. The powerful processor alone would set this Chromebook apart from most rivals but there\u2019s much more to like, from the exceptionally comfortable keyboard to the inclusion of Google Assistant, which can be invoked from a dedicated key, from a tap of the pixelbook pen and by speaking Google\u2019s name.\n\nThe pixelbook has one other standout feature: as well as Chrome OS applications, it can run Android apps, as found on smartphones, as well. This adds so many apps that it comes close to rivalling the versatility of Windows and Apple machines. The hinges fold through 360 degrees so it can become a proper tablet, too. This is a real pleasure to use and a genuine competitor to high-end notebooks from rival manufacturers.\n\nBuy now\n\nDell inspiron Chromebook 14 7000: \u00a3629.99, Amazon\n\nScreen size: 14in\u200b\n\nStorage: 128GB\u200b\n\nMemory: 4GB\n\nLike the Pixelbook, this is a two-in-one, that is, you can fold the display back on itself so it works like a tablet. It looks and feels good thanks to its aluminium casing. The display is bright, vivid and high-resolution: it is sharp and colourful and the touchscreen is responsive. It also offers support for Android apps. There are other subtle features like a backlit keyboard so typing in low light isn\u2019t an issue. It\u2019s not as light as some laptops but is very well built and looks good. This Chromebook is bigger than many on the market, so suits someone who wants multiple applications open at one time.\n\nBuy now\n\nAcer Chromebook spin 11 CP311-1HN: \u00a3328.98, Amazon\n\nScreen size: 11.6in\n\nStorage: 32GB\u200b\n\nMemory: 4GB\n\nThis is a highly affordable laptop. One of the reasons is the build quality. It\u2019s constructed from plastic, though don\u2019t be put off, it\u2019s sturdy and solid. It\u2019s a strong choice if you\u2019re picking a laptop for a child, for instance. This is a laptop that\u2019s fun rather than highly specced: after all, it only has 32GB storage, but it\u2019s highly usable and looks like it will last a long time. The 11.6in display will be too small for some but is ideal if you want something completely portable.\n\nBuy now\n\nAsus Chromebook flip C434TA-A10041: \u00a3799.99, Asus\n\nScreen size: 14in\u200b\n\nStorage: 128GB\u200b\n\nMemory: 8GB\n\nAnother Chromebook with a slick aluminium element, the Asus has an attractive design and decent enough specs for the price. The \"flip\" in the title refers to the way the laptop folds back on itself. The machine is reasonably small thanks to slim bezels that maximise screen size. It\u2019s a good screen, too. The backlit keyboard is comfortable and spacious, even though the laptop is smaller than some other 14in screen machines. Battery life is also better than many Chromebooks. Compatible with Android apps from the Google play store.\n\nBuy now\n\nAcer Chromebook 14 CB514-1HT: \u00a3349.95, Acer\n\nScreen size: 14in\u200b\n\nStorage: 32GB\u200b\n\nMemory: 4GB\n\nThis is a neat Chromebook with strong build quality and battery life that lasts all day. The screen is decent, rather than outstanding and the look of the machine overall is great with an attractive aluminium chassis, though the bezels at the top and bottom of the display are pretty wide. There could be a little more travel in the keys but the keyboard and touchpad are comfortable to use. It\u2019s a mid-range Chromebook (though still reasonably priced as laptops go) which accounts for the average-quality audio. Performance is better than some thanks to a greater level of operating memory.\n\nBuy now\n\nAsus C202 11.6in Chromebook: \u00a3149, PC World\n\nScreen size: 11.6in\n\nStorage: 16GB\u200b\n\nMemory: 2GB\n\nIf you want to pay as little as possible for a laptop, it's hard to beat this model from Asus. Battery life is strong, at up to 10 hours. Though it only has 2GB of active memory, remember that providing you're connected to the internet, the Chromebook doesn\u2019t need the fastest processor or tons of RAM, so this needn't be an issue. Usefully, this laptop has a spill-proof design so it isn't defeated if you splash it but, please note, this is no match for proper waterproofing.\n\nBuy now\n\nHP Chromebook 14 ca000na: \u00a3199, HP\n\nScreen size: 14in\u200b\n\nStorage: 32GB\u200b\n\nMemory: 4GB\n\nThis model is a great balance between value and capabilities, with the 4GB of operating memory making a real difference to the usability of the laptop: it\u2019s faster than many and works well. The display is good, the keyboard is comfortable with good travel in the keys and, just as importantly, the trackpad is big and easy to use. Like many Chromebooks, this one from HP has limited storage, working on the basis that you\u2019ll be storing everything in the cloud so it needn\u2019t matter.\n\nBuy now\n\nAcer Chromebook R13 CB5-312T: \u00a3399, Amazon\n\nScreen size: 13.3in\n\nStorage: 64GB\u200b\n\nMemory: 4GB\n\nThe R13 is slim and reasonably lightweight, with a screen that rotates through 360 degrees for maximum versatility, though, as with other laptops that fold round like this, there\u2019s something strange about feeling the keys on the back of the screen when you hold it. The keys aren\u2019t as good as some here but certainly highly usable, even though like almost all the keyboards here, it\u2019s not backlit. The display looks good, and this Chromebook works very well as for video playback, though it\u2019s not especially bright. Great for web browsing, too, though not powerful enough for really advanced programs. Decent battery life makes this a good buy.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Chromebooks\n\nSince Google makes the Chrome operating software, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that the company\u2019s own hardware works so well, as it does in the case of the pixelbook. If you only need something basic, then the Asus C202 11.6 offers outstanding value. For the best of both worlds, though, the HP Chromebook 14 ca000na is the best balance of price and power.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
