It will later expand to phone apps for making calls.\n\nCurrently, if you want Siri to message or call a contact using WhatsApp or Skype, for example, you need to specifically mention those apps. Otherwise, the voice assistant defaults to Apple\u2019s iMessage service or the Phone app. However, in the future, Siri will learn which service you prefer for each contact and default to that for communications, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe report says that individual app developers will need to update their apps to take advantage of the new functionality.\n\nEU investigators are currently looking into a complaint made by Spotify\n\nNews of the Siri tweaks comes as Bloomberg published a separate piece showing the advantage Apple\u2019s apps gain over competitors by being the preinstalled defaults on Apple devices. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s starting to attract the attention of regulators. Back in May, there were reports that the EU was preparing to launch an antitrust investigation after Spotify complained that Apple uses its App Store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice. Apple is facing similar regulatory scrutiny in the US.\n\nApple is already taking steps to allow Siri to work better with third-party music apps. The latest beta version of Spotify includes the ability to play songs, albums, and playlists from Siri, although you\u2019ll have to specifically ask for Spotify. Otherwise, it defaults to Apple Music.\n\nResponding to Bloomberg\u2019s report, an Apple spokesperson said that the company includes its own apps on its phones \u201cto provide customers with a great experience right out of the box.\u201d It added that in the \u201cfew categories\u201d where it produces its own app, \u201cwe have many successful competitors.\u201d", "description": "Apple is preparing to allow Siri to use third-party messaging and calling apps by default.
