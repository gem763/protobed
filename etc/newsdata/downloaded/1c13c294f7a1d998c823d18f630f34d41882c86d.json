Every position group then had a \u201cdevelopmental period\u201d after the official end of practice.\n\nAD\n\nThose were just a few of the tweaks Callahan installed in his first practice at the helm of the 0-5 Redskins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just switching up, basically tweaking the format of practice,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cJust really kind of focused on team. \u2026 What I did this morning was explain everything to them, what we\u2019re going to do, how we\u2019re going to do it, what the expectations were, what the challenges are, and they seemed receptive to it. I think they just want to get back to playing good, solid, foundational, fundamental football, and that gives us a chance.\"\n\nAD\n\nThe differences Callahan plans to bring to the job were apparent throughout the afternoon. The interim coach announced that he would no longer detail injury issues the way Gruden did after every practice, leaving the daily injury report to speak for itself.\n\nAD\n\nCallahan also said he would not announce a starting quarterback until Friday, although he did say that all three of the team\u2019s passers \u2014 Case Keenum, Colt McCoy and Dwayne Haskins \u2014 received some first-team reps.\n\nEven the pre-practice stretches were different, with the captains in front and facing the team, as opposed to lining up with everyone else. Callahan said he wants the captains to take a bigger leadership role.\n\nOther changes included a gantlet-style ball-security drill for the offense and the entire team huddling together after stretches. Players described the practice as having more tempo with an emphasis on attention to detail.\n\nAD\n\nWednesday marked the first open locker room period since Gruden\u2019s firing, but there wasn\u2019t a noticeable difference in mood or attitude among the players. They were respectful of Gruden and took responsibility for the team\u2019s shortcomings but also preached the need to move on under their interim coach.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis thing is not going to get fixed in one day,\u201d offensive lineman Morgan Moses said. \u201cWe have to come together because an 0-5 start for this franchise is embarrassing, man.\u201d\n\nLandon Collins sat at his locker getting dressed, shook his head and expressed zero interest in talking about the Redskins\u2019 coaching change. The three-time Pro Bowl safety has seen this before, when his New York Giants team made a midseason switch from Ben McAdoo to Steve Spagnuolo in 2017, and the Giants spiraled to a 3-13 finish. Collins signed an $84 million deal with the Redskins during free agency this year, and this isn\u2019t exactly what he signed up for.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something you want to go through,\u201d Collins said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay positive. You\u2019ve got to keep your guys into it as much as you can. Whoever becomes the coach has to have the respect of the guys and stuff like that. \u2026 I\u2019m just taking it day-by-day, bro. Coming in to do my work, do my job to the best of my ability to get these guys right on defense as much as I can.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhereas Collins signed with Washington by choice, Keenum arrived via trade from the Denver Broncos in March. He worked closely with Gruden to learn the offense, which may change slightly under Callahan, who has expressed that he wants to renew the team\u2019s dedication to the running game. The coaching change may ultimately work in Keenum\u2019s favor, however, considering that McCoy was a favorite of Gruden\u2019s from their many seasons together. Keenum started the first four games before being benched for Haskins in a Week 4 loss to the Giants. McCoy started last week against New England.\n\n\u201cAs far as it being awkward, it\u2019s a tough business,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cFootball is a great game, but it\u2019s a tough business. There\u2019s a lot of hard days. I\u2019ve had a lot more hard days than I\u2019ve had great days. But that\u2019s what makes those great days really, really great. And I think we have some great days ahead of us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKeenum (foot) was a full participant in practice and said he\u2019s feeling better than he has the past two weeks. Tackle Donald Penn (hamstring), guard Wes Martin (chest), tight end Jordan Reed (concussion) and linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons (hamstring) were out Wednesday. Tight end Vernon Davis (concussion), tackle Morgan Moses (shoulder) and guard Brandon Scherff (ankle) were limited.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "\"I think they just want to get back to playing good, solid, foundational, fundamental football,\" said Washington's interim head coach, who wouldn't name a starting quarterback for Sunday's game versus Miami.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PB8QsPT9pU7J1rE4sGne06jNyt8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z3DXU3XKYMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
