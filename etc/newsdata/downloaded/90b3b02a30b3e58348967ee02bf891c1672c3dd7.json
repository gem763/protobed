Let's see what the charts look like ahead of the numbers.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of UNH, below, we can see a low in April and a successful retest in late August/early September. It is early in the process but we could be looking at a double bottom pattern in the weeks ahead. Prices need to rally above the July peak to complete the pattern. The turnaround will take time as prices are below the declining 50-day and 200-day moving average lines.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been stable since the April low and a few up days with heavy volume should be able to turn the OBV line positive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator made a twin bottom in September and October giving us two cover shorts buy signals. An outright go long signal would need to cross the zero line and that is not all that far away.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of UNH, below, we can see the past three years of price action on UNH. In prior reviews I have described the action as a large potential top formation but support continues to materialize around $210 and the indicators are starting to shift from down to up.\n\nPrices are still below the declining 40-week moving average line but it won't take too much of a rally to close back above this indicator.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is holding around its March low and starting to turn to the upside telling us that buyers are becoming more aggressive.\n\nThe weekly MACD oscillator has begun to narrow below the zero line. A crossover to the upside will be a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of UNH, below, we adjusted the filter to only look at $5 price reversals and the result is a chart that turns bullish on a trade at $268 with a long-term price target of $490.\n\nBottom line strategy: Traders and investors can probe the long side of UNH at current levels provided they risk a move below $210. If we are indeed seeing a double bottom being hammered out then this is a good place to get involved.", "description": "UNH reports earnings on Tuesday....UNH", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Unitedhealth Group Is Looking Stronger As Support Has Held", "Unh Reports Earnings On Tuesday.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/unitedhealthgroupsign-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
