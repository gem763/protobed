But, as ever, New Zealand remain the bookies' favourites, but will it be captain Kieran Reid making it three victories in a row for the All Blacks on Saturday November 2?\n\nNew Zealand 6/4\n\nDespite a more temperate year by their own lofty standards, New Zealand still possess ample class, and count some of the world's very best performers among their squad.
