Taking his place was Eddie Jones, a professional rugby coach from Burnie, Tasmania.\n\nHe has beaten the All Blacks more times than any other \u2014 he has beaten them in a Rugby World Cup semi-final before, too, and then lost. So he wasn't much up for jokes, or mischief.\n\nAnd maybe that will change. Maybe, now Jones knows his opponents, he will attempt a few shots in the coming week - in the immediate aftermath of what might be the most magnificent victory in English rugby history, Jones was playing it straight, playing it like a coach whose team are one victory from the greatest glory.\n\nManu Tuilagi got England off to the perfect start with a try within the opening two minutes\n\nEddie Jones masterminded the RWC semi-final victory against New Zealand, as he did in 2003\n\n'It's just another week, mate,' he said, although quite plainly it is not. 'The players are at the end of seven weeks, so recovery is very important, physical and mental. The mind-set you create now is important, too, and it's about not inventing shadows. Everywhere you look there are shadows. You've got to make sure you're looking at the right shadows.'\n\nThat is what Jones did for New Zealand, he invented shadows. Not the vague spying accusation that fooled no-one, or even the talk of pressure, because any team at the top live with that.\n\nJones cast a shadow that fell across the All Blacks the moment the game started. Fanning out to outflank the haka was a symbolic gesture, but it wouldn't have amounted to anything had England not started so furiously.\n\nThat was Jones' masterstroke, perfectly executed by his players, led by Owen Farrell. This was rugby's equivalent of shock and awe. Jones loves to talk up brutality as an aim and sometimes it feels jarring. We think of brutality as violence. Jones doesn't. This is what he meant by brutality. The game pressure England placed on New Zealand instantly.\n\n'There's only one rule in street and bar fights,' wrote Martin Amis, as John Self, the would-be film producer in his novel, Money, 'maximum violence, instantly. Don't pussyfoot, don't wait for the war to escalate. Nuke them, right off. Hit them with everything, milk bottle, car tool, clenched keys or coins.\n\n'The first blow has to give everything. If he takes it and you go down, then you get all he has to mete out anyway. The worst, the most extreme violence \u2014 at once. Extremity is the only element of surprise. Hit them with everything. No quarter.'\n\nAnd that was England's tactical victory over the All Blacks. Maximum violence, as soon as possible. The first try is the fastest New Zealand have ever conceded at a World Cup, their ad hoc team meeting midway through the first half seemed pretty unique, too.\n\nHere was the greatest team rugby had ever seen desperately trying to get their game together, in full public view, wondering what had hit them and where they could go from here. England's physicality was immense. Maro Itoje, a deserved man of the match, won turnover ball just about every time he was first to the breakdown.\n\nMaro Itoje was player of the match after a sensational performance, with and without the ball\n\nThe wonderfully named Kamikaze Kids, England flankers Sam Underhill and Tom Curry \u2014 who were 11 and nine when New Zealand last lost a World Cup game \u2014 made mighty hits. To underline how perfectly Jones managed his selections, George Ford and Owen Farrell made the most tackles of any players in the England team.\n\nThere is a point in the fifth set of the 2012 US Open final when it becomes clear Novak Djokovic, physically, cannot take any more \u2014 that Andy Murray has worn him down to a state of near exhaustion. Djokovic, the player who has taken tennis to the extremes of athletic achievement, is done.\n\nThe opening 97 seconds of the match gave England the perfect platform for Saturday's semi-final victory\n\nIt has taken his last reserves of strength to come back from two sets down, but he has no more. Murray serves out to win the final set 6-2, his first Grand Slam victory.\n\nLike Djokovic, New Zealand were still going at the end in Yokohama, but on memory.\n\n'You can win the match, but you can never beat them,' said Jones, noting that the spirit remained. Yet that wasn't how it looked. The All Blacks were still trying to do All Black things, but without the same focus. They were running into blind alleys, making so many mistakes. Not sloppy so much as rattled. For that was England's triumph, too.\n\nThey didn't catch New Zealand on a bad day. Had they not reached this level of performance it is quite possible they would have lost, as so many have since the All Blacks last tasted defeat at a World Cup, in 2007.\n\nNobody in the vanquished camp suggested New Zealand hadn't turned up. Steve Hansen, the coach, may even have violated the All Blacks famed 'no d***heads' policy by appearing to ask outside a journalist who intimated as much.\n\nInstead, New Zealand credited England with making them second best. Repaying the compliment, perhaps, Jones continued to emphasise the toil that had gone into beating them.\n\n'As I said, we had two-and-a-half years to prepare for this game,' he explained. 'The players weren't consciously preparing for it, but subconsciously we were garnering a game to play against New Zealand. That's World Cup coaching.\n\n'It was similar to Japan in 2015. The crux game was playing South Africa. We had to win that game, because then we would have a successful World Cup. For a team like England, who are top-four ranked, your crux game is going to be the semi-final. All the top teams prepare for the semi-final.'\n\nEddie Jones was Japan's coach for the greatest Rugby World Cup upset of all time in 2015\n\nNow he was talking like the man the RFU wish to retain.\n\nHe wasn't engaged because he gives a good press conference, a smart analogy, a funny line. This is one of coaching's smartest minds, a man not scared to surround himself with front-line coaches of substance and stature, like John Mitchell.\n\nIn a strange way, it almost made a change from the true persona of the man who had marshalled these players.\n\nWhatever impish air Jones might exude, the real coach could be glimpsed as the second half was due to start and he stood on the touchline re-emphasising key points to his bench.\n\n'They were going to be our most important players,' he said. 'We selected the finishing team first. Their role was always going to be to win the game and they did that brilliantly.\n\n'The last 20 minutes is always when you win or lose a Test against New Zealand, so the points were general about what we had to do in the forwards and the backs.\n\nEngland were the dominant side from the line-out, despite New Zealand's walk-in try\n\n'Nothing too complicated. We wanted a set-piece focus. We thought in the last 20 minutes the set-piece would be more important than it was at first, so we picked our strongest set-piece finishers.\n\n'Look, it's a dream for a coach because it's how you want the team to play. You can create an environment at the start, but then it comes down to leadership on the field and I couldn't be more effusive in my praise for the leadership team out there. They were outstanding, the way they kept driving the team forward.\n\n'A Test match against New Zealand is like the start of a Grand Prix. You've got to be on your mark ready to go because if you're not, you get left behind and you can never find your way back to the top of the pack.\n\n'We had to come out of the blocks hard and establish some physical and mental ascendancy early. You don't win the game there but it puts you in a good position.'\n\nThe difficulty from here, and Jones will know it, is stopping this from becoming England's World Cup final. In coaching terms, that was Jurgen Klopp's great achievement with Liverpool in the summer \u2014 not allowing the 4-0 win over Barcelona to become the pinnacle.\n\nWho can't get motivated for a final? Yes, but there are finals and finals. Sometimes the semi-final is the harder game, sometimes it feels like the summit.\n\nWhat was Liverpool's greater challenge \u2014 coming back from 3-0 down against Barcelona, or beating a Tottenham side they had already outstripped by 26 points in the league?\n\nSo while many are calling this England's greatest performance since 2003 in Sydney, in many ways it is better. Yes, the prize back then was huge but England, not Australia, were the world's No 1 team. They had the game won and the late Jonny Wilkinson drama came only because they let a 14-5 half-time lead slip.\n\nThis is what Jones must guard against, hence the absence of euphoria.\n\nJonny Wilkinson won the World Cup for England in 2003 with a dramatic extra-time drop-goal\n\nJones insisted post-match that it was just another week ahead of Saturday's World Cup final\n\n'You'll have people on the street patting you on the back and telling you how good you've been,' said Jones, 'You've got to work hard to keep yourself focused. It's a mind-set this week.\n\n'All we've done is give ourselves another week in the competition. We want to be the best in the world and we're not. So we're not going to be satisfied until that happens. It's a good performance but we've got to play better next week.'\n\nAnd there he was, Eddie Jones \u2014 World Cup finalist, sober, serious, professional rugby coach.
