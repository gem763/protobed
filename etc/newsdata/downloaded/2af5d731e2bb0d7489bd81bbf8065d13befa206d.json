Dobrik, who is the creative mind behind much of the partnership, has filmed 30-plus videos sponsored by SeatGeek for his YouTube channel. These videos have generated a total 200 million views, and built as much search interest as more mainstream partnerships \u2014 like Chrissy Teigen and Target, or Ninja and Red Bull \u2014 according to Google Trends data. The Dobrik partnership has led to over 25,000 Twitter mentions, fan videos with 1 million views, and shout-outs from other influencers.\n\n\"The reason that people support the partnership is because they are supporting us, supporting David,\" Borthwick said. Many of Dobrik's SeatGeek videos show him using the brand's money to surprise friends, with gifts like a new Tesla, or by paying off their college tuition.\n\nBorthwick said investing in influencers like Dobrik has helped the brand compete with rivals like Ticketmaster and StubHub. And for SeatGeek, creating an effective influencer marketing partnership means taking a backseat and trusting the influencer with the creative direction.\n\n'Let your guard down' and trust the influencer to take creative control\n\n\"If you let your guard down and really lean into the joke of the entire thing, you can reach a level where the audience really celebrates you and you don't feel like some stuffy brand,\" Borthwick said. \"They view you as a content creator yourself, who is a part of this weird, die-hard loyal community of fans.\"\n\nSeatGeek has \"leaned into\" some of the jokes between the company and Dobrik, from Borthwick jokingly calling the company a \"car dealership\" while on the phone with Dobrik in the recent video, to the brand reacting on Twitter to Dobrik's sponsored post with another company.\n\n\"What did we do wrong...\" SeatGeek wrote sharing the tweet, later adding: \"PLEASE WE HAVE A FAMILY!\"\n\n\"I think a lot of brands make the mistake of sending over these incredibly complex and restrictive creative briefs,\" Borthwick said. \"Ultimately, those produce bad influencer marketing.\"\n\nBy taking a backseat and allowing the influencer to drive the direction of the sponsorship, brands can utilize the unique creator-fan relationship that comes with working with a popular influencer, Borthwick said.\n\nRead more about SeatGeek's partnership with David Dobrik, here:", "description": "Ian Borthwick, SeatGeek's director of influencer marketing, shares his tips for a successful campaign and examples of what brands should avoid.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d829d452e22af0a0c26bfb7-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
