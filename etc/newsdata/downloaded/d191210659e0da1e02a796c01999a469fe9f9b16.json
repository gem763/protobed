The AEMC also proposed reforms last month to integrate small-scale rooftop solar and batteries better into the distribution network.\n\n\"We need to manage the transformation of the power system in ways that stop lower-cost generators being cut off congested networks. That can lead to unnecessary costs for consumers,\u201d Mr Pierce said.\n\n\"Regardless of what happens in the future, these reforms need to be in place so new generation can have access to the grid in the cheapest way possible.\"\n\nThe proposed changes are intended to complement the long-term blueprint for the transmission grid, the Integrated System Plan. While the ISP identifies what investment is needed in the grid, the latest recommendations reduce the risk of new investments for consumers, generators, network owners and financiers.\n\nWriting in The Australian Financial Review on Monday, Mr Pierce noted that some 50 gigawatts of generation, roughly equivalent to the current size of the National Electricity Market, is likely to be connected into the grid over the next decade, requiring significant investment in transmission to get the benefit of it.\n\nAt the same time, prices have to be affordable for consumers, and that involves the costs of transmission and distribution as well as generation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the moment, a lack of coordination between generation and transmission investment decisions is slowing down the integration of new renewable power sources and limiting the ability of the Australian Energy Market Operator to dispatch the lowest cost generation to consumers. AEMO is also having to increase the use of temporary fixes to keep the lights on.\n\nAEMO chief Audrey Zibelman is having to intervene in the market increasingly often to keep the system stable. Australian Financial Review\n\n\"It is time for generators, especially innovative generators, to be rewarded for locating where their energy has the most value to those who need it,\" Mr Pierce wrote.\n\n\"And when congestion occurs, instead of complaining about the inability to connect, generators would be in a position to do something about it.\"\n\nThe package of proposed reforms includes additional measures intended to make renewable energy zones, designated areas of concentrated wind and solar resources, happen faster.\n\nSubmissions on the proposals in the AEMC's Coordination of Generation and Transmission Investment program, are due by November 8, with a final decision by the end of the year. If energy ministers agree, the measures could be implemented without delaying the timing of new generator connections, the AEMC said.", "description": "Wind and solar farm developers would have to pay some of the cost of connecting into the transmission grid and buy rights to get more control to use the network under a proposed radical overhaul.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c6b46aa2d38c7f995e90df7b8fa6106588f9e426", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
