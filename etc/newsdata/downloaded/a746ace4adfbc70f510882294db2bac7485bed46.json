Trumps team up on Biden at vitriolic Minneapolis rally", "language": "en", "text": "Donald and Eric Trump repeat claims of improper behaviour by Joe Biden\u2019s son in sign of how 2020 campaign will be fought\n\nDonald Trump sought to weaponise Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry to his electoral advantage on Thursday at a typically crude-but-effective rally in which he declared Joe Biden \u201cwas only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass\u201d.\n\nIn his first campaign stop since the inquiry was announced, the US president and a 20,000-capacity crowd staged a formidable show of defiance at a basketball arena in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Trump mesmerised his fans for 102 minutes with a verbal cannon of conspiracy theories, blatant falsehoods, profane insults and anti-refugee bigotry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m energised,\u201d he boasted, pointing his finger at the media, \u201cbecause we\u2019re draining the swamp\u201d.\n\nThere was clapping, cheering and chanting of \u201cdrain the swamp!\u201d from the crowd, many wearing \u201cMake America great again\u201d hats and sweaters. Trump went on: \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country.\u201d\n\nUS warns Turkey of red lines as Syria offensive death toll mounts Read more\n\nBut the raucous event took place in a congressional district that Trump lost to Hillary Clinton by 55 percentage points in 2016 and that is represented by Ilhan Omar, a Muslim, Somali-born US congresswoman. Several protesters interrupted the president\u2019s flow and demonstrators marched outside, demanding his removal from office. There were reports of police shooting pepper spray and making arrests when skirmishes broke out in Minneapolis on Thursday night.\n\nTrump and his allies showed their willingness to fight dirty every bit as much as they did against Clinton in 2016. Among the warm-up acts, his son Eric, who pushed a baseless allegation that former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, \u201cembezzled a lot of money\u201d. He added: \u201cMaybe \u2018Lock her up\u2019 goes to \u2018Lock him up\u2019, I don\u2019t know.\u201d The crowd duly shouted: \u201cLock him up! Lock him up!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters demonstrate outside the Target Center after the Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Minneapolis.

Facing an impeachment inquiry triggered by his call for Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, he cast himself \u2013 and by extension his supporters \u2013 as victims of the Washington ruling class. Just as he used Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation to conjure fears of a deep state conspiracy, so he now lunged at impeachment as a convenient tool to further his narrative and demonise his opponents.\n\nDemocrats and their \u201cpartner\u201d the media, he claimed, are conspiring to stage a \u201ccoup\u201d to overturn the 2016 election result. \u201cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey want to erase your voice, and they want to erase your future. But they will fail because in America the people rule again.\u201d\n\nHe again defended his July conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as \u201ca totally appropriate, casual, beautiful, accurate phone call\u201d and accused \u201ccrooked\u201d Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, of making up a \u201cfake conversation that never happened\u201d, later endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Trump claimed to have wrong-footed them by releasing a transcript of the call.\n\n\u201cThese people are sick,\u201d he said, bristling with indignation. \u201cDemocrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them.\u201d\n\nThe president showed how he intends to merge impeachment with the 2020 election campaign so they become indistinguishable in the minds of his voters. He launched a ferocious attack on Biden and Hunter, whom he and his allies have accused, without evidence, of illegally profiting off his father\u2019s vice-presidency.\n\nUsing the \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d nickname, Trump claimed Biden is \u201ctotally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp, for many years\u201d. He said the vice president was put in charge of Ukraine policy and mocked the media\u2019s use of the term \u201cunsubstantiated charges\u201d. He joked about creating a t-shirt with the logo: \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\nTrump went on, mockingly: \u201cHunter, you\u2019re a loser. Why did you get $1.5bn, Hunter? And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nThe crowd erupted in delight, relishing Trump\u2019s vulgar, taboo-busting audacity \u2013 a key characteristic of his political rise. Describing trade deals with China, he added: \u201cThe Bidens got rich, and that is substantiated, while America got robbed. That\u2019s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America.\u201d\n\nWhile Hunter Biden did have business interest overseas while he father was in office, there is no evidence of misconduct.\n\nThe impeachment saga appeared to have fired Trump up. \u201cIsn\u2019t it much better when I go off script?\u201d he asked in rollicking fashion. There were more insults to come. Pelosi, he said, is \u201ceither really stupid or she\u2019s really lost it or maybe there\u2019s a certain dishonesty there\u201d.\n\nHe branded Omar an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist\u201d, ran through some of her past antisemitic remarks (for which she later apologised) and allegations by some conservative media that Omar married her brother to commit immigration fraud \u2013 a claim she has called \u201cdisgusting lies\u201d. Trump said: \u201cShe is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that I\u2019m going to win and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months.\u201d\n\nThere was no repeat of the \u201cSend her back!\u201d cries heard at a rally this summer in North Carolina. But Trump said Minnesota, home to the biggest Somali population in the US, allowed refugees in without considering the impact on schools, the community and taxpayers.\n\n\u201cI have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%,\u201d he boasted to the overwhelming white crowd, warning that Democrats would \u201copen the floodgates\u201d.\n\nOmar responded in a tweet: \u201cAt his rally just now, Trump called me an \u2018America-hating socialist\u2019 and a \u2018disgrace\u2019. He shouted xenophobic conspiracy theories about me. He scolded my district for voting for me. His hate is no match for our movement. Stand with me by donating now.\u201d\n\nFarhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, said: \u201cBy now, it is painfully clear that President Trump embraces hate and intends to resort to anti-Muslim bigotry to distract voters. Yet, for the safety of American Muslims in Minnesota and across the nation, I urge him to stop engaging in hateful smears.\u201d\n\nBefore a sympathetic audience, the president also shrugged off bipartisan criticism of his decision to abandon the US\u2019s Kurdish allies against Isis to an attack by Turkey. \u201cWe could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that. Let\u2019s mediate a deal.\u201d The crowd chanted \u201cBring them home!\u201d about US troops.\n\nMeanwhile, the estate of Minneapolis-born singer Prince is objecting to Trump\u2019s use of his song \u201cPurple Rain\u201d before the rally got under way. The estate released a statement after the rally saying it \u201cwill never give permission to President Trump to use Prince\u2019s songs\u201d. The campaign had confirmed a year ago that it would not use Prince\u2019s music, it added.", "description": "Donald and Eric Trump repeat claims of improper behaviour by Joe Biden\u2019s son in sign of how 2020 campaign will be fought", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/237ea17f9780494d285616301e075bd9debed3af/230_88_3555_2133/master/3555.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=164f110ed9cae553c793e84e26f69eaf", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
