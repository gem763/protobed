Though it also found some airport performance indicators, such as high international charges, operating costs, and profits, were causes to remain vigilant.\n\n\"The current approach to airport regulation benefits passengers and the community and remains fit for purpose at this time,\" the Productivity Commission said.\n\nYet, Mr Samuel \u2013 who was the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission between 2003 and 2011 \u2013 said this was not the case.\n\n\"To say that these monopolies don't exercise market power ignores the simple economic reality,\" he said. \"Every airport in Australia is a monopoly.\"\n\nMr Samuel was also highly critical of the Productivity Commission's decision to dump demands for an airport arbitration regime to solve negotiable disagreements.\n\nHe said, as it stands, airlines have little negotiating power with airports when it comes to pricing and contracts.\n\n\"What are airlines going to do if they don't land at Perth Airport because of a dispute? Drop your passengers off at Adelaide and tell them to take the train across the Nullarbor?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And if Qantas doesn't land at Perth, you can bet that Virgin will.\"\n\nMr Samuel said A4NZ \u2013 the airline industry's primary lobby group \u2013 would engage with the government to ensure that it does not support the report.\n\nAnd he said that without a commercial arbitration regime for airlines and other business interacting with airports, customers would lose out in every part of their travel.\n\n\"Customers will continue to be ripped off in every aspect of their travel when using airports [if the government accepts the report].\"\n\n\"They'll be ripped off on the car parking. They'll be ripped off on taxi surcharges. They'll be ripped off in the cost of their bottle of water and sandwich at the airport,\" he said.", "description": "A tooth and nail fight is brewing between airlines and airports as the government considers its response to a report into airport regulation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4182%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5cd7263a9761d167ade1765a637e90aa3f2427a9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
