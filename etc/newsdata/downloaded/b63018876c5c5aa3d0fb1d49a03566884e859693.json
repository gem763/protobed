The spirit of this is very, very clear and we actually offered this to Theresa May. We said that we don\u2019t think your deal is very good, but if it\u2019s up against the safeguard of being able to remain, then we will allow it to proceed in that way.\u201d\n\nHe also acknowledged that a referendum would require \u201cdetailed legislation\u201d and that it would probably take up to 22 weeks to arrange.\n\nBut he said: \u201cThis is such a fundamental question that we have to press this point about the referendum. The position we\u2019ve adopted is that whatever the outcome \u2013 whether it\u2019s Boris Johnson\u2019s bad deal or a better one which could be secured, it\u2019s got to go to a referendum up against Remain.\u201d\n\nForeign secretary Dominic Raab said Labour's position was \"extraordinary\".\n\nHe told Marr: \"The Labour Party stood on a manifesto - just as we did - to give effect to the referendum in 2016. They are now clearly planning to reverse that and that's a breach of faith with the voters. Many of your viewers at home will be astonished. We've actually secured a deal with the EU. A lot of people said the Prime Minister couldn't do that. He's got that deal. We seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons.\n\n\"Why hasn't parliament pushed this through? That's what we're going to do next week.\"", "description": "Labour will whip its MPs to back a second referendum on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal during the passage of ratification legislation through parliament, shadow cabinet minister Sir Keir Starmer has said.
