Zero. No misconduct. No quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nHannity said the \u201conly favor Trump requested\u201d in the conversation was an inquiry into what The Associated Press has called a \u201clong-discredited conspiracy theory\u201d about Democratic National Committee election hacking in 2016. The U.S. intelligence community has blamed Russia for hacking DNC servers in a bid to help elect Trump, but Trump \u2015 and apparently Hannity \u2015 are pushing a baseless conspiracy theory that the \u201cdeep state\u201d framed Russia in the plot.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, the president of the United States has a sworn duty, a constitutional duty, to investigate crimes,\u201d Hannity, an ardent Trump chum, said on his show. \u201cThe United States has a treaty with Ukraine, and several other countries like Australia, Italy, and Great Britain that requires cooperation in criminal investigations, and that\u2019s not all.\u201d\n\nThe pundit quoted the Constitution and continued to push unfounded claims that Biden urged the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor in 2016 to further the business interests of his son there. He also resurrected Trump\u2019s disproven claim that Hunter Biden accompanied the then-vice president on a 2013 trip to China to get rich in a fishy equity deal.\n\nAnd, of course, what would a Fox News commentary be without invoking \u201cdeep state bureaucrats\u201d who are really stirring up the trouble.", "description": "The Fox News personality cited Trump's mention of a long-discredited claim to make his point.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9468ed2200005200dc3a77.png?cache=nbdnij4wcn&ops=1778_1000"}
