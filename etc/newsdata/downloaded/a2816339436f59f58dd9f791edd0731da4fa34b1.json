And @crimebusterslug said that 'it's just a bloody cheese sandwich with posh pickle,' adding: 'That's no mince pie!'\n\nA pro-EU account suggested that even a country which backed Brexit in the 2016 Referendum wouldn't be 'daft enough to like this'.\n\nOne reviewer has dismissed it as a having a 'crayon-like quality' and as simply being a 'cheese and pickle roll, jazzed up for the festive season'. Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield tried out the sandwich on ITV's This Morning today, with their lukewarm conclusion was that they didn't mind it.\n\nHolly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield tuck into the festive treat on This Morning today\n\nJosh Barry wrote at inews: 'After the first bite, the flavour is relatively inoffensive, but then a waxiness arrives, followed by a raisin-born acridity, and all of a sudden it is as if you are biting into one of those unsold cinnamon candles you find in Debenhams deep into January, its red paper wrapping tired and loose, its tangle of wire stars long past twinkling.'\n\nThis sandwich joins the supermarkets\u2019 recently launched Christmas range, which also includes stuffing mince pies and Christmas tree crisps. Making a return is the Yorkshire pudding wrap, which was first launched last year.\n\nOther retailers are getting in on the act, with Sainsbury's selling a 'Christmas market' sandwich comprised of ham hock, pickles, sauerkraut and beer mayonnaise for \u00a33.\n\nTesco is promoting a Yorkshire pudding wrap containing turkey along with sage and onion stuffing.\n\nMeanwhile, Asda's bubble and squeak sandwich has vegetable fritters, sage and onion infused bread and spiced chutney.", "description": "Morrisons has created a mince pie sandwich that one taster has described as tasting like crayon as others dismissed as too 'daft' for anyone in the UK to pay \u00a33 for.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/11/20321366-0-image-a-25_1572347423182.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
