I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine,\" Vindman said in his prepared statement.\n\nHe voiced similar concerns to the NSC's lead counsel after a meeting on July 10, his prepared remarks say, as did Fiona Hill, a former NSC adviser on Russia who has testified to impeachment investigators.\n\nAt that meeting, Vindman said the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told Ukrainian officials that they needed to \"deliver specific investigations in order to secure a meeting with the President,\" at which point National Security Advisor John Bolton cut the meeting short.\n\nAfter the meeting, according to Vindman's prepared remarks, Sondland said it was important that the Ukrainian investigations center on the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company whose board included Biden's son Hunter.\n\nThe president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and others have made discredited allegations that when Biden was vice president, he had a prosecutor fired to halt an investigation into Burisma.\n\nBoth Vindman and Hill told Sondland his statements in the meeting were \"inappropriate,\" according to Vindman's prepared remarks.\n\nVindman's testimony is at odds with that of Sondland, who spoke to congressional investigators in closed hearings this month. Sondland told them he did not understand \"until much later\" that Burisma was connected to the Bidens.\n\nSondland said in his opening statement to them that he did not recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nVindman could be an important witness in the probe. His statement notes his two decades in the Army, including combat in Iraq, where he was wounded.\n\n\"I am a patriot and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective or party or politics,\" Vindman says.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Karen Freifeld in Washington; Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle, Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan; Writing by Makini Brice.
