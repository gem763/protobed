We offer practical advice and examples of how to do it right.

And it's been a fair dinkum effort,\" Morrison said\n\nIt is however, unknown when the government will provide a response to the final report.\n\nThe submission of the final report follows on from findings of the review that were released in March. It underscored that moving the APS to a more common way of operating -- a \"stable spine of common digital platforms\" -- would facilitate the change needed where collaboration and digital capability within the APS, along with the introduction of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) for service delivery are concerned.\n\nThe APS comprises of 18 departments of state, more than 100 agencies and authorities, and over 150,000 employees. Over 62% of the workforce is located outside Canberra.\n\nThere are currently over 170 bespoke IT systems being separately managed and maintained across the APS to deliver corporate services. There is also in excess of 200 bespoke business processes across government agencies with little coordination.\n\nSee also: Digital transformation: A cheat sheet (TechRepublic)\n\nThodey had previously said for the APS to be capable of delivering on the expectations of the future, public-private partnerships -- as well as inter-government collaboration -- will be key.\n\nAt the time, he noted technology could be the enabler and driver of the future of the public service.\n\n\"Digital comes with risks and I have always argued we need to look closely at them, talk about them openly and see what we can do to manage them better,\" he said.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The final report of the review into the public service has been submitted to the Australian government.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/12/3ca38526-b76c-4e48-92ab-f9ed823a2c51/thumbnail/770x578/7e5037f741f13c3ea76b11f512c579f5/istock-1072111648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
