Should I just shut up and take what I\u2019m given?\n\nI spend every working day in a cubicle in a bland office. My job is fairly solitary. I have tried to organise events to make work more fun, to develop camaraderie with colleagues. They don\u2019t appreciate it and my boss is patronising. If he had his way, I would smile, say nothing and accept what I am given. It has been 15 years now \u2013 same position, same cubicle. New people have been hired and given better titles and nicer offices. Not me. I have asked for more, and been told \u201cno\u201d with no real explanation. Is this all I should expect from my workplace?\n\n\u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
