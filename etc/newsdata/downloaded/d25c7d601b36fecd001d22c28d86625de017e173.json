REUTERS/Mike Hutchings\n\nFrancis addressed President Filipe Nyusi of the ruling Frelimo party and leaders of the Renamo opposition at the colonial-style presidential palace, where peacocks roamed lush gardens in contrast to bustling streets outside.\n\nThe two sides in the former Portuguese colony fought a 15-year civil war that ended in 1992 and killed about a million people. But only last month did they sign a permanent ceasefire.\n\n\u201cIn the course of these years, you have come to realize how the pursuit of lasting peace \u2013 a mission incumbent upon all \u2013 calls for strenuous, constant and unremitting effort. For peace is like a delicate flower, struggling to blossom on the stony ground of violence,\u201d the pope told them.\n\nSome fear that as the country of 28 million people approaches new elections scheduled for next month, violence could break out, particularly in rural areas where the former rebels have more sway.\n\nOssufo Momade, leader of Renamo, was in the audience for the papal address and received a round of applause when the president mentioned him.\n\nIn his address to the pope, the president vowed to help build a nation \u201cwhere non-violence becomes a culture lived by all, where politics is practiced through the force of argument and not the force of arms.\u201d\n\nBut Francis said if they wanted lasing peace, leaders had to discourage any form of fanaticism and exaltation and strive to improve conditions and opportunities for the marginalized.\n\n\u201cWithout equal opportunities, the different forms of aggression and conflict will find a fertile terrain for growth and eventually explode,\u201d said the pope, who arrived in Mozambique on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cGOOD DAY FOR PEACE\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP), 80% of Mozambique\u2019s population cannot afford the minimum costs for an adequate diet\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a good day for peace and reconciliation,\u201d said Myrta Kaulard, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Mozambique. \u201cFor good elections you need peace. For development you need peace.\u201d\n\nKaulard, who attended the meeting, said Francis\u2019 message would give a \u201cpositive boost,\u201d but so would his mere presence, noting the last time Mozambique was in the spotlight was for cyclones that killed more that a thousand people in March.\n\nFrancis also touched on environmental problems, another big theme of the trip that will take him on to Madagascar and Mauritius.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nHe said Mozambicans should be vigilant against pillaging and unethical exploitation of natural resources \u201cdriven by a greed generally not cultivated even by the inhabitants of these lands, nor motivated by the common good of your people\u201d.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Mozambique has lost 8 million hectares of forest, about the size of Portugal, since the 1970s.\n\nAs Asian supplies of valuable hardwoods like rosewood used to make luxury furniture have been depleted, Chinese importers have shifted to Africa. Mozambique is currently the 10th largest supplier of rosewood to China, according to Chinese customs data cited by U.S.-based non-profit group Forest Trends.", "description": "Pope Francis urged the people of Mozambique on Thursday to nurture their hard-earned peace and strive to provide equal opportunities for all so as not to slip back into civil war.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426482182&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840SU", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
