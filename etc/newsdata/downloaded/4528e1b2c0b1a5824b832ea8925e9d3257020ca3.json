For example, with Michael Jackson, Freddie and I went to his house to record for eight hours one day.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\n\"This was back in 1983, and Freddie and Michael collaborated on three different tracks at that point.\n\n\"But Michael didn\u2019t treat me any differently than he treated Freddie. It was just the way people are.\n\n\"Michael and I played video games for half an hour while Freddie was outside smoking.\"\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nIt was when they were in Jackson's house that Freddie would become incredulous at how the Thriller singer would sleep at night.\n\nDespite being a multi-million dollar mansion, Jackson didn't have an actual bed but just a mattress on the floor.\n\nThis was something Freddie found incredulous and would rip into Jackson for not having a more traditional bedroom set up.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nPeter recalled: \"Freddie just could not keep his mouth shut because right in the middle of the floor, was this big mattress made up as a bed.\n\n\"Freddie said, 'You\u2019ve got money why don\u2019t you buy a bed?' And Michael just said, 'I feel so much better when I\u2019m closer to the Earth'. Freddie said, 'Well how much closer does not having a bed make you? We\u2019re upstairs\u201d.\u2019\n\n(Image: ullstein bild via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking about how they approached recording together, Peter revealed: \"Each of them were just giving out everything they could to create something and to be present at that sort of thing is amazing.\n\n\"The same the same happened with David Bowie with Under Pressure for Queen.\n\n\"To be present when you have\u2026 it\u2019s almost like electricity. Then you feel tension in the air and there\u2019s that o-zone smell. It\u2019s almost like that.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
