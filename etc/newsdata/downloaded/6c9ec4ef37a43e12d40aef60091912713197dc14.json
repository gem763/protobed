Instead, the judge said DeVos implemented a new methodology that calculated a borrower's eligibility for partial loan forgiveness based on their average earnings.\n\nThe judge also said that the Education Department \"mistakenly notified at least 3,000 Corinthian borrowers that their loans are entering repayment, rather than stopped collection or forbearance status.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKim threatened to \"impose additional sanctions, including the appointment of a Special Master to ensure compliance with the preliminary injunction\u201d if DeVos and the Education Department \u201cfail to comply\u201d with the order.", "description": "A federal judge held Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in contempt of court on Thursday and sanctioned the Education Department with a $100,000 fine after it said DeVos refused\u00a0to comply with a court mandate to cease collection of loans from students who were defrauded by now-defunct Corinthian Colleges.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
