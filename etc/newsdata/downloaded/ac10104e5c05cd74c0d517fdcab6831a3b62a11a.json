He faces up to 47 years in prison but apparently believes the sentence will be reduced to a matter of months, according to a Page Six source.\n\nTekashi already said he will not accept witness protection and plans to hire a personal security detail to protect him around-the-clock instead.\n\nTekashi (left in his mug shot) was charged along with five other Nine Trey members in November 2018 indictment outlining the gang's alleged involvement in drug sales and two shootings in New York City. The rapper (right during his September 17 testimony) immediately flipped against the others and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors\n\nWhether or not he'll be able to afford private security is a different question.\n\nThe rapper's net worth is mysterious. Some say he is worth around $10million and others put his fortune significantly lower at around $1million.\n\nIn either case, his no-doubt mountainous legal bills will take a chunk out of whatever money he has, leaving a shrinking pot for round-the-clock protection.\n\nAs for who will want to make music with him now or endorse him, the prospects are bleak.\n\nBy accusing several fellow rappers of gang involvement during the trial, Tekashi became a pariah in the music industry as many fellow artists described him as a 'hungry' internet star who clung to fame without talent to back it up.\n\nKnown almost as much for his tattooed, rainbow-haired look as for his music, Brooklyn-born Tekashi was a social media phenomenon before becoming an ascendant name in hip-hop.\n\nAt the height of his popularity he had 15.5 million followers on Instagram. Following the trial, that number had dropped by over one million.\n\nTekashi's album Day69: Graduation Day was among the top-sellers on iTunes following its February 2018 release.\n\nHis biggest songs were the multiplatinum hit 'Fefe,' with Nicki Minaj, which peaked at number three on the pop charts, and 'Stoopid,' featuring the incarcerated rapper Bobby Shmurda.", "description": "Tekashi 6ix9ine faces 47 years in prison at his sentencing on December 18.
