The report did not have comparisons with polling places in other regions.\n\nThe report comes as Republican-led states impose a range of other restrictions, from shorter voting hours to photo-ID requirements. As turnout has surged in recent elections, voters in cities like Phoenix and Atlanta have endured hours-long waits to cast their ballots.\n\nSeven counties in Georgia now only have one polling place, the report found.\n\nUnder the Voting Rights Act of 1965, areas with a history of voting discrimination - such as requiring African American or Hispanic voters to pay a poll tax or pass a literacy test - had to first convince the U.S. Justice Department or a federal court that any election changes they wished to make would not have had a discriminatory effect. The Supreme Court struck down that portion of the law in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that anymore - that\u2019s the most troubling thing,\u201d said Leigh Chapman, head of the civil rights group\u2019s voting-rights program.\n\nThe law covered a swath of southern states stretching from Virginia to Texas, along with Arizona, Alaska and a few counties in states like New York, North Carolina, Florida, Michigan, South Dakota and California.\n\nVoters in many U.S. states can now mail in their ballots or vote in person before Election Day. But most still cast their ballots in person in last year\u2019s vote, just as they did in 2012, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\nState election officials have cited a variety of reasons, from budget pressures to disability laws, for closing polling places, while officials in many parts of Texas and Arizona have tried to shift from neighborhood-based polling places to \u201cvoter centers\u201d that accept ballots from all qualified citizens.\n\nThose states saw the sharpest decrease in polling locations, according to the report.\n\nElection officials in Texas have closed more than 1 in 10 voting locations statewide, according to data collected by the Leadership Conference, with the biggest drops in the counties surrounding Dallas and Austin, which have large Hispanic and African American populations.\n\nIn Arizona, more than 1 in 5 polling locations were closed, the data showed.\n\nGeorgia, Louisiana and Mississippi closed roughly 1 in 20 polling locations, while the declines were less dramatic in Alabama, Alaska and North Carolina.\n\nOne notable exception to the trend is South Carolina, where state law requires multiple officials to sign off on any changes. The state has actually added 45 polling locations since 2012.\n\nOverall, those states formerly covered by the law have closed at least 1,688 polling places between 2012 and 2018, the Leadership Conference found. Some 1,173 of those polling places were closed after the 2014 election \u2014 and after the Supreme Court issued its decision.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to compare those results with the United States as a whole. The Election Assistance Commission reported that 231,000 polling places were used nationwide in 2018, up from 120,000 in 2012, but the agency noted that those figures are incomplete as several states do not provide reliable data.", "description": "States across the American South have closed nearly 1,200 polling places since the Supreme Court weakened a landmark voting-discrimination law in 2013, according to a report released by a civil-rights group on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Andy Sullivan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
