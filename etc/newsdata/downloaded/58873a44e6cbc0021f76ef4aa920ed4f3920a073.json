The fresh funds follow on the heels of series A and B rounds totaling $27 million and bring Forward Networks\u2018 total raised to $62.1 million. CEO David Erickson says the money will bolster the expansion of Forward Networks\u2019 sales, marketing, and R&D programs.\n\n\u201cOur customers are seeing dramatic improvements in network availability and operational efficiency by deploying Forward Enterprise,\u201d said Erickson, a Stanford computer science graduate and the author of Beacon, the communications protocol controller at the core of products from Big Switch Networks, Cisco, and others. \u201cThis round of funding is key to expanding our efforts to bring network verification to enterprise customers.\u201d\n\nForward Networks \u2014 which Erickson cofounded with CTO Brandon Heller, Nikhil Handigol, and Peyman Kazemian in 2016 \u2014 develops a platform that documents, searches, and anticipates the behavior of networks by creating an up-to-date copy of their infrastructures. A mapping component maintains topological diagrams complete with detailed inventories of hardware and software across vendors and versions, while predictive algorithms identify connectivity issues and security policy violations in real time.\n\nImage Credit: Forward Networks\n\nWith Forward Networks\u2019 search tool, IT admins can quickly surface behavioral and configuration information, including devices and their corresponding connections. They\u2019re able to perform end-to-end path analysis for on-premises, virtual, and cloud environments to verify a given subnetwork is behaving as intended. And they can continuously monitor networks for noncompliance, as well as snapshot changes in rules, files, routes, and more for posterity.\n\nForward Networks\u2019 API enables clients to integrate its suite into existing network management workflow and tools. They can create apps that show network paths and automate tasks (like updating device credentials), and that create checks from both first-party and third-party policy resources.\n\nThose capabilities evidently impressed the folks at Goldman Sachs, which this past year scaled its deployment of Forward Networks\u2019 enterprise offering to its entire network of over 15,000 devices. \u201cOur network engineering team relies on the Forward platform to be the single source of truth for our network. It\u2019s a critical component for automating our infrastructure,\u201d said Goldman Sachs managing director of technology Joshua Matheus. \u201cThe team here has been so impressed with the scalability and network analysis functionality of Forward Networks\u2019 solution that we decided to lead its funding round. We strongly believe in the company and its product.\u201d\n\nForward Networks competes with startups like Veriflow, which has raised $11.1 million to date for its suite of continuous network verification apps and services. But it\u2019s made a mark for itself in enterprise segments like finance, travel, and IT, according to Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s Bill Krause, where roughly five outages per month at a cost of $740,000 per outage isn\u2019t uncommon Other heavy-hitting customers in Forward Networks\u2019 growing roster include Ubisoft, PayPal, and Telstra.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see the value that Forward Networks\u2019 platform brings to large enterprises running complex networks,\u201d said Krause. \u201cThey have solved a critical business problem, which presents a real growth opportunity.\u201d", "description": "Forward Networks, which creates virtual copies of networks to monitor them for operations-breaking changes, has raised $35 million in venture capital.", "authors": ["Kyle Wiggers"], "top_image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/forward-networks_above_logo.png?w=1200&strip=all", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
