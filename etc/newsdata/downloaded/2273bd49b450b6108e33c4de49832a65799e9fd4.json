But simple rate cuts now rather old-fashioned compared to the ECB\u2019s comprehensive and complicated package of easing measures last week.\n\n8:01PM\n\nIn response to a question on the US-China trade war, Powell says: \"Trade policy is weighing on the outlook.\"\n\nHe adds that the Federal Reserve can\u2019t give businesses a settled road map for global trade but that it does have tools to help companies which allows it to support job creation and give consumers the confidence to buy items such as durable goods.\n\n7:55PM\n\nSomeone has asked: What\u2019s caused the sudden jump in the repo rate this week, and are you worried?\n\nMr Powell that he is no worries and that the jump in the repo rate was caused by tax bills and the cost of settling bond purchases.\n\n#Fed 's Powell on Repo blowout: Market response to funding issues was surprising.

Turki al-Malki displays what he describes as an Iranian cruise missile and drones used in an attack this weekend that targeted the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry, during a press conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Credit: Amr Nabil /AP More\n\nReacting to Donald Trump\u2019s decision to order further sanctions against Iran, the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Cailin Birch said the President\u2019s decision was \u201cunsurprising\u201d, for three reasons:\n\nFirst, Mr Trump has been very clear in his desire to avoid outright military conflict with Iran Second, there are few options for targeted military strikes that would not have set of a round of tit-for-tat attacks Third, a reciprocal strike against Iran's oil infrastructure would be fairly toothless\n\nShe concluded:\n\nFor that reason, further sanctions on Iran's economy are actually the most effective, most damaging response that the US could take \u2014 and it helps Mr Trump to achieve his goal of keeping the US out of a complex military conflict in the Middle East. Mr Trump has a proven track record of imposing tough sanctions prior to negotiations (on foreign policy, trade, nuclear disarmament), in order to boost his leverage. The next round of US sanctions, therefore, do not rule out the possibility that Mr Trump will seek to open talks with Iran in the coming months. However, there is a serious risk that Iran will now refuse this invitation, so as not to begin talks in a position of weakness.\n\n4:07PM\n\nThings are still ticking along in the Supreme Court...\n\n...where the lawyers are possibly getting overexcited (Aidan O\u2019Neill is speaking for those challenging the prorogation of Parliament):\n\n\"We've got the Mother of Parliaments being shut down by the Father of Lies,\" Aidan O'Neill tells the Supreme Court \u2014 Matthew Holehouse (@mattholehouse) September 18, 2019\n\nFollow along here: Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson cannot be trusted not to use \u2018dirty tricks\u2019, Supreme Court hears\n\n4:04PM\n\nTfL: Elizabeth Line still on track for launch by early 2021\n\nA walkway for the new Elizabeth Line at Liverpool Street station in London Credit: Victoria Jones/PA More\n\nIn a filing this afternoon, Transport for London has confirmed the Elizabeth Line (also known as Crossrail) is still on track to be opened on time, and within the same funding window.

They report:\n\nThe London Metal Exchange (LME) will postpone plans to ban metal tainted by human rights abuses until 2025, giving producers three more years to comply with guidelines and the exchange time to rethink its approach, industry sources said. Under the initial plan announced in April, the exchange had set 2022 as the deadline to bar metal from the LME\u2019s lists of approved brands whose extraction involved abuses such as child labour or which was tainted by corruption. The initiative to ensure responsible sourcing followed an outcry about cobalt mined by children in Africa. Two industry sources directly involved with the process said the deadline had been pushed back to 2025 in part because some major producers would not go along with the LME's original plan.\n\nYou can read the full report here: London Metal Exchange to delay ban on tainted metal until 2025 \u2014 sources\n\n3:23PM\n\nFedex shares stagger after it cuts profit outlook\n\nThe delivery firm is exposed to global economic worries Credit: MARIO ANZUONI/REUTERS More\n\nShares in delivery giant FedEx have dropped sharply since US markets opened, after the company slashed its forecasts \u2014 blaming a slowdown in the global economy.\n\nIn a press conference to discuss earnings late on Tuesday, chief executive Fred Smith said:\n\nThe global economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to cut capacity\n\nShares are down nearly 13pc currently.\n\nWall Street has opened downbeat more broadly:\n\nCredit: Bloomberg TV More\n\n3:14PM\n\nSports Direct writes to business department as auditor appointment deadline passes\n\nSports Direct boss Mike Ashley Credit: John Nguyen/JNVisuals More\n\nWith a week passed (has it only been that long?!) since Sports Direct\u2019s annual general meeting, the trouble-prone retailer still hasn\u2019t appointed an auditor to replace Grant Thornton.\n\nAlthough that strictly means that the government should now appoint an accountancy firm to do the job, it looks like Mike Ashley\u2019s firm is going to play for time.

Author Liz Capo McCormick writes:\n\nFed interventions in the repo market, like the one deployed Tuesday and planned for Wednesday, were commonplace for decades before the crisis. Then they stopped when the central bank changed how it enacted policy by expanding its balance sheet and using a target rate band. The tumult seen Monday and Tuesday doesn\u2019t mean another global funding crisis, even though trouble getting funds through repo a decade ago doomed Lehman Brothers and almost snuffed out the global financial system. But, many experts say, these wild few days show that there\u2019s not enough reserves -- or excess money that banks park at the Fed \u2014 in the banking system.\n\nIf the damage done is extreme enough, the US Federal Reserve might have to undertake some unexpected quantitative easing to to grow its balance sheet, or purchase debt in order to create new reserves.\n\nThe Fed funds rate, another measure of borrowing costs, also spiked above the target range about forty minutes ago \u2014 suggesting the central bank may be losing its grip on some crucial rates.\n\n2:31PM\n\nWSJ: Huawei banned from global cybersecurity forum\n\nThe White House has branded Huawei a security risk Credit: Hannibal Hanschke/REUTERS More\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is reporting that Chinese tech giant Huawei has been banned from the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, a major cybersecurity trade event.\n\nThe Journal reports:\n\nThe step effectively freezes Huawei out of discussions among members of the group over matters such as software glitches.

The Registry said the southern market had witnessed a \u201csustained slowdown\u201d. The average UK home now costs \u00a3233,000 \u2013 \u00a32,000 more than in July 2018 \u2013 but the modest overall gain disguises huge variances within regional markets.

Sirius planned to dig two 5,000-foot mine shafts and build a 23-mile tunnel to transport the potash to Teesside, where it would be shipped to countries all over the world. It would have been one of the biggest engineering projects being undertaken anywhere in Britain, creating 4,000 jobs, in a region where unemployment is among the worst in the country... ...Surely this is the sort of project that Brexit Britain is crying out for?\n\nHis conclusion, however, is that Sirius can\u2019t go forward from here, saying the company \u201cmay have vanished down the black hole for good\n\nYou can read his full thoughts here: Sirius Minerals\u2019 dreams to turn North Yorkshire into a global mining hub are dead and buried\n\n11:52AM\n\nEddie Stobart confirms it has received takeover offer\n\nEddie Stobart is perhaps best known for its fleet of green lorries Credit: Eddie Stobart/PA More\n\nIn a filing this morning, beleaguered haulage firm Eddie Stobart told the City it has recieved a \u201chighly preliminary expression of interest\u201d from a group controlled by Andrew Tinkler.\n\nThe offer, made through the vehicle TVFC (3) Limited, follows news that investor DBAY is also considering making a bid for the company, shares in which are suspended following an accounting issue.\n\nEddie Stobart said:\n\nThe company emphasis that there can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made.

Senior economist Jason Lennard said:\n\nConsumer price inflation was lower than expected at 1.7 per cent in the year to August 2019. Our analysis of 130,000 goods and services included in the basket suggests that fewer firms raised prices than is typical for this time of year. Firms are probably waiting to see beyond 31 October before adjusting prices. The slowing of inflation was widespread, falling in 10 of the 12 regions of the United Kingdom with the biggest drops in Northern Ireland and Wales.\n\n11:08AM\n\nJeremy Warner: National Grid needs \u2018bold policy action\u2019 \u2014 but not to be nationalised\n\nAs operator of the electricity transmission network, National Grid will play a key role in the coming energy transition Credit: DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP More\n\nIn his column today, the Telegraph\u2019s Jeremy Warner has taken a look at National Grid, as it treads the tough path to reach net zero carbon emissions. Jeremy writes:\n\nUncertainty over Brexit hangs like a cloud over previously supportive international sentiment. But in Grid\u2019s case, it is more specific than that. Unpredictable politics has fuelled suspicion of the regulatory regime, with trust in its governance collapsing alongside trust in politics. Labour plans to renationalise the electricity industry, including National Grid, act as a further deterrent. The curiosity here is that like the pound sterling, the more the present Government disintegrates, the more the share price rebounds.\n\nYou can read his full thoughts here: National Grid has a unique bet on net zero by 2050.

The 1.7pc print actually exceeded the Committee\u2019s August Inflation Report forecast of 1.6pc. In addition, half of the sharp fall in the headline rate was driven by further volatility in the price of computer games.\n\nHere\u2019s Pantheon\u2019s prediction for the coming years:\n\nCredit: Pantheon Macroeconomics More\n\n10:05AM\n\nEconomist: Inflation rate could let Bank turn dovish\n\nReacting to those inflation figures, Capital Economics\u2019 Andrew Wishart said:\n\nOur forecast is for overall inflation to stay around 2pc until the end of this year as a fall in utilities prices is offset by increases to inflation-linked duty on tobacco and a pick-up in core inflation. The risk to our view, which was borne out in today\u2019s release, is that core services inflation fails to pick up pace, as strong wage growth suggests it should. At the margin, this might allow the [Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee] to strike a more dovish tone at tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\n\n10:03AM\n\nHouse price growth slows\n\nHouse price growth was 0.7pc year-on-year Credit: Christopher Furlong/Getty More\n\nAlongside the CPI figures, the ONS released its latest house price index, which slows the year-on-year rate of house price growth slowed in July.\n\nFour regions saw prices drop (South East, London, East and North East), with the overall slowdown driven by the south:\n\nCredit: ONS More\n\nCredit: ONS More\n\nThe ONS said:\n\nAt a regional level, Yorkshire and The Humber was the English region with the highest annual house price growth, with prices increasing by 3.2pc in the year to July 2019.

Allied with falling inflation, the sturdy growth in pay packets will temporarily boost households\u2019 spending power and offer some uplift to retailers. However, domestic and international factors are conspiring to push UK prices up in the near future. Higher wages will eventually translate into inflationary pressure, while the recent decline in the value of the pound and concerns over oil supply will lead to increased input costs for British firms, raising prices across the supply chain. The Bank of England will no doubt be wary of the upside risks to inflation down the line. Despite this, with subdued economic growth, a disorderly no-deal Brexit still possible, and a global slowdown thrown into the mix, the MPC is likely to keep interest rates on hold to support the economy.\n\n9:46AM\n\nInflation drops to lowest since 2016\n\nComputer game prices contributed to growth Credit: Chesnot/Getty More\n\nThe UK\u2019s inflation rate has hit its lowest level since December 2016, driven by rising prices for video games and clothes.\n\nThe year-on-year consumer prices index rose by 1.7pc in August, down from 2.1pc in July, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThe ONS\u2019s Mike Hardie said:\n\nThe inflation rate has fallen noticeably into August, to its lowest since late 2016.

It was the first intervention of its type since the financial crisis.\n\nIf that is already making your head hurt or prompting you to nod off, here\u2019s the short version: repurchasing agreements are a crucial part of the financial system\u2019s \u2018plumbing\u2019, through which companies temporarily borrow dollars. When it goes wrong, it creates big disruptions.\n\nFollowing the intervention, the rate seems to have returned to normal levels.

The company said:\n\nThe principal driver of the group\u2019s performance was the reduction in the level of used car stock to more appropriate levels, which was actively managed during the second quarter through a combination of both lower retail pricing and clearance through trade auction channels. These necessary actions resulted in significant losses in the period, exacerbated by market-driven reduction in used car values.\n\nThe small-cap company is currently searching for a new chief executive, after former boss Mark Herbert quit at the start of the summer after just three months in the position.\n\n8:51AM\n\nAccesso announces progress with sale; results in line despite revenue fall\n\nAccesso Technology, the AIM-listed firm that provides tech solutions for point-on-sale systems, virtual ticketing and queuing, announced its performance during the first half of the year was \u201cbroadly in-line\u201d with expectations, as a 6.8pc decline in revenue was offset by lower-than=anticipated costs.\n\nIt said the formal sales process that it launched in July following high bid interest is ongoing, adding:\n\nThe company recently held management presentations with a number of interested parties and is expected to receive feedback by the end of September 2019.\n\n8:41AM\n\nGames Workshop announces 35p-a-share dividend as trading meets expectations\n\nGames Workshop makes the Warhammer tabletop games Credit: Games Workshop More\n\nGames Workshop, the company behind the Warhammer tabletop games, has announced it will pay a dividend of 35p per share after saying trading is on track to hit expectations.\n\nIn an update ahead of its annual general meeting at 10am today, chairman Nick Donaldson said:\n\nGames Workshop Group PLC announces today that trading is in line with the Board's expectations.

Are you hoping that the interest rate rate will fall?\n\nThe US Federal Reserve is widely expected to make another rate cut this evening, a jolt of stimulus they hope will stop the American economy succumbing to a global slowdown. Today promises to be one of this year's most closely-watched decisions on financial markets \u2014 and the latest showdown between Fed chair Jerome Powell and President Donald Trump.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) The biggest decision on financial markets: Five things to watch out for at the US Fed. All eyes will turn to Washington this evening but for once the US president will not be hogging the limelight. The Federal Reserve - the US central bank - will release its latest decision on interest rates, a vote that will reverberate in financial hubs across the globe.\n\n2) Britain's workers urgently need a wave of investment in robots because a more modern and productive economy will result in more jobs and better pay, according to MPs. Contrary to fears that automation will push people out of work, the new technology will in fact secure jobs and create new roles by making the country more competitive on the global market, the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee found.\n\n3) Banking technology start-up GoCardless expands to America: The financial technology start-up said the decision to expand its service, which allows businesses to receive direct debit payments online, to America has taken several years of planning and negotiations with regulators.\n\n4) Thousands of retail investors risk losing their money in Sirius Minerals afterit admitted its plan to build a fertiliser mine in Yorkshire was on the brink of collapse and the Government appeared to rule out a rescue. The FTSE 250 company warned that it had been unable to sell a $500m (\u00a3400m) junk bond it needed to unlock $2.5bn in debt financing from JPMorgan, throwing the future of its ambitious scheme to mine under the North York Moors into doubt.\n\n5) Oil price lurches lower as Saudis claim quick recovery from attacks: Global oil markets made an abrupt U-turn yesterday as crude prices fell on hopes that Saudi Arabia could bounce back far more quickly than feared from the drone attacks which crippled production.\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nOil prices cooled on Wednesday as Saudi Arabia said full oil production would be restored by month\u2019s end while caution ahead of an expected US interest rate cut kept wider financial markets in tight ranges.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.13pc while Japan's Nikkei was flat.
