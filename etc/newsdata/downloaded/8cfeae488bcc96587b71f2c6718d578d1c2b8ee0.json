It was completely split in every way - my cheek was pretty much hanging off.\"\n\nTragically, the road accident left Denise with permanent facial scars.\n\nHeartbroken by what had happened, she found herself becoming a recluse.\n\nShe said: \"After the accident, I wasn't going out at all. I\u2019d changed, I wasn't the person I used to be. I was put on anti-depressants.\n\n\"When I returned to my job at Next, I went to work in the office in the back - I couldn\u2019t face people.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t even go to the supermarket on my own, I needed someone to hold my hand.\n\n\"I never wanted to be in the limelight, my scars couldn\u2019t even be covered up with makeup as I suffer from hypertrophic scarring.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOver the next 15 years, Denise would start the slow progression back to normality.\n\nShe said: \"I moved back home and joined the gym and started weightlifting. The biggest thing for me was quitting sugar.\"\n\nDenise also became a mother to two girls.\n\nShe added: \"People were still interested in me to do jobs as a model.\n\n\"My boyfriend would say to me that I should start it again, but I didn't want to with the scars on my face.\"\n\nIt would only be in January this year that Denise, now 39-years-old, would reignite her teenage dreams.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo WS)\n\nShe said: \" Alison Jackson\u2019s [an English artist known for her look-alike photographs of celebrities] assistant found some pictures of me on social media.\n\n\"She asked me to do a flash mob with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle look-alikes and at the time I had a bit more confidence.\n\n\"I did the event and met some other look-alikes and thought 'I can do this'.\n\nSince January, Denise has been inundated with booking and requests.\n\nExplaining what she does, she said: \"At look-alike events you get booked, turn up and pose for pictures with everyone.\n\n\"But it can be different, when I went to Germany, I was taken to a studio and had my makeup done and outfit changes for shooting different products.\n\n\"And for Halloween I\u2019ve been booked for a yacht party in London.\"\n\nAs for the future, Denise said: \"I never like to think too far ahead, I'm focusing on helping a homeless charity, but as long as people want me, I'll keep on doing it.\"", "description": "Denise Ohnona, 39, is reigniting her teenage dream of being a model after a devastating car crash changed her life forever", "authors": ["Lottie Gibbons", "Image", "Liverpool Echo Ws", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20524722.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Denise-Ohnona.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
