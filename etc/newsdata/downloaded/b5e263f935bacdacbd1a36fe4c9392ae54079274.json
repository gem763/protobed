She later left the hotel.\n\nCohen's lawyer told the Post that the director recalls meeting Jane at a bar in 2015, but denies being in a hotel room with her or sexually assaulting her. The Post reported that medical records confirmed that she immediately sought treatment for sexual assault after the alleged incident and confided in two people about what she came to regard as an assault.\n\nAbout two years after the incident, numerous accusations of sexual assault and harassment against producing mogul Harvey Weinstein persuaded Jane to text Cohen about the incident.\n\n\"The night we met, you really hurt me and f----d me up,\" she wrote, according to the Post. Cohen reportedly responded that he was \"So sorry to hear this,\" before he called her the next day, and allegedly apologized for \"causing her pain.\"\n\nCohen told the Post through his lawyer that his apology pertained to his thinking that she was unhappy with the money she received on the now-defunct project.\n\nJane told the Post she left the matter rest after the exchange, but decided to pursue more action when Cohen's daughter, Valkyrie Weather, alleged her father had assaulted her when she was a child. Weather detailed her allegations in an account posted to Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.\n\nRead more: The daughter of the 'Fast and the Furious' director is accusing him of sexually assaulting her when she was 2 years old\n\nWeather accused her father molesting her when she was two years old, allegedly taking her to visit prostitutes in Asia and eastern Europe when she was underage, and openly bragging about sexually assaulting an unidentified woman.\n\n\"When I was very young, Rob used my body for his own sexual gratification.
