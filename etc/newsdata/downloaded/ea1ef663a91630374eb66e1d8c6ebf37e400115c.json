After all, the Apple Watch\u2019s most important job is telling the time, right?\n\nWhile that may be true, there\u2019s a good chance your Apple Watch turns into a blank black square for most of the day as it sits idly on your wrist.\n\nThat\u2019s about to change with the Apple Watch Series 5, which the company is launching on Friday with a price starting at $400. The new model comes with a new always-on display that can show information like the date, the weather, your activity progress, and any other metric you can add as a complication to one of Apple\u2019s watch faces \u2013 even when the screen isn\u2019t activated.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the few features that distinguish the Apple Watch Series 5 from its predecessor, the Series 4, which Apple no longer sells. Other than a screen that doesn\u2019t turn off, the new watch comes with a built-in compass and the ability to call emergency services even when traveling internationally.\n\nRead more: The iPhone 11 proves Apple learned an important lesson after last year\u2019s iPhone launch \u2013 most people don\u2019t want to pay $1,000 for a new smartphone\n\nI\u2019ve only just unboxed the Apple Watch Series 5, but here\u2019s a look at the characteristics that have stood out to me so far. Our full review will dive more deeply into these features and other details about the watch.\n\nThe Series 5\u2019s always-on display is more advanced than the Fitbit Versa 2\u2019s.\n\nThe $200 Fitbit Versa 2, arguably the Apple Watch\u2019s biggest rival, also has a display that stays on even when it\u2019s inactive. Fitbit\u2019s functionality, however, seems very limited compared with Apple\u2019s.\n\nAll of Apple\u2019s watch faces are optimized to work in always-on-display mode, which slows the refresh rate down to as low as 1 Hz to preserve power. That means you can choose which bits of information you want to see at a glance \u2013 like the weather, your next calendar event, or a recent timer \u2013 by adding them as complications to your watch face.\n\nIt also makes the transition between the low-power always-on display and the regular display feel more seamless. Most of the watch faces I\u2019ve tried so far on the Apple Watch subtly become brighter and crisper as you raise your wrist to activate the display. For certain clock faces with metrics that refresh quickly, like the seconds on the Activity Digital watch face, those elements disappear in always-on mode and resume when the display is activated.\n\nEven after using the watch for only a couple of hours, I noticed how convenient it is to see the time and weather just by looking down at my wrist without having to move or touch the screen.\n\nThat\u2019s very different from the experience of using the Versa 2\u2019s always-on display, which shows only the time, the battery life, the date, and exercise statistics. It also doesn\u2019t transition into its regular display mode automatically when you raise your wrist, as this new Apple Watch does.\n\nHere\u2019s what some of Apple\u2019s watch faces look like on the always-on display. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re a bit dimmer than usual.\n\nActivity Digital\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nKaleidoscope\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nInfograph\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nThe compass will be useful for hikers and city dwellers.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nWhile you certainly don\u2019t need a compass to get from point A to point B in 2019, having one definitely makes it easier.\n\nThe most useful application for the Apple Watch Series 5\u2019s compass will likely be the watch\u2019s Maps app, since it makes it possible to see which direction you\u2019re facing so you can make sure you\u2019re going the right way.\n\nThat can be especially useful for people who live in big cities and often walk or take the subway, as well as hikers who want to make sure they\u2019re staying on the right track.\n\nBut mostly it feels the same.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson\n\nThe Apple Watch\u2019s always-on display and built-in compass make the watch much more useful when it comes to two important use cases: telling the time, and getting directions.\n\nBut if you have a Series 4, you shouldn\u2019t feel compelled to upgrade. The always-on display is the Series 5\u2019s most appealing new feature, but that alone doesn\u2019t justify a $400 purchase. The Series 4 and 5 share many of the same features otherwise; they even feel the same, at 10.7 millimeters thin, and essentially offer the same speed and performance.\n\nI\u2019d give the same advice to most people thinking about upgrading from the Series 3, unless features like the ability to take an electrocardiogram reading and detect hard falls \u2013 both of which were introduced on the Series 4 \u2013 are also high priorities of yours.", "description": "Business Insider - The Apple Watch Series 5 comes with an always-on display that makes it feel like a much more capable wristwatch.
