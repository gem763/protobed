Schiff (D-Calif.) warned of possible legal action Thursday if intelligence officials did not share a potentially explosive whistleblower complaint prompted by President Trump\u2019s interactions with a foreign leader.\n\nSchiff called acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire\u2019s refusal to share the complaint with Congress \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said he understood the Justice Department was involved in that decision.\n\n\u201cWe cannot get an answer to the question about whether the White House is also involved in preventing this information from coming to Congress,\u201d Schiff said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is to make sure that the national security is protected.\u201d\n\nSomeone, Schiff said, \u201cis trying to manipulate the system to keep information about an urgent matter from the Congress. ... There certainly are a lot of indications that it was someone at a higher pay grade than the director of national intelligence.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post first reported Wednesday, Trump\u2019s interactions with the foreign leader included a \u201cpromise\u201d that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an unidentified U.S. intelligence official to file a whistleblower complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community.\n\nTrump has denied doing anything improper.\n\n[Trump\u2019s communications with foreign leader are part of whistleblower complaint that spurred standoff between spy chief and Congress, former officials say]\n\nSchiff spoke following a closed-door appearance before committee members by the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, who reviewed the complaint and determined it was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of \u201curgent concern,\u201d a legal threshold that requires notification of congressional oversight committees.\n\nIt was not a single conversation that prompted the whistleblower complaint, Atkinson told the committee, according to two people familiar with the inspector general\u2019s remarks to lawmakers Thursday. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose details of the private meeting.\n\nDuring the meeting, Atkinson declined to provide any additional details about the whistleblower complaint, Schiff said. The congressman said he does not know if reports by The Post and other media outlets about its contents are accurate.\n\nMaguire\u2019s refusal to share the complaint has touched off a legal and political dispute that has spilled into public view and prompted speculation that the spy chief may be improperly protecting the president.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring with the House general counsel what our options are,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI would imagine if it comes down that we have to go to court to get this that we will have a very good case to seek a temporary restraining order or a mandamus or some urgent form of relief because the inspector general has said this cannot wait. \u2026 There\u2019s an urgency here that I think the courts will recognize.\u201d\n\nSchiff said Maguire is scheduled to appear before his committee in a public session next week and \u201che can explain why this urgent concern should not be shared with the Congress.\u201d\n\n[\u2018I, nevertheless, respectfully disagree\u2019: Read the inspector general\u2019s letter questioning determination to withhold whistleblower complaint from lawmakers]\n\nSchiff spoke to reporters after Trump disputed the report that his interaction with a foreign leader had prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a whistleblower complaint, saying it was inconceivable that he would say anything inappropriate.\n\n\u201cVirtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cKnowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\u201d\n\nTrump dismissed the report as \u201cFake News\u201d and said in another tweet that he was subject to \u201cPresidential Harassment!\u201d\n\n....Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u201cheavily populated\u201d call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019\n\nIf Schiff opts to go to court, Democrats say their case will be buoyed by Atkinson\u2019s determination that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was \u201curgent\u201d and the lengths to which he went to alert the Intelligence Committee of its existence \u2014 writing letters in which he questioned Maguire\u2019s determination to withhold the complaint from lawmakers.\n\n\u201cI understand that I am bound by the determination reached as a result of the Acting DNI\u2019s consultations with DOJ, and the ICIG will continue to abide by that determination,\u201d Atkinson wrote in a Sept. 17 letter to panel leaders. ICIG stands for intelligence community inspector general.\n\n\u201cI, nevertheless, respectfully disagree with that determination,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe subject matter involved in the Complainant\u2019s disclosure not only falls within the DNI\u2019s jurisdiction, but relates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\n\n[Acting spy chief won\u2019t comply with House subpoena over whistleblower complaint, escalating clash]\n\nAtkinson faulted the Justice Department\u2019s conclusion \u201cparticularly \u2026 and the Acting DNI\u2019s apparent agreement with the conclusion, that the disclosure in this case does not concern an intelligence activity within the DNI\u2019s authority.\u201d He wrote, too, that he had requested permission from Maguire to inform the congressional intelligence committees about the general subject matter of the complaint, but was denied.\n\nAtkinson concluded that Maguire\u2019s wholesale opposition to disclosing the details of the complaint to Congress not only marked a sharp departure from past practice, but also \u201cmay itself constitute a significant problem and deficiency concerning the DNI\u2019s responsibility and authority relating to intelligence programs or activities.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Justice Department responded to Atkinson\u2019s charge by pointing to a Sept. 13 letter from Maguire\u2019s general counsel, Jason Klitenic, to the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees, explaining the administration\u2019s rationale for not providing the complaint to lawmakers.\n\nIn that letter, Klitenic argued that \u201cthere were serious concerns about whether the complaint met the statutory definition of an \u2018urgent concern.\u2019 \u201d Those concerns, he explained, led to consultation with the Justice Department.\n\nShane Harris, Greg Miller and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.", "description": "The Post has reported that the complaint was prompted by President Trump\u2019s interactions with a foreign leader.
