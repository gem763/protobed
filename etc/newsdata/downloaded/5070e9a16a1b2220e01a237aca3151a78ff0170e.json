It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads the world\u2019s two biggest nuclear powers can deploy.", "description": "Russia's most advanced new nuclear-powered submarine test-launched a Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time and hit a target thousands of kilometres away, the Defence Ministry said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
