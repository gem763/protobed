We were a little bit off, fought back, got our lap back, made some changes and got the car better. I guess she caught the lucky dog after she went a lap down from the tire blowout she had, and I guess she thought that was a desperate move for her, to start moving people with her car.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTensions between both parties intensified after the race near the garage area, according to Home Tracks:\n\nDeegan returned to her hauler to see Souza and his crew chief, Michael Munoz, visibly and audibly frustrated. The two needed to be restrained by Bill McAnally Racing general manager Kevin Bellicourt, as they were voicing their displeasure at Deegan\u2019s crew chief Kyle Wolosek.\n\nDeegan alleged Souza \u201ccussed me out\u201d during the heated exchange.\n\n\u201cI was a little nervous there for a second. He started coming in my trailer as I was sitting down. There was a brief second where I thought he was going to do something there,\u201d the 18-year-old said.\n\nDeegan finished ninth in the Monaco Cocktails Gateway Classic 125 and Souza placed 10th. He promised retribution in the next event.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to some bigger tracks later in the year and there will be a payback,\u201d Souza said, also likening Deegan\u2019s driving habits to those of \u201ca spoiled rotten little baby.\u201d\n\nAs for Deegan, she maintains she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to take him out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he thought I was trying to dump him or something,\u201d Deegan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t need a caution, we were coming to the end. He was in the way, he moved out of the way and moved up. It\u2019s not like I came cross his nose and tried to take him out again.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI needed to go.
