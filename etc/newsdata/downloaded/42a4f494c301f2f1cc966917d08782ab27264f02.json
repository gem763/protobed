It was also intended to prove, in a walk-and-chew-gum kind of way, that he could multitask even when facing withering political fire \u2013 unveiling a serious policy proposal on guns early Wednesday in Las Vegas, then pivoting to a sharp political attack by nightfall in the north.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d\n\nThe American people, Mr Biden said, \u201cknow me and they know him. The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone\u2019s credibility is a joke.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, speaking at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas, Mr Biden excoriated the president and jokingly pretended to mispronounce the last name of his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who has communicated with Ukrainian officials on Mr Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nHe said there was \u201czero, zero, zero\u201d evidence that his family had done anything wrong.\n\nMr Biden\u2019s increasingly bitter fight with Trump comes at a potential tipping point in the 2020 Democratic presidential race. Until recently, Mr Biden had been leading in most national polls since he entered the field last spring.\n\nBut senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, fueled by a highly disciplined campaign, has surged in many early-voting states.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nMr Biden\u2019s team has been alarmed by reports that Trump\u2019s supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly \u2013 despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim.\n\nAnd Mr Biden\u2019s top advisers have been equally incensed by what they view as the news media\u2019s willingness to air unsupported allegations by Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani.\n\nThe president and his lawyer have alleged that Mr Biden, as vice president, pressured the Ukrainians to force out a top prosecutor to derail an inquiry into a Ukrainian company that paid his son, Hunter Biden. But Mr Biden said Wednesday that he had been enforcing the demands of the Obama administration and other Western nations by seeking to replace the prosecutor with an official more committed to fighting corruption.\n\nOn Sunday, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, two senior Biden strategists, wrote to several major television networks asking them to stop booking Mr Giuliani on their news programmes, accusing him of spreading \u201cdebunked conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nMr Biden amplified that argument Wednesday, urging reporters to regard Trump\u2019s statements, and his tweets, as not simply fodder for controversy but as a dangerous \u201cabuse of power\u201d that included enlisting foreign leaders as allies in his re-election effort.\n\nMr Trump, he said, is \u201cafraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.\u201d\n\nThe president, in his own remarks Wednesday, did not agree.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates,\u201d Mr Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Former vice president Joe Biden on Wednesday night delivered his most forceful response yet to president Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on him and his son, accusing the Trump team of waging a campaign of \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling\u201d geared at knocking him out of the presidential race.", "authors": ["Glenn Thrush"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/08/joe-biden-nevada.jpg"}
