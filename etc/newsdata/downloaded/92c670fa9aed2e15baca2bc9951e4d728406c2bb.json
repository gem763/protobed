(AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Friday pressed his argument that the House impeachment inquiry is nothing more than an attempt to overturn his election.\n\nTrump found a sympathetic audience in Louisiana, where an arena packed with his supporters roared at his profane denunciations of the proceedings hundreds of miles away in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cThey know they can\u2019t win on Election Day so they\u2019re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional, bulls\u2014 impeachment,\u201d Trump thundered at his second political rally in as many days.\n\nTrump also pressed his unproven claims against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president.\n\nTrump complained about a double standard in news media coverage. He said if any of his children were similarly accused, the media wouldn\u2019t call the allegations unsubstantiated \u2014 \u201cThey would be saying, \u2018Where\u2019s the nearest cell?'\u201d\n\nThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden.\n\nHouse Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry over Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, in which he asked that country\u2019s president during a telephone call in July to investigate Biden. An intelligence community whistleblower complained that Trump was abusing his office for personal political gain.\n\nTrump insists he didn\u2019t do anything wrong and has called the conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy has said he was not pressured by Trump.", "description": "LAKE CHARLES, La.
