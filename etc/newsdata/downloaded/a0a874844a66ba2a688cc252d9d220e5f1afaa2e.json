The projectile hit the waters in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Japanese government said.\n\nSouth Korea's Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo said an Aegis destroyer detected one missile launch, which flew 450 km (280 miles) in a lofted trajectory 910 km (565 miles) high.\n\nNorth Korea's state news agency KCNA said on Thursday the missile was a Pukgukson-3 test-fired at a high angle in the waters off Wonsan designed to contain external threat and bolster self-defense, but gave no other details.\n\nPhotos released in the North's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed a black-and-white painted missile emerging and clearing the surface of the water, then the booster rocket igniting to propel it into the sky.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that, according to initial intelligence, the missile was a submarine-capable ballistic missile launched from a platform at sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT NEW THREAT DOES IT POTENTIALLY REPRESENT?\n\nIf the missile had been launched on a standard trajectory, the range would have been up to 1,900 km (1,200 miles), which would put it in the medium-range missile class.\n\nThat missile would have all of South Korea and Japan within range. A launch from a submarine deployed in the surrounding waters would pose greater difficulty for missile defenses.\n\nThe threat of a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) grows exponentially with the range of the submarine. The North's existing Romeo-class submarines, which were built in the 1990s, are believed to have a range of about 7,000 km, potentially making a one-way trip to near Hawaii possible.\n\nBut they are diesel-electric powered and very noisy, making them highly vulnerable to detection, especially by U.S. forces with their decades of experience tracking Soviet submarines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE PROGRESS OF NORTH KOREA'S SLBM PROGRAM?\n\nNorth Korea began testing submarine-launched ballistic missiles in 2015 and conducted four submarine launches by August 2016, when a two-stage solid-fuel Pukguksong missile flew about 500 km (310 miles) on a lofted trajectory. That test was considered a success.\n\nThere has been no known tests since then to suggest the North has made progress in developing an SLBM of intermediate or long ranges.\n\nThose previous launches were conducted near the port city of Sinpo, about 110 km from Wonsan and home to many of the North's fleet of submarines, believed to be one of the world's largest.\n\nDespite the size of the fleet, most of the vessels are believed to be small or vintage Soviet-era models and only one is believed to be an experimental submarine capable of carrying a ballistic missile.\n\nNorth Korea said in July leader Kim Jong Un inspected a large, newly built submarine that was near operational deployment.\n\nAnalysts said photos released on the North's state media suggested the vessel could be a modified Romeo class type with an enlarged hull, not the larger submarine satellite images have suggested was being built at the Sinpo shipyard.\n\n\n\n\n\nSECOND-STRIKE CAPABILITY?\n\nSubmarine-launched ballistic missiles are considered key to delivering a second-strike capability that can be used to retaliate against a nuclear attack.", "description": "North Korea fired what may be a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) on Wednesday, which would be the first test in three years of what had been a relatively young but rapidly progressing program to deliver nuclear weapons.
