Went to a friend\u2019s house. The Dickens\u2019 house. A family friend,\u201d Jones told ESPN. \u201cObviously it was heartbreaking when [kicker Adam] Vinatieri made that field goal.\u201d\n\nJones admitted the loss didn\u2019t make him hate Brady, he was just upset for his Panthers.\n\nKANSAS CITY CHIEFS' TYREEK HILL GOES AIRBORNE FOR FIRST TOUCHDOWN IN RETURN FROM INJURY\n\n\u201cNot really. Don\u2019t think I knew that much at that age. Knew I liked the Panthers,\u201d he said.\n\nIt didn\u2019t appear that the thought of a revenge game did enough to fuel Jones and the Giants. He was 15-for-31 with 161 passing yards, a touchdown and three interceptions in the 35-14 loss.\n\nJones has started four games, and played in five, this season since taking over for Eli Manning. This season, he has five touchdown passes, 921 passing yards and six interceptions.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nNew York is 2-4 this season.", "description": "For New York Giants rookie Daniel Jones, Tom Brady was a rival even before he could step onto an NFL field.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
