The title?\n\nOnly this: \u201cIt\u2019s Time for Black Athletes to Leave White Colleges.\u201d\n\nHill couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\n\u201cVery proud that my first magazine piece for @TheAtlantic is appearing in the October issue,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cBeen working on it for some time. Here it is.\u201d\n\nAnd she linked to it.\n\nAnd readers, beware. The text doesn\u2019t disappoint the title.\n\nHere\u2019s one line: \u201c[S]ome black students feel safer, both physically and emotionally, on an HBCU campus \u2014 all the more so as racial tensions have risen in recent years. Navigating a predominantly white campus as a black student can feel isolating, even for athletes.\u201d\n\nHBCU, as she helpfully explains in the first paragraph, is short for Historically Black College or University.\n\nBut yikes, right? Her point of view could just easily apply to whites navigating a campus dominated by blacks \u2014 that the white student could feel isolated, even if an athlete. Only saying so would incur angry leftist accusations of racist, racist, racist.\n\n\u201cTop black athletes,\u201d Hill continued, \u201cused to go to black colleges.\u201d\n\nSo, too, top black students \u2014 in high school and elementary school, both. It was called, da dum, dum, dum: segregation.\n\nAnd it was deemed racist.\n\nAnd rightly so.\n\nYet this is precisely what Hill is calling for \u2014 segregation. Though in her world, it\u2019s \u201ccollectively\u201d decided, and it\u2019s decided by the blacks themselves, so therefore, it\u2019s automatically not the racist kind of segregation.\n\n\u201c[W]hat if a group of elite athletes collectively made the choice to attend HBCUs? Black athletes overall have never had as much power and influence as they do now,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis gives them leverage, if only they could be moved to use it. \u2026 The flight of black athletes to majority-white colleges has been devastating to HBCUs. \u2026 Today, most blue-chip recruits in football or basketball don\u2019t even consider attending black colleges.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s the free market for you.\n\nHistorically black universities have to learn to compete, same as \u2014 for lack of a better phrase \u2014 historically white universities.\n\n\u201cTo attract the best football and basketball players in the nation, HBCUs have to spend money to improve their facilities \u2014 but to generate the athletic revenue necessary to improve their facilities, the colleges need more of the best players,\u201d Hill wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s speaking the obvious.\n\nBut Hill meant it as a complaint.\n\nAnd she brought it to the forefront as a way of circling around to her main point: that blacks should boycott universities dominated by whites.\n\nHer point about larger, better funded universities scooping all the talent from smaller, lesser funded facilities is valid. It happens all the time \u2014 sometimes, tragically so. But it\u2019s the same point that can be made about the loss of Mom & Pop shops to Walmart; the loss of a company\u2019s top CEO to a headhunter and better opportunity; the loss of Pepsi\u2019s grocery shelf space to Coke\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s competition. That\u2019s capitalism. That\u2019s freedom and free choice. That\u2019s reaching for the dream \u2014 and winning.\n\nThat\u2019s not a black-white thing.\n\nWhat Hill wants? What she\u2019s recommending?\n\nIt\u2019s racist. Segregation is segregation is segregation, no matter which race is calling for it. And segregation based on skin color is, simply put: racist.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
