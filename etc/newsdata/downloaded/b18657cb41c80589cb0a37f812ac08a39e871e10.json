Other animals such as lions at Hwange National Park have been affected.\n\nThis is the worst drought in years in the southern African nation that also suffers from a collapsing economy. Massive food and water shortages have resulted.\n\nAs animals stray from Zimbabwe\u2019s wildlife parks they destroy crops and sometimes kill people, Farawo said, adding that more than 20 people have been killed this year alone.\n\nOvercrowding in Hwange contributes to the destruction of vegetation. The park can handle 15,000 elephants but currently has about 53,000, Farawo said.\n\nMeanwhile the drought is drying up water sources. The wildlife agency has been drilling wells as deep as 400 meters (yards) to find water for the animals.\n\n\u201cThe single biggest threat to our animals now is loss of habitat,\u201d Farawo said. \u201cWe have managed to significantly reduce poaching \u2026 we were losing hundreds of elephants in past years, but last year we only lost not more than 20 to poaching.\u201d\n\nZimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s largest elephant populations. It seeks to be allowed to hunt and export more of them to ease pressure on the animals\u2019 habitat and raise badly needed money for conservation.\n\nBotswana, which also has a large elephant population, this year lifted a ban on elephant hunting, saying the move would help reduce conflict between humans and animals and earn the country much-needed revenue.\n\nBut other countries that are parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora have successfully lobbied to limit the sales of elephants, to the dismay of some African countries that say they are struggling with large numbers of the animals.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At least 55 elephants have starved to death in the past two months in Zimbabwe's biggest national park as a serious drought forces animals to stray into nearby communities in search of food and water, authorities said on Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Farai Mutsaka"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/zimbabwe_dead_elephants_68276_c0-168-2562-1662_s1200x700.jpg?2093a668bd5db04245f6335e0f23bd1903bd1483", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
