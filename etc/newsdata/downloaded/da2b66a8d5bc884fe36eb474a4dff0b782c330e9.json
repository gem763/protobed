You don\u2019t see angry tweet storms about Republicans who voted for sanctions on Russia. The disagreement over Syria has stayed in that bucket.\u201d\u2026\n\nChip Saltsman, a Republican strategist based in Tennessee, said that conservative activists are abuzz over the Trump-versus-House Democrats impeachment skirmish. \u201cI have talked to nobody in the grass-roots world, GOP-wise, that brought up Syria,\u201d Saltsman said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to evangelical leaders who have. [But] to the base electorate right now, impeachment is so loud that Syria doesn\u2019t register yet.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cEvangelicals see this decision as a punch to the gut, but punches to the gut don\u2019t always have a lasting effect,\u201d said David Brody, chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network. He said the backlash over Syria amounts to \u201ca mini crisis\u201d for the White House, but added, \u201cThe president has done so much for evangelicals, in terms of judges and legislation, that this Syria decision isn\u2019t going to be the death knell.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Trumps-Syria-Decision-Tests-The-Bounds-Of-Republican-Support-As-He-Demands-Solidarity-On-Impeachment"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
