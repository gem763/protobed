Business Insider Intelligence\n\nProject Baseline began in 2017 with goals of making clinical research more accessible to participants and arriving at a quantifiable \"baseline\" for good health. The research project has since launched several clinical research projects in partnership with some of the largest names in healthcare, including: Pfizer, Mayo Clinic, Novartis, the American Heart Association, and Stanford Medicine.\n\nThe partnership could enable Verily to incorporate data on genetic risk factors into its various clinical studies, leading to a more in-depth and holistic understanding of health. It's unclear exactly how information gleaned from Color's genetic tests will be leveraged in Project Baseline studies, but it's possible that future research initiatives may choose to examine how genetic risk factors affect health outcomes alongside patients' behavior and medical history.\n\nAnd allowing Project Baseline members access to genetic testing and personalized health advice may improve participant engagement with the particular research program they're involved in and with the Project Baseline platform overall, which is critical given that 86% of clinical trials fail to hit their participation goals.\n\nWe caught up with Color CEO Othman Laraki to discuss how a Verily-Color tie up furthers Color's goals for a genetic future of healthcare \u2014 below are some key takeaways from our conversation:\n\nWe think Color will benefit from the exposure that comes when partnering with a Google-affiliated business, and more users should facilitate stronger population health insights. In the last two months, Color has scored massive partnerships with NIH and its All of Us program and now Verily: two major names in healthcare. And each new project raises not just Color's profile, but that of the genetic testing field as a whole, according to Laraki.\n\nLaraki pointed out that the idea of every home having a personal computer was once considered crazy \u2014 and that one day it may be the case that genetic data is as commonplace in healthcare as computers are in the home. But this might only be possible if far-reaching research programs like All of Us and Project Baseline can successfully attract participants and deliver actionable results.\n\nColor has become a standout player in genetic testing by focusing on large-scale population health projects \u2014 which I (Zach) think is a smart business model in the face of a potential slowdown in the direct-to-consumer genetic testing market. \"In some ways, using a doctor's time to measure your height and have them listen to your heartbeat is almost more expensive now than getting a complete genomic profile,\" says Laraki.\n\nAnd the fact that genetic testing is becoming cheaper for consumers could be part of why we're seeing so much interest from providers and research firms in population-level genetic health research: MIT Technology Review now estimates that over 100 million people globally will have taken an at-home genetic test by 2021, up from the 26 million consumers at the beginning of 2019, for example.\n\nWith industry leaders like Illumina expressing concerns around a potential slowdown for the direct-to-consumer genetic testing market, a model that's given rise to 23andMe and Ancestry \u2014 the two biggest names in genetic testing today \u2014 I think that Color's model will conversely gain traction as providers are increasingly becoming interested in moving beyond individual patient results and searching for the root cause of conditions affecting their communities.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
