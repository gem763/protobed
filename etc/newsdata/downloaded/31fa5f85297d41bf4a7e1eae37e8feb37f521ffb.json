(AP) - With Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon and the front office at an impasse over a new contract, coach Anthony Lynn and his players are focused on another type of business - preparing for the opener Sunday against Indianapolis.\n\nRunning backs Austin Ekeler and Justin Jackson will be under the microscope this week even though Gordon has been absent since the start of training camp. Ekeler and Jackson might be unknown to some fans - especially those trying to make their fantasy football rosters - but quarterback Philip Rivers doesn\u2019t have any doubts about what they can do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any unknown there. We\u2019ve seen them in action and we know what they can do,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe can see the tape and go off how many days of work we put in together to know they are capable of moving the ball.\u201d\n\nRivers said he has had some communication with Gordon, but nothing beyond that. If the Chargers struggle out of the gate, that might change for everyone involved.\n\nFor now, though, they are content to see how far Ekeler and Jackson can perform after both showed flashes last season.\n\nEkeler has shown he is a good complementary back when paired with Gordon. He averaged 5.3 yards per carry last season and had 958 yards from scrimmage. Ekeler has 11 touchdowns the past two seasons, with six coming on receptions.\n\nEkeler though has struggled when being counted on as the main back. He averaged only 3.3 yards per carry in the three games he started when Gordon was injured last season.\n\nThe focus for Ekeler this week has been honing in on blitz pickup and refining technique.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no added pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cMy approach has been the same for two years - put me a spot where I know this is my role and it is up to me to execute.\u201d\n\nJackson is slightly smaller than Gordon, but is more consistent on inside runs than Ekeler. He had three games of 50 yards or more, including 58 yards on 16 carries in a Week 15 start at Kansas City.\n\nJackson, a seventh-round pick last year, says he is looking forward to taking advantage of another opportunity.\n\n\u201cAustin and I are dynamic and have some uniqueness,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all love Melvin but you have to go out there and play your game and not be someone else.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles will face an Indianapolis run defense that was eighth in the league last season (101.6 yards per game) and hasn\u2019t allowed a 100-yard rusher in its last 18-regular season games. The Colts allowed four running backs to gain 122 yards or more two years ago but none last year.\n\nIndianapolis defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus said he doesn\u2019t think Gordon\u2019s absence will affect the Chargers offense.\n\n\u201cIf you watch when he wasn\u2019t in there last year and their other guys were in there I think they ran the same offense, the same types of runs and the same patterns. It looked like the same operation to me so I think it\u2019s really the same,\u201d he said.\n\nOffensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt acknowledged there would be a bigger sense of the unknown if Ekeler and Jackson had not played in big games at Pittsburgh and Kansas City last year. He is also hoping that the Chargers can remain balanced on offense, which is a big reason why they won 12 games and made the playoffs last season.\n\n\u201cI think that we, obviously, work very hard to make sure that we\u2019re consistent with running the football and that we want to keep doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at what some of the runs that Austin and Justin had last year, you would think they have the chance to do that. That will be judged, I guess, over the course of time, but we certainly feel good about those guys.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon and the front office at an impasse over a new contract, coach Anthony Lynn and his players are focused on another type of business - preparing for the opener Sunday against Indianapolis.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/25/seahawks_chargers_football_65097_c0-552-1204-1253_s1770x1032.jpg?7b03832206e76b6cbabeabab6b2cdc3ef4ed91fd"}
