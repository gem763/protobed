She was rushed to hospital but died days later.\n\nThe assistant coroner for central and southeast Kent, Bina Patel, said: \"She died of pulmonary thromboembolism, recognised risk of the oral contraceptive pill prescribed for longstanding menorrhagia.\"\n\nShe recorded a narrative conclusion at Maidstone Coroner's Court.\n\nMenorrhagia is abnormally heavy bleeding during menstruation.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBut pulmonary thromboembolism happens when a clump of material, most often a blood clot, gets wedged into the artery in the lungs.\n\nTypically, chest pain and difficulty breathing are signs of pulmonary thromboembolism.\n\nMrs Walton's husband, Jeremy Walton, said: \"My wife was taken away very suddenly and before her time.\n\n\"She is sorely missed by me and her two sons Nathan and Jeremy James.\n\n\"While we cannot bring her back, we hope that the conclusion of the inquest highlights to others the risks associated with taking the combined oral contraceptive pill, and more importantly how these risks can differ in severity from person to person.\"\n\nThe 23-day inquest in Maidstone, Kent, which ended last month, heard the cleaner visited her locum GP Dr Wain at the town's Market Place Surgery last May.\n\nBut she collapsed two months later and was rushed to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother Hospital in Margate.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAnd Ms Walton died on July 26, 2018 as a result of cardiorespiratory failure caused by pulmonary thromboembolism, the obstruction of a blood vessel.\n\nBut Dr Alastair Bint, an independent GP expert, was critical of Dr Wain's decision. He told the hearing of the risk of blood clot as being the single biggest risk of the combined oral contraceptive pill and cited two sources of guidance available to GPs.\n\nThe Medical Defence Union (MDU), representing Dr Wain at the inquest, said it was reasonable for Dr Wain to prescribe Yasmin because the benefits of the pill outweighed the risk of Mrs Walton developing a blood clot.\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Jenny Waight, the lawyer at Thomson Snell & Passmore, said: \"The evidence of the independent expert in this case was that Yasmin was the combined oral contraceptive pill with the highest risk of blood clot and that it should not have been prescribed to Mrs Walton.\n\n\"I hope the inquest's conclusion brings closure for our client and his family and goes some way in raising awareness of the associated risks of taking the combined oral contraceptive pill.\"", "description": "Susan Walton was prescribed with a contraceptive pill by doctors in Maidstone, Kent, but collapsed suddenly", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Metro News", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20550416.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-BLPP_CHP_PMI_15893JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
