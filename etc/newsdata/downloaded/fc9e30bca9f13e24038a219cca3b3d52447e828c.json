Employment in the private sector surged by 298,000 for the month, with goods producers adding 106,000, ADP and Moody\u2019s Analytics said. Construction jobs swelled by 66,000 and manufacturing added 32,000. The total shattered market expectations of 190,000, according to economists surveyed by ADP. \u201cFebruary proved to be an incredibly strong month for employment with increases we have not seen in years,\u201d Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said in a statement. In addition to the construction and manufacturing positions, mining and natural resources also contributed 8,000 to the total. Trump has promised to restore mining jobs as well. The year is off to a sizzling start for job creation, according to the ADP counts. January added 261,000 positions, a number that was revised upward from the originally reported 246,000. \u201cConfidence is playing a large role,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, told CNBC. \u201cBusinesses are anticipating a lot of good stuff \u2014 tax cuts, less regulation. They are hiring more aggressively.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoom, baby, boom.\n\nForecast for \u2018A Day Without a Woman\u2019: Closed Schools, Less Traffic\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Schools decided to close today for \u201cA Day Without a Woman,\u201d giving parents less than 24 hours notice.\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Public Schools have announced they will close schools on Wednesday after 1,700 teachers and nearly a third of their transportation staff requested for the day off in observance of International Women\u2019s Day and \u201cA Day Without a Woman\u201d protest. Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools CEO Dr. Kevin Maxwell said in a statement: \u201cThroughout Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools, a high number of school-based and support staff have requested leave for Wednesday, March 8. As of 5:30 p.m., approximately 1,700 teachers and 30 percent of transportation staff have requested leave. We cannot transport students and provide safe, productive learning environments without adequate staff. As a result, schools will be closed tomorrow for students. We apologize for the inconvenience this will surely cause to many families.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m starting to doubt the school district\u2019s slogan. I can remember when only meteorological snowflakes could shut down D.C.-area schools.\n\nOver on the home page, I have a piece that most readers can guess is fueled by personal experience. I used to live in \u201cYuppie Acres\u201d \u2013 I guess I can reveal now that it was the Cameron Station neighborhood in Alexandria, Virginia. My older son had a wonderful experience with the local public elementary school, Samuel Tucker Elementary. But my wife and I figured out quickly that the public schools in Alexandria weren\u2019t that great at the middle school level and the city\u2019s lone public high school, T.C. Williams, ranked 79th out of 190 high schools in the region \u2013 not bad, but nowhere near the level you would expect considering the hefty property taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re wealthy enough in Alexandria, you eventually send your kids to one of the city\u2019s many excellent, but extremely expensive, private schools. (Episcopal High School, which was John McCain\u2019s high school, looks like a college campus. The annual fee is $54,250.)\n\nOr you do what we did, and you move across the border to Arlington or Fairfax County, districts that offer some of the best public schools in the country. Here in \u201cAuthenticity Woods,\u201d we\u2019re thrilled with our sons\u2019 local elementary school, and we notice many of our neighbors from Yuppie Acres have made the same trek.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs laid out in my piece, Alexandria public schools have real problems: test scores below the state average, discipline and crime issues, a school that lost accreditation, and a considerable number of parents voting with their feet and taking their kids out of the school system. It is hard to argue that this is a funding issue; the district spends $16,999 per student, according to the latest statistics. (As of 2014, the Virginia statewide average was $10,973 per student.) Class sizes in Alexandria are small, averaging 18 students in elementary school, 20 in middle school, and 22 in high school.\n\nLocal taxes are fairly high. The Alexandria property tax on real estate is $1.043 per $100 of assessed value; the Virginia average tax rate is $0.74 per $100. The personal property tax rate on vehicles in Alexandria is fairly high at $5 per $100 of assessed value, and there is a one percent sales tax on retail purchases and meals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you think about the resources available to Alexandria as a city, the performance of the schools looks less disappointing than disgraceful.\n\nIn light of all this, \u201csexism\u201d seems like an amorphous problem for the city\u2019s teachers and educational staff to spend a day addressing considering the tangible, real-life problems in front of them every weekday.\n\nThey have already succeeded in blowing up the plans of working parents in Alexandria, who now have two days notice to find all-day child care or take an involuntary day off from work. The school staffers have really managed to send a signal to the oppressive patriarchy of Alexandria, where Hillary Clinton won 76 percent of the vote.\n\nThe Hyping of Chelsea Clinton Continues\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere really is an effort going on to persuade us that Chelsea Clinton is an important voice on the national political scene, isn\u2019t there? Neontaster notices that The Hill newspaper has tweeted about Chelsea Clinton 70 times since the beginning of the year.\n\nPolitico declares that she \u201clets loose on Twitter\u201d showcasing \u201ca spicy, sarcastic online personality.\u201d CNN concurs, \u201cChelsea Clinton embraces her Twitter sass.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this news? Why should we care? She\u2019s the daughter of a president and former presidential candidate. Despite the insistence of the Clinton circle that she\u2019s earned all of her jobs on her own merits, we have no evidence that she\u2019s done anything in life that wasn\u2019t driven by her famous name and parents. She made $600,000 per year to interview the Geico Gecko for NBC News. She is the embodiment of inherited privilege, making insanely high speaking fees simply for being who she is. When are we allowed to stop going along with this media assertion that she\u2019s an enthralling leader who just happens to have famous parents?\n\nShe writes for the BBC that \u201cAmerica is suffering from an opioid epidemic.\u201d Aren\u2019t we glad she\u2019s here to inform us about these things? She\u2019s not a doctor. She\u2019s not an addiction expert. Her claim to expertise on the subject is the \u201cClinton Foundation\u2019s work with researchers at Johns Hopkins University to study the opioid epidemic.\u201d Yet instead of getting someone who actually studies the issue for the university, BBC invites Chelsea Clinton to weigh in on the subject. Why?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times interviews her about her favorite books. Why? It\u2019s as if a vast swath of the media has decided she must be considered fascinating and thought-provoking, regardless of whether she actually fascinates or provokes thoughts.\n\nMichael Sainato argues this relentless, hard-to-justify coverage represents the Clintons reestablishing themselves as the true power brokers in the Democratic party, even after Hillary\u2019s stunning defeat in the presidential election.\n\nThis appearance and the constant coverage of her tweets provide Chelsea Clinton with the cult-like coverage necessary to gain political power while avoiding political risk. This coverage also inadvertently benefits Hillary Clinton, who cannot make such appearances without garnering negative coverage for exercising the same expediency. With Chelsea Clinton, the Clinton brand is still able to receive praise and admiration from the elite mainstream media. Any resistance to Trump offered from the Clintons\u2014whether it\u2019s from Bill, Hillary, or Chelsea\u2014is not resistance at all. Rather, it\u2019s the Democratic establishment\u2019s attempt to oppose Trump while they reaffirm their power and subvert reform within the party. As long as a Clinton \u201cresists\u201d on behalf of the Democratic Party, there is little to no opportunity for newcomers on the left to emerge. Chelsea Clinton\u2019s manufactured role as a resistance spokesperson allows the \u201cresistance\u201d to Trump to remain in the control of the Democratic establishment and prevents progressives from reforming the Democratic Party to fight on behalf of working and middle class Americans.\n\nThe family dynasty must live on.\n\nADDENDA: Andy McCarthy sorts through the statements of former Director of James Clapper:\n\nBear in mind that while the media and Democrats are now using Clapper\u2019s statements to try to downplay Obama-administration investigation efforts against Trump associates, they were very content for the last four months to have Americans believe an aggressive investigation was underway. As I explained in yesterday\u2019s column, fueling the public perception that Trump and his campaign were under investigation has been essential to propping up the false narrative of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Putin regime to \u201chack the election.\u201d", "description": "Good economic numbers for Trump; \u2018A Day Without a Woman\u2019 leads to school closures; the media hypes Chelsea Clinton.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
