Expansion joints connect bridge spans and allow the structure to expand and contract as the air heats or cools.\n\nWhen joints become clogged, they prevent the bridge from expanding normally in response to higher temperatures. The researchers reasoned that higher average temperatures in the future, not accounted for when such bridges were first built, could lead to unforeseen thermal stress.\n\nHeat stress can cause buckling and cracking, which are exacerbated by both bending from the weight of lorries and cars, and axial loading from the expansion restriction. The study is the first to quantify the impact of potential temperature changes in conjunction with normal expected clogging of expansion joints.\n\nThe researchers considered four different seasonal scenarios for temperature at the time of each bridge\u2019s construction, along with projected average temperatures for the years 2040, 2060, 2080 and 2100.\n\nThe projected temperature rises are the \u201cradiative concentration pathway\u201d greenhouse gas warming scenarios adopted by the International Panel on Climate Change in 2014.\n\nResults indicate that bridges located in the northern portion of the United States, including the Northern Rockies and Plains, Northwest and Upper Midwest, are the most vulnerable to more pronounced increases in temperatures.\n\nLess susceptible regions were the southeast and northeast.\n\nThe engineers\u2019 aim was to rank bridges in order of needed maintenance after accounting for the new normal of climate change.\n\nThey found that current temperature extremes aren\u2019t likely to cause severe problems, however, they are getting closer to reaching levels which could cause catastrophic failures.\n\nThey say one in four bridges are at risk of failing by 2040, and by 2060 this rises to 28 per cent. By 2080 just under 50 per cent of bridges were deemed a risk, and almost all studied are predicted to have failed by the end of the century if no interventions are made.\n\n\u201cWe as engineers must start to look beyond what we have initially been taught on how to analyse systems and start to think about what climate change is going to do to our understanding of component-level behaviour and system-level performance,\u201d Dr Mahmoud said.\n\n\u201cNeglecting possible future climate change can jeopardize the integrity of many US bridges.\n\n\u201cEfficient maintenance to keep the expansion joints functional, on a regular basis, is vital to avoid undesirable thermal demands that will potentially be magnified due to climate change,\u201d the study says.\n\nThe research is published in the journal Plos One.", "description": "A changing climate takes a physical toll on infrastructure built with more predictable weather patterns in mind.
