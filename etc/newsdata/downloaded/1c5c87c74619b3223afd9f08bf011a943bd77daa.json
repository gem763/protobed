A separate jury awarded Murray $1.75 million in actual damages in 2015 on his claims the drug caused him to develop female breasts. That award later was cut to $680,000 under Maryland law.\n\nThe verdict, which is unlikely to be upheld on appeal, may nonetheless sound an ominous warning for J&J since the company still faces more than 13,000 suits over its Risperdal marketing and failure to warn teens about its health risks, according to the company\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. More than 7,000 of those cases are pending in state court in Philadelphia, according to court records.\n\nGiven the number of trials J&J and Janssen still face in Philadelphia, the $8 billion verdict may prompt consideration of setting up a global settlement of the Risperdal litigation, said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who teaches about mass torts. The company already has settled some cases, he noted.\n\n\u201cThat type of punitive-damage award will encourage more plaintiffs and their counsel to pursue more cases vigorously,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may make sense to get out now.\u201d\n\nJ&J officials vowed to appeal the ruling and said the punitive award was excessive compared to the actual-damage figure. The drugmaker also faulted a judge\u2019s refusal to allow it to present mitigating evidence about Janssen\u2019s handling of the drug.\n\n\u201cThis decision is inconsistent with multiple determinations outside of Philadelphia regarding the adequacy of Risperdal\u2019s labeling, the medicine\u2019s efficacy, and findings in support of the company,\u201d Ernie Knewitz, a J&J spokesman, said in an interview.\n\nJ&J shares fell $3.11, or 2.4%, to $128.73 in premarket trading on Wednesday. The company\u2019s shares have been under pressure in recent months because of litigation woes spawned by suits alleging its iconic Baby Powder is causing various types of cancers. J&J is also facing numerous legal claims over its alleged role in the U.S. opioid addiction and overdose crisis.\n\n\u201cThis jury resoundingly told J&J that its actions were deliberate and malicious,\u201d Tom Kline and Jason Itkin, two of Murray\u2019s lawyers, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe conduct the jury saw in the courtroom was clear and convincing that J&J disregarded the safety of children.\u201d Stephen Sheller, another of Murray\u2019s lawyers, added in an interview that the verdict shows that J&J \u201ccan\u2019t get away with this kind of conduct anymore.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs contend J&J and Janssen illegally marketed Risperdal to youngsters prior to 2007, when U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials approved its use for teens diagnosed with autism. The companies also face allegations they hid the risk the drug could cause breast development to protect billions of dollars in profits.\n\nIn 2013, J&J agreed to pay $2.2 billion to resolve criminal and civil probes into allegations that it illegally marketed the drug to children and the elderly. The settlement, which also includes marketing claims about two other J&J drugs, was one of the largest U.S. health-fraud penalties in history.\n\nA Pennsylvania Superior Court ruling in 2018 cleared the way for punitive damages to be considered in Risperdal cases tried in the state. Some juries had been improperly barred from weighing such damages in the past, the court concluded.\n\nThe $8 billion verdict is four times the size of the next-largest U.S. award so far this year. In May, a California jury awarded a couple $2.055 billion in compensatory and punitive damages over claims they got cancer from exposure to Bayer AG\u2019s Roundup weed-killer. That award was later cut to $86.7 million.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Janssen unit was hit with an $8 billion punitive-damages verdict -- the largest jury award in the U.S. this year -- over its alleged mishandling of an anti-psychotic drug blamed for causing adolescent boys to grow female-sized breasts.A state court jury in Philadelphia", "authors": ["Jef Feeley", "Riley Griffin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dvmVrdCNTJaWiTYpQBe.MA--~B/aD0yMDE0O3c9Mjk2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/08f1aec81fbe1cc29243fe70f3594f00", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
