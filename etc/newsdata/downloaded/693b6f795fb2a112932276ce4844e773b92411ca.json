Everybody was looking forward to it. I think everybody was ready. And you can\u2019t plan for that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, no one saw it coming.\n\nThen again, maybe they should have.\n\nAfter all, this was an Atlanta team and a big-time game.\n\nThat\u2019s rarely a good combination.\n\n\u201cEverything went wrong,\u201d said Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman, who made a key error that helped open the floodgates in Wednesday night\u2019s debacle.\n\nTo be fair, the A-T-L has managed two major professional championships: the Braves in the World Series way back in 1995 and soccer\u2019s Atlanta United, which captured the MLS Cup title last December.\n\nBut the failures far outweigh those rare successes.\n\nThe NFL Falcons, who\u2019ve been around since 1966, have managed just two Super Bowl appearances - and both ended badly.\n\nVery, very badly.\n\nDuring the 1998 season, a team known affectionately as the \u201cDirty Birds\u201d reached the title game against John Elway and the Denver Broncos. Unfortunately for the Falcons, one of their most respected players, Eugene Robinson, was arrested the night before the big game on charges that he solicited an undercover police officer for sex. Thoroughly distracted, Robinson was beaten for a long touchdown and the Falcons staggered to a 34-19 loss.\n\nOf course, that was nothing compared to the Falcons\u2019 most recent Super Bowl appearance. Three seasons ago, Atlanta held a 28-3 lead over the mighty New England Patriots late in the third quarter. But Tom Brady led a furious comeback that culminated with the first overtime in the game\u2019s history.\n\nOf course, the Patriots won the OT coin toss and drove the length of the field for a 34-28 victory.\n\nThe NBA Hawks have never even reached the finals, but at least they\u2019re still around. Atlanta\u2019s two NHL teams both moved to Canada due to financial problems - the Flames going to Calgary in 1980, the Thrashers following suit in 2011 by relocating to Winnipeg. Neither franchise won a single playoff series.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget college football\u2019s Georgia Bulldogs, who are essentially an Atlanta team.\n\nThey were dealt excruciating losses the last two seasons by Alabama, which rallied from a pair of 13-point deficits to win the 2018 national championship game with a 41-yard touchdown pass in overtime, and then pulled off another comeback in last season\u2019s Southeastern Conference title game to deny the Bulldogs a return trip to the national playoff.\n\nBoth games were held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, in the shadow of the Atlanta skyline.\n\nWhen it comes to postseason disappointment, no one can match the Braves.\n\nThe franchise is well known for its record 14 straight division titles from 1999 through 2005, but just as much for having collected only one World Series title with all those playoff appearances. The most bitter loss came a year after its biggest triumph: the Braves easily won the first two games of the \u201896 Series at Yankee Stadium and were up 6-0 in Game 4, seemingly assured of building a 3-1 lead.\n\nBut New York\u2019s Jim Leyritz tied the game with a three-run homer, the Yankees won in extra innings and would go on to take the title, four games to two.\n\nThe Braves have never come so close again to winning a title.\n\nEven worse, they\u2019ve now lost 10 straight playoff rounds since their last triumph in the 2001 NLDS, tying the ignominious record for postseason failure set by the Chicago Cubs from 1908 to 2003. Rubbing even more salt in the wound, eight of those series setbacks have ended with a loss on Atlanta\u2019s home field.\n\nIt happened again Wednesday. The Cardinals celebrated in the middle of the field before gathering on the pitcher\u2019s mound to pose for a triumphant picture with the Braves logo serving as a backdrop on the enormous center-field video board.\n\n\u201cI think it was more of a shock than anything,\u201d Braves third baseman Josh Donaldson said. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect something like that to happen, especially with how well we played all season.\u201d\n\nHe might as well have been speaking for the entire city.\n\nThen again, it wasn\u2019t really a surprise.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football coverage: www.collegefootball.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At this point, Atlanta sports fans should be numb to the disappointment.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/nlds_cardinals_braves_baseball_72027_c0-312-2800-1944_s1770x1032.jpg?cebf19e74cf6277168c3771e3d15789e67c7d848", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
