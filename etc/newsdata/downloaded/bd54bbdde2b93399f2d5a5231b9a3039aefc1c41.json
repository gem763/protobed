But a Hong Konger who travels to the country can still be subject to a justice system that\u2019s grown increasingly opaque and arbitrary under President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn Xi\u2019s China, forced disappearances and reports of torture have led to hollow confessions, apologies to the state, and arbitrary charges that \u2014 at least, in the case of the Australian writer Yang Hengjun \u2014 could come with the death penalty. Under Xi, no one is out of bounds: not even the president of a high-profile organization like Interpol or the country\u2019s highest-paid actress, fresh off a trip to Cannes.\n\nJust as Xi came into power in 2013, China expanded a law that had once let police detain suspects at home, to allow them to detain a suspect anywhere. That meant no perp walk to a jail, no cameras, and no fellow prisoners. It essentially legalized solitary confinement. The law also gave police with a raft of excuses not to notify a suspect\u2019s family or lawyer. Thus, the disappearances.\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry has responded to allegations of unjust imprisonment by saying \u201ceverything in China is done in accordance with the law.\u201d Beijing has denied allegations of torture in the past.\n\nLast year, Xi\u2019s government went further, amending the constitution to create a new branch of government under the Orwellian title, the National Supervision Commission. Ostensibly charged with investigating bribery and corruption, it essentially empowered police to pick up \u201canyone that they would want,\u201d says the human rights advocate, Michael Caster.\n\nIn 2016, Caster co-founded Safeguard Defenders, a human rights NGO that\u2019s been advocating for victims and tracking disappearances. He spoke with VICE News Tonight about how Xi\u2019s changed the justice system, and why Xi doesn\u2019t just have his eye on Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nThis segment originally aired August 28, 2019, on VICE News Tonight on HBO.", "description": "Forced disappearances and reports of torture mark President Xi Jinping's justice record.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6febce30aa08000805ff95/lede/1567617521444-chinad.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
