He had never before won a five-set match and Nadal had lost only twice from two sets up in his career.\n\nNadal\u2019s delaying tactics were irking the Russian but he fashioned two break points, then a third, only for Nadal to escape again.\n\nWhen Nadal eked out a break point of his own at 2-2, Medvedev aced him. But when Nadal created another, a double-handed backhand putting him back in control. Still the drama continued.\n\nNadal broke again but, serving for the match, he was given a second time violation by umpire Ali Nili and docked a serve at break point down, and promptly sent his second serve wide. Umpiring controversy is not confined to Serena Williams here, it seems.\n\nMedvedev saved two match points on serve but when Nadal had the ball in his hand again he finally got over the line, a long Medvedev return bringing to an end a truly remarkable final.\n\nAn exhausted Nadal was in tears as he sat in his chair waiting for the post-match presentations.\n\nHe admitted: \u201cIt\u2019s been one of the most emotional nights in my tennis career.\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing final, since I had the match under control more or less. Tonight everybody saw why he is number four in the world.\n\n\u201cThe way he was able to fight, to change the rhythm of the match, was incredible.\u201d\n\nMedvedev addressed his new admirers. He had goaded them after his controversial win over Feliciano Lopez, saying \u201cI want all of you to know, when you sleep tonight, that I won because of you.\u201d\n\nThis time he said: \u201cI want to talk about you guys. Earlier I said it in a bad way, now I mean it in a good way. It\u2019s because of your energy I\u2019m here in the final.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cCongratulations to Rafa, 19 grand slams is unbelievable, outrageous.\n\n\u201cI was looking at the screen when they were showing number one, number two, number 19, and I was like, \u2018if I won, what would they show?\u2019\n\n\u201cIn the third set, to be honest, I was already thinking about what do I say in the speech, it\u2019s going to be in 20 minutes. So I had to fight for every ball and see how far it goes.\u201d\n\n\u200bPA", "description": "Rafael Nadal overcame Daniil Medvedev in five breathtaking sets to claim his 19th grand slam title at the US Open.
