We need a legally operative solution in the withdrawal agreement which fully responds to each one of the problems.\"\n\nHe appeared to reject UK proposals to give the Stormont Assembly in Northern Ireland a say over how much it conforms with EU customs rules and diverges from Britain while the UK remained in any backstop arrangement.\n\nHe said there were already provisions in the current agreement giving the UK a degree of control over the backstop's \"application\".\n\n\"It is up to the UK government to ensure the support of the Northern Irish institutions for the withdrawal agreement that would be signed on behalf of the whole of the UK,\" he said.\n\n'Caring nanny'\n\nHe said any agreement would have to include specific guarantees on cross-border food safety and animal health to protect Irish citizens and businesses in the rest of the EU.\n\nHe also indicted the success of a future economic relationship would depend on the EU receiving guarantees on social, environmental and competition regulations.\n\nAnd MEP Guy Verhofstadt, the Parliament's Brexit spokesman, called on the UK to give all EU nationals living in the country the automatic right to remain after Brexit.\n\nRather than channelling the \"angry Hulk\" - a reference to Mr Johnson's recent comparison of the UK to the Incredible Hulk - he said the PM should adopt the persona of a \"caring nanny\", such as Mrs Doubtfire, and show generosity to the three million EU nationals in the UK.\n\nBut Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it was clear the UK and EU were paving the way for an agreement next month which would be portrayed as a \"victory\" for both sides.\n\nEven without the backstop, he said the deal on the table would be \"bad\" for the UK as it would see it \"trapped in EU rules and under the auspices of the European Court\".\n\nHe also criticised they way Mr Johnson was treated during a visit to Luxembourg last week.\n\nHe said the country's \"pipsqueak\" leader Xavier Bettel had \"ritually humiliated\" his counterpart by appearing at a press conference without him and berating his Brexit policy.", "description": "The EU's chief negotiator says it is \"not enough\" for the UK to say what it does not want.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2E1D/production/_108850811_mediaitem108850479.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
