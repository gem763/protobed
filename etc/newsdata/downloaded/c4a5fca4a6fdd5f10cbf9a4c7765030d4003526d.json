That effort sought to pressure Mr. Zelensky\u2019s government to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to challenge Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Perry\u2019s trip raised questions about whether he was seeking to provide certain Americans help in gaining a foothold in the Ukrainian energy business at a time when the new Ukrainian government was looking to the United States for signals of support in its simmering conflict with Russia.", "description": "The energy secretary pushed for changes at Naftogaz with Ukraine\u2019s new president as President Trump sought inquiries into political opponents.", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
