In fact, it has now become an even safer place to come because of the initiatives.\u201d\n\nBernstein also specifically addressed reports that tainted alcohol led to the deaths, noting that if there were a problem with alcohol there would be far more reports of deaths.\n\n\u201cIf it was alcohol people would be dropping like flies,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cIt is not alcohol.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year there were multiple high-profile cases involving American tourists who died while staying in the Dominican Republic. Seven deaths have been attributed to tourists becoming ill and dying of health-related issues. The FBI is still conducting toxicology tests in three specific cases and has not yet released the results.\n\nAccording to the State Department, there has been no evidence of foul play and no sign that the deaths are connected.\n\nBefore the measures were announced, Garcia took the time to lambast the news media, saying the coverage of the deaths of the American tourists was overblown and aimed to damage the Dominican Republic\u2019s stellar reputation as a \u201cmodel\u201d tourist country.\n\nThe State Dept. confirmed that in 2018, 13 U.S. citizens died while traveling to the Dominican Republic; the number was 17 in 2017. More than 2.7 million U.S. tourists visited the island in 2017, making the island the fourth-most popular travel destination for Americans.\n\nGarcia later said \u201cthe damage is done\u201d from the slew of reports that focused on the island, but that Dominican Republic officials are still committed to fixing their image, with their main focus now being on the truth.\n\nAccording to InSight Crime\u2019s 2018 Homicide Round-Up, statistics show that the Dominican Republic recorded 10.4 homicides per 100,000 people \u2013\u2013 compared to 81.4 in Venezuela, 25 in Mexico and 11.7 in Costa Rica.", "description": "'American tourists should feel safe and secure,' an official said", "authors": ["Gina Martinez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gtSCaEadz9BbEy4ZYphRIQ--~B/aD0zMDI0O3c9NDAzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/a1668c40aab6e01ad57295209bed2149", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
