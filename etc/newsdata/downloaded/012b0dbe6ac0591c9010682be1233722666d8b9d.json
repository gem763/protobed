Britain's FTSE 100 index, which was up 0.3% at the closing bell, was down 5.3% in August in its worst monthly fall since August 2015.\n\nBucking Friday's trend were Italian stocks, which fell on the back of new political developments in the country. Luigi Di Maio, leader of Italy's Five-Star Movement, said on Friday his party would only enter a coalition with opposition PD if it agreed to a string of policy demands, denting hopes that some political stability would soon be restored in Rome.\n\nItaly's FTSE MIB was more than 0.3% lower during afternoon deals, with Banco BPM slumping to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 on a 3% loss.\n\nMore broadly, stocks worldwide are experiencing a reprieve after the Chinese Ministry of Commerce on Thursday indicated that it would not escalate the trade war with Washington, urging negotiation and collaboration in pursuit of a \"calm\" resolution.\n\nStocks on Wall Street turned negative on Friday, erasing earlier gains, with the Nasdaq shedding 0.4% in late morning trade.\n\nBack in Europe, investors continued to monitor the fallout from U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of parliament. The main opposition Labour party said on Thursday that it would trigger an emergency debate in parliament next week, in a bid to stop Johnson taking Britain out of the European Union without a withdrawal deal on October 31.\n\nThe no-deal scenario is widely opposed in the British parliament, and the elevated risk of it becoming reality has sent sterling lower.", "description": "European stocks closed higher on Friday after China struck an accommodating tone over its trade war with the U.S., while British opposition lawmakers plan to trigger an emergency debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor Elliot Smith", "Chloe Taylor", "Elliot Smith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103278825-trader.jpg?v=1529470365"}
