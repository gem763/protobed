Rather than lay off employees who could be hard to replace, some firms reduced worker hours instead.\n\nIn the Boston region, \"signs of slowing have become more widespread,\" while growth in the New York area \"slowed to a subdued pace.\"\n\nConditions improved in the Chicago and St. Louis regions.\n\nThe early fallout from a recent nationwide strike by UAW workers at General Motors plants \"was limited,\" the Fed said.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] Less than stellar US growth in recent weeks has caused many businesses to revise their outlooks and they now expect activity to weaken, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. .
