(AP) - A Mississippi community college says football team videos that cost thousands of dollars violated copyright law and college policy, but the process has been reformed to make the videos legal and filter out profanity.\n\nEast Mississippi Community College President Scott Alsobrooks tells The Commercial Dispatch of Columbus that the Scooba-based college didn\u2019t have copyright permission to weave clips from movies, television shows and rap videos in with football highlights in \u201chype\u201d videos shown to the college\u2019s nationally prominent football team in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly not stuff that should have been produced (by staff or paid contractors) and shown to our students,\u201d Alsobrooks said. \u201cIt was inappropriate, and we\u2019re still trying to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nEast Mississippi\u2019s football team drew national notice through the Netflix documentary series \u201cLast Chance U.\u201d The first two seasons of the series chronicled the Lions\u2019 on-field success, as well as struggles of players to maintain academic eligibility and transfer to big-time college programs.\n\nHowever, the college has been running a deficit and spending its reserves dry in recent years in part because it\u2019s under pressure from heavy athletic spending, as The Dispatch has reported, leading Alsobrooks to cut budgets after he was hired in January.\n\nThe newspaper viewed the motivational videos in August at a lawyer\u2019s office. Song lyrics, which are unedited, include racial slurs \u2014 such as dozens of uses of the N-word \u2014 and dozens of instances of graphic profanity, such as the F-word. Lyrics also reference multiple sexual acts, selling and using drugs, and one song specifically lists multiple gangs by name. In some highlight videos, the sound of a gunshot is synced with defensive players making a big hit.\n\nThe college has refused to release copies, citing copyright problems. The newspaper is filing a public records complaint against East Mississippi with the Mississippi Ethics Commission to obtain the videos.\n\nEast Mississippi paid one contractor more than $3,000 for production work in 2018, and paid less to others. Before then, college employees made the videos.\n\nAlsobrooks said he understands the videos were shown only to the team during private meetings the night before each game during football season. They were meant for motivation. School officials also indicated similar hype videos were made for several seasons prior to 2016.\n\nThe college\u2019s own policy prohibits college personnel or contractors from \u201cviewing, storing, or distributing obscene, pornographic, or objectionable material,\u201d among other things. It also explicitly addresses adherence to copyright law and licensing requirements.\n\nAlsobrooks said, in his opinion, the hype videos through 2018 violated that policy. This season, he said, all video material shown follows copyright law and uses non-profane \u201cradio edits\u201d of songs.\n\n\u201cWe had policies that were broken and we\u2019ve had to deal with that,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 I think this started innocently enough, but (videography) people got better at it, and nobody put their foot on the brake as they should have.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how much head football coach Buddy Stephens knew about the videos or their content. He refused multiple requests for comment. Alsobrooks said he doesn\u2019t believe the hype video issue has strained relations between him and Stephens.\n\nAlsobrooks said he first learned about the videos when a Lowndes County supervisor Leroy Brooks confronted him about it in August. Brooks said a college trustee had shown him clips and he found the material inappropriate.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Commercial Dispatch, http://www.cdispatch.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Mississippi community college says football team videos that cost thousands of dollars violated copyright law and college policy, but the process has been reformed to make the videos legal and filter out profanity.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
