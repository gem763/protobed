Instead, her aides explained, the vote was designed simply to lay out the \u201cnext steps\u201d of the inquiry, including the process for holding hearings in public rather than behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cThe resolution,\u201d the speaker wrote, \u201cestablishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the President and his counsel.\u201d\n\nIn essence, then, Pelosi is giving Republicans and the White House what they claim to have wanted\u2014clarity on the process moving forward and an assurance that the House would not try to impeach Trump without a full public airing of its charges and an opportunity for him to respond.\n\nAnother reason for her decision has to do with the courts. Despite the willingness of some Trump administrations to testify, Democrats have struggled to compel White House officials to turn over documents and appear before their committees. On Monday, a former interim national security adviser, Charles Kupperman, declined to appear for a deposition after filing a lawsuit in which he asked judges to decide whether he needed to testify. Although a federal judge ruled in the Democrats\u2019 favor in a separate case last week, Pelosi acknowledged that passing the resolution would strengthen the party\u2019s legal case.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this step to eliminate any doubt,\u201d she wrote, \u201cas to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nRead: The closed-door impeachment\n\nThe House will be on recess next week, and Democratic members will have to address the impeachment inquiry when they meet with their constituents. For lawmakers in swing districts, the fear of having to take a vote on impeachment\u2014which drove Pelosi\u2019s initial decision not to have one\u2014may have given way to anxiety that the GOP\u2019s accusation of railroading has been resonating with the public. And for most of the party, a vote shouldn\u2019t be difficult: All but a handful of House Democrats have already come out in favor of an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s attempt to get Ukraine\u2019s president to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nPolls have shown a significant bump in support for impeachment since Pelosi announced the start of the inquiry, and it\u2019s less of a vulnerability for Democrats. The pressure will now be on Republicans: Will those like Representatives Francis Rooney of Florida, Will Hurd of Texas, and Mark Amodei of Nevada, who have voiced concerns about Trump\u2019s actions, back the formal opening of an inquiry?", "description": "The speaker long opposed a formal vote on the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.
