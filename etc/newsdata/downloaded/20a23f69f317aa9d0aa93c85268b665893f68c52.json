Jonathan Petramala was in Rockaway Beach, New York, with more details. Accuweather\n\nStory Highlights The storm will most likely make landfall somewhere along the Florida Panhandle.\n\nThis system has the potential to bring heavy rainfall, damaging winds and a coastal storm surge.\n\nIf its winds reach 39 mph, it would become the hurricane season's 14th named storm, Nestor.\n\nTropical storm warnings have been issued for the Gulf Coast as a system gathers strength in the western Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says the disturbance that could become Tropical Storm Nestor is likely to develop into a tropical or subtropical system in the next day or two.\n\n\"Tropical development can occur at any time into Saturday as the system travels northeastward over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico,\" said Dan Kottlowski, an AccuWeather hurricane expert.\n\nForecasters issued a tropical storm warning for southeastern Louisiana and the northern Gulf Coast from the Alabama-Mississippi line to the Big Bend area of Florida.

Urban flooding can occur even though much of the Southeast states could stand more rain because of ongoing drought conditions.\n\nThe system could still be a tropical storm on Sunday morning over eastern North Carolina before moving back over water, forecasters said.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the disturbance, now known as Potential Tropical Cyclone 16, had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and was located about 570 miles southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River. It was moving to the north-northeast at 9 mph.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\n10 AM CDT: NHC has initiated advisories on Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen.
