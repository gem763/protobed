If I were a betting man, I\u2019d say Biden gets third in the first three states. I think Biden\u2019s people are punting at this point. And in Iowa here, it seems like they\u2019re just going through the motions and playing for second place.\u201d\n\nSince Warren\u2019s rise in the polls, the Biden campaign has been tempering expectations in multiple donor meetings and in interviews with journalists. \u201cDo we think we have to win Iowa? No. Do we want to win Iowa? Yes, we do,\u201d a Biden aide said in a September phone call with reporters. \u201cWe think we\u2019re going to win; we know it\u2019s going to be a dogfight.
