Against this backdrop, stocks like Y-mAbs Therapeutics, which have advanced assets as well as upside potential, should be \u201cparticularly attractive for investors,\u201d Nierengarten said in the initiation note.\n\nTwo of the company\u2019s lead candidates, naxitamab and radiolabeled 131I-omburtamab, have exhibited positive results in patients with neuroblastoma.\n\nThe analyst expects the Biologics License Application (BLA) filings, both of which are scheduled for the fourth quarter, to be successful and for both candidates to be approved in 2020.\n\nY-mAbs has label expansion opportunities in the near term, into front-line high risk and retreating neuroblastoma for both the candidates and additionally osteosarcoma for naxitamab, Nierengarten mentioned.\n\nThe company\u2019s pipeline includes a therapeutic cancer vaccine, bispecific antibody programs and Lu177-omburtamab. Y-mAbs earlier stage efforts, particularly radiolabeled Lu177-omburtamab, \u201ccould provide significant upside as it progresses through the clinic to treat B7-H3 positive CNS/LM (central nervous system / leptomeningeal metastasis) tumors in adults,\u201d Nierengarten wrote.\n\nPrice Action\n\nShares of Y-mAbs Therapeutics were up 168% to $25.91 Wednesday.\n\nRelated Links\n\nThe Daily Biotech Pulse: Regeneron's Bad Cholesterol Drug Aces Late-Stage Trial, Oncolytics Offering\n\nThe Week Ahead In Biotech: Vanda Awaits FDA Decision, BioVie Plans IPO\n\nLatest Ratings for YMAB\n\nDate Firm Action From To Sep 2019 Initiates Coverage On Outperform Apr 2019 Initiates Coverage On Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for YMAB\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
