See you guys in Crawley next week!\u2019\n\nNice to bounce back after the silliness earlier in the week and win group 1 of the championship league today!

If I\u2019d lost to Mark Selby yesterday I\u2019d probably have been out but that gave me a chance and I played much better today.\n\n\u2018I am really pleased to get through. Ryan was looking good at 2-0 up and cruising but he missed a tough black and I was able to capitalise.\u2019\n\nHopefully now the 37-year-old can put the embarrassment of missing the Yushan qualifier behind him, which even led to World Snooker writing to him, reminding Robertson of the venue of the English Open in Crawley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGroup Two of the Championship League is played over 9 and 10 October, with the Winners\u2019 Group being played in March next year.\n\nMORE: World Snooker group four events into new \u2018European Series\u2019 with \u00a3150k bonus on offer\n\nMORE: Judd Trump aiming to emulate Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s longevity at the top of snooker", "description": "Neil Robertson has put the 'silliness' of missing out on the World Open behind him by winning Championship League Group One and booking his spot in next year's Winners' Group....", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174590798_1570618166.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
