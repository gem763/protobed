To get this discount, enter SAVE15 at checkout.\n\nAs is usually the case with Rakuten\u2019s site-wide sales, you can save money on almost anything it offers with the same offer code. So, if you have your eye on something else, like Sony\u2019s WH1000XM3 wireless headphones, it should work fine. Also, keep in mind that while Rakuten\u2019s site-wide sale is set to last until tomorrow night, inventory of Switch Lite consoles may sell out before then.", "description": "You can save $30 on Nintendo\u2019s new Switch Lite handheld console.
