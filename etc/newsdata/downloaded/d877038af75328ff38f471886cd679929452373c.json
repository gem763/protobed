The dispute has cost the council up to \u00a34 million despite 746 council workers losing their jobs due to lack of funding\n\nHe added: 'There are two sides to every story - I have had no opportunity to present mine.'\n\nThe row was sparked over claims Mr O'Sullivan, deputy Nigel Barnett and head of legal services Daniel Perkins authorised a 20 per cent pay rise for senior officers in 2012.\n\nCriminal charges were dropped in 2015 and the two other men agreed payouts worth \u00a3300,000 between them.\n\nBut no agreement was made with Mr O'Sullivan and he was put on special leave, continuing to receive his salary.\n\nCouncil interim leader Barbara Jones said: 'We regret the amount of time and money that has been spent on this matter, but we had no choice other than to follow the agreed statutory process.\n\n'It should also be noted that during this time we had to allow criminal investigations to proceed, which added almost two-and-a-half years to the overall time frame.'\n\nJess Turner, of the union Unison Cymru, said the issue should have been sorted 'years ago'.\n\nShe said: 'Staff are absolutely sick of it and the council needs to move on.\n\n'Since 2010, severe spending cuts driven from Westminster have cost the jobs of 746 Caerphilly council workers, yet as much as \u00a36 million has been ploughed into a single issue.'\n\nCaerphilly AM Hefin David said he was 'relieved that the saga is over' but it had taken 'too long to get to this point'.\n\nAfter his sacking Mr O'Sullivan said: 'What I would say to the people of Caerphilly now is wait until the employment tribunal takes place in public, wait until the full facts emerge in the public domain. Then make a reasoned decision.'\n\nHe added the decision was made 'clearly on political ground' and the matter 'is far from concluded.'\n\nMr O'Sullivan said he would be appealing the decision to sack him at an employment tribunal.", "description": "Anthony O'Sullivan, 60, was suspended from his job as Labour council's chief executive in Caerphilly, South Wales.
