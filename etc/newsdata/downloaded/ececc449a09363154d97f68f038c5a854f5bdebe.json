It had come down to $585 billion by the time Obama left office in January, 2017.", "description": "The US federal deficit has soared to $984 billion, marking a $205 billion - or 26 per cent - increase within the last year and demonstrating a failure of conservative leadership to balance a climbing deficit.Now inheriting the highest deficit in seven years, Donald Trump has committed billions of dollars", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N8LSvaUpYDahO241eexrGA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/b432ccbe2facc9f2156f70f129eb4602", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
