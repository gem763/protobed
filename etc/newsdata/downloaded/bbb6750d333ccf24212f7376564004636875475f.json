(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nColumnist\n\nIvanka Trump descended upon Bogota, Colombia, this week to talk about women\u2019s empowerment and left us talking about her sleeves. They were voluminous, bell-shaped swaths of green fabric. As the first daughter stood in solemn formation with the Colombian vice president, the sleeves caught a draft and attempted to launch themselves away from her body. Midair, they formed into perfect circles, and this became the hallmark photograph of the trip. Ivanka Trump from the neck up was on a mission of benign diplomacy. From the neck down, flying saucers.\n\nIt\u2019s shallow to call attention to a minor clothing malfunction, but this viral sleeve image is what alerted many people to the fact that Ivanka Trump \u2014 who, after all, is not an elected official with a dedicated press corps \u2014 was in Latin America at all.\n\nTo understand exactly what she was doing there, your best hope was to follow the itinerary she unspooled on Instagram: She launched the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs, which, she said, was \u201cdesigned to equip women with the practical skills they need to create sustainable businesses and to participate more fully in the global economy.\u201d She participated in a wreath-laying ceremony. She met with Colombia\u2019s president and vice president, and then she prepared to head to Argentina and Paraguay for more of the same.\n\nIvanka abroad seems to be Ivanka\u2019s platonic ideal of herself: doing things that are considered patriotic but not overly political, important but not controversial, and personally on-brand. If you believe the rumors that Ivanka will run for office one day, you see her social media presence as fodder for a future campaign ad.\n\nFour of her recent Instagram stories have been devoted to her encounters abroad with heads of state. On a trip to Africa earlier this year, she documented herself sitting with Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde. At the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, she name-checked a whirlwind of prime ministers. She went to South Korea and met the president; another photo in that series saw her slipping off to meet North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s deepest desires are primal and obvious: to be loved and worshiped. What his daughter wants has always been a little harder to pin down, but when she\u2019s traveling abroad you see it plain: to be legitimate. To earn respect in a cohort composed not of the sycophants her father favors but of intellectual leaders. To fit in well enough that foreign dignitaries begin to think she really is one of the foremost experts the United States has to offer.\n\nTo be Ivanka abroad is to escape from the utter weirdness of this White House, with its rally chants and doctored weather charts, and instead give speeches to erudite diplomatic allies who are protocol-bound to nod and smile. Back home, her father is starting an online feud with an actress from \u201cWill and Grace,\u201d but Ivanka is in Colombia, praising the economic empowerment of female business owners, visiting a strawberry farm.\n\nOccasionally, there are cracks in the facade.\n\nIn June, a deeply cringeworthy video was released by the French government. In it, French President Emmanuel Macron chatted with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau; Theresa May, then British prime minister; and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde. And Ivanka \u2014 Ivanka was there, too, horning in on the conversation. She could be heard, in the 20-second clip, clumsily interjecting something about \u201cmale-dominated\u201d industries.\n\nIn response, Macron looked away. May ignored the comment. Lagarde pursed her lips, and delivered what could only be described as baffled side-eye.\n\nWhat had prompted her to think she needed to speak in that moment? What was she doing there at all?\n\nMoments like this are useful, because they bring us back to reality. The reality of Ivanka is that she goes on these trips, and she meets these leaders, and she is smart and gracious, but she is not Theresa May. She is not Angela Merkel or Christine Lagarde; she is Ivanka Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s always hard for me to figure out how, or whether, to criticize Ivanka Trump. She prompts withering hatred from her detractors, but focusing the hatred on specific charges is harder than one might think. At a surface level, she says the right things, she tweets the right things. Her causes are backed by good impulses \u2014 who doesn\u2019t want economic opportunities for women in developing countries?\n\nThey are also, of course, backed by rampant nepotism: last month, the White House looked at canceling billions of dollars in foreign aid, but officials said Ivanka\u2019s initiatives would not be affected.\n\nStill, it\u2019s easy to see how in normal times, the public might let that slide. In normal times, under a normal president, we might let his daughter have her projects and initiatives.\n\nThat, I\u2019d argue, is everyone\u2019s essential problem with Ivanka, even if they haven\u2019t quite put their finger on it: She behaves as if we are in normal times. She behaves as if she is working in a normal administration. And she behaves as if her role is benign diplomacy, rather than what her role should be \u2014 acknowledging and fighting against the madness.\n\nThe work she wants to do internationally on behalf of women is laudable, but there are dozens of scholars and economists who could do it as well or better; nobody needs Ivanka\u2019s specific brain on these matters.\n\nWhat she could do \u2014 what only she could do \u2014 is act as a public check on the president of the United States. She could offer an informed, clear-eyed perspective on her father\u2019s behaviors and fitness for office. She could publicly express with a daughter\u2019s love and concern that, yes, it is really worrisome that the president keeps falsely insisting that Alabama is going to be hit by Hurricane Dorian. She could say, \u201cHere\u2019s what he\u2019s doing that scares me.\u201d She could say, \u201cLook, here\u2019s everything I know. I love my dad, but here\u2019s everything I know.\u201d\n\nWould she be fired? Probably. Disinherited? Maybe.\n\nBut that\u2019s where her value is. That\u2019s her diplomatic mission. The one thing she could be doing to be taken seriously is the one thing she\u2019s not doing.\n\nInstead, while the president unleashes strange rants about \u201cAmerica\u2019s Spying Apparatus,\u201d and how Hurricane Dorian really was going to hit Alabama, Ivanka posts photos of herself hugging women in the strawberry field.\n\nInstead, while migrant children are being traumatized at the U.S. border, the first daughter visited a camp for migrants on the border . . . of Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nShe is the single person on the planet whose public approval or disapproval of her father could possibly matter \u2014 to him or to his supporters.\n\nIf she wanted to be thought of as a serious person, as a hero rather than a passive villain or cipher, she could have impact where she actually could have unique, meaningful impact.\n\nInstead, we\u2019re left scrolling through pictures on her Instagram feed. And analyzing her flying dress sleeves. Which is the only visual preposterous enough to evoke the absurdity of it all.\n\nMonica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.
