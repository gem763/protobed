Col. Alexander Vindman against vicious attacks from President Donald Trump's allies.\n\nRepublicans may quibble with the substance of Vindman\u2019s testimony as they try to protect Trump from the fast-moving impeachment inquiry. But congressional GOP leaders say it\u2019s out of bounds to question Vindman\u2019s patriotism and allegiance to the United States, as some conservative pundits did on Monday night.\n\nSeveral top Republicans on Tuesday made emphatic statements in support of Vindman, a National Security Council official who heard Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president and testified that it was improper for Trump to demand an investigation into Joe Biden and represented a threat to U.S. national security.\n\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s a Purple Heart. I think it would be a mistake to attack his credibility,\u201d South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said in an interview. \u201cYou can obviously take issue with the substance and there are different interpretations about all that stuff. But I wouldn\u2019t go after him personally. He\u2019s a patriot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to question the patriotism of any of the people who come forward,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), though he declined to comment \"on the merit of what\u2019s going forward\" or Vindman's suggestion that he was concerned Trump's actions had undermined national security.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of the most hawkish Republicans in the House and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said it would be \u201cshameful\u201d to question Vindman\u2019s loyalty or patriotism to the country.\n\nCheney wasn\u2019t even pressed by reporters on the topic; in her opening remarks during a weekly leadership news conference in the Capitol, she went out of her way to decry the attacks on Vindman, including the outlandish theory that he was a potential spy working against the United States.\n\n\u201cWe need to show that we are better than that as a nation,\u201d said Cheney, the third-ranking House Republican. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who put their lives on the line. And it is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in this process.\u201d\n\n\"This is the career military officer with a Purple Heart? I'm sure he's doing his best to serve his country,\" said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 4 GOP leader. \"Somebody can have a wrong sense of where they think the path goes but that doesn't mean that they're wrongly motivated. ... Criticizing this guy? No. I wouldn't be on board.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) said on CNN that Vindman seems \u201cincredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy,\u201d adding that Vindman\u2019s \u201caffinity\u201d may be for Ukraine not the United States.\n\nTrump also attacked Vindman as a \"Never Trumper witness\" on Tuesday.\n\nBut it appeared the criticism from Duffy's former colleagues was having an effect. Duffy tweeted later Tuesday that Vindman is an \"American war hero,\" and that the point he was trying to make is that \"Mr. Vindman is an unelected advisor, he gives ADVICE. President Trump sets the policy.\"\n\nOn Monday night, former George W. Bush administration official John Yoo said Vindman may have participated in \u201cespionage\u201d after Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham suggested that Vindman was \u201cadvising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the president\u2019s interest.\u201d Yoo later released a statement saying his critics were \"deliberately\" twisting his words and that he wasn't accusing Vindman of being \"some kind of double agent.\"\n\nAsked about joining the attacks, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said \"I'm not going to do it and I would encourage others not to.\"\n\nSens. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) also said they had no reason to question the character of Vindman, while Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), one of the president's closest allies, said he would not comment on the matter.\n\nBut even as GOP lawmakers dismiss or sidestep such rhetoric, Republicans are not ready to endorse Vindman\u2019s testimony, which Democrats say is explosive.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he is grateful for Vindman\u2019s service to the country, but argued that the White House official's version of events is \u201cwrong.\u201d And Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Vindman is \u201ctalking about the call we already know about. So we can make our own judgment.\u201d", "description": "Republican leaders are stepping up to defend Lt. Col.
