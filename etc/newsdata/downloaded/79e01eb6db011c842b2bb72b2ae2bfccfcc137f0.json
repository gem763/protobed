The California senator argues that such a level of spending could effectively end chronic homelessness in America.\n\nThe proposal has almost no chance in the GOP-held Senate. But it\u2019s a sign of how seriously the presidential candidates are taking the homeless crisis as they compete for votes in California and other states with intractable homelessness problems.\n\nIn fact, the price tag is on the lower end of other proposals released by Harris and her 2020 rivals to build more housing and get people shelter.\n\n\u201cWe must act quickly to tackle our country\u2019s homelessness crisis head on with serious investments in programs that get at the root causes of this issue,\u201d Harris said in a statement. \u201cThis is our best chance to make a difference and put roofs over people\u2019s heads\u2026 The women and men who woke up this morning on a bench or under an overpass cannot afford to wait.\u201d\n\nMuch of the new funding \u2014 $5 billion over the next five years \u2014 would go to state grants to build 85,000 new permanent supportive housing units. The funds could also be used for transitional housing programs, rapid rehousing efforts, and emergency shelters.\n\nIn addition, it would allocate $2.5 billion for 300,000 additional housing vouchers prioritized for people who are or could become homeless; more than $5 billion to build new affordable housing; and $500 million for case management and social work outreach for homeless or formerly homeless people.\n\nThe bill \u2014 which was introduced in the House by Southern California Rep. Maxine Waters \u2014 takes a page from past federal programs that have made gains in reducing veteran homelessness, and attempts to expand that approach to the general population.\n\nAdvocates say that it\u2019s the kind of funding needed to resolve a crisis that has more than 550,000 people around the country living outside on any given night, including nearly 130,000 in California, according to official estimates.\n\n\u201cThere is a fundamental mismatch between what housing costs and how much money people have (in their budget) to spend on housing,\u201d said Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. \u201cIn worst cases, this leads to evictions and homelessness. This is a national crisis, that demands urgent action from policy makers at all levels.\u201d\n\nThe bill doesn\u2019t specify how it would be paid for, designating the spending as an emergency requirement in order to get around congressional rules requiring most legislation to be budget neutral. Harris\u2019 staff said they plan to work with the Senate banking and housing committee to figure out the best way to pay for it.\n\nWaters introduced a version of the bill in 2017 that went nowhere. But now the legislation is getting more consideration after Democrats took control of the House in last year\u2019s midterms: It passed the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year and is expected to get a full floor vote soon, Harris said.\n\n\u201cIn the richest country in the world, it is simply unacceptable that we have people living in the streets,\u201d Waters said in a statement. \u201cIt is time for Congress to step up and provide the resources and funding necessary to address this important issue.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York \u2014 one of Harris\u2019 former presidential rivals \u2014 are also co-sponsoring the bill.\n\nWhile housing policy has long been an afterthought in presidential campaigns, that seems to be changing this year. Candidates like Harris, senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, have all released sweeping plans to spur housing construction and reduce homelessness. Their proposals include tax credits for renters, increasing homebuyer assistance and even larger investments in housing construction. Many of those plans would cost more than Harris\u2019 latest bill.\n\nAll of the candidates are likely to be pressed on the issue when they campaign in California, which has some of the steepest housing costs in the country and has taken on increasing importance thanks to its relatively early position on the primary calendar.\n\nRelated Articles Skelton: Harris isn\u2019t a shoo-in to win California\u2019s primary after all\n\nHarris calls for details on Trump call with Chinese leader\n\nPitts: Democrats arguments over electability are annoying\n\nKamala Harris, other Democratic presidential candidates call for Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment\n\nKamala Harris prosecuted a mentally ill woman shot by SF police. The jury didn\u2019t buy it. President Trump has also showed an interest in having the federal government more actively fight homelessness in California, although he\u2019s been vague on what that would entail. Some local leaders see his comments about the issue as a political stunt to make the deeply blue state look bad.\n\nSpeaking with reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday, Trump said in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, \u201cthere\u2019s needles and drugs all over the street, there\u2019s tents, there\u2019s people who are dying of squalor\u2026 see what the Democrats have allowed to happen.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Casey Tolan", "Casey Tolan Covers Politics For The Bay Area News Group."], "top_image": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1161345609-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
