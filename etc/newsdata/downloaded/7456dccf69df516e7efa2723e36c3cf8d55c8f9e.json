But that\u2019s not very compelling.\n\nSo I asked veteran outfielder Adam Eaton about the moment where it all changed for them.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t one particular moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many games.\u201d\n\nThen he dropped what may be the theme of the 2019 Nationals \u2014 a T-shirt in the making, perhaps.\n\n\u201cLike Paul Konerko once told me, you can only suck for so long,\u201d Eaton said.\n\nYou can only suck for so long.\n\nThe 2008 and 2009 Nationals squads may argue with that philosophy. But essentially, those are the words the Nationals clung to during their dismal start in April and May.\n\nFollowing one after another soul-crushing loss in the first two months of the season, the Nationals would file into their quiet clubhouse, and one veteran \u2014 sometimes Max Scherzer, sometimes Ryan Zimmerman or Kurt Suzuki \u2014 would stand up and say, perhaps not in these words, \u201cYou can only suck for so long.\u201d\n\nThey looked around the room and saw the talent around them and believed it \u2013 believed that they were not this bad.\n\nThey didn\u2019t blame manager Davey Martinez. In fact, they took their cue from the manager, who never changed in his public support of his players.\n\n\u201cWe have such a good veteran group in the clubhouse,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cWe just put our heads down, played baseball, tried to figure things out and keep working through things. There was never a moment where suddenly we said, \u2018OK, that was it, now we are ready to go.\u2019 It was just keep playing good baseball, try not to pay too much attention to it and good things happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we weren\u2019t playing hard when we were losing,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody saw we were playing with good effort, good intensity.\u201d\n\nThen he offered this, a dose of reality for those who dismiss clubhouse chemistry.\n\n\u201cIt might have went in the other direction,\u201d Eaton said.\n\n\u201cI credit a lot of our veterans, Max and Zim and a lot of the older guys who continued to make sure we weren\u2019t paying attention to anything other than ourselves and keep playing,\u201d he said. \u201cGood things will happen \u2026 we would come in after a tough loss and having not played well for a long time, and Max or Zim or Suz would say, \u2018Hey boys, it\u2019s going to turn. Don\u2019t worry about it. Just keep it at. Things will change in our favor.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd they did.\n\nI felt there was a different vibe to this team from spring training, in large part because of the presence of young studs like Juan Soto and Victor Robles, who are two of the cornerstones of this powerful Nationals offense. They brought a spirit to what had been for years, for the most part, a laid-back group. More importantly, they didn\u2019t fold during the bad times and never shrunk from the moment.\n\n\u201cRobles and Soto are very receptive,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cThey won\u2019t get crushed by the wave.\u201d\n\nEaton, of course, qualified all of this with the reality that it\u2019s the end of August and there is a lot of baseball left to play. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d he said. \u201cJust keep playing baseball.\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget \u2013 you can only suck for so long.\n\n\u2022 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
