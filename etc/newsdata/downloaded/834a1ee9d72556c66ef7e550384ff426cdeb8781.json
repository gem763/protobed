And when they came to get me as a suspect, they asked him if he would go with me. This is the ultimate 'take a bullet for your homie' kind of thing,\" Salaam said. \"And I was just so grateful to see that because, I didn't know, we never spoke about what our experiences were like. This was really the first time ... for us to have seen each other's stories ... and now the whole world got an opportunity to see it.\"\n\nMilo Ventimiglia\n\nThe patriarch of the \"This Is Us\" cast brought his parents to the Emmys.\n\nSteve Granitz/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nMilo Ventimiglia, nominated for lead actor in a drama series, said it was his parents' first time at the award show because they turned down his invitation the last two years.\n\n\"They've been excited and they've always been supportive of me. To show them what this show is, I think it's an experience,\" the actor told E!.\n\n\"I can\u2019t look at them too much or I'll start crying,\" Ventimiglia said. \"We need to give examples of coming together and showing love, and it's such a strength to be able to show love -- and in many different ways.\"\n\n\"Very proud,\" his dad added.\n\nMilo Ventimiglia is always making us cry.
