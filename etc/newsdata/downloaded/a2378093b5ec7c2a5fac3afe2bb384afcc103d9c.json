And now it is about to come with in an even more exotic and \u2013 according to our tasters, delicious \u2013 version.\n\nIn mid October, Nestl\u00e9 is due to release a limited edition Milkybar with 7% of dried grated coconut.\n\nIt not only drew general approval, but one of our tasters even described it as bordering on heavenly.\n\nMilkybar holds a 47% market share among white chocolate, according to Alex Villela, confectionery business executive efficer at Nestl\u00e9 Eastern and Southern African Region.\n\n\u201cWe aim to deliver a great taste with a nice contrasting texture of smooth and creamy white chocolate and crispy coconut,\u201d said Villela.\n\nA serving size portion, which ends up being about four blocks, is packed with 535 kilojoules of energy.\n\nIf you can\u2019t stop at just four pieces, an 80g bar comes in at around 1,872kj - a quarter of your recommended daily kilojoule intake.\n\nTasters said polishing off a bar wouldn\u2019t be too difficult.\n\n\"It\u2019s one of the best chocolate combinations I\u2019ve tried, and I think I might prefer it over the original. I\u2019ll definitely be buying it when the white chocolate cravings set in,\u201d said one taster.\n\nAnother described it as a new favourite: \"So creamy and smooth, and I love the coconut in there \u2013 not overwhelming at all.\".\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clever that they have used the coconut to slow down the speed at which the chocolate dissolves away over the taste buds. There\u2019s also a lovely coconut flavour that comes through after the white chocolate which increases the pleasure of the experience,\u201d said another taste.\n\nBut the new flavour wasn\u2019t a universal winner.\n\n\u201cI enjoy the subtly of the coconut flavour. It doesn't overpower the Milkybar taste that I know and love. However, I don't enjoy the little pieces of coconut that linger after a bite,\u201d said one taster.\n\n\u201cIt was not bad, but I will not buy it \u2013 the Cadbury one where they use coconut and cashews is much more tasty\u2026also did not like the coconut in the milk chocolate combination \u2013 maybe I would have liked it more when combined with a darker chocolate,\u201d said another.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The limited-edition version contains crispy grated coconut, and it works.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9279/eafe9841e8884bd687fab947654d04b4.jpg"}
