The source declined to comment on the terms of any potential deal.\n\nAn agreement would likely boost Banco Inter's business, as Brazil is Uber's largest market outside the United States. S\u00e3o Paulo has more Uber rides than any other city in the world.\n\nIn Mexico, Uber struck a partnership with bank BBVA (MC: ) and payments processor Mastercard (NYSE: ) to launch a commission-free debit card for drivers in July.\n\nSoftBank, which in March launched a $5 billion Latin America fund, declined to comment. Banco Inter and Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe talks were first reported earlier on Sunday by Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo.", "description": "Uber and Banco Inter in talks to forge partnership in Brazil: source", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9C0K1_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
