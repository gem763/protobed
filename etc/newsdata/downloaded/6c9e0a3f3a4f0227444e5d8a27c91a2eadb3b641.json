REUTERS/Thaier al-Sudani\n\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi called on lawmakers on Thursday to support him to reshuffle cabinet posts and urged calm after three days of deadly civil unrest rocked the country.\n\nAbdul Mahdi said there was no \u2018magic solution\u2019 to Iraq\u2019s chronic governance problems and graft but pledged to try to pass a law granting poor families a basic income.\n\nHe gave his remarks in a televised speech as protesters demanded the fall of the government.\n\nThe prime minister said protesters\u2019 calls to end corruption were \u201ccorrect\u201d but said the government must be helped to carry out its duties. Ministerial amendments must be approved by parliament.\n\nAbdul Mahdi on Wednesday declared a curfew in Baghdad until further notice after at least seven people were killed and more than 400 were injured during two days of nationwide anti-government demonstrations.\n\nCurfews were imposed earlier in three southern cities while elite counter-terrorism troops opened fire on protesters trying to storm Baghdad airport and deployed to the southern city of Nassiriya after gunfights broke out between protesters and security forces, police sources said.\n\nInternet outages were reported across the country.\n\nAny power vacuum in Iraq, should the government be toppled, could prove challenging for the region, given Baghdad\u2019s status as an ally of both the United States and Iran, who are locked in a political standoff.", "description": "Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi called on lawmakers on Thursday to support him to reshuffle cabinet posts and urged calm after three days of deadly civil unrest rocked the country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436837628&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921XZ"}
