We have to be much more serious about this.\u201d\n\nMs Greer added: \u201cThe United States is Irish. If anyone thinks that they\u2019re going to get a deal through and have a trade relationship with the United States that shafts Ireland, you\u2019ve got another thing coming.\u201d\n\nHer defence of Ireland\u2019s interests received enthusiastic support on social media.\n\nDeclan Lawn, a writer and filmmaker, wrote: \u201cCan we get Bonnie Greer an Irish passport so she can be president after Michael D [Higgins]?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my god Bonnie Greer, if Ireland ever has a Queen, [I] nominate you,\u201d Nicola Coughlan, an actor known for her role in Derry Girls, added.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s proposal would create two new borders for Northern Ireland, with custom checks on trade with the Republic and a regulatory control border down the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nHowever, that proposal has been rejected by the European parliament, which said it was not \u201ceven remotely\u201d acceptable.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
