His spokespeople later released a joint agreement signed by key Israeli Right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties saying \"they will not enter a coalition without each other\".\n\nMr Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving premier, had been vowing to form a right-wing \u201cZionist government\u201d led by his Likud party. But partial results and exit polls showed that Blue and White will sweep more of the 120 Knesset seats than Mr Netnayahu\u2019s party.\n\n\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the partial results were showing that Mr Gantz\u2019s bloc may in fact be larger than Mr Netanyahu\u2019s but neither bloc is large enough to secure the 61-seat majority needed to form a government.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The nation expects us, both of us, to demonstrate responsibility and that we pursue cooperation,\" He added.\n\nHe then urged his chief rival to meet him \u201c today, at any hour\u201d.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Blue and White spokespeople when contacted by The Independent. They later said that said Mr Gantz would release a statement at 1pm local time.\n\n\n\nHowever the day before Mr Gantz said he hoped for a \"good, desirable unity government\" but also ruled out forming one with Likud that is led by Netanyahu, citing looming corruption charges against the prime minister. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.\n\nIsraelis went to an unprecedented second election on Tuesday, after Mr Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud party failed to form a coalition government following a previous vote in April.\n\nMr Netanyahu\u2019s former ally and ex-defence minister Avigdor Lieberman pulled his right wing Yisrael Beiteinu party out of the coalition-building process at the last minute.\n\nIn this round Israeli media reported that with 97 per cent of the votes counted, Blue and White were in the lead with 33 seats while Likud secured 31.\n\nMore devastating for Mr Netanyahu is that his bloc of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties currently stands at 55 seats. While Mr Gantz\u2019s centre-left bloc has 57 seats.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

During fraught negotiations on Wednesday he promised his staunchest allies, the ultra-Orthodox parties, he would stick by them.\n\nBlue and White called for a secular unity coalition in the later stages of their campaign. Mr Lieberman, meanwhile, has also called for a secular parliamentary alliance.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister and the Likud shared a statement on Thursday, in which the country's main Right-wing parties, together with the two ultra-Orthodox parties, signed a statement saying they \"will not enter any coalition without each other\".\n\n", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted here is no chance he can form a right-wing government after\u00a0Israel\u2018s fraught election and called on his main rival, centrist Benny Gantz, to join him in a \u201cbroad, unity government\u201d to break the deadlock.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/09/Netanyahu-Israel-Gantz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
