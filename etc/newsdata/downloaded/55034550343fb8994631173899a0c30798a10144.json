(But) in the end, it abandoned the Kurds and, in essence, betrayed them,\" Peskov was cited as saying.\n\n\"Now they (the Americans) prefer to leave the Kurds at the border (with Turkey) and almost force them to fight the Turks.\"\n\nIf the Kurds did not withdraw as per the deal between Moscow and Ankara, Peskov said that Syrian borders guards and Russian military police would have to withdraw, leaving the Kurds to be dealt with by the Turkish army.
