This plan will give her $157,000 a year", "language": "en", "text": "Situation: Unpredictable illness complicates woman\u2019s retirement planning\n\nSolution: Plan for long life with the idea that money not dispensed can be left as a legacy\n\nA woman we\u2019ll call Nancy, 65, lives in Ontario. An officer of a financial institution, she has recently been generating after-tax income of $15,700 per month. Unfortunately, her future is clouded by the chance that a serious heart condition could worsen. Investment returns are less important than life expectancy, so it is imperative that she cut costs and live with less stress. With that in mind, we have designed a financial plan that generates ample cash. It diversifies her assets, reduces investment risk, allows Nancy to enjoy what she has earned and is structured to leave assets to beneficiaries such as her three grown children or charities.\n\nNancy\u2019s real estate holdings, which consist of her $2,575,000 home, a $1,200,000 investment property and a $675,000 cottage, make up 85 per cent of her assets. She also has $698,000 in financial assets and $90,000 worth of personal property. The investment property and financial assets both produce income that adds substantially to her employment income.\n\nemail andrew.allentuck@gmail.com for a free Family Finance analysis\n\nNancy has $590,000 of mortgages, $365,000 of which is on her investment property. The balance, $225,000, is on her own home. Interest on the investment property mortgage is tax-deductible; interest on the home mortgage is not deductible. She needs a plan to simplify her life, for financial assets are easier to manage than buildings that need maintenance.\n\nFamily Finance asked Graeme Egan, a financial planner and portfolio manager who heads CastleBay Wealth Management Inc. in Vancouver, to work with Nancy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wanted here is advice on her plan to sell her present house in order to free up capital to generate income. It would trigger no capital gains tax. She could move into her investment property, though it would require $350,000 of renovations. Nancy also has a lake cottage worth $675,000. She\u2019d like it to keep for her children.\u201d\n\nValuing property\n\nDividing assets after she passes away would be easier with less real estate to distribute among heirs. If she did sell her house, she could net $2,446,250 after five per cent selling costs. Take off two mortgages, a total of $590,000, and deduct $350,000 needed to spruce up the rental for her own use and she would be left with about $1.5 million.\n\nThe rental property has two units. She could live in one and rent one to a son, Egan notes. By moving into one of the two units, Nancy would trigger the Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s Change of Use Rule. The property would be deemed to have changed its character and there would be capital gains tax to be paid on its appreciation. However, Nancy could file an election to defer the tax until the property is sold. The election has to be filed in the year the change of use is made. She would have to pay capital gains tax on the investment property\u2019s change in value from the time she purchased it to the time it became her principal residence. The election could be filed on just the one unit given that the other unit would continue to be a revenue-producing rental.\n\nThe monthly budget\n\nNancy has focused on real estate investment and has no Tax-Free Savings Account. Although $7,954 of her $15,700 monthly take home income goes to mortgages, tax and property maintenance, she has $7,746 of income for other things. She has an expensive car lease, $868 per month, that will end in about a year. She contributes $2,125 to her RRSP each month. That will eventually end. With available cash or proceeds of sale of her house, she should open a TFSA and fill her $63,500 space.\n\nIf she reduces her hefty property allocation and raises her allocation to financial assets, she could settle on a portfolio half property and half financial assets. Those financial assets could be half bonds, half stocks, Egan suggests. She has $50,000 cash that we\u2019ll leave for care should she need it.\n\nRetirement plans\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we assume that Nancy retires this year. If she sells her home, applies $350,000 to renovating the rental where she could live, pays the mortgage off, then she will have $1.87 million with no tax on the capital gain of her principal residence. If she elects to structure annual payments of this money, growing at three per cent per year after inflation for 25 years, she could have $8,690 per month or $104,300 per year.\n\nShe will have $63,500 in her TFSA. With the three per cent assumption for returns after inflation, it will produce $3,650 per year or $305 monthly in 2019 dollars per year for 25 years to her age 90.\n\nThere is $648,000 in her RRSP. That sum, still growing at three per cent per year after inflation, will yield $36,130 per year or $3,010 monthly for 25 years to her age 90.\n\nHer monthly pre-tax cash flow at age 65 with these assumptions will total about $12,000. Add her expected Canada Pension Plan benefits, $1,133 per month, exclude TFSA payouts, and she will have $157,600 annual taxable income. She will lose all of her annual $7,289 Old Age Security to the clawback which, at time of writing, starts when taxable income exceeds $75,910 and ends when income hits $123,386. Her average tax rate will be about 30 per cent and with TFSA income added back, she will have about $9,500 per month to spend, Egan estimates.\n\nHer present allocations of $15,700 per month, which cover her home and two rental units, would plummet with sale of her house. Her costs would drop by $1,840 for her home mortgage and perhaps $2,000 per month for taxes and maintenance. If she retires, she would end her $2,125 monthly RRSP contribution, cutting costs to $9,735. When her car lease, $868 per month, ends, she could choose a simpler car and save $500 per month. Her after-tax income would exceed spending.\n\nThis financial projection is for 25 years. \u201cWe hope that Nancy will have all that time to enjoy what she has earned, but given her serious condition, she may wish to make gifts to her children and/or to good causes,\u201d Egan explains.\n\nRetirement stars: five retirement stars ***** out of five\n\nemail andrew.allentuck@gmail.com for a free Family Finance analysis", "description": "$4.45 million in real estate are 85 per cent of her assets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/fp0914-family-finance.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
