YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\nOnce a busy mining area, now the gateway to Kruger as the only town on its borders, Ba-Phalaborwa is a unique enclave in Limpopo surrounded by protected areas.\n\nSoaring temperatures in summer, it's one of the warmest spots in South Africa during winter, making for ideal holidays when you want to escape the chill and maybe see a lion up close.\n\nBesides the wildlife, Ba-Phalaborwa is also a premier marula destination - the golden fruit entwined into Southern African culture that has its very own festival once a year. Jazz, gospel and dance come together to celebrate the harvest season around February and March once a year, turning the quiet town into a party mecca.\n\nWATCH: Celebrating the Marula fruit in Limpopo + other upcoming Africa events not to miss\n\nBut if you're looking for a quick getaway (the Phalaborwa airport makes this an easy escape) you can make the most of your stay with this one-day itinerary.\n\nDo an early morning drive through Kruger\n\nYou can't really get away from a drive through Kruger, and the best way to see the most animals is to get up early in the morning, head to the park's Phalaborwa Gate and catch them just before the sun starts to heat up the bush.\n\nIn summer that gate opens at 05:30 and in winter at 06:00, and you can either do a self-drive or book a guided drive with one of the plethora of tour operators available in Phalaborwa. These operators normally get to go into the park a little earlier, giving you more time to spot that elusive leopard.\n\nWATCH: Get wild with Mabula Game Lodge\n\nThe Phalaborwa Gate for Kruger National Park.

The whiskey is also really good for those who may not list the liquid gold high up when it comes to their preferred beverages.\n\nAt their tasting room you'll find out more about their process and do a tasting tour of all their offerings besides whiskey - from gin to vodka infusions like litchi, watermelon and coffee!\n\nWATCH: #MadeFromAfrica: Meet the face of Amarula in the Limpopo bush\n\nSome of the flavours in Qualito's whiskey.

At Kambaku Olifants River Safaris you can have some lunch at their expansive bar before taking a cruise down the river.\n\nIt borders right onto Kruger, and will give another opportunity to spot some game on the river's banks, like elephants and hippos, as well as a great spot for birders.\n\nREAD: Road tripping for the hops: Craft breweries of Limpopo and Mpumalanga\n\nOne of Kambaku's safari boats.

The hotel is named after a famous South African geologist who helped discover the phosphates and copper in Ba-Phalaborwa.\n\nIt's not the most glamorous stay a little behind the times of electronic check-in systems (avoid the busy season as the hotel gets overwhelmed at full capacity), but its gardens and pool area make for great relaxation spots after a long day exploring Ba-Phalaborwa.\n\nWATCH: This Limpopo bush lodge proves a luxe poolside experience is the best\n\nThe reception area.
