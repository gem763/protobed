Under Donald Trump, however, the situation has gotten a whole lot worse, reaching what the report calls \u201ca crisis point.\u201d\n\nNew York University\u2019s Brennan Centre for Justice published the 72-page report Friday, offering proposals for how the government can better safeguard federal scientific research and democracy itself, which is feeling fragile at the moment. Two main problems are threatening democracy: The politicisation of science and failing to appoint senior government officials.\n\nAll this is especially relevant under Trump, who denies climate science and has appointed individuals to high-ranking positions who do the same.\n\nWith the climate crisis hitting overdrive, the public needs reliable science to help guide and shape policy over the next couple of decades. Yet the Trump administration has taken a series of missteps when it comes to science.\n\nJust last month, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration supported Trump\u2019s false claims about Hurricane Dorian\u2019s forecast. Trump\u2019s attack on science also includes banning scientists with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from presenting research on climate change in October 2017, barring U.S. National Park Service employees from using the word \u201cclimate change\u201d in project proposals, and publishing a faulty environmental review for a proposed Alaskan mine that could threaten salmon, among other incidents.\n\nThe administration has also gone as far as to punish employees who speak out or formally complain about such anti-science directives through termination and job reassignment.\n\nUnfortunately, Trump is only exacerbating a problem that had been growing long before his presidency. Former U.S. presidents, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, also took steps to downplay the reality of climate change or the environmental impacts of extractive processes.\n\nBush supported opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling and misrepresented or ignored science that didn\u2019t support their case. Under Obama, the EPA downplayed the risk fracking could have on drinking water resources in a report.\n\nTo help prevent U.S. democracy \u2014 and the integrity of science \u2014 from falling apart further, the report authors recommend reducing the flow of money in politics. This proposal stands out because it\u2019s in line with a growing rally cry from the progressive left, especially from Democratic presidential candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe authors also call on U.S. Congress to step up and re-establish its role in the American system of checks and balances. It\u2019s up to Congress members to make the necessary reforms \u2014 be it restructuring the nomination and confirmation process or writing regulation to protect the public\u2019s access to government science and data.\n\nThe U.S. government is supposed to serve the interests of the American public. Nowadays, that\u2019s no longer the case, especially as it fails to act on the climate crisis that threatens humanity as a whole. Democracy is at stake here, and so is the future of the climate.", "description": "U.S. presidents have taken steps to breakdown the integrity of the science federal agencies produce, according to a new report.
