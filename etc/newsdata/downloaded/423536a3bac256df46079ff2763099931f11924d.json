Thank goodness for the presenters, eh!\n\nFor instance, we now know how much Prue hates mauve, thanks to Priya\u2019s \u2018nasty mauve\u2019 blueberry cream \u2013 and Prue\u2019s assessment came across somewhat cruel.\n\nThen again, it is week six and time to get down to serious business. After saying goodbye to both Helena and Michelle last week, it\u2019s beginning to feel like there\u2019s no more room to mess up. The playoffs are over and we should be getting into a more intense and gripping tent from now on.\n\nHaving said that, there was a distinct lack of sharpness this week, and it was almost an anticlimactic episode after the roaring 20s. This week\u2019s challenges were a bit dull and unoriginal and, in my opinion, should have been set much earlier on in the competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe started off with a \u2018simple\u2019 meringue, as the bakers put it, and were back to the recurring theme of substance before style. Henry cracked out a french twist, and nearly all of them were nutty, which was a slightly surprising angle. Most original idea from this round came from Michael inspiring himself with a Terry\u2019s Chocolate Orange.\n\nThe presentation of the meringues was stunning, and I often think the artwork department don\u2019t get enough credit for the beautiful illustrations showcasing how the final bake should look.\n\nThe problem is it can end up a bit like a Pinterest challenge with the reality looking nothing like the fantasy. Fortunately for our tent bakers, most were presentable, although Priya\u2019s aforementioned mauve and David\u2019s flavours weren\u2019t to the judges\u2019 taste.\n\nAlice, Michael and Rosie all suffered with chocolate overwhelm, so this is my takeaway from this week: meringue and chocolate is a tricky combo and a simple meringue needs to be just that \u2013 simple.\n\nPriya\u2019s exit was swiftly confirmed as Steph nabbed \u2018Star Baker\u2019 for a third week running (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nAs a side note, bonus points must go to Henry (my forever most stylish tent resident this season) who successfully matched his shirt and tie with his meringue decoration \u2013 I love red.\n\nI\u2019m a bit surprised that the bakers found the technical challenge to make a verrine tricky \u2013 it is quite an enjoyable and visually satisfying dessert to make although with Prue\u2019s vague instructions, I\u2019m sure it was a bit more stressful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPanna cotta is a pretty common dessert to have in a baker\u2019s repertoire, a bit like a Victorian sponge. Sable biscuits are similar to tackling shortbread and it was a bit disappointing that the hardest challenge was finding out if your biscuit fit the glass or not.\n\nI suppose from a judging perspective, a verrine means you can\u2019t hide behind anything. It\u2019s a 360 degree view of your work, and while it looks simple and should be simple in its execution, if you complicate the preparation it leaves room for lots of very visible mistakes.\n\nUnfortunately by this point in the proceedings, Birthday Boy Michael had already resigned himself to the fact that he was going. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happened to everyone\u2019s energy but the bakers definitely seem to be hitting a mid-season wall.\n\nThe Celebratory Bomb showpiece confirmed that this episode was focused on\u2026 the presentation of layers. Maybe chocolate too, but that\u2019s it.\n\nI liked that Stylish Henry was devising new ways of prepping his mousse layers, as aside from horse syringes, we\u2019ve been lacking some homemade innovative designs. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t perfectly executed, but the bigger picture shows it was a compliment to his skills as a baker to find out-of-the-box ways of tackling challenges.\n\nMeanwhile, the remaining boys were having their version of a water cooler chat by a fridge: \u2018The least laddy lad\u2019s club discussing gelatine setting temperatures\u2019. I think I\u2019d qualify for that club \u2013 where can I join?\n\nI was unfortunately not surprised to see Priya go this week (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nThe most gripping part of this episode was when the bakers turned their bombs out of their moulds \u2013 like children emptying out their buckets of sand on the beach and hoping for a perfectly four-turreted sandcastle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis held a certain amount of hypnotic power while we as a nation willed them to succeed \u2013 and succeed they did. I was surprised \u2013 and perhaps it\u2019s a little mean to say \u2013 almost disappointed there wasn\u2019t one disaster after such a build up. It\u2019s Bake Off after all.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure why Steph had stuck Doritos around her celebratory bomb, but that glaze was on point and \u2018one of the best things I\u2019ve had to eat for a long time,\u2019 according to Paul. I didn\u2019t think it was possible but that might be even better than a handshake?\n\nI rarely comment on production, but when Paul called Michael\u2019s bomb gaudy, and the camera panned to Priya glancing at her showpiece, felt more than a little like shady, and clunky foreshadowing from the producers.\n\nPriya\u2019s exit was swiftly confirmed as Steph nabbed \u2018Star Baker\u2019 for a third week running, and I was unfortunately not surprised to see Priya go this week, (especially after the editing tip-off) \u2013 and certainly less surprised than Henry.\n\nSmartest move for the week: I like that Henry had prepped his goodbye and \u2018what to nick from the tent\u2019 list! Apron, bowl and wooden spoon\u2026 he must be hoping to not get caught as I would have been trying to wheel a fridge freezer out of there!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext week is looking more promising, with the promise of Carnival and all things brightly coloured. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019ll bring some cheer to those grumpy judges.\n\nMORE: What it\u2019s like to be a Great British Bake Off contestant\n\nMORE: Bake Off emergency protocol: When in doubt, add alcohol\n\nMORE: When you have a Bake Off disaster, the GBBO tent is a lonely place", "description": "Former contestant Selasi Gbormittah shares his thoughts on the Great British Bake Off's dessert week", "authors": ["Selasi Gbormittah", "Great British Bake Off Semi-Finalist"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_87091138_1570018090.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
