You\u2019re happy to rave about a restaurant or lambaste your least favorite politician.\n\nOn the flip side, dreaded conversations keep you up at night: rejecting your adult child\u2019s repeated requests for money, demanding a refund from your contractor for shoddy work, alerting colleagues that you resent their ageist comments.\n\nRetirees may figure they\u2019ve earned the right to be blunt. But diplomacy still matters, especially if you want to settle a score without lasting rancor.\n\nIn the lead-up to these difficult encounters, you might fret, sweat and turn into a nervous wreck. Or you can prepare sensibly by planning what to say and how to say it.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the latter option.\n\nYou want to rise to the occasion, right? So use the acronym RISE as your road map:\n\nRaise your concern. Begin by saying, \u201cI\u2019d like to discuss something with you.\u201d Then pause, breathe evenly and, if you want to extend the courtesy, ask if this is a good time for them to talk.\n\n\u201cGetting their permission helps,\u201d said Dave Anderson, president of Learn to Lead, a leadership training firm in Agoura Hills, Calif.\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready to proceed, introduce the core issue clearly. Don\u2019t dance around it, over-explain or justify why you\u2019re bringing it up.\n\nSuccinctly summarize your concern, adding specificity if possible. Examples:\n\nI\u2019m concerned that you\u2019ve asked me three times this month for more money.\n\nI\u2019m not pleased with the quality of your masonry work on my chimney.\n\nI don\u2019t appreciate your references to my age in our last two board meetings.\n\nStrike a conversational tone, even if you\u2019re fuming inside. There\u2019s no need to come across as a scold.\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake is to make it a lecture that sounds condescending,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cDon\u2019t trot out your accountability voice\u201d where you act like a teacher telling a misbehaving student to get with the program.\n\nInvite their input. If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019ll want to keep talking so that you can elaborate on the problem, throw in a related (or unrelated) complaint or reveal how much you resent having to grapple with such a painful subject. Resist that urge.\n\nInstead, establish a speak-listen rhythm. Stop and ask them to chime in, because soliciting their feedback sets the stage for a more fruitful give-and-take. Examples:\n\nDo you see how this is a problem?\n\nCan you see why this concerns me?\n\nWhat do you think is a solution?\n\nListening to their reply might give you valuable information that can help you forge a reasonable compromise or mutually agreeable solution. And they\u2019re more apt to buy in if you let them vent or at least explain themselves.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t assume they see your concern as a problem,\u201d Anderson warned. \u201cIf they don\u2019t see it as a problem, they won\u2019t care about a solution to what they deem a non-issue.\u201d\n\nSuggest a solution. After you ask for their input and follow up with clarifying questions\u2014dignifying their views along the way\u2014you\u2019ll reach a point where you understand their perspective and you sense that they understand yours.\n\nThat\u2019s when you can propose a path forward. Examples:\n\nCan we agree that, instead of asking me for money in the year ahead, you will follow through on the three commitments you just made?\n\nSo I\u2019ll revise the contract\u2014and we\u2019ll both sign it by Friday\u2014so that it reflects the new price and new time frame for you to finish the job.\n\nTo confirm, you will not make such comments again?\n\nWatch your voice tone as you propose a solution. Remain polite but firm.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, you can start out well and then shift and get haughtier if others don\u2019t respond well and argue,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s when you start picking up a slightly higher, rattling voice tone\u201d that you risk sabotaging yourself by failing to mask your simmering sense of grievance.\n\nTo calm down and reduce the odds of ratcheting up tensions, Anderson advises \u201cgoing a little lower and a little slower.\u201d Adopting a lower, more resonant vocal pitch while speaking more slowly makes you sound more composed.\n\nExpress gratitude. End with a one-sentence statement of thanks. Examples:\n\nThank you for making this promise to me.\n\nThank you for being fair and resolving this.\n\nThank you for your willingness to address this.\n\nBy thanking them for agreeing to address the issue, you\u2019re bestowing advance praise for their forthcoming positive behavior. Better yet, you\u2019re putting them in a bind if they relapse.\n\n\u201cNow if they screw up again, it\u2019s not just the original issue but they\u2019ve also gone back on their word to resolve that issue,\u201d Anderson said.", "description": "Diplomacy matters if you want to settle the issue without drama.", "authors": ["Morey Stettner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ128_senior_ZG_20190826102355.jpg"}
