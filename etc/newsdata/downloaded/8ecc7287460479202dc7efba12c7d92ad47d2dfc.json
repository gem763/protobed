Add tripe and innards to lugaw, and it becomes goto; with chicken and saffron, it is arroz caldo. It\u2019s looser and soupier than Chinese congee, cooked until you can\u2019t see individual grains. I put in collard greens to make it a balanced meal and use wings because of the high bone-to-meat ratio and the jiggly skin. (Keeping the bones in will give the broth more flavor.) The soy sauce-cured yolks are probably best at the two-hour mark \u2014 they get firmer and saltier the longer they cure, so follow your taste.\n\nFeatured in: Angela Dimayuga\u2019s 10 Essential Filipino Recipes.", "description": "The Filipino rice porridge called lugaw started out as a simple equation of rice, water and salt, until the conquistadors arrived in the 16th century and demanded more sumptuous dishes Add tripe and innards to lugaw, and it becomes goto; with chicken and saffron, it is arroz caldo It\u2019s looser and soupier than Chinese congee, cooked until you can\u2019t see individual grains", "authors": ["Angela Dimayuga", "Daniel Patterson", "Sam Sifton", "Gabrielle Hamilton", "Julia Moskin", "Lidey Heuck", "Colu Henry", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Claire Saffitz", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipinorex4-arrozcaldo/merlin_160617603_99d443d0-b625-4a6e-b439-198c745fc79d-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
