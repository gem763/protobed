Our two best strikers scored, and that's important.\"\n\nIn second are Nantes, a respectable five points adrift of defending champions PSG who host Marseille on Sunday.\n\nEarlier, third-placed Lille had a bittersweet afternoon, satisfaction at their 3-0 win over Bordeaux tempered by injury to their in-form striker Victor Osimhen.\n\nThe Nigerian has scored in every home league game this season but was stretchered off in the second half with a left thigh injury.\n\n\"It could be troublesome,\" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier whose side are trailing their Champions League group led by Chelsea.\n\n\"He'd already felt a pain before (the match). I was going to take him off, but then he got injured. Is it serious? I don't know yet.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLille's win was largely crafted by Yusuf Yazici, their 16.5 million euros summer recruit from Trabzonspor who opened his account for his new employers with a penalty, and set up Benjamin Andre for the opener and Loic Remy's injury time contribution.\n\nIt moved them up to the top three from seventh, above Reims, who drew 0-0 with Nimes, and Angers, whose away day at Montpellier also ended goalless.\n\nBrest moved up to sixth courtesy of a 2-0 win over Dijon.\n\nOn Friday, prolific striker Wissam Ben Yedder grabbed his ninth goal of the season as Monaco handed Nantes their first home Ligue 1 defeat of the campaign.", "description": "Rudi Garcia tasted his first win since being appointed Lyon coach on Saturday when goals from Memphis Depay and Moussa Dembele earned his new side a 2-0 home success over Metz.
