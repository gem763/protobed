TDOC, -3.89% sank 7.0% in premarket trading Wednesday, in the wake of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.43% launching a pilot health care program that includes virtual and in-home care options. SVB Leerink analyst Daniel Grosslight said that while Amazon's new program may be perceived as a negative, he believes it is actually a \"major [long-term] tailwind\" for Teladoc. He reiterated his outperform rating and $90 stock price target, and recommends \"buying any weakness.\" Grosslight said while Amazon Care is just a pilot program for its employees, he could see Amazon rolling out a direct-to-consumer telehealth option to its 100 million Prime members. \"If they do, we think (like CVS) [Amazon] is more likely to partner with telehealth vendors such as [Teladoc] rather than manage a virtual provider network itself,\" Grosslight wrote in a note to clients. \"This would be a major new source of revenue for telehealth vendors, in our view.\" Teladoc's stock has soared 43.2% year to date through Tuesday, while the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF XLV, -1.13% has gained 4.8% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.12% has advanced 18.3%.", "description": "Shares of Teladoc Health Inc. sank 7.0% in premarket trading Wednesday, in the wake of Amazon.com Inc. launching a pilot health care program that includes...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
