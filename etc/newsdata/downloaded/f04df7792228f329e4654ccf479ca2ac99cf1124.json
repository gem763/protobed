Why are you on a constant crusade against our #LGBTQ students & teachers?\" Massachusetts Congresswoman Katherine Clark tweeted.\n\nSecretary @BetsyDeVosED, let's try this again: The Department of Education is responsible for ALL students.

Her itinerary includes a school that bans transgender students and staff,\" the transgender advocacy group \"Trans Lash Media\" tweeted.\n\nLGBTQ groups protested DeVos when she first became President Trump's pick for education secretary, because of her support for some conservative religious groups that promote what they consider to be traditional family values \u2014 including one organization that supports conversion therapy. DeVos said she never supported conversion therapy, a widely discredited approach to counseling gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people with the aim of changing their sexual orientation.\n\nDeVos has also stirred up criticism for proposing cuts to public education funding, with an aim of shifting billions of dollars to private, parochial and charter schools. She promotes the concept of \"school choice\" \u2014 offering parents options other than traditional public schools, where 90 percent of kids go.\n\nDuring her visit to Harrisburg Catholic Elementary, DeVos attended what was billed as an \"Education Freedom roundtable\" with Pennsylvania Speaker of the House Mike Turzai. The event was cohosted by the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference and the Diocese of Harrisburg, according to the press release.\n\nThe focus of the roundtable was not on gender identity, but rather a vetoed bill that would have provided 52,000 low-income students in the state with tuition-free private school.", "description": "\"Why are you on a constant crusade against our #LGBTQ students & teachers?\" one lawmaker fired at DeVos", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/09/13/2d25bd97-128e-4604-beb5-49fc150c8f4f/thumbnail/1200x630/e40bd890e12325e396f0e73802de9560/gettyimages-687808708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
