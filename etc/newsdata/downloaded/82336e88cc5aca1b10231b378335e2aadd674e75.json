When the personal care company\u2019s stock fell 29 percent at the end of August, Ulta\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Mary Dillon revealed a lack of innovation in the beauty industry and a shifting consumer base as factors that hurt makeup sales.\n\nStocks in this Article ULTA ULTA BEAUTY INC. $234.08 -2.83 (-1.19%)\n\n\u201cAfter several years of very strong performance, growth in the makeup category has been decelerating over the last two years for recently turned negative. Based on the latest track data the cosmetics category in the total U.S. market has experienced mid single-digit declines through the first six months of 2019 and has been more volatile in recent weeks,\u201d Dillon told shareholders in Ulta\u2019s second quarter earnings call.\n\nShe went on to add, \u201cOver the past several years, we've seen strong growth in cosmetics driven by new rituals and application techniques like contouring and brow styling and innovative new product formats like Liquid Lip, Palette and Minis. This innovation resulted a new makeup routines requiring new products, which drove strong incremental growth.\u201d\n\nHowever, with more and more consumers embracing their natural beauty and prioritizing clean living and wellness, there aren\u2019t enough makeup trends to encourage sales.\n\nAdd in celebrity movements led by singers like Alicia Keys - many makeup users are foregoing a morning makeup routine.\n\nIn contrast to makeup\u2019s decline, the skincare category has grown exponentially thanks to the rise of natural beauty. What was once driven by mature shoppers wishing to turn back the clock with serums and antiaging aging topicals has now expanded to the younger generations who are trying preventative measures \u2013 whether it be for acne, dullness or fine lines.\n\nStocks in this Article LRLCY L'OR\u00c9AL S.A. $52.82 -0.26 (-0.49%)\n\nAccording to L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s 2018 Annual Report, skincare accounted for 39 percent of the whole beauty market while makeup accounted for 19 percent. Moreover, the skincare market grew approximately by nine percent in 2018. Based off of L'Or\u00e9al\u2019s records, this is a three percent increase from 2017 and a 5.6 percent increase from 2016.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also broke down this non-makeup market into four key categories: Facial skincare, face cleansers, body care and sun protection.\n\nIn the report\u2019s own words, \u201cThe skincare market accelerated sharply in 2018, boosted by the expansion of the upper middle classes all over the world and especially in Asia, where consumers are both knowledgeable and enthusiastic about this category.\u201d\n\nSkincare\u2019s growing hold on the market has contributed to the birth of a new industry as well \u2013 fast beauty.\n\nThe INKEY List, which only launched last year, is one industry disruptor that has made it to Sephora shelves as a prestige brand with drug store price points.

Even ecommerce giant Amazon has leaned into the trend earlier this year with an exclusive partnership with Fast Beauty Co., a skincare collection that\u2019s aiming to take a swipe at cosmetic dollars.\n\nJust like fast fashion, the keys to fast beauty include rapid product launches, social media prowess, scarcity, hype and budget-friendly pricing \u2013 all of which encourage shoppers to place orders and live in excess so they don't risk missing out.\n\nDespite skincare\u2019s takeover, makeup hasn\u2019t been killed off. Trends have indicated that there are a fair amount of people who have pared down their extensive routines and blurred the lines of makeup and skincare with \u201cno makeup\u201d makeup looks.\n\nThe desire to look like one has just rolled out of bed looking flawless has helped some cosmetic brands rake in fortunes with their light coverage product lines.\n\nGlossier, which was founded in 2010 by Vogue styling assistant turned entrepreneur Emily Weiss, reached its $1.2 billion company valuation in March, according to the Wall Street Journal. The minimalistic, direct-to-consumer blog employs an advertorial business model with its namesake cosmetics line, which has become a smash hit due to its promise to \u201cnever cover you up, turn you into someone else, or overcomplicate your routine.\u201d\n\nModels at Glossier sport bare faces or sheer foundation that lets their real skin shine through, and if Glossier\u2019s numbers are anything to go by, the message has really resonated with the market.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSimilar tactics have been used with hip brands like the teen-founded \u201ctouch n go\u201d makeup crayons known as Nudestix and the studio-founded, photo-friendly cosmetics line known as Milk Makeup.\n\nDuring Ulta\u2019s earnings call, the company cited strategic influencer partnerships as the makeup category\u2019s saving grace.
