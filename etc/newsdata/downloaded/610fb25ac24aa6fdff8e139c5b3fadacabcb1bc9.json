Filmmaker Martin Scorsese has offered his take on the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it turns out he\u2019s not really a fan:\n\nThe director of films such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas told Empire magazine that his attempts to get up to speed with contemporary superhero films had failed. \u201cI tried, you know?\u201d the director said when asked if he had seen Marvel\u2019s movies. \u201cBut that\u2019s not cinema.\u201d He continued: \u201cHonestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d\n\nI should say up front that I\u2019ve seen a bunch of Scorsese\u2019s movies and it\u2019s beyond question that he\u2019s a great director. In addition, I enjoy listening to him talk about movies almost as much as I enjoy watching his films. He\u2019s clearly a master of the subject and often has interesting things to say. That\u2019s why I find it so odd that he\u2019s so off base in this case.\n\nYou can certainly define \u201ccinema\u201d in such a way that Iron Man and the Avengers aren\u2019t part of it. If cinema means making dark films about gangsters then lots of things won\u2019t qualify. If cinema means making gritty, realistic dramas then, fine, Marvel is out of the running. But if cinema means the kind of movies that have been popular with large audiences for as long as people have been going to movie theaters, then Scorsese is clearly wrong. Here\u2019s my rebuttal to his argument:\n\nKing Kong was the superhero movie of its day, a special effects-heavy spectacle film with an implausible plot. Like superhero movies today, Kong was fantastically successful at the box office in 1933 but was nominated for no major award from the Academy. It\u2019s regarded as a great film by a lot of critics past and present. Is it \u201ccinema?\u201d I guess it doesn\u2019t qualify under Scorsese\u2019s view.\n\nHere\u2019s my next response:\n\nThis is a musical comedy that is not heavy on conveying emotional, psychological experiences. It\u2019s meant to make you laugh. And again, it\u2019s considered by many critics to be a great comedy, one of the best ever made. But is it Cinema?\n\nWhat about Charlie Chaplin\u2019s The Circus or Hitchcock\u2019s North by Northwest? These arguably have more in common with Marvel popcorn movies tonally than with Taxi Driver. They\u2019re also a lot more fun to watch. What about Adventures of Robin Hood or Dracula? These films aren\u2019t terribly realistic in any sense. Robin Hood has a love story but it also has a lot of sword fighting and archery worthy of a Marvel\u2019s Hawkeye. Seriously, tell me this isn\u2019t 1938\u2019s version of the Avengers:\n\nI could go on for a very long time. The history of Hollywood is full of really great horror movies, thrillers, comedies, and action films that people still love decades later despite the fact that they are mostly just entertainment and not terribly deep. I don\u2019t know if those films count as cinema in Scorsese\u2019s view but added all together they probably account for a majority of the films ever made including all of the most popular ones at the box office.\n\nMarvel\u2019s movies may have a lot in common with amusement parks, but what\u2019s wrong with that? According to the most recent numbers available, half a billion people (worldwide) visited a theme park last year. Not every film has to be Goodfellas. Sometimes people just want to relax and watch Roy Rogers or the Avengers.\n\nUpdate: James Gunn, writer and director of Guardians of the Galaxy is disappointed:", "description": "\"...that\u2019s not cinema.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Scorsese.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
