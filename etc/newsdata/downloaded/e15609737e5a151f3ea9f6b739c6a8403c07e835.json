School is not a place for sex, and if you bought condoms there, people would gossip about you.\n\nMichael Kwok Pui-hin, 15, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nBeing able to buy condoms at school is a good way to introduce safe sex. A school wouldn\u2019t sell condoms without providing sex education to its students. This way, students would learn the proper way of using condoms.\n\nNot all parents can give good advice about sex to their children. Students shouldn\u2019t be having babies. If students have condoms, it can prevent teenage pregnancy, as well as sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nEdward Wong Kwan-ho, 16, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nIf we were able to buy condoms at school, it would mean that the school has basically said it\u2019s OK for young adults to have sex. So I think students should not be able to buy condoms at school.\n\nCharis Chan Chi-ching, 9, St Francis of Assisi\u2019s English Primary School\n\nNo, we shouldn\u2019t! Schools can provide information about condoms and where to get them, but they should not be distributed on campus. In many countries, the health department distributes condoms. If teachers provide condoms, they will be seen as promoting sexual activity.\n\nArthur Fan, 15, Kwok Tak Seng Catholic Secondary School\n\nWe should not be able to buy condoms at school. In a normal school, there should be no sexual activity. Everyone knows that school is not the place for sex, so it should not sell condoms. By selling condoms, schools would be encouraging sexual activity, so we should not be able to buy them at school.\n\nLily Cheng Tak-yan, 15, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nStudents should not be able to buy condoms at school. Schools should sell some healthy snacks instead of things we won\u2019t use there.\n\nJerry Chan, 14, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nI don\u2019t think schools should sell condoms to students, because school is a place for learning. Condoms are for adult, and students should not be using them, they should by concentrating on their studies.\n\nSteve Kong, 15, Law Ting Pong Secondary School.\n\nWe should be able to buy condoms at school, because teenagers during adolescence are curious about everything, and they might want to imitate adults by having a boy/girl friend. If they do not buy condoms in a convenience store, they might have unprotected sex, which could lead to pregnancy or diseases. If teenagers want to have sex, they should be able to buy condoms at school to prevent accidents.\n\nKelvin Chong Tsz-kin, 15, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nWe should not able to buy condoms in our school, because the students are teenagers and if they know they can buy condoms they may try to have sex in school. Then when they grow up they might bring condoms to work, and have sex with colleagues, which would make society very strange.\n\nSandy Chung Cheuk-yung, 15, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nNo, we shouldn\u2019t be able to buy condoms at school, because this would only encourage students to have sex. The students\u2019 curiosity could lead to serious consequences.\n\nOur topics always get a lot of responses. Check out what other students had to say and join the conversation at yp.scmp.com.
