The Judiciary Committee argued in late July that their impeachment investigation satisfies one of the exceptions to federal grand jury secrecy rules: that the House is engaged in an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d and therefore is taking an action preliminary to a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d \u2014 the Senate\u2019s trial on whether to remove Trump from office.\n\nBut the Justice Department rebuffed that claim on Friday, citing inconsistent statements from senior Democratic leaders \u2014 as well as their own claims that the ongoing investigation might lead to innumerable outcomes other than an impeachment vote.\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s own description of its investigation makes clear that it is too far removed from any potential judicial proceeding to qualify,\u201d the filing states.\n\n\u201cAs the committee\u2019s chairman has stressed\u2014and as the speaker of the House and the House majority leader both reiterated this week\u2014the purpose of its investigation is to assess numerous possible remedial measures, including censure, articles of impeachment, legislation, Constitutional amendments, and more,\u201d it continues. \u201cWhat may come of this investigation\u2014if anything\u2014remains unknown and unpredictable.\u201d\n\nSenior Democrats expressed concern this week that the lack of a unified message on impeachment could hurt their prospects in court, as they seek access to Mueller\u2019s secret files and testimony from his key witnesses, which they say is necessary in order to determine whether Trump should be impeached.\n\nEven if a judge determined that the House activities were close enough to a preliminary impeachment probe, the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers went further, arguing that impeachment itself \u2014 and a removal trial in the Senate \u2014 would still fall short of an exception to grand jury secrecy.\n\n\u201c[I]mpeachment proceedings in Congress \u2014 including hypothetical removal proceedings in the Senate \u2014 are not \u2018judicial proceedings\u2019 under the plain and ordinary meaning of that term,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe filing comes a day after the committee approved a set of technical procedures for its impeachment investigation, the most significant legislative move yet in Democrats\u2019 potential effort to oust the president. Impeachment supporters said approving the parameters was a historic embrace of ongoing impeachment proceedings, but other Democrats \u2014 including Pelosi \u2014 publicly downplayed the move.\n\nThe messaging whiplash highlighted some Democrats\u2019 reluctance to embrace the \u201cimpeachment\u201d moniker, amid competing political priorities within the House Democratic Caucus. Moderate Democrats, particularly those who are vulnerable in 2020, have shied away from impeachment talk, while the party\u2019s progressive base has urged Pelosi and her leadership team to adopt a more aggressive posture.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) initially offered a flat \u201cno\u201d this week when asked if an impeachment investigation had begun, even though he had signed off on the House\u2019s legal filings which stated otherwise. He later walked back those comments. And the No. 5 House Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, on Wednesday said he wasn\u2019t sure whether an impeachment investigation had begun, before voting to support it on Thursday.\n\nLast month, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said his panel was engaged in \u201cformal impeachment proceedings,\u201d a rhetorical escalation that echoed what House lawyers had told federal judges in recent court filings. Nadler has also said that if the courts move quickly to address the House litigation, his committee could recommend articles of impeachment by the end of the year. The Justice Department cited Nadler\u2019s comments in its filing on Friday.", "description": "The filing comes a day after the committee approved a set of technical procedures for its impeachment investigation.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HxeOGoeDnVJfg8AQLIGyfg--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/a268e5f7dedfc514b245d6946897d7da", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
