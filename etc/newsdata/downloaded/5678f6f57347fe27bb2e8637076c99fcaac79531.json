It will use its own trucks to fulfill car delivery orders previously handled by United Logistics and Beijing Glovis.Through the agreement, Jiangsu Gelian Logistics, 51 percent owned by the Beijing unit of Hyundai Glovis and the rest by United Logistics, is expected to conduct deliveries for customers of United Logistics, including Geely and Guangzhou Automobile Industry Group.Hyundai Glovis said the new venture will be handling large delivery volumes from the traditional catchment areas of United Logistics and Hyundai Glovis.The joint venture is also tasked with finding new business opportunities in procurement and import-export logistics.United Logistics was established in 2011 and currently has 17 branches throughout the country. The company reported 1.8 billion yuan ($254.8 million) in sales in 2017 and shipped around 1.95 million cars throughout the country last year.Hyundai Glovis said it believes the latest partnership will help it increase profits and stabilize its reach in the Chinese market.
