At press time, the sale price is worth 182.34 Bitcoins.\n\nBuilt in 1871, the converted residential property is the former St. Laurence\u2019s Church in County Durham.\n\nEarlier this year, Cointelegraph reported that major Bitcoin-oriented real estate project Aston Plaza was pausing its operations, while previous reports claimed that the construction of the $325 million venture was stopped in January 2018. According to the Aston Plaza website, the venture still offers studios as well as one- and two-bedroom apartments that can be bought with Bitcoin.\n\nU.K. and payments in crypto\n\nThe U.K. has been friendly to crypto-powered payments, according to recent reports. Last week, major local crypto wallet and debit card service firm Cryptopay announced the launch of transfers with the British pound through the Faster Payments Scheme, which purportedly eliminated euro conversion charges.\n\nIn April 2019, the U.K.\u2019s largest travel management company, Corporate Traveller, announced that it started accepting Bitcoin for payments, noting that the firm is not concerned with Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility, as received crypto is converted directly into British pounds.", "description": "A British real estate firm is accepting Bitcoin for the sale of a 150-year-old church that was converted into residential property", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9jOWE5MjRhOWFmZGQ4ZDk4ZDNiMmEzNjFjMDRlMmQ3ZC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
