I would describe my level of risk tolerance as moderate. My current AA target is approx. 75/25, stocks-to-bonds/cash. I'm a bit below that now with the stock market doing well AND I do not have any plans to alter my AA because of an \"impending\" recession. in other words, I am not raising any significant cash even though I \"try\" to be as contrarian as possible; it appears to work more often than not. I have a few \"extra\" dollars that I want to invest and adding to my \"cash\" position now does not make much sense to me. SO, I decided i should add to my Bond position and get closer to my 25% target allocation. This may seem to fly in the face of my \"contrarian\" statement, but I do NOT believe we are going into a recession this year and maybe not even next year (mostly conjecture on my part). As a result, for the time being, bonds seem to be a more reasonable place to make a \"few\" extra dollars while my stock positions continue to appreciate (I hope) during the foreseeable future. For the most part I use my bond positions as a mitigator. Of course I welcome some appreciation; I am more interested in total return than \"income\". I also look for investments that do not necessarily always move in the same direction or at the same velocity. Complimentary would be my best description. Furthermore, I do look for investments that have solid metrics including some downside protection and competitive returns; they do not have to be the \"best-in-class\". If I have not sufficiently answered you questions, please ask again; eventually I will get it right (LOL). Thanks for your input and interest in helping me make better decisions!!!\n\nBased on that info, especially your 75/25 split and your statements, \"I also look for investments that do not necessarily always move in the same direction or at the same velocity. Complimentary would be my best description,\" you seem to be looking for bond funds with low correlation to stocks to act as ballast.\n\nText book holdings given all that would be a long bond fund like WHOSX (that is absolutely rocking in 2019 but may be at the end of that run) or an intermediate core bond fund like WAPIX (that is also on a great YTD run but likely nearing the end) or an IG Corp bond fund like PIGIX (also rocking the casbah in 2019).\n\nAlternatively, you could simply add another very good multi-sector bond fund like the two you own or the others you are considering adding. I would suggest looking at any/all that you've already listed and also add PTIAX to that list.\n\nGoing the multi-sector bond route likely exposes you to bond categories that you might rather avoid given your relatively high 75% stock allocation.\n\nIf not for the BIG run in longs, intermediates and corps this year, funds like WHOSX, WAPIX and/or PIGIX would seem to be slam dunk suggestions. Given their respective recent runs though, I'd tread lightly with any/all of these but still feel relatively comfortable with all at least through YE.", "description": "During recent months I've been contemplating what to pair with JMUTX/JMUIX.
