Here\u2019s a little bit of our chat with The Bachelor 2019 runner-up Abbie Chatfield.\n\nPTV: Did you expect the show to have so much you in it?\n\nA: No! I would call Tim [publicist] every time like, \u201cAm I in this one, please tell me I\u2019m not!\u201d And he would be like \u201cDarl, that\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d\n\nA: It was so hard like everyone in the media, all the girls were like, \u201cAbbie is loving the publicity.\u201d I was not! I called the cops on the paparazzi the other day. I was not into this.\n\nPTV: What happened?!\n\nA: Oh he was just driving so erratically behind me. But yeah, I haven\u2019t gone out over the past month. I haven\u2019t liked this at all. It hasn\u2019t been fun.\n\nPTV: So were you happy with the way you were being portrayed as a confident woman?\n\nA: I think my confidence was really overplayed. It\u2019s really funny watching it back and people being like, \u201cYou\u2019re so confident, YAAAS.\u201d [laughs] Like I was crying before every rose ceremony. I tried to leave like six times, like \u201che hates me, he hates me, he hates me\u201d I was not confident until hometowns. So it was funny watching it back and hearing these soundbites over the top of rose ceremonies like \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d Because I was not like that, that was not how I felt. I was just putting on a face for the camera because I was not confident at all.\n\nPTV: So what made you want to leave?\n\nA: Oh, I just felt so isolated in the house. I felt like my only real friends were the producers and my makeup artist and I love them but I just felt like \u2013 I just felt like everyone was talking about me all the time.\n\nA: One time a producer asked me if \u201cDo you think you just don\u2019t get along with women?\u201d and I was like, \u201cOh no, all my friends are women\u201d and I went to an all-girls school and I never had an issue making friends. It was just a really strange environment and that\u2019s what made me kind of want to leave a few times. And I just kept being like, \u201cIf you leave now, you\u2019ll never know what happens with Matt.\u201d\n\nPTV: And why do you think the girls had such an issue with you? Re: Monique, Sogand, Elly?\n\nA: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. The thing is that when Matt confronted me about what Elly said \u2013 it\u2019s like, give me a direct quote about what Elly said so I can explain it. But he didn\u2019t so I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t explain to you why people feel this way because no one has quoted me saying these things.\u201d\n\nA: And if there was a quote that was said, I could easily explain it to him. I never really heard what those quotes were except talking about Bachelor in Paradise which was my running joke in the house. I\u2019d always go \u201cThere\u2019s always BiP, darl!\u201d Like as a bit of banter and then everybody just took it at such a serious level.\n\nPTV: If there was one thing you\u2019d like people, particularly women, to take away from your time on The Bachelor, what would it be?\n\nA: Probably just to not shy away from your sexuality and not to feel bad about feeling confident. And don\u2019t feel like you need to be insecure, or meek, or ladylike to be loved. I think just completely be yourself whether that is humping a man on the beach, take your sexuality for what it is.", "description": "Screw the intro, let's get straight to it.
