NBC News maintains that Farrow had no Weinstein accusers on the record at the time in August 2017 when they parted ways on the story. Farrow asserts that NBC News first suggested that he try to find another editorial home for his story. NBC News maintains Farrow asked for the right to go to another publication.\n\nFarrow makes a case that NBC News and its practices around harassment complaints and settlements were part of a broader culture of cover-up and protection for wealthy and powerful predators. NBC News president Noah Oppenheim is depicted in particularly unflattering light as Farrow pursued his investigation in the summer and fall of 2017.\n\nFarrow also details a history of alleged affairs and settlements involving NBC News chairman Andy Lack in the 1980s and \u201890s. He describes MSNBC president Phil Griffin as allegedly engaging in boorish behavior with female colleagues, and he faults Lack, Griffin and Oppenheim for communicating with Weinstein and his legal team about the status of the story while Farrow was knee-deep in reporting. Farrow suggests that Oppenheim was concerned about fallout from taking on Weinstein on his future prospects as a screenwriter. A longtime news producer, Oppenheim shifted into unscripted TV production and screenwriting for several years before he returned to NBC News in 2015. He was promoted to NBC News president in February 2017.\n\nFarrow reports that Weinstein\u2019s assistants came to refer to Lack, Oppenheim and Griffin as \u201cthe triumvirate\u201d because Weinstein was calling them so often in 2017 as his reputation and company began to unravel. In October 2017, exposes in the New York Times and Farrow\u2019s reports in the New Yorker led to Weinstein\u2019s downfall. He is now facing criminal charges in New York, with a trial set to begin in January.\n\nWeinstein, according to Farrow, tried to pressure NBC News with damning information on \u201cToday\u201d anchor Matt Lauer that he received from the parent company of the National Enquirer. Lauer was fired in November 2017, as Variety reported troubling allegations of a pattern of sexual misconduct claims against the longtime anchor. \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d includes details for the first time of the horrifying anal rape allegation against Lauer from former NBC News staffer Brooke Nevils that prompted his firing. Lauer has denied the allegation and called his relationship with Nevils \u201cconsensual.\u201d\n\nNBC calls Farrow\u2019s suggestion that the network looked the other way amid reports of Lauer\u2019s behavior \u201cabsolutely false\u201d and denies being involved in any sexual harassment settlements on the anchor\u2019s behalf prior to his firing. \u201cOnly following his termination did we reach agreements with two women who had come forward for the very first time and those women have always been free to share their stories about Lauer with anyone they choose,\u201d NBC News said in a statement.\n\nOn the subject of National Enquirer parent company AMI trying to pressure NBC News on Lauer, NBC said in a statement that they were \u201cnever contacted by AMI, or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter. And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity.\u201d\n\nNBC has been bracing for the Oct. 15 publication of Farrow\u2019s book and has mounted a vigorous rebuttal to some of his assertions. Oppenheim disputes the characterization that he \u201ckilled\u201d the story. Farrow, in his view, was not a full-time NBC News employee, but rather working off a contract after the MSNBC daytime series he anchored in 2014 and 2015 was canceled.\n\n\u201cWe are more confident now than ever in the decisions we made around Ronan\u2019s reporting,\u201d Oppenheim told Variety. \u201cHe is entitled to disagree with the decisions we made but he\u2019s not entitled to his own set of facts.\u201d\n\nOppenheim and others at NBC News maintain that they were trying to work with Farrow on getting the sourcing needed to make the story reportable on-air.\n\n\u201cAt every turn we tried to widen the group of reporters and editors working on the story,\u201d Oppenheim says. \u201cAt times he was utterly dismissive of efforts to get at the story in different ways.\u201d\n\nThe material Farrow gathered after months of work on the story was reviewed by a team of NBC News investigative veterans in early August 2017. The biggest hurdle was that he had no accusers on camera naming Weinstein. Farrow\u2019s first Oct. 10, 2017, report on Weinstein in the New Yorker had allegations from multiple women who were not included in the reporting that he presented to NBC News.\n\nFarrow maintains that by August 2017 he was barred from conducting more interviews with sources in the Weinstein investigation. NBC News said it blocked Farrow from using a camera crew because he had already informed them he was taking the story to another outlet. NBC asserts that the interview was to be shot with the accuser speaking anonymously and in shadow, which would not be enough to get the story over the hurdle for air.\n\n\u201cHis reporting wasn\u2019t anywhere near ready for airing. There was not a victim on the record,\u201d said Rich Greenberg, head of NBC News\u2019 investigative unit. Farrow was also \u201coverstating his sourcing\u201d in some instances, Greenberg says. \u201cIt was unanimous in the (August) review that the story was not ready.\u201d\n\nFarrow states in the book that one of the \u201cDateline\u201d executives who reviewed his work was veteran executive producer David Corvo, who was allegedly the focus of a 2007 harassment claim from a woman that led to a $1 million settlement years later, which NBC paid the day after Corvo reviewed Farrow\u2019s work. NBC in a statement disputed that the complaint involving Corvo was the source of the settlement with the employee.\n\n\u201cThe individual\u2019s departure over a decade later and any compensation paid was completely unrelated to the complaint,\u201d NBC said.\n\nOppenheim is portrayed in \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d as downplaying the significance of an audio recording that Farrow obtained of Italian model Ambra Gutierrez as she tried to rebuff Weinstein\u2019s effort to bring her into his New York hotel room in March 2015. The exchange presents Weinstein as both desperate and threatening, and it makes reference to an earlier incident in which Weinstein touched Gutierrez\u2019s breasts. Farrow quotes Oppenheim, after listening to the recording, as questioning whether Weinstein\u2019s actions amounted to a \u201ccrime.\u201d \u201cHarvey Weinstein grabbing a lady\u2019s breasts a couple of years ago, that\u2019s not national news,\u201d Oppenheim said, according to Farrow.\n\nOppenheim also told Farrow that the recording and his Weinstein reporting would force them to \u201cmake some decisions \u2026 like, is this really worth it?\u201d\n\nFarrow accuses Oppenheim of trying to slow down his reporting process by raising the question of his having a conflict of interest on the story because of his family\u2019s past ties to Weinstein and the allegation that his sister, Dylan Farrow, was molested by their father, filmmaker Woody Allen. Oppenheim presented a 1990s news story in the Los Angeles Times about Miramax rallying behind Allen to distribute his movies after the molestation allegation. Ronan Farrow has been outspoken in his support of his sister\u2019s account of the 1992 incident.\n\nFarrow challenged the assertion that this presented a conflict of interest. Oppenheim says he raised it not as a roadblock, but as a concern that Farrow needed to keep in mind. He also made a risque comment that caused Farrow concern.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be happier if (Weinstein) found video of you f\u2014ing in a bathroom or something,\u201d Oppenheim tells Farrow, according to \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d\n\nOppenheim counters that Farrow began to pressure NBC News to rush the story on the air because he feared he would be beaten on the Weinstein story by the New York Times, which was also working on an expose. Farrow made it clear within NBC that he was concerned about earning credit for bringing down a major film industry figure.\n\n\u201cHe felt a sense of urgency and competitive pressure,\u201d Oppenheim said. \u201cHe was concerned about getting credit. He said \u2018I\u2019ll get scooped and no one will ever know I worked on this.\u2019\u201d\n\nFarrow in the book said his exchanges with Oppenheim left him with the feeling that the network was trying to quietly squelch the story.\n\n\u201cI had to ask direct questions to expose the space between what he was willing to say and what he was willing to imply,\u201d Farrow wrote.\n\nOppenheim and others involved with the story at NBC News vehemently deny that they tried to stop him from pursuing Weinstein.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019ve asked of Ronan is that he tell the truth \u2014 that when he left NBC he did not have a single victim or witness to misconduct by Weinstein willing to go on the record and that is why a large circle of his colleagues, including the head of the investigative unit and two of the most seasoned investigative reporters in the newsroom, all agreed that he did not yet have a story that was ready for air,\u201d Oppenheim said.\n\nFarrow describes in detail the turmoil he felt as he came to believe that NBC was working against him. He describes walking through the \u201cToday\u201d newsroom after a meeting with Oppenheim with \u201cbattery acid in my mouth and red parenthesis in my palms where I had pressed nails into skin.\u201d", "description": "NBC News and its leadership are painted in an extremely dark light in Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book, \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d", "authors": ["Cynthia Littleton", "Business Editor", "Cynthia'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "top_image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ronan-farrow-noah-oppenheim-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
