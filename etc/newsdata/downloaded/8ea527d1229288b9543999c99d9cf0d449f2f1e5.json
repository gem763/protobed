And a new Iowa poll has her in first place.\n\nBut now she\u2019s a target.\n\nWarren, a senator from Massachusetts, has risen to the point where voters and reporters are both scrutinizing her record. She\u2019s also becoming the focus of attacks from rivals concerned about her momentum.\n\nUnaffiliated Democrats say Warren\u2019s campaign has consistently impressed them.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just doing a lot of the right things,\u201d said J.D. Scholten, a Democratic congressional candidate from Iowa\u2019s Fourth District.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s run an almost perfect campaign,\u201d said Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an energy at her events that\u2019s very appealing,\u201d said Judy Reardon, a veteran Democratic strategist in New Hampshire.\n\nWarren\u2019s rise has been due to her discipline. She sticks to her stump speech, avoids being dragged into frivolous debates and maintains a cheerful can-do persona even while indicting the American political system. Until recently, however, she has mostly avoided hard questions, especially about her Medicare for All plan.\n\nHer rivals hope to change that.\n\nIn a Sept. 19 CNN interview, Pete Buttigieg attacked Warren for being \u201cextremely evasive\u201d in explaining how she\u2019d pay for her health-care plan. Even late-night comedian Stephen Colbert pressed her on whether middle-class taxes would rise to finance that proposal.\n\nOther campaigns have urged reporters to scrutinize Warren\u2019s work as a consultant to large corporations such as Dow Corning, in hopes of tarnishing her reformer image. Some Wall Street analysts have begun warning that Warren\u2019s rise represents a serious market risk.\n\nWhile she is personally popular with Democrats, many voters harbor doubts about some of her positions. A Sept. 22 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 62% oppose providing government health insurance to undocumented immigrants and 56% oppose switching to a single-payer health care system that eliminates private insurance.\n\nBeyond DNA Tests\n\nThat\u2019s a sharp change from a year ago, when Warren drew widespread criticism for releasing the results of a DNA test intended to prove her American Indian ancestry and plummeted in the polls.\n\n\u201cIt looks she\u2019s finished,\u201d President Donald Trump told Fox News in March. And on April 15, a Los Angeles Times/USC poll showed her at 4% support.\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t. Since then, Warren and her campaign have engineered a series of successes.\n\nOn April 19, citing the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Warren became the first major Democratic candidate to call on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump \u2014 a move that brought her a fundraising bonanza and presaged a shift in Democratic sentiment toward supporting impeachment.\n\nA week later, Warren was the consensus standout at the She the People forum in Houston, a presidential gathering attended by women of color, impressing attendees with detailed plans to address issues such as maternal mortality.\n\nThroughout the summer, Warren kept up a hectic campaign schedule.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been here a lot,\u201d Sullivan says of Warren, who returns to New Hampshire again this week. \u201cAnd when she\u2019s here, I\u2019ve never seen her have a bad speech or be flat \u2014 she\u2019s always good, she\u2019s always on message.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, many of her Democratic rivals have had bad days amid the good. Front-runner Joe Biden has committed a string of gaffes and seen his record on race and criminal justice issues attacked by challengers, and now Trump. Beto O\u2019Rourke had an Icarus-like fall. Kamala Harris reset her campaign strategy last week to overcome her self-described \u201csummer slump.\u201d\n\nPoll Numbers Climb\n\nAs Democrats flocked to the Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry on Saturday, a new Des Moines Register/CNN poll of Iowa voters found that Warren has risen to a two-point lead over Biden, with room to grow her support. More respondents, 71%, said they were considering supporting her than any other candidate in the field. Biden was second with 60% considering him.\n\nBut Warren could have trouble extending her good-times stretch, which one veteran strategist likened to a hitting streak in baseball. \u201cIt gets harder when you\u2019re a front-runner because there\u2019s a target on your back,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cOther candidates who feel they\u2019re in need of a boost may come after you.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Elizabeth Warren has been on a steady upward trajectory for six months, raising big money from small donors, drawing huge crowds, and rising from also-ran to top-tier.
