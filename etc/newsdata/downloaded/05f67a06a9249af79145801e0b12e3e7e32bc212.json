Dressed in a dark orange robe whose design dates back 1,000 years, Japan\u2019s 126th emperor paid tribute to 85-year-old Akihito\u2019s dedication to public service and said he would continue his father\u2019s work.\n\nNaruhito vowed to act according to the postwar constitution, which regards the reigning emperor as a \u201csymbol of the sate and of the unity of the people, while always wishing for the happiness of the people and the peace of the world, turning my thoughts to the people and standing by them\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI sincerely hope that our country, through our people\u2019s wisdom and unceasing efforts, achieves further development and contributes to the friendship and peace of the international community and the welfare and prosperity of humankind.\u201d\n\nFacing Naruhito from a position below the imperial throne, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offered his congratulations. \u201cWe will do our utmost to create a peaceful, bright future full of hope for Japan,\u201d Abe said, before leading the guests in three cheers of \u201cBanzai\u201d (Long live the emperor).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest State Counsellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi attended the royal ceremony.

He made similar visits to two other shrines.\n\nLater, he took his place on the 6.5-metre-high (21-foot) Takamikura throne alongside Masako, a Harvard-educated non-royal whom he married in 1993, in a 30-minute ceremony at Matsu-no-Ma (Hall of Pine), the imperial palace\u2019s most prestigious space.\n\nAmong the dignitaries attending the ceremony were Prince Charles, the US transportation secretary Elaine Chao, China\u2019s vice president, Wang Qishan, the South Korean prime minister, Lee Nak-yon, and Myanmar\u2019s Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince Charles and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark attend the Sokuirei-Seiden-no-gi ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.

The decision was not publicly debated.\n\nThe pre-war custom of clemency by the emperor, who was revered as a god in those days, has triggered criticism as being undemocratic and politically motivated. At the time of former Akihito\u2019s enthronement, 2.5 million people were given amnesty.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Japan\u2019s Crown Princess Kiko and other members of the royal family arrive at the ceremony.

The monarch, who spent two years at Oxford University and wrote his master\u2019s thesis on ancient maritime transport on the River Thames, has indicated that he will continue Akihito\u2019s work in bringing the imperial family closer to ordinary people.\n\nIt has also focused attention on a looming succession crisis. Japan\u2019s imperial household law forbids females from ascending the throne, and Abe\u2019s conservative government has shown little interest in revising it to increase the pool of potential successors.\n\nCurrently only two members of the imperial family are eligible to become emperor \u2013 Naruhito\u2019s younger brother, Crown Prince Akishino, and his 13-year-old son, Prince Hisahito.
