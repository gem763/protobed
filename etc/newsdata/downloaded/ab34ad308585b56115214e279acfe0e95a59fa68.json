REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) beat analysts\u2019 estimates for third-quarter profit on Wednesday, benefiting from growth in its high-margin cloud-computing business.\n\nRevenue from the company\u2019s cloud services, which are driving IBM\u2019s pivot away from established businesses including mainframe servers, rose 11% to $5 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.\n\nTotal revenue fell 3.9% to $18.03 billion, missing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $18.22 billion. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue dropped 0.6%.\n\nThe Armonk, New York-based technology services giant, which wrapped up the mega cloud merger with Linux maker Red Hat Inc earlier this year, has faced years of revenue declines in the process of shifting focus to the cloud from traditional business.\n\nGinni Rometty, IBM chief executive for more than seven years, has been able to steer the company towards fast-growing cloud-computing business and lower its dependence on its traditional hardware products, but not without a bumpy journey. The newer areas of focus have sometimes underwhelmed investors.\n\nWith the Red Hat deal, the company\u2019s biggest so far, IBM is looking to expand its subscription-based software offerings to counter falling software sales.\n\nIBM\u2019s global technology services segment, the company\u2019s biggest, reported $6.70 billion in revenue, down 5.6% from a year earlier.\n\nNet income fell to $1.67 billion, or $1.87 per share, from $2.69 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the company earned $2.68 per share, 1 cent above analysts\u2019 expectation.", "description": "International Business Machines Corp beat analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit on Wednesday, benefiting from growth in its high-margin cloud-computing business.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441601048&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1VF-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
