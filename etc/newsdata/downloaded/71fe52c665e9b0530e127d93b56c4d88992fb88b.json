The executive board and the other players attending the meeting did not make any decisions about the CBA, and NHLPA representatives will be back in talks with the league in the coming days.\n\nPlayers have until Sept. 15 to decide whether to reopen the CBA and set the clock ticking toward a potential work stoppage a year from now. Even after owners decided last week not to trigger their opt-out clause, there\u2019s still no concrete indication which way players are leaning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some time to go,\u201d Fehr said Wednesday. \u201cNothing happens on Sept. 16 if there\u2019s a reopening that\u2019s made or something like that. And you\u2019ve got to hope that the discussions will proceed on the basis that both sides want a deal and however difficult it is, you\u2019re going to try and find a way to make one.\u201d\n\nFehr described discussions with the league as cordial and pleasant.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean there haven\u2019t been disagreements and significant disagreements, but it\u2019s so far at least free from rancor,\u201d Fehr said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big improvement.\u201d\n\nThe last time owners and players engaged in CBA talks, the start of the 2012-13 season was postponed and shortened from 82 to 48 games before a new deal was reached.\n\nThis time around, players appear to have bigger concerns with the current agreement than owners, notably escrow payments and other financial issues. The continued dialogue between the sides is one significant positive along with the 12 months of leeway.\n\n\u201cThere will be a series of talks and we\u2019ll see where that takes us,\u201d Fehr said. \u201cI can\u2019t predict what the results will be. I supposed what I could say is if I thought it was a complete waste of time, I\u2019d find something else to do.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NHL players have yet to decide whether to terminate the current collective bargaining agreement with less than two weeks before the deadline to do so.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/labor_players_hockey_48278_c0-100-2400-1499_s1770x1032.jpg?c570a5b2757182622f78ee702b43ab425751dd7b"}
