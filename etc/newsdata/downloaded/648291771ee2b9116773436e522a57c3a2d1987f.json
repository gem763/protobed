His term was tied to that of the parliamentary leader.\n\nMaimane was last seen at Parliament last Thursday and he didn't attend the caucus meeting this Thursday.\n\n'Growing anger'\n\nDA caucus chairperson and acting parliamentary leader Annelie Lotriet told News24 after the meeting that the caucus would elect a new parliamentary leader. It is the new parliamentary leader's prerogative to appoint a chief whip.\n\nThe DA's parliamentary leader must be elected from the caucus unless it is the federal leader, who can automatically become the parliamentary leader.\n\nThe DA's constitution gives its leader the right to lead any caucus of which he or she is a member.\n\nAccording to the MP who spoke to News24, there was \"growing anger\" for some MPs about Maimane's statements at the press briefing where Herman Mashaba announced his resignation as Johannesburg mayor on Monday, and about some of his comments when he announced his own resignation.\n\nApparently, there was no talk about further resignations at the caucus meeting.\n\n\"People are looking forward to some stability,\" the MP said.", "description": "John Steenhuisen has vacated the chair reserved for the chief whip, taking a seat among backbenchers when the DA caucus met.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8172/18fcf89b4b8b4f7ebeb9d424eadc0033.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
