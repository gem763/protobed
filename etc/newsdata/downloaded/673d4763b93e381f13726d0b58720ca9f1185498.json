The government was not available for immediate comment.\n\nSirius says it has offtake contracts with customers in the United States, Europe, Brazil, India and Africa.\n\nApart from uncertainty over Britain's relations with Europe, investor appetite for risk has been hit by uncertainty over the global economy and trade tensions between the United States and China.\n\nSirius Minerals on Tuesday reported an operating loss of 14.3 million pounds for the six months ended June 30 versus a loss of 10.8 million pounds a year earlier.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - [LONDON] Sirius Minerals scrapped a plan to raise US$500 million through a bond sale, sending its shares more than 50 per cent lower and delaying a project to mine for fertiliser under a national park in northern England. .
