But it won\u2019t be easy watching him go away, and I will worry until I see him again.\u2019\n\nScott is sometimes based in South England (Picture: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images)\n\nThe 43-year-old is saying goodbye to her Coronation Street role as Michelle Connor at the same time as waving goodbye to her boyfriend.\n\nAfter 13 years on the long-running soap, she has decided to spend more time with her boyfriend as he\u2019s often on his base in the south of England.\n\nKym \u2013 who joined the cast in the West End production of Elf: A Christmas Spectacular \u2013 met Scott last year after her co-star Antony Cotton set them up.\n\nOn leaving Corrie, the mum-of-four said: \u2018A bonus of leaving Coronation Street might be that I get to spend more time enjoying the other things in my life \u2014 the filming schedules can be very fast paced and you spend a lot of time there \u2014 but I\u2019m not planning on slowing down, there are loads of new things that I want to do.\n\n\u2018Life can be a bit manic. When you factor in having a grandchild and an eight-year-old daughter I am like the old woman who lived in the shoe. It\u2019s a bit like living in Mothercare at the moment.\n\n\u2018Scott lives on a base which is down south, but we make it work as it is for now. We\u2019re happy with the balance we have and it works.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
