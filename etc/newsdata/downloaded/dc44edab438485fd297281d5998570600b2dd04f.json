Almost all of the stories the New York Times has done are inaccurate and wrong.\u201d @greggutfeld The New York Times should close its doors and throw away the keys. The women mentioned in the Kavanaugh story said she didn\u2019t even remember the event. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nCredit goes to Trump for accurately quoting the Fox personality. There was more, however. The context was a typically active segment from the Fox News afternoon roundtable program \u201cThe Five.\u201d Co-host Greg Gutfeld and his co-panelists chewed over the New York Times\u2019 Brett M. Kavanaugh story from the weekend. As noted here, the newspaper omitted a critical detail crucial to understanding the credibility of a new sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh from his days as a Yale student. It was a towering error.\n\nGutfeld, a curmudgeon of vast brow-furrowing ability, teed off on the Times. \u201cHow many stories did they get away with because nobody was paying attention? I would say almost all of the stories the New York Times has done are inaccurate and wrong. That\u2019s how I see it \u2014 they\u2019re all wrong. . . . They get it all wrong,\u201d said Gutfeld, referring to his own experience being covered by the Times.\n\nBolding inserted to highlight a fact of contemporary America: The Times never gets away with something because nobody is paying attention. It is the most scrutinized publication in the United States, as Monday\u2019s events amply demonstrated. Fox News is organized, in fact, to annotate and amplify every last misstep of the Times.\n\nIf Gutfeld is serious about his assessment of the Times, though, surely he and his co-hosts on \u201cThe Five\u201d should henceforth refrain from relying on Times reporting as they jabber about the day\u2019s news. If the Times is really as bankrupt as Gutfeld suggests, then why did . . .\n\nThe list of examples goes on. Gutfeld\u2019s outburst is just another example of the Fox News Mainstream Media Citation Hypocrisy Syndrome, in which the network\u2019s stars appreciate the credibility of news outlets like the New York Times when it suits their arguments, only to snipe at their credibility when it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe Erik Wemple Blog addressed this very disconnect in a post earlier this month on host Tucker Carlson\u2019s sneering attempt to both credit and discredit The Post in the same breath. We\u2019ve decided that the relationship between Fox News and mainstream outlets \u2014 depend on them for material while seeking to destroy them \u2014 is worthy of sustained interest and exploration. Therefore, we\u2019re calling this a series \u2014 a retroactive series starting with the Carlson-Post piece. Much more to come.\n\nRead more:\n\nErik Wemple: The New York Times\u2019s rocky Kavanaugh weekend\n\nErik Wemple: Why Fox News\u2019s \u2018straight news\u2019 is a crock", "description": "Ridiculous comment about the New York Times is amplified by a Trump tweet.", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UQUZ5OGZJUI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
