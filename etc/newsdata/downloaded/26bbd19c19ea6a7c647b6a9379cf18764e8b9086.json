ZHAO HUANXIN/CHINA DAILY\n\nGeorgieva exuded conviction and humor as she delivered her inaugural speech as International Monetary fund managing director on Tuesday, sending a blunt warning that trade tensions are taking a toll on the global economy, which calls for a lasting solution.\n\nGeorgieva, who this month took the helm of the IMF from Christine Lagarde, said the world economy is now in a \"synchronized slowdown\", and global trade growth has come to a near standstill, with trade disputes and the ensuing uncertainty and Brexit continuing to hold back economic potential.\n\n\"This widespread deceleration means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade,\" Georgieva said in her speech \"Decelerating Growth Calls for Accelerating Action\".\n\nShowing a graphic of projected global GDP loss from the lengthy trade conflict between the US and China, Georgieva said the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around $700 billion by 2020, or about 0.8 percent of GDP.\n\nThe indirect effects of the trade war, including the loss of confidence and productivity and market reactions \u2014 are far greater than the direct economic impact of the tariffs, Georgieva said.\n\nThe 66-year-old Bulgarian economist turned to the packed audience and asked if there is anyone from Switzerland.\n\n\"Well, maybe it's right that there is nobody for Switzerland because in this scenario the whole economy of Switzerland disappears,\" she said, referring to the estimation that the global GDP loss would be close to the size of Switzerland's entire economy.\n\nNoting the Bulgarian Ambassador to the US Tihomir Stoytchev was among the audience, Georgieva said, \"I'm going to use a Bulgarian proverb: We are in the position that we can take a horse to water \u2014 by showing the evidence peace is better than war \u2014 but we cannot make the horse drink \u2014 that has to go into national self-interest and decision-making.\"\n\nShe said countries need to address legitimate concerns related to their trade practices and also to \"improve, not abandon\" a more modern global trading system, particularly to unlock the full potential of services and e-commerce.\n\nQuoting a quip that the IMF stands for \"It's Mostly Fiscal\", Georgieva urged countries to deploy \u2014 or get ready to deploy \u2014 fiscal firepower, including an increase in spending especially in infrastructure and R&D in developed countries, which will help boost demand and growth potential.\n\nThe new IMF chief also urged countries to act quickly to implement structural reforms, which as IMF research has found, could raise productivity and generate enormous economic gains.\n\n\"Potential job losses from automation and shifting demographics require countries to reform the structure of their economies,\" she said. \"If we do not act, many countries will be stuck in mediocre growth.\"\n\nShe borrowed a proverb from Vietnam, the home country of a young IMF colleague who \"sadly passed away\" last year to highlight the urgency of action: \"The time to jump is before your feet get wet.\"\n\nShe also called for countries to embrace international cooperation, from safely adapting to fintech, to fully implementing the financial regulatory reform agenda, to fighting money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and addressing climate change.\n\n\"We are, in the IMF, committed to assist countries to reduce carbon emissions and become more climate-resilient and we recognize that at the current average carbon price of $2 per ton, most people and most companies have very little financial incentive to make this transition,\" she said.\n\nLimiting global warming to a safe level requires a significantly higher carbon price, and taxing carbon is a laudable strategy, according to Georgieva.\n\n\"My professor of statistics loved to say about averages: 'You put your head in the refrigerator, you put your feet in the oven, your temperature is average, but you're dead,'\" Georgieva said.", "description": "Kristalina Georgieva exuded conviction and humor as she delivered her inaugural speech as International Monetary fund managing director on Tuesday, sending a blunt warning that trade tensions are taking a toll on the global economy, which calls for a lasting solution.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9df7fea310cf3e97a058ea.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
