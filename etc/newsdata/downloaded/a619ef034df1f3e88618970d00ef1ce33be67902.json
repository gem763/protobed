Worse, the gap was even bigger than it was last year, when the Americans were also fourth.\n\nThe U.S. finished more than seven points behind Russia, which won the world title for the first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The Americans were about 3\u00bd points from the podium.\n\nBut the Americans aren\u2019t ready to concede the Olympic podium, or any spot on it. Not when the Olympics are still nine months away.\n\nSam Mikulak of the United States celebrates after he competes on the high bar in the men's final of the world gymnastics championships.

Hitting routines is how we\u2019re going to be as close as we can. We\u2019re just going to wait for the mistakes to happen on the other hand. That\u2019s going to be our saving grace.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t promise we\u2019re going to get on that podium. But I can promise we\u2019re going to be a little better next year.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. men haven\u2019t won an Olympic medal since their bronze in 2008. Their last world medal, also bronze, was in 2014. They were seventh in qualifying after a dismal performance, and only Mikulak (all-around, high bar) and Yul Moldauer (all-around) made event finals.\n\nIt\u2019s not for a lack of talent. Mikulak\u2019s score of 86.931 in finals would win him a medal pretty much anywhere, and he also tied for the second-highest score on parallel bars and was third-best on both floor exercise and high bar. Moldauer was sixth on floor.\n\nBut the Americans lack consistency and, more importantly, difficulty.\n\nIn team finals, Russia had 11 routines with a start value of 6.0 or higher, while China had 10 and Japan 13. The Americans? Just six.\n\nThe start value reflects the difficulty of a routine and is combined with the execution score for the final total. Because they don\u2019t have anywhere close to Russia, China or Japan\u2019s difficulty, the Americans are in a deep hole even before the meet begins.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re doing what we can do,\u201d said U.S. coach Mark Williams, who is Moldauer\u2019s coach at Oklahoma. \u201cThe problem is, when you add difficulty, the execution goes down and so does the consistency.\u201d\n\nThe Americans are trying, though.\n\nBrett McClure, the national team coordinator, said team members increased their start values by \u201ctwo or three tenths\u201d on each event in the past year. If they can do that again ahead of Tokyo, and clean up their bobbles and wobbles \u2013 like Mikulak and Moldauer\u2019s dismounts on pommel horse and Trevor Howard\u2019s landing on still rings \u2013 the U.S. will be getting somewhere.\n\n\u201cThat combination of both will help us get to that 258 to 260 range,\u201d McClure said, referring to the point total needed to reach the podium at this worlds. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be really good, close to perfect if not (perfect). But it\u2019s not out of reach.\u201d\n\nMore depth also would help, Williams said.\n\nPart of what makes the U.S. women so strong is there is a never-ending pipeline of talent. With only about a dozen spots available on the national team and even fewer for world and Olympic teams, the competition is fierce, and gymnasts are constantly pushing each other.\n\nMore than half of the men\u2019s national team retired after the Rio Olympics, leaving a dearth of talent \u2013 and competition.\n\n\u201cThere was a big hole that we have to fill,\u201d McClure said. \u201cIt\u2019s daunting thinking about it in one year, but each year we\u2019ve started to bring more guys into the mix. \u2026 You\u2019ve just got to keep pushing forward and doing the same thing.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Mikulak and Moldauer will try and make the most of the chances they have left here.\n\n\u201cI just want to keep everything the same as today,\u201d Mikulak said. \u201cGet in the same mindset, just go out, repeat, have fun and keep that energy high.\u201d", "description": "Russia won its first men's team title at the world gymnastics championships since breakup of the Soviet Union.
