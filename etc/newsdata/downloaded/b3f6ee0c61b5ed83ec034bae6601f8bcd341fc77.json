(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Cameras encircled Washington Redskins running back Adrian Peterson. Until Sunday, when the team didn\u2019t play him in its season-opening loss to the Eagles, it seemed fair to qualify him as a \u201cstar.\u201d He led the team with 1,042 yards last season, and his teammates named him offensive MVP.\n\nBut Sunday, the Redskins followed through on a decision they hinted at earlier in the week and benched Peterson in favor of Derrius Guice, Chris Thompson and Wendell Smallwood, who was signed last week after Philadelphia released him.\n\nPeterson, after the game, said he knew about this decision for some time leading up to the game. The Redskins needed more bodies for special teams, and Smallwood provided one. The 34-year-old counseled Guice, the new starter, and seemed demure when asked about his reaction to the demotion, repeating the phrase, \u201cI can just control the things that I can control.\u201d Yet he did not hide the fact that he didn\u2019t enjoy being held out.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s not a role I want,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m 13 years in, and I\u2019ve still got it. I\u2019ve shown that, of course. I can play the game. But at the end of the day, I\u2019m not the owner. I\u2019m just a player. So when they call me up, they call me up. I\u2019ll be ready to play.\u201d\n\n[Biggest moments from Redskins' 32-27 loss to the Eagles]\n\nSeveral Redskins players are not happy about the decision to sit Peterson, multiple people with knowledge of the situation said.\n\nRight tackle Morgan Moses did not hide his displeasure.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have too many walking Hall of Famers on your football team,\u201d Moses said. \u201cI commend him, because it\u2019s obviously harder on him than me, being able to deal with just sitting on the sideline and stuff like that. But obviously, we think he\u2019s a hell of a football player.\u201d\n\nLast week, Washington Coach Jay Gruden named Guice the starting running back and said the offense would run through him. Guice, who missed last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee, was always expected to be the team\u2019s top back once he was healthy again. He and Thompson are more versatile backs and considered to be better fits for Gruden\u2019s offense than Peterson, whose running style is more vertical than horizontal. Peterson doesn\u2019t have as much experience as a pass catcher as he does as a runner.\n\n\u201cI think it will be week-to-week,\u201d Gruden said when asked how much Peterson will play this season, adding that Peterson and Guice are both early-down backs and he doesn\u2019t always need two of those. \u201cSo if we have a game where we think we can run the ball 55 times a game in an I formation, then sure, I\u2019ll get him up.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles themselves didn\u2019t expect the decision. Safety Malcolm Jenkins said he was \u201csurprised\u201d to see Peterson on the sidelines. It didn\u2019t change the game plan at all, he added.\n\n\u201cWe thought he would probably be the second back or have like a smaller role,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cBut [we] didn\u2019t expect him to be inactive.\u201d\n\nGuice said he and Peterson talked \u201call week\u201d about how to approach his first NFL game as a starter. He called the veteran \u201cvery helpful\u201d and \u201ca great leader\u201d in the meeting room and at practice. Guice didn\u2019t say it, and he\u2019s in a difficult spot because he and Peterson compete for playing time, but the young running back seemed to share the sentiments of his teammates. Peterson isn\u2019t done.\n\n\u201cHe has a lot of juice left,\u201d Moses said. \u201cHopefully this is just a one-week thing and we can move forward.\u201d", "description": "Washington made Peterson, the team's offensive MVP a season ago, inactive for Sunday's season-opening loss to the Eagles.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post.", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_kfSvU7I6umcaByXowVoPuBsFFA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CT24PPGSNAI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
