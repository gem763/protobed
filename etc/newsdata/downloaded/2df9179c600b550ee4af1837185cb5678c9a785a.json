There\u2019s a new hyper aggressive coach in the NFL. That would be Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone, who decided to risk Sunday\u2019s game on a controversial decision to go for a two-point conversion late in the game.\n\nWith just under four minutes to go, the Jaguars trailed the Houston Texans by seven points. The team had the ball at its own 32-yard line, and quarterback Gardner Minshew was tasked with leading them down the field.\n\nHe did just that. Minshew led a 14-play drive down the field with clutch completions and a key fourth-down scramble. With 30 seconds left, Minshew connected with D.J. Chark on a 4-yard touchdown pass.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHOUSTON, TX - SEPTEMBER 15: Gardner Minshew #15 of the Jacksonville Jaguars looks to pass in the fourth quarter against the Houston Texans at NRG Stadium on September 15, 2019 in Houston, Texas.

Marrone made the gutsy call to go for a two-point conversion.\n\n#DUUUVAL fue por el partido buscando la conversi\u00f3n de 2 puntos con Leonard Fournette pero la defensiva de #WeAreTexans lo para y los Texans ganan 13-12pic.twitter.com/HX5t07AZYo \u2014 Danhi Romero \u26be\ud83c\udfc8\ud83c\udfc0\u26bd (@danhiromero) September 15, 2019\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out. Marrone took the ball out of Minshew\u2019s hands, calling a run for Leonard Fournette. The Texans were able to stop Fournette before he reached the goal line, clinching the game. The Texans won the game 13-12.\n\nWhile many fans didn\u2019t argue with Marrone\u2019s decision to go for two, they questioned the play call on the game\u2019s most important play.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou score a TD and then you go for 2 with Fournette on a poor play call up the middle. Going for 2 is hard. Kick the damn PAT. We have the best kicker in the league. Give your fans a breather and a chance in OT. Keep Minshew. Fire the coaching staff ASAP. \u2014 Kevin Slayden (@KevinSlayden) September 15, 2019\n\nWith the loss, the Jaguars dropped to 0-2 on the season. While that\u2019s not the start the team wanted, at least the fans can be encouraged about Minshew\u2019s performance. He didn\u2019t win the game, but he produced when the team needed him late.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
