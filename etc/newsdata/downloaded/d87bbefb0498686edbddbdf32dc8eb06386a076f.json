FB 1.00% will give an independent board the ability to review and potentially overturn content-moderation decisions, the social-network operator said Tuesday, giving authority to outsiders to oversee some of the thorniest issues the company has faced in recent years.\n\nThe new board, which will be funded through an outside trust, will consist of 40 paid, part-time members who will \u201cseek to consider cases that have the greatest potential to guide future decisions and policies,\u201d the board\u2019s charter states.\n\nActing functionally as an appellate court, board members will adjudicate controversies arising from Facebook\u2019s in-house efforts to enforce its standards on hate speech, misinformation and other prohibited content. After hearing cases in five-person panels, the full board will make binding decisions on specific pieces of content as well as issue broader policy recommendations that the company must publicly address.\n\nInitial board members will be announced within the next few months, with review panels aiming to begin issuing decisions on content by early next year, Facebook said.\n\n\u201cAs an independent organization, we hope it gives people confidence that their views will be heard, and that Facebook doesn\u2019t have the ultimate power over their expression,\u201d Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said of the initiative, which he proposed last year. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing how the board evolves.\u201d\n\nThe question of content moderation has bedeviled Twitter Inc. and Google\u2019s YouTube as well, with social-media platforms taking heat both for their failure to staff moderation efforts adequately and for sometimes overreaching on particular decisions.\n\nThough Facebook began with a broad and permissive approach to speech, the company has had to change its content policies frequently in response to bruising criticism by news outlets, national governments and its 2.3 billion users world-wide.\n\nAmong the controversies the company has faced: whether to treat an iconic photograph of a naked Vietnamese child fleeing a napalm bombing as child pornography; whether a woman\u2019s live streaming of her boyfriend\u2019s death at the hands of police should be taken down; and whether conspiracy theorist and far-right talk show host Alex Jones should remain on the platform.\n\nIn designing the oversight board\u2019s framework, Facebook held six workshops, hosted 22 roundtable events, conducted 250 one-on-one interviews and reviewed 1,200 written comments.\n\nKate Klonick, a law professor at St. John\u2019s University in New York who Facebook allowed to sit in on portions of the oversight board\u2019s creation process, said a recurring point of tension was whether the board could set policy rather than simply ruling on whether content violated Facebook\u2019s standards.\n\n\u201cPeople said, \u2018Yes, we want the board to be able to dictate policy more directly,\u2019\u201d she said, adding that Facebook was initially reluctant to turn over that much power. \u201cWhat if the board came back and said, \u2018We want you to get rid of News Feed, News Feed is destroying democracy?\u2019\u201d she asked, referring to the stream of posts that has become the core of the Facebook platform.\n\nNonetheless, Ms. Klonick called the requirement that Facebook publicly respond to the board\u2019s policy recommendations an unprecedented step, as the company has traditionally responded to complaints from users, civil society and groups in private, if at all.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge moment of accountability and transparency they haven\u2019t had,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Facebook\u2019s announcement marks its most concrete description of its plan for independent content adjudication to date, key details remain unsettled. Facebook plans to name 11 initial board members later this year, and those people will in turn help to select additional members. Potential members could be drawn from the ranks of academia as well as judges, Facebook group moderators and former journalists. Facebook will accept nominations from the public.\n\nHow much board members will be paid and the size of the board\u2019s operating budget haven\u2019t been determined. Facebook said only that it is spending millions of dollars on the effort.\n\nIn a call with reporters Tuesday, Facebook governance and global affairs director Brent Harris said the group\u2019s membership will reflect their independence and the breadth of Facebook\u2019s geographic reach. Board members will include \u201csome who hold real criticism as to the way we\u2019ve operated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fully anticipate the board will overturn us.\u201d\n\nUntil its initial board members have had time to hire a permanent staff, Facebook may lend it employees. If the initiative succeeds, other platforms, both those owned by Facebook such as Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as competitors including Snap Inc. and Twitter, could eventually opt in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve set up so that the trust can accommodate other social media platforms if they want to join,\u201d Mr. Harris said.\n\nWrite to Jeff Horwitz at Jeff.Horwitz@wsj.com", "description": "An independent board will have the ability to review and potentially overturn content-moderation decisions, Facebook said.
