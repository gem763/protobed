I have repeatedly said as my own opinion I am not ideologically opposed to extending again a few days or a few weeks if you then certainly get a good solution that excludes a hard Brexit,\u201d Altmaier said.\n\n\u201dIf the British are to opt for one of the longer-term options, that is new elections or a new referendum, then it goes without saying that the European Union should do it, for me anyway.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister sent three letters on Saturday evening after being legally obliged to ask the EU to provide for a delay beyond 31 October.\n\nAlongside an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the Benn act, there was an explanatory letter from the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU and a personal letter from Johnson explaining why Downing Street thought a further delay would be corrosive.\n\nWhat next for Boris Johnson's Brexit deal?

So this form does not change anything.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the German radio station Deutschlandfunk, Altmaier said the onus was on Downing Street to provide clarity on the next steps as soon as possible for Brexit to be possible on 31 October.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is clarity and we need it quickly,\u201d Altmaier said. \u201cIn recent months, we have repeatedly taken into account the difficult situation in the UK. At the moment, the hardest part is that we do not know who actually speaks for this country: is it the government or is it the elected parliament? Both represent different positions. The government would like to quit on 31 October. Parliament has requested a delay. This is a very difficult topic now. We will talk about this with our European partners.\u201d", "description": "Merkel ally Peter Altmaier says \u2018it goes without saying\u2019 Brexit extension would be granted", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0acab1b9c39772fc6f64f03491a87a84b8685b8f/0_154_4990_2994/master/4990.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9d59d379104ee9e4b6f5201fe5bfc164", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
