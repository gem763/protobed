In a tweet, he said witnesses said it was a mortar attack by government forces.\n\nOne of the wounded, Gulabistan, 45, said the mosque was full when the explosion happened.\n\n\u201cMullah already started prayers and reciting verses of holy Qur\u2019an, when a huge boom happened, then all around me it got dark. The only thing I remember is females\u2019 voices and then I found myself in the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he had been told his son was among the dead while his brother and two nephews had been wounded and were in hospital.\n\nA Reuters reporter saw 67 freshly excavated graves for the victims in Jawdara village.\n\nThe US ambassador, John Bass, said in a tweet that \u201ckilling worshippers assembled together in peace is unconscionable. All Afghans have the right to live and worship together in safety.\u201d\n\nThe European Union said the attack aimed to undermine hopes for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan.\n\nTaliban and Islamic State fighters are actively operating in parts of Nangarhar, which shares a border with Pakistan in the east. The mosque attack was the latest act of violence in the country. A UN report this week said 4,313 civilians were killed and wounded in Afghanistan\u2019s war between July and September.", "description": "State blames Taliban for blasts targeting worshippers during Friday prayers", "authors": ["Reuters In Kabul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d0f08ef3104e043ae297bad07658116f8f7234/0_10_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=14e96f38fe0fc2d88c94b826fbedf19b", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
