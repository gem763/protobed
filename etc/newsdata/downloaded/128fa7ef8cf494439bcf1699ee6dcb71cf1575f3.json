It\u2019s arguably one of the best parts of The Sims, for example, and people are ravenous for rare \u201cskins\u201d (better known to the non-gamer as, ahem, \u201coutfits\u201d) in games like Overwatch and Fortnite.\n\nMillions of people play video games globally every day, and how they dress in those games matters. So why haven\u2019t we talked about fashion in games more? Games have long been used to explore different facets of life, from fantasy lands to wars, but fashion has fallen by the wayside.\n\nMy land of make believe: life after The Sims Read more\n\nMaybe fashion has been brushed off as a topic because it\u2019s seen as a more \u201cfeminine\u201d interest. It\u2019s no secret that video games have in the past been a male-dominated field. The kinds of games commonly approved and made catered to masculine stereotypes: war, battles, guns, weapons, strategy, domination, force, uh, more guns ... you catch my drift. Rich in detailed scenery and action mechanics, poor in any kind of sartorial consideration.\n\nBut games and gamers aren\u2019t immune to trends. The notion that gamers are predominantly teenage boys is as outdated as hoop skirts and driving gloves, or inexplicable underwear armour that doesn\u2019t seem to cover the actual vulnerable body parts.\n\nFashion is an information-rich element of storytelling. And games that do fashion-as-story always feel more complete\n\nAnd fashion is not just a \u201cfeminine\u201d interest. It matters in some way to everyone. A study from Quantic Foundry in 2016 found that for women and non-binary people, \u201cFantasy\u201d is one of the top two reasons they choose to play a game. For men, \u201cFantasy\u201d is the fourth-highest motivation. Fantasy is defined here as being someone or somewhere else, and arguably fashion plays a huge role in this. One of the biggest appeals of games is being able to inhabit a character you\u2019ve formed in your mind, and clothing helps tie you to your character and the world, no matter how fantastical it is. Fashion can make you feel powerful, as in the case of Halo Reach where you can customise all parts of your armour set.\n\nDressing up a character in games can also help you aspire to something personally. Sexy outfits I was afraid to wear? I wore them in games first. Did they make me feel empowered, or uncomfortable? Games give you an incentive to explore that feeling off-screen, if you choose. We can see this in merchandise \u2013 we love buying clothes that are branded with our favourite game series, because it reminds us of the power we feel in the game. Even Lightning from Final Fantasy had a Louis Vuitton collaboration at one point because she was the \u201cperfect avatar for a global, heroic woman\u201d.\n\nFashion is an information-rich element of storytelling. And games that do fashion-as-story always feel more complete. Splatoon\u2019s streetwear feels fun and exciting, while the period appropriate clothes of LA Noire transport you back in time.\n\nWe\u2019re getting better, but there are still huge gaps. I grew up playing as many dress-up games as I could (Roiworld or Dollmakers, anyone?) and now I find a lot of my time spent on mobile games like Covet Fashion and Love Nikki Dress Up Queen, but these are a very specific type of game locked behind microtransactions, where you usually have to pay to play the game fully and collect exclusive items. Where is my fashion game that has same production calibre as the next Shooty McShootface game? Many people have told me they didn\u2019t think they were interested in playing dating sims until we introduced action-combat into it in our game Boyfriend Dungeon.\n\nWe Met In May review \u2013 cute dating sim is a witty ode to early love Read more\n\nOutside of pure dress-up games, very few games have explored fashion as part of gameplay. Games like Hitman 2 are a notable exception, where the clothes you choose to wear (or, uh, steal) allow you to stealthily blend in with crowds. Even when games aren\u2019t necessarily built using fashion mechanics, places to discuss fashionable armour sets have cropped up behind them. Places like r/fashionsouls on Reddit have huge communities based on obtaining and creating the most stylish outfits for more traditionally \u201chardcore\u201d games like Dark Souls. There\u2019s even one going on for Monster Hunter.\n\nFashion is the story of who we are, both online and offline. I\u2019m ready for a fashion revolution to happen in games, so let\u2019s walk this runway together.\n\n\u2022 Victoria Tran is the Communications Director at Kitfox Games.
