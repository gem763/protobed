When she walks into a room she has a real sparkle.\n\nWhen I mentioned it to Erin, then six, and Efa, they were keen. We borrowed dresses from a friend and went along.\n\nChris and I watched and were delighted when Efa was crowned Miss Petal, and Erin was a runner up.\n\nBoth girls loved it so when we heard about another contest, we entered. It was the Mini Miss European Wales pageant.\n\nThere, the girls would be judged on their catwalk, confidence and personality.\n\nThe rules ban make-up and fake tan. This was about the contestants showing off their catwalk and personality on stage.\n\nWhen Efa came first runner-up and won a tiara and sash, we were all cheering like crazy. Next came The Face of The Globe Pageant in Llanelli in September 2015.\n\nIt had a proper catwalk and required contestants to raise money for charity beforehand. The girls cleared out their old toys and clothes and raised \u00a3700.\n\nEfa wore a pink calf-length dress and Erin wore purple. The judges had a chat with each girl behind the scenes and scored them on that, how much money they had raised, and how they looked on the catwalk.\n\nEfa won her category and Erin won the \u00adcongeniality award \u2013 voted for by the other girls. I was so proud, as was Chris. But when I posted my delight on Facebook , not everyone was happy.\n\n\u201cThis is disgusting,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re putting your daughter on stage to be judged on beauty.\u201d\n\nI was furious. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about beauty,\u201d I explained. \u201cThe girls are learning from the experience.\u201d Now I hope people step back before making a judgement.\n\nIt\u2019s not about one girl being \u00adprettier than another. I wouldn\u2019t put my girls forward for that.\n\nEfa is truly hooked. She won Mini Miss European Wales in 2016.\n\nAnd when one of her friends told her the winner of Young European Miss International won a trip to the US, she begged to enter.\n\nShe needed three different outfits and in total I spent over \u00a3400.\n\nWhen she was announced as the winner I couldn\u2019t hold back the tears. Next stop for us would be Houston, Texas.\n\nI spent two months sewing 150 daffodils onto a yellow gown. Efa had her hair done and was allowed to wear make-up and paint her nails. All in all I spent about \u00a31,000.\n\nShe was asked to describe herself in three words. With a cheeky smile, she replied: \u201cBubbly, because I like making people laugh. Charming, I\u2019m polite and well-mannered. And caring, because if I see someone upset I\u2019ll be first to cheer them up.\u201d\n\nTo our delight, she won.\n\nWhen we got home she couldn\u2019t wait to take her crown to show her friends. Efa told me she wants to win Miss World when she\u2019s 18.\n\nI know some parents might judge me for supporting this, but pageants have taught her many life lessons.\n\nPageants aren\u2019t just about looks, they\u2019re about building confidence and social skills and teaching girls to be proud of what they can achieve. If becoming Miss World is what she wants, I\u2019ll be there with her.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0 Follow Gemma and Efa\u2019s story on DRYCH: Tu \u00f4l i\u2019r Tiaras (Behind the Tiaras) on S4C, Sunday, at 9pm.", "description": "When Gemma Pritchard\u2019s daughter started to enter child beauty pageants, some people were quick to criticise.
