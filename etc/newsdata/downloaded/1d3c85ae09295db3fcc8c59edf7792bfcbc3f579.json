Crude settled down 45 cents, or 0.8%, at $57.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the global oil price benchmark, followed a similar trajectory, losing 0.3% to end at $62.38 a barrel on London\u2019s ICE Futures exchange.\n\nThe departure of Mr. Bolton, a policy hawk who has been aggressive toward major oil producers Iran and Venezuela, could mean an eventual loosening of U.S. sanctions against both those nations, analysts said. That in turn could mean more global supply of crude.\n\n\u201cBolton is a known hawk on Iran, and the market is assuming that opens the door for talks with Iran,\u201d said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at the Price Futures Group. Crude production in Venezuela and Iran\u2014both under U.S. export bans\u2014has declined by a combined 2.1 million barrels a day in the past year. That has helped buoy prices amid concerns that the world is oversupplied with oil. Prices have been shocked higher several times this year amid mounting hostilities between Iran and other nations, including the country\u2019s July seizure of oil tankers that were passing through the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway that connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and an important shipping route for oil.

In May, he directly blamed Tehran for attacks on ships around the strait. Just before noon Tuesday Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d U.S. oil prices then dropped about $1 a barrel, recovering some, but not all, of the decline later. The move reinforced the view that Mr. Trump isn\u2019t eager to engage in any military conflict with Iran and may even suggest that talks between the U.S. and Iran, following the 2018 U.S. withdrawal from an Iran nuclear deal, are more possible than earlier thought. RBC Capital Markets analyst Helima Croft said the ouster \u201ccould be a catalyst for a material de-escalation in the Iran standoff.\u201d Write to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com and Dan Molinski at Dan.Molinski@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
