Nearly 3,000 people now call this cavernous 45,000-square-foot building home, escapees from the nearby Kincade Fire that has burned 76,000 acres, destroyed 189 buildings and forced 200,000 to leave their homes.\n\nMost of these fire refugees arrive with little more than nothing, but they pack the same emotional baggage.\n\nFear. Frustration. Anger. But also gratitude, compassion and even humor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard psychologically,\u201d says Daisy Carreno, taking a break from handing out donated coffee to fire victims. \u201cIn the meantime, it makes me feel good to help people. Because I know what they\u2019re going through.\u201d\n\nCarreno\u2019s story is achingly familiar to many residents. In 2017, the Tubbs Fire tore through this town, killing 22 and wiping out entire neighborhoods like Coffey Park, where Carreno lived with her husband and kids.\n\nWhile she and her family made due in a FEMA trailer for more than a year, the 2018 Camp Fire destroyed Paradise, killing 85 people and decimating 13,000 buildings. Her daughter, who lived near Paradise in Chico, evacuated but was safe.\n\n\u201cAnd now, we have this,\u201d Carreno says with a shrug. In April, Carreno finally moved out of the FEMA trailer and into a home in Windsor, near Santa Rosa. On Saturday, she and her family were told to leave by officials.\n\n\u201cWe are living at a friend\u2019s house, about 20 of us in all,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, we joke that it could be a reality show. But we do what we can. Where can you go? It seems every place has something. Earthquakes, hurricanes, floods. So we stay, hope for the best, and try to help.\u201d\n\nRed Cross will be in California fire country for 'as long as we need to be'\n\nThe Veterans Memorial Auditorium shelter, administered by the Red Cross, feels like a cross between a first aid center and a camp out.\n\nSigns in English and in Spanish direct evacuees to showers, medical assistance and meals. In one corner of the lobby, NBC\u2019s \u201cHoda & Jenna\u201d plays on the TV for a few guests. In another, a group of women play cards. A shelter worker passes through with a man in a wheelchair, while other volunteers sign in newcomers.\n\n\u201cWe had 600 people on Sunday, but around 2,800 now,\u201d says Red Cross shelter manager Victoria Escalante-Tambert, adding that there are 16 shelters in operation through the region staffed by nearly 200 volunteers. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here as long as we need to be.\u201d\n\nOne of those Red Cross volunteers is also an evacuee.\n\nBeth Fulton lives in Sebastopol, which is on the west side of the 101 Freeway. Although firefighters are determined to make sure the Kincade Fire doesn\u2019t jump the highway \u2014 a catastrophe that could find towns burned all the way to the Pacific Ocean \u2014 her town was evacuated as a precaution.\n\nThe science of wind: 'Diablo' winds are fanning the northern California wildfires\n\nFulton is a social worker specializing in emotional trauma and felt her skills could be put to good use here.\n\n\u201cPeople are naturally resilient, but to deal with this year after year can be traumatizing,\u201d says Fulton, who knows two couples who lost their homes to fire in 2017 and one moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the other to Portland, Oregon. \u201cThis seems like it\u2019ll be a yearly thing, and some people say, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019\u201d\n\nFulton says that for many evacuees who have been through this experience before, even the smell of smoke \u2014 whose acrid, eye-stinging essence now pervades all of Santa Rosa \u2014 can trigger depression. Her advice: \u201cPractice good self-care, sleep, eat, walk and connect with friends.\u201d\n\n'The hardest part ... is just not knowing what\u2019s going on back at your house'\n\nThat\u2019s a prescription taken to heart by Priti Kurtz and her teenage daughter Keira.\n\nTheir Santa Rosa home has no power, echoing the state of millions of Californians as Pacific Gas & Electric shut down service across dozens of countries due to hot weather and dry winds. But so far, they haven\u2019t been evacuated. Instead, they grabbed three Pit Bull-mix puppies they are fostering and came to the shelter.\n\n\u201cWhen I smelled that smoke, it was PTSD, here we go again,\u201d says Priti Kurtz, who in 2017 had firefighters banging on her door at 2 a.m. urging her to leave her home. \u201cI am so glad for these puppies, because we\u2019re focused on them and not constantly reading the news.\u201d\n\nKeira Kurtz heads off to talk to Red Cross officials about sharing the dogs with evacuees. Her mother sighs. \u201cAt first, to be honest, I was so upset, because I\u2019m so tired of this,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now I\u2019ve regained my composure. This is home. It\u2019s where friends and family are. So while it\u2019s all exhausting, we\u2019ll learn to deal with it.\u201d\n\nIs this the 'new normal'? With raging fires, high winds and blackouts, California is living a disaster movie.\n\nNearby, just outside the entrance to the Veterans Memorial Building, a family of three finishes eating a makeshift breakfast sitting cross-legged on the grass with their dog resting close by.\n\nThe family \u2014 Allison Baker, her husband Gail, their teen daughter who asked not to be named and a mutt named Muffin \u2014 has been out of their Windsor home since Saturday afternoon. So far, they believe it still stands.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part often is just not knowing what\u2019s going on back at your house,\u201d says Allison Baker. \u201cThe last few years here have been tough, no question. But people are getting better at disasters. We\u2019re not looking at other places to live.\u201d\n\nAsked if she, like many Californians from Gov. Gavin Newsom on down, believe PG&E should be held responsible for the fires and their aftermath, Baker shakes her head.\n\n\u201cI think these power shutoffs are necessary, to be safe,\u201d she says.\n\n'PG&E should be turned over to ... someone who can fix it'\n\nThat\u2019s not the view of Cindy Baldwin, who is busy feeding her dogs Max and Lucy near her Nissan pick-up truck in the parking lot.\n\n\u201cI think PG&E should be turned over to the fire department, or the government, or someone who can fix it,\u201d says Baldwin, who has come to the shelter for a meal but prefers to sleep in the bed of her truck since being evacuated from Forestville, another Sonoma County town that lies west of Highway 101.\n\n\u201cThe utility needs to go back to the people, or at least people who care,\u201d says Baldwin, who adds that PG&E crews have been in her neighborhood trimming trees as part of the bankrupt company\u2019s plan to mitigate against fires, \u201cbut they never clean up what they cut, so it\u2019s just sitting there, waiting to burn.\u201d\n\nBaldwin says she\u2019s also angry because the power shutoffs have put a hold on everyone\u2019s lives, which means her job as a health care provider has been paused. Her other income comes from selling pieces of crystal in shopping mall parking lots, but most are closed.\n\n\u201cLook at this beauty,\u201d Baldwin says, lifting up a blanket in her truck's bed to reveal a two-foot long rock glinting in the sun. \u201cI sleep in my truck because I need to make sure nothing happens to it.\u201d\n\nLost in the flames:Soda Rock Winery's buildings dating back 150 years burn in California's roaring Kincade Fire\n\nFor Baldwin, this latest fiery outrage that drove her to the Veterans Memorial Building parking lot may well be the last straw. Although she loves a lot about her forested California life, fear and uncertainty are powerful smelling salts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of moving to Reno,\u201d she says. \u201cNo floods. No fires. Just a bunch of sand.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava", "description": "Chased from their homes, California wildfire evacuees take refuge at Red Cross shelters and wonder if they should stay or if they should go.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/30/USAT/a09c794d-1260-4ebd-940e-6f66e77dee94-Puppies.jpg?crop=1816,1362,x0,y0&width=1815&height=1362&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
