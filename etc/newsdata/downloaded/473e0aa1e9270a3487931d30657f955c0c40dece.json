Then we can concentrate on the quarter-finals and move forward from there.\n\n'It's knockout stages, and that has been our mindset from the start - taking it game by game. We will look forward to it, but it's Uruguay first.'\n\nThe Wales squad arrived in Kumamoto on Thursday, with head coach Warren Gatland set to make wholesale changes to face their South American opponents.\n\nNarrow victories over Fiji and Australia have the Welsh well positioned at the top of the group\n\nA number of players will be rested completely from the match-day 23 as they see out Pool D just four days after a thriller against Fiji that Wales won 29-17.\n\nThey twice trailed in the game, though, before digging deep and controlling the closing 20 minutes as their superior fitness level told.\n\nNavidi added: 'If you go low on them they can offload, and if you go high, they will try and bump you. It's a tricky one.\n\n'We did deal with them at times in the second half, but in the first half they played well. They were on fire to be fair to them.\n\n'They've got the best offloading game out there, hands down. It was their last game and they came out firing, but we move forward now and look forward to Uruguay.\n\n'Our discipline let us down at times and we didn't shut down their offloading game early on. In the second half, we did stop it, but we need to take those learnings.\n\n'The boys defended well and we got there in the end, it's just the start wasn't the best.'", "description": "Josh Navidi says there is a lot more to come from Wales as they build towards the World Cup knockout phase.
