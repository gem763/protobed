The 5-foot-6 speedster is among the smallest players in the game, and has been routinely comped to Darren Sproles. Cohen should be used to hearing opponents tease him for his height.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nAnd yet, it was still devastating to see the New Orleans Saints mock Cohen\u2019s stature during Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWith the Bears down by 26 late in the fourth quarter, Cohen caught a short pass from Mitchell Trubisky, and took a huge hit from a defender. Cohen managed to stay on his feet, but was taken down before he could reach the line of scrimmage. After the play, Cohen pounded his chest and appeared to say something to the Saints defenders.\n\nSaints safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson and cornerback Eli Apple responded by ruthlessly mocking Cohen\u2019s height. Gardner-Johnson held up his arm at about shoulder length as if he was measuring up Cohen. Apple just put his hand on Cohen\u2019s head to show the size difference.\n\nSean Payton trash talking Tarik Cohen\n\n\n\nAnd then Saints players measuring Cohen\n\n\n\nmy god pic.twitter.com/i0QxqMbsVd \u2014 Eric Edholm (@Eric_Edholm) October 20, 2019\n\nThose insults, while brutal, summed up the day for both teams. The Saints beat up on the Bears like an older sibling Sunday, winning the game 36-25. Cohen wasn\u2019t much of a factor in the contest. He finished with three rushes for 10 yards and caught nine passes for 19 yards.\n\nThe day caps off a rough 24 hours for Cohen, who noticed Saturday that even \u201cMadden 20\u201d was kicking him while he was down.\n\nStory continues\n\nMadden took my superstar ability away? Awww man I\u2019m Ass . \u2014 Tarik Cohen (@TarikCohen) October 19, 2019\n\nLike the rest of the Bears\u2019 offense, Cohen has struggled to replicate last year\u2019s numbers. After gaining 444 rushing yards last season, Cohen has run for just 44 yards over the first six games. Cohen also caught 71 balls for 725 yards last year. This year, Cohen has 29 catches for just 147 yards.\n\nCohen\u2019s size hasn\u2019t been much of a deterrent throughout his NFL career. He\u2019s got elite speed, and is one of the game\u2019s best playmakers. Those traits haven\u2019t come through this season, as Cohen has been a casualty of a poor Bears offense.\n\nCohen and the Bears will look to get those offensive woes straightened out in Week 8 against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
