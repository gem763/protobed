They are from the written case of the Prime Minister and if the Prime Minister promises the court he will comply we need take no further time.

Thus he cannot act so as to prevent the letter requesting the specified extension in the act from being sent.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill told Lord Pentland, the judge hearing the case, that Johnson had repeatedly contradicted that position, including in the Commons on Wednesday, by insisting the UK would leave on 31 October come what may.\n\nAs a result, O\u2019Neill said, the court still needed to issue legally binding orders to force Johnson to comply with the Benn act in an interdict, or injunction. If the prime minister refused to do so, O\u2019Neill could return to court to ask for Johnson to be fined or jailed, he added. Number 10 declined to comment.\n\nJohnson has insisted repeatedly that he will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 October.\n\n\u200bIn his party conference speech on Wednesday, he said: \u201cWhat leavers want\u200b, \u200bwhat remainers wan\u200bt, what the whole world wants is to be calmly and sensibly done with the subject, and to move on\u200b: \u200band that is why we are coming out of the EU on 31 October, come what may\u200b\u201d.\n\nAs he laid out his Brexit proposals to MPs on Thursday, he told them: \u201cWe will be leaving on 31 October, deal or no deal.\u201d\n\nHowever, some cabinet ministers in Manchester repeatedly hinted that Downing Street believes it can circumvent the Benn act in some way, so that Brexit would still go ahead on deadline.\n\nSteve Baker, chair of the European Research Group, appeared to suggest on Friday that he had been reassured the government still intended to leave on 31 October, come what may. \u201cAll this means is that government will obey the law,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "Government pledge appears to contradict claim Brexit will happen on 31 October regardless", "authors": ["Severin Carrell", "John Crace", "Simon Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e38d9689c69f970a675d2d2a81b69ff4d805b205/487_169_3925_2355/master/3925.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15cf3179c08e72e45c5ebb505e152665", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
