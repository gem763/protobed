More than four in five (85%) did not report it.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of far too many cases of talented musicians, particularly young or emerging artists, leaving the industry altogether due to sexism, sexual harassment or abuse,\u201d said Naomi Pohl, deputy general secretary at the Musicians\u2019 Union.\n\n\u201cSurvivors are often unable to speak out because the consequences for their career or personal life are devastating. In most cases we\u2019re aware of, the survivor ends up leaving the workplace or the industry and there are very few consequences for the perpetrator.\u201d\n\nThe survey of 725 musician\u2019s union members from across the country found that almost two-thirds (61%) felt they were more at risk because they worked on a freelance basis. Just one in five (19%) said the contracts they work under included policies or procedures to deal with incidents of sexual harassment.\n\nWorkplace culture was seen as the greatest barrier to reporting harassment (55%), followed by fear of losing work (41%), the expectation that the issue would not be handled appropriately (32%) and fear of not being believed or taken seriously (27%).\n\nOne woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she had reported sexual harassment by a high-profile individual to a major employer in the industry. \u201cI understand I was one of 10 women making reports about the same individual and yet no action was taken as far as I\u2019m aware,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are freelance musicians and the incidents occurred when we were performing on tour. I was told this was just \u2018lad culture\u2019 by the person investigating my complaint. No wonder such a high proportion of issues go unreported.\u201d\n\nPohl said the union had set up a \u201csafe space\u201d email in 2018, where members could confidentially and anonymously report sexual harassment, abuse, bullying and discrimination. \u201cSince then, we have received well over 100 reports but very few have led to any form of justice,\u201d she said. \u201cThe law frustrates survivors every step of the way and in many cases it is used to silence them.\u201d\n\nThe union called on the government to introduce a mandatory duty on workplaces to take reasonable steps to protect people from harassment and victimisation. They said a statutory code of practice should be drawn up to set out the steps employers should take to prevent and respond to sexual harassment, which could then be used when determining whether the mandatory duty has been breached.\n\n", "description": "Musicians\u2019 Union survey shows almost half its 31,000 members have faced harassment at work", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/786b3582c1a29839848d85cadbe92433f5c5b27b/0_359_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f28e6330d609d57c1fb15eff20d55606", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
