Huawei, the Shenzen-based communications powerhouse, argues in a slick new YouTube video that its critics want to create a new Berlin Wall. That\u2019s not true \u2014 Huawei and other Chinese tech companies have allegedly been stealing intellectual property for years and are finally being held accountable \u2014 but there\u2019s a real danger that the United States will talk itself into a digital cold war that lasts for decades.\n\nWe are at a crossroads: At a conference on U.S.-China relations last month at the University of California at San Diego, a Chinese participant offered a blunt prediction about the future: \u201cWe think we are heading toward a partial decoupling of our relationship.\u201d Trump administration officials argue that China has been decoupling itself \u2014 denying access to Western firms, even as the United States and its allies provided technology, training and market access.\n\nBut what comes next? Trump administration officials hope that progress toward a trade deal might happen at last, now that a meeting with a senior Chinese official has been set for October. But Myron Brilliant, who runs the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s international programs, cautions, \u201cThere\u2019s a trust deficit between Washington and Beijing that needs to be restored before there\u2019s progress.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump reiterated on Wednesday that the administration plans to deny Huawei access to U.S. technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a national security concern,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cHuawei is a big concern of our military, of our intelligence agencies, and we are not doing business with Huawei.\u201d That leaves a little wiggle room, but not much.\n\nWhite House officials tell me the Chinese are mistaken if they think the administration is seeking to cripple China technologically. Officials say their goal isn\u2019t a rerun of the anti-Soviet strategy of containment but something more flexible. One administration official says his colleagues sometimes refer to this still-unnamed strategy simply as \u201cthe noun.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s problem is that it has gutted the national security process that could devise a systematic plan for dealing with China. Instead, policy is highly personalized and shaped by Trump\u2019s erratic decision-making style. \u201cPresident Trump is our desk officer on China,\u201d says Michael Pillsbury, an informal White House adviser on Asia policy. Strange as it sounds, that\u2019s probably accurate.\n\nThis administration\u2019s sharp policy debates on China strategy are exacerbated because there\u2019s no decision-making process to resolve them. On one side are China hawks such as White House trade adviser Peter Navarro; on the other are would-be dealmakers such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. In the middle is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who seems to have an instinct for where Trump will eventually land.\n\n\u201cOn no issue is the lack of a policy process more visible or dramatic than China,\u201d says Kurt Campbell, who oversaw Asia policy during the Obama administration. He contrasts how the presidents of the world\u2019s two superpowers spent the last weeks of summer. Chinese President Xi Jinping met with top party officials at a beach resort and emerged with a new honorific, the \u201cPeople\u2019s Leader.\u201d Trump spent those weeks in very public and sometimes self-destructive Twitter barrages, at home and abroad.\n\nTrump has a simple four-word summary of his China baseline, notes one administration official: \u201cXi is my friend.\u201d Personal diplomacy has its uses, but it\u2019s no substitute for clear policy.\n\nFraming a real China strategy should be Job No. 1 for Trump (and his successor in 2021, if Trump is defeated). Pillsbury described the scope of the challenge in the title of his 2016 book, \u201cThe Hundred-Year Marathon.\u201d He told me this week: \u201cWe need to change the trajectory that we\u2019re on now. That means running faster and slowing them down.\u201d That\u2019s a good formulation, but both goals require disciplined U.S. policy \u2014 something in short supply.\n\nMaking good decisions about China (and, implicitly, about the future of global technology) requires a sound U.S. policymaking structure. The best idea I\u2019ve heard is a bipartisan bill introduced this year by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), which would create a new \u201cOffice of Critical Technologies and Security\u201d to oversee decisions about China and other key countries.\n\nTrump was right to take the China trade and technology problem more seriously than his predecessors. But the time for Twitter diplomacy and deals with \u201cmy friend\u201d Xi is over. U.S. moves on this chessboard should be guided by clear planning, not whim.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The risks of getting this wrong are enormous.", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Columnist Covering Foreign Affairs", "September At Pm", "David Ignatius Writes A Twice-A-Week Foreign Affairs Column."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JOrca8CL9iSKgxeimQut5U0beg0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WNNMA4WQCII6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
