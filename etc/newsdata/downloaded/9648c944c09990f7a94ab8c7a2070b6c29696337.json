AAPL, -0.40% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.85% is going to hurt its new-subscriber growth. The company expects that subscriber growth will decline year-over-year in the usually strong fourth quarter and for the entire year, even with a strong slate of new shows.\n\n\u201cThe launch of these new services will be noisy,\u201d Netflix executives said in their quarterly letter to shareholders. \u201cThere may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance.\u201d\n\nIn the analyst interview session, Netflix executives played down those comments. When asked about the change in tone toward the competitive landscape, Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said \u201cinevitably there will be some curiosity and some trial of those new service offerings.\u201d\n\n\u201cFundamentally, it is more of the same,\u201d Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings responded. \u201cDisney is going to be a great competitor, Apple is just beginning, but they will probably have some great shows too. But again, all of us are competing with linear TV. We are all small relative to linear TV.\u201d\n\nFor more: Here comes the Netflix competition, with lots of fresh content\n\nThat sounds more similar to Netflix\u2018s long-held rhetoric that it expects to win in the long term as viewers transition en masse from a linear model to the on-demand streaming option that Netflix pioneered. As it has for years in mentioning competitors like Amazon Prime and Hulu, Netflix insisted that bringing more viewers into the streaming world will eventually help it secure a larger presence in a completely changed media environment.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on-demand consumption of entertainment,\u201d Netflix executives wrote, while specifically mentioning Disney+, Apple TV+, AT&T Inc.\u2019s T, -0.29% HBO Max and Comcast Corp.\u2019s CMCSA, -0.15% Peacock streaming services. \u201cJust like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did well during the first decade of streaming,\u201d executives wrote in closing out the \u201cCompetition\u201d section of its quarterly letter. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to compete to earn consumers\u2019 attention and viewing.\u201d\n\nNetflix shares rose nearly 8% in after-hours trading following the results, so investors must not have been surprised that executives tacitly admitted the obvious. They were likely relieved that Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth bounced back from a shocking disappointment in the previous quarter.\n\nSee also: \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 fans are flocking to buy this item\n\nThe company\u2019s actions could speak louder than its words, though. In addition to retracting its guidance for an annual increase in new paying customers this year, Netflix said it would stop projecting U.S. subscriber additions in future results, which does not bode well for growth in its biggest market. Netflix \u2014 which saw domestic subscribers decline in the second quarter for the first time in eight years and come in lighter than their projections in Wednesday\u2019s results \u2014 will now only provide global membership forecasts, a twist on Apple\u2019s move to stop breaking out iPhone unit sales.\n\nIt is never a good sign when companies stop offering information that they have long provided, or change their tune about the competitive landscape. In this case, though, Netflix appears to just be admitting the obvious: The next few months, at the very least, look like they will be tough for the company\u2019s business in the U.S.", "description": "Netflix Inc. has been dismissive of the anticipated impact of an onslaught of streaming competitors, but as a wave of well-financed streaming services from...", "authors": ["Therese Poletti"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT467_netfli_ZG_20191016183007.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
