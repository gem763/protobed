The Hall of Fame defender also upheld a three-game suspension in 2016 against Burfict on appeal after a hit upon Antonio Brown.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict\u2019s suspension for the remainder of the NFL season for a helmet-to-helmet hit was", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/7a0a67_oakland-raiders-linebacker-vontaze-burfict-has-lost-on-his-appeal-ban-remainder-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
