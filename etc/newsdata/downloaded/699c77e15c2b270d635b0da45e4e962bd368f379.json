They are literally just a few minutes walk apart. It could make an awkward meeting.\"\n\nBridge has previously spoken about the affect that the altercation with Terry had on him - who he infamously refused to shake his hand when Manchester City played Chelsea soon after.\n\nBridge told The Sun in 2017: \u201cThe most disappointing aspect of it all is that I\u2019m probably more famous for not shaking someone\u2019s hand than I am for playing football.\n\n\u201cI get abuse walking down the street now and I let it go in one ear and out the other. It\u2019s a handshake after all, nothing more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard for me to talk about the scenario because there would be other stuff to divulge.\u201d", "description": "Wayne Bridge has not seen eye-to-eye with John Terry since the former Chelsea captain bedded his ex-girlfriend", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Getty", "Swns.Com", "Wireimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article752969.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Chelseas-captain-John-Terry-R-fails-to-get-a-hand-shake-from-Manchester-Citys-English-defender-Wayne-Bridge-L-before.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
