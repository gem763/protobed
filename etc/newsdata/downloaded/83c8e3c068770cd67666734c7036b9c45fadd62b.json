He said the recent weakness is a buying opportunity, especially after Medtronic's acquisition of Mazor Robotics. Let's check out the charts of MDT.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of MDT, below, we can see that prices have been correcting lower from late September. MDT is below the cresting 50-day moving average line, but still well above the rising 200-day moving average line. Trading volume has declined during this pullback, and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) only shows a modest decline, which suggests that longs have largely stayed with their positions.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator just fell below the zero-line, so it will not take much of a rally to reverse direction.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MDT, below, we see a mostly bullish set-up. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been strong and bullish from April, and that helps confirm the price gains. The MACD oscillator is just now crossing to the downside for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this weekly close-only Point and Figure chart of MDT, below, we can see that the software is projecting a possible, or potential, upside price objective of $161.\n\nBottom line strategy: MDT should find buying support towards $104. Traders could use this test of support as a place to go long, or risk to $100 and look for longer-term gains to the $150-$161 area.", "description": "After correction, the medical device maker could see longer-term gains to the $150-$161 area....MDT", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Medtronic Operating Toward Renewed Gains", "After Correction", "The Medical Device Maker Could See Longer-Term Gains To The", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Jim Collins", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c8a69930-ba54-11e7-bc3b-f54ef06b65f4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
