He was one of the few senior officials able to tell Pompeo when he thought the secretary was mistaken, and he was even known to yell back at him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, McKinley is testifying before House impeachment investigators Wednesday about the circumstances that led him to resign last week, a month before he had been planning to retire.\n\nAccording to friends, McKinley had grown distressed about the intrusion of political considerations in foreign policy and at the department. He watched as some veteran diplomats were berated for their perceived disloyalty to the Trump administration and as experts on Ukraine were sidelined to satisfy the president\u2019s political desires in pursuing an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nMcKinley also came to believe his effectiveness was dwindling. He had argued successfully against tariffs on Mexico, but the internal fighting helped him realize months ago his days at the State Department were numbered.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe said that if the next day they knifed him, they\u2019d happily walk over his body,\u201d one of his friends said, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. \u201cHe was useful as long as he was useful, and then he was a liability.\u201d\n\nMcKinley is the third veteran Foreign Service officer to testify before the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry. The succession of State Department witnesses has laid bare the growing level of discontent with Pompeo\u2019s stewardship of the agency.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified she was removed from her posting under pressure from Trump and characterized the State Department as \u201cattacked and hollowed out from within.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGeorge Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, told House investigators he was directed to \u201clay low\u201d on the country and defer to three political appointees.\n\nAD\n\nWilliam B. Taylor, the charges d\u2019affaires in Ukraine who called it \u201ccrazy\u201d to freeze security aid to Ukraine for political help, also has been asked to provide a deposition.\n\nOne former diplomat called the testimony by accomplished Foreign Service officers \u201cPompeo\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d\n\nNow, Pompeo and McKinley are not on speaking terms, according to a friend, and Pompeo has not even issued a statement of gratitude for McKinley\u2019s 37 years of service, a common tip of the hat for retiring senior officials.\n\nAD\n\nThe estrangement is remarkable. McKinley had accompanied Pompeo on most of his overseas trips and sat in on many meetings the secretary has had with foreign officials.\n\nMcKinley is in many ways the consummate diplomat, who chooses his words carefully and rarely speaks out of line. He frequently defended Pompeo when his actions or remarks were questioned.\n\nAD\n\nMcKinley did not comment on the reasons for his departure. In his farewell email to State Department staff, he made no reference to any disagreements.\n\n\u201cSo, we are leaving the Department to pursue other opportunities, wherever they may lead,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe decision is personal: It\u2019s time after 37 years with the Department.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOthers said McKinley was held in high regard, reflected by his being named ambassador to four countries, a record matched by few Foreign Service officers.\n\n\u201cHe is really an extraordinary officer, who served the department and the United States above and beyond any call of duty,\u201d said Tom Shannon, who was acting secretary of state between Trump\u2019s inauguration and Tillerson\u2019s confirmation and who resigned in early 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss for the secretary, for the department, and a loss for the American people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcKinley\u2019s departure also reflects an about-face in perceptions of Pompeo among employees. Many were thrilled when Pompeo arrived and set about correcting some of Tillerson\u2019s managerial mistakes.\n\nAD\n\nBut the revelations about Ukraine, and Pompeo\u2019s perceived failure to stand up for beleaguered employees, has prompted a round of questioning about a new State Department ethos Pompeo introduced six months ago. The statement extols professionalism, integrity and \u201cunstinting respect\u201d for colleagues. Pompeo unveiled it in the State Department\u2019s main lobby \u2014 it hangs above a plaque bearing the names of employees who were killed in the line of duty.\n\nLike many veteran diplomats, McKinley was upset at Pompeo\u2019s inaction after an inspector general\u2019s report in August condemned the leadership of the bureau of international organization affairs for bullying employees and retaliating against those considered insufficiently loyal to the Trump administration.\n\nAD\n\nDespite advice from senior officials that employees\u2019 concerns should be addressed, the report said Kevin Moley, the assistant secretary for the bureau, \u201cdid not take significant action.\u201d It also said both Moley and Mari Stull, a former lobbyist who was Moley\u2019s senior adviser, \u201cfrequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThough Stull left after news reports that she had compiled a list of staffers deemed disloyal, Moley remains in his job.\n\nMcKinley had considered resigning earlier, but Pompeo persuaded him to stay, according to a person familiar with their interactions. Then, in late September as McKinley was with Pompeo in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, news broke of Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\nPompeo has repeatedly said he has the backs of diplomats who work for him. But his inability to prevent Yovanovitch from being dismissed has made many diplomats skeptical.\n\nDaniel Fried, a former ambassador and assistant secretary of state for European affairs who resigned at the onset of the Trump administration, said Pompeo should have threatened to resign before allowing Yovanovitch to be removed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get credit for defending your people only when it\u2019s easy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand up for your people when it\u2019s hard. \u201d\n\nNancy McEldowney, a former director of the Foreign Service Institute that trains diplomats, described the State Department as being in \u201cfree fall.\u201d\n\nMcKinley\u2019s departure \u201cwill be a very heavy blow to an institution that has been under attack throughout this administration and is greatly weakened as a result,\u201d she said.", "description": "Michael McKinley, who resigned as a senior adviser to the secretary of state, is the third veteran foreign service officer to testify before House committees conducting impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CqBewA6RGmZ23zpPStf4ABOiUd8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WG34JNHQGII6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
