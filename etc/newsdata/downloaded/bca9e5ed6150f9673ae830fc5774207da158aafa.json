(AP) - A proposed industrial park east of Reno could benefit efforts to protect part of a desert trail used by the Donner Party and thousands of others as they journeyed west in the 1840s, historic preservationists and a federal official say.\n\nKnown as the Fernley Swales, the deep sand trenches and grooves that are part of the California National Historic Trail were carved by wagons and oxen in the Forty Mile Desert between the Humboldt and Carson rivers just north of U.S. Interstate 80.\n\nThe mile-long (1.6 kilometer) swales on the edge of the town of Fernley were protected in 2001 by a U.S. Bureau of Land Management easement that has remained in place despite changes in ownership.\n\nBut the site is near a shooting range and often the scene of illegal dumping. Signs marking its historical significance are regularly riddled with bullet holes.\n\nEarlier this year, Mark IV Capital bought land in and around Fernley for its new Victory Logistics Center, including the parcel with the easement.\n\nJon Nowlin, a member of the California-Nevada chapter of the Oregon-California Trail Association, said approval of Mark IV\u2019s plans would require the dedication of some land to open space.\n\n\u201cThe easement satisfies some of that requirement. They may be willing to expand it a bit to commit more,\u201d he told the Fernley Leader-Courier .\n\nNowlin said the renaming of the project as \u201cVictory Logistics\u201d is recognition of the area\u2019s transportation history. The Victory Highway and original U.S. 40 were on top of the Central Pacific Railroad grade paralleling the Emigrant Trail and today\u2019s I-80.\n\n\u201cSo, there may be an opportunity to work in preservation of the Emigrant Trail and railroad grade as part of their development plan,\u201d he said.\n\nVictoria Wilkins, acting field manager for the BLM\u2019s Sierra Front Field Office, said it\u2019s rare for the agency to have a historical easement surrounded by an industrial park, but the development could benefit the swales.\n\n\u201cThe thing with the swales is, there aren\u2019t a lot of eyes on it. There\u2019s nothing to really deter the dumping. With development, there\u2019s going to be more eyes on the property,\u201d she said.\n\nRoss Pfautz, Mark IV\u2019s vice president of development and asset management, said the company was aware of the properties\u2019 protections when it bought the land and has been in talks with a local conservation group.\n\n\u201cWe certainly recognize it\u2019s part of history and has some significance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Stevens-Townsend-Murphy Party established the Truckee River Route of the Emigrant Trail in 1844. The Donner Party used the route to pass through the area in 1846. Travel spiked around 1849 as thousands of people made their way to California during the Gold Rush.\n\nThe trail crossed the last 7 miles (11 kilometers) of Nevada\u2019s Forty Mile Desert, known for its sand dunes that stalled wagons and its scarcity of drinkable water. Use of the route slowly decreased as railroad travel provided an easier way to move west.\n\nPfautz said the company is focusing on property south of Interstate 80 for its first phase, and development around the swales is several years out.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Reno Gazette-Journal, http://www.rgj.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A proposed industrial park east of Reno could benefit efforts to protect part of a desert trail used by the Donner Party and thousands of others as they journeyed west in the 1840s, historic preservationists and a federal official say.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/fernley_development_historic_trail_06014_c8-0-1992-1157_s1770x1032.jpg?68682c4e5a1be55f7622e60f83d98dda226f260e", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
