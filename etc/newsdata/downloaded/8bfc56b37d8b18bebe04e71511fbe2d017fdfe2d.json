Malcolm Brogdon had 22 in his Pacers debut.\n\nIndiana started the 6-foot-11 Turner and the 6-11 Sabonis side-by-side with a more aggressive second-half philosophy. But the Pistons quickly erased a 101-97 deficit with eight straight points midway through the fourth quarter - the last six coming on back-to-back 3s from Kennard.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPistons: Drummond, the NBA leader in double-doubles last season, moved within one game of tying Shaquille O\u2019Neal (34) for the second-most 20-20 game since 1988-89. \u2026 Drummond also had four blocks and was 8 of 10 from the free-throw line. \u2026 Derrick Rose had 18 points, and Tony Snell 10.\n\nPacers: T.J. Warren was taken straight to the locker room with 3:46 left to play after a hard spill following an offensive foul. He finished with 10 points in his Pacers debut. \u2026 \u2026. Brogdon was 10 of 11 from the free- throw line, and Jeremy Lamb scored 10 points in his first game with Indiana. \u2026 The Pacers were outrebounded 45-36.\n\nOLADIPO UPDATE\n\nTwo-time All-Star Victor Oladipo has participated in two five-on-five practices since he was cleared by team doctors late last week.\n\nSo far, coach Nate McMillan said Oladipo has had looked fine. But he\u2019s also likely weeks away from taking another big step.\n\n\u201cHe looks OK out there,\u201d McMillan said, noting Oladipo is only practicing every other day. \u201cHe wants to play a little more but he\u2019s limited for what he can do for the next month or so before he gets re-evaluated.\u201d\n\nREPLACING THE PISTON\n\nSix-time All-Star Blake Griffin missed the game with an injured left hamstring and a sore knee.\n\nAnd until he returns, the Pistons may find themselves cobbling together spare parts.\n\n\u201cWhen times get tough, that\u2019s when everyone looks to Blake,\u201d coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cYou know when you go a couple possessions without a basket, we usually look to Blake. So in those situations, who do we go to? I think that\u2019s what we have to find out.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPistons: Host Atlanta on Thursday night.\n\nPacers: At Cleveland on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Andre Drummond scored 32 points and had 23 rebounds, and Luke Kennard made three 3-pointers in the final six minutes to help the Detroit Pistons pull away for a season-opening 119-110 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/pistons_pacers_basketball_35200_c0-930-2025-2111_s1200x700.jpg?507a2874d95a034b7f31c8bfd661a55c4134b0d9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
