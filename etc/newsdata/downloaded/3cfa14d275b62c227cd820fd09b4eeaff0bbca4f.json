A day later, the bank informed the government that Begley and Collins would follow suit.\n\nIn reality, all this has done is cause a bureaucratic headache for the courts and slowed proceedings. The US government has already submitted the relevant paperwork to push through a request for BoI staff to testify on a compulsory basis.\n\nProsecutors accuse Mark Scott, a former partner with international law firm Locke Lord, of laundering $300 million on behalf of the OneCoin scam through accounts held at the Bank of Ireland. Those called on to testify worked at the bank and processed paperwork related to the allegedly fraudulent accounts handled by Scott.\n\nThe OneCoin scam was headed by Bulgarian brother-sister duo, Konstantin Ignatov and Ruja Ignatova. At glamorous events, the pair promised to be launching a cryptocurrency unlike any other. Only, it was all fake, there was no blockchain and there was no cryptocurrency.\n\nIt\u2019s thought to be one of the biggest cryptocurrency scams, ever. The total figure the duo managed to steal isn\u2019t exactly known, but estimates suggest it\u2019s at least $3 billion.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
