This broken parliament will always vote for delay, rather than a deal. Therefore, if parliament is unwilling to vote for a deal, then we will have to get to a general election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr Johnson\u2019s route to a general election remains unclear, as Labour signalled it will continue to resist going to the country until the prospect of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal is off the table, not only for October but also for January.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

triggered an early poll by giving the necessary two-thirds majority to a election motion tabled by the prime minister, Mr Johnson would still retain the power to choose the date for the ballot \u2013 potentially allowing him to delay election day until after no-deal has happened.\n\n\u201cOne of the worries about the situation is the control of the date by the executive and the prime minister,\u201d said a senior Labour source.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to avoid is any kind of shenanigans on the government side \u2013 any kind of moving of the goalposts \u2013 which would allow a no-deal crash-out. So long as that\u2019s nailed down, we will support an election.\u201d\n\nIf Labour will not back an election motion, Mr Johnson\u2019s only other options would be to encourage an opposition party such as the SNP to table a vote of no confidence or to pass a one-line bill overturning the provisions of the Fixed Terms Parliament Act.\n\nBut veteran former Tory cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke, now sitting as an independent, predicted opposition parties would pounce on the chance to amend such a bill to lower the voting age from 18 to 16.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A shorter extension of just a few weeks to allow time to ratify Mr Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 thought to be favoured by leaders including France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron \u2013 might return Number 10\u2019s focus onto completing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which passed its second reading in the Commons on Tuesday.\n\nIn talks in Mr Johnson\u2019s Commons office this morning, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour chief whip Nick Brown offered to agree a \u201creasonable\u201d timetable \u2013 understood to be in the region of 28 days \u2013 for scrutiny of legislation to ratify the PM\u2019s deal, after MPs on Tuesday rejected plans to railroad it through in just three days.\n\nBut the PM and senior aide Dominic Cummings are understood have accused Labour of wanting more delay in the hope of forcing a second EU referendum \u2013 and a Scottish independence referendum \u2013 in 2020.\n\nA Downing Street source said there was \u201cno meeting of minds\u201d, and no further talks are expected.\n\nSpeaking at PMQs, Mr Corbyn uged Mr Johnson to \u201caccept that parliament should have the necessary time to improve on this worse-than-terrible treaty\u201d.\n\nBut the PM retorted: \u201cI find it peculiar that he now wants this bill back, because he voted against it last night and he whipped his entire Labour Party against it\u201d.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said the meeting amounted to \u201cyet more clear proof that Jeremy Corbyn wants to deliver Brexit\u201d.\n\n\u201cYesterday, Boris Johnson\u2019s deal passed because 19 Labour MPs walked through the lobby to vote for a Brexit deal that would be bad for our NHS, bad for our economy and bad for our environment,\u201d said Ms Swinson.\n\n\u201cIt seems that Jeremy Corbyn has thrown Boris Johnson another lifeline this morning, as six white men met to discuss pushing through a Brexit deal which will wreck our country.\n\n\u201cJeremy Corbyn is a Brexiteer, and Remainers won\u2019t forget if a shady backroom deal between Johnson and Corbyn helps to deliver Brexit.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson is preparing to push for a pre-Christmas general election after talks with Labour ended without a breakthrough on a timetable for parliament to pass his Brexit deal.
