Let us in!\u201d about two dozen Republican lawmakers \u2014 most of whom are not on the committees conducting the inquiry and are therefore not entitled to attend their hearings \u2014 pushed past Capitol Police officers to enter the secure rooms of the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the investigation. Republicans who are on the committees have been in on the hearings from the start and have had the chance to hear from all the witnesses.\n\nAfter several contentious hours marked by shouting matches between Republican and Democratic lawmakers and an appearance by the sergeant-at-arms, the top law enforcement official in the Capitol, Wednesday\u2019s witness began testifying.
