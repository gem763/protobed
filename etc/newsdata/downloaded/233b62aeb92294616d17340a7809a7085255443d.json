The owner of the funeral home where she worked fired her first.\n\nGerald Bostock claims everything was fine in his job as a social worker in Georgia until he joined a gay softball league. Then came the pink slip.\n\nFor skydiving instructor Donald Zarda, the termination came after the routine way he joked with a woman when the two had been strapped together shoulder-to-shoulder and hip-to-hip for a tandem jump. Something along the lines of, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m gay.\u201d\n\nThe three present the Supreme Court with a blockbuster question at the start of its new term: Is it legal to fire someone for being gay or transgender?\n\n[Supreme Court to decide limits of federal law prohibiting sex discrimination]\n\nThe cases will be argued Tuesday.\n\n\n\nGerald Bostock, who says he lost his job because he is gay, stands outside his home in Atlanta last month. (Lawrence Hurley/Reuters)\n\nThis is one of the most consequential issues of the term, with more than 70 friend-of-the-court briefs dividing states, religious orders and members of Congress. More than 200 of the nation\u2019s largest employers are supporting the workers.\n\nTo some, it might seem surprising that this is an unsettled question. Cultural acceptance of the LGBTQ community is at a high. Transgender actors were spotlighted at the recent Emmy Awards, and \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d star Laverne Cox hit the red carpet accompanied by a transgender American Civil Liberties Union lawyer.\n\nThe gay rights movement has won victory after victory at the Supreme Court, capped by the landmark 2015 decision that established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.\n\nBut gay rights leaders say \u201cmarried on Sunday, fired on Monday\u201d is a possibility in more than half of the United States, where there is no specific protection for gay or transgender workers. The states that prohibit discrimination are not uniform \u2014 some protect only gender identity or transgender status, and some differentiate between public and private employment.\n\nThe issue for the court is the reach of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, besides protecting against workplace discrimination because of race, also prohibits discrimination \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d\n\nFor 50 years, courts read that to mean only that women could not be treated worse than men, and vice versa, not that discrimination on the basis of sex included LGBTQ individuals. The Trump administration says that is what the Supreme Court should find, as well.\n\n\u201cThe ordinary meaning of \u2018sex\u2019 is biologically male or female; it does not include sexual orientation,\u201d Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said in a brief to the court in the Bostock and Zarda cases, which have been combined.\n\nEmployers violate Title VII only by treating members of one sex \u201cworse than similarly situated members of the other sex. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, standing alone, does not satisfy that standard,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFrancisco makes a similar argument about gender identity in Stephens\u2019s case.\n\n[A transgender woman wrote a letter to her boss. It led to her firing \u2014 and a trip to the Supreme Court.]\n\nThat puts the Trump administration at odds with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which decided in 2015 that gay and transgender individuals were federally protected.\n\nTreating a man who is attracted to men differently than a woman who is attracted to men is discrimination, the EEOC reasoned.\n\nThe commission also looked at a 1989 Supreme Court decision that said federal law protected against discrimination based on stereotypes; the court found for a woman who had not been promoted because her employers found her too aggressive, and her manner of dress not feminine enough.\n\nDiscrimination because of sexual orientation is the same thing, the EEOC said, because it relies on stereotypes about to whom men and women should be attracted.\n\nSome courts have come around to those arguments. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled for Zarda, and said its contrary past decisions on the issue were wrong.\n\nChief Judge Robert A. Katzmann wrote that \u201csexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination.\u201d (Zarda died in 2014, and his case is being advanced by his sister and partner.)\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit came to a similar conclusion in Stephens\u2019s case. The panel found it \u201canalytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee\u2019s status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee\u2019s sex.\u201d\n\nBut in Bostock\u2019s case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit went the other way, ruling for Clayton County, a suburb south of Atlanta, that Title VII did not protect on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nBostock ran a program for about a decade that recruited volunteers to serve as advocates for abused and neglected children. \u201cWe achieved great success, statewide recognition,\u201d Bostock said in an interview.\n\n\u201cBut everything changed when I joined a gay recreational softball league,\u201d he said.\n\nHis job was recruiting volunteers, and he recruited from the league, too.\n\nOne Monday in June 2013, Bostock found himself denied access to his office. He was told he was being fired.\n\nThe county says Bostock was terminated after an audit of the program, not because he is gay. Bostock\u2019s suit was dismissed at an early stage because the lower courts ruled that Title VII did not cover sexual orientation.\n\n[Opinion: I was fired for being transgender. The Supreme Court should make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.]\n\nThere is little dispute about the facts in Stephens\u2019s case.\n\nStephens wrote an emotional letter to co-workers that said she suffered from gender dysphoria \u2014 a mismatch between the sex assigned at birth and a person\u2019s gender identity \u2014 and said that after years of therapy she had decided to transition. Before surgical procedures, doctors said she should live for a year as a woman.\n\n\u201cAt the end of my vacation on August 26, 2013, I will return to work as my true self . . . in appropriate business attire,\u201d Stephens wrote.\n\nThe funeral home\u2019s owner, Thomas Rost, said he thought about it, but decided Stephens had to go. \u201cHe was no longer going to represent himself as a man. He wanted to dress as a woman,\u201d Rost said in a deposition in the case.\n\nIn a brief to the court, Rost\u2019s lawyers elaborated: \u201cHe weighed the impact of his decision on Stephens and Stephens\u2019s wife. He also thought about his female employees and clients who would be sharing a single-sex restroom with Stephens. Finally, he considered the impact on his clients\u2019 grieving process. In the end, Tom could not agree to Stephens\u2019s plan to violate the dress code, so he offered Stephens a severance.\u201d\n\nHarris Funeral Homes is represented by the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which says Title VII was not violated. The funeral home would have fired \u201ca female employee who insisted on dressing as a man while working with grieving families. . . . Because it does not disfavor one sex compared to the other, Harris does not discriminate based on sex,\u201d the brief states.\n\nIn previous rulings on gay rights, such as striking down a federal law that recognized only marriages between a man and a woman and state statutes that outlawed homosexual conduct, the Supreme Court relied on the Constitution.\n\nThese three cases concern the text of Title VII.\n\nNo one argues that Congress in 1964 intended to protect LGBTQ individuals; homosexual conduct was illegal in the vast majority of the country. The solicitor general said that basic fact should decide the cases.\n\n\u201cIn 1964, the ordinary public meaning of \u2018sex\u2019 was biological sex,\u201d Francisco wrote. Congress is free to make clear that Title VII includes sexual orientation and transgender status, Francisco said, but it has repeatedly turned down attempts to change the law to do so.\n\nThe plaintiffs and their lawyers say that the statute\u2019s text, not what Congress intended, should hold. That is something of a switch \u2014 usually it is conservatives making such a textualist argument \u2014 and the lawyers point to an unlikely ally: the late justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nIn a 1998 ruling in a case called Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Scalia wrote for the court that male-on-male sexual harassment was covered by Title VII even though it is not mentioned in the statute or envisioned by Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed,\u201d Scalia wrote, adding that same-sex harassment need not be \u201cthe principal evil Congress was concerned with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the textualists here,\u201d said Ria Tabacco Mar, an attorney for the ACLU, which is representing the Zarda estate. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones pointing to the words of the statute.\u201d\n\n[Trump administration, intervening in major LGBT case, says job bias law does not cover sexual orientation]\n\nBut besides Scalia, the court will be without former justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who had written the majority opinion in each of the gay rights movement\u2019s victories at the court. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who did not rule on major gay rights issues as a lower-court judge, is thought to be more conservative than his former boss Kennedy.\n\nDuring a discussion of the case at Georgetown University Law Center, Supreme Court practitioner Roman Martinez said that interpreting the text of the issue has scrambled usual alignments in the lower courts, with a leading liberal judge saying the statute does not cover sexual orientation and a leading conservative judge going the other way on transgender status.\n\nIt is possible the Supreme Court would rule differently on the two issues, and some observers think a prohibition on transgender status discrimination is closer to the statute\u2019s wording, \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d\n\nNicole Saharsky, another lawyer who frequently argues before the court, thought that was more of a theoretical possibility than a real one.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s going to say that there\u2019s not a prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but there is on the basis of transgender status?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t seem like something they would do.\u201d\n\nThe cases are Bostock v.
