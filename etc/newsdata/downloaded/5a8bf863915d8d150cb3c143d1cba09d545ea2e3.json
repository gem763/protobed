It was only after the Democrats rejected the Five-Star's advances that the populist movement turned to the League for their marriage of convenience. The Five-Star, which had risen to prominence with large public rallies called F-off Days aimed at politicians perceived as corrupt, were proving to be far more like the class of people they once so boisterously flipped the middle finger at \u2014 namely politicians.\n\nGiuseppe Conte was widely mocked as a 'Mr. Nobody' when he was chosen as the compromise prime minister in the first coalition government.

(Remo Casilli/Reuters)\n\nAs this latest government crisis inches forward, the Five-Star proposal last week to form a coalition with the Democrats seems so far to be sticking, with outgoing Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte tasked with forming this second alliance.\n\nThe largely unknown law professor was widely mocked as a \"Mr. Nobody\" when he was chosen as the compromise prime minister in his first coalition government. Now, Conte is basking in praise in both the Italian and international press for his \"charisma,\" \"gravitas\" and \"steel\" after his departing Senate smackdown of Salvini following a year of silence.\n\nThis political cartoon from Il Foglio has Italians suddenly perceiving their once 'Mr. Nobody' Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte as 'more and more handsome by the day. Why, I think he even looks a bit like Justin Trudeau.'\n\nAs Italy says goodbye to a government born of protest, the country is now ushering in one that ties together the protesters with the very people they protested against.\n\nShared issues\n\nBut Cristina Fosane, a professor of political science at Rome's Luiss University, said the new pairing is less antithetical than it seems.\n\n\"The way these parties are internally managed is completely different,\" Fosane said. \"Key points in the political process of the Five-Star are driven by the Rousseau platform, the populist's online voting system. It's a party that rather than leading and giving political direction, is given political direction by the base.\"\n\nBut, Fosane said, much of that political direction is closely in line with that of the Democratic Party: the focus on combatting poverty and social exclusion, the protection of the environment, ways of combining economic growth with fiscal stability and a growing pro-EU stance on the part of the Five-Stars.\n\nAs shared issues emerge, major symbolic divisions \u2014 the fate of Europe's largest steel plant and the construction of a controversial high-speed rail between Italy and France \u2014 have, if not disappeared, at least deflated. That is mostly thanks to the Five-Star setting aside populist rhetoric in favour of economic pragmatism.\n\nEven the composition of the Five-Star, once a near evenly distributed melange of left-wing, right-wing and previous non-voters, has tilted more to the left as it's lost support. Over the past months, the party has bled the support of right-wingers.\n\nSalvini support slipping\n\nAnd after a year of Salvini, who in the role of interior minister dominated Italy's political scene, both the Five-Stars and the Democrats understand more than ever before just exactly what the alternative to their uncomfortable alliance looks like: far-right tirades and harsh 'security decrees' curbing migrants' rights softened by Facebook posts of Salvini with kittens and his favourite chocolate breakfast spread.\n\nEven the former Democratic prime minister Matteo Renzi, who last year went on Italian television to proclaim his party would never strike an accord with a movement that accused the Democrats of being \"mafiosi, corrupt, friends of bankers and oil barons\" has changed his mind.\n\nBut Italy, with its string of failed governments, frenemy pacts and ever-swelling debt, has been a political anomaly as well as a harbinger. Twenty-five years ago when Silvio Berlusconi, a cruise-ship-crooner-turned-TV-tycoon, swept to power on the soccer-chant \"Forza Italia!\" (Go Italy!) \u2014 the world laughed. Now, the world has Donald Trump.\n\nLast year, Italy became the first major European democracy to elect a far-right populist government.\n\nNow, support for Salvini is slipping. And if the Five-Stars and the Democrats are able to put their animosities aside, the country could become the first to stave off this wave before it crests.\n\nBut most observers doubt this will happen, even if the next government manages to tackle what previous governments have put off: Italy's outsized debt, high unemployment and anemic growth.\n\n\"This government needs to act quickly to pass a new budget [to cut spending and avoid new taxes],\" Fasone said. \"But even if they do, it could only feed more into the far-right, anti-austerity rhetoric.\"\n\nSalvini may now be shouting from the wings instead of centre stage, but he's also keenly watching for his next moment, which could be his biggest yet.", "description": "With the crumbling of Italy's coalition government and the scramble to form yet another, this latest crisis to grip Italy could be seen as just one more confusing chapter in a country where chaos has been the one political constant.", "authors": ["Rome Correspondent", "Rome Correspondent Megan Williams Has Covered Everything Italian Politics", "Migration To The Vatican", "The Venice Biennale For Almost Two Decades.
