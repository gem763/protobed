Let\u2019s just say that it fell a bit short of that. Officials in Lincoln County, Nevada (where the base is located) estimated the crowds at Rachel and Hiko to total somewhere \u201cin the low thousands.\u201d\n\nAt three in the morning yesterday, the \u201cNaruto Run\u201d to go \u201csee them aliens\u201d briefly looked like it might happen, but only about 75 people actually made it to the gate near Rachel. Some in the crowd expressed disappointment, but mostly they seemed to be having fun. (Associated Press)\n\nEvents involving thousands of Earthlings answering an internet buzz about an invitation to \u201cStorm Area 51\u201d in the Nevada desert have been mostly festive, with crowds numbering in the low thousands and few arrests, officials said. Three more people were arrested Friday on the remote once-secret military base, Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said, bringing to five the tally since Thursday of accused trespassers during \u201cAlienstock\u201d and \u201cArea 51 Basecamp\u201d events and festivals in the tiny desert towns of Rachel and Hiko. Several minor injuries were reported, and one man was treated for dehydration by festival medics in Rachel before returning to the party. While costumed space aliens were a common, dayglow, and sometimes hilarious sight, no one reported seeing actual extraterrestrials or UFOs.\n\nSo was it a success? Well, none of the things I feared the most came to pass, at least not to a great degree. There were only five idiots arrested for actually crossing onto base property. One person was reportedly treated for dehydration, but there seemed to be sufficient water and other supplies for the smaller than expected number of people. (Those numbers may grow a bit now that the weekend has arrived.) So long as everyone is having fun, enjoying the music and lectures, and generally respecting the residents\u2019 property rights, I suppose we can call it a win.\n\nThere were not, however, any extraterrestrial beings or craft observed. This is my shocked face.\n\nThis brief, one minute clip from the AP has a couple of quick interviews with some of the more \u201ccolorful\u201d characters who showed up to take part.\n\nThe MSM coverage doesn\u2019t really do it justice, however. I was following some live stream coverage from attendees on YouTube and they provided a lot more of the local flavor. This guy was there at three in the morning with the \u201craiders\u201d and captured some good footage of the people at the gate as well as the security personnel. There were some serious characters there, but nothing seemed to be getting out of hand. It\u2019s a well-edited clip, and they did a great job with it.\n\nOf course, not all of the \u201ccoverage\u201d coming across social media was quite so accurate, or at least it didn\u2019t seem so. For example, this report left me a bit skeptical.\n\nIn any event, as I mentioned above, nobody died and very few people wound up in custody. They\u2019ve set up some stages and musicians are providing entertainment. If that\u2019s all they want to do then maybe they should turn it into an annual event. All in all, I\u2019m calling it a win, provided it doesn\u2019t suddenly devolve into a total crap storm over the rest of the weekend.", "description": "In the eye of the beholder", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SA51.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
