Australian shares were up 0.2%.\n\nIn early European trading, the futures for pan-region were up 0.65%, German DAX 0.6%, and London's FTSE 0.52%.\n\nChinese stocks rose and the hit a three-week high after U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to delay an additional increase in tariffs on Chinese goods by two weeks at the request of China's Vice Premier Liu He \"as a gesture of good will.\" U.S. stock futures rose 0.38% and safe-havens such as the yen, U.S. Treasuries, and weakened in a sign of improving appetite for risk.\n\nBut, the as most of the sectors were showing weakness on September 12th, 2019; which finally drag down in negative territory. Finally, I conclude that the quantum of sell off looks evident enough to result in the gap-down opening on September 13th, 2019 in Nifty 50. Secondly, if the Nifty 50 closes below 10,863 on September 13th, 2019; downward move may be too steeper than ever before during the upcoming week.
