The so-called Airspace Connected Experience will allow passengers to remote order food and beverages and set preferred seat positions, for example, as well as see customised entertainment and ads, among other in-flight offerings.\n\nCollecting data about everything from what passengers prefer to eat to what they like to shop for or watch while in-flight creates huge revenue opportunities for airlines. Digitising the in-flight experience is also intended to improve efficiency, cut costs, and build a wealth of data about flight operations.\n\nMan Accused Of Hiding Spy Cam In Airline Bathroom A man has been accused of installing a surveillance camera in the first-class lavatory of a recent United Airlines flight before the device was discovered by a woman who noticed an odd-looking blinking light while in the bathroom. And it may not have been the first time. Read more\n\nStand-out features of the tracking system include monitoring everything from whether a passenger\u2019s seat belt is fastened \u2014 a task that\u2019s traditionally performed by human flight attendants \u2014 with green or red signals, according to Bloomberg, to the time a passenger spends in the lavatory. A spokesperson for Airbus told Gizmodo by email that the belt-sensor system will allow flight crew to notify an unbuckled passenger to do so or to avoid disturbing a sleeping passenger whose belt is already fastened.\n\nAs for its lavatory-tracking, Airbus is also testing camera systems outside lavatories to keep track of passenger wait times and avoid servicing hold-ups. A spokesperson told Gizmodo by email that this system \u201cwill help airlines to provide their passengers with the right amount of [lavatory] facilities/amenities that they need on board, especially by knowing the level of demand during peak times. The sensors could also alert cabin crew if somebody has been locked inside the lav for a very long time \u2014 who could be ill or need assistance.\u201d\n\nAirbus\u2019s rep said that the lavatory cameras would be tasked with tracking things like how many people were waiting in line and at what times, as well as how fast the line shuffles through. But the company did not respond to further questioning about how that blurring system would work. Instead, it pointed to an image of the platform published at Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller depicting blurred faces that seems to raise more questions than it answers.\n\nIn an April press release, Airbus said that in addition to data about passengers being made available to the flight crew, \u201cit is also planned that consolidated information could also be uploaded to the Skywise cloud for subsequent trend analytics.\u201d (Skywise is the Airbus-developed open data platform.) Additionally, in this week\u2019s release, Airbus claimed that passengers would receive customised experiences \u201cspecifically targeted to the individual needs and preferences, based on the available data\u201d and \u201ca tailor-made inflight [in-flight entertainment] offer.\u201d\n\nHowever, when reached for comment about what information might be stored, the Airbus spokesperson told Gizmodo in a response relating to seat belt sensors and lavatory tracking that for \u201call these cases however, no passenger is \u2018tracked\u2019 and their identity or personal information are not stored.\u201d Asked whether the system would track things like dietary preferences or entertainment and ads, the spokesperson responded: \u201cNo. Skywise is for equipment trend/reliability analytics. It does not track passengers.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Airbus would monetise any collected data, the spokesperson provided a somewhat perplexing response:\n\nRegarding \u201cmonetising\u201d data, the answer \u2018no\u2019. Knowing what\u2019s cooking in the oven, or sensing how many pax are queuing outside a loo isn\u2019t something that would or could be monetized. Rather that kind of data simply allows the airlines operate a more efficient service, and make sure the passengers have everything they need \u2013 from delivering the right meals, to having enough loos on the plane, especially at peak times.\n\nGreat! Maybe. But as far as the implication that in-flight data couldn\u2019t be monetized goes, that\u2019s simply not true. There\u2019s every reason to believe that passengers\u2019 activities on a flight would provide monetizable data that could be valuable to other airlines, aircraft manufacturers, credit card companies, and god knows who else.\n\nWhen asked if it could provide a copy of the terms of service that passengers would sign before flying on an aircraft outfitted with the system, AirBus explained that those documents would be handled by the individual airlines after testing is complete. So, unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to get a handle on what rights you\u2019ll be giving away before this system makes its way to a diffuse set of airlines with slightly different agreements buried among countless pages.\n\nLet\u2019s recap here: The AirBus system tracks numerous activities that passengers engage in while on a flight (and that list of activities can certainly get bigger), but according to AirBus it does not, I repeat, does not \u201ctrack passengers.\u201d If that kind of hairsplitting and lack of forthright communication makes you feel good about getting on an aircraft weighing hundreds of tonnes hurtling through the sky at hundreds of kilometers per hour, then welcome aboard. We hope you enjoy flying the friendly skies of the data future and everything works out better than it did when we thought it was no big deal to let the stupid social networks collect every bit of data possible.\n\nAirbus said it\u2019s currently testing the system aboard its A350-900 Flight Lab aircraft. Bloomberg further reported that the company \u201cplans to introduce it on the A321 family in 2021, followed by the larger, two-aisle A350 series two years later.\u201d\n\nTracking things like whether all seat belts are buckled ahead of take-off and keeping track of which lavatories need to be restocked ahead of time will no doubt give flight crew a leg up on efficiency. But, at the same time, without a clearer idea of how that data is being used, the Connected Experience raises a lot of privacy questions. Questions like: Do we really want to be handing over buckets of personal data each time we fly? Is this really necessary? Is the biometric screening seriously not enough?", "description": "Your flight could soon be keeping tabs on everything from your preferences for in-flight snacks to the length of your bathroom trips....", "authors": ["Charles Pulliam-Moore", "Catie Keck"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/mthypm9rfmgbr96hcx2w.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
