Presented by Alibaba\n\nwith help from John Bresnahan\n\nWHEN IT UKRAINES, IT POURS -- While you were sleeping, Democrats released a trove of explosive text messages between U.S. diplomats and a senior Ukrainian aide \u2014 and boy, they are a doozy. The text messages \u2014 which former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker turned over to House investigators during his deposition yesterday \u2014 outline how senior State Department officials were deeply alarmed that the Trump administration would try to make foreign aid to Ukraine (as well as a White House visit) contingent on efforts to help the president\u2019s reelection campaign. And they also demonstrate how U.S. diplomats were pushing Ukraine to probe Biden and the 2016 election on Trump's behalf.\n\nDemocrats will likely say they\u2019ve got their smoking gun, and will certainly use the text messages as more ammo for impeachment. But Republicans, who insist that Volker testified that Trump never sought a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d from Ukraine, say the texts were cherry picked and are calling on Democrats to release a full transcript of Volker\u2019s deposition . Here is a highlight of some of the texts:\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d said Bill Taylor, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kiev, in a Sept. 9 text message. But Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, strongly denied to Taylor that this was Trump\u2019s purpose. Two days later, the foreign aid was released.\n\nAnother text between Volker and Andrey Yermak, a top adviser to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, on July 25 \u2014 the day of the Trump-Zelenksy call \u2014 directly linked a Zelensky visit to Washington to whether the Ukrainians moved ahead with a probe into the 2016 election. Volker said: \"Heard from the White House. Assuming President Z convinces [T]rump he will investigate/ 'get to the bottom of what happened in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\"\n\n\"I think potus really wants the deliverable,\" Gordon texted Volker on August 9, when discussing potential meeting dates. Yermak responded with a reference to \u201cBursima\u201d, the gas company where Joe Biden\u2019s son was a board member. \"Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,\" Yermak texted back.\n\n\"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Taylor texted Sondland on September 1. Sondland's response: \"Call me,\u201d he texted.\n\nBUT, WAIT THERE\u2019S MORE ... The text messages weren\u2019t the only bombshell stories that dropped last night. Here is a roundup of some of the other important news reports that you don\u2019t want to miss:\n\n\u2014 \"Trump Ordered Ukraine Ambassador Removed After Complaints From Giuliani, Others,\" by WSJ\u2019s Rebecca Ballhaus, Mike Bender and Vivian Salama: https://on.wsj.com/30KFvL1 .\n\n\u2014 \"Trump Envoys Pushed Ukraine to Commit to Investigations,\" per Ken Vogel and Mike Schmidt of the NYT: https://nyti.ms/359jR6z .\n\n\u2014\"Trump raised Biden with Xi in June call housed in highly secure server,\" via Kylie Atwood, Kevin Liptak, Pamela Brown, Jim Sciutto and Gloria Borger: https://cnn.it/2VdNIX5 .\n\n\u2014 \u201cIRS whistleblower said to report Treasury political appointee might have tried to interfere in audit of Trump or Pence,\u201d from WaPo\u2019s Jeff Stein, Tom Hamburger and Josh Dawsey: https://wapo.st/331SjhK .\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 03: Former Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker departs following a closed-door deposition led by the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill on October 3, 2019 in Washington, DC.

The symbolic move represents the GOP\u2019s latest offensive in the intensifying impeachment battle as the party struggles to defend Trump. And without a clear strategy from the White House, the GOP has been taking their cues from the president, who has been treating House Intelligence Chairman Schiff as a punching bag in the impeachment fight.\n\nThe eagerness to demonize Schiff demonstrates Republicans\u2019 deep reluctance to opine on whether it was appropriate for Trump to ask Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political opponent. But that conversation is getting more difficult to avoid, especially after Trump on Thursday called for China to open up an investigation into the Biden family \u2014 which is at the center of Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation. And most Hill Republicans kept quiet. The dispatch: https://politi.co/2IkTYaa .\n\nMeanwhile, the latest White House strategy is to essentially dare Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to hold a floor vote on impeachment. According to Axios, the White House will send a letter to Pelosi later today arguing that the administration can ignore lawmakers' demands until she holds a full House vote to formally approve an inquiry. A senior Democratic aide shot back: \u201cGiven that the President just \u2026 urged yet another foreign government to meddle in our upcoming 2020 elections, we would think the White House would want to mount a rigorous defense of the President\u2019s clear betrayal of his oath of office.\u201d The story from Alayna Treene and Margaret Talev: http://bit.ly/2OlmzzY .\n\nRelated reads: \u201cRepublicans Call For A Kavanaugh-Like Strategy In Whistleblower Fight,\u201d via NPR\u2019s Franco Ordo\u00f1ez: https://n.pr/2odpqAo ; and \u201c'Americans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth': Sasse decries Trump's call for probe,\u201d by Joseph Morton of the Omaha World-Herald: http://bit.ly/2OkNmfY .\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY! Welcome to Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill, on this October 4, where your host didn't think Nickelback could be any more hated.\n\nTHURSDAY\u2019S MOST CLICKED: Roll Call\u2019s report on Democrats being divided over how much evidence they need to impeach Trump.\n\nA message from Alibaba: Alibaba\u2019s strategy in the U.S. is simple: enabling American businesses to tap into the massive and rising consumer demand in China and other emerging economies.

Well, the GOP sure does \u2013 and they say Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) is breaking that pledge. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the committee, is sending a letter to Cummings this morning objecting to their latest subpoena threat and warning that if they follow through, it would \u201ctrample on long-held minority rights in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost troubling, your actions are in violation of the letter and spirit of our bipartisan agreement about subpoenas,\u201d Jordan writes in the letter. \u201cYou have failed to articulate a legitimate reason why you are violating our bipartisan agreement.\u201d In recent days, Republicans have really zeroed in on process concerns, saying the entire impeachment inquiry has been unfair and violated norms. (House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) also fired off a letter to Pelosi yesterday demanding that she halt the inquiry until Democrats answer more questions about the process.) The letter from Jordan: https://politi.co/2AGlcE1.\n\nPic of the day\u2026 Per Bloomberg\u2019s Steve Dennis: \u201cSchiff condemns Trump as Mark Meadows looks on.\u201d The scene.\n\nRelated: \u201cMcConnell signaling Trump trial to be quick, if it happens,\u201d by The Hill\u2019s Alexander Bolton: http://bit.ly/358WJVJ .\n\nRECESS ON THE ROAD -- Several moderate Democrats who represent Trump-won districts have faced little impeachment backlash so far, reports The Los Angeles Times, as lawmakers head back home for the first time since the House launched a formal inquiry. The dispatch from Jennifer Haberkorn: \u201cAt three town hall meetings in Pennsylvania and New York districts that voted for Trump in 2016, backlash to the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry was rare and only from loyal Trump supporters \u2014 not the key independent and moderate voters that Democrats will need for victory in 2020 in Congress and the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn interviews with voters at the events, self-identified Democrats said they were pleased, albeit some only cautiously, that the House decided to formally launch the inquiry. And in many cases, voters were more concerned about other issues, such as healthcare, climate policy and local transit service,\u201d Haberkorn writes. \u201cModerate Democratic lawmakers in these places will have to find a way to keep the support of progressive Democrats \u2014 many of whom have long wanted an impeachment inquiry \u2014 and not lose the votes of moderates and independents, who either support Trump or are skeptical that impeachment is warranted.\u201d The story: https://lat.ms/331JBjt .\n\nBROS BEFORE JOES -- As you\u2019ll recall, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) picked up a high-profile endorsement from liberal superstar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in his primary race against Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.). But it looks like Kennedy has someone else in his corner who is familiar with primary battles: former Rep. Joe Crowley, the New York Democrat who was toppled by AOC in a primary battle last year. The Boston Globe reports that Crowley is listed as one of the hosts for an Oct. 15 fundraiser for Kennedy\u2019s Senate campaign.

So, who took the W and who took the L? Here are our picks:\n\nW: Democratic oversight efforts. After months of being successfully stonewalled by the Trump administration, Democrats are finally breaking through when it comes to Ukraine. They got key testimony from Volker, a trove of revealing text messages and a package of conspiracy theories that Rudy Giuliani sent to the administration \u2014 all of which they will undoubtedly use to build their impeachment case.\n\nL: GOP messaging. While congressional leaders are now trying to right the ship, Republicans have grown increasingly anxious this week that the White House doesn\u2019t have a clear, centralized strategy to deal with impeachment. And some Republicans have been uncomfortable with several of the attacks that Trump has launched.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSITIONS\n\nJesse Lee is returning to Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) office as senior adviser in her communications operation. Lee, who served as Pelosi's new media adviser during her first speakership, most recently worked at the Center for American Progress. The hire comes as Pelosi's communications team recalibrates to deal with the impeachment inquiry and need for increased message coordination.\n\nTODAY IN CONGRESS\n\nThe House and Senate are out.\n\nAROUND THE HILL\n\nAll is quiet\u2026 for now.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nTHURSDAY\u2019S WINNER: Bob Bissen was the first person to correctly guess that there have been eight left-handed presidents, with Obama being the most recent one.\n\nTODAY\u2019S QUESTION: From Bob: Given that there were 13 states at time, there were 26 Senators when the First Congress convened in 1789.
