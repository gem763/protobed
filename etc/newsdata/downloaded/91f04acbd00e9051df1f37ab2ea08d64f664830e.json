The (central bank) governor and I will come up with a plan for how we can work on attracting part of that amount that could maybe be between $1.5-2 billion, to cover what will become due from previous issuances,\u201d Khalil told a talk show on Lebanon\u2019s MTV television a week ago.\n\n\u201cWe have already agreed there will be a number of tools that complement each other. Within this are issuances at low interest rates, (and) a program of issuing Eurobonds that we need from now to the end of the month,\u201d he said.\n\nWith one of the world\u2019s highest debt burdens, low growth and crumbling infrastructure, Lebanon\u2019s economy is struggling and authorities are seeking to implement reforms to ward off a crisis.\n\nThree weeks ago Fitch ratings agency downgraded the sovereign to CCC on debt-servicing concerns. At the same time, S&P Global affirmed Lebanon\u2019s credit rating at B-/B with a negative outlook, saying it considered Lebanon\u2019s foreign exchange reserves sufficient to service government debt in the \u201cnear term\u201d.\n\nWith regional political tensions rising and slow progress by politicians on enacting reforms needed to secure international donor funding and put the economy on a sound footing, Eurobond yields have risen to new highs.\n\nThe yield \u2014 a proxy of the government\u2019s borrowing costs \u2014 on a 2021 maturing bond is currently 19.8%.
