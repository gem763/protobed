Customers can either get a free 3-D image of their teeth taken at a so-called Smile Shop or buy a kit online to make an impression of their teeth that they can mail to SmileDirect. The company then develops and ships the clear aligners back and the customer undergoes a five to 10-month treatment plan.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: SmileDirectClub went public: 5 things to know about the teeth-straightening startup\n\nThe company has earned more than 1,200 Better Business Bureau complaints in its five years of existence, according to Hindenburg\u2019s Anderson, and some of its practices have been deemed illegal by dental boards in Alabama and Georgia. Medical organizations, including the American Dental Association and the American Association of Orthodontists, have alleged that the company is endangering patients and is practicing medicine illegally, he wrote.\n\nThe company\u2019s approach claims it requires no meetings with dentists or orthodontists, although dentists and orthodontists maintain that thorough oral exams are needed before undergoing any orthodontic procedure.\n\nSee: Are dentists hooking patients on opioids?\n\n\u201cWe communicated with one customer who was forced to use wire cutters to remove SDC products after he struggled to breathe,\u201d said the report. \u201cReview sites are replete with other horror stories of customers who had to take emergency dentistry into their own hands.\u201d\n\nInstead of attempting to improve its practices or address complaints, SmileDirect has \u201cgone on a litigation spree,\u201d forcing dissatisfied customers to sign legal releases promising not to complain to regulators or write negative reviews online in return for refunds, it said.\n\nEmployee reviews on Glassdoor describe an aggressive sales culture that contributes to inappropriate and dangerous approvals at the Smile Shops. Employees have 30 minutes to \u201csell a new smile\u201d to each customer and are required to close deals with at least 70% of clients each month.\n\n\u201cThis is hard to do with a clear conscience once you see refinement and mid-course correction customers coming into our shops DAILY with serious malocclusion, open anterior bites, edge to edge occlusion, and even mobility due to treatment!,\u201d one review stated.\n\nThen there are issues relating to the company\u2019s initial public offering in September, including that Chief Executive and Chairman David Katzman sold the company his private plane a month before the deal, as the company acknowledged in its IPO documents.\n\n\u201cAnd this wasn\u2019t even the first time he sold the company an interest in one of his private planes,\u201d said the Hindenburg report. \u201cInsiders and affiliates cashed out almost $700 million of $1.27 billion in total net IPO proceeds.\u201d\n\nThe stock has fallen 43% since it went public on Sept. 12.\n\n\u201cAll told, we believe SmileDirectClub will wind up as a case study in why it\u2019s a bad idea to invest in a company that attempts to fit a complex, dangerous medical process onto a low-cost, high volume assembly line,\u201d said the Hindenburg report.\n\nSmileDirect declined to answer emailed questions from MarketWatch. In its statement, the company hit out at \u201corganized dentistry\u201d and its \u201canticompetitive legal actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will vigorously defend ourselves and our business model in order to continue to pursue our company\u2019s mission to increase access to affordable, safe and convenient teeth straightening solutions,\u201d said the statement.\n\nSee also: 5 money-saving tips people hate\n\nSmileDirect will report third-quarter results in November. In its IPO filing, the company disclosed sales of $432.2 million in 2019, up 190% from the year earlier. But losses grew to $74.8 million from $32.8 million the year before.\n\nShares were last up 2.9%. The Renaissance IPO ETF IPO, +0.74% was flat but is up 21% on the year, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +1.42% 17% gain and the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s DJIA, +1.42% 13% gain.\n\nRead now: The dark side of teeth-whitening strips", "description": "SmileDirectClub shares slid 4.5% Friday before recouping some of those losses after a short seller slammed the company for practices it alleged are illegal...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS694_SmileD_ZG_20191004125004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
