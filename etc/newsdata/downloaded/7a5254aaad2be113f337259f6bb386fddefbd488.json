Supplied\n\nOn Saturday night in Melbourne, a motley collection of former schoolboys toasted 35 years since their graduation. Of course, this being a reunion of Melbourne's pricey Xavier College, it was no ordinary assembly.\n\nThe rollcall at Carlton's Clyde Hotel included leading lights of the law, such Victorian Court of Appeal Judge Richard Naill, top criminal barrister Dermot Dann QC, and Daniel Crennan QC, formerly of the Victorian Bar but now ensconced as ASIC's \"chief prosecutor\". There were your high-profile journalists, included The Australian's national affairs editor Simon Benson, and the same newspaper's industrial relations reporter Ewin Hannan. And your political types, including Andrews government minister Luke Donnellan and the Institute of Public Affairs' John Roskam. Everyone, we were assured, got along very well.\n\nAlas, that year's most recognisable Old Xaverian gave it a miss. Hopefully Bill Shorten can make the 40th.", "description": "Even without Bill Shorten in the room, this was no ordinary reunion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_106/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ad8c9269115b149ff0255a01d5c81501780311a8", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
