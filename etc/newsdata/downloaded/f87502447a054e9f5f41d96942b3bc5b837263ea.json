And it\u2019s driving the election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th District, which Trump carried handily in 2016 but became a surprising 2018 swing seat amid broad suburban backlash to the president.\n\nThe president will hold a rally for Republican nominee Dan Bishop on Monday night in Fayetteville, seeking to boost GOP turnout on one end of the district and outdo Charlotte and its immediate suburbs on the opposite end, where Democrats in Mecklenburg County are in ascendance.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
