Mr. Pence told reporters that the United States was already working with Kurdish militia members, as well as Syrian defense forces to facilitate an \u201corderly withdrawal.\u201d That process, he said, had \u201cliterally already begun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an incredible outcome,\u201d Mr. Trump said in Washington. \u201cSo you have a 22-mile strip that for many many years Turkey, in all fairness, they\u2019ve had a legitimate problem with it. They had terrorists, they had a lot of people in there that they couldn\u2019t have. They\u2019ve suffered a lot of loss of lives also.\u201d", "description": "After talks in Ankara, Vice President Mike Pence said the agreement would \u2018\u2018save lives,\u2019\u2019 while Turkey said \u2018\u2018we got what we wanted.\u2019\u2019", "authors": ["Annie Karni", "Lara Jakes", "Patrick Kingsley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/autossell/Syria-refugee/Syria-refugee-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
