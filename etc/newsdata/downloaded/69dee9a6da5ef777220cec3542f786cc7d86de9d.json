He refuses to shake my hand. He says, \u201cI am not shaking your hand.\u201d I am completely shocked,\u201d said Mr Javid.\n\n\u201c[Hugh Grant] said, \u201cWhen you were Culture Secretary you didn\u2019t support my friends in Hacked Off.\u201d I think that is incredibly rude. I wonder if people like Hugh Grant think they are part of the elite and they look down on working-class people no matter what station they reach in life.\u201d\n\nMr Javid, whose Pakistani immigrant father was a bus driver, goes on in the interview in the Evening Standard to describe the elite as people with a comfortable upbringing who attended the best schools.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey glide through life, they get second chances, they can afford to screw up, they always have the easy language on the tip of their tongues.\n\n\u201cWhereas people like me and you don\u2019t get second chances, don\u2019t have that easy language on your finger-tips, haven\u2019t got that funny anecdote to get out of that difficult situation, so you question your self-confidence.\u201d\n\nMr Grant won a scholarship to the independent Latymer Upper School in London before studying at New College, Oxford University. Mr Javid attended Downend state comprehensive school near Bristol before going on to technical college, then Exeter University.", "description": "Hugh Grant is \u201cpart of the elite\u201d and \u201clooks down on working class people,\u201d says Sajid Javid, as he revealed the actor once refused to shake his hand.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Allister Heath", "David Goodhart"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/30/ss-composite-image-2019-10-30-21-26-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-31"}
