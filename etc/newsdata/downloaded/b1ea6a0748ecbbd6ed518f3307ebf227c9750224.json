But did Castro get it right?", "language": "en", "text": "To many, it was the most loaded question at Thursday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro asked Joe Biden in a heated exchange over health care. The crowd inside the debate hall reacted with a collective gasp, as if they had witnessed a scandalous twist on an afternoon talk show.\n\nThen, Castro repeated himself. Twice.\n\nAnd just like that, an uncomfortable topic that has lingered just below the surface of the primary for months erupted into clear view before millions of Americans on national television: Are there issues with Biden\u2019s mental acuity and memory? Or not?\n\nCastro\u2019s assertion that Biden, 76, contradicted what he had said earlier in the debate about his health-care plan didn\u2019t square with the former vice president\u2019s words, raising the possibility that Castro\u2019s aggressiveness could backfire.\n\nThe former vice president had just finished defending his plan to expand the Affordable Care Act with an optional public insurance program.\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates Joe Biden, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julian Castro, and Andrew Yang talk Thursday night after a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston. (David J. Phillip/AP)\n\nBiden said he was for an optional public insurance program he dubbed \u201cMedicare for Choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone who can\u2019t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have,\u201d he said. Biden later said that people who lose their jobs and associated insurance automatically can buy into the plan. \u201cYou don\u2019t have \u2014 no preexisting condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.\u201d\n\nCastro attacked.\n\n\u201cThe difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would automatically be enrolled. They wouldn\u2019t have a buy in.\u201d\n\nBiden quickly shot back: \u201cThey do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.\u201d\n\nCastro pressed on. \u201cYou just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.\u201d\n\nAfter more crosstalk, Castro delivered the line that would echo across the Democratic Party on Thursday night, asking Biden whether he was forgetting what he said two minutes earlier.\n\nBiden turned to Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who was standing to his right him onstage. The two spoke briefly. Then Castro attacked again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you\u2019re not,\u201d he said, going after one of the pillars of Biden\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be a surprise to him,\u201d Biden snapped back.\n\nCastro also said Biden\u2019s plan would leave 10 million Americans without health insurance. When Biden rolled out his health-care plan in July, he said it would cover 97 percent of Americans \u2014 leaving out about 10 million Americans. But Biden did not seem to contradict himself on the issue of an optional public insurance program.\n\nStill, Castro\u2019s comments brought attention to a subject that holds the potential to further complicate Biden\u2019s campaign. While he leads in most polls, the former vice president has faced questions about gaffes, misstatements and his age, most recently after he told a moving war story in which many details were incorrect.\n\nAlthough it was unclear whether Castro intended to broach that topic of Biden\u2019s mental fitness, it was widely seen that way. Some top Democrats swiftly registered their disapproval.\n\n\u201cI just thought this was not cool,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) told CNN. \u201cI thought that was so personal and so unnecessary.\u201d\n\nFormer Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s first White House chief of staff, said it was a bad move. \u201cIt\u2019s how he said it,\u201d said Emanuel, who said he felt it came across as \u201cmean\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nCastro said after the debate that he was \u201cfact-checking\u201d Biden, pointing out that his insurance plan did leave some Americans without coverage and brushing off the criticism that he was too harsh.\n\n\u201cThe vice president and I were having a disagreement about health-care policy,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIf you think that any of us are going to go off in October of 2020 against President Trump, and that President Trump is going to be the nicest guy he can possibly be on that debate stage, he\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nAnother one of the candidates in the debate, Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), told CNN that Castro had legitimate concerns. \u201cI think that we are at a tough point right now because there\u2019s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\u201d Booker said.\n\nWhile brief, the clash amounted to one of the most memorable collisions of the first three debates, pitting two veterans of the Obama administration separated by three decades in age against each other in an argument over who was better equipped to build on the 44th president's legacy.\n\nCastro, 44, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary under Obama, has been one of the most aggressive debaters in the field. He sparred with former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke over immigration in June, and it was clear early in Thursday\u2019s debate that he had his sights set on Biden.\n\nCastro has been polling in the low single digits. Biden is the leader in almost all public surveys. Some Democrats felt Castro had gone too far.\n\n\u201c@JulianCastro is once again on the attack. But with this \u2018your forgetting what you said two minutes ago\u2019 attack on @JoeBiden, accusing him of betraying spirit of @BarackObama on health care, Castro is throwing long with great risk,\u201d tweeted David Axelrod, a former Obama adviser.\n\nDemocratic strategist Mo Elleithee tweeted, \u201cI think a lot of Democrats are going to react badly to Castro\u2019s \u2018are you forgetting\u2019 line to Biden.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CNN, former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm called Castro\u2019s swipe at Biden a \u201clow blow\u201d and a \u201creally bad move.\u201d\n\nDavid Weigel contributed to this report.", "description": "An uncomfortable topic that has lingered just below the surface of the primary for months erupted into clear view before millions of Americans on national television.", "authors": ["Sean Sullivan", "Reporter Covering National Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vl4L1nkJv_Uzmrj3ieYQrmKkH_Q=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PAMDIXWV3II6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
