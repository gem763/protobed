The Republican president ignored the advice of his foreign policy and national security teams, and he saw no need to consult with anyone \u2013 other than Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who encouraged Trump to make the drastic and dangerous move.\n\nAs the White House struggled in recent days to come to terms with the consequences of the president\u2019s decision, a senior administration official conceded to the Washington Post on Sunday, \u201cThis is total chaos.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the scope and scale of that chaos, because we\u2019re not just talking about an inept White House, unsure what to do in response to quickly changing circumstances. We\u2019re also dealing with a national security crisis, a diplomatic crisis, and an American foreign policy that, as Rachel put it on the show last night, is \u201ccollapsing into catastrophe.\u201d\n\nOn the ground in Syria, for example, our Kurdish allies, abandoned by Trump and confronting a brutal massacre, have now allied with Russia and Syria\u2019s Assad regime, largely because they needed a reliable ally and could no longer count on the United States. The Kurds, of course, were fighting ISIS, but that\u2019s no longer the case because Trump effectively cleared the way for Turkey to launch a brutal offensive against the Kurds. ISIS, naturally, is delighted.\n\nAmerican troops, meanwhile, have reportedly been \u201cbracketed\u201d by Turkish artillery fire, which (a) puts those American troops at risk; (b) means an ostensible NATO ally is firing on our military servicemen and women; and (c) potentially leaves those Americans stuck in a highly volatile area, since Turkish forces control the nearby roads. By some accounts, an airlift may be necessary.\n\nThe New York Times reported on the speed with which calamitous conditions unfolded.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s acquiescence to Turkey\u2019s move to send troops deep inside Syrian territory has in only one week\u2019s time turned into a bloody carnage, forced the abandonment of a successful five-year-long American project to keep the peace on a volatile border, and given an unanticipated victory to four American adversaries: Russia, Iran, the Syrian government and the Islamic State. Rarely has a presidential decision resulted so immediately in what his own party leaders have described as disastrous consequences for American allies and interests\u2026. [T]his much already is clear: Mr. Trump ignored months of warnings from his advisers about what calamities likely would ensue if he followed his instincts to pull back from Syria and abandon America\u2019s longtime allies, the Kurds. He had no Plan B, other than to leave. The only surprise is how swiftly it all collapsed around the president and his depleted, inexperienced foreign policy team.\n\nThe same Times article noted that U.S. officials have been \u201cquietly reviewing plans for evacuating roughly 50 tactical nuclear weapons\u201d that we\u2019ve long stored in Turkey \u2013 which wasn\u2019t cause for concern until Turkey started firing artillery rounds at American troops.\n\nSome international crises can be blamed on multiple figures. This one rests almost entirely on Donald Trump\u2019s shoulders.\n\nBill Burns, a veteran U.S. Foreign Service officer with more than three decades of experience, wrote a piece yesterday for Foreign Affairs, explaining, \u201cFor dictators, Trump is the gift that keeps on giving.\u201d\n\nBurns added that Trump is guilty of a \u201cdangerous brand of diplomatic malpractice,\u201d utilizing \u201ca diplomacy of narcissism, bent on advancing private interests at the expense of our national interests.\u201d On the show last night, Burns went on to say that the only real beneficiaries of the chaos Trump created are Russia, Syria, Iran, and ISIS.\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy for an American president to advance the interests of Russia, Syria, Iran, and ISIS through a single decision, but Trump managed to find a way.\n\nPerhaps, some White House allies might argue, the American president\u2019s Syria decision hasn\u2019t worked out well, but this is only part of a larger foreign policy. That\u2019s true, though as Jackson Diehl explained the other day, \u201cvirtually every other foreign policy initiative the Trump administration has pursued\u201d \u2013 from Iran to North Korea, Afghanistan to Venezuela \u2013 \u201chas imploded \u2026 thanks mostly to the president\u2019s increasingly unhinged behavior.\u201d\n\nThings may yet get worse for American interests: Russia is now reportedly \u201cpatrolling territory in northern Syria vacated by the Americans,\u201d filling the vacuum created by Trump.", "description": "It isn't easy for an American president to advance the interests of Russia, Syria, Iran, and ISIS through a single decision, but Trump managed to find a way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_tur_syria_191010_1920x1080.jpg?itok=1esKhwTj", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
