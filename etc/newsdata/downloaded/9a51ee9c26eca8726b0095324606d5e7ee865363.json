She\u2019s been taken over by the radical left.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, House Republican leaders accused Ms. Pelosi of abusing her power and subverting the impeachment process.\n\n\u201cI just watched the speaker yesterday demean the office of the speakership,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, calling it \u201ca dark day for the rule of law\u201d and \u201ca dark day for national security.\u201d", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi was once the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. She is drawing on that experience as she opens an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/us/politics/25dc-pelosi1-promo/25dc-pelosi1-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
