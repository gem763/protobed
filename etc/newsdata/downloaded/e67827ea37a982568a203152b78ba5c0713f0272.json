During his three-day stay, the woman\u2019s brother-in-law allegedly criticized the family\u2019s Amazon Prime Video account because it didn\u2019t have the newly released film he wanted to see (\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d), he took issue with the local takeout Thai restaurant for sending along \u201ctoo many\u201d complimentary crackers with their order, and he wasn\u2019t thrilled with the color of the woman\u2019s blue deodorant.\n\nThe full list of his alleged complaints, as written by BanKittenHeels, is as follows:\n\nAmazon Prime Video doesn\u2019t have the new Quentin Tarantino film that has just come out at the cinema. Ergo Amazon Prime is a waste of money.\n\nThe shower screen in the guest bathroom has a stationary rather than hinged shower screen.\n\nThat someone used the loo in the middle of the night and he could hear them flush - his bedroom door was 3/4 open.\n\nWe have stair gates, so our children don\u2019t break their necks. \u201cReally inconvenient\u201d\n\nThe Thai restaurant sent us too many prawn crackers. They sent an appropriate amount for the number of people, actually.\n\nMy deodorant is blue. And what?\n\nWe don\u2019t have an endless supply of spare clothes in his size and to his taste.\n\nHis hair was still in the shower in his en suite when he went back to use it the next day.\n\nThe towels I put out for him are white.\n\nOur front gate is too squeaky.\n\nThe planes overhead are too low.\n\nWe have too many rugs.\n\nHe can hear traffic when in the garden.\n\nOur dogs won\u2019t cuddle him.\n\nOur children wear shorts.\n\nThe settings of the seats in the car we lent him weren\u2019t to his liking.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like the preset radio stations on our car radio.\n\nMy [Darling Husband] (his brother) \u201cdoesn\u2019t wear a hat\u201d??????\n\nWe don\u2019t have his very specific music taste available to him on vinyl, although we did think to search out appropriate Spotify playlists for him but \u201cthat\u2019s not quite the same authenticity.\u201d\n\nThe local swimming pool (in a large city) keeps \u201cprovincial, British hours.\"\n\nMicrowave steamers are \u201cexcessive gadgets.\" Then 30 minutes later, \u201cI suppose you could steam veg in your steamer, have you thought of that?\u201d No s---!\n\nNone of the 3 duvets we offered him were suitable.\n\nI use my inhaler too frequently.\n\nWhy do I have rosehip oil in the bathroom, it\u2019s of no use to anyone.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nCommenters were largely in awe of the man\u2019s ability to find things to complain about, with some calling him \u201cf---ing bonkers\u201d and completely without any \u201cself-awareness.\u201d\n\nOthers began suggesting ways to get rid of him, which ranged from banishing him to a hotel to straight-up murder. But even then, one commenter could foresee it backfiring.\n\n\u201cIf you did bash his head and bury him under the patio, @BanKittenHeels, the spade would be the wrong sort for relative-bashing, the hole would be the wrong shape, the sheet you wrapped him in would be too low thread count, and the patio surface would be the wrong sort of stone/brick.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nBanKittenHeels later confirmed that her husband did speak with his brother about his constant complaining, although that did little to deter him from subsequently complaining that the family didn\u2019t keep chickens, or that the streets were wet when he was finally leaving.\n\nUnfortunately, BanKittenHeels claimed her brother-in-law was due back for a second visit at the end of that week (the brothers are currently dealing with a \u201cfamily crisis\u201d), although she has a plan for when he comes back, courtesy of one of the commenters.\n\n\u201cPlease write these out as a list, and next time he moans, don't let anyone say anything (hush them) until you've written it on the list,\u201d suggested one Mumsnet user. \u201cMake it as obvious as possible while you're doing it, repeat his complaint slowly out loud as you write it. Do it every time and leave the list on the table.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBanKittenHeels and her husband, who doubled over with laughter when he read this idea, say they\u2019re willing to give it a try.\n\n\u201cI actually feel like I could do this and pull it off,\u201d she wrote.", "description": "There are annoying houseguests, and then there are really annoying houseguests.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/HouseguestIstock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
