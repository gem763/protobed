They are accusing Trump of bullying a foreign power for his own gain.\n\nNancy Pelosi, head of the House of Representatives, began the inquiry last Wednesday.\n\nShe and other Democrats want to look into a phone call between Trump and the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nWhat do Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon and Andrew Johnson have in common?\n\nDuring the call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Democrat Joe Biden \u2013 Trump\u2019s biggest rival in the 2020 presidential elections \u2013 over claims of corruption that have already been widely debunked.\n\nThe phone call was flagged in a formal complaint by a whistle-blower \u2013 thought to be a CIA agent.\n\nThere is also a White House transcript of the call, which took place on July 25. It shows that Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, who worked for a company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.\n\nProtesters calling for Trump to be impeached camped outside the White House last week. Photo: AP\n\nDemocrats say Trump wanted Ukraine to begin the investigation to try and damage Biden\u2019s reputation ahead of the elections.\n\nAccording to the transcript, Trump said: \u201cI would like for you to do us a favour\u201d.\n\nThe call came just after the Trump administration had delayed giving military funds to Ukraine.\n\nTrump said last Thursday that he had done nothing wrong. \u201cMy call was perfect,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nClimate change activist Greta Thunberg says people who mock her feel threatened\n\nHis supporters say that Democrats just don\u2019t want their top presidential candidate to be investigated.\n\nYesterday, Democrats demanded that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, who also asked Ukranian officials to investigate Biden, to hand over all records of his communication.\n\nImpeachment is a way of prosecuting people whose power goes above the law. But it is very difficult to impeach a president. It has only happened twice before in the US, and in both cases, the president ending up staying in power. It can be hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a president has acted illegally because they have a lot of people protecting them.\n\nDuring the call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Democrat Joe Biden \u2013 Trump\u2019s biggest rival in the 2020 presidential elections \u2013 over claims of corruption that have already been widely debunked.", "description": "The Democratic Party says Donald Trump abused his power after he asked Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/4be6798e-e4ff-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires182824.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
