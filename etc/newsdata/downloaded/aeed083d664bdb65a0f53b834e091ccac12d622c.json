In this week\u2019s episode of Succession, the ticking time-bomb that is Waystar Royco\u2019s cruise ship operation gets dragged under scrutiny in congressional hearings. The Roys deploy Bill, Gerri, and Tom Wambsgans as scapegoats in front of the nation, but that strategy falls apart thanks to Tom\u2019s obvious trail of emails antagonizing Cousin Greg to delete documents. (You can\u2019t make a Tomelette without breaking some Greggs, as we learn.) Then, Kendall steps in for clean-up, launching an all-out attack on the good socialist Gil Eavis, while Shiv tears up whatever shreds of morality she has left and refashions them into an argument to convince a victim not to go public about Waystar\u2019s cruise division. Meanwhile, Roman\u2019s attempt to sell the company to an Azerbaijani sovereign wealth fund is thwarted by a literal coup, while Rhea Jarrell decides to pack up her folksy Southern verbal knives and go, leaving Logan and Shiv wondering what to do ahead of a pivotal shareholder\u2019s meeting.\n\nAll together, the debacles of \u201cDC\u201d convince Logan that Waystar\u2019s shareholders might ditch the Roys. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this Kendall stuff won\u2019t play, they\u2019re a little more fucking vegetarian,\u201d he tells Shiv as they watch Kendall perform in the hearing. \u201cWe need something big. Time for a blood sacrifice.\u201d\n\nAs the episode speeds into its credits, we\u2019re left wondering: Who, exactly, will be the blood sacrifice? Because we\u2019re very nervous about whatever catastrophe might be coming in next week\u2019s finale, we\u2019ve outlined seven possibilities. Please don\u2019t let it be Gerri!\n\nTom Wambsgans\n\nThe Roy\u2019s go-to whipping boy is the most obvious sacrificial lamb, given that he\u2019s high up on the power structure as the current head of ATN and nobody likes him all that much, besides Shiv, or maybe including Shiv, it\u2019s occasionally hard to tell. Giving up Tom would introduce a ton of conflict between Logan and Shiv, but the problem is that Tom isn\u2019t really central enough to the whole Waystar-Royco operation. He\u2019s the family punching-bag, and they\u2019ve already served him up to Congress and let Gil have his fun. He\u2019s simply not a big enough meal (a Tomelette, specifically) to satisfy Waystar-Royco\u2019s critics.\n\nKendall Roy\n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. Kendall has spent the season in a near-catatonic, drunk and/or druggy, Logan-obsessed state, and put on one hell of a show at the hearing to protect his daddy. It\u2019d be a particularly dark turn to have Logan sell out his No. 1 Boy at this moment, which is exactly why Succession might do it. If the Roys all turn on Kendall and lay the blame on him, would he finally break completely? Is it too cruel to put Jeremy Strong through the pressure of acting all that out? Perhaps the character is in such a distended mental space that he\u2019d volunteer himself for the job. The reason this might not happen, however, is that as a shell of a person, Kendall is too valuable for Logan to not keep him around. If Kendall is the blood sacrifice, then Logan can\u2019t keep tormenting Kendall, and he loves doing that.\n\nShiv Roy\n\nA twist! When Logan brings up a blood sacrifice, what if he wants to sacrifice the person right in front of him? Shiv sits at the center of this season, and if she\u2019s really smart, she could potentially use Logan\u2019s betrayal to turn against the company, burn it all down, and come out looking good. But Shiv, as we\u2019ve learned, is not that smart and potentially too loyal to the Roy family name to even risk such a move. Either Logan forces her to submit to public humiliation and she suffers through it out of a sense of duty borne from trauma, or Logan\u2019s wise enough to know he can\u2019t convincingly sell her as being responsible for that much happening at the company anyway. Regardless, I\u2019m desperate to know what kind of power sweater she\u2019d pull out of her closet to play the scapegoat.\n\nRoman Roy\n\nSure, it\u2019d be easy to leak the news that Roman was trying to get shady Azerbaijani money to take Waystar private, that he was responsible for the company\u2019s disastrous rocket launch, and that he was tangentially involved in an international incident. (Not to mention whatever other skeletons are surely lurking in his closet.) But Roman is probably too chaotic of a presence to take down safely: If he comes under attack, he\u2019ll lash out, and who knows what family secrets he\u2019d leak to keep himself safe?\n\nCousin Greg(ory)\n\nAside from Tom, Greg is most responsible for the shoddy cover-up in the cruise division, so he\u2019d be a surprisingly apt choice for a scapegoat. But Greg is too far from the center of the family for anyone else to care much about him, plus he\u2019s got a few pages from that well-labeled \u201csecrets\u201d file to protect himself. If anybody tries to place the blame on Greg, he could easily bring down Tom as well. Plus, in the universe of Succession, Greg\u2019s a little idiot who can only fall upward. That\u2019s not about to change anytime soon.\n\nConnor Roy\n\nNah. Connor was wise-slash-disinterested enough to not get involved in the family business, so it\u2019d be tough to pin anything at Waystar on him. Plus, he\u2019s way too focused on running for president, eliminating all taxes, and funding the Broadway run of Sands, a new American play about sands (and also mites), to get pulled into any of this drama.\n\nGerri Killman\n\nAlways lurking in the background, but definitely not central enough to seem like a big enough sacrifice. As Logan put it back in the season premiere when he temporarily put Gerri in charge, \u201cIt won\u2019t be Gerri, but Gerri\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nOur best guess? The blood sacrifice will be Kendall. We\u2019re sorry, but even L to the OG can\u2019t save you now.", "description": "Who will be Logan\u2019s Blood Sacrifice on Succession?
