REUTERS/Altaf Hussain/Files\n\nTotal renewable-based power capacity will rise by 1.2 terawatts (TW) by 2024 from 2.5 TW last year, equivalent to the total installed current power capacity of the United States.\n\nSolar PV will account for nearly 60% of this growth and onshore wind 25%, the IEA\u2019s annual report on global renewables showed.\n\nThe share of renewables in power generation is expected to rise to 30% in 2024 from 26% today.\n\nFalling technology costs and more effective government policies have helped to drive the higher forecasts for renewable capacity deployment since last year\u2019s report, the IEA said.\n\n\u201cRenewables are already the world\u2019s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,\u201d said Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cAs costs continue to fall, we have a growing incentive to ramp up the deployment of solar PV,\u201d he added.\n\nThe cost of generating electricity from distributed solar PV (PV systems on homes, commercial buildings and industry) is already below retail electricity prices in most countries.\n\nSolar PV generation costs are expected to decline a further 15% to 35% by 2024, making the technology more attractive for adoption, the IEA said.\n\nHowever, policy and tariff reforms are needed to ensure solar PV growth is sustainable and avoid disruption to electricity markets and higher energy costs, the report said.", "description": "London, Reuters - Global renewable energy capacity is set to rise by 50% in five years' time, driven by solar photovoltaic (PV) installations on homes, buildings and industry, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).", "authors": ["Nina Chestney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443214787&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K071", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
