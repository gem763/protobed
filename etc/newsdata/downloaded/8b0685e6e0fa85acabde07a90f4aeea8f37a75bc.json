Including the 300 ordered on Tuesday, it has ordered a total of 730 of the medium-range models.\n\nIndia\u2019s market for aircraft is growing fast.\n\nThe number of passengers there has multiplied by six over the past decade as middle class travellers take advantage of better connections and cheaper flights.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to see our aircraft allowing IndiGo to take full advantage of the predicted growth in Indian air travel,\u201d Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury was quoted by a statement as saying.\n\nAn Airbus estimate of the need for new planes in India over the next 20 years foresees domestic traffic that is 4.8 times greater than at present.\n\nThe latest IndiGo order includes a mix of the A320neo, the larger-capacity A321neo and the A321XLR, with a range of 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 kilometres, 5,400 miles) that is to be unveiled in June.\n\n\u201cIndiGo has brilliantly demonstrated the relevance of the A320neo for leading low-cost operators, and the A321neo \u2014 and now the A321XLR \u2014 provide our operators with the logical next step in cost efficiency, passenger comfort and market coverage,\u201d said Airbus\u2019 chief commercial officer, Christian Scherer.\n\nAt the end of September, Airbus had recorded more than 6,650 firm orders from nearly 110 clients for planes from the A320neo line, while Boeing had booked 4,930 orders for the 737 MAX.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Indian airline IndiGo has placed an order for 300 A320neo family aircraft, Airbus said Tuesday, in one of its largest-ever orders from", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/752d12_300-fuel-efficient-planes-on-order-indigo-reduce-fuel-costs-in-future-india-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
