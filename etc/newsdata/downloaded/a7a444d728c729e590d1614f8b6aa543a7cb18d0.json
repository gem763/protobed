Further signals that a withdrawal deal is at hand could continue to boost the pound.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nGBP/USD punched above several resistance lines on Thursday, and the upward movement has continued on Friday. The pair has moved some distance away from 1.2420, which had held in resistance since late September, prior to Thursday. The main trend remains up, with the next resistance line at 1.2585. This line is under pressure and could be tested in the Friday session.\n\nGBP/USD 4-Hour Chart More\n\nUSD/CAD\n\nUSD/CAD is trading sideways on Friday.
