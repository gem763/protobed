But on Monday morning that rally suddenly looks like ancient history after the attacks on oil-production facilities in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.\n\nThe attacks represent a \u201chistorically large disruption on critical oil infrastructure,\u201d advises Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, via a research note.\n\nTaimur Baig, chief economist at DBS Bank Ltd, says:\n\n\u201cThis weekend\u2019s drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities mark a major setback to the global geopolitical landscape.\u201d \u201cOther than helping some oil exporting companies, the overall impact of heightened risk is negative for global equities in the near-term.\u201d\n\nAs for last week\u2019s trading, shares in emerging markets topped the winner\u2019s list for the major asset classes. Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (NYSE: ) rose 2.2% for the week through Sep. 13. The gain marks the third straight weekly advance. Foreign stocks in developed markets were a close second in last week\u2019s horse race: Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets (NYSE: ) gained 2.1%.\n\nThe biggest loss last week for the major asset classes: real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the US. After a strong rally in recent history, investors took profits and Vanguard Real Estate (NYSE: ) fell 1.9%, the fund\u2019s first weekly decline in three weeks.\n\nETF Performance\n\nAn ETF-based version of the Global Market Index (GMI.F) continued to rise last week. This unmanaged benchmark, which holds all the major asset classes (except cash) in market-value weights, increased 0.5% \u2014 the index\u2019s third straight weekly advance.\n\nFor one-year results, however, US REITs remain firmly in the lead. VNQ is up 14.8% for the trailing 12 months on a total-return basis through Friday\u2019s close.\n\nBroadly defined commodities remained dead last for one-year results. The iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (NYSE: ) is down 14.0% over the past year, although the attacks on Saudi oil facilities will probably strengthen commodity prices (energy in particular) this week.\n\nETF Performance 1yr % Total Return\n\nGMI.F continues to post a moderate total return for the trailing one-year window, rising 4.9% at last week\u2019s close.\n\nProfiling the major asset classes via momentum indicators continues to paint a relatively strong trend, albeit one that will be tested this week in the wake of heightened geopolitical risk in the Middle East. At last week\u2019s close, a moderate upside bias was in place, based on two sets of moving averages for the ETFs listed above. The first compares the 10-day moving average with its 100-day counterpart \u2014 a proxy for short-term trending behavior (red line in chart below). A second set of moving averages (50 and 200 days) represent an intermediate measure of the trend (blue line). At Friday\u2019s close, short-term momentum posted a rebound after weakness in the previous week. But all eyes are now focused on how the attacks on Saudi Arabia reshuffle the risk outlook for the global economy and markets.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by James Picerno covering: iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets, Vanguard REIT, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets.
