They expect to wrap up the work by late next year.\n\nMGM\u2019s insurers will fund a minimum of $735 million. Depending on the number of victims who participate, the company will contribute more, up to $800 million, according to the victims\u2019 attorneys.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s agreement marks a milestone in the recovery process for the victims of the horrifying events of 1 October,\u201d Robert Eglet, a lead plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, said in the statement. \u201cWhile nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families.\u201d\n\nA country music festival became a killing ground when a 64-year-old retired accountant and high-stakes video poker player fired out the windows of his hotel room into the crowd.\n\nStephen Paddock killed himself as authorities closed in, and they found 23 assault-style weapons in his room, many equipped with bump stocks that allow firearms to fire rapidly like machine guns.\n\nPolice and the FBI found that Paddock meticulously planned the attack and theorized that he may have sought notoriety. But they said they never determined a clear motive.\n\nAs legal claims piled up, MGM drew outrage when it filed lawsuits last year against more than 1,900 victims, arguing it had no liability to survivors or families of slain victims under a federal law enacted after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nAnother attorney for victims is planning a news conference Thursday in San Diego.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Attorneys for victims of the Las Vegas shooting that took 58 lives say a settlement, expected between $735 and $800 million, was reached.", "authors": ["Ken Ritter"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/las-vegas-shooting-mourning.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
