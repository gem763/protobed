I\u2019ve just been fired from Deadspin for not sticking to sports,\u201d tweeted Barry Petchesky.\n\nHi! I\u2019ve just been fired from Deadspin for not sticking to sports. \u2014 Barry Petchesky (@barry) October 29, 2019\n\nTop postings on Tuesday included \u201cWoman Furiously S\u2014s on Floor of Tim Hortons, Throws it At Employees,\u201d as well as \u201cWhat Did We Get Stuck in Our Rectums Last Year,\u201d and \u201cThe Hateful Life and Spiteful Death of the Man Who Was Vig the Carpatian.\u201d\n\nAlso prominently featured on Deadspin\u2019s web site Tuesday was an Aug. 23 story by Deadspin\u2019s former editor Megan Greenwell blasting Spanfeller, who was named CEO after private equity firm Grey Hill Partners bought Deadspin, along with Gizmodo and Life Hacker and the Onion, from Univision in April.\n\nThe article by Greenwell, who then jumped to Wired magazine, claimed Spanfeller had been filling open executive jobs at G/O with \u201colder white guys\u201d drawn from his days as CEO at Forbes Media and executive VP at Playboy Enterprises. Deadspin has denied the criticisms, saying nearly half of its executive hires have been women.\n\nThe executive behind Monday\u2019s explosive memo, G/O Media editorial director Paul Maidment, defended the company\u2019s decision in a second memo on Tuesday \u2014 suggesting management is digging in their heels on the sports coverage.\n\n\u201cYesterday I sent a memo to Deadspin staff stating that our sports site should be focused on sports coverage. As I made clear in that note, sports touches on nearly every aspect of life \u2014 from politics to business to pop culture and more. We believe that Deadspin reporters and editors should go after every conceivable story, as long as it has something to do with sports.\u201d\n\nMaidment, didn\u2019t mention the fired Petchesky by name, but appeared to refer to him in the update. \u201cWe are sorry that some on the Deadspin staff don\u2019t agree with that editorial direction and refuse to work within that incredibly broad mandate.\u201d\n\nThe web site\u2019s union, Writers Guild of America East, suggested it could push back against additional firings, however. \u201cEarlier today, @Jim Spanfeller, CEO of G/O Media fired our colleague and longtime Deadspin deputy editor Barry Petchesky. This will not stand,\u201d it tweeted.\n\nThe revolt comes as aggressive cost cutting appears to have dramatically improved the company\u2019s finances. In early October, G/O Media said that the company actually posted a quarterly profit after laying off 25 staffers since Grey Hill Partners\u2019 April takeover. On October 10, the company also abruptly shut down its snarky web site Splinter, saying it did not see a long term path to profitability.\n\nThis report originally appeared on NYPost.com.", "description": "An internal revolt is underway at news site Deadspin as staffers refuse to follow orders from their G/O Media bosses to file only sports stories.", "authors": ["Keith J.
