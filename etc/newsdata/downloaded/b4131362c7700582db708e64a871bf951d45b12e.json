Carolina's Cape Hatteras", "language": "en", "text": "WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) - The Latest on Hurricane Dorian (all times local):\n\n8:05 a.m.\n\nHurricane Dorian\u2019s center is near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as it continues its crawl up the East Coast.\n\nThe storm\u2019s maximum sustained winds Friday morning are near 90 mph (150 kph), making it a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center says the storm is centered about 10 miles (15 kilometers) west-southwest of Cape Hatteras and is moving northeast near 14 mph (22 kph).\n\nDorian hammered the Bahamas earlier this week, killing at least 30 people. But it swept past Florida at a relatively safe distance, grazed Georgia, and then hugged the South Carolina-North Carolina coastline. At least four deaths in the Southeast have been blamed on the storm.\n\n___\n\n6:45 a.m.\n\nHurricane Dorian continues to scrape the North Carolina coast just offshore, with the worst weather hitting the Outer Banks.\n\nThe storm\u2019s strong winds and heavy rains early Friday knocked out power to about 194,000 homes and businesses in North Carolina.\n\nPowerOutage.US reports 160,000 outages remain in South Carolina after Dorian scraped that state\u2019s coast Thursday.\n\nAuthorities haven\u2019t reported any major damage, but were waiting for daylight to make a more comprehensive assessment.\n\nThe center of the storm has remained off the North Carolina coast. A weather station on Cape Lookout recorded winds of 75 mph (121 kph) as the eye of Dorian passes less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away.\n\n___\n\n6:38 a.m.\n\nPeople who live in southeastern Virginia are beginning to lose their electricity as Dorian blows up the Atlantic Coast.\n\nDominion Energy reported on its website Friday that more than 7,000 people have lost power. Most of the outages are in the cities of Virginia Beach and Chesapeake. Both cities border North Carolina and are home to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe city of Norfolk is also reporting outages.\n\nMuch of Virginia\u2019s Hampton Roads region is already shut down in anticipation of the storm. Schools have closed. Mass transit has stopped running. And the area\u2019s large military bases are operating with only mission-essential personnel.\n\n___\n\n5 a.m.\n\nThe eye of Hurricane Dorian is passing just east of Cape Lookout as the Category 1 storm skirts North Carolina\u2019s coast.\n\nSustained, hurricane-force winds are battering the southern Outer Banks, a 200-mile-long (320-kilometer-long) chain of low-lying barrier islands and spits off North Carolina. The center of the storm is around 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Cape Lookout and 55 miles (89 kilometers) southwest of Cape Hatteras, further north in the Outer Banks.\n\nTop sustained winds are near 90 mph (145 kph) and the storm is moving northeast at 14 mph (22 kph).\n\nAs of 5 a.m., the National Hurricane Center replaced a hurricane warning with a tropical storm warning from South Santee River to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. The storm-surge warning south of Surf City, North Carolina, has been discontinued.\n\n___\n\n4:15 a.m.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami is reporting hurricane-force wind gusts along the southern Outer Banks of North Carolina.\n\nA weather station at Cape Lookout on the southern end of the chain of low-lying islands recently reported a 10-minute average wind of 63 mph (101 kph), equivalent to a 1-minute sustained wind speed of 69 mph (111 kph). A wind gust of 75 mph (121 kph) was also reported, but the weather station inside the western part of Dorian\u2019s eye hasn\u2019t reported data since 3 a.m.\n\nDorian\u2019s center is around 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Cape Lookout, and around 80 miles (129 kilometers) southwest of Cape Hatteras, further north on the string of barrier islands and spits.\n\nThe Category 1 storm\u2019s top sustained winds remain at 90 mph (145 kph) and the storm is still moving northeast at 14 mph (22 kph).\n\n___\n\n3:10 a.m.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami is reporting hurricane-force winds \u201cjust offshore\u201d Cape Lookout, part of the low-lying islands that make up North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks.\n\nThe Category 1 storm is located around 25 miles (40 kilometers) south-southwest of Cape Lookout, and around 90 miles (145 kilometers) southwest of Cape Hatteras, further north on the string of barrier islands and spits.\n\nTop sustained winds remain at 90 mph (145 kph) and the storm is moving northeast at 14 mph (23 kph).\n\nThe storm is expected to weaken slowly over the next few days, but will likely remain a powerful hurricane as it moves along the coast of North Carolina.\n\n___\n\n2 a.m.\n\nHurricane Dorian has weakened somewhat to a Category 1 storm, but forecasters say the threat posed to the southeastern U.S. coast hasn\u2019t abated.\n\nDorian is currently 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Wilmington, North Carolina, and 30 miles (48 kilometers) south-southwest of Cape Lookout, North Carolina, and moving northeast at 15 mph (24 kph). The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami says that general motion is expected to continue, with an increase in speed through Saturday.\n\nThe center of the storm will move near or over the coast of North Carolina over the next several hours, before moving to the \u201csoutheast of extreme southeastern New England\u201d on Friday night and Saturday morning and then across Nova Scotia.\n\nA storm surge warning has been discontinued south of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, but flooding remains possible in parts of North Carolina depending on the tide and the storm\u2019s distance from the coast.\n\n___\n\n1:40 a.m.\n\nAfter triggering tornadoes in South Carolina, Hurricane Dorian is closing in for a possible direct hit Friday on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks, a string of low-lying islands.\n\nOn Ocracoke Island, near the southern end of the 200-mile-long (322-kilometer-long) string of barrier islands and spits, about half of the 1,000 residents have stuck around to face the storm.\n\nFurther north, Virginia was also in harm\u2019s way.\n\nOvernight winds are expected to cause trees and branches to fall on power lines, and debris could block repair crews from accessing damaged line.\n\nAs of early Friday, Dorian was centered about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east-northeast of Wilmington, North Carolina and had weakened to a Category 1 storm. With maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (145 kph), Dorian was moving northeast at 15 mph (24 kph).\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Hurricane Dorian (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/tropical_weather_south_carolina_22130_c0-128-3105-1938_s1770x1032.jpg?15ab8be9fe8195118c591c82f314c2b7b1ce77da", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
