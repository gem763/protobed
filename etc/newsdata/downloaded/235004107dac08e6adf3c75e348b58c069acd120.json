The Fed lowered borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.\n\n\u201cThe winds of recession aren\u2019t coming closer to shore if the consumer continues to buy their hearts out,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG. \u201cFed officials are unlikely to cut rates too much deeper as they seek to get out in front of the risks the economy faces acting early instead of being too late.\u201d\n\nRetail sales rose 0.4% last month, lifted by spending on motor vehicles, building materials, healthcare and hobbies. Data for August was revised slightly up to show retail sales increasing 0.8% instead of 0.7% as previously reported.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.2% in August. Compared to August last year, retail sales advanced 4.1%. Retail sales have increased for six straight months, the longest such stretch since June 2017.\n\nBut with the Trump administration this month slapping a 15% tariff on Chinese consumer goods such as televisions, apparel, bed linens, smart watches and footwear, there are concerns retail sales could pull back. Economists and retail groups expect businesses will pass on the duties to consumers, thereby raising prices for the targeted goods.\n\n\u201cIt is too early to assess the impact of the new tariffs that took effect at the beginning of this month, but they do present downside risks to household spending,\u201d said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation in Washington.\n\nHouseholds\u2019 worries about the new round of tariffs were also underscored by a small rise in consumer sentiment early this month. The University of Michigan said its survey of consumers found that concerns about the impact of tariffs on the economy rose in early September.\n\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales climbed 0.3% last month after increasing by a slightly downwardly revised 0.9% in July. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have jumped 1.0% in July.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at a 4.7% annualized rate in the second quarter, the most in 4-1/2 years.\n\nEconomists expect consumer spending will slow to just below a 4.0% rate in the third quarter, which would be more than enough to keep the economy growing at a steady pace, rather than tipping into recession as signaled by financial markets.\n\nThe dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Major U.S. stock indexes were largely unchanged.\n\nGROWTH LOCOMOTIVE\n\n\u201cThe trend in consumer spending growth still looks very solid,\u201d said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \u201cConsumers remain the locomotive of the economy.\u201d\n\nStrong consumer spending is encouraging retailers to boost inventory. A second report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed business inventories increased 0.4% in July after being unchanged in June. Stocks at retailers rebounded 0.8%, the most in six months, after falling 0.2% in June.\n\nThe inventory increase bodes well for GDP growth this quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting the economy to grow at a 1.8% rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% rate in the April-June quarter, down from the first quarter\u2019s brisk 3.1% pace.\n\nFinancial markets have fully priced in a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. Most economists expect additional monetary policy easing in October and December. While underlying consumer prices have accelerated in the past three months, inflation is likely to remain benign.\n\nIn a fourth report on Friday, the Labor Department said import prices dropped 0.5% last month amid declines in the cost of petroleum products and food. In the 12 months through August, import prices decreased 2.0% after dropping 1.9% in July.\n\nImport prices have now declined for five straight months on an annual basis.\n\nLow inflation, the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century and about $1.27 trillion in personal savings are underpinning consumer spending. Even as the economy has been slowing, layoffs have remained low.\n\nLast month, auto sales accelerated 1.8% after edging up 0.1% in July. Sales at building material and gardening equipment stores jumped 1.4%, the most since January.\n\nOnline and mail-order retail sales increased 1.6% after shooting up 1.7% in July. Receipts at health and personal care stores rose 0.7%, mirroring a jump in healthcare inflation in August. Americans also spent more at hobby, musical instrument and book stores, boosting sales 0.9%.\n\nReceipts at service stations fell 0.9%, reflecting cheaper gasoline. But there were pockets of weakness in sales. Receipts at clothing stores fell 0.9% last month and sales at electronics and appliance stores were unchanged.\n\nFurniture sales dropped 0.5%, the largest decrease in eight months. Americans also cut back on spending at restaurants and bars, with sales declining 1.2%, the most since September 2018.", "description": "U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in August, pointing to solid consumer spending that should continue to support a moderate pace of economic growth.", "authors": ["Lucia Mutikani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429663099&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D00V", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
