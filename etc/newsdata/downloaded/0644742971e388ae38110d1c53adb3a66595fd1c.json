Taylor Swift's 20 best songs 1/20 20) \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d This song is sadly marred by the controversy that surrounded its accompanying video (its references to films such as Out of Africa drew accusations that it presented a \u201cwhite colonialist fantasy\u201d.) The track itself is a dreamy, lush soundscape filled with breathless sighs and dramatic pauses that recall Swift\u2019s fellow old Hollywood obsessive, Lana Del Rey. Youtube 2/20 19) \u201cPaper Rings\u201d A pop-punk song! Swift is at her most energetic on a song that has more than a hint of Toni Basil\u2019s \u201cMickey\u201d, from the hand-clapping beat to the distorted scuzz added to her vocals. 3/20 18) \u201cStyle\u201d Until \u201cDress\u201d appeared on Reputation, \u201cStyle\u201d was Swift\u2019s most bold and sensuous song, driven by a pulsing beat and an urgent electric guitar riff. It plays on the idea that it\u2019s easy to leave someone but a lot harder to stay away, especially if your lover has that \u201cJames Dean daydream look in [their] eye\u201d. Vevo 4/20 17) \u201cMiss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince\u201d Swift evokes Lana Del Rey again as she sings over a stuttery beat about two characters that could have been plucked right out of Hollywood\u2019s golden age. Getty 5/20 16) \u201cBack to December\u201d This was a first for Swift, who apologises to an ex who treated her perfectly, while she perhaps didn\u2019t value the relationship as much. It\u2019s a noteworthy song simply to point out that Swift, who has faced multiple accusations of \u201cusing\u201d her relationships to drag her ex-boyfriends, is more than capable of self-criticism. Vevo 6/20 15) \u201cLove Story\u201d A Swift classic about star-crossed lovers, inspired by (what else?) Romeo and Juliet. This is a country pop song is a prime example of Swift\u2019s skill as a story teller \u2013 one who understands the power of a forbidden romance. Vevo 7/20 14) \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d Swift emulates Bruce Springsteen on this Eighties synth-pop \u201cget in the car and go\u201d epic, which lasts not a second too long and ends so abruptly that it leaves you gasping to catch your breath. Photo by Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images 8/20 13) \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d One of the most underrated songs on Reputation has Swift embracing the role of villain after years of being accused of using men as a songwriting tool, along with the fallout from her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. There\u2019s so much more bite on this track than \u201cBlank Space\u201d, despite the similar themes \u2013 here she is merciless upon learning a man has used her name, or spent her money, behind her back. (Photo by Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images) 9/20 12) \u201cTim McGraw\u201d There\u2019s something very moving about Swift opening her first album with a song that intertwines the old and the new. Nashville is notoriously unkind to female country artists, particularly young ones, so you can\u2019t help but admire a then-16-year-old Swift, who offered a profound respect to one of her biggest inspirations on her debut single. Vevo 10/20 11) \u201cDress\u201d This song is essentially one big, lustful sigh: Swift seems to delight in a secret romance where she \u201conly bought this dress so you could take it off\u201d and quite literally pants with anticipation. Getty Images for TAS 11/20 10) \"Lover\" A tender Sixties-style acoustic ballad that shows Swift experimenting with rhythm and meter in a way that\u2019s impressively bold this far into her career. Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images for ABA 12/20 9) \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d While Red signalled Swift\u2019s full-blown transition into pop music, she couldn\u2019t resist putting the odd country twang on songs such as \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d, which mocks an ex for being snobbish about his \u201cindie record label that\u2019s much cooler than mine\u201d. The most spectacular is really the beginning of the song, where she delivers an astounded \u201cwhat?\u201d upon being told the guy needs space: \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen each other in a month.\u201d 13/20 8) \u201cDear John\u201d John Mayer lashed out over this song in 2012, clearly upset after Swift alluded that it was about their past relationship. He called it \u201ccheap songwriting\u201d in reference to using their personal lives for material \u2013 whatever you think of that, it\u2019s features of her best vocal performances and brilliant songwriting \u2013 right down to the Mayer-ism of that wavering electric guitar line. Then there are the lyrics themselves: \u201cYou are an expert at sorry/ And keeping lines blurry/ And never impressed by me acing your tests/ All the girls that you\u2019ve run dry/ Have tired, lifeless eyes/ \u2019Cause you burned them out.\u201d Medic! Taylor Swift. Credit: Getty 14/20 7) \u201cDelicate\u201d One of Swift\u2019s greatest talents as a songwriter is to encapsulate those small moments, often in a new relationship, that you as a listener cannot. Her skittishness on \u201cDelicate\u201d, about the danger of rushing into something, of sharing too much of yourself too soon with someone you\u2019re still getting to know, is all too palpable as the beat switches up like a nervous heart. (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for TIME) 15/20 6) \u201cCall It What You Want\u201d The lyrics here are more open and willingly vulnerable than anything Swift had done before; that line on the chorus where she sings: \u201cMy baby\u2019s fly like a jet stream/ high above the whole scene/ loves me like I\u2019m brand new\u201d hits hard. The song appears on Reputation, released after Swift\u2019s lengthy hiatus from the spotlight, and its lyrics speak of a person blissfully content in her relationship \u2013 to the point that the outside world is just white noise. It includes some of her finest lyrics, too, with superb references to those castles of old crumbling \u201covernight\u201d and nods to her Anglophilia (\u201cmy baby\u2019s fit like a daydream\u201d). Getty Images 16/20 5) \u201cOur Song\u201d \u201cMean\u201d is beaten only by \u201cOur Song\u201d as Swift\u2019s most \u201ccountry\u201d release, helped a lot by her endearing portrait of \u201cthe slam of screen doors\u201d and driving along country lanes listening to the radio. Swift is a master of the meta-narrative, so her making a song about a song based on sounds from real-life is all kinds of perfect. YouTube/screengrab 17/20 4) \u201cGetaway Car\u201d On \u201cGetaway Car\u201d Swift channels one of her friend and producer Jack Antonoff\u2019s favourites \u2013 Kate Bush \u2013 as she belts that epic \u201cgo, go, go!\u201d, while the song in its entirety recalls Bonnie Tyler\u2019s \u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart\u201d \u2013 cellos and violins enhancing the drama. Getty Images for NARAS 18/20 3) \u201cBlank Space\u201d \u201cBlank Space\u201d was a real moment for Swift, where she turned all of the tabloid gossip, all of the malicious scrutiny around her love life, back on the world with a wink and a nod. \u201cGot a long list of ex-lovers/ They\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m insane,\u201d she trills on the chorus, throwing out punchline after punchline until the exquisite: \u201cYou\u2019ll come back, each time you leave/ \u2018cos darling I\u2019m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.\u201d 19/20 2) \"Afterglow\" Against a similar soundscape to \"Wildest Dreams\", Swift is at her most confessional as she explains how her own insecurities can lead to self-destruction in a relationship \u2013 and pleads with her lover to be patient with her. \u201cIt\u2019s all me, in my head,\" she sings. \"I\u2019m the one who burned us down/ But it\u2019s not what I meant/ Sorry that I hurt you.\u201d 20/20 1) \u201cAll Too Well\u201d Swift\u2019s mastery of storytelling has never been better than on this, a standout song not just from Red, but of her career to date. It\u2019s the slow-build from those bittersweet memories of \u201cdancing in the refrigerator light\u201d to a devastating, stadium-sized anthem that leads to her delivering arguably her best-ever line \u2013 with one of her best vocal performances: \u201cYou call me up again just to break me like a promise/ So casually cruel in the name of being honest.\u201d Rex 1/20 20) \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d This song is sadly marred by the controversy that surrounded its accompanying video (its references to films such as Out of Africa drew accusations that it presented a \u201cwhite colonialist fantasy\u201d.)

It was the second time he had been arrested at the address in 2018, after reportedly breaking down her front door with a shovel on 13 February.\n\nAfter serving six months in prison for the April 13 break-in, Alvarado was arrested again on March 2019 after allegedly climbing a ladder to a second-floor patio and smashing a door to get inside her Manhattan townhouse. No one was home at the time.\n\nSwift said in a recent interview with Elle that she fears for her personal safety after several stalking and intruder incidents.\n\n\u201cWebsites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I\u2019ve ever had online,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things.\u201d", "description": "A 26-year-old man has been charged with\u00a0wilful trespassing after breaking into Taylor Swift\u2018s beach-front mansion in Rhode Island.", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/15/17/gettyimages-1146331516.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
