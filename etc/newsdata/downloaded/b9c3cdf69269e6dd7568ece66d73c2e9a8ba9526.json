It doesn't mean necessarily [that we need] to have the same distance [of races],\" Lappartient said. \"For example, we had 260km today with the elite race, I think this is not something that we can put [forward] for the ladies.\n\n\"For the time trial, it is something that is also under discussion, of course, but it is something that also is approved by coaches of both men and women.\"", "description": "David Lappartient, the International Cycling Union president, has defended the decision for junior women's races at last week's Road World Championships in Yorkshire to be contested over just half the distance of their male counterparts.", "authors": ["John Macleary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cycling/2019/09/30/TELEMMGLPICT000210581308-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkLlh3POrDignFsDqzMZFcxQutTHrdaZ13ovs5o8PW_E.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
