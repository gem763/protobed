Lehtikuva/Martti Kainulainen via REUTERS\n\nEconomic growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro halved to 0.2% in the second quarter compared with the first. The euro zone\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, is on the brink of a recession, contracting 0.1% in that period.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi said the euro zone economy was in a period of \u201cprotracted\u201d economic weakness, with inflation low and the balance of risks tilted to the downside, as he announced a fresh stimulus package on Thursday, cutting interest rates and beginning a new round of bond purchases.\n\nHe urged governments to spend their way out of the slowdown and use fiscal policy to help the ECB\u2019s stimulus. He singled out Germany, which is committed to running a balanced budget.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, arriving for informal euro zone finance ministers\u2019 talks in Helsinki, responded by proposing a \u201cgrowth compact\u201d for the euro zone that would focus on investment, reforms and debt reduction .\n\nBut no joint fiscal action was discussed at the meeting of the 19 finance ministers representing countries that share the euro. They said the economy was, after all, still growing.\n\n\u201cWe ... stand ready to act if risks materialize and things get worse,\u201d Mario Centeno, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, the Eurogroup, told a news conference.\n\n\u201cAt the Eurogroup, we will coordinate our response. I should add that overall, and despite all the uncertainty, we remain positive about the euro area economy, which is still growing, albeit at a slower pace,\u201d he said.\n\nONUS ON GERMANY\n\nTo counter an economic slowdown after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the EU in late 2008 agreed on a coordinated stimulus of 200 billion euros, or 1.5 percent of EU GDP at the time. The European Economic Response Plan, as it was called, did not prevent a recession in 2009 but helped a recovery in 2010.\n\n\u201cIn the last crisis, we were able to find a balance in our comprehensive response, combining fiscal policy, structural reforms at national and EU levels and also monetary policy,\u201d Centano said. \u201cGoing forward, in the face of a downturn, we need to find a new balance, and fiscal policy will surely play a part on this.\u201d\n\nCenteno, as well as European Commission Vice President for the euro Valdis Dombrovskis and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, pointed to \u201ccountries with fiscal space\u201d as those who should spend more to help revive growth.\n\nIn EU code, that means Germany and the Netherlands. Both have been running budget surpluses for years and are big enough to have an impact throughout the euro zone if they start spending more.\n\nThose who already have high debt should embark on structural reforms to boost growth, top officials said. But Italy, the most indebted euro zone nation after Greece, said the EU\u2019s fiscal rules need to be relaxed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going (to Helsinki) to discuss European policies, starting from the need of a more expansionary fiscal policy,\u201d said Roberto Gualtieri, Italy\u2019s new economy minister.\n\nCenteno also noted that in time, the euro zone budget which is to come into being in 2021, would help with investment spending.\n\n\u201cAnother important element of a new balance of policies is ... the Budgetary Instrument for Convergence and Competitiveness for the euro area,\u201d he said.\n\nECB executive board member Benoit Coeure, who took part in the ministerial meeting, told the news conference the future euro zone budget, now focused on investment, was welcome and would reinforce the actions taken by the ECB, but it would have been better if it also helped counter economic downturns.\n\nThe Netherlands has strongly rejected that possibility.", "description": "Euro zone finance ministers are not planning any joint fiscal stimulus to complement the European Central Bank's monetary package, but they are ready to act if the economy takes a turn for the worse, their chairman said on Friday.", "authors": ["Jan Strupczewski", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429448300&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C17Y", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
