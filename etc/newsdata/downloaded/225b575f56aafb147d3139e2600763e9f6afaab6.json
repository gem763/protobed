But I\u2019ve been so mad this morning and so upset about this news that we are abandoning our Kurdish allies in the Middle East. These are allies of ours that American soldiers are still continuing to fight alongside. All we did was arm them, and they fought for America.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cRight now we\u2019re just saying we\u2019re just going to leave them and abandon them, and to everyone in the White House and every Republican who was mad President Obama pulled out of Iraq, you feckless, unpatriotic cowards. I cannot believe this is where we\u2019re at diplomatic-wise, and I cannot \u2014 what message is this sending to our allies and to our American troops who have fought and died for this, and I cannot believe I\u2019m waking up in the morning seeing this kind of news.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t care that he ran on pulling troops out. That\u2019s a whole different thing. We leave this, this a great day for ISIS, and this is a great day for Assad, and shame on everyone supporting this. I\u2019m sorry this is not the topic, but I couldn\u2019t come out here today and not say this.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of ABC's 'The View\" co-host Meghan McCain criticized Republicans who were silent after President Donald Trump's announcement U.S. troops will withdraw from northern Syria\u00a0where they have been fighting with Kurdish forces. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/Meghan-McCain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
