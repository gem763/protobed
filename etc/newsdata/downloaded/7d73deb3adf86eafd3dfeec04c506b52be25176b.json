Three hundred in all have signed up. No questions in advance, no picking and choosing which reporter gets to ask a question.\n\n\u201cI wanted to have an informal meeting,\u201d Zelensky said as things got underway at 10 a.m. in the Kyiv Food Market, a retro modern development stocked with a couple of dozen different stalls. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one like this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say, no one else has, either.\n\nAD\n\nAmerican reporters want to know about Trump, of course.\n\n\u201cThere was no pressure or blackmail from the U.S.,\u201d he told the first group.\n\nUkrainians are more interested in Zelensky\u2019s decision last week to back a mechanism that could, possibly, lead to peace talks that, could, just maybe, lead to a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. It was widely felt that his office botched that announcement, drawing intense criticism from those who interpreted it as a capitulation to Russia. He has been trying to reassure the country ever since.\n\n\u201cI want to stop this war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my mission through these next five years.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut what about his mission through the next five, six, nine hours? How many times will he be asked the same question? Will his voice hold out? His sunny disposition?\n\nAnd, if this is his attempt to put all the Trump-Biden-Putin-Donetsk-Burisma-Giuliani controversies behind him once and for all \u2014 well, that\u2019s not too likely, is it? But maybe it\u2019s worth a shot.\n\nEnglund reported from Moscow.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cI wanted to have an informal meeting.\u201d So Volodymyr Zelensky meets 300 journalists at a hip food hall.", "authors": ["Natalie Gryvnyak", "Will Englund", "Assignment Editor On The Washington Post'S Foreign Desk", "A Veteran Moscow Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pp2HRsmmCkUAH9Ry5LERmhRO7Es=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DTMD43HLGQI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
