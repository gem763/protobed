27 already have, Barclays would do well to follow their lead.'\n\nMeanwhile, Gareth Shaw, head of money at consumer group, Which?, said: 'Barclays has shown real disregard to the needs of its customers through its reckless move to cease cash withdrawals from the Post Office.\n\n'MPs are right to challenge this ill-conceived decision that risks leaving many of their constituents facing an uphill struggle just to access the cash they need.\n\n'It's clear the broken cash landscape is being further damaged by industry's approach, which is why we're calling on the government to urgently intervene with legislation that protects cash for as long as it is needed.'\n\nThe Payment Systems Regulator has said it will be 'closely monitoring' the steps Barclays plans to take.\n\nBut, speaking last week, Adam Rowse, managing director of branch-based banking at Barclays, said: 'By maintaining last-in-town or remote branches over the next two years, and working with the community, we hope to increase demand and keep these branches viable.\n\n'We also recognise that there are opportunities to support customers with access to cash where there is no branch or ATM nearby.\n\n'We are launching a cashback offering working with merchants to give customers access to cash over the counter.'\n\nBarclays, which made a \u00a33.5billion profit last year and dished out \u00a33.4million in pay to boss Staley last year, has denied its decision is to do with cost-cutting and claims it is investing in schemes to help its customers access their money more easily.", "description": "Politicians have written a letter to the bank's boss, Jes Stayley, urging him to reverse the decision to prevent people from taking cash out at Post Office branches from 8 January 2020.", "authors": ["Jane Denton For Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
