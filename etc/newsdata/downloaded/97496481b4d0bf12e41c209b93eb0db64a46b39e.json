He also suggests that NBC News was worried that his Weinstein reporting would unearth allegations of sexual assault and harassment against the network\u2019s own former star, Matt Lauer.\n\nNBC President Noah Oppenheim released a scathing attack Monday on Farrow, denying the New Yorker writer\u2019s accusations and calling them a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nDespite the back and forth, \u201cone thing ... is indisputable,\u201d declared Hayes, \u201cRonan Farrow walked out of NBC News after working on the Weinstein story, and within two months published an incredible story in The New Yorker that not only won a Pulitzer but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the \u201ckind of journalism you want to do as a journalist,\u201d he said. But the reporting struggled to see the light of day because the \u201cpath of least resistance for those in power was not to cross Weinstein and his army of friends and lawyers,\u201d Hayes noted.\n\nThe same thing goes, Hayes said, for the \u201cmany, many, many other powerful predators we\u2019ve come to know about.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the very \u201cease of that path\u201d of least resistance, he warned, \u201cthat makes it the enemy of the kind of work that we, as journalists, are supposed to do.\u201d\n\nCheck it out in the video above.", "description": "The \u201cpath of least resistance for those in power was not to cross Weinstein and his army of friends and lawyers,\u201d Hayes charges in gutsy on-air challenge.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da53fb72100001a0e345108.png?cache=segzcal626&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
