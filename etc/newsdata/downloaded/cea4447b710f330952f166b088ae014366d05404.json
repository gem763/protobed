He uplifts the spirits, he is a bon viveur...I think despite the difference in background they see him as someone they can relate to, they think he says it as it is,' she told the Times newspaper.\n\n'They don't care about his girlfriends.'\n\nSunday Times journalist Charlotte Edwardes (pictured left) said that Boris Johnson (pictured right) grabbed 'enough inner flesh beneath his fingers' to make her 'sit upright' during a private lunch when he was the editor of the Spectator magazine in 1999. She also alleged that he did the same to another woman there\n\nFurther to the alleged sexual relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, Sunday Times columnist Charlotte Edwardes has accused Johnson of squeezing her thigh under a table in 1999 when he was the editor of the Spectator magazine.\n\nShe said that he grabbed 'enough inner flesh beneath his fingers' to make her 'sit upright' and said that he did the same to another woman attending the private lunch.\n\nJohnson categorically denied the accusations.\n\nAccording to polling, women are less likely than men to vote for him yet, McVey doesn't feel as though he has an issue with women.\n\n'If Boris walks down the road people run along to have a selfie with him. Whether he is on his bike or getting into a cab he has a draw,' she said.\n\nSpeaking of the sexual harassment claims levied at him by journalist Charlotte Edwardes, she added: 'It was categorically denied. People are questioning the timing. People know he has had a colourful past, this isn't working against him.'", "description": "Boris Johnson's past behaviour won't hurt him in the polls as voters see him as 'box office' and they 'don't care about his girlfriends,' according to Housing Minister Esther McVey.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/16/19336568-0-image-a-17_1570290481412.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
