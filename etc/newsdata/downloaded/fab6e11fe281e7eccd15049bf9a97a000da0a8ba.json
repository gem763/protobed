Bouchard was trying to build the first new aluminum-rolling mill in the United States in nearly four decades, in a corner of northeastern Kentucky ravaged by job losses and the opioid epidemic \u2014 a project that stood to benefit enormously if Rusal were able to get involved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe men did not discuss the Senate debate that night at dinner, Bouchard said in an interview, describing it as an amicable introductory chat.\n\nBut the timing of their meeting shows how much a major venture in McConnell\u2019s home state had riding on the Democratic-backed effort in January to keep sanctions in place.\n\nBy the next day, McConnell had successfully blocked the bill, despite the defection of 11 Republicans.\n\nWithin weeks, the U.S. government had formally lifted sanctions on Rusal, citing a deal with the company that reduced the ownership interest of its Kremlin-linked founder, Oleg Deripaska. And three months later, Rusal announced plans for an extraordinary partnership with Bouchard\u2019s company, providing $200 million in capital to buy a 40 percent stake in the new aluminum plant in Ashland, Ky. \u2014 a project Gov. Matt Bevin (R) boasted was \u201cas significant as any economic deal ever made in the history of Kentucky.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for McConnell said the majority leader did not know that Bouchard had hopes of a deal with Rusal at the time McConnell led the Senate effort to end the sanctions, citing the recommendation of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell \u201cwas not aware of any potential Russian investor before the vote,\u201d spokesman David Popp said.\n\nBouchard said no one from his company, Braidy Industries, told anyone in the U.S. government that lifting sanctions could help advance the project. Rusal\u2019s parent company, EN+, said in a statement that the Kentucky project played no role in the company\u2019s vigorous lobbying campaign to persuade U.S. officials to do away with sanctions.\n\nBut critics said the timing is disturbing.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking how blatantly transactional this arrangement looks,\u201d said Michael McFaul, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration and now teaches at Stanford University.\n\nAD\n\nDemocratic senators have called for a government review of the deal, prompting a Rusal executive in Moscow last week to threaten to pull out of the investment.\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell defends blocking election security bill, rejects criticism he is aiding Russia\n\nThe Rusal-backed project is one of several issues fueling broader scrutiny of McConnell\u2019s posture toward Russia and its efforts to manipulate American voters.\n\nIn 2016, McConnell privately expressed skepticism about the intelligence reports on Russia\u2019s activities in the election and resisted a push by the Obama administration to issue a bipartisan statement condemning the Kremlin. Last month, he blocked consideration of election security bills that have bipartisan support, despite warnings from the FBI and the intelligence community about the risks of foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have accused McConnell of being unwilling to stand up to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, taunting him with the moniker \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d The critique has drawn an angry response from the usually understated majority leader.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was called unpatriotic, \u2018un-American\u2019 and essentially treasonous by a couple of left-wing pundits on the basis of boldfaced lies,\u201d McConnell said late last month. \u201cI was accused of \u2018aiding and abetting\u2019 the very man I\u2019ve singled out as our adversary and opposed for nearly 20 years: Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nA McConnell aide declined Tuesday to comment on discussions that occurred in a classified setting in 2016 but noted that the senator signed a bipartisan letter that fall requested by the Obama administration that warned state election officials about the risks of cyberattacks and urged them to be especially vigilant as Election Day approached.\n\nMcConnell has said since then that he supports efforts to improve election security and has budgeted more money for the effort but does not agree with proposals that would give the federal government control over election issues that traditionally have been handled by states.\n\nThe controversy shows how Russia\u2019s surreptitious 2016 activities, rather than uniting U.S. officials, have left Democrats and Republicans bitterly divided \u2014 and have triggered heated debate about Russian investments in American businesses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t be so picky,\u201d said Bouchard, who sold a Midwestern steel company he previously owned to another Russian company. He now says politics shouldn\u2019t get in the way of a good deal for Kentucky: \u201cWhoever is going to help us go in and rebuild this place that\u2019s been decimated, we just welcome it, with open arms.\u201d\n\nBut in Kentucky, some leaders are questioning the wisdom of partnering with a Russian company recently punished by the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cRusal is not okay,\u201d said Kelly Flood, a Democratic state legislator from Lexington who said she regrets a 2017 vote to invest $15 million of state taxpayer money in the project. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay that we\u2019re turning to Deripaska, given the damage he\u2019s done to our democracy. . . . Rusal\u2019s reputation is now ours.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAn attorney for Deripaska did not respond to a request for comment. He has denied being beholden to the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cWhile I realize I\u2019ve involuntarily become a lightning rod for the anger some Americans have about the elections result, they need to look elsewhere for a scapegoat,\u201d Deripaska told The Washington Post in February. \u201cI am nobody\u2019s man, in Russia, the U.S. or anywhere else, for that matter.\u201d\n\nA promise for Appalachia\n\nIn Ashland, a city of 22,000 wedged along Kentucky\u2019s border with West Virginia and Ohio, there has been enthusiasm for the Braidy Industries project, a venture the company says will bring as many as 650 new high-paying jobs to a region hit hard by the impending closure of a major steel mill and the decline of coal mining.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBouchard said the idea for the mill was his brainstorm: a new environmentally friendly, low-cost, nonunion facility rolling sheets of lightweight aluminum that are increasingly in demand to build cars and airplanes.\n\nHe said he was leaning toward building the mill in Indiana until an hours-long meeting with Bevin in March 2017 persuaded him to give Kentucky a closer look.\n\nBevin got the state legislature to agree in the waning hours of its 2017 annual session to make a $15 million equity investment in the Braidy project.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s skin in the game, and that means the state is behind you,\u201d Bouchard said.\n\nFlood said legislators were informed of the governor\u2019s proposal at 9 one night as they raced to meet a midnight deadline. She said they were told only that the appropriation was needed to create jobs in hard-hit Appalachia, and not how the money would be invested. The bill passed unanimously.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBevin, who in his bid for reelection is blasting Democrats as socialists, has fielded criticism that he steered the government to buy stock in a private company.\n\n\u201cThis is a handout. This is a giveaway,\u201d said Jim Waters of the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free-market think tank. He said he understood the desire to create jobs in a hard-hit region; some impact studies show the mill could indirectly result in thousands of new jobs. But, Waters added, \u201cI think the excitement of that overrode some of the due diligence.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Bevin did not respond to a request for comment. State officials have said the investment will make Kentucky more competitive to attract high-wage, high-tech jobs in the future.\n\nIn a 2017 radio interview, Bevin said he thought the Braidy project would be \u201ctransformative.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be one of the best investments the state has ever made,\u201d he said.\n\nEarly on, the Kentucky project apparently caught the attention of Rusal, which is the world\u2019s second-largest aluminum producer.\n\nA top Rusal executive told Bloomberg News in an interview in June that the project was \u201cdiscussed long before Rusal was sanctioned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just had to put the talks on hold after sanctions,\u201d he added.\n\nAn EN+ spokeswoman said the early conversations about the Kentucky project were all internal. She declined to comment further.\n\nTrump administration to impose fresh sanctions against Russia\n\nBouchard said he was talking to other possible investors for the project from the time the company first announced it would build in Kentucky in 2017. But he insisted they did not include Rusal \u2014 and said that a partnership with the Russian company was not even on his radar when the Treasury Department announced sanctions about a year later, in April 2018.\n\n\u201cNot even a thought,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sanctions allowed the government to freeze any Rusal assets in the United States and made it illegal for Americans to do business with the company.\n\nAt a groundbreaking for the mill a couple of months after the sanctions were announced, Bouchard and other speakers emphasized that the project would produce American-made aluminum sheets.\n\n\u201cThis is what hope feels like,\u201d Bevin said at the event, according to a video posted online, adding, \u201cWe are Kentucky.\u201d\n\nBut Bouchard said he encountered an unexpected problem: With aluminum ore in short supply, he was having trouble finding smelters with the capacity to produce enough raw material for his plant. He said he traveled the world, meeting with Rusal\u2019s competitors, but was able to find only 60,000 tons of raw aluminum to purchase. He needed more.\n\nIn late December, he said, an aluminum industry consultant alerted him to a new low-carbon smelter that Rusal was building in Siberia. Bouchard said he quickly concluded that the Rusal plant, set to open in 2021, could produce the aluminum Braidy needed.\n\nAt that point, he said, he became convinced that a partnership with Rusal would be a dream deal, providing his company with much-needed capital and access to raw aluminum. But sanctions, he said, stood in the way.\n\nBouchard said he contacted his attorneys for advice. They were clear: He could talk to Rusal, but he could not legally conduct negotiations with the company while sanctions were in place.\n\nThat same month, the Treasury Department announced plans to lift sanctions on Rusal. But Congress still had a chance to block the move.\n\nBouchard said that by the time of his January meeting with the Rusal executive in Zurich, he knew the sanctions could be ending. Still, he said, he thought the final decision could be months or years away.\n\nOn the night of his dinner in Zurich, which was first reported by Time magazine, the outcome of the sanctions debate remained uncertain, with some Republicans expressing concerns about the plan.\n\nOver the meal, Bouchard said, he told his Rusal counterpart: \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with sanctions. . . . I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a month or 10 years, but if the day comes and sanctions go away, I\u2019d love to meet again.\u201d\n\nEN+ declined to comment on the dinner.\n\nRolling back sanctions\n\nIn April 2018, after the poisoning of a Russian former spy in England, the United States imposed sanctions on some Russian entities, including Deripaska and his companies. \u201cRussian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government\u2019s destabilizing activities,\u201d Mnuchin said in a statement.\n\nA U.S. diplomatic cable from 2006, published by WikiLeaks, referred to Deripaska \u2014 who founded Rusal and had financial ties to Paul Manafort, the now-jailed former Trump campaign chairman \u2014 as \u201camong the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nIn announcing the new sanctions, the Treasury Department noted that Deripaska had been investigated for alleged money laundering and accused of \u201cthreatening the lives of business rivals\u201d and having ties to organized crime. The U.S. government has not accused Deripaska of personal involvement in Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDeripaska sued the U.S. government earlier this year, alleging that the sanctions relied on \u201cfalse rumors and innuendo and originate from decades-old defamatory attacks by Deripaska\u2019s business competitors\u201d and have led to the \u201cutter devastation\u201d of his reputation and economic well-being. He told CNBC in March that he thought the sanctions represented the \u201cweaponizing of the financial system\u201d and that they crushed \u201call concept of presumption of innocence and fair process.\u201d\n\nThe sanctions caused Rusal\u2019s stock price to plummet and disrupted the international aluminum market, drawing complaints from some U.S. trading partners.\n\nToo big to sanction? U.S. struggles with punishing large Russian businesses.\n\nIn December, Mnuchin said the Trump administration was prepared to lift sanctions imposed on Deripaska\u2019s companies, while keeping sanctions on Deripaska personally, to restore order to the international aluminum market.\n\nHe said that Deripaska had agreed as part of the deal to reduce his ownership stake in the companies he once controlled.\n\n\u201cThese entities are undergoing significant restructuring and governance changes that sever Deripaska\u2019s control and significantly diminish his ownership,\u201d Mnuchin said in the statement. \u201cIf these companies fail to comply with the terms, they will face very real and swift consequences.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress were skeptical.\n\n\u201cThere are too many open questions about whether Deripaska will still control the companies,\u201d Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in January. \u201cWith the threat that Russia poses to the United States, to our friends and allies, to democracy around the world, Congress cannot just look the other way when the administration rushes a decision like this.\u201d\n\nWith strong Republican support, the House on Jan. 14 overwhelmingly rejected the administration plan to lift sanctions, 362 to 53.\n\nBut the effort failed in the Senate, thanks in part to McConnell and strong lobbying efforts.\n\nThe effort to lift sanctions was led by Lord Gregory Barker, the new British chief executive of EN+, and included Republican ex-senator David Vitter of Louisiana, now a lobbyist at Mercury Public Affairs, according to public lobbying records.\n\nVitter and Mercury warned that failure to lift Rusal sanctions would \u201copen the Trump administration up to criticism for harming U.S. manufacturers and consumers,\u201d according to lobbying records. Vitter was spotted in McConnell\u2019s office days before the vote.\n\nMichael Crittenden, a spokesman for Mercury, said the Braidy project \u201ccategorically\u201d did not figure into the company\u2019s sanctions lobbying. He declined to comment on whether anyone at Mercury knew there was a possibility that Rusal might invest in the project if sanctions were lifted, citing a company policy about not commenting on client matters.\n\nJust before the vote, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned the Senate that providing sanctions relief \u201cgives Vladimir Putin exactly what he wants\u201d at a time that \u201cRussia continues to run rampant over international norms, to meddle in democratic elections, and to destabilize the world.\u201d\n\nMcConnell called Schumer\u2019s resolution \u201ca political stunt.\u201d And he rejected claims that he or others in the GOP were soft on Putin.\n\n\u201cWe Republicans are hardly strangers to the need for strong policies concerning Russia,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201cWe have long seen Vladimir Putin for the KGB thug that he is.\u201d\n\nAt McConnell\u2019s urging, the measure was defeated on Jan. 16, falling three votes short of the required three-fifths majority needed to overcome a threatened filibuster.\n\nGOP senators protect Trump administration\u2019s plan to lift Russian sanctions\n\nJoining in opposition was Kentucky\u2019s junior GOP senator, Rand Paul.\n\nA spokesman for Paul said the senator was unaware of the prospect of a major Rusal investment in Kentucky at the time and said he voted against the measure because he opposes sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea as a matter of principle.\n\n\u201cWe were not involved, consulted or aware of any investment discussions with any foreign entity\u201d before the sanctions vote, said Kelsey Cooper, Paul\u2019s communications director.\n\nSimilarly, McConnell said he was not motivated by any Kentucky interests.\n\n\u201cIt was completely unrelated to anything that might happen in my home state,\u201d McConnell told reporters at the Capitol in May. \u201cA number of us supported the administration. . . . And that\u2019s \u2014 that was how I voted \u2014 the reason I vote the way I did.\u201d\n\nA new partnership\n\nLess than two weeks after that January vote, the Treasury Department announced that it had accepted Rusal\u2019s plans to limit Deripaska\u2019s control over the company and removed sanctions.\n\nFour weeks later, Rusal executives were in Ashland, touring Braidy\u2019s mill site. By April, the new partnership was announced. As part of the deal, Barker, the British head of Rusal\u2019s holding company, will become co-chairman of Braidy Atlas, the company that will operate the mill.\n\nBouchard, who said he had watched the Senate sanctions vote live on television, was thrilled.\n\n\u201cFor me, to this day, this is one of the greatest things that\u2019s ever happened to northeast Kentucky \u2014 Rusal saying yes to our deal,\u201d Bouchard said. \u201cParticularly if you think about Appalachia and what\u2019s happened there \u2014 you know, those people today are jumping up and down and welcoming them, Rusal, because they\u2019re helping rebuild the community.\u201d\n\nWith sanctions lifted, EN+ is \u201cexploring and acting on strategically expanding our global partnership and opportunities, including in the United States,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nEN+ is \u201cthe only global producer capable\u201d of supplying Braidy with the low-carbon aluminum it had been seeking, and a result, \u201cthe whole project would not have been possible without Rusal\u2019s investment,\u201d the company said.\n\nDespite the 2018 groundbreaking, Bouchard agreed that getting the mill open would have been difficult without Rusal. \u201cIt would have imposed upon us a real challenge that would have been tough,\u201d he said.\n\nBraidy is gathering additional investors and hopes to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. The company plans to begin producing aluminum sheets by September 2021.\n\nIn Ashland, Braidy has opened a headquarters in a downtown office building, but it has not yet begun building on its site, city officials said.\n\nAnd some lawmakers are voicing concern about Rusal\u2019s role, including Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), a McConnell ally who has clashed with Bevin and criticized state investment in a project whose prospects he said appear uncertain.\n\n\u201cI hope we can get some jobs there. But it\u2019s not looking real good for this business,\u201d Comer said in a television interview in April. \u201cI would have not taken the Russian money if I was a start-up.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the chief financial officer of Rusal said during an earnings call reported by Bloomberg News that the company could pull out of the project if U.S. officials continue applying pressure on the company.\n\nThe comment was an apparent reference to recent efforts by Democratic senators, led by Ron Wyden of Oregon, to secure a review of the Kentucky deal from the U.S. government agency charged with examining national security implications of foreign investments.\n\nBarker issued a statement from London, saying Rusal\u2019s parent company \u201cremains committed\u201d to the project. Bouchard, in a separate statement, accused the media of \u201ctaking an active role in trying to undermine\u201d a project that could create many jobs.\n\nWyden rejected such complaints, saying he and several Senate colleagues were pushing ahead on a request for a review of the Russian investment.\n\n\u201cThe national security of the United States is more important than the preferences of a Russian company,\u201d Wyden said Sunday in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let up because Rusal finds oversight inconvenient.\u201d\n\nJeanne Whalen contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: This report has been updated to correct the name of the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free-market think tank, and the name of its president and chief executive.
