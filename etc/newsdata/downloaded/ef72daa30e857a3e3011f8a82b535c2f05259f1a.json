In so doing, we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an assessment paper released by taxation body HM Revenues and Customs says a no-deal Brexit could leave UK businesses with an annual bill of 15 billion pounds in administration and form-filling.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson insists the country will leave the European Union at the end of October, \"come what may, do or die\", regardless of whether or not a deal has been reached, even though Parliament is doing its best to prevent no-deal.\n\nLast week, he told the Conservative Party conference that leaving the EU would save the country 1 billion pounds per month, but the HM Customs figure, based on levels of trade from 2017, paints a very different picture.\n\nMeanwhile, the war of words over Brexit continues, with an unnamed Downing Street source saying that any agreement is \"essentially impossible not just now but ever\" after a reportedly frosty phone conversation between Johnson and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nMerkel's office declined to comment on confidential discussions, but European Council President Donald Tusk subsequently tweeted to Johnson \"what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people.\"\n\nMembers of the opposition Labour Party called the latest move a \"cynical attempt to sabotage the negotiations\".\n\nJohnson \"will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal\", said Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, calling upon politicians across the party divide in Parliament to \"unite to prevent this reckless government crashing us out of the EU\".", "description": "Britain's leading independent economic research institute said even the most \"relatively benign\" no-deal Brexit would increase debt in the United Kingdom to levels not seen since the 1960s.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d3b5ea310cf3e97a038d0.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
