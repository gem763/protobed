Yet instead of burning what they never quite had, the black and silver faithful found a smarter thing to do with the jerseys they spent a lot of money on.\n\nBreak out the black marker and turn them into Tim Brown No. 81 jerseys.\n\nStory continues\n\nTim Brown played 16 of his 17 career season with the Raiders, first when they were in Los Angeles (1988-1994) and then in Oakland (1995-2003). The Raiders lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII, his only title game appearance and the last showing for the Raiders.\n\nA 2015 Hall of Fame inductee and nine-time Pro Bowl selection, Brown had 1,070 receptions for 14,734 yards and 99 touchdowns for the silver and black. (He reached an even 100 receiving TDs, and 105 overall, during his one season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.)\n\nSo don\u2019t forget the dog\u2019s bandana. He deserves better, too.\n\nNice!

Some fans shared on Twitter they recently bought Brown jerseys before the saga exploded.\n\nJulian Edelman designed a \u201cBill\u2019s Plan: America\u2019s Worst Nightmare Tour\u201d T-shirt shortly after Brown signed. The NFL Shop already has Antonio Brown\u2019s Patriots jersey listed for sale, but is holding the shipment for 2-4 weeks until his number is confirmed. He is set to officially sign Monday afternoon.\n\nHis Raiders jersey is also deeply discounted, for what that\u2019s worth.\n\nOakland Raiders fans re-used their Antonio Brown jerseys in a genius way.
