She\u2019s right: Paper straws are not going to solve the ocean plastics crisis. Changing our relationship with single-use plastics will require action from the private sector, government, and individuals.\n\nAt the same time, let\u2019s not lose sight of just how ubiquitous plastic straws are.\n\nPlastic straws and stirrers are consistently among the top 10 items found during the Ocean Conservancy\u2019s International Coastal Cleanup each year. On a single day in 2018, volunteers around the world collected more than 3.6 million from beaches and waterways. Small and lightweight, they\u2019re easily left on the beach or leaked out of waste-management systems and into the ocean. Just one can harm a sea turtle.\n\nI am encouraged by how eager all of us are to \u201cskip the straw.\u201d Let\u2019s make sure our next steps are even more meaningful.\n\nJanis Searles Jones\n\nCEO, Ocean Conservancy\n\nPortland, Ore.\n\nI applaud Ms. Lowrey\u2019s explanation of the not-so-straightforward environmental trade-offs we make when trying to \u201cgo green.\u201d She is completely right when she says, \u201cPaper straws put the lie to the belief that we can consume our way out of the problems created by consumerism.\u201d But that is only half of the discussion.", "description": "\u201cPaper straws are not going to solve the ocean plastics crisis,\u201d a reader writes.
