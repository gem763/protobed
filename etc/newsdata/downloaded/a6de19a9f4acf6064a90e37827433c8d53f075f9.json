USTR will continually re-evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the EU,\" USTR said.\n\nAirbus and U.S. firm Boeing (N: ), the world's two largest planemakers, have waged a war of attrition over subsidies at the WTO since 2004, in a dispute that has tested the trade policeman's influence and is expected to set the tone for competition from would-be rivals from China.", "description": "Scottish whisky makers reel over U.S. tariffs in row over EU subsidies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF920Q2_L.jpg"}
