Beal, 26, is guaranteed to make nearly $130 million over the next four years.\n\nThis extension gives Beal a path toward NBA history. According to Woj, Beal could decline that player option in 2022 (as is his right when he reaches 10 years of NBA service) and re-sign with the Wizards for a staggering five-year, $266 million contract. That would be the richest contract in NBA history, and $68 million more than he would get if he decided to leave the Wizards to sign with another team.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBradley Beal has committed to the Washington Wizards for another two years.

Woj reported that Wizards owner Ted Leonsis spent months persuading Beal that he had a plan to get the Wizards back into contention. The campaign proved successful \u2014 Beal\u2019s agent has said that there\u2019s nowhere else Beal wants to be.\n\nCan confirm Bradley Beal has agreed to an extension with the #Wizards.\n\n\n\n\"This is where he wants to be. He's made it clear.\" -- Beal's agent Mark Bartelstein said.\n\n\n\nBeal WANTS to be part of the team's rebuild.\n\n\n\nExtension first reported by @wojespn \u2014 Candace Buckner (@CandaceDBuckner) October 17, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is a huge blow to the free-agent market, though. Beal was one of the most promising young stars coming available, and could have helped a team looking for one final difference-maker to put it over the top. But Beal got what he wanted: a huge extension, and to stay in Washington. Now he\u2019s even got a chance to make NBA history \u2014 and a whole lot of cash.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Bradley Beal is committing to the Wizards and their rebuild, and setting himself up to make NBA history.", "authors": ["Liz Roscher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pulTijAbmOCaoT3aK8AC7Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjUuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UqgFLglgSO4_acqxgw7aPw--~B/aD0yMzE1O3c9MzIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c76c6840-f0dd-11e9-be31-8a9baabcfb4f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
