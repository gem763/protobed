There is no antidote or vaccine, and the only known way to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass culling of affected livestock.The ministry earlier expressed concerns over a possible rise in pork prices, as its quarantine officials had been culling pigs within a 3-kilometer (1.9-mile) radius of ASF-infected farms, leading to a tight supply.Korea, Asia\u2019s fourth-biggest pork consumer, has slaughtered and buried more than 150,000 pigs since the outbreak started.Since the outbreak of the animal disease, the local price of pork had jumped more than 30 percent but later lost ground as consumers avoided consuming pork despite the fact that the virus is not harmful to people.The Agricultural Ministry and agricultural organizations have been urging the public not to avoid pork due to ASF.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
