Eight hours into the event, a man in a vest bearing the word \u201cexpert\u201d presented Zelenskiy with an award for holding the world\u2019s longest press conference, an honour previously held by the leader of Belarus.\n\nOver the course of the day, Zelenskiy told shifts of journalists he had not been blackmailed by Trump in their phone call on 25 July and did not know US military aid had been delayed at the time.\n\nA White House summary of the call showed Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate business dealings by the family of his political rival Joe Biden in Ukraine, as well as claims the former vice-president had a Ukrainian prosecutor fired for looking into a company where his son worked. No evidence has shown Biden was motivated by his son\u2019s work.\n\nQ&A What is the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower scandal? Show Hide On 25 July, US president Donald Trump called Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During the course of the call he reportedly asked the Ukrainian leader eight times to investigate former US vice-president Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. It is additionally reported that Trump ordered his staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine days before the call took place. Biden is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination and take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Trump confirmed he discussed the Bidens with Zelenskiy, and accused the pair \u2013 without offering any evidence \u2013 of corruption. A US intelligence community whistleblower filed a report after becoming alarmed at Trump\u2019s behaviour in the matter. The White House refused to release the substance of the whistleblower complaint, setting up a confrontation with Congress over the release of information. Complaints of this nature are usually reported to Congress within seven days. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, has admitted asking the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens. It is illegal for a political campaign to accept a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. Democrats say an investigation into a political opponent \u2013 for which Trump appears to have been pushing \u2013 would amount to a thing of value.\n\nZelenskiy said he was ready to investigate Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 US elections if served with an official request by the US. He also said he knew he had needed to secure a meeting with Trump, saying US relations with Ukraine were \u201ctired\u201d and the Americans \u201cwanted to know where their money had gone\u201d.\n\nBut Zelenskiy\u2019s main message to the US was: leave us out of it.\n\n\u201cChoose your own president yourself,\u201d Zelenskiy told American reporters in an attempt to stake neutral ground in a Democratic impeachment inquiry. \u201cAnd if possible, we ask you not to influence elections in a free Ukraine.\u201d\n\nDown below, journalists ate lunch at stalls with names such as Bali Bowl and Milk Bar as protesters and petitioners occasionally shouted up to Zelenskiy. One, the mother of a Ukrainian lawyer stabbed to death in 2015, demanded a proper investigation into the murder, and justice for her daughter.\n\nOver the hours of questioning, Zelenskiy dodged queries about his relationship with the billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky, and called ending the war with Russian-backed separatists in south-east Ukraine the most important goal of his presidency.\n\nThe spectacle recalled a hallmark of another politician: Vladimir Putin\u2019s marathon press conferences and Q&A sessions, controlled but flashy affairs primarily designed to show the Russian president\u2019s transparency without putting him in danger of embarrassing himself.\n\nSecond whistleblower comes forward in Trump-Ukraine scandal Read more\n\nZelenskiy also said he would have to meet Putin face to face to end the war, which would be deeply controversial in political circles in Kyiv.\n\n\u201cNo one talks about the meeting in person because everyone is against it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the meeting must be held if we want the war to end.\u201d No date had been discussed, Zelenskiy added.\n\nThe event was a tacit rebuttal to journalists who have complained Zelenskiy\u2019s administration has been opaque, and have accused his press secretary of bodychecking or physically pulling them away from the president.\n\nBut the effect was not always convincing. In an early round of questioning, Zelenskiy turned on a reporter for the Kyiv magazine Novoye Vremya, asking why a key investor was from the Czech Republic and not a Ukrainian citizen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that the mass media should be independent and Ukrainian,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his remarks. The reporter later shot back: \u201cI think it\u2019s better that media is owned by an EU citizen than corrupt oligarchs.\u201d", "description": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy is questioned by journalists on topics including his phone call with Donald Trump", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59550defc8157d3c5682e67dd8b193001b8aac7f/0_11_3284_1971/master/3284.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a623bff6d9602b475b6f9423e2fbf67", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
