They came up to my room to make sure I was fine.\u2019\n\nThe ambulance crew reportedly arrived to his home in South Woodford, North East London, shortly before 1pm with the police arriving soon after.\n\nHealth: According to The Sun , police 'broke into' the TOWIE star's home after he failed to return his friends' phone calls (pictured with Gemma in October 2018)\n\nWhen the cops got inside, they assessed Arg but then got a second call at 4:20pm before a third ambulance arrived.\n\nArg said his parents were already in his home checking up on him when 'this person' called the emergency services again.\n\nAfter the ambulance arrived at his house after 4pm, Arg said he had a quick chat with them on his doorstep, adding the police and paramedics were only at his house for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe reality star added that he was 'slightly embarassed' by the incident and apologised for any wasted police time as he was 'absolutely fine'.\n\nA source had told The Sun: 'James\u2019 friends are beyond worried. Their concern is that if this behaviour keeps on happening that one day soon they will go around to find him dead.\n\n'He has become more and more reclusive and his loved ones are worried about what is going on behind closed doors, away from watchful eyes.\n\n'It took the quick thinking of police to smash through the glass panel on his front door to undo the bolt and get in. Arg needs a wake-up call and hopefully this will be it.'\n\nThe source added that Gemma called the emergency services after hearing from Arg's parents and immediately thought the worst.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said in a statement: \u2018Police were called at 13.11hrs to a residential address following concerns for the welfare of male occupant.\n\nPost: The scare comes the same weekend Arg posted this snap to his Instagram promoting a range of cleaning products from his home\n\n'Officers attended with LAS (London Ambulance Service). The male, in his 30s, was spoken to. He was left in the company of family. Officers were called at 16.21hrs to the same address, again due to concerns for the same male\u2019s welfare. The male declined assistance.\u2019\n\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for James and Gemma for further comment.\n\nThe scare came the same weekend Arg posted a snap to his Instagram promoting a range of cleaning products from his home and also said that he has a DJ'ing gig in Marbella coming up next Wednesday.\n\n'Finally moved into my beautiful new home. Thank you so much @nenucoattrendytots for your lovely house warming gifts!\n\n'The smells remind me of Spain which help me not to miss it as much lol \u2764\ufe0f I can\u2019t wait to be back in Majorca this Wednesday for my gig at @stadium63'.\n\nArg was said to have been sacked from TOWIE after failing a routine drug test, leaving his friends worried about his health.\n\nA source told The Sun that Arg voluntarily agreed to the routine test before he returned to filming because of concerns over his previous issues with drugs and alcohol.\n\nThe source added: 'He has become more and more reclusive and his loved ones are worried about what is going on behind closed doors, away from watchful eyes' (pictured in May 2019)\n\nThe insider added that the production crew of TOWIE are very fond of him and hope he can overcome his issues.\n\nDuring a previous appearance on This Morning, James spoke about his weight, saying he believes he replaces substance abuse with food.\n\nHe said: 'I'm proud at myself I've been able to do really well career wise in the last nine months, I\u2019ve stayed sober but instead of me going out with mates doing drugs... I\u2019m probably acting out on food.'\n\nIn August last year, Arg returned to rehab following a split from Gemma in a brave bid to tackle his demons.\n\nThe TV star spent three months in a facility in Thailand over the festive season in 2016 in a bid to curb his wild ways and revealed that he checked himself in to a programme in order to get the 'ongoing support' he needed.\n\nHe also spent time in The Priory for alleged drink and drug issues in 2014.", "description": "Gemma Collins took to Instagram on Sunday evening for the first time since she reportedly called 999 over fears her on/off boyfriend James 'Arg' Argent had overdosed.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock", "Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19970794-0-image-a-100_1571615875351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
