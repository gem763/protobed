I try to stay off it as much as I can, although it is useful for news. It is one of those debates at the minute with the amount of abuse directed at players, whether it is really worth being on it, especially when you are in a hard-fought season. It is tough going.\u201d\n\nIn respect of Christie, Reid \u2013 who attended the game at Livingston with Steve Clarke, the Scotland manager \u2013 said: \u201cWe spoke briefly last night and obviously Ryan is flat after the result and the red card.\n\n\u201cI have been there myself \u2013 been sent off many times \u2013 so I have that ability to relate to that, but in a strange way he will be wanting to get back on the pitch as soon as possible, not to make up for it but to show what he can do, get rid of that disappointment and put in a couple of decent performances if he gets the opportunity.\u201d\n\nChristie has received vile abuse via social media after receiving the red card Credit: PA\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother squad member who has found himself at the heart of debate, both online and in the conventional media, is Lawrence Shankland of Dundee United, who has enjoyed a productive start to the season with 13 club goals. The question of his suitability, as a player operating in the Scottish Championship, has animated pundits such as Kris Boyd, the former Rangers and Kilmarnock striker, who stated that Shankland\u2019s inclusion in the squad is a symptom of the lack of top-class quality in attack.\n\n\u201cYeah, I see people\u2019s point of view that it\u2019s the second tier of Scottish football, but John McGinn has done it before and it can happen. Hopefully I can replicate that,\u201d Shankland said.\n\nOf Boyd\u2019s critique, the 24-year-old said: \u201cI\u2019ve been avoiding it but people are always going to have their opinion. They are entitled to it. That\u2019s the environment we\u2019re in. If players of that calibre are taking notice of you, it\u2019s good and you can take the advice if it\u2019s given.\n\n\u201cIt was good to be part of it with the squad and see the players and what level they are at. Everybody has been brand new with me and making me welcome. I saw him, the manager, last night and he just said, \u2018Relax and enjoy yourself.\u2019 That was good to hear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just hard work, putting the effort in at training and away from it, making sure everything in your life is right to make sure you are giving yourself the best opportunity on game day. I maybe wasn\u2019t doing that before but as soon as I fixed that, things seemed to come together.\n\n\u201cThe proof is there that you can get a call-up no matter what level of football you are playing at. If it inspires people, then I\u2019ll be glad to be that person they are looking at.\u201d", "description": "Ryan Christie\u2019s contribution to the Scotland squad for the Euro 2020 qualifying double-header away to Russia and at home to San Marino will not be affected by the deluge of vile abuse which forced the Celtic midfielder to close his Twitter account having been sent off during Sunday\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Livingston", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gFNBNQyBitxryWK8cPZW0Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZbQe_4LOAh5nSIO_EIDGvQ--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/fe0c76ed45e0e6746d1b8f488ce95281", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
