The Index turned southwards after touching 11400 in the morning.\n\nAfter a huge short covering on announcement of reduced corporate tax there has been rising expectation of a new high in the market and traders turned positive, but the short lived rally gave a good correction of over 500 points in the next 8 trading days. It must be understood that slashing corporate taxes are definitely good for long run but there are some burning issues in Indian Economy which needs to be addressed wisely by Government.\n\nTechnically, more weakness shall prevail in the market with rising tensions of lack of demand in Auto and Reality sector. The crude and gold rates are adding fuel to the fire and trade war tensions between USA and China is definitely spoiling party for Bulls globally. The slowdown is prevailing in many developed nations as well which will impact the economies and trades between the countries.\n\nOn closing below 11133, Nifty can still drag down till 11089 - 11050 - 11011 - 10954 in the coming days indicating market turning to be sell on rise again despite of Government measures to bring liquidity to market. 11310 and 11401 levels shall now work as a resistance for some time now. Unless Nifty crosses and closes above the said levels on weekly basis we cannot expect strong rally further.\n\nFACTORS THAT WILL DRICE THE MARKET IN COMING DAYS 1. The earning season is about to begin and Nifty Majors shall start to announce its Q2 earnings from the 2nd week of October. Traders and investors must be very selective on buying. The overall earnings are expected to be muted or on a lower side against the earnings in previous year.\n\n2. The RBI has already given a rate cut of 0.25 basis points but along with it RBI has also reduced forecast on India's GDP growth from 6.90% to 6.10% for FY 2020.\n\n3. FPI has been net sellers continuously in the Indian Markets on lack of positive sentiments and economy facing lack of domestic demand. From 1st to 4th Oct FPIs have pulled out 3000 crores from Indian Market.\n\n4. The Diwali festive season will start later in October and the Auto Industry which is facing demand slowdown due to high GST rates and liquidity issues will be in focus.\n\n5. There is no full-stop yet on the US-China Trade war, which keeps bulls under check and any positive developments between the two giants can be a real booster for world economies.\n\n6. The Nifty PSU Index is trading near to its 3 year lows and PSU Bank shares are facing selling pressure which is a sign of worry for Indian Markets as well as Banking Sector.\n\nIt is advisable for traders and Investors to trade with discipline and financial wisdom in the market. Stock selection will be very crucial in such kind of volatile market.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Kushal Lakhani covering: .
