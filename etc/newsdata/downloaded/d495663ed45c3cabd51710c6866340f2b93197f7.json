Add Miley Cyrus as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Miley Cyrus news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cI\u2019m four months sober,\u201d the 26-year-old revealed in a now-deleted Instagram live video. \u201cIt\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever felt. I\u2019m radiating.\u201d\n\nCyrus said her announcement was cut short because her phone died, so the video wasn't saved. To make up for it she posted another Instagram live video, this time on a split-screen with her boyfriend Cody Simpson. The two tried on various filters and traded playful jabs between interacting with fans in the chat.\n\nA fan even asked the couple about when they first kissed.\n\n\"You were a cougar, though,\" the 22-year-old Australian singer joked, \"still are.\"\n\n\"Cougar and cub, baby,\" Cyrus retorted with a smile.\n\nIn August, Cyrus came clean about her past drug use in a candid Twitter thread.\n\n\"It is no secret that I was into partying in my teens and early 20's. I have not only smoked, but advocated for weed, I\u2019ve experimented with drugs, my biggest song to date is about dancing on molly and snorting lines in the bathroom,\" she tweeted in response to rumors that she cheated on her ex-husband Liam Hemsworth.\n\nWhile Cyrus' newfound sobriety coincides with her split with Hemsworth, her healthier lifestyle might have been influenced by Cody.\n\nLast Tuesday, Simpson's manager, Matt Zeidman, told People that \"they\u2019re both sober now and are focused on health, work and spending time together. Seems pretty ideal to me.\u201d", "description": "Miley Cyrus announces she's four months sober and opens up about boyfriend Cody Simpson on Instagram.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/miley-gty-er-191021_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
