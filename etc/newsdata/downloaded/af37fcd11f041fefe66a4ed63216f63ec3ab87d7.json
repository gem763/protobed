Photos: Kenneth Chan\n\nJohn Size says fans can expect to see gun four-year-old Champion\u2019s Way back at the races within weeks, while the master trainer has also confirmed he hopes to have five runners in the Group Two Jockey Club Sprint (1,200m) on November 17.\n\nChampion\u2019s Way moved nicely through his gears on the way to winning a 1,200m trial on the all-weather track at Sha Tin on Tuesday morning and Size is looking forward to seeing what the gelding can produce in his second season.\n\n\u201cHe looks like a good horse, hopefully he can go on with it,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s any better [than last season] but he seems normal.\u201d\n\nIt's rare for a three-year-old to win a Group race in Hong Kong...

He\u2019ll run in November because there\u2019s nothing for him in December.\u201d\n\nSize says his legion of top-line sprinters are all healthy as he plots a path to December\u2019s Group One Hong Kong Sprint (1,200m), with five of his six highest-rated gallopers on track to run in the final lead-up race.\n\nBeat The Clock, D B Pin, Hot King Prawn, Ivictory and Full Of Beauty are all likely to appear in the Jockey Club Sprint.\n\n\u201cThey all look normal, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything amiss with them so they should be fine to race and it\u2019s just a matter of what their race form is like, but at home they\u2019re good,\u201d Size said.\n\nDual Group One winner Beat The Clock has had two trials and Size is hopeful he can run up to the level of his huge 2018-19 campaign.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a year older so he might, or he might not, but his trackwork, his health and what he\u2019s doing at home, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any changes,\u201d he said.\n\nJockey Club Sprint defending champion Hot King Prawn (colic) and Group One winner D B Pin (tendon) are on the comeback from injury and trialled nicely last week.\n\nWhile Size is happy with them, he reserved judgment on whether they can replicate past feats until he has seen them under race pressure: \u201cThat\u2019s what the races are for, they\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d\n\nSeasons Bloom flashes home to give Grant van Niekerk and Danny Shum the G2 Premier Bowl! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/AvtwvEXfyl \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\nUp-and-comer Full Of Beauty has run twice already this season, winning the Group Three National Day Cup (1,000m) and coming second in the Group Two Premier Bowl (1,200m), while Ivictory was last in the Premier Bowl on his return from a 10-month lay-off.\n\n\u201cHe looked disappointing but I think you have to be a little bit forgiving of what he does in his first couple of starts because he hasn\u2019t raced in so long,\u201d Size said.\n\nJoao Moreira is the incumbent jockey for Full Of Beauty, Beat The Clock and Hot King Prawn, with Size indicating the Brazilian is most likely to stick with proven top-level performer Beat The Clock.", "description": "John Size says fans can expect to see gun four-year-old Champion\u2019s Way back at the races within weeks, while the master trainer has also confirmed he hopes to have five runners in the Group Two Jockey Club Sprint (1,200m) on November 17....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/29/73d4088e-fa0e-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15_image_hires_153714.JPG?itok=6Lh0XFvN&v=1572334642", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
