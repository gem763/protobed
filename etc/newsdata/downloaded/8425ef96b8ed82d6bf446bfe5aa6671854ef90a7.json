He has started talking to PETA about dog care and will meet Thursday with the group\u2019s executive vice president Tracy Reiman in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming in with open ears and eyes, to have an objective conversation about animal welfare,\u201d Urbach said Tuesday. \u201cIf there\u2019s something we can learn from their organization, I\u2019m willing to listen.\u201d\n\nReiman plans to talk about the differences between \u201cthe needs and behavior of dogs and those of humans,\u201d she said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nShe said it will be the third time she has talked with Urbach. The Thursday meeting will be the first in person, after Urbach asked to meet.\n\nReiman noted that as a former CEO of USA Triathlon, Urbach knows endurance sports but not when applied to dogs.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t extrapolate from human experiences in endurance racing and apply the result to dogs who are driven past their limits,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Thursday summit, as Urbach calls it, comes after a difficult time for the Iditarod that was marked in recent years by escalating pressure from animal activists over multiple dog deaths, a 2017 dog-doping scandal and the loss of big-name sponsors.\n\nUrbach said the Iditarod and PETA both care about animal welfare, and he hopes the two can find common ground through education about the race and treatment of the dogs.\n\nHowever, he said PETA has long spread \u201cgrossly inaccurate and inflammatory\u201d information about the Iditarod, saying it ruins dogs that don\u2019t die on the trail; dogs are kept outdoors in freezing temperatures; and ones that can\u2019t make the grade are killed.\n\nPlenty of dogs have run the race multiple times with no harm, Urbach said, noting that Iditarod dogs are outdoor animals that train daily and are at their prime in sub-zero weather.\n\n\u201cThere might have been some culling years ago, but that\u2019s not part of the Iditarod\u2019s culture going forward,\u201d Urbach said.\n\nReiman said human athletes aren\u2019t chained outside in freezing weather and they get proper nutrition and hydration. Her group has documented that Iditarod dogs are \u201cfed rotten slop\u201d and frozen water, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not opposed to a thousand-mile race, but the true test of endurance is when humans do it under their own power \u2014 as some have \u2014 and leave dogs out of it,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBy PETA\u2019s count, more than 150 dogs have died in the race, including one this year. Five dogs connected with the 2017 race also died.\n\nRace officials dispute the total number of deaths and say no records on the subject were kept in the Iditarod\u2019s early years.", "description": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 The new head of Alaska\u2019s Iditarod plans to meet with a leader of an animal welfare group that\u2019s devoted to ending", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Marc-Lester_Anchorage-Daily-News-via-AP-File-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
