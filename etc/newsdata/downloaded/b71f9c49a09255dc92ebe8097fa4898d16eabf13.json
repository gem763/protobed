Ocasek was 75.\n\nHis estranged wife, supermodel Paulina Porizkova, found him unresponsive Sunday afternoon at his home in Manhattan's Gramercy Park neighborhood, sources told the New York Post, adding that he apparently died of natural causes.

I always liked great songs, and it didn\u2019t matter if it was from the Carpenters or Lou Reed. As long as they were done well and they weren\u2019t corny or fake.\"\n\nCOMPLETE COVERAGE OF STARS WE'VE LOST IN 2019\n\nThe band broke up in the late-'80s, as Ocasek embarked on a solo career.

It is a lifetime. I had three families during that time. They are like lives that go by and millions of people and things and artists and writers and business people and fans. \u2026 It\u2019s a lot of stuff. It\u2019s been a pretty eventful life, I can say.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Ric Ocasek, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame singer whose popular new-wave band, The Cars, helped define the sound of rock music in the late 1970s and '80s, was found dead in his New York City apartment on Sunday, a police spokesman told Fox News.
