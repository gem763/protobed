People expressed \u201cprejudiced\u201d views about Australia\u2019s climate policy, he said \u2013 \u201cNow where do they get their information from? Who knows, maybe they read it.\u201d\n\nGreta Thunberg's 495-word UN speech points us to a future of hope \u2013 or despair Read more\n\nAsked whether Australia intended to update its emissions reduction commitments as required by the Paris agreement\u2019s five-yearly review process, Morrison suggested that Australia\u2019s 2030 target was fixed: \u201cWe are keeping to the commitments we have set and do you know why? That\u2019s what I put to the Australian people.\u201d\n\nThe Paris global climate accord includes a five-yearly global stocktake to assess collective progress, and Morrison\u2019s signal in the US appears at odds with advice this year from Australian officials who restated a commitment to \u201creview and refine\u201d domestic commitments when the EU and China questioned Australia\u2019s policies.\n\nAsked whether he would keep a commitment Australia made at the Pacific Islands Forum to develop a 2050 climate policy by next year, Morrison said: \u201cWe will assess that as we said we would do, but my priority is meeting 2020 and 2030. We will look at the broader context but, honestly, our focus is on meeting those commitments.\u201d\n\nThe forum\u2019s communique says all parties to the Paris agreement will \u201cformulate and communicate mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies by 2020\u201d.\n\nWith Morrison facing criticism for failing to attend Monday\u2019s climate action summit at the UN, and with attendees at the UN general assembly reporting that Australia is getting some negative blowback because of climate change \u2013 the prime minister sought to use his first address to the UN as leader to project a more positive message about his country\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cAustralia is taking real action on climate change and getting results,\u201d he told world leaders. \u201cWe are successfully balancing our global responsibilities with sensible and practical policies to secure our environmental and economic future.\n\nMorrison responds to Greta Thunberg by warning children against 'needless' climate anxiety Read more\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s internal and global critics on climate change willingly overlook or ignore our achievements, as the facts simply don\u2019t fit the narrative they wish to project about our contribution. Australia is responsible for just 1.3% of global emissions. Australia is doing our bit on climate change and we reject any suggestion to the contrary.\u201d\n\nMorrison said few countries in the OECD could report to the general assembly that they had overachieved on their Kyoto commitments. He didn\u2019t mention Australia was given special treatment in the Kyoto process \u2013 it was permitted to include carbon emissions from land clearing.\n\nHe said emissions per person and the economy\u2019s emissions intensity were at their lowest levels in 29 years. He did not tell the general assembly that emissions across the economy are rising in Australia, and have risen every year since the Coalition abolished the carbon price.\n\nEmissions in the electricity sector had fallen, he said: \u201cIn the year to March 2019, emissions from Australia\u2019s electricity sector were 15.7% lower than the peak recorded in the year to June 2009.\u201d But he did not mention that emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising, driven predominantly by an increase in liquefied natural gas production in Western Australia, and transport.\n\nMorrison also noted that while Australia was a \u201cresource-rich country, it is important to note that Australia only accounts for around 5.5% of the world\u2019s coal production\u201d.\n\nAfter the Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg used an appearance at the UN this week to excoriate the lack of action by world leaders, Morrison returned serve in the same venue. Australia\u2019s prime minister said his view was that children had \u201ca right not just to their future but to their optimism\u201d.\n\nHe told the general assembly he received \u201cmany letters from children in Australia concerned about their future\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe should let our kids be kids \u2013 teenagers be teenagers \u2013 while we work positively together to deliver practical solutions for them and their future,\u201d he said.\n\nMorrison said Australia was committed \u201cto leading urgent action to combat plastic pollution choking our oceans; tackle overexploitation of our fisheries, prevent ocean habitat destruction and take action on climate change\u201d.\n\nHe said Australia was determined to create a \u201ccircular plastics economy\u201d.\n\n\u201cRecently, I announced that Australia will ban exports of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres, starting in 2020. That\u2019s about 1.4m tonnes of potent recyclable material.\n\n\u201cAustralia is also leading on practical research and development into recycling \u2013 turning recycled plastic and glass waste into roads, manufacturing 100% recycled PET bottles and capturing methane and waste to create energy.\n\n\u201cNew technologies are coming on line with the potential to recycle used plastics into valuable new plastics \u2013 creating a circular plastics economy.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\nHe said Australia would invest $167m in a domestic recycling plan and create the right investment environment so that new technologies were commercialised, \u201cpreventing pollution entering our oceans, and creating valuable new products\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister also restated that Australia would be investing in climate actions through the aid budget in its region rather than through the UN climate fund.\n\nHe rejected a view expressed this week by the UN\u2019s chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who warned the 74th general assembly that the world faced a \u201cgreat fracture\u201d, with the countries at risk of cleaving between the US and China.\n\nAustralia would resist the path of \u201cbinary choices\u201d, Morrison said.\n\n\u201cApproaching its 75th anniversary next year, the UN must reform and evolve to respond effectively to the challenges of the 21st century, and to fulfil its core mandate, the UN must be ever mindful of the principles and values that have always been foundational to the UN\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\nHe said the UN was founded on liberal democratic principles: \u201cWe believe they should remain the guiding principles for the UN into the future.\u201d", "description": "PM trumpets his country\u2019s achievements in address to UN general assembly", "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59bbbcd9edeca724fe35c3d96cdd7d1f8b33ef8/0_140_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b5ba8eb0ff2f7ce8b6fe498543b8a1c6", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
