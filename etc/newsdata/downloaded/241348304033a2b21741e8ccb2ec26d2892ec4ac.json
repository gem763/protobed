Currently, 48% of U.S. adults are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d worried, compared with 39% in 2017 after one gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas and 38% in 2015 after a San Bernardino shooter left 14 dead.\n\nThe most recent poll was conducted August 15-30, less than two weeks after back-to-back shootings in a 13-hour period \u2014 9 people were killed in Dayton, Ohio and 22 were killed in a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas. The 2015 and 2017 polls were conducted in the immediate aftermath of the shootings; the latest readings may have been even higher had the poll happened closer to the shootings.", "description": "", "authors": ["News.Gallup.Com Poll Nearly-Half-Fear-Victim-Mass-Shooting.Aspx"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
