The thing is I have obligation to use the least intrusive tool in order to restore fair competition,\" she told lawmakers in a packed chamber.\n\n\"Since it is quite a thing to break up a company, obviously I have an obligation to try what else can be a good tool to solve the situation that we are in,\" she said.\n\nMs Vestager has in the past years handed out hefty fines as well as ordered companies to change their business practices.\n\nShe is expected to order US chipmaker Broadcom to suspend some business practices until she completes her investigation into potential anti-competitive business practices, according to a source.\n\nAt the hearing, she said such interim measures had benefits.\n\n\"We find it a high priority to speed up what we do,\" she said.\n\nAn interim measure against Broadcom expected in the coming weeks would be the European Commission's first in almost two decades. It bans certain activities until the regulator completes its years-long investigations and could pave the way for similar action against other tech companies.\n\nMs Vestager also dismissed concerns of conflicts between her enforcer and new regulatory role, saying Commission decisions were taken jointly by commissioners and reinforced by independent advice from the EU executive's lawyers and economists.\n\nThe Commission as a whole requires EU lawmakers' approval before taking office in November.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BRUSSELS] Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday she preferred to use fines or other penalties on rule-busting companies rather than break them up, saying this approach would be less disruptive to the companies and the market. .
