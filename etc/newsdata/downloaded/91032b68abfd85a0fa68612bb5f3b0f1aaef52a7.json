He can mine diamonds and turn them into tools, including helmets, armour, leggings, boots, and swords. Such equipment wouldn\u2019t break easily, and the diamond sword is very powerful. If I was attacked by some bad guys, Steve could help me defeat them. I would be safe under his protection.\n\nJenny Fung, 13, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nA slice of luck\n\nI would pick Genji from Overwatch. Come on, who doesn\u2019t love Genji? If he was my bodyguard, bullets, rockets, or anything would be useless because he could deflect them all. If the bad guys wanted to fight, good luck to them. Genji is a cyborg ninja. He\u2019s good at close-combat or long-range battles thanks to his shurikens. He can also run at the speed of sound! His dragon blade would slice through anyone.\n\nAnderson Li, 14, Island School\n\nWhat celebrity wardrobe would you love to raid?\n\nPikachu is my pal\n\nI would pick Pikachu. It\u2019s so cute, the enemies would think it\u2019s weak even though it isn\u2019t. What\u2019s more, Pikachu is so loyal that it won\u2019t leave you when you\u2019re in trouble; instead it would be there for you till the end.\n\nJasmine Cho Li, 14, Cheung Chuk Shan College\n\nRiding high\n\nI would summon my favourite Pokemon, Charizard, who could protect me from all kinds of dangers. What\u2019s more, I could take a ride on Charizard whenever I wanted!\n\nNester Chik, 17, Sing Yin Secondary School\n\nLeon is my pick\n\nMy pick would have to be Leon Kennedy from the Resident Evil series. Leon started his first day as a cop in Raccoon City by saving the city from a zombie invasion. His achievements also include saving the president\u2019s daughter from a mean group of people. His marksmanship and adaptability makes him a reliable bodyguard to protect me from any kind of danger.\n\nBernard Cheung Chi-wai, 18, Macau Anglican College\n\nIf you had a robot for the entire day, what would you ask it to do?\n\nA double boost\n\nKirby. He\u2019s cute and lovable so it would be really fun to have him around. However, despite his gentle appearance, Kirby is great at both fighting and defending. It would be great to have him as a bodyguard because I would have a cheerful friend and fierce protector all in one!\n\nOlivia Tan, 17, Hong Kong International School\n\nA heroic figure\n\nI would definitely pick Dr Gordon Freeman in the video game, Half-life. He is very good looking and I love him very much! Also, he graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US and is a Doctor of Philosophy! I want him to tell me things about philosophy. I am very interested in philosophy.\n\nMelody Ma, 13, Carmel Pak U Secondary School\n\nPink power\n\nI would hire Kirby to be my personal bodyguard. When I was a kid, I remember choosing Kirby as my character in Wii. It\u2019s not only because Kirby was pink but because he can swallow creatures and objects and gain their abilities. Kirby\u2019s skills would come in super-handy any time, whether at home or school. For example, if I were late for school, Kirby could inhale the things that are blocking my path to get me to where I need to be quickly. If he inhaled a car, he would be able to drive me home after school!\n\nYoonjung Choi, 14, Hong Kong International School\n\nWhich Disney villain would make the best roommate?\n\nMan of steel\n\nIt would have to be Iron Man. Iron Man is very strong, making him the perfect person to handle threats against me. But most of the time, not much would happen \u2013 after all, I\u2019m not a super villain or a criminal boss. I think Iron Man would be a fun guy to talk to, no matter the topic, because he\u2019s so clever and has an opinion on almost everything. He might even come up with some great dad jokes!\n\nCyrus Chu, 16, St Louis School\n\nSneak attack\n\nEvie Frye from Assassin\u2019s Creed. She is an expert at sneaking up on enemies, fighting, climbing buildings, and parkouring (running through areas in a town, jumping over walls and other objects). What sets her apart is her ability to strategise and think critically when facing problems, as well as her commitment to what she believes in.\n\nCheang Kai U, 17, Macau Anglian College\n\nEdited by M.
