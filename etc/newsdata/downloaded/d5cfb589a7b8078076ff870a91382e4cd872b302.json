When he arrived in the Polish capital, the first thing he saw was a woman selling bread at Central Station, right under a poster threatening death for doing so.\n\nIn his memoir, One Chance in a Thousand, he noted that while Ukrainians followed orders without questioning them, people in Warsaw seemed to ignore them. For him, this juxtaposition was an example of the city\u2019s amazing ability to hustle \u2013 that is, to get things done in half-legal or not completely honest ways. In fact, Polish people \u2013 and Varsovians \u00ad(residents of Warsaw) especially \u2013 are not so keen on rules and regulations, and the Polish language has several words to describe this trait.\n\nThe Warsaw hustler is known as the biggest hustler of them all\n\nCwaniak, which means \u201chustler\u201d, is a favourite way to refer to someone who is always trying to outsmart the system. There\u2019s also kombinowa\u0107 (to scheme or to plot); cwaniakowa\u0107 (which refers to someone being cunning); and za\u0142atwi\u0107 (which can be translated as \u201cgetting things done\u201d, usually by using connections, charm or illegal means).\n\nAnd although the ability to beat the system, to get things done, is held in high esteem throughout the country, as a 1963 Polish song by Stanis\u0142aw Grzesiuk says, the Warsaw hustler is known as the biggest hustler of them all.\n\nWhile this might seem like an odd accolade, it was once a celebrated \u2013 and necessary \u2013 trait.\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018cwaniak\u2019 used to have a positive meaning,\u201d explained Martyna Go\u017adziuk, a Warsaw guide and president of the Foundation Gwara Warszawska (Warsaw Dialect Foundation). \u201cIt was used to describe someone who can deal with life\u2019s challenges.\u201d\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The secrets hiding in Warsaw\n\n\u2022 Why Poland will never have hygge\n\n\u2022 What can Poland teach us about freedom?\n\nAnd given the city\u2019s tumultuous history, its inhabitants had to come up with ways to survive.\n\nIn 1944, the people of Warsaw started an uprising against the Nazis. While some claim that the Warsaw Uprising was doomed from the start, many see it as proof that Varsovians won\u2019t wait and see what happens but prefer to take matters into their own hands, whatever the consequences. Sadly, the uprising failed and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, many of them civilian. Yet the Warsaw Uprising is still commemorated every year on 1 August to honour the courage, spirit and sacrifice of the people who took part.\n\nBut even before the uprising, Warsaw (and Poland in general) had a strong resistance movement during World War Two. The Kotwica is the most famous symbol of the Warsaw Uprising; it\u2019s actually an amalgam of the letters P and W, which means \u201cPolska Walcz\u0105ca\u201d, or \u201cFighting Poland\u201d, and is still visible in numerous Warsaw buildings and streets. But there are many others, including the turtle, sometimes accompanied by the letters \u2018pPp\u2019 (\u201cpracuj Polaku powoli\u201d, literally meaning \u201cwork slowly, Pole\u201d), encouraging Polish people to ignore orders and sabotage Nazi companies and activities.\n\nDuring the war, Warsaw was extremely heavily bombed. To help visitors better imagine scale of the near-annihilation the city went through, Hanna Dzieli\u0144ska, another Warsaw guide, takes them to the Old Town and asks them to find 10 old houses. Then, she asks them to close their eyes. She tells them, \u201cWe\u2019re at war\u201d. And then, when they open their eyes, she explains that out of the 10 houses they picked, only one and a half are still standing.\n\nIt\u2019s a shocking statistic, and one that truly tested Warsaw\u2019s resilience. Many Varsovians were forced out of their city. Those who decided to return were also the most determined; they were willing to work hard to start their lives anew in a city that had been totally destroyed. \u201cWe can call them a hustler, someone sly and clever like a fox, or we can call them attached to their birthplace. It\u2019s all about the mindset,\u201d Dzieli\u0144ska said.\n\nThe destruction of Warsaw was so complete that the post-war authorities thought about moving the capital to another city, since re-building a town on this scale had never been done before. But the people of Poland, my grandfather among them, took matters in their own hands. There were hordes of people arriving in Warsaw, desperate to start anew, and when they arrived in the ruined city, they started rebuilding simply because they needed somewhere to live, despite the fact that the authorities were against it. The work became more organised, and eventually turned into a big push to rebuild the capital.\n\nIn 1945, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office was founded and took over the rebuilding of the city, using old city plans as well as 18th-Century paintings by Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto who then acted as court painter of the Polish king Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus Poniatowski. Residents literally rebuilt their city with their own hands, clearing debris and using bricks and stones from destroyed houses in Warsaw \u2013 and occasionally from other cities \u2013 to restore the city\u2019s Old Town to its former glory.\n\nMoreover, the idea to rebuild an entire city went against the architectural thought of the time. Other cities that were also destroyed by the war, in Italy, Germany or France, decided to rebuild only individual, most important buildings. But Warsaw went big. Now, Warsaw\u2019s Old Town is a Unesco World Heritage site.\n\nThe next generations of Varsovians are still reminded of the reconstruction effort as they go about their day around the Nowy \u015awiat, the city\u2019s most prominent street, where the words \u201cThe entire nation builds its capital\u201d are chiselled in big letters on one of the buildings.\n\nTo Dzieli\u0144ska, being a Warsaw hustler is mostly about contrariness. \u201cIf you destroy our city, we\u2019ll rebuild it and it will be twice as good as it was before. If a Varsovian doesn\u2019t like something, they\u2019re going to resist. They won\u2019t just agree to something,\u201d she said.\n\nThis contrariness was also visible in the Polish resistance against communist rule (1947 to 1989). While it was a time of censorship, food shortages and often arrests for the smallest of misdeeds, Poles reacted to their new, absurd reality with humour and flair, especially in Warsaw. Cabarets, such as Salon Niezale\u017cnych, flourished under the new regime, poking fun at politicians, censorship and the new regime in general. \u201cBeing a Warsaw hustler has to do with being smooth, confident and relaxed. It\u2019s about facing adversities in a way that\u2019s natural. We\u2019ll smile and we\u2019ll talk. We\u2019ll charm anyone,\u201d Dzieli\u0144ska added.\n\nCommunist rule was over by 1989, but the city\u2019s troubled history has left its marks on Warsaw that remain to this day.\n\nIt\u2019s about facing adversities in a way that\u2019s natural\n\nEven now, the Polish capital can be a challenging place to appreciate for tourists, who often describe it as sad and grey. But, as Dzieli\u0144ska points out, this is not fair. Because these traits are exactly what makes Warsaw stand out compared to its possibly prettier counterparts in Western Europe with less-turbulent histories.\n\n\u201cThere are cities where there\u2019s beauty wherever you look. And you don\u2019t have to work to appreciate those cities because the beauty takes care of everything. And then there are cities like Berlin, like Rotterdam, like Warsaw, where the soul of the city is not in richness and splendour. These cities are more challenging, more demanding,\u201d Dzieli\u0144ska said.\n\nAnd, as a proud Varsovian myself, I wholeheartedly agree.\n\nLuckily, Warsaw has been slowly but steadily shedding its dreary image. Dzieli\u0144ska says her clients are often pleasantly surprised by the clean, tree-lined streets and well-developed public transport system. And once the first negative impressions are broken, visitors are duly amazed. Many find it hard to believe that Warsaw\u2019s Old Town was rebuilt almost from scratch. But, of course, there is much more to see in Warsaw. From the beautiful \u0141azienki Park, which hosts the International Chopin Piano Competition, to museums such as the Warsaw Rising Museum or POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Warsaw is well worth a visit.\n\nAnd Varsovians themselves are learning to appreciate their unique city all over again. Recent art projects such as Projekt Warszawiak, a band that gives old Warsaw songs a modern twist, are wonderful examples of that. Most recently, their cover version of Grzesiuk\u2019s song, There is no Hustler Slicker than a Warsaw Hustler, has proven extremely popular.\n\nThe city has a lot to be proud of, and not just because it rose from the ashes after near-total destruction, followed by years of communist regime. \u201cAs a guide, you need to find a modus operandi that will make someone say about a city that\u2019s not objectively pretty, \u2018this city has been through a lot\u2019,\u201d Dzieli\u0144ska said.\n\nHer clients often ask her, with amazement, \u201cWhat do you mean this was all gone? You\u2019re heroes,\u201d she added.\n\nI like the idea of being a hero. But I think I prefer hustler.\n\nSoul of the City is a series from BBC Travel that invites you to uncover the unique characteristics of cities around the world through the stories of the people who live there.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
