Investigators found 15 guns, including seven rifles, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition at his basement apartment in Silver Spring, Maryland. He researched how to make homemade bombs and mortars, studied sniper training and used his government computer to search for information about Nazis and Adolf Hitler, prosecutors said\n\nWith his plea, the 50-year-old now faces up to 31 years in prison. His sentencing is set for 31 January.\n\nAfter the hearing, Hasson\u00b4s public defender issued a statement saying his case had been 'mischaracterized and sensationalized.'\n\nAssistant federal public defender Liz Oyer said Hasson 'was not plotting a terrorist attack or any of the abhorrent acts that the prosecution has repeatedly speculated about but never actually charged.'\n\nCoast Guard Lt. Christopher Hassan (pictured) plead guilty today to illegally stockpiling drugs and weapons. However, the 50-year-old avoided terrorism charges\n\nShe also said, 'Mr' Hasson never meant any harm to anyone. He deeply regrets the pain and embarrassment that he has caused his family and the US Coast Guard ...'\n\nTwo of the four counts in Hasson\u00b4s indictment charged him with illegally possessing unregistered and unserialized silencers. He also was charged with possession of a firearm by an unlawful user or addict of a controlled substance, and illegal possession of tramadol, an opioid painkiller.\n\nAssistant US Attorney Thomas Windom said prosecutors intend to argue that Hasson should be sentenced to the statutory maximum of 31 years in prison.\n\nOyer said she estimates that sentencing guidelines will call for a prison term ranging from 41 to 51 months.\n\nUS District Judge George Hazel is not bound by the guidelines when he sentences Hasson.\n\nHasson smiled at his wife, Shannon, when he entered the courtroom Thursday and saw her in the gallery.\n\nAn artist's impression shows Hasson on Friday in the courtroom. He drew up a target list of prominent liberal figures and planned to carry out an attack\n\nHasson's wife, Shannon, appeared in front of reporters outside the courthouse and told them that her husband was a 'loving man, an honorable man'\n\n'He\u00b4s a loving man, an honorable man, and I just hope that he comes home soon,' she told reporters as she left the courthouse.\n\nProsecutors claimed Hasson drew up what appeared to be a computer spreadsheet hit naming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.\n\nSeveral network TV journalists - MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN's Chris Cuomo and Van Jones - also were mentioned.\n\nCNN journalist Chris Cuomo (pictured left) and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (pictured right) were mentioned on a computer spreadsheet hit list drawn up by Hasson\n\nDemocrat presidential hopefuls California Senator Kamala Harris (pictured left) and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (pictured right) were also mentioned\n\nHasson also targeted two Supreme Court justices and two social media company executives and searched online for their home addresses in March 2018, within minutes of searching firearm sales websites, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn a February court filing, prosecutors said Hasson 'intends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.' They also said he has espoused extremist views for years and drafted an email in which he said he was 'dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth.'\n\nIn a 2017 letter he sent to himself as a draft and apparently wrote to a neo-Nazi leader, Hasson identified himself as a white nationalist for over 30 years and 'advocated for \"focused violence\" in order to establish a white homeland,' prosecutors said.\n\nInvestigators found 15 guns, including seven rifles, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition at Hasson's basement apartment in Silver Spring, Maryland. He researched how to make homemade bombs and mortars, studied sniper training and used his government computer to search for information about Nazis and Adolf Hitler, prosecutors said.\n\nIn a 2017 letter he sent to himself as a draft and apparently wrote to a neo-Nazi leader, Hasson identified himself as a white nationalist for over 30 years and 'advocated for \"focused violence\" in order to establish a white homeland'\n\nAlong with the firearms, the ex-Coast Guard ordered at least 4,650 tramadol pills from internet distributors between March 2016 and February 2019 and had them shipped to his homes in Maryland and Currituck, North Carolina\n\nProsecutors have said Hasson appeared to be planning attacks inspired by the manifesto of Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in a 2011 bomb-and-shooting rampage\n\nLast month, Hazel refused to dismiss the gun charges against Hasson, who has been in custody since his arrest. The judge rejected defense argument that charging Hasson with unlawful possession of firearm silencers violates his Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n\nProsecutors have said Hasson appeared to be planning attacks inspired by the manifesto of Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in a 2011 bomb-and-shooting rampage.\n\nOyer has said prosecutors found no evidence to back up terrorism allegations. She accused them of seeking to punish Hasson for 'private thoughts' he never shared.\n\nIn a court filing last week, Hasson\u00b4s lawyers asked the judge to bar prosecutors from presenting any trial evidence linking him to white nationalist views or associations or 'any plans or preparations he allegedly made to commit an act of violence or terrorism.'\n\nHasson, a former Marine, worked at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington on a program to acquire advanced new cutters for the agency. He has remained on active duty pending the outcome of the criminal case.\n\nHasson ordered at least 4,650 tramadol pills from internet distributors between March 2016 and February 2019 and had them shipped to his homes in Maryland and Currituck, North Carolina, according to Windom.\n\nThe prosecutor said Hasson consumed most of the pills, including at times when he was working at Coast Guard headquarters.\n\nInvestigators also seized hundreds of pills from his work desk, home and a backpack.", "description": "A US Coast Guard, who described himself as a white nationalist, has admitted to stockpiling weapons and planning to target judges, prominent Democrats and TV journalists.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19304986-0-image-a-36_1570204889332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
