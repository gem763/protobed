We\u2019re one or two players light,\u201d Solskjaer told Sky Sports. \u201cIf the right ones are available in January then we might do something. If not, these players will give everything (for a top four finish).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go down the route of bringing players in on big contracts and big fees if they\u2019re not the right ones for the whole group and for the future. The money is there to strengthen in January and in the summer.\u201d\n\nUnited started the season with a 4-0 win over Chelsea but have scored five goals in seven league matches since and Solskjaer said an injury to forward Anthony Martial, who has not played since August, was a factor in their struggles.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s many reasons, but one of them is injuries to Anthony,\u201d the 46-year-old former United player said. \u201cCreating chances has been a challenge for us with teams dropping deep.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re practising patterns every single week. When we get the players fit, I\u2019m going to make Marcus and Anthony score those scruffy goals, as that\u2019s what I did.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United will try to sign one or two players in the January transfer window to improve their chances of finishing in the top four but will not spend big on transfer fees and wages, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441813898&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0PJ", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
