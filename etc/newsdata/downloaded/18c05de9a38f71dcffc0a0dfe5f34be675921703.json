I have contributed approx. 16,000 (sixteen thousand) to 401k Roth and approx. 9,000 (nine thousand) to 401K before taxes so far. The cap for employee and company contributions (if over 50) is 62K to my knowledge.\n\nQuestion \u2013 Since IRS allows 25,000 contribution (age > 50) to 401K before taxes, Can I contribute additional remaining 25000- 9000 = 16,000 to 401K before taxes?\n\nAnd can I still contribute addition 21000 to 401 K Roth at work?\n\n62,000 \u2013 25000 (401k contribution before taxes, assuming I can add additional 16000 k) \u2013 16000 (already contributed to 401K Roth this year) = 21000.\n\nPlease ask if I am not clear.
