But with the explosion of the Trump-Ukraine revelations, he finds himself in the middle of a scandal that\u2019s really about the president\u2019s corruption \u2014 but which also makes him an easy target for the right, who claim that he and his son Hunter are the real villains in all this. Meanwhile, in a possibly related development, Elizabeth Warren is surging in Iowa and New Hampshire. Is this whole thing a curse for Biden?\n\nGabriel: There\u2019s definitely a lot going on here, but first let\u2019s note: Warren\u2019s upward trend has been going on for quite a long time. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s shot up in the polls as Trump has pushed his line on Biden\u2019s \u201cscandal\u201d \u2014 which, let\u2019s also be clear, there\u2019s still no evidence to support is a real one. All that said, it\u2019s hard to see how this is a net positive for Biden if it continues to be covered and thought about like it has been so far. His team has made a fairly persuasive case that Trump has been so focused on Biden, including in pushing this Ukraine theory, because he is most worried about him in a general election. That, of course, makes sense: Just look at the preliminary polling that shows Biden beating Trump consistently. This is great for Biden\u2019s central message of electability. However, a lot of the coverage \u2014 i.e., the way real voters are consuming this saga \u2014 has nonetheless put new scrutiny on Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, in a way that\u2019s hard for Biden to defend, even if the actual substance of Hunter\u2019s work wasn\u2019t illegal, and the specific accusations about Joe Biden, as vice-president, interfering in Ukrainian investigations is unfounded.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s instructive to look at how Biden himself is talking about all this. Here he is at a fundraiser in California yesterday: \u201cNow, I know that even though there\u2019s not been one single shred of evidence substantiating any accusation made, and today, the leading prosecutor, the headline in the Washington Post was, the prosecutor in, that they\u2019re trying to convince to say something differently, in, in Ukraine said there\u2019s nothing anybody in my family did wrong or at all. But folks, this isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s never been about me. It\u2019s a tactic that\u2019s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives, in your lives. Health care, education, the godawful rampant gun violence that\u2019s going on, and maybe the single most important consequential thing is climate change. So I\u2019m not going to let him do it. This is not about me, this is about the American people and the issues that matter to them.\u201d\n\nThis was after he recounted the actual big deal here: Trump\u2019s call, and the whistle-blower\u2019s report. So Biden clearly wants to talk about his own family \u2026 not at all.\n\nBen: Right. And he seemed a little bit tentative in his initial response to all this, which is a bit odd, considering the gravity and outrageousness of what the president was trying to do to him.\n\nGabriel: It\u2019s useful to think of it all in the context of Biden\u2019s whole career and political persona. He is very, very, very protective of his family, understandably, and simultaneously very invested in what he perceives to be his image as a straight shooter. So this is a double whammy.\n\nAgain, though, there\u2019s no evidence that the accusations are true. Can\u2019t stress that enough. So it\u2019s understandable that there are a lot of nerves in Democratic circles that analysts/pundits are talking around that fact and immediately jumping to: doesn\u2019t this look bad for Biden? I can\u2019t tell you how many Clinton \u201816 alums have made a complaint like that to me in recent days. Not complaining about Biden\u2019s actions, to be clear, but about how Trump has warped the public discussion around him to drag his opponent down.\n\nBen: So you\u2019re saying the allegations might be true? #democrathoax\n\nGabriel: You\u2019ll have to check the transcript memo.\n\nBen: Yes, it is crazy-making that we\u2019re all aware of the game Trump is playing, and then we have to do this kind of meta-questioning of whether it\u2019s working. I mean, I\u2019m doing that right now. But, as I was saying to our colleague Ed yesterday, logic and fairness and rationality isn\u2019t really the name of the game in politics, especially at the moment.\n\nGabriel: Well, I think it\u2019s not crazy to assert that Biden\u2019s entire pitch is based on the premise that you\u2019ll be proven wrong about that.\n\nBen: That rationality is making a comeback?\n\nGabriel: That reason will prevail.\n\nBen: It may, but there will still be a dangerously high level of silliness floating around.\n\nGabriel: All this said, I think there\u2019s a real question about how other Democratic candidates talk about this.\n\nThere\u2019s already been some obvious discomfort. Warren was asked if her VP\u2019s son could work abroad like Hunter Biden, and she initially said no, then said she had to check her plan to be sure. Castro has basically just defended Biden and refused to engage. No one has said \u201cthis is corrupt!\u201d or agreed with Trump, obviously, but they\u2019re proceeding with immense caution.\n\nBen: Yeah, it\u2019s a bit like the age issue. Pressing it too overtly is likely to backfire, as Castro recently learned.\n\nReporting indicates that Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats want to do this impeachment thing pretty quickly. Do you get the sense that the Biden camp is relieved about that fact? That by the time Iowa rolls around, the process might already be over?\n\nGabriel: It\u2019s very hard to tell, I think they\u2019re still trying to figure it out, just like everyone else. If you\u2019re a leading candidate, though, the prospect of an impeachment proceeding playing out during the primaries is a bit scary, since the politics of the impeachment are completely up in the air. It\u2019s just an unpredictable landscape. That said, obviously Biden\u2019s team doesn\u2019t want \u201cBiden,\u201d \u201ccorruption,\u201d \u201cUkraine,\u201d \u201cinvestigation\u201d to show up in context-free headlines for the next six months (even if the other words in the headline are \u201cTrump\u201d \u201cimpeach,\u201d etc.), but realistically the ongoing impeachment process is likely to move the national focus even further away from the narrow question of Hunter Biden\u2019s work, anyway. Republicans may continue to press on the Biden accusations, but that\u2019s likely the case, no matter how long the impeachment inquiry takes.\n\nBen: Biden hasn\u2019t been shy about going after Trump directly \u2014 his whole early strategy was to paint the president as a sui generis monster, which was in contrast to some of his rivals, who tended not to focus so much on the president (until they saw how well it was working for Biden). Could this episode work to his advantage in that it provides more evidence that Trump simply needs to be thrown out of office, and the one person who can do that is Joe?\n\nGabriel: That\u2019s what Biden is betting. Look at what his campaign manager said to Politico for a story this morning: \u201cWhy are you punching someone? Because you\u2019re afraid of them.\u201d The question is how Biden communicates that to voters without amplifying Trump\u2019s attacks. And, just as importantly, how other candidates counter it without feeding into Trump\u2019s line of argument.\n\nBen: To return to Warren: Perhaps the clearest sign yet of her threat to Biden is that his campaign is reportedly mulling a wealth tax, cribbing a page from her (and Bernie Sanders\u2019s) playbook. Does this strike you as a sound political strategy?\n\nGabriel: I mean, he\u2019s been saying over and over at private fundraisers, surrounded by rich people: Don\u2019t expect anything from me, I\u2019m not going to make your lives easier. So no one is going to start thinking of Biden as a crusader against the one percent, obviously, but it may soften some of the criticisms from the left, just a tiny bit. We don\u2019t know what this\u2019ll look like, yet, though. Reports just have his advisers \u201cconsidering\u201d the move. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s trying to win over the Bernie \u201816 crowd, just to prove he gets it. And FWIW I think the clearest sign of her threat to Biden is her beating him in polling.\n\nBen: Fair enough.\n\nGabriel: Going back to how Biden talks about all this, and everyone else responds, for a sec: We may have just gotten a very consequential development. CNN and the Times, who are co-hosting the next debate, just announced that it\u2019ll be one night only. And we know that there are almost certainly going to be 12 candidates onstage, which by definition means candidates will have less time than ever to actually talk, unless the debate is, like, four hours long. There\u2019s no way Trump\u2019s impeachment doesn\u2019t come up pretty prominently, obviously, so we\u2019ll see soon how candidates talk about Biden\u2019s side of this. What do you think would be an effective way for a long shot who needs Biden to falter to answer the question?\n\nBen: The questionee has become the questioner.\n\nWere I a long-shot candidate, I don\u2019t think my strategy would be to go after Biden directly on this issue. I don\u2019t think it would engender any sympathy from Democratic voters \u2014 and this is the sort of thing that\u2019s so thick in the air that it doesn\u2019t need explicating. But perhaps you could get away with some more subtle questioning of Biden\u2019s electability, which is his most powerful argument for the nomination. You could mention that Biden has a lot of baggage (which is true) without directly tying it to impeachment. What do you think?\n\nGabriel: You could try it, but the last three people to go after Biden in debates, however subtly or overtly, only got very momentary support, if any, out of doing it (Harris, Booker, Castro.) The most effective play in the eyes of voters might be to say exactly what Biden is saying: This is a distraction, and we can\u2019t afford to be distracted. That\u2019s saying something similar without actually saying it. But that\u2019s also admitting Trump has way more power to set the conversation than you probably want to admit.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss whether Joe Biden will sustain collateral damage from the possible impeachment of President Trump.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/27/27-joe-biden.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
