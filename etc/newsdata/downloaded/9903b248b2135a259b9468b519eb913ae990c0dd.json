A lot of us don\u2019t know what to make of it. It\u2019s something I\u2019m reading about like everybody is, but I\u2019m not gonna comment further.\u201d\n\nWednesday, when asked about the NBA\u2019s situation, Trump took the opportunity to go on a rant against Kerr (and to a lesser extent, San Antonio Spurs head coach Greg Popovich).\n\n\u201cI watch this guy Steve Kerr, and he was like a little boy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was so scared to be even answering the question. He couldn\u2019t answer the question, he was shaking. He didn\u2019t know how to answer the question. He\u2019ll talk about the United States very badly.\u201d\n\nKerr was asked about the response during media availability Thursday. He joked about considering riding a tricycle into the room (re: being a \u201clittle boy\u201d), and added that he was \u201cthe shiny object\u201d that occupied Trump Wednesday.\n\nHe went on to ruminate on his meetings with five previous presidents, one of which occurred shortly after his father was shot and killed in Beirut when he was president of the American University of Beirut. Kerr continued on to say he will not stop commenting on issues \u201cnear to his heart,\u201d like gun safety.\n\nStory continues\n\nSteve Kerr responds to Donald Trump mocking him yesterday: pic.twitter.com/UfagwyZKhc \u2014 Connor Letourneau (@Con_Chron) October 11, 2019\n\nWarriors head coach Steve Kerr says recent backlash won\u2019t stop him from speaking out on issues, like gun violence. pic.twitter.com/aMyNEVHCJn \u2014 Rusty Simmons (@Rusty_SFChron) October 11, 2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "After Trump criticized Kerr over electing not to comment on the NBA's developing situation with China, Kerr was relatively unfazed.", "authors": ["Torrey Hart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ei9A1NBY5lTE0dPA7uzgcg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04OTMuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RlFIniexzcpsYzLNbY2t0w--~B/aD0zNTEyO3c9NTAyOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/18555bd0-ebc6-11e9-bf76-c5db5719fbe1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
