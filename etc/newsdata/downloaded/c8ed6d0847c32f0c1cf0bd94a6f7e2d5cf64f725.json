REUTERS/Staff\n\nApple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) component suppliers AMS (AMS.S), STMicro (STM.PA) and Infineon (IFXGn.DE) posted some of the biggest gains on the European technology subsector .SX8P after strong pre-orders for the latest iteration of iPhone.\n\nTech stocks .SX8P rose 0.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index edged 0.1% higher.\n\nEarly market action remained tepid ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), where it is expected to reduce U.S. interest rates for the second time this year.\n\n\u201cAll eyes are going to be on the Fed. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see much between now and when the Fed gives its update,\u201d said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nThe Fed may cut rates to keep markets from selling off but might indicate that the reduction is \u201cmore of an adjustment rather than the beginning of a rate cutting cycle\u201d, Madden said.\n\nTraders are currently pricing in a 56.5% chance of a quarter of a percentage point cut, a far cry from a 92% chance just a week ago, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nEquity markets were mixed after the European Central Bank\u2019s move last week to cut rates deeper into negative territory and relaunch bond purchases with no scheduled end-date.\n\nEuropean stocks opened slightly lower on Wednesday, hurt by declines in Swiss luxury goods group Richemont (CFR.S) which fell 4% after UBS downgraded the luxury sector to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe luxury goods sector has been a key outperformer this year and looks overbought on technical indicators,\u201d UBS analysts said in a research note.\n\nAmong other decliners, DHL owner Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE) fell 2% following U.S. rival FedEx\u2019s (FDX.N) profit warning overnight citing the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nOther European mail delivery firms, DSV (DSV.CO), Kuehne & Nagel (KNIN.S), Royal Mail (RMG.L), PostNL (PTNL.AS), also declined.\n\nFrench utility EDF (EDF.PA) was the top gainer on STOXX 600, up 3.5%, after it said there was no need to close any of its nuclear reactors for now following the discovery of problems with weldings.", "description": "European shares steadied after early declines on Wednesday, as technology shares helped offset losses in luxury goods, while many investors remained on the sidelines ahead of an expected reduction in U.S. borrowing costs by the Federal Reserve.", "authors": ["Shreyashi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431139002&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0H6", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
