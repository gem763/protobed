A child cannot play,\" the girl\u2019s grandmother told ABC Chicago station WLS. \"Today is my baby's birthday, and for them to take her birthday from her, and she has a basketball game today she was looking forward to this.\"\n\nBlackful\u2019s grandfather, Dennis Hunt, told the station that he was standing outside on the porch when two people came up to him and opened fire. The two individuals had reportedly walked from one end of the block to the other before shooting.\n\nOne of the bullets then reportedly went through a window and struck Kentavia in the back of the head while she was sitting at the family computer, according to WLS.\n\nDerevyanny said she could not confirm where Kentavia had been shot because they hadn\u2019t yet received her body.\n\nKentavia lived at a home on the 15800 block of Paulina in Harvey, according to Derevyanny. The home where the shooting happened was also on that block but authorities would not confirm whether Kentavia was shot in her own home.\n\nHarvey police did not immediately respond to ABC News for comment, but told WLS that no one is in custody.\n\nFamily photo via WLS\n\nThe city's mayor, Christopher Clark, urged anyone who may have seen something to come forward.\n\n\"I find it hard to believe that a person walks down an entire block to get to the end of the block and ring out shots, and no one sees a thing,\" Clark told ABC News. \"We really need, in order to solve this heinous crime, we really need the communities active participation.\"\n\nHe said tragedies like this one \"shake us to the core.\"\n\n\"It affects the whole community but specifically your young people and your seniors because those young people and seniors, they're the ones that feel helpless,\" Clark said.\n\nThe superintendent of Harvey Public Schools District Number 152 identified the girl as a student at Brooks Middle School.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with her family and the greater Harvey School District 152 community,\" Superintendent John F. Thomas said in a statement on Tuesday, before the girl had died.", "description": "Kentavia Blackful was shot inside a home in Illinois and died on what would have been her 12th birthday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/kentavia-2-ht-er-190925_hpMain_v4x3_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
