Far-left leaders in Africa and around the world celebrated the \u201ccomrade\u201d despite his record of genocide, political repression, and mass starvation.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin was among the first to issue a statement following Mugabe\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cMany important dates in Zimbabwe\u2019s modern history are tied to the name of Robert Mugabe. He made a great personal contribution to the battle for your country\u2019s independence, to the building of Zimbabwean state institutions,\u201d Putin said, noting that Mugabe maintained \u201cfriendly relations\u201d with Putin.\n\nMugabe led a bloody revolution against the white then-Prime Minister Ian Smith of Rhodesia, the nation that would become Zimbabwe, garnering support by branding himself a liberator of Africans suffering under an anachronistic British leftover political system. Mugabe earned praise before embarking on the Gukurahundi genocide of 1983, designed to eliminate resistance to Mugabe and his Shona tribe from the Ndebele people who are also indigenous to Zimbabwe.\n\nUsing an elite force of military killers trained by North Korea, Mugabe is believed to be behind the killing of at least 20,000 people. Having consolidated his power, Mugabe used it to offer international support for the world\u2019s communists, from those in South Africa to communist rulers across the planet in China and Cuba.\n\nDespite the mass extermination of black people that allowed him to stay in power for nearly 40 years, African leaders applauded his tenure on Friday.\n\nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari \u2013 who became the nation\u2019s president in 2015 after being its dictator in the 1980s \u2013 hailed Mugabe through a statement from spokesman Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari believes Mugabe\u2019s sacrifices, especially in struggling for the political and economic emancipation of his people, will always be remembered by posterity,\u201d Adesina said. \u201cHe, however, prayed that the Almighty God will grant the soul of the former president rest and comfort his loved ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cSouth Africans join the people and government of Zimbabwe in mourning the passing of a liberation fighter and champion of Africa\u2019s cause against colonialism,\u201d South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his statement. \u201cUnder President Mugabe\u2019s leadership, Zimbabwe\u2019s sustained and valiant struggle against colonialism inspired our own struggle against apartheid and built in us the hope that one day South Africa too would be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cComrade Mugabe was an outstanding revolutionary, a tenacious freedom fighter, and a dedicated Pan Africanist,\u201d said the president of Namibia, Hage Geingob. \u201cHe made enormous sacrifices in the struggle against injustice and the liberation of Southern Africa from racial subjugation and colonial oppression.\u201d\n\nThe government of Iran, which maintains friendly ties to all communist dictatorships, also offered its condolences.\n\n\u201cMugabe after Zimbabwe\u2019s independence continued to stand firm in defense of his country\u2019s national sovereignty against foreign interference,\u201d Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Seyyed Abbas Mousavi told reporters, thanking Mugabe for his support of the Islamic regime. Iran\u2019s Mehr News Agency reported that Mousavi referred to Mugabe as a \u201chero.\u201d\n\nIn Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang called Mugabe \u201cexceptional.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Robert Mugabe was an exceptional leader of the national liberation movement and politician of Zimbabwe, who spent his lifetime safeguarding national sovereignty and independence, opposing external interferences and promoting the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Zimbabwe and the other parts of Africa,\u201d Geng told reporters. \u201cWe deeply mourn his passing and extend sincere condolences to the Zimbabwean government and people as well as his family.\u201d\n\nThe Castro regime in Cuba did not issue a Foreign Ministry statement because it had Deputy Foreign Minister Marcelino Medina Gonzalez in Harare meeting with high-ranking officials at the time.\n\nMedina reportedly offered \u201ccondolences and solidarity\u201d to the ruling Zanu-PF party, to which Mugabe belonged but which also ousted him in 2017 with the support of the military. Medina is in Zimbabwe to reportedly improve bilateral ties and will conduct a four-nation tour of Africa before he returns to Havana.\n\nThe Venezuelan socialist regime, which operates as a proxy of Cuba\u2019s, has not at press time issued an official statement of condolence, nor has North Korea\u2019s. Venezuela\u2019s state-owned broadcaster VTV, however, did publish an article stating that \u201cmany consider him a hero who ended the rule of the white minority in the African nation.\u201d\n\nAt home, current President Emmerson Mnangagwa \u2013 Mugabe\u2019s former vice president who orchestrated a coup against him \u2013 called Mugabe \u201can icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people.\u201d\n\nMugabe likely died a billionaire; his net worth at the time of his ouster in 2017 was estimated to be over $1 billion. As part of his agreement with Mnangagwa post-coup, the Zimbabwean taxpayer was responsible for paying for the salaries of at least 20 caretakers, three luxury vehicles, up to four international flights on private jets, and a \u201creasonable\u201d mansion.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Some of the world's most authoritarian nations offered condolences to the government of Zimbabwe over the death of dictator Robert Mugabe.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/mugabe-fist-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
