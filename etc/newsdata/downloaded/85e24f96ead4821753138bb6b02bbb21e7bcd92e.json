Skies are mostly sunny as highs rise to 80 or a bit beyond. Winds out of the northwest blow around 5 to 10 mph. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Clouds increase overnight. A few showers aren\u2019t impossible, but most spots should stay dry. Lows again range from the upper 50s to mid-60s. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nA small system passing to our south may keep us rather cloudy into Monday. Some showers remain possible, but the best odds of any appreciable rain should stay to our south. Highs aim for the mid-70s to near 80. Confidence: Medium\n\nBy Tuesday, the little weather disturbance for Monday should be offshore and moving away. This means we see sunshine return. Humidity is back up to moderate levels, so highs in the near-80 to mid-80s range feel a bit summerlike.
