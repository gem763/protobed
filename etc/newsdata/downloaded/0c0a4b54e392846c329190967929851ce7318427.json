No one is expecting or even wants you to be a brilliant, polished, professional after-dinner speaker. You don't need to try get 'in character' and become someone other than exactly who you are right now. Be yourself. Who you are right now is the reason you're speaking.'\n\nRelax\n\n'Know that the audience is 100 per cent on your side from the moment you stand up. You're among friends - the best possible environment for your speech.\n\n'Everyone wants you to succeed and have fun. No one is out to criticize you. Everyone is there to have a good time and will forgive virtually anything, so be real and focus on entertaining yourself first by knowing you're saying what you want to say to the bride and groom on their wedding day.\n\nBe real\n\n'Audiences crave authenticity, especially in today's digital world, and will happily follow you wherever you lead them as long as you're real,' Den said.\n\nBe genuine\n\nAnd to finish? Please, please skip the lofty Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde quotes.\n\n'Bring the bride and groom together as a couple by offering a quick, one-sentence toast that is sincere but might tie in an earlier point or two of humor,' Den advised.\n\nAsk the pro: Den Pope's top tips for writing a wedding speech Be authentic.\n\nDon't use empty platitudes like, 'You were made for each other.'\n\nDon't gush or become hyperbolic.\n\nResist temptation to follow overused online templates (if it's on the internet, it's already been over done!)\n\nDon't be afraid to go deep with memories.\n\nMake sure it's personal.\n\nResist the overused, like, 'I'm not losing a daughter, I'm gaining a son!'\n\nWith a Masters in Journalism and decades' worth of experience in the world of communications and media, Den originally began writing wedding speeches after a 'casual request' from a marketing client who needed help solidifying his rambling thoughts ahead of his brother's wedding.\n\n'I not only found I enjoyed writing wedding speeches and was good at it, but it was the first time I felt like I was adding some real value to the world,' Den told DailyMail.com.\n\n'Put another way, the world doesn't need another ad campaign for insurance, but the world needs great wedding speeches,' he laughed.\n\nHowever, even though he'd seemingly found his niche - and an in demand one at that - it took several more years and 'two epiphanies' before he formalized the hobby as a business.\n\nAudiences crave authenticity, especially in today's digital world\n\n'Everyone has a fun, warm, original speech inside of them,' Den said.\n\n'The problem is they also have years of thoughts, feelings and experiences about the bride or groom banging around in their head too and it all feels like chaos.'\n\n'In addition to many years of speech writing and performance coaching experience, my real value to clients is perspective. I help them step back to identify and organize what's already inside of them but they can't get to it because they're part of the story and too close to it.'\n\nDen explained that it's a 'two step process' with clients, beginning with a discussion guide of 15 steps which aims to evoke some initial memories and 'narrow their thinking' for the speech. Then, he spends an hour on the phone with clients 'going deeper' on some of the information.\n\nHe adds: 'Clients often tell me they feel like our conversation is a therapy session. It enables them to articulate and understand their feelings about the bride and groom and their relationship.\n\n'I want to get to know their values, personality, character and sense of humor because every word of this speech has to be in their voice to be authentic.'\n\nThe speech writing process itself takes at least seven hours.\n\n'I edit it as many as six or seven times over a period of a week or two. I also listen to the speech being read back to me over and over and am continually asking myself, 'Would she say this? And if so, would she use these words to say it?'\n\n'Then I send the speech to the client and ask them to read it out loud to themselves a few times start to finish without stopping.'\n\n'I'm looking for any words or phrases that don't feel quite right or roll off the tongue. I can usually hit the speech at least 90 percent out of the gate and will refine any words or phrases then move into the delivery phase if they're nervous.'\n\nBusiness is certainly flying too, as Den reveals he is already taking bookings for weddings in September 2020.\n\nNo one is expecting or even wants you to be a brilliant, polished, professional after-dinner speaker. You don't need to get \"in character\" and become someone other than exactly who you are\n\n'I've been invited to the wedding to hear 'my' speech being read at least five or six times, including airfare and lodging. But I've never accepted,' Don admitted.\n\n'While I appreciate the offer, I'd rather they enjoy their moment without me looming about. I don't ask for them, but I enjoy receiving videos and photos from clients delivering their speech.\n\n'It's such a great feeling to see them up there kicking a**, having fun and surprising themselves by doing something they weren't sure they could do.'\n\nDen said that some people do tell their loved ones that they've outsourced the speech.\n\n'Some do, most don't,' Den admitted. 'If they ask my opinion, I tell them ours is like a doctor-patient or attorney-client relationship they should keep between us.\n\n'I sometimes get emails from clients who say they felt \"guilty\" or \"uncomfortable\" with all the compliments they received at the reception because they 'didn't write it,' or something similar. I tell them that's nonsense.\n\n'On the contrary, every word was theirs. The speech is all them. I'm just the guide who helps them identify and organize what's already inside of them.'\n\n'I want everyone I work with to simply stand up, knock this thing out of the park and enjoy all of the compliments they deserve. I want this to be one of the best experiences of their life.'", "description": "Den Pope, a Chicago-based speechwriter, has been discreetly creating memorable, humorous and emotive speeches for fathers of the bride and best men for over 20 years.", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/19699268-0-image-a-25_1572354116774.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
