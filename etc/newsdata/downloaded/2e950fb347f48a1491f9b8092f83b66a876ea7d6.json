(AP) \u2014 NASCAR made the first significant changes to its schedule in years by shuffling the 2020 season into a freshened new sequence that tries to meet the wants of fans to the best of its current ability.\n\nThe 2020 schedule was released Tuesday at ISM Raceway outside Phoenix, which will host the season finale.\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway got July 5 to give the iconic track back-to-back summer holiday weekends. Daytona gave up its traditional and often rain-wrecked July 4 weekend for the final race of the regular season, when the playoff field will be completed.\n\nPocono Raceway will run both its 400-mile races on back-to-back June afternoons, Martinsville Speedway got a Mother's Day race under the lights and also a slot in the playoffs \u2014 one of three short tracks featured in NASCAR's 10-race playoffs. Even better for Martinsville, it got the penultimate race for the championship finale.\n\nBristol and Richmond short tracks both joined the playoffs, as did Darlington Raceway.\n\nNEW FINALE: Arizona lands NASCAR championship race for 2020\n\nDATE CHANGE: Brickyard 400 is on the move again\n\nREACTION: Fans are mixed, but drivers love it\n\nIMPACT: Schedule shift great for two drivers\n\nThe season ends one week shorter than usual, but still includes 38 events that run from a Feb. 9 exhibition race at Daytona through the finale on Nov. 8 at renovated ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix. That includes consecutive weekends off for the first time in the modern era so that NBC Sports can focus on the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nCharlotte Motor Speedway retained the All-Star race, but Speedway Motorsports chairman Marcus Smith told The Associated Press he was amenable to moving the event to Nashville in 2021.\n\nMartinsville Speedway will be the penultimate race for the championship finale. (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSmith said IndyCar was also welcome to negotiate doubleheader weekends with a handful of SMI-owned tracks, among them are Las Vegas during its new playoff date in late September that offers cooler temperatures than last year's sun-roasted playoff opener. IndyCar has not raced at Las Vegas since Dan Wheldon's fatal 2011 accident there.\n\nSmith also welcomed talks with IndyCar on the \"Roval\" at Charlotte Motor Speedway and as a NASCAR companion to Texas during its fall event. IndyCar's aims each year to end its season earlier than any of Smith's ideas for SMI-owned tracks.\n\nAlthough he is open to doubleheaders with IndyCar as soon as next season, Smith was a firm 'No' on midweek races. Fans have asked more short tracks, road courses, and even dirt track Eldora Speedway to be added to the stagnant annual schedule. NASCAR was handcuffed by five-year sanction agreements with its existing track partners and won't have the flexibility to add new venues to the schedule until the contracts expire in time for the 2021 schedule.\n\nIt meant NASCAR could only swap its existing partners to the interests that suited all the parties involved. There have been calls for midweek races, but Smith was firm in that it was not a financial risk he was willing to make with one of the eight SMI venues with Cup races. He would have done a doubleheader, but said he believes it should be a unique event and special to Pocono.\n\nSMI scored victories in moving Atlanta into a weather-friendlier date in March, as well as the first visit to Texas moving a week after hunting season opens. Bristol is now the first elimination race of the playoffs, while the roval at Charlotte is the eliminating race of the second round of the playoffs. Las Vegas also follows the Feb. 16 Daytona 500 as the first race of NASCAR annual trip West.\n\nInternational Speedway Corp., the company controlled by the NASCAR-owning France Family, moved the season finale to ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix. The company just spent more than $175 million renovating the facility and there hasn't been enough of a buzz worth keeping the event at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The track has hosted the final race since 2002 and the Cup series champion has been the race winner since the current format was introduced in 2014.\n\nISC shoved a race there in March, a month few track operators want because of weather concerns that shouldn't be as big an issue in the Miami area.\n\nMartinsville is perhaps the big winner with not only a race under its new lights system, but a race that will decide the championship field of four.\n\nThe playoffs now begin at Darlington on Sept. 6, go to Richmond, Bristol, Las Vegas, Talladega, Charlotte, Kansas, Texas, Martinsville then finally ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix.\n\n2020 NASCAR Cup Series schedule\n\n(Date, track, time, TV and radio)\n\nSun., Feb. 9: Daytona 500 Qualifying, 12 p.m., FOX, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Feb. 9: Advance Auto Parts Clash, 3 p.m., FS1, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nThurs., Feb. 13: Gander RV Duel at DAYTONA, 7 p.m., FS1, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Feb. 16: Daytona 500 , 2:30 p.m., FOX, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Feb. 23: Las Vegas Motor Speedway, 3:30 p.m., FOX, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., March 1: Auto Club Speedway, 3:30 p.m., FOX, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., March 8: ISM Raceway, 3:30 p.m., FOX, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., March 15: Atlanta Motor Speedway, 2 p.m., FOX, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., March 22: Homestead-Miami Speedway, 2 p.m., FOX, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., March 29: Texas Motor Speedway, 2 p.m., FS1, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., April 5: Bristol Motor Speedway, 2 p.m., FS1, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., April 19: Richmond Raceway, 2 p.m., FOX, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., April 26: Talladega Superspeedway, 2 p.m., FOX, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., May 3: Dover International Speedway, 2 p.m., FS1, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSat., May 9: Martinsville Speedway, 8 p.m., FS1, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSat., May 16: All-Star Open, 7 p.m., FS1, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSat., May 16: All-Star Race, 9 p.m., FS1, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., May 24: Charlotte Motor Speedway, 6 p.m., FOX, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., May 31: Kansas Speedway, 2 p.m., FS1, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., June 7: Michigan International Speedway, 2 p.m., FS1, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., June 14: Sonoma Raceway, 3 p.m., FS1, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., June 21: Chicagoland Speedway, 2:30 p.m., NBCSN, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSat., June 27: Pocono Raceway, 3 p.m., NBCSN, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., June 28: Pocono Raceway, 3:30 p.m., NBCSN, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., July 5: Indianapolis Motor Speedway, 3:30 p.m., NBC, IMS/SiriusXM\n\nSat., July 11: Kentucky Speedway, 7:30 p.m., NBCSN, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., July 19: New Hampshire Motor Speedway, 3 p.m., NBCSN, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Aug. 9: Michigan International Speedway, 3 p.m., NBCSN, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Aug. 16: Watkins Glen International, 3 p.m., NBCSN, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Aug. 23: Dover International Speedway, 3 p.m., NBCSN, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSat., Aug. 29: Daytona International Speedway, 7:30 p.m., NBC, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Sept. 6: Darlington Raceway, 6 p.m., NBCSN, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSat., Sept. 12: Richmond Raceway, 7:30 p.m., NBCSN, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSat., Sept. 19: Bristol Motor Speedway, 7:30 p.m., NBCSN, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Sept. 27: Las Vegas Motor Speedway, 7 p.m., NBCSN, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Oct. 4: Talladega Superspeedway, 2 p.m., NBC, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Oct. 11: Charlotte Motor Speedway, 2:30 p.m., NBC, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Oct. 18: Kansas Speedway, 2:30 p.m., NBC, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Oct. 25: Texas Motor Speedway, 3 p.m., NBCSN, PRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Nov. 1: Martinsville Speedway, 2 p.m., NBC, MRN/SiriusXM\n\nSun., Nov. 8: ISM Raceway, 3 p.m., NBC, MRN/SiriusXM", "description": "NASCAR has announced some significant changes for the 2020 schedule, including season-ending race shifting to Phoenix area.", "authors": ["Published P.M.
