I sincerely hope the CBS case is my last lawsuit for these fine clients and friends.\"\n\nA CBS spokesman agreed that \"the case had been amicably resolved.\"\n\nThe final settlement amount was not disclosed, but the complaint, filed in Michigan, was seeking no less than $250 million in compensatory damages and no less than $500 million in punitive damages.\n\nJonBen\u00e9t's brutal death was the subject of a massive investigation by law enforcement officials in Colorado, and the mysterious circumstances of her killing captivated the public for decades, spawning countless conspiracy theories.\n\nMovies 'Casting JonBen\u00e9t' Is A New Look At An Old Case 'Casting JonBen\u00e9t' Is A New Look At An Old Case Listen \u00b7 7:37 7:37\n\nThe girl was killed inside her Boulder home during the early morning hours of Dec. 26, 1996. She was discovered by her father, John Ramsey, in the basement of the house strangled and with a fractured skull.\n\nAs NPR reported, a grand jury decided to indict \"John and Patsy Ramsey on two counts each of child abuse, but that the prosecutor declined to sign the indictment against the couple.\"\n\nSpecifically, the indictment \"alleged that the parents permitted JonBen\u00e9t to be placed in a dangerous situation that led to her death and it accused them of helping whoever killed the girl,\" The Denver Post reported.\n\nPatsy Ramsey died in 2006. In 2008, Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy, formally apologized to the family in a letter, saying neither the parents nor the son were considered suspects. Lacy added that new DNA evidence, unavailable in 1996, pointed to an unknown male as JonBen\u00e9t's killer.\n\n\"To the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime, I am deeply sorry,\" Lacy wrote.\n\nNo one has been charged in the case, and the investigation is still open.\n\nRamsey's lawsuit against CBS; Critical Content, the production company behind the four-hour documentary; and seven others involved, including James Kolar, author of Foreign Faction, a book that posited JonBen\u00e9t's brother as the killer, noted that he had never voluntarily participated in any media or public interviews concerning his sister's death until he learned of the project.\n\n\"In September of [2016], following decades of silence and only after learning that CBS was planning to broadcast a JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey show based on Foreign Faction in which it would accuse him of killing JonBen\u00e9t, Burke exercised his right of reasonable response by granting one interview to Dr. Phil McGraw in which he denied any involvement in JonBen\u00e9t's murder,\" the complaint reads.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2000, Ramsey sued several publications and networks for publishing material accusing him of committing the crime. They were all dismissed after confidential settlements, the lawsuit says, noting that \"no member of the tabloid media or the mainstream media has ever again accused Burke of being involved in \u2014 or suspected of \u2014 JonBen\u00e9t's murder.\"\n\n\"That is, until CBS aired the Documentary,\" the document continues.\n\nThe Case Of: JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, as the series was called, purported to be a complete \"reinvestigation\" of the cold case and promised to feature a cadre of experts who had independently reached the same conclusion as that presented in Kolar's book: that the 6-year-old's brother had killed her.\n\nThe complaint argued that those involved in the making of the documentary were not motivated by authentic reporting but rather had set out \"to accomplish their goals of achieving ratings and profits.\"\n\nIt contended: \"CBS perpetrated a fraud upon the public \u2014 instead of being a documentary based on a new investigation by a so-called team of experts, The Case of: JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey was a fictional crime show based primarily on a preconceived storyline scripted in a self-published and commercially unsuccessful book, Foreign Faction.\"", "description": "Burke Ramsey reached a confidential settlement with the network, the production company and several individuals behind a documentary series that claimed he killed his 6-year-old sister when he was 9.", "authors": ["Vanessa Romo"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/04/gettyimages-606508224_wide-e6c116bad48e19961a8c39e9569dadda3dbbf70e.jpg?s=1400"}
