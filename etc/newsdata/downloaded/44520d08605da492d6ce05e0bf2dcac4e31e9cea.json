(Picture: NBC/NTSB)\n\nA father is suing Tesla after his son and another teen burned to death in a fiery crash while driving at 116mph.\n\nIn the lawsuit, parents Edgar Monserratt and Esperanza Martinez de Monserratt acknowledged that their 18-year-old son Edgar\u2019s friend, Barret Riley, 18, was driving at an incredibly high rate of speed before the crash that killed them both on May 8, 2018 in For Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nHowever, Edgar\u2019s parents claim that the 2014 Tesla Model S should have never gone that fast, the Miami Herald reports.\n\nThree days before the deadly crash, Barrett got a ticket for driving at 112mph through a 50mph zone, according to the suit.\n\nThe next day, Barrett\u2019s parents brought the car to Tesla to install a device that limited the car\u2019s speed to 85mph, the lawsuit claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the Tesla mechanics \u2018improperly removed the speed limiter/governor without the permission and consent of\u2019 Riley\u2019s parents.\n\nBarret\u2019s father, James Riley has also filed a similar lawsuit.\n\n'Teen mother sliced newborn baby's neck then hid the body in her purse'\n\nBoth parents blame the electric car\u2019s lithium-ion battery for exploding and causing a deadly inferno when the Tesla hit a concrete wall.\n\nThe Fort Lauderdale Fire Department did not see a visible fire when they responded to the crash, but they sprayed it with water and foam anyway, according to a National Transportation Safety Board investigation.\n\n\u2018During the loading of the car for removal from the scene, the battery reignited and was quickly extinguished. Upon arrival at the storage yard, the battery reignited again. A local fire department responded to the storage yard and extinguished the fire,\u2019 the NTSB report says.\n\nAlthough one of the lawsuits claims the crash should have been \u2018entirely survivable,\u2019 Tesla released a statement earlier this year saying: \u2018No car could have withstood high-speed crash of this kind.\u2019", "description": "Parents are suing Tesla after two teens died in a fiery car crash in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1570722344_1570726882.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
