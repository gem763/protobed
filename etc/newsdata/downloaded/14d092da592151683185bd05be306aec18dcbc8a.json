I feel very, very close. I\u2019m just fine with where my game is. It will be good for Korea,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased the things I\u2019ve been working on, wedges, distance control, spin control were spot-on this week so I\u2019m very pleased with it.\u201d\n\nKoepka acknowledged not making a lot of putts, and speculated that his green-reading skills were a bit rusty.\n\nAtop the leaderboard, local resident Kevin Na shot the day\u2019s best score, a 62, to join fellow Americans Lucas Glover (63), Patrick Cantlay (64) and Brian Stuard (65) at 12-under 130.\n\nNa has good memories of a course where he notched his first PGA Tour victory in 2011, and he certainly knows the lay of the land around and on the greens.\n\nHe sank three putts from longer than 35 feet, including a 60-foot monster at the first hole.\n\n\u201cI know the greens can be a little bumpy in the afternoon but I was making putts,\u201d he said in what might qualify as a significant understatement.", "description": "World number one Brooks Koepka made his first appearance of the new PGA Tour season a brief one when he missed the cut at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437219516&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9400A", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
