She then teamed with Ai-jen Poo, who heads the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and Alicia Garza, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe idea was, how do we actually pull together all the threads of women who have been self-organizing, hundreds of new women\u2019s organizations that have popped up all around the country,\u201d explained Richards, \u201cand actually provide more organizing-training, advocacy skills, intentional work across racial and generational lines.\u201d She said the goal is to \u201cgalvanize and aggregate 2 million women\u201d by next summer.\n\n\u201cI believe women will be the determining factor. They always are, but in 2020, women will determine the future of that election, and, frankly, the future of the country,\u201d Richards said. \u201cOur goal is to spend this next 12 months aggregating 2 million women,\u201d Richards said. \u201cTraining them, organizing them, connecting them, and providing them the skills so that we can run the biggest voter mobilization of women-to-women outreach that we\u2019ve ever seen in the United States of America, and change who\u2019s in the White House, and change elected office holders all across the country.\u201d\n\nOne of the things Richards said Supermajority will be issuing soon is a women\u2019s New Deal that will have economic equity and access to health care among its pillars. The reason for this is simple: \u201cWhen women elect the next president, I want to make sure that they have women\u2019s issues front and center and that they aren\u2019t put by the side.\u201d\n\nListen to the podcast to hear Richards get personal talking about her mother, the late legendary Texas governor Ann Richards, and her daughter Lily Adams, who is the communications director for the presidential campaign of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). \u201cI feel like, actually, I\u2019m just the genetic link between Ann Richards and Lily Adams, really,\u201d Richards said. \u201cI feel like Lily got all of mom\u2019s DNA.\u201d And hear Richards\u2019s advice to women to stop waiting to do something.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor women, for most of our lives, we waited until everything was perfect \u2014 like we had [to wait until] the kids were the right age or we had all the right degrees or we had all the right experience,\u201d Richards told me. \u201cAnd, so, my message to all women right now is start before you\u2019re ready. Don\u2019t wait. Don\u2019t wait for the perfect opportunity. Don\u2019t wait for someone to ask you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCape Up\u201d is Jonathan\u2019s weekly podcast talking to key figures behind the news and our culture.
