Financials\n\nwere among the best performers, aided by the rise in bond\n\nyields.\n\nStill, the benchmark S&P 500 rose for a third straight week\n\nand stood about 0.6% from its record closing high set on July\n\n26.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was\n\npotentially open to an interim trade deal with China, although\n\nhe stressed an \"easy\" agreement would not be possible. That was\n\nfollowed up on Friday by China's official Xinhua News Agency\n\nannouncing the country would exempt some U.S. agricultural\n\nproducts, such as pork and soybeans, from additional tariffs.\n\nReports showing solid U.S. retail sales and a measure of\n\nU.S. consumer sentiment above expectations added to the optimism\n\nand eased concerns about economic growth, although the Federal\n\nReserve was still widely expected to cut rates at its policy\n\nmeeting on Wednesday. The Bank of Japan is to follow with its\n\nannouncement on Thursday. \"We've had these small concessions back and forth, which at\n\nminimum gives investors some confidence that things are moving\n\nin the right direction,\" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment\n\nofficer at NovaPoint in Atlanta.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36.28 points,\n\nor 0.13%, to 27,218.73, the S&P 500 lost 2.3 points, or\n\n0.08%, to 3,007.27 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped\n\n17.75 points, or 0.22%, to 8,176.71.\n\nEuropean shares closed higher for a fourth straight session\n\nto notch their fourth straight week of gains, as the positive\n\ntone surrounding the U.S.-China trade talks pushed cyclical\n\nsectors such as banks and miners higher. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.34% and\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained\n\n0.20%. MSCI's index notched its eighth straight day of gains to\n\nmark its longest winning streak in nearly two years.\n\nThe U.S. economic data and easing of trade tensions helped\n\nlift bond yields to multi-week highs, with yields on 10-year\n\nnotes reaching a six-week high and those on 30-year bonds\n\ntouching their highest in five weeks. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1-1/32 in\n\nprice to yield 1.9046%, from 1.791% late on Thursday.\n\nThe euro gained against the dollar for a second day,\n\nalthough gains were pared after the release of the U.S. data, as\n\nthe European Central Bank on Thursday exempted euro zone banks\n\nfrom a penalty charge, which analysts say will reduce the\n\ncurrency impact of new stimulus. The dollar index fell 0.12%, with the euro up\n\n0.13% to $1.1075.\n\nOil prices dipped, and both Brent and WTI posted weekly\n\ndeclines. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled down 0.44% at $54.85 per\n\nbarrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $60.22, down 0.26% on the\n\nday.
