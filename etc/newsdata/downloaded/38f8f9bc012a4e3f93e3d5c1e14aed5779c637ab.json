It\u2019s yes, a gutsy move \u2014 and one that pays off.\n\nMany young readers were introduced to Raina Telgemeier through \u201cSmile,\u201d her 2010 autobiographical tale of the dental misadventures of her youth. Her hit follow-ups included \u201cSisters,\u201d another true story from her Bay Area upbringing.\n\nNow Telgemeier completes her personal trilogy with \u201cGuts\u201d (available Sept. 17), which chronicles her battles with anxiety while growing up, including bouts of nausea and fear of potentially disagreeable foods.\n\nWinningly on exhibit again in \u201cGuts\u201d is Telgemeier\u2019s warm honesty. She writes and draws her phobias and insecurities with knowing humor. It\u2019s an appealing approach that has made her a best-selling, brand-name author among middle-grade readers. Millions of students snap up what at least one media outlet has dubbed a \u201cTelgememoir.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cGuts,\u201d young Raina, the sensitive avatar on the page, has become a richly developed character. Her expressive eyes help readers empathize with her challenges, which in \u201cGuts\u201d include gripping her belly and fleeing the scene \u2014 panic-attack moments that Telgemeier poignantly depicts in ripples of deep, queasy green.\n\n[Raina Telgemeier became a hero to millions of readers by showing how uncomfortable growing up can be]\n\nAmid Raina\u2019s stomach woes, \u201cGuts\u201d also delivers on a Telgemeier trademark: capturing the universal experience of navigating the ever-tenuous social structure at school. Friendship triangles and false perceptions heighten the classroom and cafeteria drama.\n\nRaina eventually goes to therapy to treat her anxiety, and these sessions are handled with a deft sensitivity in which young readers, perhaps facing similar fears, can find comfort. It\u2019s an accomplishment that renders the book a must-get for not only school librarians, but also clinicians who treat children. (Telgemeier writes in the afterword of the various therapies she has used, further destigmatizing such treatment for school-age readers.)\n\nBest of all, \u201cGuts\u201d \u2014 a story not only of sore tummies, but also of courage and intestinal fortitude \u2014 should prove to be a conversation-starter between children and adults. There are too few such graphic novels in the YA market. \u201cGuts\u201d should naturally appeal to the millions of young Americans diagnosed with anxiety, yet the story holds reassuring lessons for any kid facing down fears and the people who love them.\n\nRaina Telgemeier will be at Small Press Expo in North Bethesda on Sept. 14-15.", "description": "The beloved graphic novelist writes bravely about her childhood anxieties in \u201cGuts.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael Cavna", "Writer Artist For Comic Riffs", "Covering Visual Storytelling", "Cartoon Art Illustration", "Comedy Satire", "Writer Critic", "September At Am", "Writer Artist Visual Storyteller Michael Cavna Is Creator Of The Comic Riffs Column", "Graphic-Novel Reviewer For The Washington Post'S Book World."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zwocsZYe6dEQ5W2P3C8T5cwMaX0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EV33B7GVPQI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
