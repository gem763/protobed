The central bank has been consulting on a plan to boost levels of high-quality Tier-1 capital to 16% of lenders\u2019 risk-weighted assets over five years, but has said the transition period and other details are still up for discussion.\n\nBanks and other submitters have called on the central bank to publish a cost-benefit analysis of its proposals, but the RBNZ has said it will only do so in a regulatory impact assessment when its final decision is reached.\n\n\u201cNot publicly consulting on the comprehensive cost-benefit analysis creates challenges for the public and stakeholders to provide feedback on the assumptions the RBNZ ultimately relies upon,\u201d Treasury says.\n\nNeither the finance minister nor the Treasury have a formal role in setting bank capital requirements, which is the responsibility of the RBNZ. Robertson has urged banks and commentators to engage in a mature, constructive debate over the proposals.\n\nThe Treasury will not subject the RBNZ proposals to a peer review, despite some lenders requesting an independent analysis, according to notes prepared for a May 24 meeting between the Treasury Secretary and some local bank executives.\n\nIn the report to Robertson, Treasury says higher bank capital will support resilience during an economic shock and makes lenders less likely to fail. Still, the costs are also likely to be significant.\n\n\u201cHolding more capital will have ongoing economic costs and wider impacts on interest rates, overall economic activity, particular sectors, the market landscape and the Crown\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d it said. \u201cThe extent of these impacts is uncertain.\u201d", "description": "RBNZ Needs to Better Explain Bank-Review Benefits, Treasury Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5f087ab7c361456a7c1768087e2aa12f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
