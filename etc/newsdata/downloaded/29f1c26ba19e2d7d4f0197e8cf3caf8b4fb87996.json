The unrest has spread from transport workers to indigenous demonstrators.\n\nIn a defiant national television address on Monday evening, Moreno, who has left the capital Quito, said he would not back down on the fuel price hike in the face of what he called a 'destabilisation plan'.\n\nThe recent wave of protests in the capital of Quito comes in the wake of a number of new austerity measures imposed by the Government of Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno\n\nEcuadorian military stand guard at the Puente de la Unidad Nacional (National Unity Bridge) in Guayaquil on October 08, 2019, following days of protests against the sharp rise in fuel prices sparked by authorities' decision to scrap subsidies\n\nThe President says his predecessor is trying to destabilise the nation with the help of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nEcuador is among dozens of nations calling for Maduro's ouster.\n\nHowever, Correa denied on Tuesday he was orchestrating a coup against the government from his self-imposed exile in Belgium.\n\n'They are such liars ... They say I am so powerful that with an iPhone from Brussels I could lead the protests,' he said.\n\nCorrea denied on Tuesday he was orchestrating a coup against the government from his self-imposed exile in Belgium\n\nThe former president of Ecuador said austerity measures imposed by the South American nation's leader is what has forced people to take to the streets in protest\n\n'People couldn't take it anymore, that's the reality,' he said, referring to austerity measures brought in by Moreno with support from the IMF.\n\nMoreno, who once saw his predecessor as a mentor, has in recent times abandoned the leftist policies of Correa's time as president from 2007 to 2017, a rare period of stability for a country accustomed to political turmoil but which ended in corruption allegations and a rise in Ecuador's external debt.\n\nCorrea, who lives with his wife in a small town south of Brussels, has fiercely criticized Moreno's shift to the right, including with a video circulating on social media where he sings 'Ecuadoreans, to the streets ... Goodbye, Lenin!'\n\nHe reiterated that view on Tuesday, saying that 'the government has already fallen' and that he did not expect Moreno, who is in the southern port city of Guayaquil, to be able to return to Quito to govern while the protests continue.\n\n'Why don't they announce early elections,' he said, calling on Ecuadoreans to exercise the right to resist what he called government oppression.\n\nProtesters in Quito on Monday protect themselves from tear gas and hold up a banner which translated to English says 'Out Lenin'\n\nIn an interview with Reuters Correa said he would be ready to return to his country if new elections were called and potentially run as a candidate for vice president\n\nSitting in an empty office with an Ecuadorean flag and his official photograph as president, Correa said he would be ready to return, possibly as a candidate for vice president, if new elections were called.\n\n'If it's necessary, I will go back. I would have to be a candidate for something, for example, vice president,' said Correa, who said he earns a living in Brussels partly consulting for the Venezuela government and interviews for Russia's RT channel, which is backed by the Russian state.\n\n'From there, we would need a constituent assembly,' he said, although he declined to give details about any future government policies. 'This isn't my plan, I am obliged to do this.'\n\nHe also denied any direct links to Venezuela's Maduro, who France, the United States and several Latin American nations accuse of installing a dictatorship as a political and economic crisis deepens in Venezuela.\n\nBut he also accused the United States and the European Union of hypocrisy for imposing economic sanctions on the Maduro government, which stands accused of rights abuses.\n\n'They have a criminal blockade (against Venezuela). They must lift it.'\n\nRafael Correa has also denied any direct links to Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro (pictured above) who France, the United States and several Latin American nations accuse of installing a dictatorship\n\nCorrea, who said he was working on five different books, defended his decision to live in his wife's native Belgium after leaving office in 2017. He said that it was right that after 26 years living as a couple in Ecuador, they spend time in Belgium.\n\nBut he also acknowledged he faced 29 different charges against him, from corruption to misuse of power, in Ecuador, and that he would not go back unless the political situation changed because he said he would not be given a fair hearing.\n\n'I have to prepare my legal case. They have asked Interpol to raise a red alert and capture me, I had to hire a lawyer ... it is an enormous task. In the last few years, I've worked just to pay lawyers.'", "description": "President Lenin Moreno has moved his administration from capital, Quito, alleging he is the target of a coup attempt.
