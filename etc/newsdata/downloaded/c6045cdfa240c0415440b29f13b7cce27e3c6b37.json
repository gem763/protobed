Cinema offers us complete immersion in another reality, taking us on an almost out-of-body experience into someone else\u2019s life and experience.\n\nBut as one oft-filmed character says, with great power comes great responsibility, and the very best films use that power to help us. They might offer an escape from our own lives, the catharsis of a huge hit of action, horror or adventure that makes our own everyday problems seem small. They might reflect our lives on a more human scale, giving us the sense that we are not alone in our concerns and examining our emotion to find the common threads that bind us. Or they could play out possibilities for our own lives, letting us see the consequences of an affair or murder plot unwind before our eyes so we don\u2019t have to flirt with disaster in reality.\n\nFilm is well over a century old now, and with competition from high-quality TV and games it may never again reach the audience numbers that it did in its 1930s golden age. But it can still offer an emotional hit like nothing else when there are hundreds of us together, in the dark, losing ourselves in a moving picture \u2013 and here are 42 of the best ever to sweep us off our feet.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Films to watch before you die 1/42 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford\u2019s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe\u2019s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams's finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO Rex 2/42 The Wings of the Dove (1997) Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn\u2019t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache's motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PS Miramax Films 3/42 Spirited Away (2001) Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki's films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there's meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki's fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it\u2019s unparalleled. HO Toho 4/42 Un Chien Andalou (1928) Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PS 5/42 Avengers (2012) Yes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO Marvel Studios 6/42 The Shining (1980) Stanley Kubrick\u2019s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel; Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO Warner Bros/Hawk Films/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 7/42 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman\u2019s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland\u2019s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PS 8/42 The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) Wes Anderson's meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who\u2019s who of Hollywood in support, it\u2019s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO Buena Vista Pictures 9/42 Lawrence of Arabia (1962) David Lean\u2019s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles \u2013 notably the attack on Aqaba \u2013 with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence\u2019s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HO Rex 10/42 Bicycle Thieves (1948) A devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica\u2019s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job \u2013 but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HO Rex Features 11/42 Farewell My Concubine (1993) Spanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi\u2019s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng\u2019s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HO Miramax Films 12/42 Brazil (1985) Originally titled 1984\u00bd, Terry Gilliam\u2019s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce\u2019s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PS 20th Century Fox 13/42 Tokyo Story (1953) Pauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the \u201ckiss kiss bang bang\u201d of action and romance, but Yasujir\u014d Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It\u2019s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it\u2019s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HO Rex Features 14/42 Double Indemnity (1944) If we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That\u2019s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray\u2019s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck\u2019s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck\u2019s ruthless determination warping MacMurray\u2019s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO Rex Features 15/42 Days of Heaven (1978) Terrence Malick\u2019s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros\u2019s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere\u2019s younger sister. PS Paramount Pictures 16/42 Citizen Kane (1941) The problem with calling something \u201cthe greatest film ever made\u201d is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What\u2019s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HO 17/42 Les Enfants du Paradis (1945) Nirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carn\u00e9's luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema's Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It\u2019s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you\u2019ll ever see. PS Rex Features 18/42 Rear Window (1954) Whether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it\u2019s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart\u2019s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero \u2013 as in Vertigo \u2013 increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won\u2019t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly\u2019s plucky girlfriend in the lion\u2019s mouth. HO 19/42 It Happened One Night (1934) Claudette Colbert's eloping heiress and Clark Gable's hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra's evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that's one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert's skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable's smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PS 20/42 Hoop Dreams (1994) The trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James\u2019s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy\u2019s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PS Kartemquin Films 21/42 The Apartment (1960) This blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it\u2019s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon\u2019s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless; he carries entire scenes without a word. HO Rex 22/42 Paris, Texas (1984) The title of Wim Wenders\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate, it's a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PS 23/42 Synedoche, New York (2008) It\u2019s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork \u2013 literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit \u2013 Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life \u2013 lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It\u2019s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PS Sony Pictures Classics 24/42 Before Midnight (2013) C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater\u2019s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives \u2013 self-inflicted by now \u2013 only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PS 25/42 Le M\u00e9pris (1963) Other Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PS 26/42 Casablanca (1942) Some films strain under the weight of greatness; Casablanca\u2019s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart\u2019s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism; opposite him Ingrid Bergman\u2019s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin' at you, kid. HO 27/42 Meet Me in St Louis (1944) On the surface, Vincente Minnelli's Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It's a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary; and the subtext of \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d is anything but merry. PS Rex 28/42 A Trip to the Moon (1902) Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they\u2019re still beautifully designed and executed. HO Rex Features 29/42 Out of the Past (1947) Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can\u2019t escape old associates \u2013 especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who\u2019s perhaps noir\u2019s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it\u2019s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PS 30/42 His Girl Friday (1940) A screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks's remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there's never a moment to question what\u2019s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HO 31/42 The Conversation (1974) Who's eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PS Paramount Pictures 32/42 Blow Out (1981) John Travolta's Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman's \u00e9lan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It\u2019s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that\u2019s played for keeps. PS Filmways Pictures 33/42 City of God (2002) There\u2019s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio\u2019s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love; on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director K\u00e1tia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO 34/42 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) The diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there's already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen\u2019s modes and tones. PS Rex 35/42 Raising Arizona (1987) The Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PS 20th Century Fox 36/42 Cach\u00e9 (2005) This looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke\u2019s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it\u2019s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HO Rex 37/42 The Bourne Supremacy (2004) Straight up the best Bourne movie \u2013 an experience Ultimatum can\u2019t help but want to repeat, more falteringly \u2013 because of Paul Greengrass\u2019s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon\u2019s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that\u2019s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it\u2019s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PS 38/42 The General (1926) Orson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton\u2019s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton\u2019s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton\u2019s beautifully composed routines. You\u2019ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HO Rex 39/42 The Babadook (2014) The Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can\u2019t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can\u2019t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent\u2019s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PS 40/42 When Harry Met Sally (1989) Is it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it's a paean of sorts to Woody Allen's early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (\"I'll have what she's having\"). It's still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan's careers. Columbia Pictures 41/42 Inside Out (2015) Toy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter\u2019s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What\u2019s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It\u2019s wonderful. Getty 42/42 True Romance (1993) Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road \u2013 the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers \u2013 Tony Scott's True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash \u2013 and totally brilliant. Rex 1/42 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford\u2019s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe\u2019s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams's finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO Rex 2/42 The Wings of the Dove (1997) Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn\u2019t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache's motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PS Miramax Films 3/42 Spirited Away (2001) Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki's films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there's meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki's fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War.

What\u2019s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HO 17/42 Les Enfants du Paradis (1945) Nirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carn\u00e9's luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema's Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It\u2019s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you\u2019ll ever see. PS Rex Features 18/42 Rear Window (1954) Whether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it\u2019s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart\u2019s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero \u2013 as in Vertigo \u2013 increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won\u2019t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly\u2019s plucky girlfriend in the lion\u2019s mouth. HO 19/42 It Happened One Night (1934) Claudette Colbert's eloping heiress and Clark Gable's hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra's evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that's one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert's skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable's smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PS 20/42 Hoop Dreams (1994) The trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James\u2019s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy\u2019s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PS Kartemquin Films 21/42 The Apartment (1960) This blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it\u2019s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon\u2019s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless; he carries entire scenes without a word. HO Rex 22/42 Paris, Texas (1984) The title of Wim Wenders\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate, it's a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PS 23/42 Synedoche, New York (2008) It\u2019s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork \u2013 literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit \u2013 Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life \u2013 lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It\u2019s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PS Sony Pictures Classics 24/42 Before Midnight (2013) C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater\u2019s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives \u2013 self-inflicted by now \u2013 only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PS 25/42 Le M\u00e9pris (1963) Other Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PS 26/42 Casablanca (1942) Some films strain under the weight of greatness; Casablanca\u2019s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart\u2019s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism; opposite him Ingrid Bergman\u2019s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin' at you, kid. HO 27/42 Meet Me in St Louis (1944) On the surface, Vincente Minnelli's Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It's a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary; and the subtext of \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d is anything but merry. PS Rex 28/42 A Trip to the Moon (1902) Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they\u2019re still beautifully designed and executed. HO Rex Features 29/42 Out of the Past (1947) Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can\u2019t escape old associates \u2013 especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who\u2019s perhaps noir\u2019s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it\u2019s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PS 30/42 His Girl Friday (1940) A screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks's remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there's never a moment to question what\u2019s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HO 31/42 The Conversation (1974) Who's eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PS Paramount Pictures 32/42 Blow Out (1981) John Travolta's Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman's \u00e9lan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It\u2019s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that\u2019s played for keeps. PS Filmways Pictures 33/42 City of God (2002) There\u2019s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio\u2019s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love; on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director K\u00e1tia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO 34/42 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) The diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there's already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen\u2019s modes and tones. PS Rex 35/42 Raising Arizona (1987) The Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PS 20th Century Fox 36/42 Cach\u00e9 (2005) This looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke\u2019s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it\u2019s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HO Rex 37/42 The Bourne Supremacy (2004) Straight up the best Bourne movie \u2013 an experience Ultimatum can\u2019t help but want to repeat, more falteringly \u2013 because of Paul Greengrass\u2019s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon\u2019s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that\u2019s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it\u2019s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PS 38/42 The General (1926) Orson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton\u2019s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton\u2019s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton\u2019s beautifully composed routines. You\u2019ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HO Rex 39/42 The Babadook (2014) The Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can\u2019t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can\u2019t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent\u2019s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PS 40/42 When Harry Met Sally (1989) Is it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it's a paean of sorts to Woody Allen's early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (\"I'll have what she's having\"). It's still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan's careers. Columbia Pictures 41/42 Inside Out (2015) Toy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter\u2019s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What\u2019s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It\u2019s wonderful. Getty 42/42 True Romance (1993) Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road \u2013 the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers \u2013 Tony Scott's True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash \u2013 and totally brilliant. Rex\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\n\nWith this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford\u2019s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe\u2019s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u2019s finest scores. Indiana Jones is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO\n\nThe Wings of the Dove (1997)\n\nHenry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly, shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn\u2019t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role; the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u2019s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the very end. PS\n\nSpirited Away (2001)\n\nJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u2019s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myths to Miyazaki\u2019s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it\u2019s unparalleled. HO\n\nUn Chien Andalou (1928)\n\nLuis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PS\n\nAvengers (2012)\n\nYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nStanley Kubrick\u2019s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel; Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)\n\nOne of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman\u2019s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland\u2019s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PS\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums (2001)\n\nWes Anderson\u2019s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who\u2019s who of Hollywood in support, it\u2019s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO\n\nLawrence of Arabia (1962)\n\nDavid Lean\u2019s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles \u2013 notably the attack on Aqaba \u2013 with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence\u2019s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HO\n\nBicycle Thieves (1948)\n\nA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica\u2019s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job \u2013 but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen, he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HO\n\nFarewell My Concubine (1993)\n\nSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi\u2019s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheung\u2019s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HO\n\nBrazil (1985)\n\nOriginally titled 1984\u00bd, Terry Gilliam\u2019s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce\u2019s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PS\n\nTokyo Story (1953)\n\nPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the \u201ckiss kiss bang bang\u201d of action and romance, but Yasujir\u014d Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It\u2019s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it\u2019s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HO\n\nDouble Indemnity (1944)\n\nIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That\u2019s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray\u2019s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck\u2019s femme fatale Phyllis against the will of her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck\u2019s ruthless determination warping MacMurray\u2019s out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO\n\nDays of Heaven (1978)\n\nTerrence Malick\u2019s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerising, gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros\u2019s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere\u2019s younger sister. PS\n\nCitizen Kane (1941)\n\nThe problem with calling something \u201cthe greatest film ever made\u201d is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What\u2019s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation is all too believable. HO\n\nLes Enfants du Paradis (1945)\n\nNirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th-century theatre actors, in Marcel Carn\u00e9\u2019s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u2019s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It\u2019s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you\u2019ll ever see.

For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James\u2019s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake.

PS\n\nThe Apartment (1960)\n\nThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going.

HO\n\nParis, Texas (1984)\n\nThe title of Wim Wenders\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind.

Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director K\u00e1tia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO\n\nHannah and Her Sisters (1986)\n\nThe diverging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u2019s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen\u2019s modes and tones. PS\n\nRaising Arizona (1987)\n\nThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PS\n\nCach\u00e9 (2005)\n\nThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke\u2019s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it\u2019s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HO\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy (2004)\n\nStraight up the best Bourne movie \u2013 an experience Ultimatum can\u2019t help but want to repeat, more falteringly \u2013 because of Paul Greengrass\u2019s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon\u2019s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that\u2019s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it\u2019s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PS\n\nThe General (1926)\n\nOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton\u2019s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton\u2019s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton\u2019s beautifully composed routines. You\u2019ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HO\n\nThe Babadook (2014)\n\nThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can\u2019t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can\u2019t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent\u2019s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PS\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally (1989)\n\nIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephon, it\u2019s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u2019s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (\u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having\u201d). It\u2019s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u2019s careers. PS\n\nInside Out (2015)\n\nToy Story revolutionised animation; Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter\u2019s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What\u2019s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest; adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It\u2019s wonderful. HO\n\nTrue Romance (1993)\n\nDisinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road \u2013 the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers \u2013 Tony Scott's True Romance is a dirty, hyper-violent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score indebted to the fugitive classic Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken's suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash \u2013 and totally brilliant.
