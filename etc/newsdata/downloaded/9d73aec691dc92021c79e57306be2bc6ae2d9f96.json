Ah, no, they just tell the story of intense competition.\n\n\u201cWe are just entering the steepest part of the s-curve for market penetration now.\u201d Is this s-curve the very latest in long drop dunnies?\n\nMichael Messara, from Caledonia, during the UBS Investment Conference in 2016 Daniel Munoz/Fairfax Media\n\nCynically, Caledonia also measures GRUB\u2019s earnings by normalising for its advertising spending, the equivalent of judging BHP\u2019s after excluding its cost of mining.\n\nVicars\u2019 best hope now is for Grubhub to be taken out by an Amazon, which took a stake in Deliveroo in May after shuttering Amazon Restaurants UK in December.\n\nHis style of highly-concentrated investing had been wildly successful until last year. Caledonia has nearly three-quarters of its funds under management in three positions: Grubhub, Zillow and The Stars Group.\n\nIn September 2018, Grubhub shares peaked at US$146.11. They\u2019re now $33.11 (-77.3 per cent).\n\nIn June 2018, Zillow and Stars shares hit US$65.21 and US$37.80 respectively. They closed on Tuesday at US$33.46 (-48.7 per cent) and US$20.20 (-46.6 per cent).\n\nCaledonia was buying at vastly lower prices than the peaks, of course, but its performance (and thus performance fees) is marked to market. Mercifully, Vicars doesn\u2019t pay a 5 to 20 per cent underperformance fee back to his clients in years like these \u2013 or else he\u2019d be selling his yacht! The market\u2019s crueller wags have even taken to calling Messara \u201cMayoshiSon\u201d, for the SoftBank CEO and his run of catastrophic tech investments (our favourite being US$300 million on a dog walking app).\n\nA less vocal Grubhub shareholder Down Under is VGI Partners, whose 13F filings show it with a US$49.9 million position, its 10th largest (in the US). Funnily enough, its executive chairman Rob Luciano is a Caledonia alumnus. And in Vicars\u2019 pet, his and Doug Tynan\u2019s clients have taken a $22 million single-session bath. About time they lost some bark, wouldn\u2019t you say?", "description": "First there was Zillow, then Stars Group and now Grubhub.
