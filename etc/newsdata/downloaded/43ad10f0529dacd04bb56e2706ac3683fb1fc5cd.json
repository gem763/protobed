(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nAfter months of lobbing threats and vowing military reprisals, President Trump will find himself on the same block of Midtown Manhattan as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani this week at the annual U.N. General Assembly.\n\nAt times, Trump has flirted with the idea of meeting with Rouhani for a historic t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, only to retreat to a position of imposing tougher economic sanctions.\n\nTrump\u2019s top advisers privately opposed such a meeting and appeared to win that debate after an attack on Saudi oil facilities on Sept. 14 prompted the United States to impose more sanctions on Tehran. But Trump has not ruled anything out.\n\n\u201cNothing is ever off the table, completely, but I have no intention of meeting with Iran and that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d the president told reporters Sunday on the south lawn of the White House. \u201cI\u2019m a very flexible person.\u201d\n\nEven if Trump changed his mind and extended an invitation, however, it is far from clear that Rouhani would accept, which critics attribute to the Trump administration\u2019s mixed messages.\n\nTrump has tried to appeal to Tehran in various statements, ruling out regime change and entertaining a French plan to extend a line of credit to Iran to return to the 2015 nuclear deal the United States withdrew from last year. But the president\u2019s hawkish advisers have taken a tougher posture: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that Iran is \u201cbloodthirsty and looking for war\u201d and his diplomats did little to help facilitate a meeting in the run-up to the summit, said U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal operations.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pompeo is scheduled to speak at an event hosted by prominent Iran hawk and former diplomat Mark Wallace, who has drawn criticism for including a fringe Iranian diaspora group, Mujahideen-e Khalq, or MEK, in his programming surrounding the summit.\n\nUntil 2012, the MEK was listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States for allegedly killing U.S. personnel in Iran in the 1970s and its links to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It is largely reviled inside Iran due to its alliance with Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq war. It is participating in a dissident convention hosted by Wallace a day before Pompeo\u2019s speech.\n\nAnalysts said Pompeo\u2019s involvement in Wallace\u2019s event risks confusing Trump\u2019s declaration last month that \u201cwe\u2019re not looking for leadership change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely unwise and dangerous decision,\u201d said Dalia Dassa Kaye, director of the center for Middle East public policy at the Rand Corporation.\n\n\u201cThe message this will send is that regime change is still in the mix despite the president\u2019s statements to the contrary. There\u2019s already confusion about U.S. aims on Iran, so this will only raise more questions about what the U.S. has been trying to achieve since its withdrawal from the nuclear agreement,\u201d she said.\n\nA prominent Iran scholar who was scheduled to speak at the same event as Pompeo has dropped out due to the MEK\u2019s involvement in the event Wallace is hosting Tuesday.\n\nSuzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution said in a statement to The Washington Post she \u201cwould never knowingly engage with the Mujahideen-e Khalq, a cultlike terrorist organization that is despised by many Iranians.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the summit and the diaspora event will be held on separate days, the overlap in the sponsorship of the two events was too close for my comfort,\u201d she said\n\nPompeo has previously distanced himself from the group when asked about the attendance of Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and former national security adviser John Bolton at MEK events. The group offers generous speaking fees and has cultivated close connections in Washington among Democrats and Republicans, including former senator Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) and former Vermont governor Howard Dean (D).\n\n\u201cLet's not beat around the bush,\u201d Pompeo reportedly said during a meeting with Iranian American leaders in April. \u201cAmbassador Bolton spoke at an MEK rally. President Trump and I have not.\u201d\n\nA senior State Department official dismissed the concerns about the MEK\u2019s participation in Wallace\u2019s event, saying, \u201cHave you looked at the people attending the U. N.?\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his decision to include the MEK, a spokesman for Wallace said he \u201cdecided early on that the convention will not discriminate or make value judgments on participation.\u201d\n\nHis spokesman, Joshua Silberberg, added that Wallace\u2019s organization, United Against Nuclear Iran, \u201cadmires Suzanne Maloney and respects her decision about participating in the Iran summit on Wednesday, which is an unrelated event.\u201d\n\nAli Safavi, an official with the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which speaks for the MEK, said Maloney \u201chas no credibility whatsoever to comment on the MEK.\u201d\n\nAs diplomats from around the world streamed into New York for the U.N.\u2019s 74th annual general assembly, Pompeo and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif continued to trade barbs.\n\nPompeo, going further than Trump in assigning blame for the attack on Saudi Arabia, said, \u201cthis was an attack by Iran on the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a diplomatic resolution to this, unlike the Iranians,\u201d he told CBS.\n\nUnlike Pompeo, Trump has not directly blamed the country for the assault, saying last week that \u201cas soon as we find out definitively, we\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nTrump did, however, approve new sanctions on Iran\u2019s state bank on Friday and signed off on a new deployment of U.S. troops to the Middle East to enhance Saudi Arabia\u2019s air defenses.\n\nWith those moves, Iran's foreign minister told reporters that Trump \u201cknowingly or unknowingly on Friday closed the door to negotiations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it's all going the wrong direction in addressing this issue,\u201d Zarif told CBS on Sunday. \u201cI don't think this type of posturing helps.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials said the Trump administration would try to build a coalition to denounce Iran\u2019s activities in the Middle East this week. Rebels in Yemen, known as Houthis, took responsibility for the strike on Saudi oil facilities, but Pompeo and Saudi Arabia have said the militants do not possess the type of drone and cruise missile weaponry used in the attack. Even some Democrats reluctant to embrace Trump\u2019s messaging have rejected Iran\u2019s denial of involvement, including former Secretary of State John Kerry, who said Iran was responsible \u201cone way or the other.\u201d\n\nIn an acknowledgment of the worsening tensions, France\u2019s top diplomat, who has tried to broker a meeting between Rouhani and Trump, said it was now more important to de-escalate the \u201cdangerous\u201d situation rather than set up a meeting between the two government.\n\n\u201cWhat is at stake during this week is whether or not we can carry on with this de-escalation process,\u201d Jean-Yves Le Drian said.\n\nCarol Morello contributed to this report.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s involvement in an event sponsored by a prominent Iran hawk is complicating the U.S. message, analysts say.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jC2mSa2qtUcmxOmoUUhPYpUzEXk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HSY3B6G6DQI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
