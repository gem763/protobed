The officers, who were originally charged with rape, sexual assault and kidnapping, pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree bribe receiving and nine counts of official misconduct.\n\nOn the original charges, Martins and Hall had faced up to 25 years in prison. With the plea deal, they faced a maximum of seven years.\n\n\u201cThese defendants engaged in a shocking abuse of power which they finally acknowledged,\u201d Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a Thursday statement. \u201cWhile I would have preferred to see them serve prison time, they are no longer members of our police department and with today\u2019s plea are convicted felons.\u201d\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office pushed for the former officers to serve a one- to three-year jail term, but the sentence was handed down by Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun without prosecutors\u2019 input.\n\nThe accuser\u2019s attorney Michael David said in a statement to Gothamist that he and his client are \u201coutraged\u201d by the judge\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re arrested and kidnapped in a van with two large officers with guns, there\u2019s no consent,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting away with rape. It sends a horrible message to victims of police sexual misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe original rape and kidnapping charges were dropped earlier this year after the Brooklyn District Attorney\u2019s Office cited \u201cserious credibility issues\u201d with the accuser, who goes by the pseudonym Anna Chambers to protect her identity. A rape kit, however, showed a positive DNA match with the accused men\u2019s saliva and semen found on Chambers\u2019 body after the alleged attack.\n\nBoth Martins and Hall admitted to having sex with Chambers, but defense attorneys argued that the sex was consensual. At the time, it was not illegal for police officers to have sex with someone in custody \u2015 although that has since changed, in part because of this case.\n\nChambers told investigators in September 2017 that Martins and Hall pulled her over while she was driving with two male friends near Coney Island in Brooklyn. She said the two detectives found marijuana in her car and told her she was being arrested. Chambers said Martins and Hall let her two friends go, arrested her and drove away with her in an unmarked police van.\n\nShe alleged that Martins and Hall forced her to perform oral sex before they took turns raping her in the van. Afterward, she said, she went to a local medical center to report the rape and get a rape kit done. Martins and Hall resigned from the police department shortly after they were accused of rape and kidnapping.", "description": "\"They're getting away with rape,\" the accuser's attorney said.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0135eb1700002c0179632d.jpeg?cache=coag1vriuw&ops=1778_1000"}
