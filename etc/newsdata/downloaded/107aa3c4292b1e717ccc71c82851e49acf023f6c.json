We always believed that the game would go ahead.\"\n\nTownsend added: \"It's always a good indication of where the players are with energy when they start and they started well, and then we made a couple of errors, and we gave Japan the ball and they made the most of that.\n\n\"I'm proud of the effort, but we need to be more accurate in the final 20 minutes. We had an opportunity to win tonight and we didn't take it.\"\n\nTownsend praise the Japan team as a \"very cohesive group\".\n\n\"You can tell they've been together for a long time and they know the game they play, they play to their strengths... a fast game.\n\n\"They have some really good players, ball-carriers in the forwards and some players (in the backs) with real pace and confidence right now.\"\n\nJapan play South Africa next weekend and Townsend predicted a tough battle for the two-time champion Springboks.\n\n\"They'll be a tough team to beat, that'll be a tough game for South Africa,\" he said.\n\nScotland skipper Greg Laidlaw insisted that Japan had \"never caught us off-guard as such\".\n\n\"We started the game fairly well, switched off and let Japan into the game.\n\n\"We're disappointed as a group because we had aspirations. They scored 28 points against us tonight and we've got to take that on the chin.\"", "description": "Japan are a quality side that will be very tough to beat at the Rugby World Cup, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said after his side crashed out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7921/826512a5b79c4439a639c17029bc7514.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
