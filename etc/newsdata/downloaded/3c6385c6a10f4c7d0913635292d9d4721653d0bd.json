This was 40 per cent longer than Londoners, who were in second place on four minutes 49 seconds. The shortest calls were in Bradford at an average of three minutes and 15 seconds.\n\nA spokesman said: 'Overall, the number of minutes people spend on mobile calls has risen steadily in recent years.\n\n'But Ofcom's previous studies have also showed that younger people find making calls daunting, and prefer to use messaging services such as WhatsApp.\n\n'And our new research reveals a quarter of people made less than five mobile calls a month, with 6 per cent of people not making any standard mobile calls at all. Of those who did pick up the phone, almost two-thirds ended the call in less than 90 seconds.'", "description": "One in four of us make fewer than five mobile calls a month, and one in 17 - six per cent - make none at all, according to research used by the telecoms industry regulator Ofcom.", "authors": ["Sean Poulter Consumer Affairs Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/00/19516290-0-image-a-61_1570662806360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
