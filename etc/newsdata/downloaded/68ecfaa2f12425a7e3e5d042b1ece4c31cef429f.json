Top holdings include Procter & Gamble PG, +0.55%, TJX Cos. TJX, -0.39% and Mastercard MA, +1.44%.\n\nSome investors have given up on actively managed mutual funds because most trail the performance of low-cost index funds and ETFs. Even Berkshire Hathaway, BRK.B, +0.93%, led by CEO Warren Buffett, has underperformed recently. Still, many long-term active strategies that have underperformed over the past 10 or 15 years have measured up well for longer periods.\n\nThe Jensen Quality Growth Fund JENSX, +0.80% has avoided that problem. Here\u2019s a comparison of the fund\u2019s average annual returns (after expenses) over long periods to those of the fund\u2019s benchmark, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.80% :\n\nAverage return - 3 years Average return - 5 years Average return - 10 years Average return - 15 years Average return - 20 years Jensen Quality Growth Fund 14.7% 12.9% 13.3% 9.2% 8.4% S&P 500 Index 13.4% 10.6% 13.3% 9.0% 6.3% Source: FactSet\n\nSo the fund has outperformed the index for all the listed periods except for 10 years \u2014 a tie.\n\nThe fund holds 29 stocks and is owned by Lake Oswego, Ore.-based Jensen Investment Management, which has $9.6 billion in assets under management. McIver is a managing director of the firm and part of a team of six portfolio managers for Jensen Quality Growth.\n\nIn an interview, McIver said: \u201cWe have had clients and prospects talking about Jensen as being a boring strategy, but in the destabilized political and economic environment, as an investment manager selecting quality stocks, we feel particularly comfortable.\u201d\n\nQuality selection\n\nMcIver said the average holding period for stocks in the Jensen Quality Growth Fund is seven years.\n\nThe fund\u2019s managers and analysts narrow the universe of about 4,400 U.S.-listed stocks to about 230 companies that have achieved returns on equity (ROE) of at least 15% for each of the past 10 years. If a company\u2019s ROE drops below that threshold, the Jensen team will sell the stock.\n\nJensen sold its shares of Praxair, which was acquired by Linde LIN, +0.29% in October 2018, because McIver and his colleagues had determined the combined company\u2019s ROE would be less than 15%.\n\nThen the team goes through what McIver called a process to consider \u201cbusiness risk\u201d and \u201cpricing risk\u201d when selecting companies for possible investment. Those processes are also ongoing for stocks within the portfolio.\n\nHe emphasized the advantages of \u201call-weather businesses\u201d with \u201cdurable competitive advantages\u201d and high cash-flow generation, to go along with the high ROE.\n\n\u201cWe look for those companies to invest that cash for growth,\u201d he said.\n\nMicrosoft MSFT, +1.21%, the largest holding of the fund, is an example of an all-weather business, McIver said. Jensen first bought shares of the company in 2005, McIver said, \u201cwhen it was well out of favor.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Jensen\u2019s managers found the company\u2019s free-cash-flow generation \u201ccompelling,\u201d he said. Fast forward to 2019 and he still believes there\u2019s an excellent business case for Microsoft because of the continuing drive for businesses to become more efficient. He also believes there is still \u201ca very long runway\u201d for the company to expand its cloud-based subscription service model.\n\nWhen discussing pricing risk, McIver pointed to a recent sale of Coca-Cola KO, +1.43%, because the company\u2019s share price had exceeded the Jensen team\u2019s estimate of its \u201cfull value.\u201d The firm had held shares of Coke since 1992.\n\nTwo long-term holdings McIver mentioned were Mastercard and TJX. He said Mastercard has been more profitable than its rival payment processor Visa V, +1.79%, and that this is the type of financial-services company he prefers to invest in, because there is no credit risk. The fund doesn\u2019t hold any bank stocks.\n\nFor TJX, McIver praised the company\u2019s \u201ctreasure-hunt appeal\u201d for middle-class U.S. consumers because of the ever-changing product lineups in its TJ Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls stores.\n\nTwo recent purchases\n\nMcIver said Jensen had recently purchased shares of Broadridge Financial Solutions BR, +0.03%, which is a good example of a company with an \u201call-weather\u201d business model. The company specializes in corporate-communications services, including managing proxy voting, annual reports and trade processing.\n\nJensen Investment Management Rob McIver, a managing director and portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.\n\n\u201cWhat we find attractive about this business it is immune to market volatility,\u201d McIver said. \u201cProxy activities have to take place as a matter of course.\u201d\n\nHe added that Broadridge\u2019s minimum ROE over the past 10 full years was 32%, making for an \u201cincredibly profitable business.\u201d The company\u2019s average annual revenue growth over the past five years has been 12%, with earnings-per-share growth of 17%, he said.\n\nJensen also made a recent initial purchase of VF Corp. VFC, +0.53% shares. The company is best known for its North Face outdoor brand and Vans footwear brand. McIver said he was impressed with VF\u2019s \u201cbrand management,\u201d including its decision to spin off Kontoor Brands KTB, +1.90%, which holds the Wrangler and Lee brands.\n\nJensen doesn\u2019t hold shares of Kontoor because the spun-off company didn\u2019t meet its ROE requirement.\n\nMcIver said VF is a \u201cslower-growing company,\u201d in part because of the Kontoor spinoff, but that it was also a stable business, \u201cgiven the volatility of the market.\u201d VF\u2019s five-year annualized sales growth has been 2.5%, with EPS increasing 3.5%, he said. The 10-year figures look better, with average annual sales growth of 6.7% and EPS growth of 11.5%, he added.\n\nTop holdings\n\nJensen published the entire list of holdings for the Jensen Quality Growth Fund as of Aug 5. At that time, the fund was 4% invested in cash and equivalents.
