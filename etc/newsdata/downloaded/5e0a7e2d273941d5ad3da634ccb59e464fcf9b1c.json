(Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images)\n\nIf Gerrit Cole is pitching, the Houston Astros are winning.\n\nThat was the story going into Game 3 of the American League Championship Series, and that\u2019s the story coming out after the overpowering right-hander subdued the New York Yankees bats in a 4-1 victory.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Astros now lead the series 2-1 and will have a chance to take firm control with another win on Wednesday.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite the dominant effort we saw from Cole in the ALDS, where he struck out 25 Tampa Bay Rays in his two outings. New York actually seemed close to solving him on several occasions. The Yankees loaded the bases with two outs in the first inning, but failed to capitalize. The Yankees then put two runners on base in each of the second, fourth and fifth innings, but never got a breakthrough hit.\n\nCole walked a season-high five batters, allowed four hits and struck out seven over his seven innings. He survived by getting outs when he needed them most. The Yankees went 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position against Cole and stranded nine baserunners.\n\nYankees starter Luis Severino lasted 4 1/3 innings, which was a mild surprise given the Astros fast start. Jose Altuve hit a first-inning homer on the third pitch of the game. The Astros kept trying to get more runs across in the first, getting the bases loaded against Severino before he was able to escape. In the second inning, Josh Reddick hit a massive second-deck homer off Severino to lead off the inning.\n\nThe Yankees right-hander has pitched beyond five innings only one time in eight postseason starts.\n\nStory continues\n\nHouston tacked on a pair of insurance runs in the seventh inning against Adam Ottavino and Zack Britton. Jose Altuve scored on a wild pitch before Yuli Gurriel\u2019s sac fly. New York got on the board on Gleyber Torres\u2019 home run in the eighth inning, but Will Harris and Roberto Osuna were able to close the door and secure the victory.\n\nWHO MADE THE DIFFERENCE\n\n\u2022 Gerrit Cole: It was a grind for Cole, but the end results are every bit as impressive as his previous postseason outings. The Yankees were aggressive at times, but were also capable of extending at-bats. Aaron Hicks notably worked a 10-pitch walk to set up a scoring opportunity in the second inning. Cole answered every challenge and then finished strong by retiring the final seven batters he faced.\n\n\u2022 Jose Altuve: With his first-inning home run, Altuve put his name in the same category as some of MLB\u2019s greatest postseason players.\n\nToday is Jose Altuve's 40th career postseason game. He just hit his 12th career postseason HR.\n\n\n\nHere are the only players with MORE HR in their 1st 40 career postseason games:\n\n\n\nNelson Cruz -- 16\n\nCarlos Beltran -- 16\n\nBabe Ruth -- 15\n\nMickey Mantle -- 13 \u2014 Sarah Langs (@SlangsOnSports) October 15, 2019\n\nWhen you\u2019re mentioned in the same breath as Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, you\u2019re doing something right.\n\nThe former AL MVP added a beautifully executed hit-and-run single to spark Houston\u2019s seventh-inning rally.\n\n\u2022 Gleyber Torres: Even in a losing effort, Torres remained red hot. The 22-year-old launched his third home run of the postseason to provide New York\u2019s only run. He\u2019s on the same postseason home run pace as Altuve, who\u2019s already the all-time leader among second basemen.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nHow close were the Yankees to turning this game around against Gerrit Cole in the fifth inning?\n\nThis close.\n\n\"Give us back the other balls\" - Yankee fans\n\n\n\n(via @MLBonFox) pic.twitter.com/rBztC7bHku \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 15, 2019\n\nWHAT THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nCan the Yankees bats get back on track now that they\u2019ve passed the Justin Verlander-Gerrit Cole portion of Houston\u2019s rotation? After scoring seven runs in their Game 1 victory against Zack Greinke and company, the Yankees have been limited to three total runs in Game 2 and 3. We don\u2019t know yet who will pitch Game 4 for either team, but it feels like New York\u2019s offense needs a big bounce back performance to keep this series from slipping away.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nThe series continues with Game 4 on Wednesday night. First pitch is scheduled for 7:08 p.m. ET. Neither team has announced an official starter for tomorrow going into Game 3. It\u2019s expected the Yankees will use an opener and ride the bullpen. More information should be available shortly.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Astros defeated the Yankees 4-1 in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series.
