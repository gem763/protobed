They say he raised no concerns about the foetus's health.\n\nHowever the mum then reportedly had a fourth 5D ultrasound at a different clinic while six months pregnant.\n\nThat scan raised the issue of possible abnormalities but Dr Carvalho dismissed concerns.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"He explained that sometimes some parts of the face are not visible (on ultrasounds)... when the baby's face is glued to the belly of the mother,\" Rodrigo's aunt was quoted by AFP as telling a local broadcaster.\n\nAfter Rodrigo's birth and his abnormalities became clear, his parents were reportedly told he would only survive for hours.\n\nBut more than two weeks on the boy is still alive under hospital care.\n\nHis parents have reportedly submitted a complaint about Dr Carvalho to the Portuguese Prosecutors' Office.\n\nIt has been reported that at least six medical complaints are currently open against him, dating back to 2013.\n\nOther parents have come forward to share their personal stories with Portuguese media of Dr Carvalho's alleged failure to detect health issues in their own pregnancies.\n\nIn one case a baby was born in 2011 with a facial disfigurement, deformed legs and severe brain damage.\n\nMum Laura Afonso told Publico newspaper she had submitted a criminal complaint against the doctor only for a prosecutor to dismiss it.\n\nNow eight, her child had had multiple surgeries but still could not speak or walk, she said.\n\nIn a different case linked to the same doctor the child died months after their 2007 birth. But it was also reportedly dismissed without reaching trial, Publico reports.\n\nMiguel Guimar\u00e3es, president of Portugal's medical association (Ordem dos M\u00e9dicos), said he had directly contacted Dr Carvalho, given the \"social alarm\" caused by the case.\n\nThe doctor, he said, had agreed to stop performing procedures while investigations continued.\n\nThe body's disciplinary council then met earlier this week and unanimously agreed Dr Carvalho should be suspended for six months while investigations continued.", "description": "Baby Rodrigo was born at S\u00e3o Bernardo Hospital in Set\u00fabal missing a nose, eyes or part of his skull but the parents had had no warning about the abnormalities", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16243903.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_Hands-of-newborn-baby-and-mother.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
