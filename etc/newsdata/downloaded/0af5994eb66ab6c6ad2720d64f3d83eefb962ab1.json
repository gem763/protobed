So, it\u2019s understandable if you can\u2019t resist offering your kids advice when they\u2019re looking for work. But if you base your tips on your own decades-old job search experiences, you risk doing more harm than good.\n\nMany of the historic norms surrounding the job hunt \u2014 like interview attire, the \u201cbest\u201d places to work and the perils of job-hopping \u2014 no longer hold. A recent viral tweet suggested that it would make a comical reality show if boomers followed their own 30-year-old job-search advice.\n\nTo bring you up to speed, avoid the wrath of your millennial children and help you find a job yourself, I turned to two sets of experts. First, I asked my daughter Juliana and a few of her classmates at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business to share the outdated job-search advice they\u2019ve received from their parents. Then, I asked my career-coaching colleagues to weigh in on useful advice to tell your kids.\n\nHere are four dated job-search tips some boomers give their millennial kids and the updated advice (from the M.B.A. students, other career coaches and me) that\u2019s much better:\n\nOutdated Tip No. 1: Don\u2019t be a job-hopper. You need to stay at a job at least a few years (even if you\u2019re miserable) to be an attractive candidate for future employers.\n\nUpdated Advice: \u201cRecruiters are still skeptical of job-hoppers,\u201d advises Thea Kelly, a career coach and author of \u201cGet That Job! A Quick and Complete Guide to a Winning Interview.\u201d \u201cBut what that term means varies according to the person\u2019s age and occupation.\u201d For example, it\u2019s more acceptable to move around in certain professions like sales, than in professions like law and architecture.\n\nAlso, whether you\u2019re considered a job-hopper depends partly on your reasons for making a move.\n\n\u201cRepeatedly moving to higher levels of responsibility looks a lot better than moving around in an aimless way, as if you have trouble fitting in or don\u2019t know what you want,\u201d says Kelly. Indeed, recruiters recognize that making frequent moves can sometimes provide a boost to your career. \u201cIt can give you a broader perspective on your industry, your occupation and yourself,\u201d says Kelly.\n\nBut staying put also has its advantages. So, remind your kids that sometimes it\u2019s best to tough out a job for a while. A 2017 study of millennial employees by workplace culture consultancy O.C. Tanner found a strong association between how many jobs they had and their level of discontent with their company.\n\nSerial job-hopping can become a destructive cycle, where you leave because you feel underappreciated, but never stay long enough to connect with management and advance.\n\nOutdated Tip No. 2: You can\u2019t dress too nicely for an interview.\n\nUpdated Advice: That old saw simply doesn\u2019t cut it anymore. The young M.B.A.s I talked to said dressing up for work doesn\u2019t apply in many industries these days. So, looking buttoned-up in an interview could be a turnoff for a casual employer, suggesting you don\u2019t understand its culture.\n\nJob-search and resum\u00e9 specialist Virginia Franco says: Dress just a bit nicer than what a prospective employer\u2019s workers typically wear. For example, if jeans and T-shirts are the norm, men who are interviewing might opt for nice slacks and a polo shirt and women could go with a casual dress.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Cut these 5 outdated things from your resume\n\nDo your research before you show up to meet with the interviewer. Look over the employer\u2019s website to determine the level of formality in its workplace. And consider the industry: If you\u2019re looking for a corporate position in finance or law, it\u2019s typically best to wear formal business attire. For men, this means a conservative looking suit and tie. For women, it means a tailored dress, pantsuit or skirt suit.\n\nOutdated Tip No. 3: Always take the safest or best-paid offer. It\u2019s better to go with an established company than a \u201crisky\u201d startup.\n\nUpdated Advice: My daughter said: \u201cLots of \u2018safe\u2019 companies can also go through massive layoffs and hard times. Look at AIG and Lehman Brothers and GM.\u201d And, she said, for younger people: \u201cTaking a lower-paid or riskier role can mean you take on more responsibility early in your career. This can translate into better opportunities down the road, instead of taking the entry-level role at a blue-chip company.\u201d\n\nWatch: Millennials Job-Hopping: Money Isn\u2019t the Problem\n\nJob-search strategist Hannah Morgan of CareerSherpa.net agrees. \u201cEvery opportunity is risky in today\u2019s world of work,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, working for a startup can be risky, but it can also result in gaining a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Startups are often high-risk and high-reward, and what they lack in salary may be made up for with stock options. It could be a career-defining opportunity, so don\u2019t dismiss it without thorough research.\u201d\n\nI want to add two caveats to Morgan\u2019s advice:\n\nFirst, the long hours and fast-paced startup environment can be grueling. So, job seekers need to be honest with themselves about their lifestyle before making a commitment. Not everyone is temperamentally suited for life at a startup.\n\nSecond, for young people, an established company that offers training, a 401(k), opportunities for advancement and an impressive name can provide useful boosts. Remember to point out those benefits to your child if he or she is deciding between competing offers.\n\nOutdated Tip No. 4: Be sure to \u201csell yourself\u201d in the interview.\n\nUpdated Advice: \u201cPlease stop telling your kids this,\u201d says Steve Dalton, program director for daytime career services at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business and author of \u201cThe 2-Hour Job Search: Using Technology to Get the Right Job Faster.\u201d \u201cNobody likes doing it and nobody likes being sold to. It baffles me why that advice sticks around.\n\nAlso see: This 29-year-old just boosted her salary by $22,000 \u2014 here\u2019s how she did it\n\nInstead, Dalton believes it\u2019s far better to demonstrate strong listening and learning skills during the interview. In other words, do your homework about the employer and share what you know; ask smart questions and be an active listener, responding to new information you hear from the interviewer.\n\nAs Dalton told my Next Avenue colleague Kerry Hannon in her \u201cHow to Job Hunt if You Haven\u2019t in Years\u201d post, \u201cWhen you embrace the humbling process of no longer selling yourself and instead dedicate yourself to listening, you will get so far, so quickly.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like timeless job-search advice to me, no matter your age.", "description": "Many of the historic norms surrounding the\u00a0job hunt \u2014 like interview attire \u2014\u00a0no longer hold.", "authors": ["Nancy Collamer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ694_nerd_o_ZG_20190904143037.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
