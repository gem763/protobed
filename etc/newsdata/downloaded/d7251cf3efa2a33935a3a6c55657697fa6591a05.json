Meanwhile, house prices are barely rising and the increase in costs is not being offset.\n\nBarratt is trading at a big premium to many of its rivals, including Bellway, which yesterday said its margin had fallen 21 per cent from 22.1 per cent in the most recent financial year.\n\nShares in Barratt, which were at a two-year high on Tuesday, fell by almost 2.7 per cent to 664.8p on Wednesday morning.", "description": "The developer finished more than 3,250 homes in the last 15 weeks and is due to sell nearly 13,000 for more than \u00a33 billion over the financial year.", "authors": ["Press Association", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
