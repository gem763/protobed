Watt out for rest of NFL season after injury", "language": "en", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nEven with a victory, the Houston Texans' push for a playoff berth took a significant hit on Sunday.\n\nFive-time all-pro defensive end J.J. Watt confirmed he suffered a season-ending injury in a 27-24 win over the Oakland Raiders. Multiple reports indicated Watt had suffered a torn pectoral injury.\n\nIt marks the third time in four seasons that Watt has had his season cut short by injury.\n\n\"This game can be beautiful and it can also be brutal,\" Watt wrote on Twitter. \"Absolutely gutted that I won\u2019t be able to finish the season with my guys and give the fans what they deserve. I truly love this game and can\u2019t stand letting you guys down. Thank you for all of the thoughts & well-wishes.\"\n\nWatt left Sunday's game in the second quarter and was taken to the hospital for an MRI, Texans coach Bill O'Brien confirmed after the game.\n\nThe injury to the three-time defensive player of the year and key team leader marks a significant blow for Houston's defense. Watt ranks second on the team in sacks with four but entered the week leading the NFL in quarterback hits with 20. His pressure helped provide relief for a pass defense that has been under fire in 2019.\n\nWatt returned to his all-pro form last season by recording 16 sacks in his first full campaign since playing just eight games the two previous years due to back injuries and a tibial plateau fracture.\n\nThe Texans (5-3) are a half-game behind the Indianapolis Colts (5-2) in the AFC South but lost the first meeting between the two teams last week.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "description": "The Houston Texans' postseason push just got more difficult, as the team confirmed J.J.
