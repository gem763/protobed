I mean that seriously.\n\n\"A bit silly to say, but I really think so.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nVan der Vaart previously said Maguire was \"the worst player on the pitch\" when England were beaten 3-1 by Holland in the UEFA Nations League in June.\n\nThe former midfielder-turned-darts player told Sky Sports: \u201cIt\u2019s funny because during the Nations League, I was doing work for Dutch television.\n\n\u201cAnd I remember we were saying \u2018Harry Maguire was by far the worst player on the pitch\u2019.\n\n\u201c\"And then two months later, \u00a380-\u00a390m? Unbelievable.\"\n\nUnited signed Maguire from Leicester this summer for \u00a380m - a world-record fee for a defender which eclipsed the previous mark of \u00a375m which Liverpool paid for Van Dijk.", "description": "If United defender is worth \u00a380m then Virgil van Dijk is worth \u00a3300m, says former Tottenham striker", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663003.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-Premier-League-Old-Trafford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
