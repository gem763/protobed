Cheese from nearly every EU country will be hit with the 25 per cent tariffs, but Italian wine and olive oil were spared, along with European chocolate.\n\nHarvest at the Chateau La Dominique vineyards in Pomerol, France. French wine has been caught up in the latest EU-US tariff spat. Bloomberg\n\nThe size and scope of the tariffs were reduced considerably from a $US25 billion list floated by Washington earlier this year that included helicopters, major aircraft components, seafood, luxury goods and other big-ticket categories that were excluded from Wednesday's announcement.\n\nOne person familiar with the case said the USTR was deliberately not using the full extent of WTO-approved retaliation to coax the EU to the negotiating table.\n\nBut it came with an explicit warning.\n\n\"The US has the authority to increase the tariffs at any time, or change the products affected. USTR will continually re-evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the EU,\" the USTR said.\n\nThe USTR has sought WTO ratification of its tariff list by October 14. The duties could come into force just three days after a scheduled October 15 tariff increase on $US250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 30 per cent from 25 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Washington and Beijing try to ease their bitter 15-month trade war, the US-EU trade spat looks set to worsen.\n\nAirbus spokesman Clay McConnell said the France-based planemaker was evaluating the list and its possible consequences in \"close collaboration with the European Commission\".\n\nThe WTO, he said, in coming months would grant the EU authority to impose tariffs on US goods over its findings of illegal subsidies for Boeing from Washington state that could equal or exceed the US tariffs.\n\n\"Airbus considers that the only way to prevent the negative effects that these countermeasures would create will be for the US and EU to find a resolution to this long-running dispute through a negotiated settlement before the tariffs become effective,\" he said.\n\nIn their decision, WTO arbitrators said Boeing had lost the equivalent of $US7.5 billion a year in sales and disruption to deliveries of some of its largest aircraft because of cheap European government loans to Airbus.\n\nThe decision, confirming a figure reported by Reuters last week, allows Washington to target the same value of EU goods but bars any retaliation against European financial services.\n\nAt list prices from $US92 million for an A319 jetliner to some $US366.5 million for an A350-1000 widebody, the 10 per cent Airbus tariff could impose severe financial burdens on US airline customers. Delta Air Lines said it has about 170 Airbus planes on order that could be affected.\n\n\"Aircraft are significant purchases requiring long lead times for production - often years in advance,\" Delta said in a statement. \"Imposing tariffs on aircraft that US companies have already committed to will inflict serious harm on US airlines, the millions of Americans they employ and the traveling public.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBroad selling amid worries over slowing global growth that punished European stocks earlier on Wednesday accelerated as the ruling revived worries about damage to the already-ailing European economy. The pan European STOXX 600 index finished down 2.7 per cent, its worst day since December 2018. Airbus shares closed down 2 per cent.\n\nWall Street's main indices suffered their sharpest one-day declines in nearly six weeks after employment and manufacturing data suggested the US-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the US economy.\n\nAirbus and Boeing, the world's two largest planemakers, have waged a war of attrition over subsidies at the WTO since 2004 in a dispute that has tested the trade policeman's influence and is expected to set the tone for competition from would-be rivals from China.\n\nThe WTO had already found that both Airbus and Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in the world's largest corporate trade dispute. The global trade body is due to decide early next year on the level of annual tariffs the EU can impose on US imports.\n\nWhile the level of tariffs amounts to less than three days' worth of trade between Europe and the United States, importers led by US airlines that buy Airbus jets have urged Washington to be selective when choosing industries to hit in order to avoid causing collateral damage to the US economy.\n\nEU manufacturers are already facing US tariffs on steel and aluminum and a threat from US President Donald Trump to penalise EU cars and car parts. The EU has in turn retaliated.\n\nThe Trump administration believes tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to US products.\n\nReuters", "description": "The World Trade Organisation gave Washington a green light to impose tariffs on $11.2 billion worth of EU goods annually.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6164%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1176%2C$y_525/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/42ff63e1a38d37832cb8f53837c2c12afeb10ba1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
