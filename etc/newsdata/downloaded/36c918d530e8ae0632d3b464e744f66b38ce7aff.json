Their efforts have been in vain for the most part because, outside of hyper-controlled environments, entry-level gaming setups like Lenovo\u2019s Mirage AR are both too sensitive and not sophisticated enough to create the kind of fully-immersive experience that promotional materials promise.\n\nLenovo\u2019s hoping that a splashy new Avengers-themed game, featuring characters like Captain Marvel and the Black Panther, will be more than enough to convince folks to drop around $365 on two-year old technology that we weren\u2019t exactly hot about when we first got our hands on it.\n\nWhile there are certainly a few aspects of the game that\u2019ll make you smile (when they actually work), Marvel Dimension of Heroes inadvertently highlights how developers still haven\u2019t really figured out how to take these kinds of applications of AR and turn them into reliably solid gaming experiences that feel fully thought-out.\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent any time playing Disney\u2019s Star Wars: Jedi Challenges, the Marvel Dimension of Heroes\u2019 hardware components and the way the you have to set everything up will be familiar. Included with the AR headset itself, the kit provides you with a beacon that acts as the focal-point for game play, and two motion-sensing controllers that transform your hands into those of whichever Avengers you\u2019ve decided to play as.\n\nAfter downloading the companion application onto your iPhone or Android device, all one should have to do in theory is slide it into the headset with the accompanying safety-tray, strap it on, and begin playing, but in reality, the process is something of a hassle that immediately sets a less-than-great tone for the experience you\u2019re about to subject yourself to.\n\nBecause little has seemingly changed about the underlying technology Lenovo\u2019s offering, the process of setting the hardware up to play the game is as frustratingly-tedious as ever.\n\nEven though the actual game itself lives within your phone, Lenovo\u2019s headset has to be charged via USB if you have any hopes of using the thing, which has the potential of taking the wind out of the sales of people who rip open the packaging hoping to immediately dive into gameplay.\n\nEach of the two controllers requires two double-a batteries (which are blessedly included), as does the beacon, which must be set up in a reasonably-open space for people to be able to move in. Nothing about the set-up process is especially complicated, but it\u2019s difficult not to get the sense that you\u2019re fiddling with dated technology that doesn\u2019t feel \u201cright\u201d in 2019.\n\nBecause the game relies on using your phone, one would imagine that the headset would be configured in such a way that it would be compatible with as wide a variety of devices as possible, and yet when I tried inserting my iPhone XR into the headset, the thing simply wouldn\u2019t fit.\n\nObviously, the XR wasn\u2019t on the market when Lenovo first put the Mirage out in 2017. But given how the device quickly became Apple\u2019s best-selling phone last year, it seems odd that the manufacturer would push the AR experience knowing that a sizable chunk of people\u2019s devices straight-up wouldn\u2019t work with it.\n\nUltimately, I ended up using an older iPhone X model that fit into the headset fine for the most part, but as I strapped the thing onto my face to begin calibrating the controllers and getting into gameplay, it became obvious that Marvel Dimension of Heroes is still a long ways away from being the kind of game that people are going to be clamoring for regardless of whatever phone you\u2019ve got.\n\nTo be honest, the first and most important thing you have to do in order to get into the game is to make sure that you\u2019ve got your phone slotted into the headset damn-near perfectly, otherwise the entire experience ends up effectively borked because you can\u2019t see all of the necessary information that\u2019s being provided on-screen.\n\nWhen the phone needed up being even a little bit crooked, I ended up having to spend way too much time either looking down or looking up because the game couldn\u2019t get a solid sense on where my body was in relation to the beacon, and while I could always take everything off, and adjust things to get them right, doing so was always a hassle.\n\nOnce you actually get into the game, and calibrate the two controllers, you meet a very snazzy-looking Doctor Strange who explains that he needs your help defeating a number of Marvel\u2019s notable villains like Ronan the Accuser and Ultron. Regardless of hero you choose \u2014 Captain America, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Star-Lord, Doctor Strange, or Thor \u2014 gameplay centres around you using both of your hands to perform a variety of unique attacks battle against waves of enemies who zoom into your line of sight on the headset\u2019s reflective display.\n\nWhen the controllers are attuned precisely, simple actions like punching and swiping are easy enough to pull off and when you successfully strike a target, the glowing plastic sticks rumble with a feedback that\u2019s pleasant, but doesn\u2019t quite have an \u201coomph\u201d that makes you feel like you\u2019ve actually touched something. It\u2019s when the controllers begin to get a little wonky that the game becomes an exercise in patience and contorting yourself to make the hardware work for you.\n\nBeyond punching, each of the characters have a bevy of specialised attacks that you can launch by hitting a combination of buttons on the controllers and lifting your arms into various postures.\n\nAgain, those mechanics are pretty straightforward, but because the game has a tendency to forget where your hands are unless you\u2019re constantly holding them up at the ready like a boxer, I repeatedly found that when I tried to unleash a wave of kinetic energy as the Black Panther or to fry a Kree soldier with Captain Marvel\u2019s photon blasts, the game had no idea how to follow along with my movements.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I realised that the game thought that my arms were pointing straight down that I managed to begin zapping baddies regularly, but doing so meant holding my arms at weird, unnatural angles that made me look like a lunatic bobbing and weaving in my living room.\n\nShould you stand with perfect posture with your hands at the ready, you\u2019ve got about a 40/60 chance of Dimension of Heroes working the way it\u2019s meant to. But because the game encourages you to lean and shift your weight around, it\u2019s never too long before you\u2019re looking down at your virtually augmented fists and seeing that they\u2019re impossibly turned around, and unable to actually hit any of the aliens trying to attack you.\n\nIn those rare moments when the game worked mostly as it was meant to, you could see the see how, at one point in time, the Mirage might have been something to get excited about. Surprisingly, navigating the menu system with your entire head feels like the most advanced aspect of the game, because the selection process is as smooth as it is natural and it makes you with that the rest of the game was built around smaller motions that the hardware could actually keep with.\n\nMost damning of all is that, for all of its \u201cfuture tech\u201d trappings, Dimension of Heroes\u2019 actual story and gameplay are simple to the point of sometimes feeling basic which makes you wonder why, exactly, anyone would shell out so much money for it when there are other Avengers-themed video games with much more fleshed-out narratives and controls that lend themselves to actually having fun.\n\nLenovo wants strapping on the Mirage to feel like letting a wave of Wakandan nanotech envelop your head as you train up to become Earth\u2019s next great hero, but both the hardware and the software simply aren\u2019t there. They\u2019re leftover products doing their best to keep up and capitalise on a buzzy-IP, and unfortunately, they just aren\u2019t up to snuff.", "description": "For the past few years, hardware manufacturers and game studios have been valiantly trying to sell the public on the idea of virtual and augmented reality being a core aspect of the future of gaming.
