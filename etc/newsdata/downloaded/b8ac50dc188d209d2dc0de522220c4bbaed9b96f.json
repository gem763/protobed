Production by non-members, mostly private firms, surged 19.4%, according to CISA.\n\nChina has eliminated 140 million tonnes of steel capacity at 700 small mills and 150 million tonnes of inefficient capacity at larger firms in the past four years as part of its environmental crackdown and supply-side reform.", "description": "China's steel industry fragmentation worsening: official", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E0ZH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
