The actress picked up the mic on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and channeled her alter ego, Troublemaker, through a convenient pair of sunglasses. She shouted out the Carters (artists formerly known as Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9) as a little nod to their references to her in \u201cWe Made It\u201d and \u201cBrown Skin Girl,\u201d and then found her flow. \u201cMuch love to Jimmy and the Roots \u2019cause they hot / Wrote a book about self-love / Sulwe \u2019bout to drop October 15th / On time to cop / Better go to commercial or these bars won\u2019t stop,\u201d she rapped effortlessly. We\u2019re hearing Grammys buzz already. At her day job, Nyong\u2019o is starring in zombie comedy Little Monsters with Josh Gad, and her adaptation of Americanah with Danai Gurira just got picked up by HBO Max.
