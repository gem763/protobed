REUTERS/Manaure Quintero\n\nAbout 90% of this shrimp is headed for Europe and Asia - with the blessing of President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s leader has lauded food exports on television as a way to raise hard currency to stabilise an economy in crisis. And he is paving the way for more foreign sales. His administration has loosened restrictions to allow more production to go abroad, 10 food industry entrepreneurs and executives told Reuters.\n\nIn addition to seafood, Venezuelan cheese, avocados, citrus, breakfast cereal and candy are finding international buyers.\n\nThese new foreign sales are tiny, with most companies billing less than $1 million per year. Venezuela remains almost entirely dependent on oil exports, which amounted to $29 billion last year.\n\nStill, the numbers signal a shift for a government that has long blamed the private sector for shortages of basic goods. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, for years accused food companies of hoarding and profiteering. Business leaders say empty shelves were the result of state policies such as price and currency controls and the nationalisation of farms and factories.\n\nSince 2017, 140 Venezuelan businesses have begun exporting for the first time, half of them selling food products, according to data provided by Scottsdale, Arizona-based advisory firm Import Genius, which collects customs data for the import-export industry.\n\nSome veteran exporters, meanwhile, are leaning more heavily than ever on foreign sales as Venezuela\u2019s currency has collapsed. Fernando Villamizar, the head of a Venezuelan shrimp industry association, said the withering of consumer spending power at home has forced producers to look abroad for growth.\n\nOn a recent morning at a facility owned by a member of the trade group, dozens of workers in baggy smocks, plastic gloves and face masks cleaned shellfish and put them in boxes to be frozen. An order that day was bound for France. The plant also ships to Spain and Vietnam.\n\n\u201cWe have to sell outside the country\u201d to survive, Villamizar said.\n\nVenezuelan companies sold $81 million worth of shrimp abroad last year, up from $54 million in 2016, making it the country\u2019s 4th-largest non-oil export, according to figures from the Venezuelan Association of Exporters.\n\nCHEESE SPREAD CROSSES BORDERS\n\nMaduro\u2019s enthusiasm for non-oil exports comes as U.S. sanctions have hurt Venezuela\u2019s petroleum sales. To earn hard currency, his government is scrambling for alternatives.\n\nIn July, Maduro toured a factory outside Caracas that ships chocolate to Japan, television cameras in tow. He said the goal of these and other exports was to generate \u201ceuros, roubles, yuan and cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nFood producers looking to export need to obtain a variety of government permits. Under Chavez, the state frequently denied those permissions, delayed them or never acted on them, the food industry entrepreneurs and executives told Reuters. They said Maduro\u2019s administration is now granting more permits, allowing them room to manoeuvre.\n\nThe Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment on Maduro\u2019s exports strategy.\n\nThe government this year has also largely given up controlling prices, three of the food industry executives said. More goods have returned to Venezuelan stores.\n\nBut even with more products available, Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation means few can afford to buy. Compared to five years ago, the daily calories now consumed by the average citizen have fallen 56% to 1,600 calories, according to Caracas-based Citizenry in Action, a nutrition-focused nonprofit. That is well below the 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day recommended by the World Health Organization. Millions depend on government food handouts and subsidized staples.\n\nLack of demand has spurred two large Venezuelan food companies - Empresas Polar and rival General de Alimentos Nisa CA, or Genica - to export products that until now had only been sold in Venezuela, said two people involved in those operations and a third with knowledge of them.\n\nThe two companies last year exported a combined $59,000 worth of merchandise, mainly to Argentina and Chile. Among the items headed abroad was a once-popular melted cheese spread made by Polar.\n\nGenica told Reuters it was entering new markets, but would not elaborate. Polar did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Venezuelan unit of another major firm, Nestle SA, as of June had exported 18 tonnes of instant cereal worth $18,600 to the United States, according to port records.\n\nConvenience foods are now beyond the reach of Venezuelan shoppers such as Doris Molina, a 28-year-old accountant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give my son cereal anymore because it\u2019s so expensive,\u201d she said, walking with her four-year-old at a Caracas mall. The local price of Nestle\u2019s instant cereal has increased around 3,400% since last year.\n\nNestle said in a statement that its exports generate foreign exchange it needs to acquire raw materials, and that these sales comply with Venezuelan law.\n\nSuch sales do not violate U.S. sanctions, which forbid American firms from doing business with Venezuela\u2019s government or state-run companies such as oil giant Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Venezuela\u2019s private sector companies are free to sell to U.S. buyers.\n\nAttorney Daniel Sanchez opened a fish farm in central Venezuela three years ago to raise tilapia, which is largely unknown in Venezuela. He has buyers in Colombia and is eyeing the United States.\n\nShowing off outdoor tanks teaming with fish, Sanchez said he sells tilapia for $2 a kilogram. That\u2019s the equivalent of more than a week\u2019s pay for Venezuelans earning the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to produce for export,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nRamon Goyo, head of the Venezuela Association of Exporters, said a new company joins his trade group almost weekly to seek advice on how to sell abroad.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking for hope,\u201d Goyo said. \u201cThere\u2019s no (way to make it) in Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation. There\u2019s no spending power.\u201d\n\nExports by Venezuela\u2019s private sector companies increased by 26% in the first quarter of 2019 versus the same period a year ago, even as the economy contracted by 27%, according to the most recent central bank statistics.\n\nBLACKOUTS, TAXES AND FEES\n\nDespite Maduro\u2019s public praise of exporters and loosening of export restrictions, the people interviewed by Reuters say his government still doesn\u2019t make it easy.\n\nThey said needed permits still can be inexplicably denied from one month to the next, while the export of staples such as corn flour and rice remain prohibited.\n\nBusinesses say cash-strapped city and state governments have hiked taxes aimed at exporters, while state-run ports have raised fees.\n\nLocal officials in Maracaibo, Venezuela\u2019s second-largest city, have targeted exporters for bribes, according to three people who told Reuters they have been asked for such payments.\n\nState port agency Bolipuertos did not respond to a request for comment. The city of Maracaibo and the state of Zulia, where Maracaibo is located, did not answer emails seeking comment.\n\nSome companies have snagged foreign customers, only to lose them to the vagaries of Venezuela\u2019s precarious business climate.\n\nFruit processor Venezolana de Frutas C.A., known as Venfruca, three years ago began exporting orange and passion fruit pulp to the Netherlands after Venezuelan demand slumped. The Dutch sales quickly became a crucial source of revenue, according to manager Karolis Laguna, who said the firm has sent 49 container-loads to Europe since 2016.\n\nBut Venfruca this year has struggled to find enough fruit. The Venezuelan farmers it buys from have also figured out exports are profitable; they\u2019re increasingly selling in neighbouring Colombia, Laguna said. An outbreak of mould in Venezuela\u2019s orchards has worsened the shortage, she said.\n\n\u201cWe have purchase orders open because we don\u2019t have raw materials,\u201d Laguna said. She said frequent blackouts at Venfruca\u2019s facility in the western Venezuelan city of Barquisimeto haven\u2019t helped.\n\nDairy firm Bufalinda began selling its mozzarella cheese - made from water buffalo milk - in Florida last year out of an \u201curgent\u201d need to shore up its finances, said Alberto Duhau, founder of the eastern Venezuela firm.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nHe said his air freight costs soared 60% this year after U.S. sanctions blocked direct flights between Venezuela and the United States.\n\nStill, Duhau said his U.S. sales are profitable and he hopes to keep expanding there.\n\n\u201cThis is an endurance race,\u201d Duhau said. \u201cYou can only stay in it if you have a big tank of oxygen.\u201d", "description": "Shrimp farming is booming in this western Venezuelan city, but little of the shellfish is destined for tables in this malnourished nation.", "authors": ["Mayela Armas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444069936&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0SU", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
