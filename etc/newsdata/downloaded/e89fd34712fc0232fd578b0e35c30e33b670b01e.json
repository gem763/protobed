A separate negotiating track to bring down the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan seems similarly stalled.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is making our policy in the Middle East a policy of countering Iran,\u201d said Joshua Landis, who heads the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cHe does want to get us out of these \u2018forever wars.\u2019 You could see it with his push for talks in Afghanistan and now the pullback in Syria. He campaigned on it, and he wants to pump it now for domestic political purposes,\u201d Mr. Landis said. \u201cBut in reality, he\u2019s not getting us out of forever wars because he\u2019s going down the Iran dark hole by sending troops to Saudi Arabia, and it\u2019s going to come back and bite us.\n\n\u201cTrump has basically cornered this lion of Iran, and the lion is not going to sit there peacefully and die of starvation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to lunge out and try to free itself. Iran\u2019s stated policy is to escalate.\u201d\n\nThe administration has tried to downplay that prospect.\n\nThe Pentagon says the increase in troops to Saudi Arabia \u2014 including two fighter squadrons, an air expeditionary wing, a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system and two Patriot missile batteries \u2014 is in response to the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities that the U.S. and its allies blame on Iran.\n\nIn announcing the deployment Friday, officials argued that the goal is to deter, not trigger, a wider clash with Iran.\n\n\u201cThis administration does not seek conflict with Iran,\u201d said Brian Hook, a special representative for Iran. He said the strategy is to use harsh economic pressure and military assets to entice Iran into talks.\n\nA bigger deal\n\nSince Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, administration officials have said the goal is to seek a new deal to contain not only Iran\u2019s nuclear activities but also its ballistic missile programs and support for terrorism and militancy across the region.\n\nThe approach has support from many analysts outside the government including Michael Pregent, a former U.S. intelligence officer who says the administration is well aware of the consequences of escalation and is repositioning American assets to effectively \u201cabsorb\u201d any Iranian attacks.\n\n\u201cThe [Saudi Arabia] deployments are defensive in nature in order to absorb Iran\u2019s attacks and make them less effective ones,\u201d Mr. Pregent, now a fellow with the Hudson Institute, told The Washington Times.\n\nThe question is whether such a strategy collides with Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to bring U.S. forces home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re slowly getting out of the Middle East,\u201d the president told supporters at a campaign rally Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it carefully.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump openly lamented to his core supporters that the U.S. has \u201cspent $8 trillion in the Middle East,\u201d but he made no mention of the new Saudi deployment.\n\nMr. Hook shot back at reporters who asked during a briefing Friday whether the deployment was inconsistent with the president\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a contradiction,\u201d the special envoy said. \u201cThe president has said he is getting us out of endless wars \u2026 endless wars where you have troops engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe troops that we are sending into Saudi and the enhanced assets are defensive,\u201d Mr. Hook said. \u201cThey are there to defend our interests and to help Saudi defend itself. We are not looking for conflict in the Middle East. We have had plenty of it.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper added over the weekend that the Saudi deployment is in America\u2019s national security interest but that the long-term goal is to follow through on the president\u2019s desire to stop \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do have the aspiration to relocate our forces, to move back in certain regions of the world so we can reposition them to deal with the real strategic challenges we face. That is, No. 1, China and, No. 2, Russia,\u201d Mr. Esper told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cWe want to make sure we have sufficient forces on the ground to help defend our partners, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and secondly to deter further Iranian provocative behavior that could lead to a conflict.\u201d\n\nNorth African escalation\n\nEven as Mr. Trump tries to wind down the U.S. military presence, he has quietly presided over an expansion in the war on terror in corners of the wider Middle East, most notably in North Africa.\n\nThe number of American airstrikes against terrorists in Somalia \u2014 including from the al-Shabab network and an Islamic State contingent there \u2014 has increased dramatically over the past three years. U.S. forces conducted 35 airstrikes in Somalia in 2017 and 47 last year. Pentagon figures show 54 strikes so far in 2019.\n\nMilitary officials say privately that the goal in Somalia is not necessarily to eliminate al-Shabab but rather to degrade the group to a point where the Somali federal government can guarantee security for its people.\n\nOfficials have yet to say whether the same goal applies with regard to the Saudi deployment, which brings with it some sensitive implications given the difficult history of American military activity in the kingdom.\n\nU.S. forces were sent to Saudi Arabia during the lead-up to the 1991 Gulf War, but Washington began moving them out in the late 1990s after a series of deadly attacks \u2014 most notably the 1996 terrorist bombing of a housing complex in the Saudi city of Khobar that left 19 U.S. service members dead.\n\nAl Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, himself a Saudi, later cited the U.S. military\u2019s presence in the nation \u2014 and more precisely near the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina \u2014 as a core motivation behind the 9/11 and the Khobar Towers attacks.\n\nMr. Hook pushed aside concern that the current deployment to Saudi Arabia could reignite such jihadi outrage.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really a question that is appropriate for Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said. \u201cSaudi Arabia has requested additional troops and additional assets to help them defend themselves.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Pentagon shifted forces from Saudi Arabia to Al Udeid Air Base in nearby Qatar, which now houses the forward headquarters of U.S. Air Forces Central Command and a combined operations hub for the greater Middle East.\n\nAn unusual exercise at Al Udeid made headlines last month after control of combined operations hub was briefly and deliberately shifted to commanders some 7,000 miles away at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina.\n\nThe Pentagon said the shift was meant to show \u201cresilience\u201d in commanding the hub remotely if necessary, but the exercise triggered speculation that U.S. forces may be considering relocating the hub, possibly to Saudi Arabia.\n\nA senior U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The Times that \u201cthere is definitely consideration on moving more and more troops to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know about consideration on actually putting a base there,\u201d the official said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
