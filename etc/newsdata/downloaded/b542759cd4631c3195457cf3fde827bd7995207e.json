The House Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating the secretary for possible conflicts of interest involving Foremost Group, a New York-based shipping company owned by her father and sisters. Much of the company\u2019s business is centered in China, and the Chao family, The Times reported in June, enjoys \u201can extraordinary proximity to power in China for an American family, marked not only by board memberships in state companies, but also by multiple meetings with the country\u2019s former top leader.\u201d\n\nThe Times noted, \u201cOver the years, Ms. Chao has repeatedly used her connections and celebrity status in China to boost the profile of the company.\u201d In 2017, Ms. Chao\u2019s first official trip to China as a Trump cabinet officer was canceled after ethics concerns about her request to include family members in meetings with Chinese officials were referred to officials in the State and Transportation Departments. The Transportation Department gave no reason for the cancellation at the time, but an official later said the trip conflicted with a scheduled cabinet meeting.\n\nIn a Sept. 16 letter, the oversight committee chairman, Elijah Cummings, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, head of the subcommittee on economic and consumer policy, reminded Ms. Chao that federal regulations prohibit using one\u2019s public office for \u201cthe private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity.\u201d\n\nThe committee is also investigating Ms. Chao\u2019s failure last year to divest herself of stock in Vulcan Materials, a producer of construction materials on whose board she served. Before her confirmation in 2017, Ms. Chao signed an ethics agreement to sell her holdings by April 2018. She did not do so until June of this year, just days after The Wall Street Journal reported on the matter. The secretary\u2019s office blames an error by Ms. Chao\u2019s accountant for the lapse.\n\nThe committee requested that Ms. Chao provide relevant documents and other information by the end of September. The department has for the most part supplied publicly available material, prompting committee Democrats to consider additional action to compel compliance. Ms. Chao\u2019s office has denied any impropriety and said it will turn over information \u201con a rolling basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese false allegations have been hashed over repeatedly in media reports and answered by the department,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cThey are obviously politically motivated.\u201d\n\nMs. Chao has no official affiliation with or stake in Foremost. But she and Mr. McConnell have benefited handsomely from her family\u2019s good fortunes. In 2008, Ms. Chao\u2019s father gave her and her husband somewhere between $5 and $25 million, according to disclosure reports. Her extended family has contributed more than $1 million to Mr. McConnell\u2019s re-election campaigns.", "description": "Congress wants answers from the transportation secretary, wife of the Senate majority leader, about the apparent mixing of public and family business.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/16chao/16chao-facebookJumbo-v8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
