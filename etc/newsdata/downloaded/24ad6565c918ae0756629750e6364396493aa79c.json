In doing so, Twitter said, it \u201cmay have matched people on Twitter\u201d to a marketer\u2019s list \u201cbased on the email or phone number the Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes.\"\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe cannot say with certainty how many people were impacted by this, but in an effort to be transparent, we wanted to make everyone aware,\u201d Twitter said. \u201cNo personal data was ever shared externally with our partners or any other third parties.\u201d\n\nThe incident could invite trouble for Twitter in Washington, where regulators who investigated and penalized Facebook for a series of privacy scandals took issue with its handling of phone numbers. In that case, the Federal Trade Commission alleged Facebook deceived users because it \u201cdid not disclose, or did not adequately disclose\u201d that phone numbers provided through its security tool for the purpose of two-factor authentication \u201calso would be used by Facebook to target advertisements to those users.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAdding to Twitter\u2019s potential troubles, the company finalized an agreement with the FTC in 2011 that alleged the company failed to protect users from security threats. The resulting settlement requires the company to maintain a comprehensive data security policy and refrain from misrepresenting the way it handles and protects users\u2019 data, violations of which could carry fines.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGiven that Facebook got dinged for this exact practice, I think it likely meets the threshold of material omission or even deception under Section 5 on its own, \u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technologist at the FTC, citing the portion of law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts and practices. \u201cThat\u2019s further compounded by the fact that Twitter is also under order already by the FTC.\u201d\n\nTwitter has revealed a number of additional data-security incidents this year. It told users that it may have \u201cinadvertently\u201d collected and shared some location data with an unnamed third-party partner. It also informed users of Twitter\u2019s Android smartphone app that a system issue turned off a setting that made their tweets private. Twitter did not disclose the number of users affected in either instance.\n\nPerhaps the most significant security mishap came in August, however, when Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had his personal account hacked. The move prompted Twitter to disable a feature that allowed users to tweet by text.\n\nAD", "description": "Twitter revealed Tuesday that it mishandled an unspecified number of users' email addresses and phone numbers, allowing that data to be used \"inadvertently\" for advertising purposes.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Vhe_SZAHd1lszYPePNBBwuso3Gk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GZ2GWKHFCQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
