What can the defense of a people's freedom have to do with the patriotism we teach from young children? In schools, in parades, everywhere.'\n\nThe local mayor of the suburb, known as Nea Filadelfia, had earlier termed the girls' move 'pathetic'.\n\nYiannis Vouros said in a Facebook post it 'insulted the memory of those slain' in October 1940 when Greece repulsed an invasion by fascist Italy against overwhelming odds.\n\n'The Ministry of Silly Walks' is a 1970 classic sketch by Monty Python, including Cleese, skewering stiff-necked bureaucracy and self-important inefficiency by walking in an exaggerated and bizarre fashion.\n\nCleese is seen walking through the streets of London, wearing a bowler hat, carrying a briefcase, and lifting his legs high into the air as he passes other Whitehall employees.\n\nThe 10 girls paid homage to to English comedian John Cleese and Monty Python's 1970s 'Ministry of Silly Walks' sketch\n\nThe girls responsible said they were pretending to be insubordinate soldiers and were making a stand against militarism\n\nA video of the march in an Athens suburb was posted on social media and attracted attention online.\n\nIn the clip the girls could be seen wearing white t-shirts and black trousers, matching down the road.\n\nOne girl held a Greek flag, while others followed by flailing the arms and swinging their legs from side-to-side.\n\nEvents commemorating Greece's wartime resistance to Axis powers Italy and Germany are a solemn affair, and public statements on the issue are closely scrutinised every year for errors.\n\nAmong those criticised this year was Education Minister Niki Kerameus, who hailed Greece's struggle 'on the eve of World War II'.\n\nThe conflict in Europe actually began in September 1939.", "description": "Ten teenage girls said they were standing up to militarism by pretending to be insubordinate soldiers and performing a Monty Python-inspired 'silly walk' at a remembrance parade in Athens.", "authors": ["Chris Dyer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/14/20378216-0-image-a-26_1572444667580.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
