But it seems if one has a big mouth, there\u2019s a good chance of getting blacklisted in the industry.\n\nSinger and humanitarian Yvonne Chaka Chaka told City Press on Friday, that it was not a secret that \u201cwhen you stand up for yourself and speak the truth as an artist, it\u2019s the end of your career\u201d.\n\nShe was speaking in the wake of actress Vatiswa Ndara\u2019s lengthy letter to Nathi Mthethwa, the minister of sports, arts and culture, in which she highlighted the exploitation and unfair working conditions of actors and artists.\n\nChaka Chaka said she hoped Ndara would still stand a chance of getting a job having spoken out publicly.\n\n\u201cOur industry should be regulated and actors should be paid what they deserve. Out of desperation actors and artists are forced to take gigs that pay far less than they deserve.\u201d\n\nChaka Chaka also disclosed she recently met a frustrated actor, who told her that she was ready to take any job because she had not been working for nine months.\n\n\u201cIt pains my heart that someone as talented as her has to struggle to get jobs. How did it get to this?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIt is our responsibility as veteran actors to speak out so that we can pave the way for young actors and musicians otherwise, if we don\u2019t do the right thing, we will be judged badly by the next generation,\u201d she said.\n\nThis week when City Press called actors to shed more light on Ndara\u2019s statement, most of them were scared, saying they had families to feed and could not afford to lose their jobs because their lives depended on production companies.\n\nBut actor Vusi Thanda, who is known for playing Tshawe in Emzini Wezinsiwa, applauded Ndara for being brave about speaking out.\n\n\u201cActors have been exploited for many years. I started acting in the 1980s and nothing has changed. Vatiswa needs to be supported by all of us [creatives]. We know she is telling the truth and we are aware that these are the challenges we creatives face on a daily basis,\u201d Thanda said.\n\nHe said the salaries they received from acting jobs meant they couldn\u2019t afford to live in a decent home, drive a decent car or have medical aid.\n\n\u201cWe use public transport. Just because we are on TV people expect us to have a luxurious life. I\u2019ve been in the industry for more than three decades but I have nothing\n\nto show to this day \u2013 that\u2019s how bad our industry is,\u201d he said.\n\nMthethwa said artists should speak out in one voice.\n\n\u201cAs we speak the president is in a difficult position right now because some [creatives] say he must sign the bill, while some say he should not,\u201d said Mthethwa, referring to the Performers\u2019 Protection Amendment Bill, which was submitted by the SA Guild of Actors to Parliament in September last year.\n\nThe bill is to protect creatives\u2019 rights.\n\nThanda agreed with Mthethwa that creatives should speak with one voice to fight the challenges in the industry. He also suggested they should establish industry standard rates.", "description": "Artists and actors already put up with a lot \u2013 from being exploited to being oppressed \u2013 because their industry is unregulated.
