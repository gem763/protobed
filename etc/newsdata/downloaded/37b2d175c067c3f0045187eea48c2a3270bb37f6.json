Since then he has set up his own pillow company, attributing his business success to his \u201csharp\u201d, \u201cstreet wise\u201d character.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to be speaking to you so soon.\n\nI know. It\u2019s such a shame. I obviously don\u2019t agree with it and I don\u2019t think a lot of people will, but it is what it is.\n\nWhy do you think Lord Sugar fired you?\n\nI have no idea. I haven\u2019t thought about it in that way. I think he usually fires people on the basis of who\u2019s responsible for the failure of the task. The reason the task failed is because we made the wrong toy for the wrong demographic and the people who were responsible for that were Tom, but also the project manager Riyonn because one, he\u2019s made a toy in the past and two, he should have made a great advert. I wasn\u2019t the person who was responsible so I don\u2019t know why Lord Sugar fired me\n\nWhat do you make of your fellow candidates calling you negative?\n\nI think that branding me negative, despite me making correct points and predictions about the toy right from the beginning, was wrong, because that\u2019s exactly why we lost. We lost because the six-to eight-year olds thought the toy was a bit too babyish,and I\u2019d said that right through. If they\u2019d listened to me, we could have made improvements. We could have found answers for those questions in the pitches. Riyonn could have chosen other people that were more suitable to pitch like myself, because I\u2019m a public speaker. I think I was an easy target for the team because I wasn\u2019t the loudest. I\u2019m not like Thomas. I don\u2019t get aggressive. I make my point and that\u2019s it \u2013 and i think because they were able to talk over me and walk all over me maybe that created the perception I was a weaker candidate.\n\nHow was your final boardroom experience?\n\nOne thing I will raise that angered me a little bit was when Lord Sugar said I was brave for coming into this process \u2013 that it was a big leap of faith. I thought that was very patronising from him, because being the first disabled candidate and proving that I was worthy of this opportunity by going through 70,000 people\u2019s worth of auditions and making it to the final 16 should have been enough of a testament to him that I\u2019m not joking around in this process. I didn\u2019t like that line at all.\n\nWould you say you were scapegoated?\n\nI absolutely think I was. They say I\u2019m negative but I say I\u2019m truthful and honest. It\u2019s characteristics of being a good businessman. It\u2019s seeing what issues there are before they arrive. If they\u2019d listened to me and made the necessary adjustments, we wouldn\u2019t have been in that boardroom. I actually put myself forward to be project manager and sub-team leader, none of which was shown or taken into consideration. I work with kids and understand how they think \u2013 I knew this toy had to be fun and engaging. I think they said I didn\u2019t contribute anything or make any suggestions, which I did. I danced in a turtle outfit and embarrassed myself on national television! [laughs]\n\nWhat was your overriding emotion when you were watching the episode?\n\nIt was relief, actually. I was very impressed that they actually kept what I said in because I stand by the points I made. I fought for my place in the boardroom, but obviously it wasn\u2019t good enough, so I was just relieved that I could come away from the process not feeling like I\u2019d humiliated myself or that I was an aggressive character someone didn\u2019t like working with. I came away with my dignity.\n\nWhich candidate is getting away with the most?\n\nI think Marianne. She\u2019s been very quiet. Lubna has also been very quiet.\n\nLottie and Thomas are big personalities of this year\u2019s series. What were they like to work with?\n\nVery difficult. How they are on camera is exactly what they\u2019re like off it. It was difficult to get a word in and I thought, rather then fighting, I\u2019d let them do them and see how far they got.\n\nWho, if anyone, do you think would make a good business partner for Lord Sugar?\n\nI think for the boys, definitely Lewis, and for the girls, Scarlett.\n\nLewis seemed to be getting quite frustrated about not being given a chance to prove himself in this episode. What did you make of that?\n\nAfter his outburst in the boardroom in the first episode, I think maybe he thought he needed to step back a bit, which I think is a very good tactic on his part. He showed professionalism on this task. He was making his point heard and just getting on with it. It\u2019s the same with Scarlett as well \u2013 they\u2019re two candidates who have a very strong chance.\n\nWhat prompted you to apply in the first place?\n\nFirstly, I\u2019m a massive fan of the show and I\u2019ve watched it every single year. Secondly, when I started my business, I looked for disabled role models and, while you have ones like Lord Sugar and Richard Branson, there was no one there I could relate to. I thought that if I couldn\u2019t find one, maybe I could start the trend of disabled entrepreneurs. Thirdly, my girlfriend saw the application process was open and signed me up without knowing.\n\nWhat advice would you have for other disabled candidates who are interested in applying for future series?\n\nMy advice would be: make sure you\u2019re an entrepreneur first. For me, I can hold my hands up and say I know I didn\u2019t get selected because of my disability; I know I got selected because of my business ability, acumen and my business plan. I can confidently say that. Make sure you\u2019re in this genuinely for business, not for your disability. Obviously it\u2019s great to be a role model and an ambassador, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about business.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for you?\n\nTwo main things: first one is I\u2019m training for the 2020 paralympic games. In a couple of months, we\u2019ll find out if I\u2019m in the team or not so I\u2019m training really hard for that. I also just want to expand my business. It\u2019s called Vision Beyond Sight and it\u2019s a company that brings in inspirational individuals to schools to promote physical and mental health to young people. It goes into corporate settings too to talk about disability in the workplace and also gets them to do team-building activities where people wear these visual impairment simulation googles and try to do everyday work and see how difficult it actually is. So yeah, just focusing on sport and business.\n\nThe Apprentice continues weekly on BBC1 at 9pm", "description": "The latest\u00a0Apprentice\u00a0candidate to be fired by Lord Sugar has been revealed \u2013 and he has a lot to say about it.
