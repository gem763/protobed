Weeks Later, a 737 Max Crashed.", "language": "en", "text": "At a ceremony in the Oval Office last October, President Trump signed the F.A.A. Reauthorization Act into law, while Representative Shuster, who shepherded the legislation, looked over his shoulder.\n\nThe agency has already begun to make the required changes.\n\nIn August, it announced the formation of the advisory committee charged with setting goals for the regulator. The committee includes two union representatives and 17 industry officials, among them Beth Pasztor, one of Boeing\u2019s top executives. The F.A.A. recently selected managers for an internal office that will help enforce provisions of the law.\n\nAs the rules take hold, some lawmakers who originally supported the legislation are backing away.\n\nMr. Nelson, the former senator who co-sponsored the law, said he did not fully understand the ramifications. \u201cThis was never brought to my attention,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHad I known about it, I would have tried to put the kibosh on it.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Peter DeFazio, the Oregon Democrat who is the chairman of the House transportation committee, celebrated the bill\u2019s changes last year, saying it would maintain safety and \u201cwill help our manufacturers become much more competitive in the world market and introduce their products more quickly.\u201d\n\nMr. DeFazio, who is currently leading a congressional investigation into the crashes, said in an interview that he was reconsidering the law and might introduce legislation to restore some of the agency\u2019s oversight authority.\n\n\u201cIf the F.A.A. basically deferred on a safety critical system and did not provide proper oversight, then either the individuals involved are going to be at risk, or the whole system itself isn\u2019t working properly,\u201d he said.", "description": "The government has been handing over more responsibility to manufacturers for years.
