Andrew Yang, a candidate for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2020, has received increasing support from disenfranchised working class voters in key \u201crust belt\u201d states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.\n\nThe radical central tenet of Mr Yang's platform is the \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d which would provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month to every American adult, much of it funded by taxing large businesses like Amazon, Google and Facebook.\n\n\u201cI'm peeling off Trump supporters,\u201d Mr Yang told The Telegraph in an interview ahead of the next Democrat debate.\n\n\u201cThere were many people who voted for Donald Trump because they believed his solutions, but his solutions were garbage and nonsense.\n\n\"They're attracted to me because I\u2019m talking about the same problems. I\u2019m running to solve problems that got Trump elected. It means, if I\u2019m the Democrat nominee, we will win, and most Democrats want a nominee who's going to win.\"\n\nAndrew Yang has pledged an annual universal basic income Credit: REUTERS/Gretchen Ertl More\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who voted for Mr Trump in 2016 have increasingly been turning up at Mr Yang\u2019s rallies, replacing their MAGA hats with ones that say \u201dMATH\" - which stands for \u201dMake America Think Harder\" - \u201dYang Gang\".\n\nAccording to polls Mr Yang, along with Bernie Sanders, is the the only Democrat who more than 10 per cent of Trump supporters say they would consider voting for.\n\nLike the president he is not averse to mixing it. Mr Yang recently called Mr Trump \u201dfat\" and a \u201dslob\" and asked: \u201dWhat could Donald Trump possibly be better than me at? An eating contest?\"\n\nHis crossover appeal is also shown by his standing in Fox News polls, which have him higher than other surveys. In a recent one he ranked fifth behind only Joe Biden, Mr Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.\n\nAs the massive Democrat field was cut in half to 10 candidates for the next debate on September 12 Mr Yang qualified with ease. More than 200,000 people have donated to his campaign.\n\nThe former technology entrepreneur also has the endorsement of Elon Musk. Mr Yang paints an apocalyptic picture of the future - something along the lines of Terminator or The Hunger Games - unless action is taken to alleviate the inevitable rise of robots.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe're going to lose to automation and AI (artificial intelligence) 20 to 40 per cent of American jobs in 10 to 20 years. This is essentially a consensus.\n\nDemocratic 2020 US presidential candidates pose together before a debate Credit: REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo More", "description": "For supporters of Donald Trump now\u00a0disillusioned with his actions an improbable figure is emerging on the Left.
