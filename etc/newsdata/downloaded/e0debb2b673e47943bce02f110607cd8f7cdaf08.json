He\u2019s got nine months of work ahead of him and dude would rather watch reruns of Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nCrash-landing from lazy holidays and extra screen time into a far more challenging term isn\u2019t easy, and the transition is one that affects the whole family. Which is why if ever there were a time for hacks, this is it. So we\u2019re going to give you everything we\u2019ve got to help ease you into the new school year.\n\nMornings\n\nThat first morning is always particularly hectic. Alarm clocks will fail to go off, children will be cranky, you\u2019ll spill coffee all down the front of your nice work attire, and you\u2019ll think, \u201cCheers to another year of this!\u201d\n\nMornings have always sucked, and we have every reason to believe they always will suck, but who would we be if we didn\u2019t try to find a way to make mornings flow a little easier? (Actually, we\u2019re overachievers, so we found five ways.)\n\nAfter school\n\nIf your parenting experience is anything like my parenting experience, kids are just sort of done at the end of the school day. This is true all year long, but it\u2019s especially true at the beginning of the school year, when they\u2019re getting back in the groove of being \u201con\u201d all day long.\n\nPart of getting through the after-school meltdowns is simply accepting them as a part of reality; the other part is to do a few things to support them (and yourself) through the transition.\n\nCo-parenting\n\nThe back-to-school transition is trying in the best of circumstances, but if you\u2019re co-parenting with an ex, things can be even more stressful. There are some proactive steps you can take, though, to lay out expectations for everyone involved and establish a sense of predictability for your kids.\n\nBackpacks\n\nRemember the 90s, when wearing just one strap of your backpack was cool and wearing both straps meant you were hopelessly nerdy? Thankfully, kids don\u2019t seem to care about that particular brand of dumbassery these days. (Also, why did we think a winter jacket was only socially acceptable if it was unzipped??)\n\nBut even with two straps, those things can become surprisingly heavy and uncomfortable for a kid to carry around. But you can protect your kid\u2019s back from a too-heavy or ill-fitting backpack.\n\nHomework\n\nHomework is the necessary(?) evil from which our kids \u2014 and therefore we \u2014 cannot escape. Well, I declare this is the year that homework is not going to be such a stressful endeavour in our homes because this year we\u2019re going to help them manage their homework anxiety, we\u2019re going to try some of these concentration hacks and we\u2019re going to be more flexible and creative about where they actually complete their homework.\n\n(Fingers crossed, everyone.)\n\nConnection\n\nIf you want to do a cute thing for your little kid that will make them think of you every day (but don\u2019t want to commit to writing a daily note or drawing a picture five days a week on their foil-covered ham sandwich), we\u2019ve got an idea for you. Write sweet notes on their pencils.\n\nWant to remember how cute their little kindergarten voice sounded when they\u2019re all grown up and heading off to their freshmen year of college? Do like this dad and interview your kids every year after their first day of school. Go ahead, watch the video and try not to cry.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll want to talk to them about how their day was for all the other days that come after the first one, but pulling any details out of them gets harder and harder each year. Their day was fine, they learned nothing.\n\nThat\u2019s ok; we\u2019re older and wiser and we\u2019ve got ways of making them talk.\n\nMental health\n\nStarting over in a new classroom with a new teacher (and sometimes different classmates) is hard. It would be like taking on a new position at work with a new schedule once a year \u2014 except we\u2019re adults so, in theory, we have a few more coping strategies for managing stress. Once in a while, we all need a mental health day \u2014 and our kids do, too.\n\nOK, you\u2019ve now done all you can do. May your kids go forth and have a great school year.", "description": "My son starts third grade next week, and this is the first year where instead of being all, \u201cYay for friends and learning!\u201d he\u2019s more like, \u201cyeah, school, great.\u201d I can understand how he feels.
