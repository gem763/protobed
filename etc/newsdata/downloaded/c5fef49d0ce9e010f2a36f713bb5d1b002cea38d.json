MPC, +5.34% shot up 6.2% toward a 4 1/2-month high in premarket trading Wednesday, after activist investor Elliott Management said it sees potential for the oil refiner's stock to rise 61% from current levels. In a letter to Marathon Chairman Gary Heminger, Elliott, which manages funds that own about 2.5% of the economic interest in Marathon, said it believes the company could unlock more than $22 billion in shareholder value with no change in operating assumptions, and an additional $17 billion in value through achieving full operating potential. Elliott urged the company to separate into three independent businesses, RetailCo as a convenience-store operator, MidstreamCo as a midstream operator and RefiningCo as an independent merchant refiner. A 61% gain from Tuesday's stock closing price of $55.48 would lift the price to $89.32, which would be above the Oct. 3, 2018 record close of $86.39. The stock has tumbled 34.8% over the past 12 months through Tuesday, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF XLE, -1.60% has lost 21.3% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.15% has gained 1.8%.", "description": "Shares of Marathon Petroleum Corp. shot up 6.2% toward a 4 1/2-month high in premarket trading Wednesday, after activist investor Elliott Management said it...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
