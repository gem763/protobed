Both publications were horrified at Trump\u2019s gall, with The New Yorker lamenting his lack of \u201crestraints\u201d and the Times bemoaning his \u201cassault on democratic norms.\u201d\n\nNaughty boy, tsk, tsk.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMy point is not to suggest that the erudite newspaper and the even more erudite magazine are word-challenged. Far from it.\n\nRather, they are thought-challenged. When it comes to Trump, neither has had a new thought in four years.\n\nTheir \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d is that a brash billionaire comes down an escalator with his third wife in a glitzy Manhattan high-rise with his name on it and has the nerve to say he\u2019s going to be president.

Blinded by hatred, they don\u2019t try to hide their contempt for him and his supporters.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nNone of this would matter if two elite publications were shouting in the wilderness. In fact, the Times and The New Yorker very much reflect \u2014 and help shape \u2014 the mindset of the Democratic Party.\n\nAs such, they illustrate how far anti-Trumpers have strayed into the impeachment wilderness.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING MICHAEL GOODWIN'S COLUMN IN THE NEW YORK POST\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MICHAEL GOODWIN", "description": "The media has failed to come up with a new thought in four years.", "authors": ["Michael Goodwin"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/06/694940094001_6092681670001_6092690903001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
