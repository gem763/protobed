A pair of right hamstring injuries followed each of the next two years before the Markham, Ont., sprinter rebounded strongly this season.\n\nIf it wasn't for family I don't know where I'd be. They kept me positive. \u2014 World bronze medallist Andre De Grasse on his recovery from injuries in 2017 and 2018\n\nThe injuries played a part in splitting from Canadian coach Stu McMillan of the ALTIS training group last fall and moving to Jacksonville, Fla., to work with American sprint guru Rana Reider, who has helped De Grasse regain confidence.\n\n\"Trust the coach and be patient,\" said De Grasse. \"As the season progressed, I just kept on getting better and better.\"\n\nIn Saturday's final, he passed Akani Simbine of South Africa in the final metres while teammate and 2019 Canadian champion Aaron Brown placed eighth in 10.08. Also in the stands in support of De Grasse was his mother Beverley and girlfriend Nia Ali.\n\n6 podium finishes in 2019\n\n\"If it wasn't for family I don't know where I'd be,\" he said. \"They kept me positive [in my injury recovery] and said to keep that dedication and commitment and [I would] turn things around \u2026 and today was a good sign.\"\n\nDe Grasse strained his right hamstring during a training run just days before the start of 2017 worlds in London. And his 2018 campaign ended in July when he re-injured the hamstring at the Canadian championships.\n\nDe Grasse returned to the track for his first 100 race of 2019 on May 21 and ran 10.09 for second place at the Nanjing World Challenge in China. Saturday's result gives him six podium finishes in eight races in the event this season.\n\nIt marked the first time since the 2015 NCAA semifinals that De Grasse and Coleman ran head-to-head in the 100. De Grasse passed Coleman in the final 10 metres of the 200 on a wet track to clock a 19.91 SB two months ago at the Golden Spike meet in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Coleman was second in 19.97.\n\nJoining De Grasse in the 200 heats on Sunday at 1:05 p.m. ET will be Brendon Rodney of Brampton, Ont., and Brown. All three will be part of Canada's relay team later at the 10-day competition.\n\nDe Grasse, who believes his 19.87 PB from the 2016 Olympics also could fall in Doha, told Russell there is a possibility of returning to the podium in the 100, 200 and relay next summer at the Summer Games in Tokyo.\n\n\"I believe so. My confidence level is great,\" he said.\n\nColeman's previous PB was 9.79, his winning time at the 2018 Diamond League Final in Brussels. He awoke Saturday with a season world-leading time of 9.81 and went 9.88 in the semifinals earlier in the day.\n\nA rested Coleman arrived in Doha having not run the 100 since winning in 9.99 in late July at the U.S. championships. A month later, he was charged with a potential anti-doping rule violation for failing to properly file his whereabouts information, but the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency eventually dropped his care for missed doping tests on a technicality.\n\nBrown, the two-time reigning Canadian champion in the 100, said his transition struggles in Saturday's semifinal continued in the final and will be something to work on for next season.\n\nThe Toronto native also revealed he was \"close\" to focusing solely on the 200 in Doha and \"can't complain too much\" about reaching the 100 final.\n\nCBC Sports has exclusive live coverage of the 2019 World Track & Field Championships from Sept. 27-Oct. 6.
