I\u2019m not big into dresses and skirts, but I love a good suit. This was taken at the Asian awards a few years ago \u2013 I love saris and all the extraordinary silks in traditional clothes, but I think that, for my heritage, a suit and a panama hat suits me just fine. When it comes to clothes, I think it\u2019s important to feel like yourself, more than anything. I have become a little bit attached to hats, but I don\u2019t have that many. I had always been a big fan of Clint Eastwood, the suffragettes and Bob Dylan, and they all seem to have hats on in their best photos, so I just started wearing them, too. I find it cuts corners in terms of not having to worry too much about your hair. You don\u2019t even have to worry too much about your outfit if you have a good hat on.\n\nI\u2019m also wearing my driving gloves; they are ace. I\u2019ve worn them so often I need to replace them. There are so many iconic films where actors wear driving gloves \u2013 I put them on just to drive round the corner to the shops and it makes it feel a bit more adventurous and exciting. The pearls were just next to the door, so I put them on, too.\n\nIn the 90s, I used to wear clothes just for the ironic fun of it. It was often the most bizarre concoctions I could find. I had a gold cowboy hat and massive flares, with \u201cTommy\u201d written down one leg and \u201cHilfiger\u201d down the other, in three different colours, red white and blue. I\u2019d wear it with a tiny silk top. My favourite quote is from Vivienne Westwood: \u201cWhen in doubt, overdress.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the fashion was for understated looks, just one or two colours or cargo trousers, but I just liked to throw it all on: kaftans, turbans, just to have fun with the clothes, rather than wear anything sleek or serious. As a result, I do look back at loads of photos and go: \u201cOh my God, what in the heavens was I thinking?\u201d\n\nCerys Matthews is the co-founder of the Good Life Experience, 12-15 September 2019.
