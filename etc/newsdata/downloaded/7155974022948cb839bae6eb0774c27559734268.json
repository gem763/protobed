He told news.com.au he thought the hive, which was elaborate and metres long, had been in the home for about two years.\n\nThe homeowners, a couple from Carseldine in Brisbane, said they\u2019d been able to hear the bees buzzing from inside their home. But they were shocked to discover a massive, two-metre-long, 30cm-deep hive had been built into the ceiling of their home, with an estimated 70,000 bees taking up residence between the joists in the ceiling\u2019s cavity.\n\nBefore the hive was discovered, the couple had seen the bees outside and had suffered a few stings.\n\n\u201cAnd you can just hear them \u2026 a humming and a little bit of a scratching noise,\u201d one of the homeowners told the ABC.\n\nMr Wood said during spring, the discovery of new hives was not unusual as bees were likely to swarm and move about in groups.\n\nHe said bee colonies naturally \u201csplit\u201d into a swarm, with colonies travelling in swarms to create new hives. As he talked to news.com.au, he was travelling to remove a swarm from a Brisbane Hospital.\n\n\u201cSwarming is natural \u2013 the groups of bees split in half,\u201d he told news.com.au. \u201cThey would naturally look for a tree to swarm in before building a hive.\u201d\n\nHe explained hives and swarms of bees occurred in unusual places due to habitat loss and trees being cut down.\n\nMr Wood said calling pest control to exterminate the insects could often be a mistake \u2013 in this case, the roof would have to be removed nonetheless. He said any amount of honey left in the ceiling would \u201cdestroy\u201d the roof.\n\nTo remove the hive, Mr Wood cut into the roof and vacuumed up the bees, which were transported from the home in a special box. Mr Wood said he\u2019d be taking the bees to his own property to care for them.", "description": "A Brisbane couple made a shocking discovery in their roof after noticing a distinct \u201chumming\u201d noise inside their home.", "authors": ["Phoebe Loomes"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a0a2ccb0faf04da3fa05bebe7e611484?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
