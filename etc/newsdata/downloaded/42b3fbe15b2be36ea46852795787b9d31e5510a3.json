But things are changing.\n\nREAD | Volkswagen reveals a new logo for the brand at Frankfurt IAA\n\nVW is overhauling its image with a new brand identity. The VW roundel is an instantly recognisable trademark and contains the deep brand value \u2013 which makes it odd that anybody would wish to alter it.\n\nFiddling with brand identity symbols, especially when they are established and regarded, is fraught with risk. Why would VW bother with changing its corporate identity?\n\nWhat do you think of the new VW logo? Email us and tell us what you think.\n\nThe simplification of its VW logo has ostensibly been done to make the company\u2019s badge more digitally identifiable.\n\nThree-dimensional shapes are not the best for digital media and since the 2000 redesign, VW\u2019s logo has contained a deep 3D etching element.\n\nBy flattening and thinning the linework of VW\u2019s logo, it is now easier to recognise, with greater visual impact, when viewed on any digital screen.\n\nConsidering the importance of digital media and marketing, VW\u2019s decision to reconfigure its logo for better digital legibility is understandable. But that is not the only reason it has been done.\n\nSimper logos for battery cars\n\nVW is amidst the greatest transformation in its history. The company\u2019s significant engineering resources have been refocused on electrification, as VW attempts to deliver a product portfolio that is 40% battery-powered by 2030.\n\nThis revolution in powertrain diversity means that VW\u2019s cars will soon start looking a lot different, especially from the front.\n\nThe automotive grille is a crucial styling feature of any modern vehicle. We recognise brands more via their grille design than any other singular styling detail.\n\nIf you crop out the headlights, bumper and bonnet of any vehicle, identification would still be possible \u2013 simply by virtue of grille design differentiation.\n\nImage: Janine Van der Post\n\nElectric cars don\u2019t require a traditional grille, and this changes the way that stylists and designers will choose to shape and surface the front of their cars in future. A very near future \u2013 for VW.\n\nWith the likelihood that a brand badge will no longer be sitting on a conventional grille background, the challenge to redesign badges has begun.\n\nA grille background is dark, with strong horizontal lines or intricate honeycomb patterns.\n\nTo make its VW roundel contrast properly on that backing, VW optioned to evolve it with a three-dimensional shape for decades. But on an electric car, that isn\u2019t going to work.\n\nBattery-powered vehicles will have a solid nose surface, instead of a grille. And on a solid surface and colour backing, the simpler linework of VW\u2019s new badge is a necessary change.\n\nVW has been the first automotive company to reform its logo, with a mindfulness to how its future electric vehicles will look in a realm of design without functional grilles. It will certainly no be the last.", "description": "'Small screen digital recognition is one thing, but there is another reason for VW\u2019s new logo too.'
