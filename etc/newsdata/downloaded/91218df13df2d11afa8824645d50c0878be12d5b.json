Romney said when explaining in the interview that he has a secret Twitter account in order to keep an eye on political conversations.\n\n'I won't give you the name of it,' Romney said, but told the reporter he's following 668 people, and went on to list some of the accounts he follows, which includes journalists, late night comedians and athletes.\n\nThe account does not follow Donald Trump.\n\n'He tweets so much,' Romney said. He compared the president to one of his nieces who overshares on Instagram: 'I love her, but it's like, Ah, it's too much.'\n\nRomney confirmed later Sunday night that he is behind the account. 'C'est moi,' Romney told The Atlantic, which in French means, 'It's me.' A funny tid bit considering the account name is French.\n\nUtah Senator Mitt Romney has a 'lurker' Twitter account, which he admitted to in an interview with The Atlantic, which was published Sunday\n\nAlthough Romney did not reveal the name of the account, Slate discovered and published that it is Pierre Delecto or @qaws9876. The account, which mostly follows journalists, politicians, political pundits and comedians was changed to private after the handle was discovered and published Sunday evening\n\nSince Slate's article revealing Delecto's real identity hit, the account, which only has 10 tweets, went private.\n\nThe account was found through Romney's oldest grandchild Allie Romney Critchlow, who only has 481 followers, Romney's shadow account was discovered among them.\n\nAt the time Slate published the reveal, the account was following 702 people and had only 8 followers. It now has 1,172 followers and can only be accessed if a user requests to follow the account.\n\nAll tweets on the account appear to be responses to other tweets, including to a writer for Resurgent, a conservative christian outlet, Erick Erikson, Fox News political analyst Brit Hume and political consultant John Weaver.\n\nWhile the majority of accounts Romney, as Delecto, follows are political reporters, politicians, political operatives or pundits, he notably also follows late night comedians Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon. He also followers Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady and former NFL quarterback Brett Farve.\n\nRomney often touts himself from the Delecto account. In one instance Bloomberg reporter Steven Dennis tweeted a short list of GOP senators 'sticking up for' fellow Senator Richard Burr. Romney was not on the list.\n\n'Romney too,' the Delecto account tweeted as a response to Dennis. 'Said to Post he has confidence in Chairman Burr.'\n\nHe also condemned Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria in response to a tweet from Weaver.\n\n'John, agree on Trump's awful decision, but what could the Senate do to stop it?' the Delecto account questioned after Weaver tweeted the president 'betrayed our allies in Syria' and blamed it on the 'GOP Senate.'\n\nThe Delecto account joined Twitter in July of 2011, which was one month after Romney announced Republican bid for president. The bio portion of the profile is blank.\n\nA White House aide told DailyMail.com that Romney's new moniker in the West Wing is 'In flagrante Delecto.'\n\nThe legal term 'In flagrante delicto' is used to indicate that a criminal was caught in the middle of committing an offense. An English equivalent to the Latin phrase is 'caught red-handed.'\n\nThe account has become more active lately, but of the more than 250 tweets liked be Delecto over the last eight years, 30 have come from his official congressional account @SenatorRomney, 28 from his personal @MittRomney account, seven were tweets quoting of of the accounts and three directly mentioned one of his accounts. There were several others tweets liked by Delecto that reference Romney without either Twitter handle.\n\nEven though Trump and Romney often butt heads, the president endorsed the Utah lawmaker for his Senate bid in the 2018 midterm elections.", "description": "Mitt Romney has a secret Twitter account that he used to promote his failed 2012 campaign and now uses to engage with reporters and condemn political moves with which he disagrees.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19992628-0-image-a-42_1571668306096.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
