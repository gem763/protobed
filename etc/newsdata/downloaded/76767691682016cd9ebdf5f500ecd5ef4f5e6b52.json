(Win McNamee/Getty Images) Photographer: Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n\nPresident Rutherford B. Hayes stepped away from the clambake, raised the strange device to his ear and, after an astonished pause, began to grin.\n\nHe was cradling one of the world\u2019s first phones, craning to hear the man on the other end of the line: Alexander Graham Bell, the Scottish-born inventor of the telephone, who had carefully prepared his message for the 19th president. It was June 1877 in Warwick, Rhode Island, where Hayes had traveled to eat clams and speak before a gathering of Civil War veterans.\n\nIt was the first time a U.S. president had ever answered the phone.\n\nBell, phoning from a hotel 13 miles away, spoke with great gravity: \u201cMr. President, I am duly sensible of the great honor conferred upon me in this for the first time presenting the speaking telephone to the attention of the President of the United States,\u201d he said, as reported by local paper the Providence Journal. \u201cI shall be very glad to hear something in reply, if you please.\u201d\n\nBy this point, Hayes\u2019s face was \u201cwreathed\u201d in smiles, and \u201cwonder shone in his eyes,\u201d according to the Journal. During Bell\u2019s speech, he had lowered the phone (which \u201cresembled a rather large-sized bobbin,\u201d the paper reported) to declare the new technology simply \u201cwonderful.\u201d Now \u2014 as Bell waited anxiously and bystanders watched in awe \u2014 Hayes delivered the first six words ever spoken by an American president on a phone call.\n\n\u201cPlease,\" he said. \u201cSpeak a little more slowly.\u201d\n\n[Trump's call with Ukrainian leader is unlike anything presidential scholars have heard before]\n\nHayes\u2019s gentle, record-setting call seems galaxies away from the America of late 2019, when presidential phone conversations are once again in the news. President Trump is facing immense political fire \u2014 and the threat of impeachment \u2014 after revelations that he asked Ukraine to investigate one of his potential 2020 opponents during a recent phone call with that country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThis is almost always how things go nowadays, said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a University of Washington professor who studies presidential history.\n\n\u201cPhones long ago became part of the aura of the modern presidency,\u201d O\u2019Mara said. \u201cWhen phone use becomes important, it\u2019s because it\u2019s associated with scandal \u2014 we\u2019re not really paying attention to how the president uses the phone until there\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\nIn the roughly century-and-a-half since Hayes installed a phone in the White House, presidents have wielded the telephone to conduct important state business, at times charting the course of world affairs. Franklin D. Roosevelt called Winston Churchill during World War II; John F. Kennedy\u2019s establishment of a direct \u201chotline\u201d to the Kremlin marked a watershed moment in the Cold War, experts said; and, in 2013, Barack Obama ended a decades-long diplomatic freeze with Iran by ringing up President Hassan Rouhani in his car.\n\nBut there were other uses, too. Americans born in the last 50 years are probably more likely to associate presidential calls with rampant profanity (Lyndon B. Johnson), racist slurs (Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan) and phone sex (Bill Clinton).\n\n[How 'transcripts' of presidential calls are created]\n\nAs Trump continues to insist he did nothing wrong in the roughly 30-minute call, remembering how and why presidents have used the phone over the years suggests an echo with \u2014 and informs \u2014 the present moment, O\u2019Mara said.\n\n\u201cFor all of us, talking on the phone, we become less guarded,\u201d she said. \u201cThis goes for presidents, too, which makes for particularly interesting moments: places where slip ups happen.\"\n\nO\u2019Mara paused. \"Where, sometimes, the truth is revealed.\u201d\n\n\u2018The new talking device\u2019\n\n\n\nEngraving From 1881 Featuring The American President, Rutherford B. Hayes. Hayes Lived From 1822 Until 1893. (iStock)\n\nHayes didn\u2019t wait long after the Rhode Island call to bring the \u201cwonderful\u201d new technology to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nOn October 26, 1877, he and his wife hosted a small party to celebrate the installment of a phone line connecting the White House and the Treasury Department, Ari Hoogenboom reported in his book \u201cRutherford B. Hayes: Warrior and President.\u201d Because First Lady Lucy Hayes loved music, guests launched into song \u2014 until one man\u2019s \u201cpowerful bass voice\u201d struck a high C, shattering the phone\u2019s sounding board and putting an \u201cabrupt\u201d end to the mini-concert, according to Hoogenboom.\n\nHayes chose to place the telephone \u2014 at first, reachable by dialing \"1\u2033 \u2014 in the White House\u2019s small telegraph office, where it would remain for decades. Almost no one owned phones back then (Hayes could call just 188 people, according to the Chicago Sunday Tribune) so he probably made little use of it, historians said.\n\nStill, he deserves credit, said Julie Mayle, the curator of manuscripts at the Hayes Presidential Library Museum.\n\n[A history of extreme makeovers at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue]\n\n\u201cWe always like to feel that President Hayes embraced technology,\u201d Mayle said. \u201cHe welcomed the telephone, he had the first typewriter in the White House \u2014 we do have documentation that he was very willing to accept these changes.\u201d\n\nThe next major milestone in presidential phone history came decades later during the reign of another tech-savvy president, Herbert Hoover. Though little-remembered for the trait today, Hoover was \u201ca total adopter of technology... a techie,\u201d presidential historian O\u2019Mara said.\n\nOn March 29, 1929, Hoover took a monumental step: he removed the presidential telephone from a foyer outside the Oval Office and gave it pride of place on his desk, according to History.com.\n\nIn some ways, the decision was overdue: phones had widely penetrated American society by the early 20th century, becoming an \"ubiquitous appliance,\u201d O\u2019Mara said. Hoover\u2019s action signaled to voters that he was \u201ca very modern president\u201d fit for the times, she said.\n\n[How Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone]\n\nIt also had broader implications \u2014 for the presidency and the country, said Stephen Engle, a professor of history at Florida Atlantic University. Hoover would go on to use the phones \u201cas a center of governmental administrative command\u201d throughout his time in office, according to Engle.\n\nThe 31st president\u2019s prominent placement and \u201cuse of the new talking device, previously considered to be beneath the office of the presidency, helped reshape the communication and administration styles of all presidents going forward,\u201d Engle said.\n\nThe small phone on the big desk, Engle added, \u201csymbolized a new era in things presidential.\"\n\n\u2018A central political tool\u2019\n\n\n\nIn this May 25, 1961, file photo, President John F.

Kennedy, who assumed office in 1961 as America\u2019s 35th president. Kennedy was not a mindless devotee of the device: he preferred chatting with his \u201cinner circle of advisors\u201d in person, said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University.\n\nBut he certainly used it \u2014 sometimes, for world-shifting events like the installation of a direct line to Soviet Premier Nikita Kruschchev. That came during the heat of the Cold War, not too long after the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis that almost led to nuclear conflict between America and Russia.\n\nIn announcing the hotline (which still exists today as a secure computer link, according to Politico), the White House vowed it would \u201chelp reduce the risk of war occurring by accident or miscalculation.\u201d\n\n[Jackie Kennedy's fairy-tale wedding was a nightmare for her African American dress designer]\n\nAround the same time, Kennedy used the phone to address a very different kind of \u201cmiscalculation.\u201d He and his family were vacationing in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts in the summer of 1963 when an unflattering Washington Post article appeared.\n\nThe Post\u2019s story \u2014 written by Marie Smith \u2014 revealed government efforts to prepare a special maternity suite in a local hospital for Jacqueline Kennedy, who was pregnant. The Air Force spent $5,000 to ship special furniture from Boston, The Post reported, and splurged on items including bullet-proof windows and wall-to-wall carpeting.\n\nTo top it off, The Post also published a photo of an Air Force officer standing, grinning, by the hospital bed.\n\nIn a recorded call with an Air Force general, Kennedy exploded: \u201cDid you see The Post this morning? ... What the hell did they let the reporters in there for? ... You just sank the Air Force budget!\u201d\n\nAs for \u201cthat silly bastard with his picture next to the bed,\u201d Kennedy continued, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want him running a cathouse!\u201d\n\nRecording of presidential phone calls didn\u2019t start with Kennedy \u2014 more likely, it began under FDR, according to O\u2019Mara. It was Kennedy\u2019s successor Lyndon B. Johnson who made an art of it, however, taping roughly 9,500 calls over the course of his presidency.\n\n[Lyndon Johnson left office as a deeply unpopular president. Why is he admired today?]\n\nJohnson loved the phone, Zelizer said. He used it constantly \u2014 whether calling members of Congress to seek cooperation on bills, chatting with civil rights leaders in a bid to earn their support, or contacting leaders of other countries to forge American foreign policy.\n\nHe made most of his phone calls in the Oval Office, according to Zelizer. Johnson, a (highly profane) master of persuasion, often started conversations with \u201cslow, methodical talking\" \u2014 like he was \u201cfeeling out\u201d the person on the line \u2014 and grew increasingly \u201cfrenetic\u201d as he got worked up about a topic, according to Zelizer.\n\n\u201cFor him, the phone was a central political tool: he liked to call people at all hours of the night and day and try to lobby them through the phone,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cThis was incessant.\u201d\n\nOne anecdote is particularly telling, Zelizer said: the time when, early in Johnson\u2019s tenure, the president tried to phone a top advisor, Joseph A. Califano Jr. An assistant answered, apologized and explained that Califano couldn\u2019t talk \u2014 he was using the bathroom.\n\nJohnson flew into a rage.\n\n\u201cSo he orders Califano to put a phone in his bathroom, so he could reach him at all times,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cAnd I think that just says it all.\u201d\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t know what they do\u2019\n\n\n\nPresident Richard M. Nixon points to the transcripts of the White House tapes in April 1974 after he announced during a nationally-televised speech that he would turn over the transcripts to House impeachment investigators, in Washington. (AP Photo/File)\n\nThings go dark after Richard Nixon.\n\nNixon, as America would learn in scarring detail, was an avid user of the telephone, relying on it for both personal and professional discussions \u2014 and he taped everything. His decision to record all conversations (over 3,700 hours of tape) arguably led to his political downfall during the Watergate scandal.\n\nThe revelations of Watergate \u2014 especially Nixon\u2019s phone calls \u2014 forever altered the way presidents used the phone, Zelizer said. For one thing, Nixon\u2019s successors never recorded their calls.\n\nThey also released limited information about who they spoke with and what they spoke about, according to Zelizer.\n\n\u201cAfter that, presidents become much more circumspect about what they say and what they record, so we don\u2019t know what they do,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cBut from what we know they\u2019re not as candid: Johnson was very candid on the phone in terms of what he thought about things, and it\u2019s hard to imagine a president feeling that freedom after Nixon.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to know what Trump\u2019s place in presidential phone history will be. The 45th president has advanced at least one claim to fame, however.\n\nThe conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president, Trump wrote in a Sept. 25 tweet, has no parallel \u2014 \u201ca perfect call.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWhen phone use becomes important, it\u2019s because it\u2019s associated with scandal \u2014 we\u2019re not really paying attention to how the president uses the phone until there\u2019s a big problem,\" presidential historian Margaret O'Mara said.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
