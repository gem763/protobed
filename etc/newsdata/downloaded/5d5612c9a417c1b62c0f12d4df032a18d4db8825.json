How can this be defended?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we are, with a leadership apparently determined to shut down democratic debate on the crucial issue of the day, probably relying on union bloc votes to outvote the members.\u201d\n\nAnd Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a pro-EU backbencher, said: \u201cThis conference is our one chance before an election to get out of the fudge \u2013 we cannot allow that to be taken away from us in some procedural stitch up.\u201d\n\nThe fresh controversy blew up within minutes of the bitter row over the attempt to topple Tom Watson being settled with a victory for the deputy leader and Corbyn critic.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We would have to consider it seriously,\u201d Ms Thornberry said.\n\nShe also criticised Mr Corbyn\u2019s intention to \u2018stay neutral\u2019 in a fresh referendum, saying: \u201cI think it wouldn't be right for Labour to have no opinion on such a big decision.\u201d\n\nThe leadership\u2019s blueprint would see a one-day special conference decide \u2013 eventually \u2013 Labour\u2019s campaigning position, putting it in the hands of the unions and grassroots.\n\nIf it wins an election, the party would seek a deal including a customs union, a \u201cclose relationship with the single market\u201d, guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections, and membership of joint bodies on climate change, counter-terrorism and medicines.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of a Labour conference \u201cstitch-up\u201d to avoid a defeat that would force him to be\u00a0pro-Remain\u00a0in a fresh\u00a0Brexit\u00a0referendum.
