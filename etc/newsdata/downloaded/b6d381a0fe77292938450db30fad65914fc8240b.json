There was a time when I'd feel quite embarrassed about it, and would put off going out in public, but now, I just get on with it.\n\n\"For my two daughters, I've hiccuped their entire lives so it doesn't bother them.\n\n\"It can wake me up in the night, and sometimes my husband too, but it's only a minor inconvenience.\n\n\"Knowing what happened to me during my pregnancy for no reason, I'm lucky. It could have been a lot worse.\"", "description": "Lisa Graves, from Lincoln, can hiccup over 100 times a day - and the sound has been likened to a dog being stamped on", "authors": ["William Lailey", "Jess Grievson-Smith", "Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Caters News Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20670869.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-HICCUPS-FOR-12-YEARS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
