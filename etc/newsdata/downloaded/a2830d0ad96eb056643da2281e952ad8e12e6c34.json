The personal income tax indirectly touches wealth, but only when assets are sold and become income.\u201d\n\nThe Economic Innovation Group, a nonprofit that seeks to encourage investment in low-income areas, reports by the end of 2017, American households had $3.8 trillion in unrealized gains in stocks and investment funds and even more in real estate, private businesses and artwork, says the Journal.\n\nIf raiding retirement funds occurs, it will start at the extremes, as most outrages do. The strategy will be to again beat up on the successful and wealthy as part of the left\u2019s envy, greed and entitlement scenario.\n\nWe regularly hear from Democrats how rich people aren\u2019t paying their \u201cfair share,\u201d though they never tell us what they consider fair and how much of that share they think government should seize.\n\nAfter socking it to the rich, Democrats won\u2019t stop there. Having established a precedent and again raising taxes on capital gains, they will ultimately find a way to come after your IRA and 401K accounts, which harbor money you have earned for your retirement and pay taxes on as the funds are withdrawn. Not soon enough for Democrats. They think you should be taxed on it now, though how that would happen is yet to be determined as we currently receive a tax deduction for money we invest until age 70-1/2, when mandatory withdrawals must start.\n\nAs usual, this debate begins at the wrong end. Since college has just started for many students, try this analogy. Your child is sent off to school and has agreed to a budget. After the first month, you get a call asking for more money because the kid has spent it all on partying. You can either send more money, which will only encourage the irresponsible behavior, or you can say \u201cno.\u201d\n\nPoliticians seem incapable of saying \u201cno,\u201d chiefly because it isn\u2019t their money they are spending and because they use it to buy votes, addicting more people to government and thus, to them.\n\nIt\u2019s an old, but relevant quote: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven\u2019t taxed enough; we have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.\u201d Add $21 trillion to Ronald Reagan\u2019s remark, to reflect the current debt.\n\nIrresponsible spending by both parties is sufficient reason not to give politicians more of our money. Who will stop them from coming after our retirement funds? Since a majority in both parties seems unwilling to restrain themselves, we the people must do it for them. Call it an intervention and it has never been more needed.\n\nIt can start with next year\u2019s election.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
