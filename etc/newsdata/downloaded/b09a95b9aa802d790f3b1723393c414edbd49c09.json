In fact, the latest news is two more manufacturers are bailing out of the Quebec rendezvous.\n\nThe organizers, the Corporation des concessionnaires d\u2019automobiles de Montr\u00e9al, learned a few days ago Audi and Volvo won\u2019t show their new vehicles at the downtown Palais des Congr\u00e8s during the show\u2019s January 17 to 26 run for 2020.\n\nThat implies Polestar, Volvo\u2019s new electric-performance brand, which just announced Montreal would play home to its first North American dealership, won\u2019t catch any of the eyes of the metropole\u2019s Auto Show 200,000 visitors.\n\nThese two absentees join an already-not-coming Mercedes-Benz; corporate in Germany announced last September the best-selling luxury brand in Canada and the U.S. would be a no-show at all North American exhibitions this year.\n\nBut, in Montreal, though Mercedes-Benz won\u2019t be represented as a manufacturer, local dealerships have accepted the show\u2019s offer of a small area outside the main floor, where they\u2019ll display their latest products, says SIAM vice-president Denis Dessureault.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Montreal\u2019s automotive rendezvous has to deal with AWOL manufacturers. Most notably, at the turn of this century, a bunch of luxury brands decided to skip the Montreal Auto Show, then held at the Olympic Stadium, over its crashed roof, and organized their own annual event at Place Bonaventure. It lasted only two years.\n\nMore recently, we saw Porsche drop out of the SIAM picture from 2012 to 2014; it came back in 2015, though Volvo didn\u2019t participate that year, nor in 2016.\n\nVolvo also bails from Toronto\u2019s CIAS\n\nWhat about the Canadian International Auto Show (CIAS), scheduled for its 47th run at the Metro Toronto Convention Center from February 14 to 24 next year? Well, there\u2019s good news and bad news.\n\nYes, Audi will show its new products in la Ville-Reine, confirms spokesperson Cort Nielsen, adding the Montreal \u201cno-show\u201d decision \u201cwas taken by the Montreal dealers.\u201d\n\nThe bad news? Volvo won\u2019t participate in Toronto\u2019s CIAS, despite the auto show being the biggest in Canada \u2013 with 350,000 visitors \u2013 and despite Ontario\u2019s market registering 42 per cent of all new cars sold each year in the country.\n\nFor now, only Volvo and Mercedes-Benz are out of the CIAS, though. \u201cThat brings us to a total of 38 brands for this 2020 edition,\u201d general manager Jason Campbell told Driving.ca. He quietly added that the floor space vacated by Benz was quickly grabbed up by competitor BMW-Mini.\n\nNo confirmations for the 100th annual Vancouver Auto Show\n\nWhen it comes to the Vancouver International Auto Show, an event celebrating its 100th anniversary in March, nothing is confirmed, or not confirmed \u2014 \u201cWe don\u2019t secure our dealers that quickly,\u201d executive director Jason Heard told us.\n\nThat said, Vancouver\u2019s automotive rendezvous already dealt with an absent Mercedes-Benz last year, as did Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, New York, Chicago\u2014\n\nAnd it could be so much worst. The 2019 NAIAS, the last North American International Auto Show held in Detroit in its usual January slot, had to deal with a much longer list of absentees. Audi, BMW-Mini, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Porsche and Volvo all skipped that show.", "description": "Don't expect Volvo and Benz at the Canadian International Auto Show in Toronto next February either", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/montreal-auto-show-2020-volvo-audi-bailing-out-2rd.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
