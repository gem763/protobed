(Photo: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)\n\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard a series of cases on whether or not employers have the legal right to fire gay or transgender people, weighing a federal law that prevents discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits companies from firing people based on their race, color, sex, religion, or nationality, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. But the interpretation of \u201csex\u201d is on the table, with one side arguing that gender identity and sexual orientation are covered under the definition, while the Trump administration disagrees.\n\nIn one case, Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor in New York, who died in 2014 (he is represented by his estate), was fired by his employer after disclosing his sexual orientation to a female student. According to legal papers, Zarda often told female students he was gay to make the experience of being strapped to a man less awkward. But the student\u2019s boyfriend complained to the company and Zarda was fired because he had \u201cfailed to provide an enjoyable experience for a customer.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Zarda\u2019s employer claimed he \u201cinappropriately touched her and disclosed his sexual orientation to excuse his behavior.\u201d Zarda sued his company for violating Title VII, although he died before the court ruled in his favor.\n\nThe second case involves a man named Gerald Bostock, a child welfare services coordinator in Georgia who alleged he was fired from his job for joining a gay softball team. His employer fired him in June 2013, claiming he mismanaged public funds (which Bostock denied in an interview with the Advocate). Although Bostock sued Clayton County on the same grounds as Zarda, his case was dismissed on the basis that sexual orientation isn\u2019t covered under Title VII.\n\nThe third involves Aimee Stephens, who was fired from a Michigan funeral home in 2013 after revealing she was transgender in a letter to her colleagues. \u201cWhat I must tell you is very difficult for me and is taking all the courage I can muster,\u201d Stephens wrote, according to the New York Times. \u201cI have felt imprisoned in a body that does not match my mind, and this has caused me great despair and loneliness.\u201d\n\nThe Times reports that when asked why Stephens was fired, her employer answered, \u201cWell, because he was no longer going to represent himself as a man. He wanted to dress as a woman.\u201d Stephens won her case, reported the Times, with the court ruling, \u201cIt is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee\u2019s status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee\u2019s sex...\u201d\n\nAccording to CNN, on Tuesday, conservatives such as Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Samuel Alito indicated that the issue was more appropriate for Congress. And Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco, who represented the Trump administration argued, \u201cThe ordinary meaning of \u2018sex\u2019 is biologically male or female; it does not include sexual orientation,\u201d reported the Washington Post.\n\nHowever, Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford law professor and co-director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, argued, \"in 1964 you wouldn't find a single dictionary that defined the term 'sexual harassment' and yet the Supreme Court has held that Title VII [of the 1964 Civil Rights Act] prohibits sexual harassment of women,\u201d according to NPR. (Karlan was not immediately available for comment when reached by Yahoo Lifestyle).\n\nA decision regarding the law is expected in 2020. On Monday, actress and LGBTQ advocate Laverne Cox told ABC News that Tuesday\u2019s hearing was \u201cprobably the most consequential case for LBGTQ+ civil rights that the Supreme Court will hear in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nAccording to Charlotte Clymer, press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), LGBTQ employees often have to be cautious \u2014 46 percent say they\u2019re closeted at work, 20 percent have been told or had colleagues suggest they should dress more feminine or masculine, 53 percent say they hear jokes about sexual orientation and gender identity at work \u201cat least once in a while,\u201d and 31 percent feel unhappy or depressed at work, as found in the HRC 2018 A Workplace Divided report.\n\n\u201cLGBTQ people learn to pivot water cooler conversations at work,\u201d Clymer tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWhen asked about family life, one\u2019s answer may include parents or siblings, not a partner.\u201d These scenarios may not directly impact job performance, but career advancement is often built on personal connections.", "description": "The Supreme Court will weigh in on whether transgender and LGBTQ employees are safe from discrimination under a federal law.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oQsAE6Ecmgz1mJWYRyXA.A--~B/aD00MTkyO3c9NjM3MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/ad0b78d0-ea0f-11e9-bbbe-1a4826ce23a2", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
