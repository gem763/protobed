I even booked a hotel for two nights just to get away from the noise.\n\n\u2018In the end I moved house as the landlord was doing nothing about the rats.\u2019\n\nHow to make your home rat-proof STEP 1 \u2013 Check brickwork to ensure air bricks \u2013 which allow ventilation \u2013 are intact as larger Victorian ones have gaps large enough for rodents to sneak through\n\nSTEP 2 \u2013 Remove kick plates from the bottom of kitchen units and clear out any food debris and check for rat droppings\n\nSTEP 3 \u2013 Clear out stair cupboards and check pipework for holes where rodents can sneak in and make a winter nest\n\nSTEP 4 \u2013 Check your loft or attack for signs of \u2018invasion\u2019\n\nSTEP 5 \u2013 Remove garden rubbish and debris which attracts rats and keep a tidy garden\n\nSTEP 6 \u2013 Don\u2019t feed birds by scattering food in your garden as this attracts rats, use specialist bird feeders\n\nSTEP 7 \u2013 Put brush strips on your doors to stop rats getting in\n\nPaul said there were several steps to take to try and stop the rodents sneaking into your home, including blocking any gaps in brickwork and clearing out stair cupboards, as well as putting all food away in cupboards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018It\u2019s so much better to take preventive action now. It\u2019s amazing how often we find external doors that simply don\u2019t fit properly.\n\n\u2018A rat can get through tiny gaps \u2013 and mice can get though a gap as wide as a pencil \u2013 so if there is a gap, make sure you fit a bristle-strip draft excluder to the base.\u2019\n\nBut he warned \u2018no house is completely rodent proof\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
