Our view is that nothing has changed.\u201d\n\nShingange says they\u2019re going to pressure government to be stricter about future bailouts.\n\n\u201cIn order for you to access this funding, [there are] conditions that are supposed to be met, which the board doesn\u2019t seem to be capable of.\u201d\n\nShinngange says if the anc government fails to act- they will be putting the entire future of the country at stake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Cosatu Wants Govt To Put Stricter Conditions For Any Eskom Bailout appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "Cosatu Wants Govt To Put Stricter Conditions For Any Eskom Bailout", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/news_pile_69x52._800x533_L_1419494209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
