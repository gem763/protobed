Among the ornate necklaces, rings, and bracelets he was wearing that fall day, it was the gilded razor blade dangling from his ear and the golden, oversized Wu-Tang Clan symbol swallowing up his hand that seemed to shine the brightest.\n\n\u201cMy pieces are more than just a shiny objects,\u201d he said to me as he looked down at his hands adorned with his own art, \u201cThey actually make a statement and the connection is deep.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old creates socially-conscious accessories under the moniker Johnny Nelson, which is a reverse portmanteau of his first name. The brand has received a great deal of praise this year, especially for its Pyer Moss collaborations.\n\nFor the Met Gala in May, Jamison outfitted Pyer Moss\u2019s designer Kerby Jean-Raymond and Hollywood multi-hyphenate Lena Waith with custom sculpture portrait buttons featuring the faces of hip-hop legends (Jay-Z, Nipsey Hussle, J. Cole\u2026) and LGBTQ icons (RuPaul, Dorian Corey, Freddie Pendavis...). They wore the buttons on streamlined zoot suits with exaggerated shoulders that were inspired by the film Malcolm X and perfectly fit the evening\u2019s \u201ccamp\u201d theme.\n\n\u201cPeople saw the buttons at the Met and now they want the lapel pins or cuff links,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot more orders\u2014custom orders, because it really opened up the creativity of the consumer. Now they are the designer.\u201d\n\nAnd in September for Pyer Moss\u2019s 2020 \u201cSister\u201d show for New York Fashion Week, Jamison helped Jean-Raymond achieve his goal of reclaiming rock n\u2019 roll. Jamison did it by enshrining the faces of 20 iconic black women performing artists (Nina Simone, Diana Ross, Missy Elliot\u2026) into golden hair beads, earrings, and sweeping necklaces that accessorized the vibrant, glamorous looks streaming down the runway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so lit for my first runway show to be with Pyer Moss. That was such an epic moment,\u201d he said of the show, which was hosted in his native Brooklyn at the Kings Theatre in Flatbush. \u201cIt was so packed out there, it was like going to Empire Skating rink on a Friday night back in the day.\u201d\n\nHis work with Pyer Moss has certainly increased his profile as a jewelry designer. But even more importantly than the business side of things, the show in September was a sign to himself and his loved ones of how far he\u2019s come in his life and proof that the work he\u2019s done to heal from past tribulations is paying off.\n\nJamison was born in London and raised in Brooklyn. His childhood was typified by a tremendous amount of love at home provided by two artistic parents. His mom Glenice, who hails from the UK and knows how to dress like a diva on a budget, fostered his love of aesthetics and design and taught him how to make his own jewelry. While his dad Matthew, a native New Yorker who plays the church organ and makes hip-hop beats, gave him a passion for music that is still reflected in the jewelry he makes today.\n\nBut outside the home, he had to contend with a number of traumatic experiences that nearly squelched his creative potential.\n\nOne of the most wretched instances happened in 2004. Jamison and his friends were standing on the subway platform after catching a showing of Jay Z\u2019s Fade to Black documentary, when they were approached by an NYPD officer who demanded that they leave. When they refused, the cop pepper sprayed the boys. After Jamison\u2019s friend Mitchi Cunningham demanded the officer\u2019s badge number, the cop struck the child.\n\n\u201cThe officer took out his baton, and he cracked my friend in the head,\u201d said Jamison. \u201cSlow blood started pouring out. I have never seen anything like that in my life.\u201d When Jamison tried to get help from another police officer, he was arrested and taken to jail. Cunningham had to receive neurosurgery as a result. While the boys eventually received a financial settlement from the city, the impact of that moment stayed with Jamison forever.\n\nFour years later, when Jamison was 20 and starting to make a name for himself as a rapper, he was again attacked by the NYPD officers who caught him urinating in public. He told me they pummeled him senselessly.\n\n\u201cMy tooth went through my lip. But they just kept going.\u201d he said to me. \u201cThat was the most helpless I ever felt. They are supposed to be the people you call when you need help. But what do you do when they are the people hurting you?\u201d\n\nAfter being charged for assault, Jamison considered suing the NYPD again. But he decided against it because he believed his rap career would take off.\n\nHe was right. His street single \u201cPut Em in a Body Bag,\u201d which he recorded under the name Johnny Nelson, became a viral hit in the early 2010s, enabling him to tour alongside notable acts of the era like Ninjasonik. However, the trauma from those two events with the NYPD still weighed heavy on his psyche.\n\n\u201cI realize now that I probably have PTSD,\u201d he said to me almost with disbelief.\n\nTo cope with his demons, Johnny turned to alcohol, which he indulged in more as his profile grew as an MC. \u201cWith partying, it\u2019s so easy to get lost and forget what your path is,\u201d he said.\n\nBut then, in short succession, he was hit with two wake-up calls. The first was the death of his close friend Ditto Castillo, who went by the name Ease Daman. Castillo was a fellow artist, who made rap music and worked for streetwear brands like Mishka. He died in 2013 due to complications with drugs. For Jamison, Castillo\u2019s passing helped put the consequences of substance abuse into perspective.\n\nThe second was a brain hemorrhage Jamison suffered in 2015 caused most likely by a fight, but he doesn\u2019t remember with whom or how it started because he was wasted at the time. \u201cI was unconscious for days,\u201d he said, \u201cThat messed me up. \u201d\n\nBut things began to turn around for Jamison in 2016, when he quit alcohol cold turkey after a marathon recording session with Melo X. As positive things started to happen, it reaffirmed the notion that being sober was the lifestyle for him.\n\n\u201cIf you always had potential and you have people who look up to you,\u201d he said, \u201cThen no matter how far you fall, you have to get back up.\u201d\n\nLooking for a new way to express himself and make a living, Jamison turned to jewelry because people always loved the way he accessorized when he was rapping on stage.\n\n\u201cI used to throw parties with Ojay Morgan of the Zebra Katz and I would always wear these matches in my ear to those events. People would really look for that and tell me how fire it was,\u201d he said with a laugh as he described the genesis of his Forever Lit earring, which features a metallic red enamel tip. \u201cI had so much faith in this from the beginning because I already knew how successful it would be.\u201d\n\nAs Jamison dove deeper into jewelry design, he relied on personal connections and mentors to help him realize his vision. \u201cI basically went out to the diamond district and started asking around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building relationships. I\u2019ve become real close to people throughout the industry.\u201d\n\nThis is especially true of other black designers in jewelry, since there are so few. \u201cWe all share what we know because it\u2019s so hard to get stuff out here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I meet a black jeweler, I\u2019ll ask homegirl, \u2018Where do you go to get your plating done?\u201d And she might ask me where I get something else popping. We\u2019re not afraid to share with each other.\u201d\n\nIn terms of design, Jamison feels his biggest breakthrough was his four-finger rings that feature iconic faces. To make them, Jamison starts with Adobe Illustrator. \u201cI take pictures of their faces and put them together to see how they would line up on a hand,\u201d he said. After that, it\u2019s time to work by hand, carving the faces out of wax, which is used to make prototypes. This part of the process can take weeks.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a lot of faith to prototype jewelry,\u201d said Jamison. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trial and error and it\u2019s expensive because you\u2019re working with metals.\u201d When the prototype is finished, he\u2019s able to make a silicone mold, which can be used to reproduce the ring in greater numbers with relative ease.\n\nThe first four-finger ring he started out with was Gold Rush, a piece that shrunk the presidential monument of Mount Rushmore down to the scale of the hand. \u201cI made that just to grab attention and have people connect with something that they\u2019ve never seen,\u201d he said.\n\nTowards the end of 2016, he started working on a hip-hop Mount Rushmore, focusing on rappers who touched him and also brought unique elements to the overall culture. Because the ring was a collection of faces, he was particularly focused on highlighting the artists\u2019 \u201ccrown chakras.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where information and creativity comes from,\u201d said the designer, before describing the unique crown of each icon on the ring. \u201cBiggie is wearing a literal crown. Tupac has a bandanna. ODB has his wild crazy hair, and wild style in general. And Eazy-Z has his baseball cap, which kind of represents that he is like a man of many hats. He wasn\u2019t just a rapper, he was NWA\u2019s businessman.\u201d\n\nBut the conjoined piece that speaks to him and his experiences most explicitly is his Let Freedom Ring, which features the faces of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, and Frederick Douglas. \u201cThis is my space to actually speak,\u201d he said to me of the ring, \u201cabout the injustices I have been through firsthand with racism and police brutality. This ring starts that conversation.\u201d\n\nHe also hopes these sorts of pieces give people who are facing the same obstacles that he faced strength to persevere. \u201cPeople are powered by this jewelry,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might cop a Marcus Garvey piece, and then want to open up their own business.\u201d\n\nHe believes the power comes from the iconic figures he\u2019s honoring. \u201cDeath doesn\u2019t stop their energy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even though they didn\u2019t finish what they came to do, their legacy lives on through us.\u201d\n\nBut as important as the political element of his work is to him, his newfound platform has also allowed him to show love to those who stood beside him during his heralding journey to this point in his life.\n\nAt the Pyer Moss show in September, instead of bringing a romantic partner or a friend, the designer brought his mom Glenice as his date. For the special day, the stylish mom matched her vintage Gucci belt and kimono with earrings and a necklace designed by her son.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, she had to pick me up from jail,\u201d he said with a dark laugh. \u201cGoing from that to being able to take her to a runway show that I was actually a part of\u2014and her being the one who taught me everything I know about style\u2014it was just a huge moment.\u201d\n\nBut as successful as the designer is today, he\u2019s still committed to working through his trauma so that he can continue to manifest more of his success. Now that he\u2019s done with alcohol (he ordered a seltzer water from the bar at the Dumbo House), he\u2019s studying organic healing techniques, practicing meditation, and considering more traditional forms of counseling. All of this work is, in his words, to go back into his past and face the root of his pain.\n\n\u201cAll of these blessings have been happening because I have gotten past a lot of the bad stuff in life,\u201d he said with a sigh of relief, \u201cI\u2019m doing the work that I need to do on myself, which is why the jewelry I make is always purposeful.\u201d", "description": "After a series of struggles, Johnel Jamison found his purpose in silver and gold portrait pieces that celebrate figures from Missy Elliott to Octavia St. Laurent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9df1f467056e000a34956d/lede/1570633240869-johnny-nelson-jewlery.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7185xh;0xw,0.0422xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
