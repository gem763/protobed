But Trump says the Kurds deserve what they\u2019re getting. Five times since the invasion began, he scoffed that they\u2019re \u201cno angels.\u201d He accused them of releasing ISIS prisoners \u201cjust for effect,\u201d to embarrass and scare the United States. The Turks had every right to invade Kurdish land along their border, said Trump: \u201cThey had to have it cleaned out.\u201d\n\nWhat about all the people driven from their homes? \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of sand,\u201d the president shrugged, referring to Syria and the countries fighting over it. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d The only thing Trump cares about is what\u2019s under the ground: oil. On Monday, he recalled that in the Iraq war, \u201cI always said, If you\u2019re going in, keep the oil. Same thing here: Keep the oil. We want to keep the oil.\u201d He proposed a \u201ccash flow\u201d deal between the Kurds and an American oil conglomerate of his choosing. \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out with the Kurds so that they have some money,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly.\u201d On Friday, he lied, \u201cWe just did a great thing in Syria. \u2026 We took over oil. A lot of great things are happening.\u201d\n\nWhile celebrating the Kurds\u2019 pain and proposing to exploit them financially, Trump also suggested that European countries deserved whatever terrorism they might suffer at the hands of ISIS prisoners liberated by the invasion.", "description": "", "authors": ["William Saletan", "Slate.Com News-And-Politics Trump-Says-Death-Good-Kurds-Turkey.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
