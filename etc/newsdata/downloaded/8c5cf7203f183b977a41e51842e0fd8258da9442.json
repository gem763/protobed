However if a stone becomes trapped in the opening of the gallbladder, it can trigger sudden, intense pain in the abdomen.\n\nSome people with gallstones also develop severe complications. The gallbladder can become inflamed, resulting in persistent pain, jaundice and a high temperature. Acute pancreatitis can also occur.\n\nMedication is not prescribed very often as it doesn\u2019t work for most people. The most effective treatment is removal of the gallbladder. The organ is not essential and people can live a normal life without one.\n\nHowever, studies suggest up to 18 per cent of people who undergo surgical removal of this pouch will have at least one stone still trapped in their bile duct, the tube that attaches the gallbladder to the intestines. This can cause the pancreas to become inflamed and prove fatal \u2013 which is why the stones must be removed first.\n\nThis is usually done during an endoscopic procedure, which involves inserting a flexible tube through the mouth and down into the stomach.\n\nA cut is made at the opening of the bile duct and the trapped stones are cleared. The gallbladder is taken out a few weeks later in a separate operation. But in the gap between procedures, some patients suffer another attack of gallstones, which then need to be cleared again, further delaying recovery.\n\nWHAT ARE GALLSTONES? Gallstones are lumps of sold material that form in the gallbladder. In the UK, up to one in 10 adults have the condition. It affects around 15 per cent of people in the US. Gallstones can resemble grains of sand or large pebbles. They are formed from chemicals in bile and can consist of just cholesterol, a mixture of calcium and a pigment from red blood cells, or a combination of the two. Gallstones have been linked to high-cholesterol diets, as well as liver damage and fasting. Most people are unaware they have gallstones. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, which can last up to eight hours and be severe. This may be mistaken for a heart attack. Pain occurs due to the gallbladder trying to expel the stones. If gallstones have been discovered via a scan for something else and are not causing symptoms, they are often left without treatment. Gallbladder inflammation may require antibiotics to be administered in hospital. Severe symptoms may lead to people having the organ removed. The gallbladder, which is involved in digestion, is not essential for life.

This technology will help more and more patients have their gallstones treated, and gallbladder removed, in one procedure.\u2019\n\nThe procedure \u2013 known as laser assisted bile duct exploration by laparoendoscopy, or LABEL \u2013 is carried out under general anaesthetic. Five tiny incisions are made on the patient\u2019s stomach and a scope \u2013 a small tube containing a 3mm-wide camera \u2013 is inserted through one into the cystic duct, which joins the gallbladder and bile duct.\n\nA laser fibre is then threaded through a channel of the scope and the instrument is moved into the bile duct to locate the trapped stones. Short bursts of energy are emitted to blast the stones into tiny pieces which are retrieved in a basket.\n\nFinally, the gallbladder is cut from the bile duct and removed.\n\nA clip is put in place to close up the end of the bile duct at the end of the operation.\n\nPatients are generally well enough to go home the next day.\n\nMargaret O\u2019Sullivan, 83, from Harrow, was left in agony and lost three stone in weight when gallstones became lodged in her bile duct in March last year.\n\n\u2018It got so bad I didn\u2019t care if I lived,\u2019 the mother-of-four says.\n\n\u2018I only had to eat a mouthful of food and I\u2019d get the most excruciating pain in my stomach that would last for days on end.\n\n\u2018It got so bad at one stage that I couldn\u2019t even drink a cup of soup and the bouts would last round the clock, several days at a time. I stopped eating to avoid the pain.\u2019\n\nShe underwent the procedure in April, was home three days later and is now pain-free.\n\nLuckily, her appetite has fully returned. \u2018I\u2019m tucking into all those things I couldn\u2019t eat before \u2013 like pate,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s heaven.\u2019", "description": "Surgeons at London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust are using lasers to blast away stones before taking out the gallblader in a single procedure.", "authors": ["Sally Wardle For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/18/19924564-0-image-a-14_1571505390354.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
