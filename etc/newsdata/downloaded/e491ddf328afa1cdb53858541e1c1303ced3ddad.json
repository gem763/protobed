I\u2019ll name one play on these retirement-changing investments in a moment. This unusual fund yields an outsized 5.1% today and sets us up for a \u201csteady as she goes\u201d triple-digit gain, too.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk a little more about the tax side of \u201cmuni\u201d bonds: these investments pay a 100% tax-free dividend (so their \u201creal\u201d yields could be much higher for you, depending on your tax bracket).\n\nThis underestimated benefit is written right into the tax code as an incentive to get investors to pile cash into hospitals, bridges, and other badly needed infrastructure. So a selection of munis can be a boon to your retirement, amping up your income and adding much-needed ballast to your nest egg in a market storm.\n\nInvest Alongside Wall Street Titans (Tax-Free)\n\nHere\u2019s a little-known fact about munis: when towns, cities and states issue them, they call a select group of customers first\u2014and these lucky buyers get first crack at the best bonds, leaving everyone else out in the cold.\n\nAnd no, those priority customers aren\u2019t regular folks like you and me. They\u2019re titans like PIMCO and BlackRock (NYSE: ), who invest trillions in muni bonds. But this doesn\u2019t mean muni bonds are an elite money-maker we\u2019re shut out of. Far from it!\n\nBecause if we can\u2019t beat the big guys, we\u2019re going to join them \u2026 by buying their funds.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to buy a muni-bond index fund like the iShares National AMT-Free Muni Bond (NYSE: ), though. Because doing so is almost guaranteed to hand us inferior returns.\n\nInstead, we\u2019re going to get our muni fix through a special kind of fund called a closed-end fund (CEF). This automatically sets us up to outperform the passive crowd:\n\nMUB CEF Annualized Returns\n\nAs you can see, MUB gave investors just a 3.7% annualized return over the last decade, while actively managed muni-bond CEFs delivered a much bigger 6.2%. In fact, only two of 138 muni-bond CEFs that have been around for a decade or more have underperformed MUB over that time period.\n\nWhy? Because these funds are managed by BlackRock (NYSE: ), PIMCO and other bond giants\u2014companies that get preferential treatment when new munis come on the scene.\n\nA 5.1% Dividend That \u201cTransforms\u201d Into an 8.4% Cash Stream\n\nIt isn\u2019t just total returns that are bigger. MUB\u2019s 2.3% dividend yield is better than you\u2019d get from stocks, but it\u2019s much less than the average 4.1% yield across muni-bond CEFs. And with yields as high as 5.1%, income from muni-bond CEFs can get pretty lofty, especially when you consider that a 5.1% muni dividend is the same as an 8.4% yield if you\u2019re in the highest tax bracket.\n\nBy the way, that 5.1% yield is from the Nuveen Municipal High IOF (NYSE: ), which also happens to be one of the top performers over the long haul.\n\nThe Index Doesn\u2019t Stand a Chance\n\nNMZ MUB Total Return Chart\n\nWith MUB well behind NMZ and yielding less, what\u2019s the point of even considering the index fund? Furthermore, NMZ recently raised its dividend, and more dividend increases are likely to come as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.\n\nWhy? Because more investors are going to be looking for yield, and as the crowd comes to muni bonds, profits from muni-bond funds will grow. Hence NMZ\u2019s monster 2019:\n\nMore Demand = More Profits for NMZ\n\nNMZ MUB 12m Total Return Chart\n\nAfter a near 20% return in less than a year from a low-volatility investment, you might be wondering if it\u2019s too late to get into muni bonds. But if we zoom out a bit, we can clearly see that this isn\u2019t the case.\n\nStill a Great Time to Buy NMZ\n\nNMZ Price Change Chart\n\nOver the last three years, NMZ has earned an annualized 5.2%, which is far below its 10-year average annual return of 7.9%. In other words, NMZ\u2019s real profit potential isn\u2019t yet priced in.\n\nThat\u2019s because investors have ignored NMZ for a long time, due to the Federal Reserve.\n\nFrom 2015 to late 2018, the Fed entered a period of rising interest rates, which scared muni-bond investors. The idea was that higher Treasury yields would entice investors away from munis and into Treasuries.\n\nFurthermore, there were rumors during the 2016 election that the tax-free status munis have enjoyed for decades would be scrapped. That obviously never happened, but the resulting muni selloff resulted in a heavily discounted asset class that has taken years to recover. And now that the Fed is cutting rates, the biggest bear case for munis is gone, causing that recovery to intensify.\n\nThat rebound still isn\u2019t over, which is why you can jump into a tax-free yielder like NMZ and expect capital gains as the market realizes just how wonderful these funds\u2019 tax-free income can be.\n\nThese 8.8% Dividends Fit Perfectly With NMZ\n\nNMZ is just the start: I want to give you four more funds that hand you even more dividend income\u2014I\u2019m talking a blockbuster 8.8% average yield.\n\nPlus, these funds are so cheap now, they\u2019re \u201cspring-loaded\u201d for 20%+ price upside in the next year.\n\nSo if, say, you invested $200K in this diversified collection of income powerhouses now, you\u2019d be looking at a cool $17,600 in dividend cash by this time next year\u2014and $40,000 in price upside too!\n\nBut these 4 income powerhouses won\u2019t be cheap for long\u2014especially with the Fed determined to keep cutting interest rates, which will drive more income-starved investors into the CEF market.\n\nDisclosure: Brett Owens and Michael Foster are contrarian income investors who look for undervalued stocks/funds across the U.S. markets.
