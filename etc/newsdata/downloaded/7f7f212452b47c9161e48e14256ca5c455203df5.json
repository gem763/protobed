Tarayle Glick, 19; Donte Slash, 23; and Clinedinst\u2019s former roommate, 52-year-old Abraham Shears, who was kicked out of the same house about a month ago and allegedly plotted the murder.\n\nShears and Clinedinst lived in the home with two other women but the landlord allegedly kicked Shears and another woman out of the premises about a month ago, according to investigators.\n\n\"There was always constant turmoil and the sheriff\u2019s department was out here several times because of him,\" said Chaffin of Shears.\n\nAccording to a sworn affidavit filed by the sheriff\u2019s office and obtained by CBS station WBNS, Slash and Glick allegedly waited outside Clinedinst\u2019s home at about 3:30 a.m., when the victim would typically leave to go to work.\n\nGlick then allegedly used a flashlight to blind Clinedinst before Slash stabbed him several times. Both men then fled the scene of the crime.\n\nShears allegedly offered Glick and Slash an undisclosed amount of money and pay for their travel to California if they killed Clinedinst, according to the affidavit.\n\nSecurity cameras mounted on the front of the house but they were not working at the time of the attack and there is no surveillance footage, detectives told WSYX.\n\nGlick and Slash face charges of murder. Shears is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, police said.\n\nColumbus City Schools Director of Communications Jacqueline Bryant released a statement to WSYX.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Clinedinst family during this difficult time. Bus drivers such as Mr. Clinedinst do more than just transport students safely to and from school. They are the first to greet students as they head to school each day, and extend a positive school climate beyond the classroom. It\u2019s the power of those short morning interactions that can set the tone for a child\u2019s day,\" read the statement.\n\nThe community is still in shock over Clinedinst\u2019s murder.\n\n\"I just can\u2019t believe somebody had that kind of anger to viciously attack a person and kill him,\" a neighbor said.", "description": "A school bus driver was stabbed to death by two on his own front doorstep in an alleged murder-for-hire plot concocted by a former roommate.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/police-tape-gty-jt-181007_hpMain_4_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
