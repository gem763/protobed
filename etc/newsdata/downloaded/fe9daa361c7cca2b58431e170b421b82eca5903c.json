Across the globe, immigrants sent $583 billion back to their home countries in 2014, with $440 billion of that going to developing countries. Remittances usually form just a small fraction of a country\u2019s national GDP, but they still accounted for almost four times the $135 billion in global foreign aid that was disbursed last year. In the following map, you can click on any country to see where it immigrants living there send money home.\n\nAnd Trump isn\u2019t the only one with his eye on remittance payments. World leaders who recognize the importance of the remittance industry in their economies include Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose recent visit to the United Arab Emirates put the issue in the spotlight as he worked to attract greater foreign investment in India. This is for good reason, since remittances tend to increase in times of recession while other forms of investment decrease, as tougher times at home can elicity more money from friends and family abroad. India receives about $12 billion in remittances from the UAE, and remittances from the broader Gulf region play a significant part in the economy of South Indian states like Kerala.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s plan to confiscate the remittances of undocumented workers may be impractical\u2014not to mention controversial\u2014global remittances provide an interesting look at how immigrants in the U.S. and beyond are lifting people from their own countries out of poverty by sending money home. The practice is most prevalent in Tajikistan, which receives about 40 percent of its national GDP in the form of remittances.\n\nMethodology\n\nRemittances and migration unit data are provided by the World Bank Group. The estimates of total migrant population were obtained from the World Bank\u2019s Bilateral-Remittance matrix. The estimates in this data set are compiled from various primary and secondary sources for international migrant population and remittance outflows, and may in some cases fail to capture the complete volumes of remittances.
