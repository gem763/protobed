They can also control elements within the vehicle, such as temperature control or music choice.\n\nI\u2019m no Luddite, but in the era of Facebook data scandals and computer hacking by mischief-makers, I\u2019m a bit wary of such \u2018spy in the car\u2019 technology.\n\nBut it does work. Some fellow testers who struggled to get the sat-nav to cooperate manually simply asked \u2019Hey Mercedes\u2019 to get them to their destination - and it did.\n\nThe navigation display features augmented reality technology which overlays navigation data with real images from the vehicle\u2019s cameras, making navigation easier and more effective.\n\nWearing a smart coupe-like body, the A-Class has taken many of its cabin styling and quality cues from bigger Mercedes\n\nLater in the year there will be the option for around \u00a31,700 of a hi-tech autonomous \u2018driving assistance \u2019package which boasts the same tech as the flagship S-Class, which allows it to drive \u2018semi-autonomously\u2019 in certain situations.\n\nThis includes slowing down automatically at bends, junctions and roundabouts, braking if it spots crossing traffic or pedestrians, slowing down and accelerating in moving traffic or approaching jams, and steering autonomously.\n\nIf the driver presses the indicator for two seconds on a multi-lane highway, the car can overtake automatically and then retune to its lane. If the driver takes his or her hands off the wheel for 30 seconds, they will be warned to put them back on.\n\nMercedes describes the styling as \u2018modern avant-garde\u2019 with the electronic dashboard display prominent under a large swathe of glass. That also includes the multi-function steering wheel with touchpads and a fully-digital cockpit display.\n\nIt does feel young, fresh, contemporary and yet also rather grown up \u2013 but in a premium quality way that is sophisticated rather than boring \u2018sensible shoes\u2019.\n\nBeneath the screen and at either side of the dashboard are large cool and cooling air vents that resemble aircraft turbine blades.\n\nYakety yak: Hey Mercedes is the voice-activated intelligent driving assistant in the A-Class tested out by Ray Massey, who worried about it talking back\n\nThe sporty seats are comfortable, the discrete metal switches a delight and the door-handle side grips are in just the right place.\n\nThe moment I fired up the engine and travelled just a few hundred yards down the road I was surprised and delighted that it actually felt more powerful and engaging than I was expecting.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for British drivers and customers. For, amazingly, the UK is the world\u2019s biggest market for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class \u2013 with more than 43,000 of the existing model sold in Britain last year - ahead even of its home patch in Germany.\n\nAll told, more than 3 million A-Classes have been sold world-wide since launch in 1997 \u2013 of which 334,000 were bought in the UK.\n\nIndeed, so important is the UK market to the German ca -giant that they even wheeled out the firm\u2019s engaging chief executive Dr Dieter Zetscher, one of the motor industry\u2019s real giants, for a chat with the Brits during the car\u2019s global launch in Croatia.\n\nThe latest new A-Class is the fourth generation of the upmarket hatchback in just over two decades, the first two of which featured distinctive high-sided wedge-shaped styling.\n\nBut it has been the new and outgoing model, on sale since 2012 and more akin to a hatchback with coupe-like styling, which has proved the great hit and brought down the average age of owners by ten years.\n\nOn sale now with first customer deliveries from late May, the new model\u2019s exterior is not a radical departure from the one it replaces.\n\nIt is available in three trim levels \u2013 SE, Sport, and the highest AMG Line, with three additional packages of equipment extras adding thousands of pounds to the bill.\n\nMore than half the new A-Class sales are expected to be automatics and in the top level trim.\n\nThe new model is slightly longer, wider and more spacious, with improved shoulder, elbow and headroom, and better all-round visibility.\n\nIt\u2019s bright inside with plenty of space in the back for passengers and a fair bit of head-room for such an aerodynamically-shaped car.\n\nThe all new A-Class cars come as standard with a pair of seven inch dashboard touchscreens showing instrument dials, entertainment, sat-nav and other settings.\n\nThe interior of the new A-Class is tech heavy with a large touch screen\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of one or two 10.25-inch screens. All are housed under one sheet of glass to creating a dramatic widescreen cockpit display. Automatic braking assist and automatic lane keeping are also standard on all models, which spells good news for its safety standards.\n\n2018 Mercedes-Benz A-Class: Will it fit in my garage? Price: from \u00a325,800 First deliveries: Late May/early June Length: 4419mm Width: 1796mm Height: 1440mm Luggage space: 370 litres (up 29 litres) A200 auto petrol Price: from \u00a327,500 Engine: New 1.4 litre 4 cylinder turbocharged petrol engine Power: 163 horse-power Top speed: 139 mph 0-62mph: 8 seconds MPG: 51.4 mpg Gears: 7-speed automatic CO2 emissions: 123g/km A180d diesel Price: from \u00a325,800 Engine: 1.5 litre, 4 cylinder diesel Power: 116 horse-power Top speed: 125mph 0-62mph: 10.5 seconds MPG: 68.9mpg Gears: 7-speed automatic CO2 emissions: 108g/km A250 petrol Price: from \u00a330,240 Engine: 2.0 litre 4 cylinder turbo-charged petrol Power: 224 horse-power Top speed: 155mph 0-62mph: 6.2 seconds MPG: 45.6 mpg Gears: 7-speed automatic CO2 emissions: 141g/km To follow later: Manual 6-speed versions 2.0 litre diesel with 9-speed automatic Petrol electric hybrid version\n\nBoot space is pretty generous and increased by 29 litres to a maximum of 370 litres with the seats in place, and 1,210 litres with the rear seats down.\n\nThe loading bay is 20cm wider. But unless you have electric assistance fitted, the rear hatch is quite heavy to open and close manually.\n\nThe launch models feature three engines \u2013 two petrol and one diesel \u2013 all linked to seven speed automatic gearboxes.\n\nAround 70 percent of all previous generation A-Classes sold in the UK so far have had a diesel engine, though in the current climate that is likely to drop with a swing towards more petrol. How far that will be, Mercedes-Benz admit they don\u2019t know.\n\nI first drove the new 180d diesel powered by a smooth but engaging 116 horse-power 1.5 litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine which was so quiet I had to double check it really was a diesel.\n\nPriced from \u00a325,800, its quoted average fuel efficiency of 68.9mpg and low C02 emissions of 108g/km will make it a particular favourite with high-mileage company car buyers.\n\nIt accelerates from rest to 62mph in 10.5 seconds up to a top speed of 125mph but feels quicker.\n\nIt is particularly fast off the mark in the lower range, with added fun when switching to manual over-ride using the steering wheel paddles. It\u2019s a smooth operator but surprisingly perky and well balanced and nimble on mountain roads with a good blast of power if you need it when overtaking.\n\nFor the diesel averse private buyer it is the A200 that\u2019s likely to be a hit. Powered by a sprightly 163 horsepower 1.4 litre four-cylinder turbo-charged petrol engine, it accelerates from rest to 62mph in a useful eight seconds and has a top speed of 139mph, but still promises average fuel economy of 51.4mpg and CO2 emissions of 123g/km. Well-mannered but fun when you want it to be, it is priced from \u00a327,280.\n\nFor a bit more oomph \u2013 and a \u00a330,240 price tag to match - there\u2019s the A250 with a 224 horsepower from a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine that takes it from rest to 62mph in just 6.2 seconds with a top speed of 155mph, claimed average fuel consumption of 45.6mpg and CO2 emissions of 141g/km.\n\nTwo more 2.0 litre diesel variants linked to 9-speed automatic gear-boxes (200d and 220d) arrive early next year with a petrol-electric hybrid version to follow by the end of the year.\n\nMercedes says the A-Class has a lower average age of buyers than its other cars\n\nJust don\u2019t mention the elk-test. Twenty years ago Mercedes-Benz launched with great fanfare what was then the first radical new wedge-shaped A-Class super-mini.\n\nIt was all going swimmingly until a group of road test journalists carried out a manoeuvre, involving tight evasive turns through a set of cones, designed to check whether the car could successfully avoid an elk or moose out in the wilds of Scandinavia.\n\nNot only did it fail, it did so in spectacular fashion, flipping over. Mercedes-Benz countered the problem by adding electronic stability controls.\n\nThankfully, the new A-Class has come a long way since then. And it really does deserve a top of the class A-grade.", "description": "In an age where for many car buyers it\u2019s as much about the interior feel of a car and its technology, Mercedes has set those purchasers firmly in its sights with the new A-Class.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
