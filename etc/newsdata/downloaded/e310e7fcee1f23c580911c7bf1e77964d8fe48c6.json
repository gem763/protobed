If 1.5 degrees of warming marked an unambiguous dividing line between a \u201chealthy\u201d climate and total ecological catastrophe \u2014 which is to say, an equal-opportunity extinction event that would wipe out Xi Jinping\u2019s daughter and Barron Trump just as surely as it would peasants in Bangladesh \u2014 then carbon-dioxide emissions probably wouldn\u2019t have risen by 2.7 percent last year. The absence of a single do-or-die climate deadline, from which no country or class is exempt, enables complacency and procrastination, especially among the aging plutocrats who rule so much of our world.\n\nMeanwhile, the ambiguities and inequities of the ecological crisis also pose challenges for mobilizing activists behind climate action. The facts of our predicament don\u2019t always make for punchy slogans. No one is ever going to rally a crowd by pumping her fist and shouting:\n\n\u201cWe have already burned an unsafe amount of carbon, and nothing we do now is likely to prevent the climate from growing evermore inhospitable for the rest of our lives. We cannot know with certainty quite how much ecological devastation we\u2019ve already bought ourselves, or exactly how much carbon we can burn without triggering mass starvation, civilizational collapse, or human extinction. Those 1.5- and two-degree warming targets you\u2019ve heard so much about are informed by science, but they\u2019re still inescapably arbitrary. Keeping warming below 1.5 degrees won\u2019t be sufficient to prevent wrenching ecological disruptions (some of which will be tantamount to \u201cend of the world\u201d for those most severely afflicted). And at the rate we\u2019re going, we almost certainly not going to keep warming below even two degrees, anyway. A better climate (than our current one) is not possible; at least, not for us, or our children, or their children. But the faster we decarbonize the global economy, the better our chances of sparing the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities from near-term destruction \u2014 and our civilization from medium-term collapse \u2014 will be.\u201d\n\nSo, instead, climate activists say things like, \u201cWe have 12 years to save the planet.\u201d And heads of state solemnly swear to \u201csolve\u201d climate change by keeping warming below two degrees. We tell ourselves stories in order to do politics.\n\nBut Jonathan Franzen is sick of it. In an essay for the New Yorker, the novelist takes exception to the left\u2019s \u201cpretending\u201d on climate change. Franzen argues that when figures like Ocasio-Cortez frame the Green New Deal as \u201cour last chance to avert catastrophe and save the planet,\u201d they are promulgating a form of climate denial because there is no serious prospect of humanity keeping warming below two degrees, and thus \u201cthe radical destabilization of life on earth\u201d is already inevitable. Instead of imagining that a globe-spanning revolution is waiting in the wings, Franzen implores environmentalists to accept that the political dynamics that have obstructed climate action for the past three decades aren\u2019t going to disappear in the next 16 months. The \u201cwar on climate change\u201d is no longer \u201cwinnable.\u201d Activists should carry on fighting to reduce emissions through \u201chalf measures,\u201d the novelist explains, since it is still possible to delay the onset of apocalypse. But it no longer makes sense for the left to insist that climate change must be \u201ceveryone\u2019s overriding priority forever\u201d \u2014 or that \u201cgargantuan renewable-energy projects\u201d must take precedence over the conservation of \u201cliving ecosystems.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of problems with Franzen\u2019s thinking on this subject. But the biggest \u2014 and most ironic \u2014 is that the novelist has himself mistaken politically expedient rhetorical tropes for scientific truths.\n\nSome of Franzen\u2019s arguments bear a vague resemblance to cogent points.\n\nBefore looking at where Franzen goes astray, however, it\u2019s worth noting what he gets half-right. Franzen writes that climate change is already guaranteed to produce \u201cthe radical destabilization of life on earth \u2014 massive crop failures, apocalyptic fires, imploding economies, epic flooding, hundreds of millions of refugees fleeing regions made uninhabitable by extreme heat or permanent drought.\u201d It is unclear what it means, scientifically, for a flood to be \u201cepic,\u201d or a fire, \u201capocalyptic.\u201d But I imagine many residents of Houston, Texas, or Butte County, California, would say that much of Franzen\u2019s dark prophecy has already been realized. And the warming we\u2019ve already bought ourselves will likely be sufficient to implode some economies, cause significant crop failures, and displace large masses of people. If these are the defining features of climate disaster, then climate disaster is already inevitable. And one can plausibly argue that progressive rhetoric elides how much trouble we\u2019re already in. Climate reporter Emily Atkin assembled a version of that case for The New Republic last year:\n\n\u201cThe whole idea that everything\u2019s going to work out isn\u2019t really helpful, because it isn\u2019t going to work out,\u201d said Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Climate change is going to worsen to a point where millions of lives, homes, and species are put at risk, she said. The only thing humans can do is decide how many lives, homes, and species they\u2019re willing to lose due to climate change \u2014 how long they\u2019re willing to allow their respective governments to stall on what we know to be technically achievable.\n\nFurther, Franzen\u2019s assessment of our prospects for averting two degrees of temperature rise is very likely correct. If every signatory of the Paris Agreement honored its emission-reduction commitment under the accord, the Earth would still be at least three degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels by 2100. And only a tiny fraction of signatories are on pace to honor those commitments.\n\nThus, Franzen\u2019s pessimism on this score is neither uncommon nor novel. In fact, New York Times climate reporter Brad Plumer declared that keeping warming below two degrees was all but impossible back in 2014 (when he was still writing for Vox):\n\nBy now, countries have delayed action for so long that the necessary emissions cuts will have to be extremely sharp. In April 2014, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that if we want to stay below the 2\u00b0C limit, global greenhouse-gas emissions would have to decline between 1.3 percent and 3.1 percent each year, on average, between 2010 and 2050.\n\nTo put that in perspective, global emissions declined by just 1 percent for a single year after the 2008 financial crisis, during a brutal recession when factories and buildings around the world were idling. To stay below 2\u00b0C, we may have to triple that pace of cuts, and sustain it year after year.\n\n\u2026 \u201cTen years ago, it was possible to model a path to 2\u00b0C without all these heroic assumptions,\u201d says Peter Frumhoff of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cBut because we\u2019ve dallied for so long, that\u2019s no longer true.\u201d\n\nFive years later, the path to two degrees requires assumptions even more heroic. So, Franzen is probably right that we aren\u2019t going to keep warming below that threshold. He\u2019s just badly wrong about what that means.\n\nFranzen\u2019s understanding of climate science could use a few corrections.\n\nEven as the author mocks the baseless optimism of progressive rhetoric on climate, he treats the center-left\u2019s most convenient rhetorical contrivance on the subject as gospel: that two degrees of warming (give or take) marks a \u201cpoint of no return,\u201d at which the climate \u201cspins completely out of control,\u201d and near-term civilizational collapse becomes inevitable. \u201cIn the long run, it probably makes no difference how badly we overshoot two degrees,\u201d Franzen writes. \u201c[O]nce the point of no return is passed, the world will become self-transforming.\u201d\n\nThis is extremely wrong. As David Wallace-Wells writes (in a book that Franzen cites in his essay, but perhaps did not read very closely):\n\n[G]lobal warming is not binary. It is not a matter of \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d not a question of \u201cfucked\u201d or \u201cnot.\u201d Instead, it is a problem that gets worse over time the longer we produce greenhouse gas, and can be made better if we choose to stop. Which means that no matter how hot it gets, no matter how fully climate change transforms the planet and the way we live on it, it will always be the case that the next decade could contain more warming, and more suffering, or less warming and less suffering. Just how much is up to us, and always will be.\n\nBut don\u2019t take my colleague\u2019s word for it \u2014 take co-author of the 2018 IPCC report Myles Allen\u2019s. \u201cBad stuff is already happening and every half a degree of warming matters,\u201d Allen recently wrote, \u201cbut the IPCC does not draw a \u2018planetary boundary\u2019 at 1.5\u00b0C beyond which lie climate dragons.\u201d\n\nGiven both the technical feasibility of keeping warming below two degrees (or even below 1.5) \u2014 and the immense human consequences of every incremental increase in global temperatures \u2014 there is a strong argument for politicians and activists to hold the line on conventional warming targets, no matter how politically dubious or scientifically arbitrary they may be. That said, there is a difference between refusing to acquiesce to political probability, and refusing to make contingency plans in light of it. Given what the available evidence tells us about the prospects of rapid decarbonization over the next decade, it would be grossly irresponsible to oppose investments in carbon capture and other \u201cnegative emissions\u201d technologies. We no longer have the luxury of forswearing such \u201cmoral hazards.\u201d Similarly, given the certainty of wrenching ecological disruptions, Franzen is on firm ground when he calls on his readers to make comprehensive preparations for a world of climate chaos:\n\nPreparing for fires and floods and refugees is a directly pertinent example. But the impending catastrophe heightens the urgency of almost any world-improving action. In times of increasing chaos, people seek protection in tribalism and armed force, rather than in the rule of law, and our best defense against this kind of dystopia is to maintain functioning democracies, functioning legal systems, functioning communities. In this respect, any movement toward a more just and civil society can now be considered a meaningful climate action. Securing fair elections is a climate action. Combatting extreme wealth inequality is a climate action. Shutting down the hate machines on social media is a climate action. Instituting humane immigration policy, advocating for racial and gender equality, promoting respect for laws and their enforcement, supporting a free and independent press, ridding the country of assault weapons \u2014 these are all meaningful climate actions. To survive rising temperatures, every system, whether of the natural world or of the human world, will need to be as strong and healthy as we can make it.\n\nAnd yet, virtually every climate group that\u2019s currently agitating for rapid decarbonization also supports investments in adaptation and resilience. Meanwhile, Franzen\u2019s suggestion that supporters of a Green New Deal believe climate must be \u201ceveryone\u2019s overriding priority\u201d \u2014 such that no one is allowed to focus on combating wealth or racial inequality \u2014 would be news to both Ocasio-Cortez and her critics.\n\nSome men just want to watch the world bird.\n\nFranzen and climate activists do not disagree on the importance of fair elections and humane immigration policy. The author builds up the straw man of a green movement that disdains Black Lives Matter (for failing to focus on the one true crisis) to build a broader coalition behind his true, idiosyncratic complaint: that \u201crenewable energy projects\u201d are defacing his favorite bird preserves:\n\nEvery renewable-energy mega-project that destroys a living ecosystem \u2014 the \u201cgreen\u201d energy development now occurring in Kenya\u2019s national parks, the giant hydroelectric projects in Brazil, the construction of solar farms in open spaces, rather than in settled areas \u2014 erodes the resilience of a natural world already fighting for its life. Soil and water depletion, overuse of pesticides, the devastation of world fisheries \u2014 collective will is needed for these problems, too, and, unlike the problem of carbon, they\u2019re within our power to solve.\n\nFranzen articulated this grievance more clearly in his previous, widely panned New Yorker essay on climate change, in which he voiced frustration at the Audubon Society\u2019s misguided obsession with climate, and the ostensible willingness of some so-called environmentalists to \u201cblight every landscape with biofuel agriculture, solar farms, and wind turbines.\u201d At bottom, his new piece is just an elaborately elliptical rendering of the same objection. Like President Trump, Franzen has a visceral distaste for wind turbines and is willing to distort climate science to rationalize his opposition to massive investments in renewable energy.\n\nIn reality, stipulating that it is too late to avoid two degrees Celsius warming actually strengthens the case for prioritizing \u201crenewable-energy mega-projects\u201d over conservation; since there is no \u201cpoint of no return\u201d on climate (or at least, none that we can know in advance), the bleaker one\u2019s assessment of the prospects for rapid decarbonization, the more committed one should be to reducing emissions by all practical means.\n\nWe don\u2019t have 12 years to save the world. But we do have the rest of our lives to save as many of each other as we can.
