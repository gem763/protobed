Stand with Hong Kong\u201d as a form of civil disobedience after the NBA walked back a pro-Hong Kong statement to not upset China, which is a large portion of its market share.\n\n\u201cChina is trying to censor the Houston Rockets (update: and now the entire NBA) because of Hong Kong. Wouldn\u2019t it be hilarious if on opening night in Staples Center the NBA fanbase made a collective demonstration against censorship by wearing \u201cSTAND WITH Hong Kong\u201d T-Shirts?\u201d the GoFundMe page says, which blew threw its $20,000 goal within a week.\n\nThe shirt\u2019s phrase comes from Houston Rockets owner Daryl Morey, who sparked an international conflict between China and the NBA in early October after tweeting support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nMr. Morey deleted and apologized for the tweet, but it led China\u2019s state broadcaster to cancel the broadcasts of preseason games in the country and NBA stores to pull Rockets\u2019 merchandise from their shelves.\n\nThe NBA originally said the tweet was \u201cregrettable,\u201d but NBA Commissioner Adam Silver supported Mr. Morey and his right to freedom of speech.\n\nMr. Lared said on Reddit they would hand out the shirts for free during the Oct. 22 Lakers opening when they play the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe campaign comes after the Lakers\u2018 star player, LeBron James, criticized Mr. Morey\u2019s comments on China for not being \u201ceducated.\u201d\n\nHis comments were met immediately with backlash on social media from critics who accused him of kowtowing to China and led protesters in Hong Kong to burn his jerseys.\n\n\u2022 Valerie Richardson contributed to this article.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
