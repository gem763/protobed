Each of the two panels in the diptych had four scenes.\n\nOnly two other elements of the diptych are known to exist: \"The Flagellation of Christ\" displayed at the Frick in New York, and \"The Virgin and Child with Two Angels\" at the National Gallery in London.\n\nCimabue is renowned for his mosaics, frescoes and altarpieces.\n\nHistorians say only about a dozen works on wood -- all unsigned -- are thought to have been made by the Italian artist.\n\nHis more natural and nuanced depictions marked a turning point for Italian painters still influenced by highly stylised Byzantine art.\n\nArt historians consider him a trailblazer for the creative Renaissance that would flourish under greats like Giotto, one of Cimabue's pupils.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Life & Culture - [SENLIS, FRANCE] A rare masterpiece by Italian early Renaissance master Cimabue that was discovered in a French kitchen was sold on Sunday for 24 million euros (S$36.3 million), about five times the initial estimate. .
