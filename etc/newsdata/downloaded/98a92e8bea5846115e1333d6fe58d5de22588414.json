Reacting to the card, veteran film actor Soni Razdan and Alia Bhatt's mother called it a \u2018non-issue\u2019.\n\nSoni Razdan spoke to Times Of India and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a non-issue. Please, don\u2019t give these miscreants more publicity than they deserve.\u201d\n\nThe card that went viral on the internet had details of sagan ceremony of Alia with her boyfriend and actor Ranbir Kapoor on January 22, 2020.\n\nBut there were evident mistakes on the card, like Alia\u2019s name was mispelled as \u2018Aliya\u2019 and mentioned her father\u2019s name as \u2018Mukesh Bhatt\u2019. Mukesh, who is Mahesh\u2019s brother and Alia\u2019s uncle also reacted on the viral wedding card. He said,\n\nDon't Miss 491 SHARES 154 SHARES 40.7 K SHARES 8.3 K SHARES\n\n\u201cAlia is busy shooting for Sadak 2 in Ooty. I have got a call from all over the country inquiring about the same. How can it be real? It\u2019s sad. There are so many mistakes on the card.\u201d\n\nEven Alia, who was spotted at the airport laughed off the wedding rumors and the news of viral card. Just a few days ago, Razdan had also rubbished the reports as saying,\n\n\u201cLook, it is sweet of all their fans to ask everything about them. I am Alia\u2019s mother. I really do not want to talk about my daughter\u2019s personal life. I want her to be happy. And she has my love and blessing on everything she does, beyond that I want her to live her life the way she wants to. As a mother, I do not give her any \u2018gyaan\u2019 because my Alia is very sensible as an individual.\"\n\nRanbir Kapoor, who has always stayed low-key on his private life is yet to make any comment on the 'rumored' wedding.", "description": "A viral image of Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's rumored wedding in Udaipur was doing rounds on the internet.
