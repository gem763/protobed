REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump may not care about most kinds of soft power, but the U.S. president likes to win. In the latest annual index of countries\u2019 persuasiveness America is a loser: down to fifth from top of the rankings three years ago, and pipped for fourth place by Sweden. One-sided military might and economic heft only go so far.\n\nA country\u2019s allure and perceived trustworthiness on the world stage matter to its selfish interests, even if the effect isn\u2019t direct. That\u2019s why even Trump, who promised to \u201cmake America great again\u201d and takes the \u201cAmerica first\u201d slogan to heart, shouldn\u2019t ignore the obvious deterioration of his country\u2019s reputation.\n\nIn essence, the image of Washington\u2019s government is so poor \u2013 including among Americans \u2013 that it increasingly outweighs undoubted U.S. strengths in other spheres. That\u2019s what drives the slide in its ranking in the Soft Power 30, a joint project by communications consultancy Portland and the University of Southern California\u2019s Center on Public Diplomacy.\n\nAs the new Soft Power 30 report notes, Trump\u2019s zero-sum worldview is part of the problem. A liking for tariffs on trade, a hard economic power play, reflects the idea that there\u2019s no mutual benefit to be had from compromise, accommodation or cooperation. The same MAGA mindset is on view in the president\u2019s affirmation this week that the United States would formally quit the 2015 Paris accord on climate change \u2013 and in his attitude to the U.S. military, which remains the world\u2019s strongest and by far the most expensive, a tool for projecting both hard and softer power depending how it is used.\n\nPresidents last at most eight years, and there are forces that outlive them. In the case of American soft power, these include the technology industry, led by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and others. On top of that come many of the world\u2019s top universities, including Harvard, Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and cultural phenomena like artist Taylor Swift.\n\nAmerica\u2019s personal freedoms and legal system also remain the envy of many in the world. The factors that helped France under President Emmanuel Macron regain the top position or kept the UK and Germany in the top five may not last. U.S. soft power, however, could use some polishing.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump may not care about most kinds of soft power, but the U.S. president likes to win.
