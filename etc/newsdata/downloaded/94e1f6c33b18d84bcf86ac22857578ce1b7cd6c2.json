This appears to put on a path for its best year since 2010, when it gained just under 30 percent.\n\nI believe buying the dips in right now could turn out to be a wise investment decision. I see a lot happening at the moment\u2014from an unprecedented $17 trillion in negative-yielding bonds worldwide to heightened geopolitical threats\u2014that might boost investors\u2019 appetite for the metal, which has a history of holding its value in times of crisis.\n\nRead on for three reasons why I believe there\u2019s further upside to prices, and how you can participate!\n\n1. U.S. inflation is finally starting to heat up.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, many market watchers expected consumer prices to climb rather quickly due to his protectionist policies and general skepticism of free trade agreements. Except for a blip here and there, inflation has remained pretty steady, even after hefty tariffs were imposed on goods imported from China.\n\nThat may be set to change, though, if the August inflation reading is any indication. \u201cCore\u201d consumer prices\u2014which exclude volatile food and energy prices\u2014rose to an 11-year high of 2.4 percent growth year-on-year. Not since September 2008 have prices expanded so fast.\n\nAlso of note: August saw the biggest monthly rise in medical care costs since 2016 as well as record increases in health insurance prices.\n\nAnd remember, this doesn\u2019t include the effects of the 15 tariffs on $112 billion in Chinese goods that the U.S. imposed on September 1.\n\nIn the past, faster inflation has been constructive for prices. That\u2019s because inflation, by its nature, destroys your purchasing power, and to limit these losses, investors have traditionally turned to the yellow metal as well as gold mining stocks.\n\nSo if you believe inflation is prepared to surge even more, it might make sense to add to your portfolio.\n\n2. Negative yields in the U.S.?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, as much as $17 trillion in debt around the world right now trades at a negative yield. This has recently pushed the price of to new all-time highs in a number of currencies, including the British pound, Japanese yen and Canadian and Australian dollars.\n\nSo far we haven\u2019t seen the negative-yield phenomenon in the U.S., at least not nominally. But it could only be a matter of time before U.S. fixed-income yields turn subzero\u2014especially if Trump gets his way.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been under immense pressure to drop rates to a level that, in Trump\u2019s eyes, is more competitive with those in Europe, Japan and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt,\u201d Trump tweeted on September 11. \u201cThe USA should always be paying the lowest rate.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m writing this a day before the Fed is widely expected to trim rates for the second time this year, and many analysts now believe as many as two more cuts could happen in 2019. Should U.S. rates drop to \u201cZERO, or less,\u201d to quote Trump, then I believe Treasury bonds and investment-grade corporate debt would lose their appeal as stores of value, and would be a direct beneficiary.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re doubtful that negative yields could possibly occur in the U.S., consider the recent words of one Alan Greenspan, former Fed chairman: \u201cThere is no barrier for U.S. Treasury yields going below zero. Zero has no meaning, besides being a certain level.\u201d\n\nIf you believe U.S. yields could soon break below this \u201cbarrier,\u201d then might be a prudent investment decision.\n\n3. Geopolitical and economic risks raise the demand for a safe haven.\n\nThere are a number of geopolitical and economic risks right now that have triggered gold\u2019s \u201cfear trade.\u201d Economic growth is slowing worldwide as a result of trade tensions. Global factories, as measured by the JPMorgan (NYSE: ) Global Manufacturing PMI, have been in contraction mode for two straight months as of August.\n\nInvestors in the U.K. and elsewhere have turned to as the October 31 deadline for Brexit looms ever closer. With it looking more and more likely that the U.K. will leave the European Union (EU) without a deal, the price of gold in pound sterlings rose to an all-time high of 1,282 on September 3, an increase of more than 27 percent for the year.\n\nOther geopolitical concerns, including unrest in Hong Kong as well as last Saturday\u2019s attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, have helped support demand.\n\nSuch concerns also help explain why global central banks have been net buyers of the yellow metal since 2010. The Netherlands\u2019 central bank (DNB) recently explained why it continues to hold :\n\n\u201cShares, bonds and other securities are not without risk, and prices can go down\u2026 If the system collapses, the stocks can help serve as a basis to build it up again. Gold historically bolsters confidence in the stability of the central bank\u2019s balance sheet and creates a sense of security.\u201d \u2013 Frank Holmes", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Commodity Trade Mantra  covering: XAU/USD, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Gold Futures.
