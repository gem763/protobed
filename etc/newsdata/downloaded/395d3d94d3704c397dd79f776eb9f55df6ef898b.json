We are playing also for a lot of things,\" said the coach.\n\nSouth Africa is a country where \"things don't always run fluidly\", noted Erasmus.\n\n\"We know when we play, we represent much more than just those 23 playing on the field.\"\n\nScrumhalf Faf de Klerk said the team was looking forward to what he expected to be an \"amazing\" atmosphere at the Tokyo Stadium on Sunday but stressed that the Springboks would put that out of their minds on the pitch.\n\n\"Obviously we have got a lot of respect for Japanese people but I think once you step on that field, it's every team for itself,\" said de Klerk.\n\n\"It's just rugby and it's going to be physical,\" said the scrumhalf.\n\nErasmus said he was preparing his team for a \"passionate\" reception on Sunday but did not expect fans to be hostile - which he respected.\n\n\"I have complimented them a lot this week for no other reason but to be sincere,\" said Erasmus.\n\n\"While saying that, we're playing for our country and we want to try to win the World Cup. For the next week, unfortunately Japan is the enemy for one week.\n\n\"We love the country, we love the people but we have to try to beat them.\"\n\nKick-off is at 12:15 (SA time) on Sunday.\n\nTeams:\n\nJapan\n\n15 Ryohei Yamanaka, 14 Kotaro Matsushima, 13 Timothy Lafaele, 12 Ryoto Nakamura, 11 Kenki Fukuoka, 10 Yu Tamura, 9 Yutaka Nagare, 8 Kazuki Himeno, 7 Lappies Labuschagne, 6 Michael Leitch (captain), 5 James Moore, 4 Luke Thompson, 3 Koo Ji-won, 2 Shota Horie, 1 Keita Inagaki\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Atsushi Sakate, 17 Isileli Nakajima, 18 Asaeli Ai Valu, 19 Wimpie van der Walt, 20 Amanaki Lelei Mafi, 21 Fumiaki Tanaka, 22 Rikiya Matsuda, 23 Lomano Lava Lemeki\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 Cheslin Kolbe, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn", "description": "The Boks will have to shelve their affection for Japan and Japanese fans to spoil the hosts' party in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2860/24b680fcefaa4bc3849631ffc540624a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
