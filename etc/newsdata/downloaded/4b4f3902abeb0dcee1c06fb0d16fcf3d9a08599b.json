In a letter to the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, Bakaj points directly at Trump\u2019s aggressive statements that he said prompted \u201cconcerns for our client\u2019s safety\u201d.\n\nThe letter, first reported by 60 Minutes on CBS News, quotes Trump\u2019s comments on Thursday to staff at the US mission to the UN in New York. In his remarks, made behind closed doors but reported by the New York Times, the US president made a thinly-veiled threat that showed disdain for the institutional protections afforded to whistleblowers under federal law.\n\nRudy Giuliani: Biden aides say TV news must stop booking Trump lawyer Read more\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nBakaj said that the indirect nature of Trump\u2019s comment in referring to the person who fed the whistleblower the information \u201cdoes nothing to assuage our concerns for our client\u2019s safety\u201d. The lawyer added that individuals were also offering $50,000 rewards for information that would out the intelligence official.\n\nIn an accompanying letter to senior Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate, Bakaj made an impassioned plea to the political leadership of both parties to \u201cspeak out in favor of whistleblower protection\u201d. He asked them to make clear that \u201cthis is a protected system where retaliation is not permitted, whether direct or implied. We further expect that political leaders from both parties condemn any intimidation against our client and others.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower is reviled by the White House for having filed a complaint on 12 August that exposed the president\u2019s efforts to engage the Ukraine government in digging up dirt on Joe Biden, the former vice president who is a frontrunner to challenge Trump in next year\u2019s presidential election. Trump has responded by belittling the whistleblower, questioning his patriotism and trying to breach his anonymity.\n\nGraham prepares Trump defence as impeachment fury intensifies Read more\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump returned to the subject on Twitter. \u201cI deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019, represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nTrump was referring to the whistleblower\u2019s account of the 25 July conversation between the US president and his opposite number in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A reconstructed transcript of the phone call shows that the whistleblower\u2019s account was entirely accurate.\n\nTrump was also criticised on Sunday night by a member of his own party for quoting on Twitter a comment from Pastor Robert Jeffress on Fox News, who said: \u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d\n\nRepublican congressman Adam Kinzinger said the quote was \u201crepugnant\u201d.\n\nEven before the latest presidential threats, lawyers working with whistleblowers had warned that Trump\u2019s belligerent language would send a chill through the intelligence services and dissuade other officials troubled about misconduct from coming forward in future.\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee who is spearheading the impeachment inquiry, hopes to call the whistleblower to testify as part of the proceedings in a secure and private setting. On Sunday night another of the whistleblower\u2019s legal team, Mark Zaid, said that discussions were ongoing over a possible Congressional meeting \u201cbut no date/time has yet been set\u201d.", "description": "Whistleblower\u2019s attorney says president\u2019s demands to identify their client has prompted safety concerns", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61755ffc1366344f6b820fa9184fafe7ec4811a1/0_28_2606_1563/master/2606.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7159732d70deda145aa905588e4b93f5", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
