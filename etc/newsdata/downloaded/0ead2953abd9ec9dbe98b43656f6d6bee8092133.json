REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko -/File Photo\n\nThe potential closures, which Jan Oberholzer said could cut a tenth of the state firm\u2019s 45,000 MW production capacity, piles pressure on the government which has had to bail out the debt-ridden company to keep it afloat.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest public utility supplies over 90% of South Africa\u2019s electricity, relying largely on ageing, heavily polluting coal-fired power stations but does not generate enough cash to meet its debt servicing costs.\n\nIt is also responsible for at least a third of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nInstalling the technology needed to reduce carbon and sulphur emissions would cost 10 times the 26 billion rand the Treasury has earmarked for Eskom in the financial year ending in March 2020, part of a 59-billion-rand two-year package.\n\nThat package is on top of a 23 billion rand a year bailout for the next three years.\n\n\u201cIf we were to press a button today and solve all theses (emissions) troubles, it would cost us 300 billion rand ($20 billion). But as you know we do not have money,\u201d Eskom\u2019s acting Chief Executive and chairman Jabu Mabuza told reporters.\n\nEskom has therefore applied to the Department of Environmental Affairs for rolling postponements of its obligations to meet the emissions and air standards.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t fix this and reduce our emissions, there\u2019s a risk that we have to shut down some of the power stations,\u201d Oberholzer told a press briefing. \u201cHave we done the work we said we would? No we haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOberholzer did not say when Eskom\u2019s failure to meet emissions requirements might trigger plant closures.\n\nKEEPING THE LIGHTS ON\n\nRatings agencies regularly cite Eskom as one of the biggest threats to South Africa\u2019s investment-grade credit rating status.\n\nPower cuts - referred to as loadshedding in South Africa - in the first quarter pushed Africa\u2019s most developed economy into a deep contraction.\n\nThough the situation has improved since March due to stable coal supplies and a maintenance overhaul, Mabuza did not rule out further blackouts.\n\n\u201cWhilst we cannot guarantee there will be no loadshedding we are confident we can keep the lights on this summer,\u201d he said.\n\nEskom\u2019s coal stocks were at 50 days, excluding the Medupi and Kusile power stations, Mabuza said, adding that the company planned to undertake plant maintenance on 5,500 MW of capacity over the next seven months.\n\nCoal stocks were at half of required regulatory levels of 50 days or more at the beginning of the year at most power stations.\n\nMedupi and Kusile, currently under construction and not yet fully operational, are among the largest coal stations in the world but since building started in 2008, both have suffered major breakdowns while costs have escalated.\n\nThese setbacks have compounded South Africa\u2019s power shortages and worsened Eskom\u2019s financial crisis.\n\nCosts to complete construction of Medupi and Kusile have ballooned to 145 billion rand and 161 billion, respectively, according to Eskom\u2019s worst-case forecasts on Wednesday.\n\nMeeting emission standards for Medupi alone could add another 80 billion rand to costs.\n\n($1 = 15.2369 rand)", "description": "South Africa's cash-strapped power utility Eskom could be forced to shut some plants if it fails to reduce emissions, its chief operating officer warned on Wednesday, raising the spectre of further blackouts.", "authors": ["Mfuneko Toyana", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426078438&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830PS-OZABS"}
