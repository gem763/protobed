Glassdoor, an online job and recruiting site, has revealed its 2019 list of the most lucrative jobs. The findings are based on salary reviews posted by employees on its site between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019.\n\nHealth care and tech industries are the go-to fields with the highest paying salaries, according to Glassdoor. Jobs in the medical field took the top 4 spots, with physician commanding the highest median entry-level salary \u2014 $193,415 a year. That\u2019s more than three-and-a-half times the median U.S. base salary of $53,950 a year. Pharmacy manager ($144,768), dentist ($142,478), and pharmacist ($126,438) take spots 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\n\nOne thing that the top four health care jobs have in common is that they require a significant amount of specialized education and have pretty substantial barriers to entry. \"Health care accounts for the four highest-paying roles, which demonstrates that these high paying jobs are tied to in-demand skills, but also higher education as well. So all of the health care roles require advanced degrees in order to be qualified,\" said Amanda Stansell, Glassdoor senior economic research analyst.\n\nGraphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nDespite health care\u2019s top billing on the list, tech is the true dominant force. In 2019, tech jobs notched 14 of the top 25 spots, with the highest paying job in the industry being enterprise architect. It has a median base salary of $122,585.\n\nThe fight for tech talent continues to drive competitive salaries, Stansell said. The industry is so hot right now, that once-traditional roles, such as software engineering manager or data scientist, are springing up across other industries.\n\n\u201cNot only are tech employers fighting for these individuals, companies in other industries like retail and health care, are also trying to hire these highly-skilled workers. The competition is pretty fierce,\u201d Stansell said.\n\nData scientist came in 22nd on the list, with a median salary of $97,027, but it has other upsides as well, said Stansell. \u201cData scientists come up on our highest paying jobs lists, as well as some of our other lists like best jobs. Not only are data scientists really well paid, they\u2019re also satisfied and pretty happy with their jobs as well,\u201d she said. And if there weren\u2019t already enough reasons for data scientist to love their jobs, it is also a position that some say is recession-proof.\n\nclose up of man hand analyzing stock market chart More\n\nStaying power\n\nGoing forward, Glassdoor predicts jobs like data scientist, data architect, and analytics manager will continue to pay top dollar. The main reason is that the number of people with these niche skills is low, while demand for them is high.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that tech companies companies will also offer appealing compensation packages that make employees want to stay. These companies tend to hire both tech and non-tech roles, so anyone looking for a new job might consider stepping into the tech industry.\u201d", "description": "Glassdoor, an online job and recruiting site, has revealed its 2019 list of the highest paying jobs.", "authors": ["Reggie Wade"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xov8A8eFYNQFpijf5rcziQ--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/38d70650-8155-11e9-baf9-fa894712d741", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
