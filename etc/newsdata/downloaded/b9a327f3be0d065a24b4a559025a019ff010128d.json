Epstein reportedly posed as a talent scout for Victoria's Secret to lure young women, according to the New York Times. He also obtained two mansions and a private plane \u2014 valued at about $100 million today \u2014 that were previously owned by Wexner or his companies, the newspaper said.\n\n\"Everyone has to feel enormous regret for the advantage that was taken of so many young women,\" Wexner told analysts at an investor update meeting this week. \"That's just unexplainable, abhorrent behavior, and clearly is something we all would condemn.\"\n\n\"At some point in your life we are all betrayed by friends,\" Wexner continued, adding that \"people have secret lives\" and hide them so well they can have relationships without revealing their \"peculiar\" behavior. \"Being taken advantage of by someone who was so sick, so cunning, so deprived is something that I'm embarrassed that I was even close to.\"\n\nL Brands didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Markets Insider.\n\nEpstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking of minors in July. He pleaded not guilty to paying dozens of underage girls to engage in sex acts. He was found dead in his jail cell in August.\n\nWexner denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes in a memo to employees in July. \"I would never have guessed that a person I employed more than a decade ago could have caused such pain to so many people,\" he said, according to the Wall Street Journal. \"I have searched my soul \u2026 reflected \u2026 and regretted that my path ever crossed his.\"\n\nEpstein \"misappropriated vast sums of money\" while serving as Wexner's adviser, the executive wrote in a letter to his foundation in August.\n\nWexner has an incentive to distance himself and his company from Epstein: L Brands stock has dropped by more than a quarter since the New York Times expos\u00e9. The scandal has ramped up pressure on Victoria's Secret to revamp its hypersexualized brand image and overhaul its annual fashion show, especially after three consecutive years of sales declines.\n\nRead more: Jeffrey Epstein was the sole director of private-equity guru Leon Black's family foundation for more than a decade.
