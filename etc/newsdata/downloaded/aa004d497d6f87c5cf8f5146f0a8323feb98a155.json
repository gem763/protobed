They echo a shift in tone from other ministers towards stressing the importance of securing a deal.\n\nApparently designed to quash widespread suspicions that the prime minister privately favours no-deal, the remarks may be part of an effort to put pressure on Mr Johnson to make good on his public declarations that he wants an agreement with Brussels to allow an orderly Brexit.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But the UK as a whole must remain sovereign and it is important that decisions are done on that basis.\"\n\nAsked if alternative arrangements for the border could be implemented in time for the end-of-October deadline, he replied: \"Operationally these issues do not apply until the end of the implementation period, which is December 2020 - or one or two years later by mutual agreement.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s government is \u201cfully committed\u201d to securing a withdrawal agreement with Brussels by 31 October, the home secretary Priti Patel has said.
