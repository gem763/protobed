We welcome investment in the United States.\"\n\nStill, the Chinese propaganda arm criticized the move by the U.S. politicians, saying that they \"seem to believe that a decoupling from China will be simple\" and \"won't significantly impact its economy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, China's top trade negotiator is said to be leading the country's delegation to the U.S. for the next round of discussions one week after China's National Holiday, Commerce Ministry Vice Minister Wang Shouwen said Sunday.\n\n\"We look forward to the 13th round of negotiations,\" Wang said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation. \"We hope both sides, on the basis of equal and mutual respect, jointly take care of each other's concerns and, with a calm attitude, use negotiations to resolve differences, and find a resolution that's beneficial to both sides.\"\n\nThe U.S. and China have been locked in a protracted trade war for more than a year, with each country slapping tariffs on goods worth billions of dollars.\n\nChinese tech giants listed in the U.S. immediately reacted. Alibaba shares slipped more than 5% on the reports, while Baidu and JD.com also fell 3.6% and 6% respectively on Friday after the news came out.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.", "description": "The state-owned outlet criticized the move by the U.S. politicians, saying that they \"seem to believe that a decoupling from China will be simple\" and \"won't significantly impact its economy.\"", "authors": ["Grace Shao"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106096088-1566778497612gettyimages-1058471374.jpeg?v=1569808353", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
