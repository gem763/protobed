REUTERS/Alwyn Scott\n\nThe three Dogger Bank wind projects in the North Sea will use GE\u2019s Haliade-X turbine, which with a capacity of 12 megawatts (MW) is the world\u2019s most powerful turbine.\n\n\u201cDogger Bank will now be home to the largest offshore wind turbines in the world and this pioneering low carbon technology, which will play a central role in helping the UK become carbon neutral by 2050,\u201d Paul Cooley, director of capital projects at SSE Renewables, said in a statement.\n\nGE Renewable Energy is a Paris-based division of General Electric (GE.N).\n\nOrsted (ORSTED.CO) is also set to use the Haliade-X for two U.S. projects, with the first off the Maryland coast expected to begin operation in 2022.\n\nThe spokesman said the turbines for Dogger Bank are likely to be built in GE\u2019s factories in Saint Nazaire and Cherbourg in France.\n\nSSE and Equnor won contracts for the three Dogger Bank projects under Britain\u2019s latest renewable subsidy auction, which cleared at a record low for offshore wind last month.\n\nThe cost of developing offshore wind projects has plummeted over the last few years, largely due to the increase in the size of turbines.\n\nThe most powerful turbine currently in commercial operation is Vestas\u2019 (VWS.CO) 9.5 MW turbine.\n\nBritain is already the world\u2019s largest offshore wind market, and plans to generate a third of its electricity from the technology by 2030 in a bid to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.", "description": "GE Renewable Energy has been chosen as preferred supplier to provide turbines for Britain's Dogger Bank offshore wind project being developed by SSE and Equinor , the companies said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435842574&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902IN", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
