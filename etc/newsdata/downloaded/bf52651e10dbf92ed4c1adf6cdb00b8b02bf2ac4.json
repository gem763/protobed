She did not go to college that morning.'\n\nInstead, Jessie stayed at home and watched TV but her mother said that she seemed fine.\n\nIn the evening, she was pottering around her room while Heather went out with a friend.\n\nWhen Heather returned later in the evening Jessie's stepdad Simon said the teenager was still up in the room.\n\nHeather went up to give her some chocolates to cheer her up and found her hanging outside her room.\n\nChildLine sent a transcript of the conversation to a police officer which was then forwarded to a mental health worker whom Jessie had been seeing\n\nHer mother and stepfather tried desperately to save the girl with CPR but were unsuccessful.\n\nParamedics also attempted to revive her when they arrived on the scene but she never regained consciousness.\n\nJessie died later that same evening on January 23 earlier this year.\n\nThe inquest heard that Jessie had passed all her GCSEs but had a history of self-harming and became stressed while studying for A Levels at Scarborough Sixth Form College.\n\nHeather told the hearing that no one had told her that Jessie was a suicide risk and said that the 'beautiful soul' had been a casualty of a 'catalogue of errors' by those supposed to be supporting her.\n\nCoroner Jonathan Heath recorded a narrative verdict that Jessie (pictured) had been found dead by her mother after leaving suicide notes\n\nCoroner Jonathan Heath recorded a narrative verdict that Jessie had been found dead by her mum after leaving suicide notes.\n\nBut he did not make any recommendations after hearing that the mental health organisations involved had learned lessons from the tragedy.\n\nChildLine, who had only spoken to the police about their concerns for Jessie, agreed that the agencies needed to work closer together in the future.\n\nThe charity organisation, originally inspired by an idea by That's Life presenter Esther Rantzen, has been run by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children since 2005.\n\nAn NSPCC spokesman said: 'This is terribly sad and our thoughts are with Jessie's family.
