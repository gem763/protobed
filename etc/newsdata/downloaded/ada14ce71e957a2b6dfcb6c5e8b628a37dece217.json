We put him to bed with paracetamol and ibuprofen.\n\n\"The next day he was really poorly, very hot, struggled breathing, so we called an ambulance and within a few minutes he had been rushed to hospital.\n\n\"A few minutes more in A&E and he was taken theatre and put to sleep and he was taken to intensive care.\n\n(Image: Public Health England)\n\n\"It was really scary. They couldn't look after him in our hospital so they transferred him to Bristol paediatric intensive care unit, where he was on a ventilator for three days.\n\n\"But he was really lucky and did recover really well, enough to come back to our local hospital where he stayed for another two weeks.\n\n\"We had lots of physiotherapy, getting him to breathe again. He couldn't stand up, he couldn't walk.\n\n\"He'd gone in a few days from being a fit, healthy eight-year-old boy to not being able to walk down the corridor, it was really sad.\"\n\nAll primary school children are now elligible for a free flu vaccination, and Public Health England wants to increase the rate of youngsters being given the nasal spray.\n\nParents will be asked to complete a consent form allowing their child to be vaccinated.\n\nAround 60 percent of school aged children in the South Wet took up the vaccine last year.\n\nDr Julie Yates, head of screening and immunisation at Public Health England South West, said: \"We are so pleased that Year 6 children are now eligible for the flu vaccine which means that all children in primary school can now have this vaccination at school.\n\n\"Flu is a really nasty bug and it is not like having a cold. It can have serious complications and can be life threatening.\n\n\"At the very least it can knock you off your feet for days.\n\n\"This means absence from school for children and time off work for parents, not to mention the possibility of spreading the bug in families especially in the older more vulnerable community.\"", "description": "Mum Janine Ridley, from Bristol, has released pictures of son Henry to warn other families", "authors": ["Briana Millett", "John Bett", "Image", "Public Health England"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546601.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Henry-Riley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
