I was talking to someone who said we\u2019ll see how hard the border is if bombs start going off in Limerick.\u201d\n\nUnited Kingdom, Republic of Ireland Leaders in Last-Minute Meet to Discuss Brexit Deal https://t.co/g87NH4W9CZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 10, 2019\n\nHe went on to say: \u201cThis is not empty rhetoric. When a loyalist says \u2018over my dead body\u2019, they mean it. The dog is in the trap and we are waiting to see when the hare will be released.\u201d\n\nAt issue are the rumoured customs and regulatory checks on the Irish Sea in Boris Johnson\u2019s latest attempt at striking a deal with the European Union.

The Democratic Unionist Party [DUP] are not the only people Boris should be consulting.\u201d", "description": "Loyalists in Northern Ireland have threatened action if Boris Johnson\u2019s deal devalues the status of Northern Ireland", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Loyalist-paramilitaries-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
