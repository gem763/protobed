Tuesday was the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China \u2013 the occasion for a spectacular, 100,000-person parade in Beijing. Hong Kong was forced to cancel the annual fireworks to prevent embarrassment by pro-democracy protesters.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was in Beijing on Tuesday as police shot Tsang.\n\nHong Kong police insist that the office who used live fire to tear into Tsang\u2019s chest was in danger from \u201crioters'\u201d attacks and had to defend his life and those of his peers. Police referred to Tsang as an \u201cattacker\u201d despite the lack of evidence that he was wielding a weapon or antagonizing police.\n\nThe Hong Kong protest movement erupted in June against a proposed bill to allow China to extradite anyone out of Hong Kong and disppear them into the Communist Party\u2019s notorious torture prisons. Lam conceded the withdrawal of the extradition bill, but Hong Kong residents are still demanding the right to elect all of their lawmakers, freedom for political prisoners, an investigation into police brutality, and an end to officials referring to peaceful protesters as \u201crioters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe life of the officer at the scene was under serious threat and he was forced to shoot at the assailant to protect his own life as well as his colleagues,\u201d Xinhua claimed regarding the incident with Tsang, the first time that Hong Kong police have fired live bullets at protesters since the protests began this year.\n\nThe South China Morning Post noted on Wednesday that the editorial in Xinhua\u2019s pages claimed that the unarmed protesters, or \u201crioters,\u201d \u201cattacked police officers on a great scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018black terror\u2019 that has lasted for more than three months is close to craziness,\u201d Xinhua claimed. \u201cTo stop the violence and curb disorder, we must make prominent the power of the rule of law, cut out the tumor of violence and prosecute all rioters in accordance with the law as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201c[His] action was totally legal, legitimate and appropriate,\u201d it said.\n\nXinhua reportedly concluded by calling the Hong Kong protesters \u201cterrorists,\u201d though it did not provide examples of any terrorist acts.\n\nHong Kong police had shot live bullets during protests on two prior occasions this year, but only in the capacity of \u201cwarning shots\u201d to disperse protesters. Tuesday\u2019s was the first shooting directly targeting unarmed protesters. Tsang, whose name and age was confirmed on Wednesday, was recorded taken out of the protest scene and to the hospital in a conscious state, but authorities declared him in critical condition shortly thereafter. Medical staff treating the student said that he had returned to \u201cstable condition\u201d after surgery to remove the bullet and repair damage. The bullet reportedly missed his heart by three centimeters and lodged itself in his chest.\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese regime propaganda outlet, repeatedly claimed Tsang was shot \u201cnear the shoulder.\u201d\n\nHong Kong Police Commissioner Stephen Lo offered the full force of the department\u2019s support to the officer who shot Tsang.\n\n\u201cMy colleague was under a close-range attack. He made a decision in a split-second because he felt his life and his colleague\u2019s were being threatened,\u201d Lo said. \u201cWe believe [the action] was reasonable and legal.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times, citing Lo, claimed that Tsang had \u201cassaulted the police officer next to him with a baton.\u201d The newspaper went on to claim the \u201crioters\u201d had \u201cattacked police officers in a very violent way, with iron stick, bricks and petrol bombs.\u201d\n\nPolice reportedly arrested 269 people on Tuesday for \u201cholding offensive weapons, assaulting police officers and taking part in riots,\u201d the Times claimed.\n\nThe Beijing-controlled Hong Kong government supported the police in their efforts to defend the shooting of a teenaged student, again referring to the peaceful anti-communist movement\u2019s assemblies as \u201criots.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe riots in various districts in Hong Kong on October 1 were planned and organized, leading Hong Kong to a chaotic and panic state. This reflects that the nature of the issue has already changed,\u201d a Hong Kong government spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMany people took part in the unauthorized meetings and processions which turned out to be very dangerous riots, setting fires inside MTR stations, throwing petrol bombs, vandalizing shops and public properties, blocking thoroughfares to cause serious obstruction to fire fighting and ambulance work, and damaging the premises of the Cheung Sha Wan and Tsuen Wan government offices,\u201d Xinhua quoted the spokesperson as saying.\n\nThe government went on to justify police brutality against protesters because acts like burning the communist flag of China \u201cchallenged the national sovereignty.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "China's state-run Xinhua \"news\" service described Hong Kong police shooting an unarmed teen as \"totally legal, legitimate, and appropriate.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hong-kong-shooter-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
