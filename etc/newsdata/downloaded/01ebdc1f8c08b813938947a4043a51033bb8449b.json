(Photo by Stacy Revere/BIG3 via Getty Images)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers might not need a third superstar. The team may already have one. Though DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL in August, the Lakers aren\u2019t ruling out his return this season, according to Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN.\n\nLakers coach Frank Vogel said the team isn\u2019t \u201cclosing the door\u201d on Cousins coming back this year. Given that the injury occurred in August, Cousins would likely need months to recover. In a scenario where Cousins returns for the playoffs \u2014 which begin in April \u2014 Cousins would be about eight months removed from the injury. That, of course, is assuming the Lakers are in the playoffs.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat seems like a much safer bet after the team went out and acquired Anthony Davis in a trade during the offseason. Davis and LeBron James have the team off to a 1-1 start to begin the season.\n\nThe 29-year-old Cousins signed with the Lakers in July, but suffered a torn ACL while working out in August. It was Cousins\u2019 third major injury in the past few seasons. Cousins played in just 30 games last year due to an Achilles injury.\n\nOnce he returned, Cousins was used in a limited role. He averaged just 25 minutes per game with the Warriors, putting up 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds, then injured his quadriceps in the playoffs.\n\nConsidering he\u2019s coming off another significant injury, it\u2019s unclear how much Cousins will be able to give the Lakers if he\u2019s able to return. Cousins has put up superstar numbers in the past, but hasn\u2019t been at 100 percent in a few years.\n\nIf the Lakers are willing to take that risk, Cousins could help them when it matters most. But if the team is worried about how much Cousins will be able to contribute, it might be in everyone\u2019s best interest to give him as much time as possible to get right.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nStory continues\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
