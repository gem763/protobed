There, they would become It Guys and strong-jawed TV stars and Calvin Klein models.\n\nThat magical phrase: \u201cplucked from obscurity.\u201d It\u2019s the Gen X version of gee-golly \u201950s nostalgia, a rose-colored gaze back at simpler, more glamorous times. Or, in this case, when people wore more flannel.\n\nBut that\u2019s not Scott Wolf\u2019s story, the actor who first rose to fame when he was cast as Bailey Salinger in the Fox primetime drama Party of Five in 1994. Wolf was 26 when the series premiered, 25 years ago this fall.\n\nYes, his poster soon joined the hallowed Hall of Fame on girls\u2019 bedroom walls alongside Luke Perry and Jason Priestley. Yes, it seemed like he was shot out of a cannon directly into the hearts\u2014and libidos\u2014of teen girls, moms, working women, gay men, and anybody with a pulse, really.\n\nBut with Party of Five essentially a high-brow antidote to Beverly Hills: 90210, appealing to adults and critics as much as it did to the cool teens smoking cigarettes in the alley, he and co-stars Neve Campbell, Matthew Fox, and Jennifer Love Hewitt saw the combination of hipness and respect propel them to a different level of TV celebrity.\n\nThat celebrity has carried Wolf through a 25-year career that could, in essence, be demarcated by three beloved teen dramas he had roles on: Party of Five, Everwood in the early 2000s, and, now, The CW\u2019s Nancy Drew series, on which he plays\u2014brace yourself, folks\u2014the dad.\n\nIt\u2019s a harsh truth that teen idols grow up, and Wolf turned 51 this year. He has his own \u201cparty of five,\u201d so to speak: the three kids he\u2019s raising with his wife, life coach Kelley Limp, in Park City, Utah.\n\nHe\u2019s also doing the thing former teen idols aren\u2019t supposed to get to do, or, at least, that we almost never let them do: play the part that excites them, that casts them in a different light, that possibly sets them up for a new phase of their career. For Wolf, that\u2019s starring against type in Inside Game, out Friday, as a womanizing, drug-dealing go-between man in the infamous NBA scandal involving a referee who tipped off bookies on games he officiated.\n\nWhen he walks into the speakeasy-like second-floor bar at New York\u2019s EDITION hotel, not so much fresh off a Comic-Con blitz in support of Nancy Drew as having survived it, he grins at the leather-and-maple decor. He\u2019s been sneaking night caps there over the last few days with his brother, who lives in New Jersey near where they grew up, just outside the city.\n\nHe\u2019s dressed like a dad: slacks, button-down, and a firm handshake. A hot dad, sure. But still. The jawline is practically showing off as he smiles and rolls up his sleeves, excited to dig into it. Two Old Fashioneds are dropped off at the table, and he lifts his to cheers.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time since that major start to his career that he\u2019s given an in-depth interview about what he\u2019s been through, where he\u2019s come from, and how he managed to weather two-and-a-half decades in Hollywood largely unscathed. What a nice thing, a rare thing, really, when you think about it: Your favorite star from your favorite show making it to the other side.\n\nIt\u2019s not been easy, and it\u2019s not always been happy. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen for Scott Wolf. But he found a way.\n\nYou see, Scott Wolf was going to be a businessman. Or something.\n\nHe went to college at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., because one of his older brother\u2019s friends went there and touted its awesomeness, which was more than enough for a teenage boy.\n\n\u201c It just felt safer to not feel stuff, because stuff felt scary. Stuff felt sad, you know? \u201d\n\nHe studied finance, because it seemed like the practical thing to do. It\u2019s what his dad did. It\u2019s at this point in recounting his biography that Wolf starts giggling and his dimples concave to such depth they could be officially classified as craters on a topographic map.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I was dating a girl,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was my high school girlfriend, who I had an engagement ring on layaway for and was making payments on. That had as much to do with it as anything.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that he was shunning the idea of acting to be reasonable, or stifling a creative itch in order to be responsible. The truth is, he had never really considered it. Now he knows why he never opened himself up to the idea. And he can also see exactly why it was the path he was always supposed to take.\n\nHis parents divorced when he was young, so he grew up in a house, he says, \u201cthat had maybe more than your average dysfunction.\u201d His stepfather \u201cwasn\u2019t Man of the Year in any of the years we lived with him; wasn\u2019t even nominated.\u201d His mother, who has since passed, was an alcoholic.\n\nThe house was not as safe as a house is supposed to feel for an 8-year-old, which Wolf was at the time, finding himself playing referee to his older and younger brothers. \u201cIt just felt safer to not feel stuff, because stuff felt scary,\u201d he says. \u201cStuff felt sad, you know?\u201d\n\nThe thing about clich\u00e9s is that they tend to be rooted in truth. So when so many actors talk about how TV and the movies were their salvations growing up, it may be cliched, but it\u2019s cliched for a reason.\n\nWolf remembers being 10 years old, acting as quiet as he could so that his mother wouldn\u2019t notice that he was staying up past his bedtime to catch episodes of St. Elsewhere. He remembers weeping at the end of them, he was so moved. The same thing would happen when his mom would take him into the city to see plays.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I was some 10-year-old kid going, like, I\u2019m looking through this television box at a real group of people,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew it was acting and I knew it was performance. But it made me feel more alive and human than anything else did.\u201d\n\nStill, it wasn\u2019t until a decade later, after a barbecue for his brother\u2019s birthday, that acting ever entered his mind. A friend of his father\u2019s was at the party, and he happened to be a former, though unsuccessful actor. After spending the afternoon with Wolf, he wrote Wolf\u2019s father a letter.\n\nHe admitted that what he was writing was crazy, especially since he couldn\u2019t make it in the industry himself, but he sensed something in Wolf that was undeniable. He was supposed to an actor. To his credit, Wolf\u2019s dad didn\u2019t light the letter on fire. In fact, he stuffed it in an envelope and mailed it to Wolf at his dorm in D.C.\n\nWolf was intrigued. He visited the head of the theater program at GW and explained that, insane though it sounded, he was a senior finance major and was thinking of abandoning it all for acting. How? And...help?\n\nHe created an independent study for Wolf, and gave him books not just on craft, but on what headshots are and how to get a manager.\n\n\u201cHe was the first person who was standing at the door of this whole new world, who could have closed it in my face. But he said, \u2018Come on in,\u2019\u201d Wolf says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have stopped me if he slammed the door. But you never know how something like that affects you moving forward, you know?\u201d\n\nAfter college he went to L.A. There were bit parts in Saved By the Bell and Blossom. Burt Reynolds cast him in two episodes of Evening Shade, his big break. Then came Party of Five, and the rest of his life.\n\nThere was a time right around the second season of Party of Five when it grew from critical darling that no one watched to pop-culture phenomenon that won a Golden Globe for Best Drama.\n\nWolf was reaping the benefits of being the new hot thing: a Laurel Canyon address where he could bunk in luxury with his younger brother, exclusive parties, and primo movie castings.\n\nIn this case, there was The Evening Star, a sequel to Terms of Endearment that would see Wolf trade in the intense drama of Party of Five to play a hunky underwear model dating Shirley MacLaine\u2019s granddaughter, and White Squall, a mid-\u201990s Ridley Scott movie primed to be one of those mid-\u201990s Ridley Scott massive hits. Wolf joined Jeff Bridges and an entire Teen People\u2019s issue of hot young stars in the cast: Jeremy Sisto, Ryan Phillippe, Ethan Embry, and Balthazar Getty.\n\nA 1996 Entertainment Weekly profile of Wolf spent its first few paragraphs debating whether it was more appropriate to call Wolf \u201cthe next Tom Cruise,\u201d given his good looks and magnetic personality, or \u201cthe next George Clooney,\u201d considering his TV-to-movies trajectory.\n\nThe dimples make a triumphant return when Wolf is reminded of this. \u201cThe way my mind works is you can have like 98 people say, \u2018I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re the next Tom Cruise or the next George Clooney.\u2019 And then two people say, \u2018He\u2019s like a wooden fool who should be a plumber.\u2019 Those are the ones you remember.\u201d\n\nWith a knowing smile, he insists that he enjoyed the spoils of his fame when it was all happening. And there was much attention paid to his celebrity.\n\nHe was at one point engaged to Alyssa Milano, in 1993. When he played a closeted gay actor in 1999\u2019s Go, rumor mills swirled about his own sexuality. Mostly though, there was fun\u2014and, thank god, fun that was shielded from today\u2019s constant flashes of iPhones, incessant celebrity coverage, and predatory tabloids.\n\n\u201cI did not hold back in my enjoyment of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cMy twenties and early thirties in L.A. were really a blast. I just feel like I was very lucky that when I got sort of slapped across the head with that whole first wave of fame, I saw it for exactly what it was. I was grateful for it because it meant that I could act, and maybe act for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201c I just feel like I was very lucky that when I got sort of slapped across the head with that whole first wave of fame, I saw it for exactly what it was. I was grateful for it because it meant that I could act, and maybe act for a while. \u201d\n\nWhen the producers of Nancy Drew were looking for someone to replace Freddie Prinze Jr., who played Nancy\u2019s father in the show\u2019s pilot, they reached out to Wolf because they thought he would be a positive influence on the show\u2019s young stars.\n\nHe almost can\u2019t believe it himself as he says it: \u201cNow I\u2019m the elder statesman.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Wolf starred in the indie movie 37: A Final Promise, about a depressed rock star who vows to kill himself on his 37th birthday, only to have plans complicated when he meets and falls in love with a woman.\n\nDuring the press he did for the film, he was adamant that he\u2019s never hit a point as low as his character suffers. But, while, generally speaking, happy, he has been through his fair share of tough shit.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, he talked about going through his own dark spell and bad patterns of behavior when he met his wife, Limp, in 2002, saying that she \u201csaved him.\u201d\n\nPressed to talk more about what he meant and what he was going through, he laughs and sighs. \u201cI want to talk about some fun stuff, too! I feel like I should be paying you $140 an hour.\u201d\n\nBut he obliged. A virtue of the way he grew up and from various experiences in his life, he never trusted that people were going to stick around when things got hard. If there was one thing that he had faith in, it was that the people closest to him would run for the hills when he needed them most.\n\nSo in relationships, when people started to get close, really close to him, \u201cI would start kind of poking and making life difficult for them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really unfair, but it was my way of like proving that you weren\u2019t gonna be able to do it. And then eventually, like any fucking sentient being who\u2019s poked enough, you leave. Then I would be like, \u2018See! I knew it.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe knew almost from the moment they met that Limp was his match. But patterns are patterns for a reason, and he started poking and prodding at her. It all came to a head on one night in New York City when he pushed her to the brink. As it was happening, he had an out-of-body experience, like he was watching his life, his entire chance at being happy, walk out the door.\n\nWhat happened over the next few hours he likens to a decade of therapy.\n\n\u201cI smashed apart a construct that I had built as an 8-year-old boy to protect myself,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t do that anymore\u2019 wasn\u2019t going to keep us together. That I managed to do that has everything to do with who she is and what she meant to me. The fact that she was powerful enough to believe me is the most incredible thing I\u2019ve ever been given.\u201d\n\nBefore they met, Wolf had been dating a lot in L.A. and experiencing the kind of frustration one gets when they\u2019re in their thirties and still haven\u2019t met their person. He vividly remembers one day that an episode of The Real World: New Orleans was on TV, on which Limp was a cast member, and seeing her and thinking, \u201cWhere\u2019s a girl like that in my life?\u201d\n\nSerendipity came when, a while later, a mutual friend set them up. Whenever they were in New York at the same time, they would go on epic, hours-long dates. On a whim, he invited her on a charity trip to Florida, and by the time they landed back in New York, he knew he was going to ask her to marry him.\n\nIt had been over a decade since he had put that diamond on layaway while he was at GW. \u201cFinally, I was able to use that ring,\u201d he laughs.\n\nLast June, Wolf celebrated turning 50 in a way that not many celebrate turning 50. He posted a photo of himself on Instagram shirtless , proudly displaying\u2014and we counted\u2014eight abs. \u201cIf posting a shirtless selfie at 50 years old is wrong...I don\u2019t want to be right. #thisis50 #youbetyourassidid,\u201d he wrote in the caption.\n\n\u201cI trained hard for that selfie,\u201d he says, grasping for his Old Fashioned like it could maybe save his life. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. Uh. Uh. I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\nThat he was in such great shape was a byproduct of his training to play Tommy Martino in Inside Game. In 2017, NBA referee Tim Donaghy, played by Eric Mabius, was caught gambling on games he officiated in concert with two men with connections to the Gambino crime family: bookie Baba Battista (Will Sasso), and a drug dealer named Tommy, Wolf\u2019s role.\n\nThe movie puts Wolf in full-on Italian mode\u2014he\u2019s referred to in the movie as \u201can Italian Ken doll\u201d\u2014with most scenes requiring him to be either lifting barbells at the gym or smoking a bong. In the opening sequence, he\u2019s caught having sex in a bathroom stall. Considering that Wolf has made an entire career of playing some of the nicest, most well-intentioned men to ever exist, it\u2019s a little jarring.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lucky and worked on a bunch of things over the years, but it had been a minute since I had done something that felt creatively demanding and fulfilling,\u201d he says. \u201cThis role and this project, and having that kind of demand placed on me creatively, it just put me back in contact with why, the why of why I\u2019ve always loved doing this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of existential, life stuff to think about it, but Wolf is relishing the opportunity to consider it all. He laughs about the post-mortem sure to happen when he meets his wife in a few minutes for dinner, as she\u2019s also just landed in New York City after leading a trip in South Africa as a life coach.\n\n\u201cTurning 50\u2019s a heavy thing, you know? It almost feels like the first mortality birthday. It\u2019s like, 30 is for worrying, \u2018How\u2019s my career going?\u2019 Forty is like, \u2018How does my whole life look, with family and work?\u2019 And 50 is like, \u2018I\u2019m going to die\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nHe lets out an exhausted guffaw, and drains the last bits of his drink. \u201cThere are days when you\u2019re like, eh, getting hit by a bus wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing ever. Now I\u2019m making sure to look both ways before crossing the street.\u201d", "description": "Twenty-five years after the premiere of \u201cParty of Five,\u201d Wolf gets candid about his unlikely path to stardom, true love, and, if you can believe it, playing Nancy Drew\u2019s...DAD.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572420833/191029-fallon-scott-wolff-tease_ilt8cy", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
