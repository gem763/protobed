Fave\n\nYet another company is making moves to become a super app.\n\nFave, previously known as Groupon, has launched a new Takeaway feature, which will allow customers to order meals via the Fave app and make payment via FavePay before picking them up at participating stores.\n\nA similar service called \u201cPickup\u201d is also available on food delivery company Food Panda\u2019s app.\n\nAccording to Fave\u2019s statement on Monday (Oct 14), collection time will be 30 minutes or less from the time of order. Users who \u201cdabao\u201d (colloquial term for take-out food) via the app will also be eligible for Fave\u2019s various cashback and rewards schemes.\n\nThe new feature follows the launch of Fave\u2019s Table Ordering service in May, which allows users to order and pay for their food by scanning a QR code placed on tables at participating eateries.\n\nAt the moment, 200 merchants are available via Takeaway, with more to follow by the end of the year, Fave said. Participating merchants at launch include: Paul, Wakufen, Menya Mushashi, Ajisen, Tuk Tuk Cha, Chicken Up and more.\n\nTakeaway will also be used at the upcoming Artbox Singapore, an outdoor market event from Thailand, said Fave.\n\nGrowing digitalisation in F&B\n\nJoel Neoh, co-founder and CEO of Fave, said: \u201cAs the Government is pushing for a more digital and seamless economy, Fave is helping SMEs adapt to the new landscape and in a more cost-effective way by giving them the tools to enable them to serve their customers in the best and and efficient way possible\u201d.\n\nHe added that the introduction of Takeaway is to enable merchants to \u201cget the most out of the platform by increasing productivity and revenue\u201d.\n\nEnterprise Singapore cites Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information & Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, as saying in 2018 that one-third of F&B outlets in Singapore were using at least one tech solution to boost their productivity. This is expected to grow to half of all F&B outlets by the year 2020.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, digital transformation is projected to contribute US$10 billion (S$13.2 billion) to Singapore\u2019s GDP by 2021.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - Over 200 merchants will be participating in the Takeaway launch, including Ajisen and Tuk Tuk Cha..
