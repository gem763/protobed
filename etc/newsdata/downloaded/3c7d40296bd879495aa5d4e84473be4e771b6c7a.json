Some people have no integrity at all or compassion.\"\n\nAnother added: \"I think we should all chip in a penny. Turn up with \u00a360 in pennies and tip them on their desk.\"\n\nWhen contacted by Mirror.co.uk a spokesman for the Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust said the fine had now been removed.\n\nA spokesman said: \u201cAs soon as this was brought to our attention, we contacted the company that handles our car parking and the fine was immediately cancelled.\n\n\u201cThe fines are automatically generated, but can be prevented by letting us know on the day in circumstances like this.\n\n\"Alternatively fines can be appealed, and in legitimate cases like this we will ensure no fine is paid.\n\n\u201cWe will be reviewing our processes to avoid a similar situation in future.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Horrified Michael Fogg received the penalty notice through the post after visiting Sheffield Children's Hospital last week", "authors": ["Rosaleen Fenton", "Image", "Pa", "Michael Fogg Facebook", "Google", "Supplied"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578823.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Shiregreen-incident-funeral.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
