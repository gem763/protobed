It\u2019s not a video game, a superhero or the title of a Grateful Dead song.\n\nIt\u2019s a new variety of apple, coming to a grocery store near you Dec. 1.\n\nCosmic Crisp is the first apple ever developed in Washington state, which grows the majority of the United States\u2019 apples. It\u2019s expected to be a game changer.\n\nAlready, growers have planted 12 million Cosmic Crisp apple trees, a sign of confidence in the new variety. While only 450,000 40-pound boxes will be available for sale this year, that will jump to more than 2 million boxes in 2020 and more than 21 million by 2026.\n\nThe apple variety was developed by Washington State University. Washington growers, who paid for the research, will have the exclusive right to sell it for the first 10 years.\n\nThe apple is called Cosmic Crisp because of the bright yellowish dots on its skin, which look like distant stars.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen an apple prettier in the orchard than these things are,\u201d said Aaron Clark of Yakima, whose family owns several orchards in central Washington and has planted 80 acres of Cosmic Crisps.\n\nIn this photo taken Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019, Sagrario Ochoa reaches to pick a Cosmic Crisp apple, a new variety and the first-ever bred in Washington state, in an orchard in Wapato, Wash. (Photo: Elaine Thompson, AP)\n\nAny takers? Samuel Adams is releasing a beer so strong 15 states made it illegal\n\nThe new variety keeps for a long time in storage and in the refrigerator, said Kate Evans, who runs the breeding program at Washington State University.\n\nAnd it\u2019s an exceptionally good \u201ceating apple,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ultra-crisp, very juicy and has a good balance of sweetness and tartness.\u201d\n\nCosmic Crisps are a cross between the disease-resistant Enterprise and the popular, crunchy Honeycrisp varieties. The Honeycrisp, nicknamed \u201cMoneycrisp\u201d by some growers, was the latest apple to spark a big buzz in the United States when it was introduced a couple of decades ago. It was developed by the University of Minnesota.\n\n\u201cThis apple (Cosmic Crisp) has a good opportunity to be a hit with a lot of people,\u201d said Clark, a vice president of Price Cold Storage, a company with orchards and fruit warehouses throughout central Washington. \u201cIt better be, because we are going to have a lot of them.\u201d\n\nIn this photo taken Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019, a worker moves bins of Cosmic Crisp apples, a new variety and the first-ever bred in Washington state, into a cold storage facility in Yakima, Wash.

The top varieties are Gala (23%), Red Delicious (20%) and Fuji (13%).\n\nApples are grown in the arid valleys and brown hillsides of central Washington, a few hours east of Seattle, and watered by irrigation projects.\n\nThe state has around 1,500 apple growers and 175,000 acres of orchards. About 50,000 people pick some 12 billion apples by hand each fall. The fruit is exported to 60 countries.\n\nWith so much success, why was a new apple variety needed?\n\n\u201cA new apple brings excitement,\u201d said Toni Lynn Adams, spokeswoman for the Washington Apple Commission, which markets apples internationally. \u201cA new variety can reinvigorate a market and industry.\u201d\n\nWashington growers, who had watched the market share for sometimes mushy Red Delicious apples plummet over time, were looking to replicate the success of the Honeycrisp, Adams said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to shake things up in a great way,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting it to increase in volume rapidly.\u201d\n\nAdams could not speculate on how much Cosmic Crisp apples will cost per pound.\n\n\u201cBetter quality makes for better returns,\u201d said Clark, the grower. \u201cThis is a for-profit deal, man. We\u2019re trying to make some money with it.\u201d\n\nIn this photo taken Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019, Aaron Clark, vice president of Price Cold Storage, cuts into a Cosmic Crisp apple, a new variety and the first-ever bred in Washington state, after pulling it off a tree in an orchard in Wapato, Wash.

In addition to helping pay for that research, apple growers need a license to buy the trees and pay a royalty on sales of the fruit.\n\nThe trees take three years to produce a crop, said Kathryn Grandy, a member of the team marketing the apple.\n\n\u201cThis will be the largest launch of a single variety ever, globally,\u201d she said, and it\u2019s backed by a $10.5 million marketing budget.\n\nConsumers will not have trouble finding the variety, said Grandy, who works for a company called Proprietary Variety Management and is based in the town of Chelan, in the heart of apple country.\n\nWork on developing the variety began in 1997, said Evans, of Washington State University. The process of cross-hybridization has been used to breed plants for hundreds of years, Evans said, and is quite different from the more controversial genetic modification methods.\n\n\u201cThe goal, in my opinion, is to get more consumers eating apples,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately that is the goal of any plant breeder.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/20/cosmic-crisp-apples-sale-december-2019-new-breed/4045896002/", "description": "Cosmic Crisp is the first apple ever developed in Washington.
