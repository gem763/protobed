BW CATCHER operates in the North Sea for Premier Oil and will use Onsight to improve communication with onshore support, enhancing operational efficiency.\n\nOnsight Connect remote expert software delivers a fully collaborative environment, giving teams access to augmented content for troubleshooting, assessment, and rapid resolution of issues in the field by bringing in virtual experts. Connect remote expert software powers a full range of mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, computers, and smart glasses for a consistent experience that fits any use case or environment across an enterprise.\n\nDeploying Connect for maintenance support onboard BW CATCHER will enable BW OFFSHORE to optimise maintenance and inspections by providing remote access to class surveyors, as well as internal and third-party support.\n\n\u201cIt can take up to two travelling days for sending onboard, surveyors from Oslo to one of our vessels on West Africa,\u201d said Gabriel de Moraes, Technical and Maintenance Coordinator, BW OFFSHORE, who is coordinating the Onsight augmented reality platform deployment. \u201cDepending on flight schedules, the surveyor may need to stay onboard for few days, even though their scope onboard may take just a couple of hours.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the cost and time savings, Connect can also increase safety by reducing the total number of exposure hours through remote collaboration. BW OFFSHORE selected Connect remote expert software for these reasons, along with its performance, optimization for low bandwidth, and user experience.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to have been selected by BW OFFSHORE, and to be utilized as part of the new and prestigious BW CATCHER operation,\u201d said Jereme Pitts, Librestream COO. \u201cThis adoption by BW OFFSHORE adds to the growing number of references Librestream has in the Oil & Gas sector.\u201d\n\nFor more information, contact:\n\nMarieke Wijtkamp\n\nVice President of Marketing & Client Services\n\nLibrestream Technologies Inc.\n\nMarieke.wijtkamp@librestream.com\n\nTel: +1 204.487.0612 ext. 259\n\nAbout Librestream\n\nLibrestream is empowering workers with technologies that help them rapidly diagnose, inspect, and maintain assets anywhere in the world.
