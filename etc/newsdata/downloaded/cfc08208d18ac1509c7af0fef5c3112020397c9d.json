Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) could bring articles of impeachment to the floor of the House within weeks \u2014 or she could leave the president twisting slowly in the wind. Her call.\n\nThat Trump committed at least one impeachable offense is not in question. He unilaterally withheld $391 million in military aid that Congress had authorized for Ukraine, which is menaced by Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. During a July 25 phone call, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his eagerness to acquire U.S. antitank missiles for his military. Having pointed out that the United States already does \u201ca lot for Ukraine,\u201d Trump responded to Zelensky\u2019s request for more missiles not with a yes or a no, but with a condition: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cfavor\u201d included working with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Attorney General William P. Barr to conduct an investigation of Joe Biden \u2014 shown by polls to be Trump\u2019s most formidable opponent in the coming election \u2014 and his son Hunter.\n\nAll of this is clearly laid out in the memorandum of the Trump-Zelensky conversation that the Trump administration released Wednesday. Despite repeatedly claiming it was a \u201cperfect\u201d phone call, Trump has handed the House all it needs for a single article of impeachment charging him with abuse of power. Republicans will argue that it\u2019s just fine for the president to conduct foreign policy in the manner of a two-bit mafia boss. Lots of luck with that.\n\n[Read the transcript of Eugene Robinson\u2019s latest live chat: The I-word]\n\nSince the evidence is public and undisputed, impeachment on that one charge could be wrapped up within weeks. There\u2019s one problem, though. At least one other offense almost surely has to be investigated: the apparent coverup of the attempted Ukraine shakedown.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint that brought the Trump-Zelensky phone call to light \u2014 a complaint judged \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d by the inspector general for the intelligence community \u2014 White House officials tried to \u201clock down\u201d records of the conversation and confined the full transcript to an electronic system reserved for only the most highly classified information, such as covert operations. That is not how phone calls between the president and world leaders are usually handled, and it suggests two things: that Trump\u2019s aides knew what the president was doing was wrong and that they tried to cover it up.\n\nIt is hard to imagine how Pelosi could take impeachment to the floor without looking into the apparent coverup \u2014 at least to ascertain whether Trump himself might have been involved. If evidence points to aides acting on their own, they can be dealt with later. Pelosi could still have the House vote to impeach Trump \u2014 and I do believe he would be impeached \u2014 by, say, Thanksgiving.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this is the best way to proceed. Trump\u2019s misconduct in the Ukraine-Biden matter is easy to understand, and the facts are not in dispute. Pelosi may calculate that keeping it simple is the best way to build public support for impeachment \u2014 and perhaps even bring a few Republicans on board.\n\nShe will also have to take history into account, however. In the impeachment inquiry against Richard M. Nixon \u2014 cut short by his resignation \u2014 Congress dealt with a criminal president by throwing the kitchen sink at him. An attempt was made to look at the whole range of Nixon\u2019s conduct and, in the process, paint a broad and detailed portrait of a lawless administration.\n\n[Submit a question for Eugene Robinson\u2019s Oct. 1 live chat]\n\nIndeed, there is already a trove of evidence that Trump committed other impeachable crimes. The investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III established, to the satisfaction of more than 1,000 former prosecutors, that Trump could be charged with obstructing justice in the Russia probe. The president is also illegally withholding documents and witnesses from congressional committees seeking to fulfill their constitutional responsibility of oversight.\n\nBut the kitchen-sink approach would stretch impeachment well into 2020, which, I believe I mentioned, is an election year. And as a practical matter, trying to get one\u2019s arms around the totality of Trump\u2019s impeachable conduct is a Sisyphean task. By the time you\u2019ve ticked one item off the list, you\u2019ve added two more.\n\nOn Thursday, at a breakfast with U.S. diplomats, Trump described the whistleblower who brought the Zelensky conversation to light as \u201cclose to a spy\u201d and thuggishly added, \u201cThe spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nThe assembled diplomats were reportedly shocked. The nation has suffered this small, foolish, dangerous man long enough. Pelosi should damn the torpedoes and move full speed ahead.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The House should move to impeach the president ASAP.", "authors": ["Eugene Robinson", "Columnist Focusing On Politics", "September At Pm", "Eugene Robinson Writes A Twice-A-Week Column On Politics", "Culture", "Hosts A Weekly Online Chat With Readers.
