Digital nomads live to travel and take on remote work to support their lifestyle.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while their life may sound idyllic, nomads take on a whole new set of problems.\n\nWhen it comes to managing finances on the road, a multi-currency account can be a digital nomad\u2019s best friend. A multi-currency account (MCA) is an account that allows you to keep money in multiple currencies. They can be used to make transactions in foreign currencies without additional conversion fees and also withdraw cash in different currencies \u2013 enabling anyone to live like a local wherever they are.\n\nIf you\u2019re aspiring to pack your laptop and live the life of freedom, here are four reasons why you should open an MCA.\n\n1. It\u2019s a one-stop shop for all financial needs\n\nMoving to a new city used to mean having to set up a new bank account, but if you\u2019re planning to country-hop, the process can be tiresome and time-consuming.\n\nMCAs make it easier for you to access your funds from anywhere. Instead of setting up a new account in each country, the MCA can be used for all transactions. Revolut, for instance, allows you to spend in more than 150 countries at the interbank exchange rate. A flat mark-up on weekends and on certain currencies may apply.\n\nA digital wallet MCA comes with an app that allows you to open a new account in minutes, making it easy for you to manage your money on the go.\n\n2. There are no surprise charges\n\nManaging different currencies on the go means a constant struggle to avoid surprise charges. These charges could include:\n\nBank administrative fees: About 1.5%-3% per transaction made using your home bank in a foreign country. Fees are dependent on the bank and the credit card you use.\n\nUnfavourable rate of exchange: Some credit card providers charge the day\u2019s rates or rates that may be up to 3 to 5 days late.\n\nDynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) fee: Charged when the amount of a Visa or MasterCard transaction is converted from the local currency to your home currency. This is usually 3%, but at times have gone as high as 18%. This is also why it\u2019s always better to pay in local currency when overseas.\n\nAn MCA allows you to change multiple currencies at the rate you prefer or at the real-time rate and store it in your account until you choose to use it or withdraw it as cash. Paying in the local currency allows you to avoid DCC fees, and storing foreign currency in your account means that you can always change money at the best rates. With Revolut, you don\u2019t even have to store currencies in a separate account. Just perform a transaction and the amount will automatically be converted from your base currency at an interbank exchange rate with no ridiculous fees.\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t avoid transaction charges completely. Revolut only charges a small 0.5% fee if you exceed a certain amount each month depending on the plan you\u2019re on. The free limit amount is a high S$9,000 per month for users on the Standard plan, and a weekend exchange charge applies on certain currencies. Users on the Premium plan and the upcoming Metal plan have these limits lifted. This is still much lower than the 1.5%-3% bank admin fees and foreign currency exchange fees usually charged per transaction.\n\n3. Easy access to cash when overseas\n\nWhen it comes to ATM withdrawals too, there may be additional charges that can arise. If you decide to work out of developing countries, especially in Southeast Asia, cash is still heavily used. If you\u2019re planning to country-hop, you may be tempted to carry a bulk of different currencies on you, especially if you can get a good rate. But carrying a lot of cash on you could be dangerous when you\u2019re on the road.\n\nInstead, convert and store that foreign currency in your MCA, and only withdraw the money you need at an ATM when you need it. Revolut allows you to withdraw from any ATM globally where Visa cards are accepted without being levied with ridiculous withdrawal charges. In some countries, international ATM usage might levy a charge, but, like the admin and foreign currency exchange fees, Revolut will not \u2013 subject to your fair usage plan limits.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Everyone loves to travel, but some people take it an extra step further.
