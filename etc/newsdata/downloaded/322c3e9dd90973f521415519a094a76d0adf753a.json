Dig those glasses, right?

That\u2019s right, Rachel Maddow is coming to Batwoman.\n\nAs the Hollywood Reporter explains, Maddow, MSNBC news host, will be joining the CW superhero drama in the role of Vesper Fairchild. In the comics, Vesper Fairchild is a TV and radio news commentator who hooked up with Bruce Wayne. In the show, she\u2019ll play a prominent critic of Batwoman, though there\u2019s a catch: Maddow will be appearing voice only.\n\n\u201cWe consider Vesper Fairchild to be the sardonic Voice of Gotham,\u201d showrunner Carolie Dries told THR. \u201cIn addition to Rachel\u2019s interest in Batwoman, we thought she\u2019d be the perfect casting choice because her own hard-hitting journalism wildly contrasts Vesper\u2019s penchant for snark, gossip and criticism of female superheroes.\u201d\n\nI know no one's going to believe this is true, but it's true. I'm \"Vesper Fairchild\" in the new Batwoman TV show that starts this Sunday night on The CW.
