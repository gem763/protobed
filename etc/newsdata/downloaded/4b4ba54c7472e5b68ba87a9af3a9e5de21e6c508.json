AFP/Getty Images\n\nRuiz and Joshua made the second stop of a three-day tour to promote the rematch that few outside Ruiz\u2019s camp thought would be necessary. The fight at Madison Square Garden was the first in the US for Joshua (22-1, 21 KOs), and it wasn\u2019t expected to end with him going back to Britain without his WBA, IBF and WBO belts.\n\nBut he was knocked down four times by Ruiz (33-1, 22 KOs), who was a late replacement after Jarrell Miller failed multiple drug tests. The victory that was assumed looked likely when Joshua knocked Ruiz down in the third round, but Joshua may have been too eager to make a statement and got careless in going for the knockout.\n\n\u201cI was like, this is it, which may have been my downfall,\u201d Joshua said.\n\nJoshua\u2019s promoters originally targeted Britain for the rematch. Instead, they decided to go to the Middle East, ignoring criticism of the selection because of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record.\n\nThe fighters started their tour there Wednesday, and Ruiz said he found good food and good treatment, alleviating his concerns about the event\u2019s location after hoping it would have returned to New York.\n\n\u201cThis is where it all happened, where I became the first Mexican-American heavyweight champion of the world and it would have been cool if the fight was right here, but it\u2019s going to be amazing over there in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\nJoshua blamed himself for the loss and said he will make things right in the rematch. He expects to benefit from a few months to train for Ruiz and the quicker-than-expected hand speed he possesses for a guy with his portly frame, after having little time to prepare for the June bout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Ruiz more this week than I did in the whole build-up to the last fight,\u201d Joshua said.\n\nThe extra time should also aid the champion. Joshua looks like he lives in the gym and Ruiz looks like a guy whose gym membership expired, but Ruiz\u2019s trainer said the fighter will be slimmer and in better shape for the rematch. Ruiz said his target weight is 255 pounds, 13 fewer than in the first fight, but he downplays the focus on his figure, anyway.\n\n\u201cYou know what, just the way that I look don\u2019t mean nothing,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cWhat matters is being in the ring and ready to fight, that\u2019s what really matters.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "Wearing a black sombrero on his head and a big grin on his face, Andy Ruiz Jr\u00a0looked like a guy who wants to keep the party going.
