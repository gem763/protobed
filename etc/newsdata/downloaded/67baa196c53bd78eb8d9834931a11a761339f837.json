So this is something I\u2019ve been working for months and months, and it\u2019s got just a little more work until it\u2019s finished.\u201d\n\nDuring the fourth Democratic debate on October 19, Warren was chastised by fellow Senator Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg for refusing to acknowledge that an increase in middle-class taxes would be required to fund the plan.\n\nWhen Warren was asked again on Sunday if middle-class taxes would go up under her plan, she deflected, saying, \u201cThe whole plan will be out \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to look at it.\u201d\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), who introduced the legislation on the Senate floor in 2017, has not shied away from explaining that middle-class taxes will go up under Medicare for All, assuaging concerns with a pledge that total costs will be less than they are currently. \u201cThe tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions,\u201d Sanders said during the Ohio debate. The original bill does not address how the single-payer system will be funded.\n\nButtigieg, who last week released an ad claiming that Warren and Sanders were \u201cinfringing on freedom\u201d with their Medicare for All proposals, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday that he thinks Warren is being \u201cevasive\u201d on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe need to see how this is going to be paid for,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cRight now, whether you copy-paste the Bernie Sanders math or do it some other way, there is a hole amounting to trillions of dollars in how this is supposed to work.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "After facing heavy criticism from fellow candidates during the last Democratic debate for evading questions about funding her Medicare for All proposal, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) announced Sunday at an event in Iowa that she was \u201cgetting close\u201d to a funding plan after \u201cworking for a long time", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ptqvYVIB5Fr22S6skfYg8A--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/abd36c33b25acbd9959e4f6fbc6a8d48", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
