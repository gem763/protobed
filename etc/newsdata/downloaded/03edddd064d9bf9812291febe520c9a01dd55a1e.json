Formally called international mobile subscriber identity-catchers or IMSI-catchers, they also can capture the contents of calls and data use.\n\nThe devices were likely intended to spy on President Donald Trump, one of the former officials said, as well as his top aides and closest associates -- though it\u2019s not clear whether the Israeli efforts were successful.\n\nPresident Trump is reputed to be lax in observing White House security protocols. POLITICO reported in May 2018 that the president often used an insufficiently secured cell phone to communicate with friends and confidants. The New York Times subsequently reported in October 2018 that \u201cChinese spies are often listening\u201d to Trump\u2019s cell-phone calls, prompting the president to slam the story as \u201cso incorrect I do not have time here to correct it.\u201d (A former official said Trump has had his cell phone hardened against intrusion.)\n\nBy then, as part of tests by the federal government, officials at the Department of Homeland Security had already discovered evidence of the surveillance devices around the nation\u2019s capital, but weren\u2019t able to attribute the devices to specific entities. The officials shared their findings with relevant federal agencies, according to a letter a top DHS official, Christopher Krebs, wrote in May 2018 to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Israel doesn\u2019t conduct espionage operations in the United States, period.\u201d\n\nA senior Trump administration official said the administration doesn\u2019t \u201ccomment on matters related to security or intelligence.\u201d The FBI declined to comment, while DHS and the Secret Service didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut former officials with deep experience dealing with intelligence matters scoff at the Israeli claim \u2014 a pro forma denial Israeli officials are also known to make in private to skeptical U.S. counterparts.\n\nOne former senior intelligence official noted that after the FBI and other agencies concluded that the Israelis were most likely responsible for the devices, the Trump administration took no action to punish or even privately scold the Israeli government.\n\n\u201cThe reaction ... was very different than it would have been in the last administration,\u201d this person said. \u201cWith the current administration, there are a different set of calculations in regard to addressing this.\u201d\n\nThe former senior intelligence official criticized how the administration handled the matter, remarking on the striking difference from past administrations, which likely would have at a very minimum issued a d\u00e9marche, or formal diplomatic reprimand, to the foreign government condemning its actions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any accountability at all,\u201d said the former official.\n\nBeyond trying to intercept the private conversations of top officials \u2014 prized information for any intelligence service \u2014 foreign countries often will try to surveil their close associates as well. With the president, the former senior Trump administration official noted, that could include trying to listen in on the devices of the people he regularly communicates with, such as Steve Wynn, Sean Hannity and Rudy Giuliani.\n\n\u201cThe people in that circle are heavily targeted,\u201d said the former Trump official.\n\nAnother circle of surveillance targets includes people who regularly talk to Trump\u2019s friends and informal advisers. Information obtained from any of these people \u201cwould be so valuable in a town that is like three degrees of separation like Kevin Bacon,\u201d the former official added.\n\nThat\u2019s true even for a close U.S. ally like Israel, which often seeks an edge in its diplomatic maneuvering with the United States.\n\n\u201cThe Israelis are pretty aggressive\u201d in their intelligence gathering operations, said a former senior intelligence official. \u201cThey\u2019re all about protecting the security of the Israeli state and they do whatever they feel they have to to achieve that objective.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with President Donald Trump. | Michael Reynolds/Getty Images\n\nSo even though Trump has formed a warm relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and made numerous policy moves favorable to the Israeli government \u2014 such as moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, ripping up the Iran nuclear deal and heavily targeting Iran with sanctions \u2014 Israel became a prime suspect in planting the devices.\n\nWhile the Chinese, who have been regularly caught doing intelligence operations in the U.S., were also seen as potential suspects, they were determined as unlikely to have placed the devices based on a close analysis of the devices.\n\n\u201cYou can often, depending upon the tradecraft of the people who put them in place, figure out who\u2019s been accessing them to pull the data off the devices,\u201d another former senior U.S. intelligence official explained.\n\nWashington is awash in surveillance, and efforts of foreign entities to try to spy on administration officials and other top political figures are fairly common. But not many countries have the capability \u2014 or the budget \u2014 to plant the devices found in this most recent incident, which is another reason suspicion fell on Israel.\n\nIMSI-catchers, which are often used by local police agencies to surveil criminals, can also be made by sophisticated hobbyists or by the Harris Corporation, the manufacturer of StingRays, which cost more than $150,000 each, according to Vice News.\n\n\u201cThe costs involved are really significant,\u201d according to a former senior Trump administration official. \u201cThis is not an easy or ubiquitous practice.\u201d\n\nMorning Cybersecurity A daily briefing on politics and cybersecurity \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But they do sometimes make mistakes and are \u201cnot 10 feet tall like you see in the movies,\u201d a former senior intelligence official noted.\n\nIn 2010, the secret covers of a Mossad hit team, some of whom had been posing as tennis players, were blown after almost 30 minutes of surveillance video was posted online of them going through a luxury Dubai hotel where they killed a top Hamas terrorist in his room.\n\nStill, U.S. officials sometimes have been taken aback by Israel\u2019s brazen spying. One former U.S. government official recalled his frequent concern that Israel knew about internal U.S. policy deliberations that were meant to be kept private.\n\n\u201cThere were suspicions that they were listening in,\u201d the former official said, based on his Israeli counterparts flaunting a level of detailed knowledge \u201cthat was hard to explain otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it was sort of knowledge of our thinking. Occasionally there were some turns of phrase like language that as far as we knew had only appeared in drafts of speeches and never been actually used publicly, and then some Israeli official would repeat it back to us and say, \u2018This would be really problematic if you were to say X,\u2019\u201d said the former official.\n\nBack when the Obama administration was trying to jump-start negotiations with the Palestinians, for example, the Israelis were eager to get advance knowledge of the language being debated that would describe the terms of reference of the talks.\n\n\u201cThey would have had interest in what language [President Barack] Obama or [Secretary of State John] Kerry or someone else was going to use and might indeed try to find a way to lobby for language they liked or against language that they didn\u2019t like and so having knowledge of that could be advantageous for them,\u201d the former official said.\n\n\u201cThe Israelis are aggressive intelligence collectors, but they have sworn off spying on the U.S. at various points and it\u2019s not surprising that such efforts continue,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, a former coordinator of counterrorism at the State Department and now director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth.\n\nHe recalled once meeting with a head of Mossad, the premier Israeli intelligence agency. The first thing the official told Benjamin was that Israel didn\u2019t spy on the U.S.\n\n\u201cI just told him our conversation was over if he had such a low estimate of my intelligence,\u201d Benjamin said.\n\nIsraeli officials often note in conversations with their American counterparts \u2014 correctly \u2014 that the U.S. regularly gathers intelligence on Israeli leaders.\n\nAs for Israel\u2019s recent surveillance of the White House, one of the former senior U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged it raised security concerns but joked, \u201cOn the other hand, guess what we do in Tel Aviv?\u201d\n\n", "description": "The likely Israeli spying efforts were uncovered during the Trump presidency, several former top U.S. officials said.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e2/d5/bcfbedf64059a60391c323951235/stingray-final.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
