Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRask picked up his second shutout of the season as the Bruins got revenge in the same building where they lost a decisive Game 7 to the Blues in June. Pastrnak\u2019s goal was his ninth during his streak, and Anders Bjork also scored in Boston\u2019s second straight victory.\n\nBrandon Carlo added an empty-netter for Boston with 49 seconds left.\n\nJordan Binnington had 21 saves for St. Louis, which had a two-game winning streak end.\n\nThe game was testy from the start, Boston captain Zdeno Chara laying out St. Louis\u2019 Oskar Sundqvist with a hit 38 seconds in. Brayden Schenn stepped in, and he and Chara went off for offsetting roughing penalties.\n\nPerhaps a motivator was that Sundqvist was suspended a game during the Stanley Cup Final for a dangerous hit from behind on Bruins defenseman Matt Grzelcyk.\n\nBoston\u2019s Torey Krug and St. Louis\u2019 David Perron would get tangled up at 6:13 of the period, resulting in another pair of offsetting penalties.\n\nWith Perron back in the box for holding later in the first, Pastrnak connected on a one-timer that trickled past Binnington after the goaltender got a piece for a 1-0 Bruins lead at 14:59. Brad Marchand assisted to extend his points streak to nine games, while Pastrnak has points in eight straight.\n\nThe Bruins have also scored power-play goals in six consecutive contests.\n\nBoston doubled its lead at 9:31 of the second period when Bjork took advantage of a 3-on-2 to one-time a shot into the top of the net and end a 17-game goalless drought. Grzelcyk and Danton Heinen assisted.\n\nRask survived a hectic St. Louis power play midway through the second to preserve his clean sheet. The Blues went 0-for-4 on the man advantage.\n\nSt. Louis played without forward Vladimir Tarasenko, who is out at least through Sunday\u2019s game at Detroit with an upper-body injury sustained Thursday.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Tuukka Rask stopped all 26 shots he faced, David Pastrnak extended his goal streak to five games and the Boston Bruins beat the visiting St. Louis Blues 3-0 Saturday night in a rematch of last season's Stanley Cup Final.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445377700&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q04Q-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
