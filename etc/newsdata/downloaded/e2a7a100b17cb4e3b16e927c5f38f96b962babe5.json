And George Lopez said, \u2018I\u2019m coming to get you,\u2019\u201d Hall recalled.\n\nLopez took Hall to a venue in Santa Ynez, Calif., where Lopez had a show scheduled for that evening, and coaxed Hall into warming up the crowd.\n\n\u201cThat night, I got bit by the bug again, and I haven\u2019t been off stage for more than four nights a week since,\u201d he said.\n\nHall said returning to stand-up pulled him out of a funk brought on by the cancellation.\n\n\u201cI used stand-up as my way to heal from that experience,\u201d he said. \u201cStand-up saved my life.\u201d\n\n\u2018Smart & Classy\u2019\n\nThe new stand-up special, Smart & Classy, which streams Tuesday on Netflix, was a way for the comedian to \u201crefocus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m free now, and that\u2019s what\u2019s great about my stand-up, and that\u2019s what\u2019s great about getting back to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a stand-up, I was struggling to be famous and rich, so I could take care of my family in Cleveland. Now that I am famous and rich, my voice is different; I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d\n\nSmart & Classy includes jokes about being mistaken for other black celebrities, as well as Hall\u2019s complicated feelings about his former idol, Bill Cosby.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know I do stand-up, and when they come, they\u2019re probably surprised by a lot of things,\u201d he said.\n\nOne thing that he said particularly surprises people is learning Hall, who won the 2007 season of Celebrity Apprentice, does not get along with the show\u2019s then-host, President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf you win Celebrity Apprentice, people probably think Trump loves you,\u201d Hall said. \u201cHe found out I was good on that show, but as a man, I\u2019m probably not his cup of tea.\u201d\n\nStanding for something\n\nHall said his relationship with Trump soured when he confronted the future president about his claims that Barack Obama was born in Kenya.\n\n\u201cI was saying, \u2018This makes you sound crazy, and it definitely makes you sound racist to take the greatest black political accomplishment in America and try to make it something that should not exist because he\u2019s not even from here. Do you understand how black people see that?\u2019\u201d Hall said.\n\n\u201cAnd he gave me the whole thing, \u2018Well, first of all, if someone thinks I\u2019m racist, that\u2019s ridiculous, I\u2019m the furthest thing from racist.\u2019 And I start another sentence and he just walks away from me.\u201d\n\nHe said Trump called him \u201cdisloyal\u201d and \u201ca loser\u201d in a subsequent magazine interview, and his only interaction after their face-to-face meeting was receiving a note from real estate mogul.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy, he doesn\u2019t text you, he will write on a newspaper or something, then he\u2019ll take a photo of it and he\u2019ll have someone email it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was angry at the way I approached certain interviews \u2026 but that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\nHall said he doesn\u2019t consider his own political views to be partisan, but Trump\u2019s presidency causes him to \u201cworry about the future of our children and the future of this great country.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dad was a Republican, my mother was a Democrat \u2014 my wallet is a Republican, my soul is a Democrat. I go both ways when it comes to politics, but I know this man, and I worry.\u201d\n\nHall said even his jokes about Cosby, who has been accused of rape and sexual assault by more than 50 women, have struck some notes of controversy with audience members who believe the 82-year-old comedian is not guilty.\n\n\u201cYou have to call a lot of people a liar to still go out and buy a Cosby album,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think there\u2019s a certain point where we have to listen to the women in our society.\u201d\n\nHe said listening to women led him to pass on a project with Harvey Weinstein about a year before the entertainment mogul\u2019s alleged sexual assaults were exposed by journalist Ronan Farrow.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes you\u2019ve got to stand for something or you\u2019ll fall for everything,\u201d he said.\n\nComing 2 America\n\nHall and longtime friend and collaborator Eddie Murphy are filming Coming 2 America, a sequel to the 1989 film that followed African Prince Akeem (Murphy) traveling undercover to New York City with best friend Semmi (Hall) to experience ordinary life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say this, he\u2019s still getting into mischief,\u201d Hall said of Semmi\u2019s role in the sequel. \u201cHe\u2019s still single, and living the opposite life of Akeem. But they\u2019re still close. Semi loves women, Akeem is a settled-down, wonderful man. Semmi\u2019s a nut.\u201d\n\nHall said he\u2019s probably finished with the talk show format. He now considers the reboot season to be a \u201cvictory lap\u201d in which he performed some of the last televised interviews with beloved figures including Prince and Maya Angelou.\n\nHe said the niche his show filled in the 1990s has largely been taken over by YouTube and social media.\n\n\u201cI think now, the Arsenio Hall of our society is Charlamagne tha God,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s morning New York radio that you can get on YouTube anytime you want.\u201d\n\nHall recalled how rapper Tupac Shakur, who died in 1996, would come on his show to make announcements and respond to media reports.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about Tupac calling me and saying, \u2018Yo, man, they got me hemmed up in some [expletive], can I come on the show and talk?\u2019 Tupac used to use my show like you use Twitter.\n\n\u201cSo maybe I was the Twitter of that era. But now, I think if Tupac were alive and had something he needed to get off his chest, he\u2019d probably fly to New York and run up to Charlamagne.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not coming on till October 29th, but I can\u2019t wait any longer to tell you. \u201cI\u2019m so excited, and I just can\u2019t hide it\u201d.
