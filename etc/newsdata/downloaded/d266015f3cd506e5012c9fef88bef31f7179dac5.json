He was selected by two Democratic attorney generals to do sensitive investigations for them,\u201d Barr said of Durham, the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut. \u201cHe\u2019s a by-the-book kind of guy. He\u2019s thorough and fair, and I\u2019m confident he\u2019s going to get to the bottom of things.\u201d\n\nLast week, reports broke that the Justice Department has elevated the status of Durham\u2019s administrative probe to a criminal inquiry. The news caused a mixed reaction on Capitol Hill, with House Democratic chairmen Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff decrying the Department of Justice as \u201ca vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge.\u201d Representative Doug Collins (R., Ga.), the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, defended the move as \u201can effort to deliver truth and accountability.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Barr which questioned the attorney general\u2019s impartiality in conducting the probe while in the midst of impeachment.\n\n\u201cImpartial enforcement of the law is essential to give the American public confidence in the Justice Department\u2019s work,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cYour personal connection to these matters creates the appearance of a conflict of interest and gives rise to questions about whether the Department is being used to advance the President\u2019s personal interests.\u201d\n\nSchiff said on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos\u201d Sunday that he thinks the Durham probe is \u201cillegitimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can assign good people to do an illegitimate investigation. You can assign good people to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals. It doesn\u2019t mean that the investigation is any less tainted. This is tainted because of the motivation which is a political one to serve the president\u2019s political interests,\u201d he said.\n\nBarr also took a swipe at former FBI Director James Comey on Monday, saying current director Christopher Wray has been \u201coutstanding in the support and responsiveness they\u2019ve given\u201d to Durham.\n\n\u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve said previously that I felt there was a failure of leadership at the bureau in 2016 and part of 2017, but since Director Wray and his team have taken over there\u2019s been a world of change. I think that he is restoring the steady professionalism that\u2019s been a hallmark of the FBI,\u201d Barr said.", "description": "Last week, reports broke that the Justice Department has elevated the status of Durham\u2019s administrative probe to a criminal inquiry.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
