Photo: Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros.\n\nThis article was originally published during 2019\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival. We are republishing the piece as the film hits theaters this weekend.\n\nFew films from this year\u2019s fall festival season have aroused as much curiosity as Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker. The supervillain movie unexpectedly took home the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, an honor previously awarded to the likes of Roma, The Shape of Water, and Brokeback Mountain \u2014 a sign that, against all odds, the film will likely crack the end-of-year awards race. The Oscar buzz for Joker has also been accompanied by controversy over the film\u2019s handling of toxic masculinity, as its version of the character bears many similarities to the perpetrators of recent mass shootings. Combine all that with the usual intense fan interest that greets most of today\u2019s comic-book films, and it\u2019s a heady mix. If you\u2019ve read our review from Venice, or our review from Toronto, and you still have questions about Joker, well, I did my duty and saw the film at TIFF, and now I\u2019m here to answer them.\n\nIs this Joker movie connected to any of the 8,000 other movies with the Joker in them?\n\nNope! This is a stand-alone movie unconnected to the rest of the DC Universe, so stand-alone that just this week Phillips seemed to rule out the idea of a sequel. It\u2019s a period piece, being rather explicitly set in the early \u201980s, and its aesthetic owes more to Scorsese films like Taxi Driver than other comic-book films. (I would not be 100 percent surprised if the movie began life as a realist social drama before being retconned into a movie about the Joker.) It\u2019s also different in being an origin story. DC Comics canon has presented a multitude of possible explanations for how the Joker became the Joker, but this film throws almost all of them out, save a little bit seemingly inspired by the Joker\u2019s backstory in Alan Moore\u2019s The Killing Joke. In this telling, Joker is Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill part-time clown who dreams of becoming a stand-up comic before an endless string of indignities from a cruel, uncaring society spurs him toward violence.\n\nYou\u2019re saying everybody betrays him and he\u2019s fed up with this world? Is this movie The Room?\n\nThat\u2019s not the first movie I would have thought of, but now that you mention it, Joker is not completely dissimilar to The Room! Except played straight and, you know, well-made. Other commonalities with The Room include Joker\u2019s strange bouts of laughter (here the result of a childhood brain injury), and the frequent shirtless scenes for leading man Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nYes, talk about the shirtless scenes, please.\n\nOf course! Phoenix has said he lost 52 pounds for the role, and it shows; the sinews on his back practically deserve a supporting-actor campaign of their own. Joker spends much of this movie in motion, writhing in pain or dancing to the beat of his own strange drum, and Phillips frequently strips him naked to the waist so we can see just how odd his physical form is. Phoenix isn\u2019t Machinist-skinny \u2014 he\u2019s lean but still has a tiny paunch, like a certain blogger I could mention \u2014 though his weight loss feels similarly effortful. This is not a look that you can get by accident, and these sequences feel like a dark mirror to the clean-cut, protein-shaked shirtless scenes of the MCU. (Also, despite being a skinny mini, Joker still somehow wins a tug-of-war against a character played by Brian Tyree Henry. Movie magic!)\n\nI know you said it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, but do any other familiar characters from the Batman universe pop up?\n\nIndeed: Bruce Wayne\u2019s father, Thomas, is a key supporting player. The twist in Joker is that this time, he\u2019s an asshole! Thomas Wayne is the richest man in Gotham, and he spends the film mulling a Bloomberg-style mayoral run, while also taking time to periodically insult the city\u2019s underclass. (Since this is a story set in the Batman universe, you can probably guess what happens to him.) We also get a scene with the young Bruce Wayne and his British manservant Alfred, who receives a slightly darker portrayal than the kindly old gent of most Batman movies, or his recent sexy incarnation. Oh, and the film also heavily implies that Joker is a blood relative of one of Gotham City\u2019s most famous residents. Which one? I\u2019ll never tell!\n\nHow close is the movie to the leaked Joker script that was going around?\n\nThat script appears to date from a few months before production began, and while there are a few differences in the details, the plot, characters, and tone remain largely unchanged from script to film. If you\u2019ve read it, there will still be some surprises in store, but you\u2019ll recognize it as essentially the same movie.\n\nI\u2019ve seen it written that the movie is \u201ca portrait of the supervillain as the original incel.\u201d Is Joker an incel?\n\nTo fully dive into the question of whether Joker is sexually active would require spoiling more of the movie than I\u2019m comfortable with. I\u2019ll just say that, while this Joker could be taken as an avatar for the incel movement, the film does do away with one particular misogynist trope that popped up in the script. There is still a lot of masculine rage in Joker, but it\u2019s directed more at society as a whole than at women in particular. Also, for what it\u2019s worth, the majority of Joker\u2019s victims are men. (Usually men who are a lot more obviously loathsome than Joker, but that\u2019s a whole nother line of criticism.)\n\nDo you think the film is going to be as controversial as early Venice reviews indicated?\n\nAfter the Aurora shooting, a gritty, realistic movie about the Joker was already going to have people\u2019s guard up more than the typical anti-hero drama would. Since its premiere, critics have gone back and forth over whether Joker is merely depicting its protagonist\u2019s twisted worldview or celebrating it. Our own David Edelstein warns that it \u201cpanders to selfish, small-minded feelings of resentment,\u201d while writers at The Guardian and The Hollywood Reporter have penned preemptive defenses, decrying as overly simplistic any attempts to link the film with real-life violence. I don\u2019t think this will die down before the movie\u2019s premiere, no.\n\nHow violent is it?\n\nIt\u2019s bloody, for sure. Still, I wouldn\u2019t say that any of it is necessarily any more extreme than you would find in other R-rated dramas. Someone gets stabbed, a few people get shot \u2014 it\u2019s graphic, but it\u2019s the kind of screen violence you\u2019ve seen many times before. Reports of the movie\u2019s outrageous gore feel a bit like marketing to me, and I suspect that Phillips is not altogether unhappy with the suggestion that he\u2019s made something really dark and twisted.\n\nSpeaking of dark and twisted, does the movie really play \u201cSend in the Clowns\u201d over scenes of Joker doing bad-guy stuff?\n\nAre you kidding? The movie plays \u201cSend in the Clowns\u201d more than A Star Is Born played \u201cShallow.\u201d The first instance comes when Joker is mockingly serenaded by three Sondheim-loving Wall Street types on the subway, on his way home from a terrible day at his clowning gig. (Everyone in this movie calls rich dudes who work in finance \u201cWall Street guys,\u201d so I guess Gotham also has a Wall Street.) Later, Frank Sinatra\u2019s version pops up on the soundtrack, as does a piano version by Ferrante & Teicher. Since the song appeared in the Joker trailer many fans of musical theater have pointed out that \u201cSend in the Clowns\u201d is not about actual clowns; however, since Joker turns out to share one specific plot element with A Little Night Music, the show the song comes from, I personally give the movie a pass.\n\nOne final question: When did everybody start calling him \u201cJoker\u201d instead of \u201cthe Joker\u201d?\n\nI have no idea.", "description": "Everything you wanted to know about the \u201cJoker\u201d movie, from Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s weight loss to the controversy over the violence.", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/17/17-joker-faq.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
