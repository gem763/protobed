Gilreath had previously been under an FBI investigation, but not criminally charged, after he allegedly posted \u201chunting guides\u201d about how to kill Jews, Muslims, and refugees.\n\nThe new search warrants for Gilreath\u2019s web presence show that investigators want to know if he shared child porn with other users on the social networking sites. The search warrant for Gab is more extensive, asking for information on Gilreath\u2019s possible financial transactions, associates, messages, and login history.\n\nThe warrants also shed more light on the extremist circles Gilreath frequented online. (Currently the criminal charges do not accuse him of sharing child pornography on Gab or Twitter.)\n\nOn Gab and Twitter, Gilreath posted as \u201cNatSat\u201d or \u201cNational Satanist,\u201d according to the search warrant first noted by Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism. The \u201cNatSat\u201d name is a play on the Nazis\u2019 \u201cnational socialist\u201d title. A subsection of the modern neo-Nazi movement is also heavily invested in Satanism.\n\nGab, a smaller site than Twitter, has nevertheless attracted an outsized concentration of white supremacists, due to its tolerance for racism. The site has been linked with a number of crimes, including to the murder of 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue last year.\n\n\u201cThis account was banned as soon as it was brought to our attention,\u201d Gab told The Daily Beast. \u201cGab has zero tolerance for illegal conduct of any kind. We communicated and fully cooperated directly with federal law enforcement, as required by law, to identify this individual and bring them to justice. As this is an ongoing investigation we have no further comment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, an archive of one of Gilreath\u2019s several now-deleted Twitter accounts reveals a virulently anti-Semitic web presence, where he shared content from the leader of a now-defunct white supremacist terror ring. Now-deleted tweets indicate he was highly active on the platform, trying to network with other white supremacists and argue with anti-fascist Satanists. He appears to have operated multiple similarly-named Twitter accounts at different times, which suggests he was repeatedly banned and returned to the site under new pseudonyms (a common tactic for extremists on the site).\n\nIn May, Twitter users indicated they\u2019d reported one of his now-suspended accounts for pedophilia. Indeed, Gilreath was already on federal authorities\u2019 radar. In January, the FBI looked into him after he posted a \u201chunting guide\u201d with addresses for mosques and synagogues, according to a criminal complaint. He was interviewed by the FBI that month but released.\n\nGilreath also tried to buy a gun in May, but was denied after failing a background check due to being ruled as \u201cmental defective or committed to a mental institution\u201d three years earlier, according to the criminal complaint. (\u201cYou\u2019ve permanently ruined my ability to buy a gun in CO and other states,\u201d his father texted him after the failed purchase, court documents show.)\n\nBut it would take an accident for authorities to arrest Gilreath. In May, Gilreath allegedly left his iPhone on a public bus. A bus driver found the device unlocked and opened to images of child pornography. When bus employees notified police, investigators were able to match the device to Gilreath, due in part to text messages referencing his interview with the FBI.\n\nThe recent search warrants for Gilreath\u2019s Gab and Twitter activity indicate that authorities aren\u2019t finished digging in to his internet activity.", "description": "The 29-year-old Colorado man first wound up on the feds\u2019 radar for his anti-Semitic \u201chunting guides.\u201d Now investigators want to know if he shared child porn on the platforms.", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571278459/191017-weill-colorado-criminal-tease_ibbc6w", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
