Here's POLITICO's guide to the nominees, whose portfolios will be announced on Tuesday.\n\nAll will need approval from the European Parliament before they can take up their posts \u2014 except von der Leyen, who won confirmation from MEPs in July.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen (Germany), president\n\n\n\nWill be the first female Commission president.

Former Danish Cabinet minister and main inspiration for the TV series \u201cBorgen.\u201d Known in Denmark for being a tough-minded, kickass finance minister. Knits small elephants to release post-College of Commissioners tension. Speaks French to express enthusiasm (\u201cMais c\u2019est magnifique la Vivatech!\u201d she told French radio in reference to the annual worldwide gathering of startups in Paris).\n\nAustria \u2014 Johannes Hahn\n\n\n\nFormer minister for science accused of plagiarizing his Ph.D. (what does he think he is, German?) but allowed to keep his doctorate after an inquiry.
