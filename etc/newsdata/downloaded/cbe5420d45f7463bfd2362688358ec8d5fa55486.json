The number of forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon so far this year surged by 84% from the same period in 2018.", "description": "The U.S. did not agree to the G-7's $22 million fund to help control fires in the Amazon rainforest, a White House official has claimed.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106097108-1566834881642rts2nybm.jpg?v=1567085840"}
