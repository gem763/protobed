It was also a symbol of the struggle within this White House to manage and fight back against Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, all while facing deep criticism from fellow Republicans over the administration\u2019s handling of Syria and the G-7 venue. During the past week, White House aides have felt under siege. One former administration official called it one of the White House\u2019s worst weeks during Trump\u2019s presidency, and aides and allies started to contemplate the length of Mulvaney\u2019s tenure in the West Wing.\n\nIn recent months, Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, has grown fed up with Mulvaney at various points and has spoken poorly of his laissez-faire management style, one Republican close to the White House said. At first, Kushner was quite pleased with Mulvaney\u2019s hands-off approach because of its departure from the tense reign of Gen. John Kelly, Mulvaney\u2019s immediate predecessor, and because it allowed Kushner to operate freely. Yet that sentiment has waned in recent months, the Republican said, as the White House has started to feel more chaotic.\n\nA senior administration official said Kushner is supportive of Mulvaney as the acting chief of staff and that when there have been complications in the White House, Mulvaney and Kushner have a close enough relationship to \u201chash it out.\u201d\n\nThe White House press office declined to comment on the record Sunday. Later, it did not respond when asked whether White House aides or allies were drawing up lists for Mulvaney\u2019s replacement.\n\nOn ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos,\" former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a longtime friend of the president\u2019s, called Trump\u2019s since-reversed decision to hold the G-7 at Doral an \u201cunforced error\u201d and Mulvaney\u2019s Thursday briefing \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\nRahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to President Barack Obama and a former mayor of Chicago, had his own advice for Mulvaney on the same program: \u201cGet yourself a lawyer, and do it fast.\u201d\n\nChristie added: \u201cI\u2019ve said this to the president as recently as this week. We have to be in friend-making mode. OK? There\u2019s a time to be combative and there\u2019s a time to be in friend-making mode, vis-\u00e0-vis your own party. And right now, when you\u2019re facing impeachment \u2014 which by the way, is predetermined, as I\u2019ve said before.\u201d\n\nMulvaney tried to help on that front by hosting Republican lawmakers at Camp David over the weekend.\n\nHe appeared on TV twice this past week to publicly defend the president at a time when few other top officials are willing to go on-air, and he agreed on Thursday to go on camera to deliver the news that the president was intending to hold the G-7 at one of his resorts, even though several White House officials, from lawyers to advance staff to operations aides, were looped in on the decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that if we had made the decision [on Doral] on Thursday, we would not have had the press conference on Thursday regarding everything else. That is fine,\u201d Mulvaney told Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nAnother senior administration official said some White House aides had been frustrated by the media\u2019s reaction to Mulvaney\u2019s appearances, but that Mulvaney himself was still focused on his job and fighting for the president.\n\nSeveral White House aides and Trump allies presume Mulvaney\u2019s job is safe during the impeachment proceedings. That\u2019s in part, they say, because no one else would want the chief of staff job right now and partly because Mulvaney is too much at the center of the Ukraine scandal for Trump to unceremoniously dump him as he has done with other senior aides like John Bolton, his former national security adviser.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5e/f2/2b5dc6a7428e9328ec0ea03ddf89/20191020-mick-mulvaney-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
