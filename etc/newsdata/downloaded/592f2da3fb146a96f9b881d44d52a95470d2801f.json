Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.] four years ago. There were a lot of us saying, 'What are we getting here?'\" he said. \"Fast forward a little farther and by the fall the single biggest issue that brought nine out of 10 Republican voters home to Donald Trump, just like nine out of 10 voted for Mitt Romney, was the Supreme Court.\"\n\nWhile only a quarter of the names on the Demand Justice list have experience as judges, many have argued cases before the Supreme Court or clerked for high court justices. The list does not include any current or former corporate lawyers, which the progressive organization says was intentional.\n\n\"Instead, our list boasts a wide range of former public defenders, public interest lawyers, academics, and plaintiff\u2019s lawyers,\" it says.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMany of the names on the Demand Justice list have experience with progressive groups, like Nicole Berner, general counsel to the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Dale Ho, director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project.\n\nThe group also notes that McConnell's removal of the 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court justices -- a move he made after Democrats chose to filibuster nominee Neil Gorsuch -- will allow Democrats to push through more progressive jurists with only 50 votes.\n\n\"In the past, Democratic presidents were bound by the need for 60 votes, leading them to look for \u201csafer\u201d picks who could draw Republican support,\" the statement reads. \"If Democrats win back the Senate and are able to confirm a pick with just a simple majority, there is all the less reason to confine ourselves to those more traditional types of nominees.\"\n\nNotably absent from the list is Merrick Garland, a moderately liberal judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by former President Barack Obama in 2016 in hopes that he could draw enough votes from the GOP-controlled Senate to be confirmed before the presidential election that year. He never received a confirmation vote in the Senate.", "description": "Demand Justice cites the effect Trump's 2016 list had of rallying the conservative base behind the GOP nominee as a reason why Democrats should follow suit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/07/694940094001_6092831138001_6092836252001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
