The inquiry found that both of them were \"not fit and proper to hold their respective offices\", according to a statement from the Presidency.\n\nMeanwhile, Parliament's process to consider Ramaphosa's decision has been put on ice until, at the earliest, September 19, News24 previously reported.\n\nThe parties involved in Jiba's urgent application for an interdict to halt the process agreed to an order that suspends it until September 19, when the first part of Jiba's application will be heard.\n\nOn Monday morning, Nxasana also took the state capture commission through the settlement amount he received from former president Jacob Zuma to vacate office. He said he did not \"put any barrel of a gun to anyone to pay me that money\".\n\nIn 2015, Nxasana received the R17m golden handshake when he left office. After tax, he received R10m, News24 previously reported.\n\nHe added that he never said, at any stage, that he wanted to step down from his position.\n\nNxasana said at the time, former Minister of Justice Jeff Radebe raised the issue that he should step down.\n\nThe former NDPP told the commission that he insisted, both at a meeting and in a letter to Radebe, that he would not resign as he believed he was fit to hold office.\n\nHe said Zuma later asked him to resign, adding that the former president's attorney at the time, Michael Hulley, also expressed Zuma's unhappiness with him.\n\n\"I was literally fired with no fault [on] my part,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he paid back the amount which the Constitutional Court ordered him to pay in August 2018, Nxasana said he hadn't.\n\n\"Because I don't have it,\" he added.", "description": "Former National Director of Public Prosecutions Mxolisi Nxasana has told the state capture commission of inquiry that a failure to act against senior prosecutors Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi, who have since been fired, harmed the National Prosecuting Authority.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8471/bd2f0047d6cd4676b0943f70358fd340.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
