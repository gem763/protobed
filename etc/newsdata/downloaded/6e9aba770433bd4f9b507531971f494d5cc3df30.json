Where did it come from? And why is it experiencing a resurgence today?\n\nGaslighting takes its name from the 1944 film Gaslight, starring Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer (itself based on the 1938 play Gas Light). In the film, Paula (Bergman) is deliberately and gradually manipulated by her husband, Gregory (Boyer), into believing she is insane. Paula\u2019s late aunt\u2019s priceless jewels are hidden in their house: if Paula is declared insane and committed to an asylum, Gregory can search for the jewels in peace.\n\nIngrid Bergman and Charles Boyer in Gaslight (1944), the film that inspired the now widely used term. Image: Metro Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nOne of his main tactics in convincing Paula she is losing her mind is his manipulation of the gaslights in their home. Whenever he sneaks off to the attic to search for the jewels, he switches on the lights in that part of the house: this leads all other lights to flicker and dim. Upon returning to Paula, he denies all knowledge of this, leading her to question her sanity.\n\nIn the film\u2019s final scenes, Paula allows a policeman to enter the house while Gregory is preoccupied with his search. The policeman confirms that the lights are flickering, demonstrating that Paula is not insane.\n\nWhat does gaslighting look like?\n\nGaslighting is a new term for a relatively old set of behaviours. If you\u2019ve read the ancient Greek myth of Cassandra (about a woman cursed to foresee true prophecies that others disbelieve due to her perceived mental instability), watched The Truman Show, or listened to Shaggy\u2019s hit song, It Wasn\u2019t Me (in which a man tells his girlfriend it wasn\u2019t him she saw having sex with another woman), you\u2019ve seen gaslighting in action.\n\nAlthough it can cover various behaviours, the central tenet of gaslighting is the psychological manipulation of a person in order to erode their sense of self and sanity.\n\nThe behaviour itself is not always deliberate, in that the perpetrator may not have consciously set out to distort another person\u2019s experience of reality. But gaslighting is often used as a method of power and control.\n\nCommon gaslighting tactics can include denial of the gaslightee\u2019s experience (\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what happened!\u201d), escalation (\u201cWhy would you question this? I wouldn\u2019t lie to you!\u201d), trivialisation (\u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive, this is nothing\u201d), and countering (\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what happened, this was\u201d).\n\nWhy now?\n\nGaslighting\u2019s re-emergence in our day-to-day vernacular is in part due to a wider societal focus on violence against women. As we move towards a broader understanding of what constitutes abuse, there is growing recognition that psychologically abusive techniques such as gaslighting are often used to unnerve and demoralise others.\n\nGaslighting is increasingly being recognised as a technique of abuse by groups such as the Domestic Violence Resource Centre of Victoria and Safe Steps.\n\nThe term also rebuts a common set of stereotypes: the \u201ccrazy ex-girlfriend\u201d, the \u201cbitches be crazy\u201d or \u201cpsycho bitch\u201d refrain and the \u201chysterical woman\u201d. Gaslighting reframes these cliches: instead of asking whether women are indeed crazy, it questions the motivations of the accuser.\n\nUnfortunately, gaslighting has also been used to dismiss those who have employed #MeToo to speak out about their abuse. Comments directed to survivors that they must have \u201cmisread the situation\u201d or \u201cimagined the abuse\u201d can in turn point to wider questions about a person\u2019s sanity.\n\nGaslighting\u2019s application in the public lexicon has become quite broad. For instance, many news articles have been written about Donald Trump\u2019s so-called gaslighting behaviour towards the American public, in which he has tried to manipulate people into \u201cdoubting their reality\u201d.\n\nDonald Trump: various pundits have described his statements as a form of \u2018gaslighting\u2019. Shawn Thew/EPA\n\nIn a recent speech, for example, Trump criticised the media for its reaction to his trade tariffs policy, accusing it of broadcasting \u201cfake news\u201d and telling people, \u201cwhat you are seeing and what you are reading is not what\u2019s happening\u201d.\n\nBut in describing Trump\u2019s behaviour as gaslighting, we lose some of the word\u2019s context: it was developed to describe behaviour altogether more intimate and controlling in nature, and difficult to escape.\n\nStill, aside from the latter example, the growing usage of \u201cgaslighting\u201d as a term is broadly a good thing. It signifies a deeper understanding of what abuse looks like and the many forms it can take.\n\nJessamy Gleeson, Research Officer, School of Global, Urban & Social Studies, RMIT University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.", "description": "Shortlisted for Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s 2018 word of the year, \u201cgaslighting\u201d has well and truly found its way into contemporary thought and vernacular....", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Jackson Bison", "Nuka Girl"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2014/12/OnlineAbuse.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
