Since launching in May, Xandr has signed deals that allow AT&T to sell some advertising from external publishers like Hearst Magazines, Cheddar, A+ E Networks, and Vice. Xandr also sells advertising space on streaming video apps Tubi, Xumo, and Philo.\n\nAdvertisers use Community to balance their investments between TV and digital. For example, AT&T's trove of data can identify \"light TV viewers.\" Advertisers say they've used Xandr to find TV-like audiences online to hit their reach and frequency goals.\n\nRead more: Some marketers say AT&T's big plan to reinvent advertising is taking shape but worry that it will shut out competitors\n\n\"Our mission is to build a platform to help other companies monetize inventory,\" said Brian Lesser, CEO of Xandr in a statement.\n\nXandr announced its deals with Bloomberg and Vudu at its Relevance Conference in Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\nMarketers are skeptical that AT&T can work across the industry\n\nSome marketers say it's unclear how much data and proprietary technology the telecom giant will share, however.\n\nAT&T is also competing with similar technology that networks are developing, such as Open A.P., a joint venture with NBCUniversal, Fox Corp. and Viacom.
