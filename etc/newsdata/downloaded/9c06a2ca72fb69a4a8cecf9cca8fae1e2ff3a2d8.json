As usual, the Fed overtightened policy and the economy turned down and now rate cuts are back. The Fed still - mistakenly - considers this a mid-cycle adjustment.\n\nGood luck with that. We think the path to zero US rates is now unavoidable.\n\nAt home, Australian rates are now close to zero and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Philip Lowe, who has recently seen the light, has been vocal in the lower-for-longer message.\n\nBe careful what you wish for, as the curse of rate cuts is that they boost asset prices and debt levels, as is happening here, making the impact of any future rate rises higher than ever and almost guaranteeing they would be very modest.\n\nEven as central bankers slash rates they profoundly fail to influence the one thing they care about most: inflation expectations.\n\nThis failure is crushing for them and highlights their impotence. As such, they fear further moves on their part will be useless and attention globally has shifted to fiscal policy which is now expected to do the heavy lifting. However, with parts of Europe and Australia still obsessed with fiscal austerity it could take a crisis to get things moving meaningfully, and by then it could be too late.\n\nBut there is no doubt the first part of the coming decade will see traditional fiscal stimulus return to the table. Investors will also need to consider, whether like monetary policy, we eventually see unconventional fiscal policy emerge after more traditional measures are exhausted through excessive debt build-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is unconventional fiscal policy? For this we prefer the idea of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which is slowly and rightfully emerging from the fringe. Through the MMT lens the government itself, not the central bank, controls the economy through fiscal injections (largely infrastructure and employment-based) until spare capacity is exhausted.\n\nThe government would pay for these projects and jobs through printing money. In this model interest rates are irrelevant and set to zero. Inflation is managed by the fact that when resource limits are reached, the fiscal pulse is wound down or even reversed until the inflation problem subsides. Crucially, MMT breaks the two \"holy\" links between taxes and spending and spending and deficits.\n\nWe are clearly at the point where the age of the central bankers as rock stars and the saviours of the world is over.\n\nIf monetary policy is now ineffective, as the data suggests, why do we need central banks at all? The birth of a new era of fiscal policy will soon be upon us, and unelected central bankers will retreat to the cosy of halls of academia. It won\u2019t be an easy transition but it is coming and investors need to think about what it would mean for inflation and volatility and their impact on asset values. Vive la r\u00e9volution.\n\nVimal Gor is Head of Bond, Income and Defensive Strategies at Pendal Group", "description": "The birth of a new era of fiscal policy will soon be upon us, leaving no place for unelected central bankers and their ineffective interest rate policies, writes Vimal Gor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3606%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_299%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/87ecff05a638562cf0515b30abc74f44d08d5d7b", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
