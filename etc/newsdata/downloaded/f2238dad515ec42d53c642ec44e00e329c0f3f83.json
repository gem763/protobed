One day's coverage is no longer tomorrow's chip-paper.'\n\nHarry added: 'My deepest fear is history repeating itself. I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.\n\n'I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.'\n\nThe Duke of Sussex added he has been 'witness to her private suffering for too long' and 'to stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in'.\n\nDuring Harry's visit to the clinic in Malawi, he sat down for a private chat with the teenagers, after learning about the work of medical staff and other employees at the clinic.\n\nSitting outside but under cover from the searing sun, the discussion was supposed to be about sexual health but also touched on other topics the duke is passionate about, including climate change and conservation.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex added he has been 'witness to her private suffering for too long' and 'to stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in'\n\nA health official said: 'They asked him what challenges he faced when growing up and he did have challenges but he said they were not similar as the context was different.\n\n'He told the young people to 'hold on to your dreams' and he urged them to show kindness, empathy and work together.'\n\nHarry had travelled to the village of Blantyre to see an innovative project funded by the US and UK Governments which is ensuring that vaccines, drugs and other treatments are more readily available.\n\nThe duke embarked on a ten-day tour of southern Africa with wife Meghan and their son Archie.", "description": "Prince Harry has filed papers at the High Court against News Group Newspapers - which owns The Sun - and MGN Limited - which owns The Mirror - on September 27, court records show.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19312792-0-image-a-6_1570217962805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
