You have to love Owen Farrell. He sums up this England team', said Woodward.\n\n'No real celebration because they know they have one big game to come. Itoje was just fantastic, so many heroes in this team but Farrell and Itoje were immense.\n\n'They strangled the All Blacks the whole game. Huge win for England and totally deserved. No one can say the better team didn't win.'\n\nWilkinson had similar acclaim for England's players, saying the performance was the result of hard-work and the environment head coach Jones has created in the camp.\n\n'Second by second they did exactly what was needed, responded to each other's calls for extra effort and looked immensely complete,' said Wilkinson.\n\n'Defensively they were rushing up, stopping New Zealand's width. They gave very little away and in attack they looked sure, powerful, explosive and it is a great sign of what is to come.\n\n'You have to give our boys enormous credit. This is a result of immense training and talent.\n\nEngland stunned New Zealand with a 19-7 victory to reach the Rugby World Cup final in Japan\n\n'Eddie Jones has created an environment that has put this team on a level with these superheroes (New Zealand) we've seen dominating for years.'\n\nSean Fitzpatrick, a 1987 World Cup winner with New Zealand, had no disagreements and admitted the better team won in Yokohama.\n\n'Take my hat off to England. What a performance. That execution, how precise they were, their variety of attack and their defence was tremendous, said Fitzpatrick.\n\n'All Blacks didn't get in the game. England were dominant with the ball and full of energy off it. Game plan executed to perfection.'\n\nEngland will have to wait till Sunday to find out who stands in the way of their second Rugby World Cup triumph, with Wales and South Africa going head-to-head in the tournament's other semi-final.", "description": "Television pundits Sir Clive Woodward and Jonny Wilkinson were full of praise for England's 'heroes' after they produced a stunning performance to beat New Zealand.", "authors": ["Cian Cheesbrough For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/12/20214086-0-image-a-22_1572088300089.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
