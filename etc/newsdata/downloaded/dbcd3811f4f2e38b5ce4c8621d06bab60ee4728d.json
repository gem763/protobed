REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nTurkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies pushed further into Syrian territory on Thursday, opening up a new front in the eight-year-old Syrian civil war, and exposing Europe\u2019s powerlessness and inability to influence the direction of the conflict.\n\nThe assault, which began after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled American troops out of the way, also raises fundamental questions over the fate of EU-Turkey ties and further strains transatlantic relations, including trust within the NATO military alliance, diplomats and officials said.\n\nIt complicates further any prospect of Ankara joining the European Union and threatens a migration deal between Brussels and Ankara that has slashed refugee numbers entering the bloc but which was under renewed pressure by new refugees trying to reach Europe.\n\n\u201cThis is a recipe for disaster, be it for the Turks, the Kurds or us,\u201d said a senior European diplomat. \u201cThis Turkish intervention is a complete distraction that will open up a Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d\n\nAnkara has said it intends to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d to return millions of refugees to Syrian soil, for which it wants Europe to pay, a plan European diplomats have said is unrealistic.\n\nAll 28 EU governments on Wednesday rejected those plans, saying it would not provide aid and warned that such an idea would not past muster with the United Nations.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was blunt, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t expect the EU to pay for any of it.\u201d\n\nPUT EUROPE\u2019S HOUSE IN ORDER\n\nBut how much Europe can do to pressure Ankara is unclear. It relies on Turkey to curb the arrival of refugees into Europe following a 2016 agreement to seal off the Aegean route after more than 1 million people entered the bloc.\n\nThose numbers have picked up and coincide with Turkey, which hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, threatening to \u201copen the gates\u201d to allow those already in the country to head for Europe unless it receives support for its plans.\n\n\u201cWe have put ourselves in a position where the Turkish-EU relationship is one-dimensional, based on one topic that has created a balance of power that disfavors us,\u201d said a European diplomat of the 2016 migration deal.\n\n\u201cWe need to put our house in order. There hasn\u2019t been a collective solution to the refugee problem so we find ourselves exposed to this blackmail.\u201d\n\nAt a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, NATO envoys expressed alarm at Turkey\u2019s plans and sought to pressure Erdogan not to go ahead with any operation, diplomats said.\n\nHowever, there was also recognition in the alliance that there was nothing it could do to stop Turkey because NATO is not active in Syria and there was no demand for a NATO role.\n\nISLAMIC STATE RETURN\n\nEven more pressing for Europe is the fate of its Kurdish ally and a potential resurgence of Islamic State militants, which the Europeans are especially sensitive to after several major deadly attacks in the bloc.\n\nBoth French and British special forces operate with the Kurds in the region and their militaries provide air support and training for Kurdish forces, who until the Turkish offensive continued operations hunting down existing Islamic State cells.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to pull back, while not unexpected, has left those two nations particularly exposed. French and British officials acknowledge that if the United States were to fully withdraw they would have no choice but to also draw back.\n\n\u201cBetraying the Kurds would be morally awful but let\u2019s not fool ourselves: with or without Allied forces in northern Syria, the U.S. and Europe don\u2019t have any identifiable and credible policy to ending the Syrian civil war,\u201d France\u2019s former envoy to Washington, Gerard Araud, said on Twitter.\n\nEurope\u2019s immediate fears center on militants regrouping, but also the threat of thousands of foreign fighters held by the Kurds escaping prisons.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe reaction from Trump - who has previously pressed reluctant European nations to take back their nationals among the Islamic State fighters captured on the battlefield in Syria - has done nothing to placate his allies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be escaping to Europe, that\u2019s where they want to go. They want to go back to their homes but Europe didn\u2019t want them,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek summed up European frustration, saying \u201cunfortunately, at this point we have no other possibility than diplomatic pressure in order to calm the situation\u201d.", "description": "Turkey's offensive on Kurdish-led forces in Syria has left its European allies incensed and fearing new jihadist militancy, but they are scrambling to form a coherent response beyond refusing to pay for any new humanitarian crisis on their doorstep.", "authors": ["John Irish", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439290965&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991E3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
