While the comedian recovers from emergency back surgery following a car crash early Sunday morning, he\u2019s facing new criticism over comments made in the season premiere of HBO\u2019s The Shop, which aired Tuesday night.\n\nA clip from the show sees Hart joining in on a discussion in which fellow guest Lil Nas X is asked about his decision to publicly come out as gay in June amid the meteoric success of his hit song \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d Hart, who stepped down as host of this year\u2019s Oscars following uproar over his past homophobic jokes, couldn\u2019t resist interjecting as the rapper shared his story.\n\n\u201cAnd with all that early success, you felt it was important to make an announcement recently?\u201d series creator Paul Rivera asks the 20-year-old musician.\n\nView photos Kevin Hart's reaction to Lil Nas X's coming out story has been criticized. (Photo: Roy Rochlin/Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cHe said he was gay, so what?\u201d Hart interrupts, while others in the room can be heard adding, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\nBut Rivera shuts down the commentary and again presses Lil Nas X on why he felt it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to be open about his sexuality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s like being forced,\u201d he responds. \u201cIt\u2019s just, like, knowing that growing up ... like, I\u2019m grown up to hate that s***, I\u2019m not supposed to ... \u201c\n\nHart cuts him off, asking, \u201chate what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHomosexuality, gay people,\u201d Lil Nas X answers, sounding increasingly frustrated.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Hart fires back.\n\n\u201cCome on now,\u201d Lil Nas X tells him. \u201cIf you really from the hood, you know. It\u2019s not something [accepted] ... \u201c\n\nHe goes on to explain that, by coming out at his height as a \u201ccool dude\u201d with a hit song, it made more impact.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing this while you\u2019re at the top, you know it\u2019s, like, for real,\u201d he says. It\u2019s, like, showing it doesn\u2019t really matter, I guess.\u201d\n\nView photos Lil Nas X came out as gay in June. (Photo: REUTERS/Andrew Kelly) More\n\nNow that the show has aired, Lil Nas X\u2019s statements have been praised, with fans thanking him for using his platform to help pave the way for other LGBTQ individuals. By contrast, Hart\u2019s dismissive reactions have sparked backlash from critics who accuse the star of not taking the matter seriously and sweeping genuine concerns about homophobia under the rug.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna mince words ... f*** Kevin Hart,\u201d read a comment. \u201cHe\u2019s the last person to question anyone\u2019s coming out process and timing. And say this to the young man\u2019s face like that? That\u2019s a no from me.\u201d\n\nLil Nas X is a gift. He continues to be courageous and wise. But putting him in a situation to be gaslit by known homophobes about his choice to come out is terrible. pic.twitter.com/AAsGSlzmb0 \u2014 Frederick Joseph (@FredTJoseph) September 4, 2019\n\n\"He said he was gay. So what!\" Kevin Hart knows exactly what the \"so what\" is here and why a young black boy would closet his sexuality until he believed it was safe. Why not simply listen, give @LilNasX the space and deference to tell his own story... https://t.co/8nY9cHPftP \u2014 G O L D I E. (@goldietaylor) September 4, 2019\n\nOh, Kevin....No. I'd like to think he meant, \"We're OK with you being gay. It's no big deal.\" But you're right, he knows exactly why this is an issue. Kevin, of all people....Come on! I love his comedy, but he just doesn't learn any lessons. \u2014 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf0aKristine (@KrisL1026) September 4, 2019", "description": "Hart, whose past homophobic jokes resulted in him stepping down as Oscars host, grilled the gay rapper in an episode of HBO's \"The Shop.\"", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y3ru.D.hEGwYgVxY__D8bw--~B/aD0zNDYwO3c9NTIwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/67465c00-ccfc-11e9-8c5f-8dcaa73c46ca"}
