And I think there's been a lot of talk about that in the last couple years, but I think we have yet to see substantive change,\" he told our CBC Ottawa colleagues this week before a performance at the National Arts Centre.\n\nBut Cecelia Brooks sees the relationship in a more positive light.\n\n\"I see people are much more open now. I think that when people don't know something about a subject, whatever it might be, nobody wants to be the first one to say, 'Hey, I don't know anything.' And so now that the can's been open, everybody's rushing forward saying,'I want to learn more,'\" she told The House.\n\n\"I know that when change comes to any society, it happens at the grassroots level. That's where it begins.\"\n\n\n\nClimate change a motivating issue for young voters\n\nHundreds of thousands of Canadians on Friday took to the streets to rally for action on climate change, including Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, who joined a march in Montreal after meeting earlier in the day with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThunberg, 16, is considered the original climate striker after she began last year to hold weekly protests to demand more action from her government on climate change.\n\nHer movement has inspired young people all across Canada, including Daniel Nunes, a fourth-year environmental management student at the University of New Brunswick.\n\nHe has helped organize three climate strikes in Fredericton and he has a message for politicians everywhere.\n\n\"I think you need to be concrete in your answers. I think the time for platitudes and very general sweeping statements about what you're going to do about climate change is over. I think we've reached a point where you have to have a plan,\" he told The House.", "description": "This special edition of The House from New Brunswick tackles the economy, cost of living, immigration and Indigenous reconciliation.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294261.1569263709!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ndp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
