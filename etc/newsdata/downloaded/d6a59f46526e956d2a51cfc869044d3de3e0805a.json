Peter Navarro, President Donald Trump\u2019s top advisor and trade negotiator, says the U.S. won\u2019t back down from its demands in the previously failed deal, suggesting roadblocks remain for the two countries to make a pact.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Final Round on Yahoo Finance, Navarro made clear the U.S.\u2019s expectations for the latest round of trade talks.\n\n\u201cWe had a deal. We had a 150 page plus agreement that was in these seven verticals that dealt with each of these issues plus enforcement. It was negotiated over 11 negotiating sessions and including commas and paragraphs. And that's the basis for moving forward,\u201d Navarro said on Friday, referring to the tentative trade deal in May. \u201cBut the Chinese walked away from that. And in many ways, this deal will be determined by what the Chinese want to do.\u201d\n\nPeter Navarro, director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, prepares to board Air Force One with US President Donald Trump prior to departure from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.

Trump has accused China of reneging on its promises last minute. But China denied doing so, saying \u201cnothing is agreed until everything is agreed on.\u201d The Chinese side sees it as a prerequisite for a trade deal that the U.S. remove all additional tariffs imposed on Chinese exports. It also doesn\u2019t want to make changes to its law under the pressure of a foreign power, asking the U.S. to respect its sovereignty and dignity,\n\nSince the fallout of a much-anticipated deal in May, the tension between Washington and Beijing has escalated sharply. Trump has doubled down on his tariffs, expanding additional tariffs on all imported goods from China. The Chinese side hit back with their own tariffs on part of U.S. products, which is seen as \u201cmeasured responses\u201d by experts.\n\nLike Trump, Navarro said the Chinese are paying \u201cthe full burden\u201d of these tariffs because Chinese exporters have lowered the price and China\u2019s currency has devalued by 15%. Despite the ease brought by yuan\u2019s devaluation, hundreds of American companies wrote to the president, urging him to cancel proposed higher tariffs on Chinese imports, which will bring higher costs and price increases.\n\n\u2018The seven deadly sins\u2019\n\nNavarro, one of Washington's most prominent China hawks, listed what he called \u201cthe seven deadly sins\u201d of China, including cyberattacks, forced technology transfer, intellectual property theft, product dumping, subsidized state-owned enterprises, currency manipulation and selling fentanyl to the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe need to go back to that original deal, those seven verticals, dealing completely with all of those structural issues,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cIn the two and a half years the president's been in office, he has changed this country's understanding of the China problem. And right now he has very strong bipartisan support and public support for standing up to China.\u201d\n\nKrystal Hu covers technology and China for Yahoo Finance.
