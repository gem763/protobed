The weekly gatherings to watch games with his friends had all but stopped over the past few years as losses piled up. The 29-year-old New York resident had gradually been paying less attention.\n\nBut something funny happened over the weekend as he watched Daniel Jones lead an 18-point comeback against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers \u2014 he felt hope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like (my fandom has) been rejuvenated,\u201d Somerstein said.\n\nSomerstein and his friends now plan to meet Sunday at one of their apartments when the Giants take on the Redskins because of their excitement for Jones. In just one start, the rookie quarterback has galvanized New York\u2019s fan base. The New York Post even re-created Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cHOPE\u201d campaign poster, using Jones\u2018 image on the back page of Tuesday\u2019s paper this week.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest reminder of how a young quarterback can re-energize a fan base, and draws as a stark contrast to the Redskins\u2019 handling of Dwayne Haskins. Despite calls for the rookie to start in New York, coach Jay Gruden is sticking by quarterback Case Keenum in light of his five-turnover performance in Monday\u2019s loss to the Chicago Bears.\n\nEven with an 0-3 start, Gruden has said the season is not lost and wants to see Keenum get continuity with the offense.\n\nKeenum missed practice Wednesday with a foot injury, but Gruden said he assumes the 31-year-old will play against New York.\n\n\u201cDwayne is on pace,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe just needs to continue to sit back and learn and continue to develop.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins had preached patience when they drafted Haskins 15th overall out of Ohio State. Yet after three straight losses, cries to play for the quarterback have gotten loud. In recent days, Gruden has received criticism for his handling of Haskins as the rookie has only received scout team reps in practice.\n\nBut Gruden\u2019s approach isn\u2019t out of the ordinary.\n\nBefore Jones started in Week 3, Giants coach Pat Shurmur said Eli Manning took the lion\u2019s share of work, designating only one or two reps for Jones in each practice period.\n\nJones and Haskins, too, both worked off to the side during their practices to get additional work.\n\n\u201cEach coach handles it differently,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s fair to say \u2014 and Jay does a great job with quarterbacks. I think he would agree with me that you\u2019re doing everything you can in your power to develop all the players all the time. There\u2019s constant development when it comes to quarterbacks.\u201d\n\nIronically, Giants fans were adamantly against Jones\u2018 selection in April. When New York took him with the sixth overall pick, Somerstein and his friends were \u201cfreaking out\u201d in a group text with each other. The pick was mocked around the league.\n\nThe tone changed when Jones threw for 336 yards and scored four touchdowns (two passing, two rushing) in his first start \u2014 earning him NFC offensive player of the week honors.\n\nSuddenly, the outlook is different for a team that went 8-24 over the last two seasons. Jones may not solve all of New York\u2019s problems, but having a potential franchise quarterback goes a long way in fixing them.\n\nThe Redskins, meanwhile, think they have the same in Haskins. But he\u2019ll have to wait, for now.\n\n\u201cDwayne is still coming along,\u201d Gruden said on a conference call with New York media. \u201cHe\u2019s young and I think it\u2019s important for him to sit back and see how to prepare as a pro. He\u2019ll get his time, he\u2019ll get his chance. Just not yet.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
