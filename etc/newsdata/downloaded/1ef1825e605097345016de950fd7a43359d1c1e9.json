The results of the survey were revealed at the Association of the US Army conference in Washington, DC, on Monday.\n\nOver 60% of respondents in the survey said DOD needed to actively take steps to develop and field secure connectivity capabilities that could withstand cyberattacks and denial-of-service attempts, types of asymmetric warfare being employed by low-end threats and near-peer adversaries alike.\n\nThe problem for the US military is that the acquisitions process that served the US well for decades, allowing the military to produce some of the finest systems in the world, can no longer keep pace with the speed of development in the private sector.\n\nSeventy percent of those surveyed said a new acquisition process was necessary for speed of relevance development.\n\nThe industry side argues that rather than try to reinvent the wheel for military purposes, the DOD should instead make use of commercial solutions. Fifty-nine percent of DOD respondents agreed, with only 10% in disagreement.\n\nAs far as what the military wants, possibly from the industry, 60% of respondents said that cloud-enabled technologies would be an important tool for military decision-making going forward, and 81% agreed that the US military needs a modern end-to-end satellite and ground-based network to achieve desired results.\n\nWhile many of the problems with US military communications and connectivity capabilities were previously known, the survey is intended to serve as a wake-up call. This survey, Daniel Thomas, the director of the Government Business Council said in a statement, \"is a clarion call to military leadership across the board.\"", "description": "More than half of the Defense Department officials surveyed said they lack the connectivity they need to effectively achieve their mission objectives.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da1d445cc4a0a0469765403?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
