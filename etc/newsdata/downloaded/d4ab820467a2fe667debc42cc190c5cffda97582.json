Mom to Silence Her After She Was 'Witness to a Crime'", "language": "en", "text": "Days after finding the apparent remains of a California mom missing for nearly two months, authorities allege her husband killed her because she was a \u201cwitness to a crime\u201d and he wanted to stop her from testifying.\n\nAuthorities did not reveal what alleged crime 33-year-old Heather Gumina had observed, or where or how she was killed, in a document filed in El Dorado County Superior Court and obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nBut the four-page criminal complaint lists multiple felony convictions for the suspect, 44-year-old Anthony Gumina, including those for selling and possessing methamphetamine, and alleges that \u201cHeather Gumina was a witness to a crime and was intentionally killed to prevent her from testifying in a criminal proceeding,\u201d according to the document.\n\nHeather, a mother of three, was killed on or about July 16, according to the document. That\u2019s the same day she was last seen in the Pleasant Valley area following her release from a hospital, where she was treated for a broken collarbone.\n\nRELATED: Remains of Missing Calf.

Even if she seemed a little sad, she did a wonderful job, nobody knew.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had told me some stories of the past about some things that had happened, but you know \u2026 I didn\u2019t notice anything wrong,\u201d says Waldow. \u201cShe was very happy.\u201d\n\nEven after the broken collarbone incident \u2014 Heather told Waldow that she tripped and fell \u2014 \u201cshe just kind of brushed it off,\u201d says Waldow. \u201cShe was joking around about how she might come in and work.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, according to court documents cited by KTXL, Anthony was charged after allegedly head-butting and tackling Heather as she held her 4-year-old son. The documents also alleged he kicked in doors and forcibly took phones from her so she couldn\u2019t call 911.\n\n\u201cI just wish she would have confided in me more,\u201d says Waldow. \u201cSometimes I think people are embarrassed by those kinds of things. \u2026 People need to realize it\u2019s not an embarrassing thing. If you need help, you should say something.\u201d\n\nAfter upgrading the arrest of Anthony to a charge of first-degree homicide, the sheriff\u2019s office has declined to release any other information \u201cto protect the integrity of this homicide investigation,\u201d according to the agency\u2019s statement on social media.\n\nJail records show Anthony is being held without bond in the El Dorado County jail.", "description": "Husband Allegedly Killed Calif.
