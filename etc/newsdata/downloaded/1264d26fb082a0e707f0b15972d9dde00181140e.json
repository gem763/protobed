As Trysta Krick details, Washington is on the brink while the Astros are one game away from a classic comeback. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Really, it\u2019s always been leading to this for Stephen Strasburg.\n\nThe No. 1 pick in the 2009 draft, Strasburg has spent the past decade shouldering the projected hopes and dreams of a city learning to fall in love with baseball.\n\nNow, getting the start in Game 6 of the 2019 World Series with his team down three games to two, the 31-year-old has the chance to fulfill that destiny and put his career on a Hall of Fame trajectory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely uncharted territory,\u201d Strasburg said Sunday in Washington, two days before taking the ball for the most important start of his career.\n\nThis very month seven years ago, Strasburg was at the center of one of the most polarizing roster debates in the history of baseball. Barely two years removed from Tommy John surgery, the Nationals chose to shut down the then-24-year-old and not let him pitch in the 2012 postseason.\n\n\"We'll be back and doing this a couple more times,\" Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said that September.\n\nRivals fumed over the club\u2019s arrogance. The Nationals would lose the NLDS that year in gut-wrenching fashion and then did the same in 2014, 2016 and 2017.\n\nTHE BORAS SERIES: Top free agents on display in World Series \u2013 and they all have same agent\n\nTHE BIG QUESTION: Can Nationals win with small stable of trusted arms?\n\nStrasburg was taken No. 1 overall by the Nationals in 2009. (Photo: Matt Slocum, AP)\n\nAnd with the departure of Bryce Harper \u2013 who was taken first overall the year after Strasburg \u2013 most assumed the title window was closed for the Nationals.\n\nBut Strasburg willed this 2019 team to the postseason and has delivered in the biggest spots this month.\n\nHe has a 4-0 record, 1.93 ERA and 40 strikeouts with just two walks in 28 innings. He got the win out of the bullpen in the wild-card game. In a winner-take-all NLDS Game 5, Strasburg gave up three runs in the first two innings but then held the Dodgers scoreless for the next four innings as the Nationals rallied back to win in extras.\n\n\"I just learned over the years that pressure's a funny thing and I think it's something that you have complete control over,\" Strasburg said earlier this month. \"I really tried over the years to train my mind into thinking that every single game is just as important and just sticking to my approach.\"\n\nAnd this year, he\u2019s ditched all the \u201cinjury-prone\u201d labels that have plagued him since his return from Tommy John surgery in 2011. He\u2019s made 12 trips to the disabled list prior to this season, including at least two stints in each of the past four seasons.\n\nThis was the second time in Strasburg\u2019s career \u2013 and first since 2014 \u2013 with 200 innings in the regular season. By the time the World Series is done, he\u2019ll have pitched more than 240 innings in 2019.\n\n\"I think mechanically I've been able to be a little bit more consistent when I go out there and pitch,\" Strasburg said Sunday. \"Just made some minor tweaks in the offseason training program. I kind of put more emphasis on just strength, not so much endurance, and trying to get my weight up. And I was able to kind of ride that throughout the year.\"\n\nOf course, Tuesday's game bears the elephant in the room \u2013 that it could be Strasburg's last game with the organization that drafted him. He can opt out of the four years and $100 million remaining on his current deal. Considering his 2019 performance, Strasburg could be in line for quite a payday.\n\nBut perhaps even more importantly, Strasburg, who has a career 3.17 ERA in the regular season, can go a long way towards cementing himself as an all-time great.\n\n\"It's kind of what you would expect playing nine, ten years at the highest level,\" Strasburg said during the NLDS. \"You have ups and downs ... just realize that at the end of the day, when it's all done \u2013 how do you want to look back on it?\n\n\"And really, it's going out there and doing everything you can to be the best version of yourself.", "description": "Taken No. 1 overall in 2009, Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg has gone through ups and downs but can cement legacy in Game 6 of the World Series.", "authors": ["Jesse Yomtov", "Published P.M.
