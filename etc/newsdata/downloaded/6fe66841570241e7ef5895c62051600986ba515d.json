A coat that mimicked ancient marbled details was worn over a sheer skirt and belted organza top with a smoky granite pattern.\n\nA Dalmatian fur was later paired with sheer trousers. One black fur coat had architectural lines defined by sheer cut-outs, while another black fur shawl was as soft and enveloping. A laser-cut leather dress was belted prettily at the waist. Evening dresses had sheer bodices with crisscrossing straps over granite-shaded under layers.\n\nModels wore mod 1970s pageboy haircuts, at times coloured to match the looks in soft blue, green or fading shades.\n\nThe looks were accessorized with big hoop earrings and oversized colour-tinted eyewear. Large, soft fur bags were carried under the arm, while small leather pouches hung daintily from long chains.\n\nLagerfeld's death in February brought to a close a 54-year collaboration with Fendi \u2014 the longest in fashion history between a designer and a fashion house.\n\nSilvia Venturini Fendi is the third generation of her family to run the Italian fashion dynasty.", "description": "Italian luxury fashion house Fendi has paid tribute to its former creative director Karl Lagerfeld at its haute couture show in Rome.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/00/29/22/1000x563_cmsv2_22225c28-e4c2-5dd0-99c4-4a99b37e87c3-4002922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-06"}
