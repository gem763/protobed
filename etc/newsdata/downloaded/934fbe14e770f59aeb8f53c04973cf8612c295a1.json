They get it done.\n\nCongress needs to follow our farmers\u2019 example and get the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement done.\n\nUSMCA, improves upon NAFTA, which created a significant and reliable market over the past 25 years for the second-to-none dairy foods produced by our farmers and processors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nConsider the importance of that relationship:\n\nMexico and Canada account for 40 percent of all U.S. dairy exports.\n\nOur No. 1 export market, Mexico, imports $1.4 billion in U.S. dairy products which ultimately supports 25,000 American jobs.\n\nAs the third-largest U.S. dairy importer, Canada takes in $639 million worth of products each year.\n\nTrade is top of mind for farmers throughout the Midwest. Dairy farmers need long-term economic certainty for their businesses, families and employees, and they want it for their rural communities. Trade holds the key. With more opportunities for free and fair trading, we will capture markets that are expanding as the population does.\n\nThis deal is good for our dairy farmers \u2014 no matter farm size or business model. It is good for all of agriculture. It is good for both agribusinesses and non-agricultural businesses. It is good for the economy. USMCA is good for America.\n\nThe agreement will not only prevent dairy farmers and processors from losing ground with our neighbors, but will provide an opportunity to increase our products\u2019 market share. Congress cannot allow the relationships and business infrastructure built over the years with these key partners to crumble.\n\nOur dairy farmers, trying to navigate the turbulent agricultural economy of the past several years, have grown tired of hearing that help is on the way. They want to see it.\n\nAnd as farmers continue to battle extreme weather conditions throughout the Midwest, this is one thing lawmakers can do to ease their minds.\n\nCongress must move swiftly on this agreement. Put the bitter partisanship aside at least long enough to pass this critical legislation.\n\nThe administration has done its job to bring USMCA to this point. It\u2019s now up to Congress to get it done \u2014 quickly.\n\nTim Trotter is the executive director of Edge Dairy Farmer Cooperative, one of the largest dairy cooperatives in the country based on milk volume.
