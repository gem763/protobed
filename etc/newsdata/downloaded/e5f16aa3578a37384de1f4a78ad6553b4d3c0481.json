A lot of emotions,\" Toro told CBC.\n\nThat home run made him something of an overnight star. His name now appears on a T-shirt, inspired by an R-rated quote uttered by Verlander in the immediate aftermath of the no-hitter.\n\nThe thought makes Toro chuckle.\n\nJustin Verlander was searching for Toro during his no-hitter celebration, a moment now immortalized in textile. (breakingt.com)\n\nDrafted by the Astros in the fifth round of the 2016 draft, Toro is a switch-hitting third baseman known for his hitting ability. He was named the Astros' minor league player of the year for 2019.\n\nHe appeared in 25 games at the major league level, posting a .218 batting average with three doubles, two home runs and nine RBI in that time.\n\nIt's not yet clear whether he will play during the post-season. But he will be ready, just in case.\n\n\"Everybody here is pretty good. The expectation of this team is [to] win the World Series,\" he said.\n\n\"Expectations are high, and that makes you want to play better.\"\n\n'I did it. I made it'\n\nToro comes across as a pretty even-keeled guy \u2014 a trait confirmed by his mother, Yamila Hernandez.\n\nShe returned to Montreal from a trip to see him play with his minor league team Aug. 19. The next day, he called her just before midnight. As soon as he said the word \"mom,\" she knew what was coming, she said.\n\n\"He said, 'I did it. I made it. I'm a major league [player].' But he was calm. He was relaxed.\"\n\nShe wonders whether he was a little more nervous than he let on. She plans to ask him when he returns home in the off-season.\n\nIn any case, the day after that call, she was on a flight back to Houston. She cried on that plane \u2014 and cried again when they called his name during the starting lineups the next night, she said.\n\nHer son has always been a natural athlete but gravitated toward baseball early on, said Hernandez.\n\nLeft: Abraham Toro, 2, was drawn to baseball from a young age. Right: Toro made his baseball debut with the Saint-Hubert A's at age five. (Submitted by Yamila Hernandez)\n\nBaseball is the national pastime in Venezuela, but his greatest influence, she will tell you, is his older brother, Douglas Toro.\n\nDouglas, she said, \"was always pushing and pushing his brother [to be] the best, and now we are seeing the results.\"\n\nDouglas was Abraham's first coach, his mentor, his idol. Abraham even served as the bat boy while Douglas played for the Ducs de Longueuil, a junior elite team on Montreal's South Shore.\n\nGrowing up on fields and in stadiums across Quebec, his little brother loved every minute of it, Douglas Toro said.\n\n\"He was looking forward to being there, on the field, in the locker room, just hanging out with the guys.\"\n\nAs a pre-teen, Abraham Toro would go with his family to watch Douglas play college ball in Florida.\n\n\"At the time, I wanted to play in college just like him,\" said the younger Toro. \"It gave me more motivation.\"\n\nNever in doubt\n\nAbraham Toro has never really doubted that he could be a major league player, and neither has his family.\n\nDouglas Toro can remember the moment he knew his brother would be great. He was about 12, and he was hitting the ball so hard, Douglas was scared he was going to hurt someone.\n\nThat year, he also launched a ball close to 50 metres, more than 160 feet over a 3.6-metre-high wall in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res known as the Green Monster. (Yes, it's named after that Green Monster.)\n\n\"With my brother, it wasn't, 'Oh, he became better.' No. He was always good,\" said Douglas Toro.\n\nDouglas, left, with Abraham Toro at one Abraham's minor league games. Douglas, who is 13 years older than Abraham, says his little brother grew up around baseball \u2014 and has always loved it. (Submitted by Douglas Toro)\n\nAbraham Toro played in Quebec most of his life \u2014 attending \u00c9douard-Montpetit High School and Vanier College before leaving for Seminole State College in Florida in 2015.\n\nPlaying in a cold-weather climate came with challenges. Unlike those who live in the south, he had to practise indoors for most of the year. And not many scouts make the trip to Quebec looking for talent, he said.\n\n\"It made me think that I needed to work harder in order to be noticed,\" Toro said.\n\nAnd he did get noticed. His family believes his success will help others from Quebec.\n\n\"I think [his story] is going to give recognition for other players also,\" Douglas Toro said.", "description": "Since his start with Houston on Aug. 22, Abraham Toro has played to huge crowds, hit the home run in Toronto that helped Justin Verlander cement his third career no-hitter \u2014 and taken part in a champagne celebration when the Astros clinched a playoff spot.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303027.1569866499!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bba-astros-blue-jays-20190901.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
