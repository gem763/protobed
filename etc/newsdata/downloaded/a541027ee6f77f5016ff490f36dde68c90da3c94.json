That performance confirmed Jenny Ryan as one of my favourite people. What a performance! What a voice! What a song choice! Next Bond theme,\u2019 read one fan tweet with the hashtag #Goosebumps.\n\nAnother tweet read: \u2018Ok\u2026 so Jenny ryan is actually the only one with talent tonight\u2026 so far. Can hear her doing the next Bond movie,\u2019 while another excited viewer added: \u2018Jenny to sing Adele- Skyfall next!!\u2019\n\nOther enthusiastic responses compared Jenny to singer Alison Moyet and called for her to take on a Cher number next.\n\nJenny was off to a good start as she landed a Safe Chair live on the show.\n\nNicole Scherzinger called her performance \u2018ruthless and roofless because you blew the roof off\u2019.\n\nBut she was also called out by fellow judge Simon Cowell who held her and Louis Walsh responsible for not putting Jenny through in the first place.\n\n\u2018I never got a chance to say to Jenny, I tried to keep you in the competition,\u2019 he said live on air, totally throwing Scherzy and Louis under the bus.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity airs Saturdays on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
