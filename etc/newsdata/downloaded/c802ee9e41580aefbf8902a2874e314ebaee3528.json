He can blow up in your face,\u201d one senior government figure said. \u201cClearly we have got to maintain the relationship because the U.S. is a very important ally. But we need to remain close to the U.S. not close to Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe pair have been building something of a public friendship since Johnson won the keys to Downing Street in July. The commander-in-chief heaped has praise on Johnson since long before he won the Tory leadership, and they have been in touch an unusual amount since. Notably for a president prone to bust-ups on the world stage, Trump has shown Johnson considerably more leeway than other world leaders, all the more striking given how relations soured with Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nBut behind the scenes Team Johnson are aware Trump is always eyeing his own electoral gain.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a strength to be had, especially for Boris Johnson but also Donald Trump, in maintaining the optical illusion that they have a very strong relationship.\u201d \u2014 Leslie Vinjamuri, head of the U.S. and Americas program at the Chatham House institute\n\n\u201cHe is not focused on the relationship; he\u2019s focused on getting reelected,\u201d the senior government figure said. \u201cHe is always in that mode. So we just need to be very careful about how we engage.\u201d\n\nThis mindset can also prove useful. Johnson made an eye-catching intervention on Iran on Monday night in an interview with U.S. broadcaster NBC, saying only Trump could re-negotiate the \"bad\" Iran deal.\n\nIf the aim was to flatter the president into coming to the negotiating table with Iran, it could prove effective. Trump had responded enthusiastically to an earlier Johnson interview in which he suggested a fresh Iran pact.\n\n\u201cThat's why he's a winner,\u201d the president told a White House pool reporter. \u201cThat's why he's a man who\u2019s going to be successful in the U.K.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \"Number one, he\u2019s a friend of mine. Number two, he\u2019s very smart, very tough.\"\n\nJohnson, on the other hand, has been less enthusiastic about pegging himself too closely to the U.S. president. As he flew over the Atlantic to the U.N. summit on Sunday night, he was asked by POLITICO whether he would describe Trump as his \"closest friend\" among world leaders.\n\nThe prime minister dodged the question. \u201cI have a good relationship with many leaders around the world,\" he said. \"And I think it\u2019s very important that the U.K. has a strong close working relationship with the United States of America, which is after all our No. 1 ally.\"\n\nA Downing Street official pushed back against any notion Johnson would be keeping his distance from Trump.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be keeping him at arm's length and have proved so far not to be keeping him at arm's length with the level of interaction and the things that we are working on together,\u201d they said.\n\nDon't call it a bromance\n\nIn the immediate weeks after Johnson took office, a bromance seemed to blossom between the blonds. The pair spoke on the phone around five times in the run-up to their first meeting at the G7 summit in Biarritz, where they shared a breakfast of scrambled eggs and veal sausage.\n\nBut despite the constructed closeness, there are clear policy disagreements which, if badly managed, risk a rapid crumbling of the relationship.\n\nA Downing Street official put the favorable treatment from Trump down to Johnson\u2019s \u201ccompetence\u201d and record as London mayor. \u201cWe are in a very positive place of working with a leader who seems to be in favor of us,\u201d they said.\n\nBut they swerved around the word \u201cbromance\u201d in describing the Johnson-Trump dynamic \u2014 a term used to characterize the relationships between David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Tony Blair and George W. Bush before them. \u201cWe prefer not to compare it to previous relationships,\u201d the official said. \u201cBoris Johnson and Donald Trump share a unique relationship to them, which is working well for both administrations.\u201d\n\nLeslie Vinjamuri, head of the U.S. and Americas program at the Chatham House institute, said the friendship is something of a sham: \u201cThere is certainly a strength to be had, especially for Boris Johnson but also Donald Trump, in maintaining the optical illusion that they have a very strong relationship.\u201d\n\nJohnson is desperate for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington, she said, and Trump, as well as respecting the hard line approach to Brexit, is open to a deal.\n\nBeyond that, she noted, there is a world of disagreement between the pair. Trump has ditched the Iran nuclear deal and wants to take a harder line with Tehran, while Johnson, at least until Monday, had argued for holding the pact together. Trump is a climate skeptic, while Johnson has put the agenda at the \u201cabsolute core\u201d of his government\u2019s actions. Trump has responded to the rise of China with a trade war, while Johnson has insisted he will be pro-China and has voiced his opposition to tariffs.\n\nVinjamuri argued the Trump approach to Johnson \u2014 of a superficial bromance with disagreements bubbling beneath \u2014 mirrors his approach with other world leaders, including China\u2019s Xi Jinping, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Japan\u2019s Shinz\u014d Abe. \u201cThere is a bromance but then there is a failure to align on any number of policies,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson is certainly not scared to bring policy differences to the fore. At the G7 breakfast meeting, he told Trump to his face, albeit sheepishly, that Britain prefers \u201ctrade peace\u201d to trade war. Trump sucked it up. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, with a pout.\n\nOther world leaders could have expected a barrage of angry tweets once Trump had clambered back into Air Force One. But not Johnson.\n\nThe prime minister thus far has enjoyed a leeway with the president that few others seem to achieve \u2014 while simultaneously failing to return the outpouring of flattery. During the presidential election in 2016 he said Trump betrayed a \u201cstupefying ignorance\u201d and was unfit for office after the candidate claimed there were \u201cno-go areas\u201d in London swamped with Islamic extremism.\n\nTripwires will hove into view again when the pair meet on Tuesday morning.\n\nJohnson declared on the plane to New York that he would be raising the climate issue directly with the president. \"I will be making the point to President Trump \u2014 a point I\u2019ve made many times before \u2014 that we must tackle climate change together and we must tackle the loss of species together,\" he said.\n\nJohnson even announced environmental funds to combat climate change and save endangered animals ahead of the event. He also said he would gripe to Trump about tariffs and regulations covering the import of British socks to the U.S.\n\n\"If you try to sell British socks in North America they currently attract a 19 percent tariff,\" he said. \"And the Americans insist, before they allow British socks to be sold on the U.S. market, that they must try to set fire to them twice.\" Sock manufacturers, however, were less convinced.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest driving characteristics of both Johnson and Trump is that they want to be liked\u201d \u2014 Sophia Gaston, managing director at the British Foreign Policy Group\n\nDespite clear policy differences, both sides were keen to demonstrate their cooperation ahead of the U.N. General Assembly, with a preliminary phone call briefed to journalists last Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think UNGA will be another opportunity to continue that positive engagement,\u201d the No. 10 official said.\n\nHey, big personality\n\nFor all the policy differences, the two leaders share similarities in political style.\n\nBoth are unorthodox political personalities who know how to set the media narrative alight. \u201cThe camaraderie between the two stems from both a sense of shared personal characteristics and also a strategic alignment of interests,\u201d said Sophia Gaston, managing director at the British Foreign Policy Group. Gaston noted Trump respects a \u201cstrong man\u201d persona, and points out that there is \u201cno part of the existing world order that [he] considers to be sacred.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest driving characteristics of both Johnson and Trump is that they want to be liked,\u201d she said, \u201cand this may end up shaping and tempering their choices.\u201d\n\nJohnson has long been characterized as thriving off affection, while Trump\u2019s thin skin and his selective assessment of supporters and protesters reveal his vulnerabilities.\n\nSome of their personal similarities could be hindrances though. \u201cIt seems unlikely they can truly establish a long term professional relationship that puts the interests of their nations above their egos,\u201d one senior Tory MP said. \u201cLook at every other Trump or Johnson relationship \u2014 it seems unlikely that either can truly have a relationship of equals.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
