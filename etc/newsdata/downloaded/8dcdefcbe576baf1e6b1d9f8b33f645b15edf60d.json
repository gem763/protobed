The report also names Shaw as the fastest in four of the country\u2019s most populous cities \u2014 Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg \u2014 and the second fastest provider in Canada.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe results released by Ookla show that our customers are experiencing the fast internet speeds they need for today and the future,\u201d said Brad Shaw, Chief Executive Officer, Shaw Communications. \u201cOver the past seven years, we have invested more than $20 billion to significantly improve the quality and capacity of our FibrePlus network and services \u2014 making our best experience available to 98 per cent of homes and businesses in Western Canada through innovative and affordable packages.\n\n\u201cThese results not only confirm that Canada\u2019s fixed broadband speeds continue to rapidly increase \u2014 but they clearly demonstrate that these speed increases are due entirely to investments made by the Canadian network-building internet providers,\u201d Mr. Shaw said.\n\nThe Ookla Speedtest Intelligence report shows Canadians have access to some of the world\u2019s best and fastest wireline networks.
