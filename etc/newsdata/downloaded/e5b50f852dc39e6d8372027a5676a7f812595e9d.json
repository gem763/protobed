He had one of his previous suspensions reduced from five games to three games on an appeal in 2017.\n\nIt's that history that led to the most severe punishment the NFL has handed out when it comes to player safety, topping the five games Tennessee's Albert Haynesworth got in 2006 for kicking and stomping on Cowboys centre Andre Gurode's face, leading to 30 stitches.\n\nBurfict had served two three-game suspensions already in his career and had been warned about severe punishment for future infractions.\n\n'Unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided'\n\n\"There were no mitigating circumstances on this play,\" NFL Vice-President of football operations Jon Runyan said in a letter to Burfict announcing the suspension. \"Your contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game.\n\n\"Following each of your previous rule violations, you were warned by me and each of the jointly-appointed appeal officers that future violations would result in escalated accountability measures. However, you have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk.\"\n\n\"Your extensive history of rules violations is factored into this decision regarding accountability measures.\"\n\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING\ud83d\udea8<br><br>Vontaze Burfict has been suspended for the rest of the 2019 season for this hit on Colts TE Jack Doyle. <a href=\"https://t.co/eHdtuXobyU\">pic.twitter.com/eHdtuXobyU</a> \u2014@FinishTheBiz\n\nThe suspension is without pay, costing Burfict more than $1.1 million US in salary and per game active roster bonuses.\n\nBurfict was flagged for unnecessary roughness and ejected from the Raiders' game against the Colts on Sunday after a blow to Doyle's head early in the second quarter.\n\n\"I just got tackled,\" Doyle said after the game. \"I'm sure it looked worse than it was. I didn't really feel anything from it. My helmet protected me.\"\n\n'I can't go in there playing patty-cake'\n\nBurfict during his time in Cincinnati was repeatedly suspended by the NFL for egregious hits and violating its policy on performance-enhancers. He was fined regularly for hits that crossed the line, most notably the one to Antonio Brown's head that helped the Steelers rally for an 18-16 playoff win in the 2015 season. That led to a three-game suspension to start the 2016 season.\n\nBurfict then was penalized for a blind-side block against Kansas City fullback Anthony Sherman in the 2017 preseason that led to a five-game suspension that was later reduced to three games.\n\nBurfict was also fined $112,000 last season for hits on Brown and James Conner in a game against Pittsburgh.\n\nDespite that history, Burfict said after signing with the Raiders that he disputes accusations that he is a \"dirty\" player.\n\n\"I play a physical position, which is middle linebacker, outside linebacker. That's physical,\" he said. \"I can't go in there playing patty-cake. If I go out there playing patty-cake, then I'm going to be getting run over. I have 300-pound linemen, 300-plus pound linemen coming at me, trying to block me. If I play soft, then I'm not doing my job. I could see if I played quarterback or kicker or punter, then yeah you can be, I wouldn't say soft, but you know what I'm saying. I play a physical position to where I have to put my jockstrap on right, put my shoes on right, put my cleats on right and come out ready to play physical.\"\n\nBurfict also was suspended for the first four games in 2018 for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancers.", "description": "Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict was suspended Monday for the rest of the season for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle that is the most severe punishment in NFL history for an on-field infraction.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303645.1569885661!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/burfict-vontaze-093019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
