I thought Emery was brilliant in the press conference when he said he would deal with it internally.\n\n\u2018The only thing that surprises me is that Xhaka hasn\u2019t come out an apologised to the fans.\u2019\n\nMORE: Paul Merson defends Granit Xhaka following outburst against Arsenal supporters\n\nMORE: Unai Emery urges Arsenal fans to stick with the club after Granit Xhaka incident", "description": "David Seaman believes Granit Xhaka was out of order for his conduct towards Arsenal fans, but hailed Unai Emery's handling of the situation.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-11838027582_1572383743.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
