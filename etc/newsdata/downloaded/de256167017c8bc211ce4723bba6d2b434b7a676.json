He\u2019s a liar. He lied to everybody. So that\u2019s a man I do not trust. I would hope nobody else would, too.\u201d\n\nCollins said he was bothered that he \u201cnever\u201d spoke with the general manager personally throughout the process. The All-Pro safety wanted to be at least told of a decision, one way or another, from Gettleman. \u201cThe handling of it was horrible,\u201d he said.\n\nCollins isn\u2019t the first player to take issue with Gettleman\u2019s approach. Redskins cornerback Josh Norman also appears to be upset with Gettleman, who was the GM of the Carolina Panthers in 2016 when Norman\u2019s franchise tag was rescinded.\n\nNorman and Collins both ripped Gettleman for claiming in an interview this offseason that the way to handle difficult news was by making sure to give them \u201ctheir dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at that, it\u2019s full of [expletive],\u201d Norman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I feel about the situation and him. If you really want to be honest, every time I see him, I really want to like smash their face in the grass. That\u2019s how I really feel about it.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins play the Giants in Week 4\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
