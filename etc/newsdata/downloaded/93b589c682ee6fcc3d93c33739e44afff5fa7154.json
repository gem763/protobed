A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Two years ago, the company said in a filing that it had raised $27m (about R382m) of a planned funding round of as much as $100m (about R1.4bn).\n\nNeuralink was registered as a California medical research company in 2016 and has operated quietly from San Francisco since then. The company has hired away several high-profile neuroscientists from various universities and contracted with a laboratory at the University of California, Davis to conduct research on primates.\n\nThe venture has both awed and repelled various Musk watchers over the possibilities that it seemingly offers for connecting brains to computers. In March, a paper by a group of researchers affiliated with Neuralink was posted online. It outlined a novel technique for implanting electrodes into rat brains.\n\nIn April, when asked by a Twitter user for a Neuralink update, Musk replied \"Probably something notable to announce in a few months.\"\n\n\n\nSeparately, Tim Gardner, a co-founder of Neuralink and a prominent early hire for the company, is taking a job as a professor of neuroengineering at the University of Oregon. He joined Neuralink from Boston University in March 2017.", "description": "Neuralink, a small and secretive brain computing startup founded by Elon Musk, has raised $39m of a planned $51m filing round.", "authors": ["Sarah Mcbride"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8594/c7810ba46023493485bffb72a5a521c5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-11"}
