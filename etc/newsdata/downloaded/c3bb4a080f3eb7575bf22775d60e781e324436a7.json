And, Carroll knows it.\n\n\u201cEarl was an incredible competitor, and I loved coaching him,\u201d the Seahawks coach said. \u201cI think it will be fun playing against him.\u201d\n\nWell, it certainly should be fun to watch the two quarterbacks in this one, with Russell Wilson off to possibly the best start of his career for Seattle and Lamar Jackson making plays with his arm and legs for Baltimore.\n\nWilson doesn\u2019t have an interception yet and is just the fourth quarterback to have a passer rating of 100 or higher in the first six games of a season. He\u2019s trying to get the Seahawks to 6-1 for only the second time in franchise history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like playing against Steph Curry in basketball, if you will,\u201d Ravens defensive coordinator Don Martindale said. \u201cYou can pick him half court and he\u2019s going to try to drive by you or you can slack off and he\u2019s going to pull up and hit a 3.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Jackson became the first NFL player with 200 yards passing and 150 yards rushing in the same regular-season game, accomplishing the feat last week in a 23-17 win over Cincinnati. His 460 yards rushing rank him fourth in the AFC. Yes, as a quarterback.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as good as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cHe\u2019s as fast and as elusive as we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nWeek 7 opened with Kansas City\u2019s 30-6 victory at Denver, a win tempered by the loss of reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes to a right knee injury in the second quarter.\n\nBackup Matt Moore threw a 57-yard touchdown pass to Tyreek Hill and the Chiefs (5-2) had nine sacks, gave up a season-low 71 yards rushing and snapped a two-game skid in beating the Broncos (2-5) for the eighth straight time. His balky left ankle heavily taped, Mahomes completed 10 of 11 passes for 76 yards and a touchdown before he was hurt on a successful sneak on fourth-and-inches at the Denver 5.\n\nCarolina (4-2), Cleveland (2-4), Pittsburgh (2-4) and Tampa Bay (2-4) are all off this week.\n\nPHILADELPHIA (3-3) at DALLAS (3-3)\n\nAn early season showdown for first place in the NFC East in a Sunday night matchup of teams coming off losses.\n\nThe Cowboys are actually on a three-game losing streak after a 3-0 start, falling last Sunday 24-22 to the previously winless Jets. Dallas hasn\u2019t lost four in a row since 2015, when it dropped seven straight after then-quarterback Tony Romo was hurt in Week 2. Dak Prescott and the Cowboys, whose offense ranks No. 2 overall in the NFL, hope to avoid a similar fate - and they have some optimism. Dallas has won three in a row in the series against Philadelphia.\n\nThat might mean little to Carson Wentz and the Eagles, though. They\u2019re the only division rival with a winning record at AT&T; Stadium (6-4). But they\u2019ll need to turn things around after falling to Minnesota 38-20 last week.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (5-0) at WASHINGTON (1-5)\n\nThe 49ers head into this week joining New England as the only undefeated teams in the league, and they look to make it 6-0 for only the third time in franchise history.\n\nSan Francisco is 5-0 for the first time since 1990, and has been getting the job done on both sides of the ball. Jimmy Garoppolo, the eighth quarterback in the Super Bowl era with 13-plus wins in his first 15 starts, leads the No. 4 overall offense in the league. The 49ers\u2019 defense is off to an even more impressive start, ranking second overall behind a stingy showing in a 20-7 win over the Los Angeles Rams. San Francisco gave up just 48 net yards passing, and allowed no conversions on third or fourth down for the first time since 1988.\n\nLowly Washington edged Miami 17-16 last week in Bill Callahan\u2019s debut as the Redskins\u2019 interim coach. The Redskins are 9\u00bd point underdogs in this one, and Washington hasn\u2019t won at home since Week 7 in 2018.\n\nNEW ORLEANS (5-1) at CHICAGO (3-2)\n\nTeddy Bridgewater has done everything he can to help offset the loss of Drew Brees to a torn ligament in his right thumb, going 4-0 in his place as the NFC South-leading Saints\u2019 starting quarterback. And, while the Saints might not light up the scoreboard as they did last season, they\u2019re getting consistently solid performances from their defense and special teams.\n\nThe Bears are hoping to have quarterback Mitchell Trubisky back after he missed one game because of an injured left shoulder. Chase Daniel, who had two stints as a backup in New Orleans, would make his second straight start if Trubisky can\u2019t go.\n\nHOUSTON (4-2) at INDIANAPOLIS (3-2)\n\nA rematch of last season\u2019s wild-card round matchup in which the Colts beat the Texans 21-7. Andrew Luck was the quarterback for Indianapolis then, though, before opting to retire in the summer.\n\nJacoby Brissett has taken over for the Colts and has been sacked just six times, tied for the second fewest in the league. In fact, Indianapolis has not allowed sack since Week 3. The Colts\u2019 offensive line will be put to the test this week against J.J. Watt, Whitney Mercilus and the Texans\u2019 pass rush.\n\nDeshaun Watson is off to an excellent start and has six touchdown passes the past two games, but also threw two interceptions in the Texans\u2019 victory at Kansas City last week.\n\nMINNESOTA (4-2) at DETROIT (2-2-1)\n\nA quick turnaround helped prevent the Lions from dwelling too long on the calls at Green Bay on Monday night that didn\u2019t go their way in a 23-22 loss.\n\nAfter Detroit opened the season 2-0-1, it has lost two straight - and its failure to hold onto double-digit leads against the Packers and Kansas City Chiefs are a major culprit.\n\nMatthew Stafford and the Lions could be in for a shootout in this one, though. Kirk Cousins has an NFL-high 142.5 rating the past two weeks for the Vikings with 639 yards passing, six TDs and one interception.\n\nARIZONA (2-3-1) at N.Y. GIANTS (2-4)\n\nWhile the records might not be eye-popping, the future is now for both the Cardinals and Giants - who each think, and hope, they\u2019ve got their franchise quarterbacks.\n\nKyler Murray, the No. 1 overall draft pick in April, has mostly played up to the lofty expectations while starting every game for Arizona. Daniel Jones, taken No. 6 overall by the Giants, has stepped in for the benched Eli Manning and showed some impressive playmaking ability while going 2-2 as the starter.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second time two rookie starting quarterbacks selected in the top 10 in the common era of the draft face each other, with the first being last year when Sam Darnold of the Jets (No. 3) faced Josh Allen of the Bills (No. 7).\n\nJones and the Giants could also get star running back Saquon Barkley back after he missed three games with an injured right ankle.\n\nOAKLAND (3-2) at GREEN BAY (5-1)\n\nThe suddenly streaking Raiders are looking to win three straight for the first time since 2016. And, if they can pull it off, it would be all on the road - something Oakland hasn\u2019t done since the playoffs following the 1980 season.\n\nJon Gruden\u2019s guys are coming off a bye-week break after playing in London, and now they\u2019ll have to go into Lambeau Field against Aaron Rodgers and a Packers team that is playing well.\n\nGreen Bay has also defeated Oakland seven straight times, dating to 1990. The Packers will look to keep that going under Matt LaFleur, the first head coach in franchise history to win five of his first six games.\n\nNEW ENGLAND (6-0) at N.Y. JETS (1-4)\n\nTom Brady and the Patriots cruised to the fourth 6-0 start in team history, and have their sights set on the franchise\u2019s third 7-0 start.\n\nThey\u2019ll have to do it Monday night against the AFC East-rival Jets, who earned their first win of the season last week with quarterback Sam Darnold back under center after missing three games with mononucleosis. New York could be getting linebacker C.J. Mosley, sidelined since the season opener with a groin injury, back in the middle of its defense. Both players missed the teams\u2019 first meeting this season, when the Patriots won 30-14 with third-string quarterback Luke Falk making his first NFL start for the Jets.\n\nThe Patriots have won seven straight against the Jets, and would clinch a fourth straight series sweep with a prime-time victory.\n\nLA RAMS (3-3) at ATLANTA (1-5)\n\nJared Goff and the Rams got off to a 3-0 start and looked every bit like a team with designs on a Super Bowl run.\n\nWell, they\u2019ve lost three straight since and have struggled mightily in the process. Goff passed for a career-low 78 yards in a 2-7 loss to San Francisco and the once high-scoring Rams got just 157 net yards. There\u2019s some buzz in LA, though, after the Rams acquired star cornerback Jalen Ramsey from Jacksonville this week for two first-round draft picks and a fourth-rounder. There\u2019s a chance he could make his Rams debut if he passes a medical exam after missing the Jaguars\u2019 past three games with a back injury.\n\nThings have gone from bad to worse in Atlanta, where Dan Quinn\u2019s job security is being questioned with the Falcons on a four-game skid. Quarterback Matt Ryan has been a bright spot, though, with an NFL-leading 15 touchdown passes. He\u2019s also trying to become the first player in NFL history to pass for at least 300 yards in each of his team\u2019s first seven games.\n\nLA CHARGERS (2-4) at TENNESSEE (2-4)\n\nBoth the Chargers and Titans are teams at crossroads early in the season after entering with playoff hopes. They have each dropped their past two games and four of five.\n\nThat slow start contributed to a quarterback change in Tennessee, where Ryan Tannehill steps in for Marcus Mariota. It will be Tannehill\u2019s first start for the Titans after he went 13 of 16 for 144 yards with one interception off the bench in Tennessee\u2019s 16-0 loss to Denver. One positive for the Titans: Tannehill is 3-1 against the Chargers with six TDs and one interception.\n\nPhilip Rivers and the Chargers\u2019 offense have been looking for consistency while also trying to cut down on mistakes. Rivers has turned the ball over eight times this season after having just 13 turnovers last season.\n\nMIAMI (0-5) at BUFFALO (4-1)\n\nIt\u2019s FitzMagic time for the Dolphins, who are starting journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback after benching Josh Rosen.\n\nMiami has scored a league-low 42 points, so Brian Flores turned to Fitzpatrick to try to jumpstart the offense against the team for which he played four seasons.\n\nBut Fitzpatrick and the Dolphins will have to try to do it against the surprising Bills, who are off to their best start since 2011 and have yet to allow more than 17 points or 250 yards passing in a game this season.\n\nJACKSONVILLE (2-4) at CINCINNATI (0-6)\n\nThis might be the perfect game for Minshew Mania to get back on track.\n\nGardner Minshew and the Jaguars were held to a season-low 226 yards in a 13-6 loss to New Orleans last week. A bounce-back could be in store against the Bengals, who\u2019ll likely be without injured starting cornerbacks Dre Kirkpatrick and William Jackson III.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t bode well for Cincinnati, which still hasn\u2019t won under first-year coach Zac Taylor and looks to prevent its first 0-7 start since 2008.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Earl Thomas is going back to the place where it all started for him.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/ravens_thomas_football_10152_c0-165-3956-2472_s1200x700.jpg?42952fd776e34f65e69d9d52f89c5df88c6ca68c", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
