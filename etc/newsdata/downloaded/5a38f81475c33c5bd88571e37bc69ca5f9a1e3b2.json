To reality.\n\nReality, for Stephanie, means being a loving wife and mother; the busy woman in the office who gets things done; the daughter her ageing parents turn to for help because she lives much closer than her two older siblings.\n\nBombshell FEMAIL survey reveals that one in five women have had an affair - and just under 50 per cent of their partners remain oblivious to it (stock image)\n\n\u2018I just get on with it all, to the best of my ability and without complaint, because all those things are important to me,\u2019 stresses Stephanie, 40, who lives with her lawyer husband Michael and their 14-year-old daughter in Manchester.\n\n\u2018But there\u2019s another side to me that I now realise was seriously neglected until I started having an affair 18 months ago. Part of me wants to shake off the burden of responsibility once in a while; to be seen as a sexual being, above everything else, for a few hours.\u2019\n\nIt sounds hard to understand or accept. Yet the double life that Stephanie keeps a secret from all but her closest friend \u2014 someone she says has enjoyed the odd dalliance herself \u2014 is less unusual than you might think.\n\nAccording to an in-depth sex and relationship survey conducted by Femail, one in five British adult women has had an affair \u2014 and 40 per cent of those have been unfaithful to their current partner.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, nearly half of those husbands and partners \u2014 47 per cent, according to the women we polled \u2014 remain oblivious to the fact that they were, or indeed are, being deceived.\n\nThe shocking survey also found that 40 per cent of women had been unfaithful to their partners during the relationship (stock image)\n\nToday, in the second part of our exclusive nationwide survey, we share the fascinating insights gained by talking candidly to more than 1,000 women of all ages about their sex lives, asking whether they\u2019ve strayed and, if so, what they did to heal their relationship in the aftermath.\n\nThe results, and testimony from women like Stephanie, suggest that infidelity for women has as much to do with wanting a distraction from the mundanities of real life as physical thrills.\n\nAnd it confirms just how dire and far-reaching the consequences can be for both parties.\n\nStephanie, a merchandiser for a large department store, is adamant she has no intention of leaving her husband. It would break up her family, cause heartache and disrupt a life that makes her broadly happy.\n\n\u2018I love our home, we have a good social life, and I still have sex with Michael once a week or so,\u2019 she says. \u2018OK, I find him a bit dull after nearly 20 years together. He\u2019s a workaholic and so consumed with his job that I often wish he\u2019d find something else to talk about.\n\n\u2018But I love him and can\u2019t imagine spending my life with anyone else. In fact, I hoped our sex life might eventually be reignited by my affair.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d hate to spoil what we have, and I\u2019m incredibly careful not to get caught. The fact I travel for work makes it easy to get away with the odd extra night here and there.\u2019\n\nthough Stephanie\u2019s lover is also married, she claims she doesn\u2019t feel jealousy, or even guilt, towards his wife. \u2018Neither of us wants anything long-term. If he announced he was leaving his wife, honestly I\u2019d run a mile,\u2019 she insists.\n\n\u2018Maybe I should feel guilty that I\u2019m betraying my daughter as well as her dad. But the way I see it, I\u2019m happier at home, while my sexual needs are being met elsewhere. Isn\u2019t that better?\u2019\n\nOf course, many people would disagree with this assessment. Yet Stephanie is extremely self-aware and says she regards her affair as totally separate from her marriage \u2014 an exciting diversion with, as she sees it, minimal risk. It\u2019s become a way of nourishing a side to her that family life quells.\n\n\u2018This is what so often happens in an affair,\u2019 says psychotherapist Lucy Beresford, author of Happy Relationships. \u2018Women can feel a little exploited, to varying degrees, in their real-life roles. They\u2019re working hard at being a brilliant wife, fantastic mother, dutiful daughter, and pushing themselves at work, too \u2014 but something\u2019s missing.\n\n\u2018Having an affair becomes a way of attending to the part of their psyche that feels neglected, without the pain and disruption of walking away from their marriage.\u2019\n\nLucy adds: \u2018It is possible to overcome a sense of feeling neglected within a marriage, but you have to acknowledge it to yourself first.\n\nKatherine Burton, 40, from Manchester, said she started an affair so that she could feel like a 'sexual being' again as her husband is often consumed with work (stock image)\n\n\u2018Sometimes, feeling abandoned or ignored by our partner is so horrendously painful we bury the emotion and \u201cact it out\u201d by seeking affection or desirability elsewhere.\u2019\n\nViewed in this way, infidelity becomes about much more than sex \u2014 straying is a way of staying in the marriage without having to rock the boat by making it plain that certain needs aren\u2019t being met. It softens the blow of feeling that your priorities so often seem to come after everyone else\u2019s.\n\nPsychotherapist Lucy Beresford offered her advice on why affairs take place\n\n\u2018These don\u2019t tend to be conscious conversations people have with themselves,\u2019 says Lucy. \u2018But, deep down, a trade is being made \u2014 the affair is what stops them from getting angry about what\u2019s wrong with their life, so they don\u2019t actually have to do something about it.\u2019\n\nThere are, of course, many other reasons women are unfaithful: an affair can be an act of revenge on a partner who\u2019s strayed first, or a way of expressing frustration at unreasonable behaviour.\n\nFor others, it can simply be a deep-rooted pattern of behaviour connected to low self-esteem, lack of care for others, or going back to destructive early relationships.\n\nOr it can be entirely out of character, becoming part of an escape route out of a miserable relationship. This was the case with Rachel Morgan, a 38-year- old translator whose affair with a colleague, she says, provided the wake-up call that led to her ending a four-year relationship.\n\nRachel Morgan, 38, used an affair to help her get out of a miserable relationship where her ex was 'incredibly childish' and 'hopeless around the house'\n\n\u2018Living with my ex was like being the mother of a grown man,\u2019 she says. \u2018He was incredibly childish, hopeless around the house, constantly wanting me to fix his problems for him. I\u2019d stopped fancying him. We weren\u2019t even having sex.\u2019\n\nDespite her unhappiness, Rachel, from London, didn\u2019t feel a strong drive to leave her partner, who was the same age.\n\nUntil, that is, a work project took her away for several weeks and she began spending time with a male colleague. \u2018I started to feel more mentally stimulated,\u2019 she says. \u2018We were having interesting conversations, and I found his company relaxed and fun.\n\n\u2018When we started having sex, it felt inevitable, but it soon became about far more than that.\n\n\u2018My lover was bringing out the best in me, and that made me look at my relationship and appreciate how much it was dragging me down. I realised I didn\u2019t want to fix things. I wanted to start again.\u2019\n\nExtricating herself from an unhappy relationship in this way wasn\u2019t intended \u2014 and it was painful for both parties \u2014 but, ultimately, the spotlight that the infidelity shone on Rachel\u2019s relationship couldn\u2019t be switched off.\n\nThe survey also found that fewer than one in ten couples sought counselling after discovering that one of the partners had had an affair (stock image)\n\n\u2018An affair often forces us to look in the mirror and explore whether we like who we\u2019ve become in our relationship,\u2019 says Lucy Beresford. \u2018Whether or not you get found out, it becomes a driver for change.\u2019\n\nYet our survey \u2014 which looks beyond the number of confessions of clandestine affairs to what happens next \u2014 found that fewer than one in ten (8 per cent) of couples sought counselling after discovering one partner had had an affair, even though the emotional fallout is often extremely complex.\n\nCouples\u2019 therapist Hilda Burke is not surprised. \u2018The thing that\u2019s creating problems in a relationship needn\u2019t be a lover \u2014 it can be difficult in-laws, work, an addiction, or even your children,\u2019 she explains.\n\nCouples' therapist Hilda Burke talked about what can cause problems in relationships\n\n\u2018Certainly, in my practice, those tend to be the issues that people bring to therapy far more than wanting help following an affair.\u2019\n\nIs that an issue when it comes to working through difficult feelings after infidelity?\n\n\u2018Not necessarily,\u2019 says Hilda. \u2018If a couple have the emotional intelligence to recognise that the affair was a symptom of bigger problems within the relationship and have committed to staying together and working at fixing them, then they may well be able to do that without therapy.\u2019\n\nWhether your marriage has been threatened by infidelity in the past, or you find yourself nodding along to some of the emotional motives for women to stray, the best cure for a lull in your relationship is to talk about it \u2014 and seek help if you are not satisfied.\n\nSome names have been changed.
