Public hearings promote transparency and provide the court with insights and information that the court might otherwise not be aware of.\u201d\n\nBrad Edwards, a lawyer who represents a number of women who say they were sexually abused by Epstein, said: \u201cI have in the courtroom today 15 victims I represent and have represented over the years. There are at least 20 more who didn\u2019t make this hearing today.\u201d\n\nHe said Epstein\u2019s \u201cuntimely death\u201d was \u201ccurious\u201d. He added: \u201cMore so, it makes it absolutely impossible for the victims to ever get the day in court that they wanted, and to get full justice.

It felt like a whole new trauma\u2026It didn\u2019t feel good to wake up that morning and find that he allegedly committed suicide.\u201d\n\nEpstein was arrested on July 6 and pleaded not guilty to federal charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of girls as young as 14. He was found dead earlier this month, a day after new court documents that revealed more details of the allegations against him and others, were unsealed \u2013 something that has helped further fuel conspiracy theories about his death. An autopsy concluded he hanged himself.\n\nEpstein\u2019s arrest in New York came more than a decade after he voided being prosecuted on similar federal charges in Florida by striking a deal that allowed him to plead guilty to state prostitution charges.\n\nThat deal, which has been widely criticised as too lenient, resulted in Epstein serving 13 months in a county jail, which he was allowed to leave during the day on work release.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "A number of women who accused disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein of sexually abusing them, have appeared in court to powerfully denounce the fact he escaped justice by taking his own life.
