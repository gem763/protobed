Guyger said she had accidently entered Jean's apartment thinking it was her own and shot him because she believed he was an intruder.\n\nGuyger had faced a sentence of up to 99 years after the jury convicted her for murder, rather than the lesser charge of manslaughter. During the hearing, Jean's brother Brant told Guyger \"I forgive you\" before hugging her. The judge in the case also hugged Guyger and gave her a Bible after the sentencing.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nSome activists celebrated the guilty verdict as a sign that the Black Lives Matter movement has made progress in creating accountability in deadly police shootings. \u201cThis is a victory for black people in America,\u201d the Jean family's attorney said. Guyger\u2019s relatively short sentence, some countered, showed how much leeway white police officers have in the criminal justice system.\n\nOthers argued that it was inappropriate to treat this case as a proxy for other police shootings like those of Michael Brown and Philando Castile, since Guyger was not on duty at the time. The specter of those incidents may have caused Guyger to receive harsher treatment, some argue.\n\nThe decisions the judge and Jean\u2019s brother to embrace Guyger also led to discussion of the role of forgiveness and whether white defendants are treated more sympathetically. The Dallas County district attorney called it a \u201can extraordinary act of healing and forgiveness.\u201d Others lamented the hugs, with one writer worrying they would be treated \u201cas a proxy for meaningful, lasting justice.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nJean\u2019s family filed a lawsuit against the city of Dallas last year, saying that police department policies predisposed Guyger to using deadly force rather than safely de-escalating the situation. \u201cThe city of Dallas needs to clean up inside,\u201d Jean\u2019s mother said after the sentencing. That suit had been on hold, but may resume now that the criminal case has been resolved. Amber Guyger will be eligible for parole after serving five years.\n\nPerspectives\n\nThe guilty verdict shows that the efforts of Black Lives Matter are working.\n\n\"...this guilty verdict sends a resounding message that black and brown lives do matter, and that no one is above the law. It is a step in the right direction as we continue to fight for police accountability, criminal justice reform and equality.\" \u2014 Al Sharpton, New York Daily News\n\nThe conviction shows that police officers are starting to be treated as normal citizens under the law.\n\n\u201cNo serious person argues that juries should be biased against cops. But for too long juries have demonstrated bias for police officers, applying a level of grace and deference far beyond what the law permits.\u201d \u2014 David French, National Review\n\nGuyger\u2019s race and job led to a harsher sentence.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel that in this instance, Guyger\u2019s chosen profession doomed her at trial. She made a horrible, incomprehensible, unfathomable mistake. An innocent man paid with his life. But the case of Jean\u2019s death was ultimately a mistake, one that someone of a different skin hue or serving in a different profession may very well have been forgiven.\u201d \u2014 James Gagliano, Washington Examiner\n\nThe uncommon racial makeup of the jury played a major role.\n\n\u201cThis exceptional verdict is due in no small part to a diverse jury pool \u2014 many of whom shared a racial background with Botham Jean. Of the 12 jurors and four alternates, seven were black, five were non-black people of color, and four were white. \u2026 Which brings us to the obvious question: Would a whiter jury have convicted Amber Guyger of murder? I fear the answer is no.\u201d \u2014 Brittany Packnett, Vox\n\nThe unique circumstances of the case make it difficult to compare with other police shootings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear if Guygers murder conviction will have an impact on the policing community \u2014 especially because Guyger was off duty at the time of the shooting, and the circumstances were unique.\u201d \u2014 Darran Simon and Holly Yan, CNN\n\nGuyger received a level of sympathy in sentencing that people of color rarely see.", "description": "Former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of her neighbor Botham Jean.
