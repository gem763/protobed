She is scheduled to be sentenced in January.\n\nProsecutors said it is one of the largest schemes ever in the state and an example of 'obscene greed.'\n\n'That money didn\u2019t get to get spent on college tuition or retirement,' US Attorney Robert Hur said after the sentencing. 'That money went to luxury sports cars, and high-end watches, and expensive clothes and shoes, and extravagant mansions here in Maryland on the Eastern Shore and in Naples, Florida.'\n\nMerrill is required to pay restitution in the amount of $189.1million to the more than 160 victims in monthly installments.\n\nHur said Merrill's elaborate web of lies has ruined the lives of innocent people, many of whom were left devastated after losing their retirement and college funds, as CBS Baltimore reported.\n\nThe court heard impact statements from several of Merrill's victims, including John Paradise, from New Jersey, who revealed that the defendant conned him out of $250,000 that had been set aside for his three daughters' college tuition.\n\n'I'm trying to be the best dad I can be, but I have nothing left for my kids,' the man said, according to WBAL-TV.\n\nUS Attorney Robert Hur, pictured above in September, said Merrill's web of lies ruined the lives of his investors, leaving many devastated\n\nParadise then addressed Merrill directly, telling him: 'When I step out of this courthouse today, my heart and my conscience will be completely clear. You will be flushed away because you're not going to steal my willingness and my ability to see the good in people.'\n\nA couple in their 70s flew in from Baton rouge, Louisiana, to confront Merrill, who stole $2million in retirement income from them.\n\nLiz Oyer, Merrill's federal public defender, said her client has taken responsibility for his actions.\n\nWhen given a chance to speak, a teary-eyed Merrill admitted to failing the people who had put their trust in him and causing financial loss to business associates and friends. He appealed to the judge for mercy.\n\n'I will work diligently to repay those I've harmed,' he continued. 'I want to apologize to my parents my friends my wife and children for causing them embarrassment and shame. I also want to apologize to the people who came forward today. To see their pain and anger is something I'll never forget.'\n\nUS District Judge Richard Bennett marveled aloud at what he characterized as the defendant's 'astonishing' level greed and lambasted him for having the audacity to think that he could lie to the FBI, reported the Baltimore Sun.\n\n'You were on your way to becoming the next Bernie Madoff,' the later told Merrill. 'Another 11 years, and you would have been.'\n\nMadoff, a former New York financier and investment adviser, is currently serving a 150-year prison sentence for carrying out the world's largest ever Ponzi scheme to the tune of $64.8billion.\n\nMerrill could have faced up to 40 years in prison. The prosecution asked the judge to hand down a 32-year sentence, while the defense asked for 10 years.\n\nMerrill's wife on Wednesday pleaded guilty to to a felony count of conspiring to remove property and obstruct justice.\n\nShe was caught emptying cash from a safe at her husband's $11million vacation home on the Florida Gulf Coast as Merrill awaited trial behind bars and their lavish lifestyle was ripped away by federal investigators.\n\nAmanda wiped away tears as she entered her plea under a deal with prosecutors, who have asked the judge to give her 12 months on house arrest at her sentencing in January so she can take care of her children, aged one and two.\n\nOutside the courtroom, US Attorney Hur called Kevin and Amanda Merrill 'wealthy, privileged people who are trying to beat the system'.\n\n'When a federal judge issues an order to freeze assets, you have to obey that order,' Hur said, according to the Baltimore Sun. 'You better heed that warning.'\n\nAmanda, 30, pleaded guilty a felony charge of conspiring to remove property and obstruct justice in US District Court in Baltimore on Wednesday. She was caught emptying cash from a safe at her husband's $11million vacation home in Naples, Florida (pictured) as her husband awaited trial behind bars and their lavish lifestyle was ripped away by federal investigators\n\nGovernment lawyers with the Securities and Exchange Commission had filed restraining orders to bar Amanda from her husband's assets after he was indicted in September 2018.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, agents raided the couple's home in Towson and seized jewelry, his watch collection, cars, and over $520,000 in cash, mostly from a safe.\n\nUnder the indictment, Kevin was ordered to forfeit $39million, six real estate properties, 25 cars, a boat, an interest in an aircraft, an insurance policy, and jewelry, according to a news release from the US Attorney's Office in Maryland.\n\nLess than a month after Kevin's arrest, Amanda traveled to the couple's home in Naples, Florida, and used instructions her husband had given her during recorded jail phone calls to open the safe and removed $15,000.\n\nShe brought the cash, along with other items from the property, back to Maryland and told her attorney that she had found the safe unlocked and empty.\n\nProsecutors submitted to the court a transcript of one of the prison calls wherein Kevin coached his wife on how to open the safe, covertly referring to it as 'the restaurant'.\n\nA federal prosecutor said Merrill also reminded his wife of their $150,000 fine-wine collection, instructing her: 'take the good wine out of the subzeros and replace it with the crappy wine from the basement.'\n\nAmanda also redeemed the points on her husbands American Express business credit card - which had been frozen by the government - and received 127 gift cards worth $26,075 for retail businesses such as Target, Home Depot, Nordstrom, Sephora, and Starbucks.\n\nIn early November 2018, FBI Special Agents executed search warrants at the Merrill homes in Towson and Naples.\n\nAt the Towson home, they found approximately $15,378 in cash, half in Amanda's purse and the rest in a closet drawer.\n\nAt the Naples home, they used a transcript of the jail call to open the safe, which was empty.\n\nKevin Merrill was indicted in September 2018 and ordered to forfeit $39million, six real estate properties (five pictured), 25 cars, a boat and other assets\n\nIn November 2018, FBI agents executed search warrants at the Merrills' home in Towson (pictured), where they found $15,378 in cash - half in Amanda's purse and the rest in a closet\n\nUnited States Attorney Robert Hur is seen speaking at a news conference about the indictment of Kevin Merrill and his associates on September 19, 2018, in Washington, DC\n\nThe Justice Department released photos of two of the luxury vehicles Merrill was ordered to forfeit under the September 2018 indictment. The government is now working to repay investors defrauded in the Ponzi scheme by selling the many lavish items seized\n\nKevin Merrill's business partner, Jay Ledford, 54, of Texas and Nevada, pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering in June and is scheduled for sentencing next month.\n\nA third man, Cameron Jezierski, 28, of Fort Worth, Texas, was indicted for wire fraud after prosecutors said he helped the men create fake paperwork.\n\nThe fraudsters' Ponzi scheme led more than 200 investors to believe they were buying 'consumer debt portfolios', bundles of debt on student loans, credit cards and car loans.\n\nInstead, the partners were transferring money from new investors to old ones and pocketing millions along the way.\n\nProsecutors estimated that the investors - which included investment groups, retirees, small-business owners, doctors, and former NBA and NHL players - lost $189million in the scheme.\n\nThe government is now working to repay the investors by selling the many lavish items seized from the fraudsters.\n\nMerrill's mansion in Ruxton was sold for $2.75million; his Bugatti Veyron sports car for $930,000; and his 2018 Bowrider Port Cruiser yacht for $300,000.", "description": "Disgraced investment adviser Kevin Merrill, 54, tearfully apologized to his victims and family before a judge handed down the sentence, after likening him to the most notorious Ponzi schemer in history.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19557528-0-image-a-33_1570739709500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
