Using anything more than a single word or \u201cvery short extracts\u201d of an article would require payment.\n\nOffering no snippets of the story means Google can avoid paying fees to publishers, unless it gets permission to show them for free.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pay for links to be included in search results,\u201d Richard Gingras, Google\u2019s vice president of news, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cDoing so would not only skew the options we might provide but it would ultimately undermine the trust users have in how search and news work on Google.\u201d\n\nThe EU copyright directive was aimed at giving writers and artists more protection of their creative rights and incomes. News companies, concerned about maintaining quality journalism, had pushed for the reform amid slumping revenue at traditional media organizations.\n\nBut tech companies and digital rights campaigners criticized it over worries it would lead to censorship. Google had lobbied strongly against the directive, saying that removing previews would lead to a drop in traffic to publishers\u2019 websites.\n\n___\n\nFor all of AP\u2019s tech coverage, visit https://apnews.com/apf-technology\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Google said Wednesday it will tweak how it shows previews for news stories in France but won't pay license fees to publishers when the country brings in new European Union copyright rules.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kelvin Chan"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
