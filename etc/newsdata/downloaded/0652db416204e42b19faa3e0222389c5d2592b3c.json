REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nThe unsolicited takeover offer is not expected to succeed given a preference among LSE investors for the exchange to complete its $27 billion proposed acquisition of data and analytics group Refinitiv, the source close to the LSE said.\n\nThe exchange wants to focus on executing that deal, rather than risk it being derailed by the Hong Kong bourse, the source said. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing\u2019s (HKEX) offer requires the LSE to ditch the Refinitiv deal.\n\nBut a person close to the Hong Kong exchange said a rejection of an initial approach was common in takeovers and HKEX was already considering its next step.\n\nInformal discussions between HKEX and LSE shareholders have begun, the person added.\n\nAn LSE spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe proposed deal, announced on Wednesday, aims to create an exchange powerhouse spanning Asia and Europe which would be better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc and CME Group inc.\n\nHowever shares in HKEX fell more than 3% on Thursday as investors raised concerns about the political and regulatory risks involved in its move to take over one of Britain\u2019s marquee financial institutions.\n\nThe indicative offer also got a cool response in London, where LSE shares finished up 5.9% on Wednesday, far short of the proposed takeover\u2019s implied premium.\n\nDaunting political and technical challenges to the deal have already surfaced.\n\nOne major sticking point is the requirement for the LSE to abandon its acquisition of financial information provider Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone and Thomson Reuters, the parent of Reuters News.\n\nThat deal, which went public in late July, caused LSE\u2019s shares to leap 15% on hopes Refinitiv\u2019s business would boost its long-term profitability. LSE said in a statement on Wednesday that it remained committed to the Refinitiv deal.\n\nHKEX has 28 days to make a firm bid for the LSE, whose shares were up 0.3% at 7,226 pence at 1046 GMT on Thursday, or walk away for six months.\n\nThe source close to the LSE said that while the Hong Kong deal offered a gateway into China\u2019s economy, the LSE had already just established its own entry point with a recently launched stock market link with Shanghai.\n\nA separate source close to the LSE said HKEX executives met with LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer in London on Monday, just two days before they made the proposal public.\n\nPROTESTS AND POLITICAL RISK\n\nAnalysts said a perception that Beijing is exerting growing influence over Hong Kong could become another key sticking point for an LSE takeover, given the Hong Kong government\u2019s close links with the HKEX.\n\nFitch Ratings said that \u201cincreasing control by Chinese authorities over Hong Kong\u201d could raise regulatory concerns in Britain and the United States about data and information security.\n\nHong Kong is entering a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by legislation that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system.\n\nThe government\u2019s handling of the protests has been criticised internationally, as has the political pressure applied by Beijing to Kong companies not to support the pro-democracy movement.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways was ordered to suspend staff who were involved in or supported the demonstrations.\n\nThe Hong Kong government is the biggest shareholder in HKEX, with a 6% stake. It approves six of the 13 board members and can also stop any other shareholding rising above 5%.\n\n\u201cThe transaction will require various regulatory approvals, which will stress-test the world\u2019s understanding of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 constitution,\u201d said David Blennerhassett, an independent analyst writing on the SmartKarma research platform.\n\n\u201cIt will be politically tough now and in the near-term to get this through various regulatory channels.\u201d\n\nHKEX DOWNGRADE\n\nAnalysts said HKEX\u2019s share price fall reflected scepticism the approach would succeed and investor concern about the dilutive impact of the cash-and-shares offer.\n\n\u201cIf the market thought the deal was going to go ahead, I would have expected the shares to have fallen by more than 3%, typically that\u2019s what we\u2019d expect for an acquirer in a deal like this,\u201d said Michael Wu, analyst at Morningstar.\n\nUnder the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. HKEX said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE if the deal went through.\n\nCitigroup downgraded HKEX to \u2018sell\u2019 from \u2018buy\u2019, saying the acquisition price was high and could \u201cadd downward pressure\u201d to the exchange\u2019s shares and valuation. Regulatory hurdles for the deal were also high, it said in its research note.\n\nSome analysts, however, said they could see strategic logic in HKEX\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cWe believe that bringing the largest listed exchanges in Asia and Europe together could create new revenue streams and a lot depends on how well HKEX can capitalise on this,\u201d Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Jonas Kan wrote in a research report.\n\n($1 = 0.8110 pounds)", "description": "The London Stock Exchange's board will meet in coming days to make a decision on the Hong Kong bourse's surprise $39 billion takeover proposal, a source close to the British company said on Thursday, as the market poured cold water on the deal.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hughes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429062499&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B10P", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
