Many have not been surprised by the reports, meanwhile others have backed up the idea that it\u2019s okay for Irving to take some much-needed mental space during the course of a busy NBA calendar year.\n\nSeveral of Irving\u2019s teammates have refuted the idea that Irving has been an issue already, including DeAndre Jordan. Spencer Dinwiddie even went so far as to wager a guess as to who leaked this information to the press, saying it was Daryl Morey and the Houston Rockets\u2019 front office.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNow, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson has weighed in on the whole debacle, and he\u2019s on the side of his superstar.\n\nVia Twitter:\n\nNets coach Kenny Atkinson said, from his perspective, the notion that Kyrie Irving\u2019s mood swings are a concern among Brooklyn team officials is totally false. https://t.co/Q1ZdFEIQpE \u2014 Ian Begley (@IanBegley) October 29, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nIrving has a reputation, and there seems to be some reticence to give him the benefit of the doubt. That\u2019s probably due to the nature in which Irving has conducted himself in the past, which it hasn\u2019t always jived with the money or social position he\u2019s demanded on previous teams.\n\nWhatever the case, it was unlikely that things were going to be smooth sailing with Irving in Brooklyn. He\u2019s a galaxy brain-level thinker at times, and the hope is that won\u2019t affect how he plays on the court. This season is just a trial run or things are going to go next year with Kevin Durant, so the stakes aren\u2019t super high.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll anyone wants is for things not to blow up with the Nets before Durant has a chance to step on the court. Whether these reports of Irving causing trouble are truth or subterfuge, we will soon find out as the rest of the regular season unfolds in Brooklyn.", "description": "Irving has a reputation, and there seems to be some reticence to give him the benefit of the doubt.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/P6oYMPXmuxziGhQMsvs3lQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FBr1HF2Qb5y9GPC5ILSedA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/358576e1d0d2e60e399621859718bc9c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
