Photo: courtesy of the retailer\n\nIt\u2019s not always clear what Amazon carries when it comes to the things-to-hang-on-your-wall department. (There\u2019s a lot of stuff like this.) But if you know what to search for and where to look, there are actually some fabulous posters and prints \u2014 26 of which we\u2019ve gathered below.\n\n\u201cSwimming Pool, August 28, 1958\u201d by O. Winston Link Photographer O. Winston Link spent a good part of the late 1950s traveling through small southern towns, documenting the steam engine\u2019s last hurrah and the major role it played in people\u2019s lives. This image is of a group of friends hanging out by a swimming pool as a train zooms by, and it feels so \u201950s. $45 at Amazon Buy $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nDesign Is One: The Vignellis 2012 U.S. One-Sheet Poster Forget a vintage subway map: How about a poster from the movie about the person who designed the subway map? This poster is for Design Is One, the documentary about renowned designer couple Massimo and Lella Vignelli. $55 at Amazon Buy $55 at Amazon Buy\n\nHilma af Klint, \u201cWee Blue Coo\u201d Poster, Framed $30 is an excellent price for a framed poster of a painting by Hilma af Klint, the early-20th-century Swedish painter who is the subject of a much-Instagrammed exhibit at the Guggenheim. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nAlexander Calder \u201cStabiles\u201d Lithograph There are few things more elegant than Alexander Calder\u2019s Galerie Maeght exhibit posters. This one\u2019s from a show of his signature \u201cstabiles.\u201d $45 at Amazon Buy $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Parachute Jump at the World\u2019s Fair $35 (was $60, now 42% off) Actual parachutes were held up by metal rings on this famous ride that made its debut during the 1939 World\u2019s Fair. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nMilton Glaser \u201cBig Nudes\u201d Poster Milton Glaser (one of the co-founders of New York) created this poster in 1968 for a show of \u201cBig Nudes\u201d at the Visual Arts Gallery. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nFlorida Grapefruit and Oranges Poster $24 (was $25, now 4% off) We actually discovered the origins of this amazing (and odd) poster advertising grapefruits and oranges: The Yiddish was meant to attract Jews living in Florida in the 1940s. How excellent is the exclamation point? $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nEdith Wharton House of Mirth 1905 Poster Print This poster features an illustration from the first edition of Edith Wharton\u2019s classic House of Mirth. The quote at the bottom \u2014 \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to remember my existence nowadays\u201d \u2014 is something Mrs. Trenor says to Lily. Very angsty and teen-bedroom appropriate. $66 at Amazon Buy $66 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Strategist is a new site designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
