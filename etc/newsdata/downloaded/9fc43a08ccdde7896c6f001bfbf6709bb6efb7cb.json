REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\n\u201cSIGNIFICANT GAPS\u201d\n\nJohnson has repeatedly said he will seek to strike a deal at the EU summit to remove the Irish border backstop, an insurance agreement to prevent the return of border controls between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. British lawmakers fear the backstop will lock the United Kingdom into the EU\u2019s orbit for years to come.\n\nThe European Union would respond positively if the British government shifts its position in Brexit talks in the coming weeks, Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said.\n\nBut Coveney said that there were \u201csignificant gaps\u201d between British proposals and what Ireland and the EU would consider. He said the threat of a no-deal Brexit might help make the British debate \u201cmore honest\u201d.\n\nBelfast\u2019s High Court dismissed on Thursday a case arguing that a British exit from the European Union without a withdrawal agreement would contravene Northern Ireland\u2019s 1998 peace accord.\n\nJohnson said the government is waiting to hear an appeal next week against the Scottish court ruling by the Supreme Court, the United Kingdom\u2019s highest judicial body, and he respected the independence of the judges.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nLast week, the High Court of England and Wales rejected a similar challenge by campaigners, saying it was a political not a judicial matter.\n\n\u201cIndeed, as I say, the High Court in England plainly agrees with us, but the Supreme Court will have to decide,\u201d Johnson said. Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on the ruling, saying it is a matter for the government.\n\nBut the publication of the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit scenario prompted calls from Labour and other opposition parties for parliament to be recalled.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday denied lying to Queen Elizabeth over the reasons for suspending the British parliament after a court ruled his decision was unlawful and opponents called for lawmakers to be recalled to discuss Brexit.", "authors": ["Andrew Macaskill", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429009704&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0KQ", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
