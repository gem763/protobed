All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201c[President Donald Trump] is getting his due process, lynching victims did not.\u201d Carol Anderson, a professor of African American history at Emory University told ABC News.\n\nAnderson said she was completely \"shocked and appalled\" by his use of the word which prompted her own response to the president on Twitter.\n\n\"You weren't castrated & forced to eat your genitalia like Claude Neal. You weren't dragged behind a car, doused w/gasoline & set on fire like Cleo Wright. You weren't blow torched until your eyes popped out of your head like John Jones. That's lynching. You get due process,\" she tweeted.\n\nThe Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe \u2018absolute terror\u2019 of lynching\n\nLynching is defined by Merriam Webster as \"to put to death (as by hanging) by mob action without legal approval or permission.\u201d\n\nThere were at least 4,743 lynchings in the United States between 1882 and 1968 -- almost three-quarters of the victims were black, according to the NAACP. However, Latinos, Jewish and Italian Americans and other immigrant groups were also lynched during periods of racial tension as minorities moved into traditionally white communities of north-Western European ancestry.\n\nAnderson noted that the majority of lynchings happened during Reconstruction -- just after slaves were freed -- through the rise of the Jim Crow era laws which codified racial segregation. The acts, which even continued through the civil rights era into the modern age have been used as a way to terrorize black people \u201cback into their place\u201d now that they were no longer enslaved, Anderson said.\n\n\u201cHow do you put them back into a neo-slavery place? The Jim Crow laws were one mechanism, outright massive domestic terror was the other mechanism,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nLynchings were often public outings and were announced in churches. White families would pack a picnic lunch and come out to watch the torture, beatings, burning, hanging, mutilation and eventual murder of helpless and innocent individuals.\n\nIn one case, for example in 1918, a young black woman named Mary Turner, who was eight months pregnant, was stripped naked, turned upside down, doused with gasoline and set on fire. Her unborn child was removed from her stomach and stomped to death by an angry white mob--all because Turner was outraged at the murder of her husband by that same mob after he was one of many falsely accused of killing a white plantation owner.\n\nEmmett Till was 14-years-old when he was kidnapped, brutally beaten and killed in 1955, hours after he was falsely accused of whistling at a white woman. His body was found mutilated days later in a river in Mississippi. An all-white jury later acquitted two white men of murder charges.\n\nChicago Tribune via AP\n\nLynching in the eyes of the law\n\nWhile murder in and of itself was not legal, the issue of lynching was complicated by the fact that the law did not consider blacks deserving of equal legal protections and thus authorities did not work to protect minorities targeted by racial violence, Anderson said.\n\n\u201cPeople should begin to think about the kind of terror that factions throughout a community where you can have that kind of lawlessness,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nOver more than a century, Congress has tried with more than 200 failed bills to make lynching a federal crime.\n\nIn December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed legislation that would finally make lynching a federal crime. Authored by 2020 presidential candidates New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only African American Republican in that chamber, the Justice for Lynching Act characterized lynching as, \u201cthe ultimate expression of racism in the United States,\u201d and classifies it as a federal hate crime.\n\n\u201cToday is an emotional and historic day,\u201d Booker said after its Senate passage. \u201cFor over a century, members of Congress have attempted to pass some version of a bill that would recognize lynching for what it is: a bias-motivated act of terror. And for more than a century, and more than 200 attempts, this body has failed. Today, we have righted that wrong and taken corrective action that recognizes this stain on our country\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe House is slated to next take up the measure.\n\nRep. Bobby Rush, founder of the Black Panther Party's Illinois chapter, told ABC News that his great-uncle was lynched.\n\n\"The pain and horror of that is right beneath the surface,\" Rush said. \"It's not something you can ever walk away from.\"\n\nRush has also introduced an anti-lynching bill in the House of Representatives, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which would make lynching a federal crime subject to a prison term, a fine, or both. Since June, his bill has been in markup in the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary committee.\n\nIn the meantime, lynching is still not considered a federal crime as neither bills have been signed into law.\n\nHow the word has been used politically in the past\n\nThe danger in politicizing and using the word lynching out of context is that it begins to lose its value and its dark history begins to erode according to political experts.\n\nLibrary of Congress\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the first person to politicize the term lynching.\n\nThen-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas during his Senate confirmation hearing where he was confronted by Anita Hill on allegations of sexual harassment called the proceedings \u201ca high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. -- U.S. Senate, rather than hung from a tree.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden in October 1998 said that the impeachment of President Bill Clinton could be seen as \"partisan lynching.\"\n\n\"Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense,\" Biden said in an appearance on CNN.\n\nBiden issued an apology tweeting, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that. Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.\u201d\n\nIn September, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz referred to Democratic outcry about Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky -- which sparked the impeachment inquiry -- as a \u201clynch mob.\u201d\n\nFollowing his Tuesday morning tweet, there was some bipartisan outcry.\n\nThe House's top Republican, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., a frequent Trump defender, said he would not have used such language.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with that language,\u201d he said to reporters. \u201cPretty simple.\u201d\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said the word referred to a \u201cpainful scourge in our history\u201d and called on Trump to retract his statement.\n\nWe can all disagree on the process, and argue merits. But never should we use terms like \u201clynching\u201d here. The painful scourge in our history has no comparison to politics, and @realDonaldTrump should retract this immediately. May God help us to return to a better way. https://t.co/URKNgxUfiv \u2014 Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cWe can all disagree on the process, and argue merits.

May God help us to return to a better way,\u201d Kinzinger tweeted.\n\nRush harshly responding via Twitter said, \u201cDo you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d\n\nHowever, there were some lawmakers that came to the president's defense, agreeing with his use and characterization of the word.\n\nGOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said the president\u2019s use of the word in a tweet was \u201cpretty well accurate\u201d in describing what he feels Democrats in Congress are doing to the president by launching an impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cThis is a lynching in every sense,\u201d Graham said, defending the president. \u201cThis is un-American.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think lynching can be seen as somebody taking the law into their own hands and out to get somebody for no good reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does lynching mean? When a mob grabs you, they don\u2019t give you a chance to defend yourself. They don\u2019t tell you what happened to you. They just destroy you,\u201d Graham went on to say.\n\n\"We can not allow someone who sits in the highest office, such as Trump, to use this word so casually and cavalierly without to regurgitation and repudiation,\" Rush said.\n\nImani Perry, a professor of race and African American culture at Princeton University, said that the comparison of an impeachment proceedings and lynching is \u201cabsolutely absurd\u201d and that Trump has been \u201cgiven the grace of the most deliberate and respectful of processes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the issue for me goes beyond his offensively flippant reference to one of the most shameful aspects of our history,\u201d Perry said in a statement to ABC News. \u201cIt speaks to his complete misunderstanding of what it means to actually confront injustice and unfairness as he sits on a self involved perch that is miles away from the lives of Americans of all sorts.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump's reference to lynching resurrects the painful U.S. history of racially motivated killings.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/lynching-rope-gty-ps-191023_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
