Pretty much every second of free time that I had, I was doing coke. I couldn't control it. I didn't want to control it.'\n\nThe New York native ended up at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas after the alarming incident.\n\nHe recalled having a wake-up call while 'trapped all day' in his thoughts at the Nevada medical center.\n\nInspiration: The ex husband of Khloe Kardashian, 39, and his pro partner Peta Murgatroyd was voted off the ballroom show off after falling in the bottom two with Queer Eye star Karamo Brown\n\n'I was laying there in that bed, hooked up to all these machines, people all around me crying, and there was no running from it anymore. It was like God was telling me, 'Whatever the f*** you think you're doing, you need to slow down. Or it's gonna be worse than this,'' he said.\n\nWhile Lamar admitted to initially using coke to numb the pain of losing loved ones, he explained he wasn't doing drugs on a daily basis until the death of his infant son Jayden.\n\nIn 2006, the six-month-old passed away from sudden infant death syndrome.\n\n'I think everything probably picked up at that point, with the drugs. Even subconsciously. You don't even know why you're doing it at that point. I think subconsciously, you make yourself an addict because of the trauma that you're going through,' the father confessed.\n\nCandid: The star said: 'I'm lucky to be walking and talking, so this is just another hill I've had to climb'\n\nThank you: Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli voted for Karamo and his dance partner Jenna Johnson, cementing Lamar's exit from the competition\n\nThe two-time NBA champ expressed that he felt invincible up until the point he wound up in a coma.\n\n'When you\u2019re an addict, nothing can get through to you. I never thought I was going to die. I never thought I\u2019d be in a coma. I didn\u2019t think I had a problem. But then I woke up in a bed with tubes coming out of my mouth \u2014 and it was real,' he admitted.\n\n'Nobody is untouchable. Nobody in this life is immune to pain,' he continued.\n\nIn the wake of his nearly fatal overdose, Lamar explained that his surviving children, Destiny, 20, and Lamar Jr., 18, are 'the only things that kept [him] going.'\n\nOnce the ailing athlete had regained his ability to talk, his daughter inspired him to go to rehab under the threat of cutting off communication.\n\n'The doctors told me that right before I woke up from the coma, my kids had come by to see me. And that broke my heart, because I had seen my own mother on her deathbed, with tubes coming out of her mouth,' he said.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks alum explained that he's currently clean, but is still facing constant urges.\n\n'I\u2019m sober now. But it\u2019s an everyday struggle. I have an addiction. I\u2019ll always have an addiction. It never goes away. I mean, I want to get high right now. But I know that I can\u2019t if I want to be here for my children,' he said", "description": "Lamar Odom reflected on his near-fatal 2015 overdose as he was eliminated from Dancing With The Stars on Monday.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/19436144-0-image-a-17_1570527553452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
