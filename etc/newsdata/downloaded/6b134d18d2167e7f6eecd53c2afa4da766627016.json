He would also direct that all new Defense Department facilities and non-combat vehicles be net-zero emissions by 2025.\n\nHe also wants to issue \u201cClimate Action Bonds\u201d to help pay for clean energy and resilience projects; his plan likened them to World War II-era war bonds.\n\nMr. Buttigieg would establish a National Catastrophic Extreme Weather Insurance (CEWI) program where certain families that experience climate change-related disruptions could purchase federally-subsidized catastrophic insurance.\n\nHis plan includes a \u201cprice\u201d on carbon that would automatically increase each year, and imposes a border tax on imports from countries that don\u2019t have their own form of carbon tax.\n\nHe also plans to sign an executive order mandating any new material the federal government uses or pays for to build infrastructure meets certain carbon emissions standards.\n\nMr. Buttigieg released his plan as he and other presidential candidates are set to participate in a \u201cclimate crisis\u201d town hall in New York on Wednesday hosted by CNN.\n\nOther candidates who have released their own plans to tackle climate change in recent days include former Obama administration official Juli\u00e1n Castro, Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
