Trysta Krick recaps it all and looks ahead to the epic finale. USA TODAY\n\nHow will this year's World Series play out? Using the Dynasty League Baseball online simulation, USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner and DLB designer Mike Cieslinski will pre-play each game to provide some insight into the key matchups and strategy fans can expect to see in the Fall Classic.\n\nGame 7: Washington Nationals at Houston Astros\n\nOf all the amazing, breath-taking, crazy, unbelievable ways a World Series could end, Game 7 of USA TODAY's annual Simulated World Series outdid even the wildest imagination.\n\nThe Washington Nationals withstood a heart-stopping rally by the Houston Astros to tie the game in the bottom of the ninth, then got a clutch, go-ahead two-run home run from Juan Soto in the top of the 11th for a 13-10 victory and the Sim Series title.\n\nBOX SCORE:Nationals 13, Astros 10\n\nThe game had so many twists and turns as Houston took the lead in the seventh off Nationals lefty Patrick Corbin on Carlos Correa's two-run single and went up 8-6 on Yordan Alvarez's RBI double.\n\nBut the Nats came right back with Anthony Rendon's three-run double in the eighth to take a 10-8 lead.\n\nIn the ninth, Washington closer Daniel Hudson gave up back-to-back homers to Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel \u2014 the latter one a mammoth 516-foot shot onto the train tracks in left field.\n\nAfter a scoreless 10th, Juan Soto followed Anthony Rendon's walk with a 394-foot shot of his own to right field \u2014 his second homer of the game \u2014 to give the Nats a lead they would not relinquish.\n\nA screenshot of Juan Soto's go-ahead two-run home run in the top of the 11th inning in Game 7 of USA TODAY's annual Simulated World Series. (Photo: Dynasty League Baseball)\n\nIn spring training of 2018, shortly after he was hired, manager Dave Martinez had a live camel show up at Washington's spring training facility to symbolize the team's ultimate goal of getting \"over the hump\" and finally winning a postseason series.\n\nAppropriately, on a Wednesday, the Nationals did just that.\n\nFULL PLAY-BY-PLAY:Nationals outlast Astros in 11 innings\n\nSoto finished the seven games with a .375 average, five home runs and nine RBI and was named the Sim Series MVP. The Nationals were three outs away from losing the series in five games, but Soto's solo home run in the bottom of the ninth in Game 5 tied the score, kept his team alive and helped propel the Nats to the first of three consecutive wins they needed to stage their stunning comeback.\n\nPrevious Sim Series results\n\nGAME 1: Astros 4, Nationals 0\n\nGAME 2: Astros 10, Nationals 2\n\nGAME 3: Nationals 4, Astros 1\n\nGAME 4: Astros 5, Nationals 3\n\nGAME 5: Nationals 4, Astros 3 (10 innings)\n\nGAME 6:Nationals 1, Astros 0\n\nWhat to watch in (the actual) Game 7\n\n\u2014 Pitchers taxed to the max: The Simulated Series engine had no idea Max Scherzer was going start Game 7, but interestingly it did predict Scherzer would suffer an injury when he started Game 5. With Scherzer taken off the roster, the Nationals turned to Anibal Sanchez \u2014 who still could play an important role in Game 7.\n\nHe pitched a gem in Sim Series Game 3, holding the Astros to three hits and one run over 7 1/3 innings. And he was reasonably effective in his second start. Sanchez was one of the best pitchers in the majors at limiting hard contact during the regular season at 31.6%. If Scherzer can't pitch deep into the actual Game 7, Sanchez figures to be the first arm out of the Washington bullpen.\n\n\u2014 Astros' MVP: Alex Bregman hit just .192 for the Sim Series, but when his team needed him to come through in the clutch, he did. Bregman's solo homer in the ninth was his third of the series and it kept the Astros' hopes alive against Nats closer Daniel Hudson.\n\n\u2014 All hands on deck: With no worries about there being a next game, both managers will take every opportunity they can to get an advantage \u2014 at any point in the game. The Nationals used 17 of their 25 players and the Astros used 19. Houston starter Zack Greinke only pitched 2 2/3 innings before he was pulled for Brad Peacock. There's no margin for error, so expect the managerial wheels to turn throughout Game 7.\n\n\u2014 Relievers come up big: It seems odd to say in a 13-10 game, but there were some impressive pitching performances out of the bullpen. Astros closer Roberto Osuna tossed 2 1/3 hitless, scoreless innings after taking over in the ninth.\n\nWashington's Tanner Rainey got the biggest outs of the game after entering in the 10th with a runner on first. Pinch-runner Kyle Tucker stole second to put the winning run in scoring position with one out, but Rainey struck out both Jose Altuve and Bregman to end the threat. He then pitched a scoreless ninth to secure the win.\n\nSimulate your own World Series.
