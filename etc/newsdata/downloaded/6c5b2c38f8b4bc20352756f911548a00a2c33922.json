But I don\u2019t think everyone can look like Chris Hemsworth,\u2019 she told Metro.co.uk.\n\nHe\u2019s beauty and he\u2019s grace (Picture: Chris Hemsworth/Instagram)\n\n\u2018And do you want to look like Chris? First of all he\u2019s six foot, he\u2019s huge. If you\u2019re five-foot-two you\u2019re not going to look like Chris, you\u2019re not going to grow!\n\n\u2018We need to put things in perspective and draw inspiration from them. What they do beautifully, is they set goals and they work hard. They don\u2019t laze around.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ll leave the hard work to them TBH.\n\n\u2018That hurt so much\u2019 (Picture: Chris Hemsworth/Instagram)\n\nMeanwhile, as if all the workouts weren\u2019t enough, Chris has been fancying himself as a casting agent after he decided that he and his Avengers work husbands Robert Downey Jr (Tony Stark) and Chris Evans (Captain America) would make a cracking Three Amigos for the remake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, he\u2019s after his brothers Liam and Luke joining him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nYou never know.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
