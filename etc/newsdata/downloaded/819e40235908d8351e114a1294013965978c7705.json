The party is still waiting to confirm Elizabeth Warren, said CDP spokesperson Roger Salazar.\n\nAll Democratic candidates were invited to attend, though the Univision forum is limited to eight candidates due to time constraints, Salazar said.\n\nBiden\u2019s team has announced he will be in California the day before the convention \u2014 but has also said that he plans to head to Washington state on the first day of the Long Beach event expected to draw more than 5,000 California party activists.\n\nHe previously missed a state party convention in June and a summer Democratic National Committee meeting in August, both of which were in San Francisco and drew most 2020 hopefuls to California.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why he\u2019s passing on the Long Beach convention. The Biden campaign did not respond immediately to requests for comment from POLITICO.\n\nBiden drew criticism from many in the party\u2019s grassroots ranks when he missed the state party convention in June, where a dozen 2020 hopefuls appeared. His absence handed Sanders an opportunity to deliver a veiled jab from the podium when he referenced \u201cthose who have chosen for whatever reason not to be in this room\u201d as Democrats talk about \u201cthe best way forward,\" to beat Trump.\n\nThe former VP\u2019s supporters said at the time that it was no surprise that Biden bypassed the events in San Francisco, one of the nation\u2019s most liberal bastions, where progressives might have directed boos and jeers at him. They said he would better boost his campaign through events and fundraisers with more moderate supporters than the most dedicated party activists, who tend to skew left.\n\nThe upcoming convention, however, is in Long Beach \u2014 still a Democratic stronghold but less liberal than San Francisco.", "description": "Rusty Hicks thanked Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Beto O'Rourke and Andrew Yang for agreeing to appear.", "authors": ["Carla Marinucci"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ca/c0/606ccfdb4721bd8457a981c79986/joe-biden-is-pictured-getty.%20Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
