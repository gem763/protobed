Buying parts lets you tailor the meal to their tastes.\n\nFor dark meat aficionados, go for a mixture of drumsticks and bone-in thighs. For those who prefer white meat, a pack of bone-in breasts will do just fine. Figure on two or three pieces per person, plus leftovers because cold fried chicken eaten the next day is fantastic.\n\nA whole chicken of 3 or 4 pounds can be cut into 10 parts for frying: two drumsticks, two thighs, two wings and the two breasts each cut in two, with the backbone discarded. This will feed four people nicely. (Here\u2019s a video demonstrating how to do that.)\n\nBuy the freshest chicken you can at the store, organic if possible.", "description": "For a remarkably simple dish, fried chicken can be controversial. There are debates over brining the meat (yes, you should). People argue over what starch is used to coat the chicken, about the fat used to fry it, about the temperature at which it cooks. But really all you want is what the great Southern chef Bill Neal called \u201cchicken that tastes like chicken, with a crust that snaps and breaks with fragility.\u201d We\u2019ll show you how to get there, and we\u2019ll give you excellent recipes that you can make your own.", "authors": ["Sam Sifton", "A Guide", "Julia Moskin", "Kim Severson", "Melissa Clark", "Tamar Adler", "Mark Bittman", "Julia Reed", "Nigella Lawson", "Martha Rose Shulman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/28/dining/28COOKING-FRIEDCHICKENGUIDE13/28COOKING-FRIEDCHICKENGUIDE13-superJumbo.jpg"}
