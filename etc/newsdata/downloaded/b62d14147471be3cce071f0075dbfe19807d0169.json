Next year, he plans to build a college for paramedics.\n\nThe white-bearded, jovial Opeka, 71, has been called a \u201cliving saint\u201d along the lines of Mother Teresa of Calcutta by many in Madagascar because of his work in one of Africa\u2019s poorest countries. He has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe pope met families living in Akamasoa, one of the first villages built by Opeka on the hills above Madagascar\u2019s capital Antananarivo to re-house people living on the municipal dump in the valley below.\n\n\u201cHere in Akamasoa we have shown that poverty is not an inevitable destiny but something that stems from the lack of social responsibility of politicians who have forgotten and turned their backs on the people who have elected them,\u201d Opeka told the pope in the presence of the country\u2019s president.\n\nAs children sang and danced, Francis, clearly moved by the experience, said the community of neat candy-coloured houses showed it was possible to: \u201csee life in a place that spoke only of death and destruction\u201d.\n\nResidents earn around 50,000 ariary ($13) per week in exchange for breaking rocks by hand or assisting in other construction projects. Children often help on their days off from school.\n\nAll are given a house which they rent at a negligible rate, depending on their circumstances.\n\n\u201cEvery corner of these neighbourhoods, every school or dispensary, is a song of hope that refutes and silences any suggestion that some things are \u2018inevitable\u2019,\u201d Francis said.\n\nMuch of the stone for the buildings is dug from a huge granite quarry where Opeka says Mass three times a year. Opeka, the son of a mason, refers to the pit as \u201cmy cathedral\u201d.\n\nFrancis later visited the quarry and read a prayer for manual workers around the world.", "description": "Pope Francis on Sunday celebrated a former student of his who is now sometimes called Madagascar's \"living saint\" for having changed the lives of thousands of poor people who once lived in garbage dumps.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427665611&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870VE", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
