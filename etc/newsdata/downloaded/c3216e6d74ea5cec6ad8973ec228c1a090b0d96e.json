Here\u2019s what he can expect.\n\nIs Boris Johnson closing in on a Brexit deal?\n\nNo, but there is at least a sense of where a potential solution might lie \u2013 with something that looks a bit like the Northern Ireland-only backstop, rejected by Theresa May and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP).\n\nBoris Johnson has repeatedly mentioned the idea of an all-Ireland zone for agri-foods, citing Ian Paisley\u2019s remark that \u201cour people may be British but our cows are Irish\u201d. That could result in Northern Ireland abiding by EU rules on agriculture, preventing the need for border checks.\n\nBut Dublin has pointed out that this only deals with 30% of the challenge, and border checks of some kind would still be necessary if the UK wants to diverge from EU rules and tariffs in other areas. That\u2019s why the Northern Ireland-only backstop, which would mean regulatory alignment with the EU in other areas, is being talked about again.\n\nSpeaking earlier this week, Johnson rejected the idea, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve seen a bit of chatter about this, stuff in the media \u2026 we will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop. That simply doesn\u2019t work for the UK. We\u2019ve got to come out whole and entire and solve the problems of the Northern Irish border, and I\u2019m absolutely certain that we can do that. But we\u2019re working very, very hard, flat out, to do that.\u201d\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nIs the DUP softening on a Northern Ireland-only backstop?\n\nPublicly they continue to insist they are not softening and a Times story on Friday hinting at a shift in the DUP\u2019s thinking was rejected by the DUP\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, who echoed Johnson\u2019s language, saying the UK must \u201cleave as one nation\u201d.\n\nArlene Foster (@DUPleader) UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that divides the internal market of the UK. We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade. Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories. #frontpages\n\nBut there is no doubt that the government is putting a lot of effort into finding some combination of regulatory alignment, checks away from the border \u2013 at ports and airports \u2013 and democratic consent to satisfy all sides.\n\nWhy are the Brexiters [still] so exercised about the backstop?\n\nFor Johnson and the Vote Leave veterans, with whom he has packed Downing Street, Brexit is only worth doing if the UK can \u201cdiverge\u201d from the EU by setting its own rules. That\u2019s why they want a Canada-style, free-trade deal with the EU27, instead of the closer and more complex relationship May was proposing.\n\nWhile they initially signed off on the December 2017 joint framework that contained the backstop, Johnson, Gove and others came to see it as tying the entire UK into the EU\u2019s regulatory orbit indefinitely. Their test for any new deal will be whether it allows the divergence that they regard as the reason for the whole project in the first place.\n\nAfter a week like this, does the EU even want us to stay? | John Crace Read more\n\nBut that will be exceedingly difficult to reconcile with the DUP\u2019s insistence that there must be no barriers for businesses in Northern Ireland accessing markets in the rest of the UK.\n\nCould Johnson just cut the DUP adrift?\n\nTheresa May patched together a majority in the aftermath of the 2017 general election by striking a confidence-and-supply agreement with the DUP \u2013 helped by an extra \u00a31bn in public funding for Northern Ireland.\n\nThere is an argument doing the rounds in Westminster that since Johnson now has no majority anyway, as has been clearly shown by a string of Commons defeats, and with the confidence-and-supply arrangement up for renewal before the Queen\u2019s speech next month, 10 MPs either way will not make a difference.\n\nBut the numbers in the Commons still look extremely tight for Johnson if he does bring an agreement back next month. And the DUP\u2019s approval would be a strong signal to the Spartans \u2013 the most ardent Brexiters who rejected May\u2019s deal three times \u2013 that a deal was acceptable.", "description": "Potential solution to Brexit deal may lie with idea of Northern Ireland-only backstop", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Jonathan Freedland", "Ell Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1290915a29fd149d3bdb0da46b7963214b18e465/0_64_2308_1384/master/2308.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2f26687c7a42c37c7e24c8adb96e4965", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
