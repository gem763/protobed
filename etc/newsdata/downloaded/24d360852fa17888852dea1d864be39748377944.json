All about the sex position that actually works for everyone Did you know it's not just ONE position?\n\nOh, so you want to mix things up the bedroom, huh? I see you. Sure, you could take the time to test out the many, many gasp-inducing, sweaty, kinky, raunchy positions out there, but you\u2019d probably need to eat and sleep at some point, so\u2026 for the sake of time, let me introduce you to a primo sex-nique: scissoring.\n\nYep, you\u2019ve probably heard of it, and most likely in regard to girl-on-girl action. The sex position-slash-method is often considered the (really, a) go-to way for queer women to have sex, but it\u2019s definitely not the only way they can. Nor is it an off-limits move for anyone else who wants get it on.\n\n\u201cScissoring allows for a very intimate connection,\u201d says Dr Peter Kanaris, psychologist and sex therapist. \u201cThe genital-to-genital contact is very arousing and can enhance not only the physical pleasure, but the emotional arousal as well.\u201d\n\nScissoring is also a unique and exciting position that you and your partner(s) of any gender or orientation can manipulate any way you want so that it feels new every single time. So boring sex? Buh-bye.\n\nHere\u2019s everything to know about what scissoring is and how to do it:\n\n1. Scissoring is pretty much exactly what it sounds like.\n\nWhile scissoring might be new to you, there\u2019s actually nothing new about the move, says Kanaris.\n\nThe position requires that you and your partner lie on your sides and intertwine your legs like two pairs of opened scissors coming together and meeting in the middle. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re in position when your genitals touch. Then, with a little (a lot, actually) grinding and rubbing up against your partner, you\u2019ll well on your way to O Town.\n\n2. You don\u2019t have to lie down to scissor, per se.\n\nThe sky\u2019s the limit when it comes to scissoring and its many adaptations. Once you\u2019ve got the basic lying-down set-up down, you can take things up a notch.\n\n\u201cScissoring can be done in any number of other positions,\u201d says Kanaris. It can be asynchronous, meaning you might lie still while your partner rubs up against you, or you rub up against them while they stay put.\n\nOther times, the grinding might not even take place in between your legs at all. Instead, Kanaris says you could sit on your partner\u2019s lap and rub against their thigh or straddle their torso and rub yourself against their chest. Yup, as long as your legs are, well, split, and you\u2019re swivelling your hips and/or you\u2019re grinding, that\u2019s scissoring.\n\nREAD MORE: How To Give The Best Blow Jobs He\u2019ll Ever Have\n\n3. Scissoring is perfect for \u201coutercourse\u201d.\n\nEver heard of it? Outercourse is when your partner\u2019s genitals (usually, in this case, a penis since it\u2019s an external organ) \u201crests against the genitalia, without penetration,\u201d Kanaris explains.\n\n\u201cThen, with gentle movement and a gradual increase in pressure,\u201d you and your partner can get it on in a whole new way.\n\n4. But it can also involve penetration.\n\nScissoring doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have penetrative fun\u2014whether it\u2019s a finger, toy or penis you want in your vagina, there\u2019s absolutely no reason to leave it out.\n\nIn fact, the beauty of scissoring, unlike the sometimes rushed brand of sex that can comes with typical thrusting, is that it forces you and your partner to slow things down, Kanaris says. So while you get the stimulation of having a body part or sex toy inside you, you also get the arousal of building intimacy.\n\n5. Scissoring invites different muscles to the party.\n\nIf this position and technique isn\u2019t something you\u2019re used to, the new angle will force you to engage different leg and thigh muscles and rely on new gestures so that you and your partner can discover new ways to climax.\n\nSee how many times \u201cnew\u201d showed up in that sentence? That can make sex even more pleasurable, Kanaris promises.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 Great Lubricants For Every Possible Sexy Scenario\n\n6. You might want to stretch a bit before scissoring.\n\nOn that note, if this is your first go, congrats\u2026 but also: Make sure to stretch, because those muscles need a little warm-up.\n\nWhen scissoring, your glutes and thighs are going to be working overtime, and if you\u2019re not loose and limber, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll cramp up, Kanaris warns. If it happens, no biggie\u2026 but it\u2019s not exactly fun and sexy, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for here.\n\n7. Scissoring doesn\u2019t have to happen naked.\n\nWhen penetration isn\u2019t what you\u2019re after\u2014tonight or ever\u2014scissoring opens up the possibility for dry humping\u2014which makes for really hot foreplay and can even sub for actual sex.\n\n8. You can have a different scissoring experience every time.\n\nIf all of the above hasn\u2019t made this clear yet, here\u2019s this: \u201cWith a little imagination, intimate communication and experimentation,\u201d says Kanaris, scissoring can feel like a new move every time you and your partner go for it.\n\nDescribe your fantasy to your partner, ask them what would make them feel good, then test it out. Sure, every variation of scissoring won\u2019t necessarily feel as good as the last\u2014you might even knee your partner on occasion\u2014but it\u2019s this kind of sexcapade that\u2019ll keep the heat between the sheets.\n\n9. You should probably bring lube.\n\nScissoring adds a lot of friction between legs and genitals, and chafing puts a huge damper on an orgasm. Using a little bit of lube can help prevent any raw rubbing (ouch)\u2014and lube just makes sexing better.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s Why You Need To Add A Warming Vibrator To Your Toy Collection\n\n10. You still need to use protection.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re hooking up with a woman and STIs aren\u2019t a concern (as in, you\u2019ve both been tested), then this isn\u2019t so much of a concern. But if you\u2019re scissoring with a guy\u2014and/or with a new partner\u2014Kanaris says to make sure you use condoms (or dental dams). Some STIs can be spread by skin-to-skin contact (yes, even without penetration).\n\n11. Let scissoring be whatever it means to you.\n\nLike any sex act, scissoring doesn\u2019t need to be a defined, black-and-white item that you check off on a to-do list. Scissoring can look and feel however you want it to, so forget any expectations.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get too hung up on, \u2018Oh, am I doing it right?\u2019\u201d Kanaris says. \u201cWhat is right is you and your partner having an enjoyable experience that\u2019s fun and that\u2019s safe.\u201d Preach.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Did you know it's not just ONE position?", "authors": ["Aryelle Siclait"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9330/01204107011a4013abb7c287155772e3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
