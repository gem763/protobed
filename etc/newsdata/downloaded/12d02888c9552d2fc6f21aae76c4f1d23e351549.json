He said that while the deal with FAW lent the credibility he sought for Byton and increased access to suppliers, those benefits came with oversight and interference.\n\nBreitfeld, who recently became the new CEO of struggling EV startup Faraday Future, made the comments during a media event held at Faraday Future\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters on Thursday.\n\nByton took investment from First Auto Works, China\u2019s oldest state-owned automaker\n\nBreitfeld co-founded Byton in 2017 after a long career at BMW where he was in charge of the automaker\u2019s BMW i program. Byton is headquartered in China and has offices in Munich and Silicon Valley. The company showed off a concept SUV at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show where it also announced an ambitious plan to put the vehicle into production by the end of 2019.\n\nTo help make sure that happened, Byton announced last year that it was teaming up with FAW, and this year, it said the state-owned automaker was leading a big investment round that would get the startup\u2019s electric SUV into production.\n\nBut Breitfeld said on Thursday that he \u201cdidn\u2019t realize enough\u201d what it meant to take investment from a state-owned automaker like FAW. He also says FAW took away his responsibilities.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese government enters your company, and takes, to some degree, influence or control, which they did at the end of the day, then things will change,\u201d Breitfeld said. \u201cThey pushed the direction of Byton [to a place that was] not in line with what I thought we should do.\u201d\n\nHave information about Byton?

And he said the state-owned automaker has loaned hundreds of millions more to Byton since then, using the startup\u2019s manufacturing facility in China and other assets as collateral.\n\n\u201cMy feeling is they are going to drive it to a stage where the whole Byton thing will be shut down, they will just keep the plant and the platform,\u201d he said, referring to Byton\u2019s manufacturing facility in Nanjing, China, and the electric technology that powers the startup\u2019s vehicle. Breitfeld also said FAW was approving all of Byton\u2019s expenses and that many on the startup\u2019s engineering team have left the company. \u201cEveryone running the company now is PR and marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe technical guys all left. By the way, in the future you might find them in another place not so far away from myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be very clear though, I don\u2019t want them to fail.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be very clear though, I don\u2019t want them to fail,\u201d Breitfeld added. Breitfeld still has equity in the company, he said, and is still in \u201cnot very friendly\u201d discussions with Byton and FAW over the status of that equity.\n\nA spokesperson for Byton said in an email that \u201cFAW is indeed a major investor, although their stake is smaller than Carsten states and they only hold one seat on the Byton board.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, we have almost 500 employees here at Byton\u2019s R&D center in Santa Clara, the vast majority of them being engineers, with hundreds of additional engineers at the Nanjing R&D center and production facility,\u201d they added.\n\nFAW did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBreitfeld\u2019s co-founder, Daniel Kirchert, has since taken over as CEO of Byton. Kirchert told The Verge earlier this month that Breitfeld\u2019s departure was unexpected.\n\n\u201cThat came as a surprise in April, when he left so suddenly,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish him best for the future and also his new endeavor.\u201d\n\nOn the deal with FAW, Kirchert called it a \u201creally good fit\u201d and said the automaker \u201crespect[s] our independence as a startup.\u201d", "description": "Carsten Breitfeld, a founder and former CEO of EV startup Byton, says he left the company earlier this year because the Chinese government exerted too much influence after an investment from the country\u2019s oldest state-owned automaker, First Auto Works (FAW).", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RzwxlNYb0cQ70bL5J2IYmdLMI2g=/0x180:2500x1489/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10006329/ces_2018_byton_concept_suv_3305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
