This is the start of something that could forever change my district.\"\n\nIn response to Holler's post, the St. Cloud Area School District released a statement that day, seemingly joking about the entire situation.\n\n\"Oops! We goofed,\" it said on Facebook. \"Tried a new menu item today at lunch and we hear it was not a winner! Going forward, we will gather input from our students on new menu options. Thanks for the feedback!\"\n\nSeveral commenters, however, were not amused.\n\n\"'Oops we goofed'? You knew what you were doing and the lack of care going into the children's meals,\" one person wrote. \"When I was in school I completely relied on my at school meal to get by, I'm so grateful that was before they started doing things like this. Those poor kids...\"\n\nOthers were a bit more forgiving.\n\n\"Thank you for acknowledging this,\" another replied. \"Not setting a good example to our students on healthy food choices, not to mention what we pay for this meal...as for there being other option, yes that was true for the first few lunches, but once they ran out of alternative choices- this is what there was. My daughter was 'lucky' to get a different option. Please do better.\"\n\nHoller's viral post comes just weeks after a Mississippi high school similarly came under fire for serving a questionable meal to its students. The school, in that case, stood by its lunch.", "description": "A Minnesota high school is facing\u00a0criticism for serving a meal that many\u00a0people have since called \"ridiculous.\"", "authors": ["Justin Chan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W5Dnd3yNZy7sKv_d6xTAsA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/721x472+0+66/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3a14b5a0-dbda-11e9-b6d5-7850965df85b", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
