As the broadcast ended, Blitzchung shouted \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,\" with the apparent support of the two tournament broadcasters.\n\nBlizzard responded to Blitzchung's comments on October 8 by stripping him of about $3,000 in prize money he had already earned for the tournament, and barred him from \"Hearthstone\" competitions for one year. Blizzard also said it would no longer work with the two broadcasters who were interviewing Blitzchung during his comments. The company deleted the match and interview footage from its official channels as well.\n\nIn the blog post announcing Blitzchung's ban, Blizzard said \"we stand by one's right to express individual thoughts and opinions,\" but Blitzchung's comments were deemed to be harmful to the company.\n\nIn a follow-up statement issued on Friday night, Blizzard said that it was reducing his suspension (and that of the broadcasters) to six months, and restoring his prize money \u2014 though mostly otherwise stood by its earlier positions.\n\nHere's a timeline of Blizzard's terrible week, as fans and politicians expressed their outrage over how the company handled the episode:", "description": "Fans are threatening boycott and protests as Blizzard prepares for its annual fan convention, BlizzCon, on November 1.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0f24fcc4a0a44ca5fa849?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
