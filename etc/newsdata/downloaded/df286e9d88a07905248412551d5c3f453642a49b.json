I was eating very badly and feeling terrible.\n\n\"One day I thought I had pulled a muscle because of pains I was having - then I woke up in the worst pain of my life and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance.\"\n\nLee was in hospital for eight days after developing the condition diverticulitis which had caused a tear in his bowel.\n\nHe said: \"I ended up having four inches of my bowel removed and now have to live with a colostomy bag.\n\n\"The doctors told me the whole situation was brought on by stress - and because of the bad food I was eating, which was all I could get from the foodbank.\"\n\nBut Lee's troubles with benefits and the DWP were set to get even worse.\n\n(Image: James Maloney/Liverpool Echo)\n\nHe added: \"I don't know why but they said it would take three months to sort the extra money - I still haven't had anything.\n\n\"I feel absolutely terrible - I can't get out of the house and have been living on food parcels.\n\n\"The doctors told me I need to have a high fibre diet, but I can't afford any decent food, so I'm worried it is making me more ill.\n\n\"I can't get out of the house, so I need to pay for taxis just to get to the shops or anything.\"\n\nHe said his situation has taken a terrible toll on his physical and mental health.\n\nHe added: \"It is all just getting on top of me and I can't take it anymore.\n\n(Image: James Maloney/Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"I'm sat here in my house and I've literally got nothing except a can of beans.\n\n\"I have been to charities, I have had handouts - I've tried everything but now I have nowhere left to turn.\"\n\n\"It has got so bad - I thought I might not be here at all at some points.\"\n\nA DWP spokesperson said: \u201cMr Strickley receives his full Universal Credit entitlement each month.
