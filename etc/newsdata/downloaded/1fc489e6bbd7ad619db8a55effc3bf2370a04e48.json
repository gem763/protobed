This course of action will give the regulator discretion on the most effective means for companies to meet their duty of care. As currently drafted, the Digital Economy Act does not cover social media platforms.\"\n\nMorgan added that adult content was \"too easily accessed online\" and further action would be needed to protect children online.\n\n\"We are committed to the UK becoming a world-leader in the development of online safety technology and to ensure companies of all sizes have access to, and adopt, innovative solutions to improve the safety of their users,\" she said.\n\n\"This includes age verification tools and we expect them to continue to play a key role in protecting children online.\"\n\nOpen Rights Group welcomed the change, but said it would \"remain vigilant to ensure that new proposals are not just as bad, or worse\".\n\n\"Age verification for porn as currently legislated would cause huge privacy problems if it went ahead,\" executive director of Open Rights Group Jim Killock said.\n\n\"We are glad the government has stepped back from creating a privacy disaster, that would lead to blackmail scams and individuals being outed for the sexual preferences.\"\n\nIn June, the laws were delayed and set to be shelved, after a failure to comply with EU standards -- an ironic outcome given the country has torn itself apart over how to leave Europe.\n\nLast month, Australia decided it would, not for the first time, follow in the steps of the UK, and look into its own age verification regime for porn and gambling.\n\nAustralia's House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs is looking into \"the potential benefits of further online age verification requirements, including to protect children from potential harm, and business and non-government organisations from reputation, operational and legal risks\", according to the committee's terms of reference.\n\nAustralia's contentious encryption laws were based on the UK's snoopers' charter.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nAustralian House Committee to look into age verification for porn\n\nNew inquiry becomes latest front in the culture war from the Australian government.\n\nUK to withdraw from online porn block, censorship crusade\n\nOpinion: The irony is strong in enforcing ID verification laws when the government fails to implement its own legal checks.\n\nWhy the UK's porn block will backfire spectacularly\n\nOpinion: Censorship won't stop teens from bypassing age checks and will only show up the lawmakers behind the changes.\n\nUK to introduce porn age-checks on July 15\n\nAdult websites will have to implement age-checks for UK visitors by July 15 or risk getting banned by UK ISPs.\n\nUK hacking powers can be challenged in court, judge rules\n\nUK spies are no longer allowed to skip court if their choices are considered unlawful.", "description": "While ending its plans for overt age verification, the UK government said it remains committed to \"protecting children online\".", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/05/7a6d518e-4cca-11e4-b6a0-d4ae52e95e57/thumbnail/770x578/8305fd1f8b4330a074ae355f4f3f6636/houses-of-parliament-westminster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
