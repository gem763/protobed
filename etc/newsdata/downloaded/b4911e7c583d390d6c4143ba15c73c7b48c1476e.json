I\u2019m going to f*****g rape you.\u2019\n\nJoshua Reilly leaves Hull Crown Court after he admitted harassing women with vile rape threats (Picture: MEN Media)\n\nHe made a further 33 calls to the woman over the following week.\n\nIn a victim statement, she said: \u2018I\u2019m scared to go out of the house and don\u2019t like being alone.\u2019\n\nShe worried that he would come to her home and says she couldn\u2019t sleep at night.\n\nThe victim added: \u2018I don\u2019t know if he knows where I live. I can\u2019t live a normal life.\n\nHer partner thought she was seeing someone else and did not believe the messages were from a stranger.\n\nShe added: \u2018It put a huge strain on my relationship leading to my marriage breaking down.\n\nJoshua Reilly made sexual threats to the woman after spotting them on Gumtree or Facebook (Picture: MEN Media)\n\n\u2018I feel I\u2019m being watched all the time, and not knowing who this person was made me nervous in every part of my life.\u2019\n\nThe other three victims were targeted after placing items for sale online through Gumtree or Facebook.\n\nIn each case, Reilly, from Hull, contacted them to ask if the items were still for sale before making sexual threats.\n\nWhen one victim declined to sell Reilly some headphones at the price he wanted, he told her: \u2018No, you will sell it to me for \u00a320 or I\u2019ll rape you.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReilly also bombarded that victim with calls and said in one: \u2018Let\u2019s see if your daughter cries while I rape you.\u2019\n\nHe admitted three counts of putting a person in fear of violence by harassment, and an offence under the Malicious Communications Act at Hull Crown Court in April.\n\nHe had two previous convictions for sexual assault against a girl under 13 when he was a juvenile.\n\nClaire Holmes, defending, said he now had some insight into his offending and was genuinely remorseful.\n\nSentencing Reilly, Judge David Tremberg told him: \u2018You undertook a gratuitous campaign of vile harassment and intimidation, targeting four entirely blameless female victims who had the most minor connection with you.\n\n\u2018You operate well below the average range of abilities in most, if not all, respects.\n\n\u2018You are isolated, lacking the support most people take for granted. You would be a very vulnerable prisoner.\u2019\n\nThe judge said giving Reilly a suspended sentence to build on \u2018improvements and diminish the risk\u2019 in future would be better than a spell in prison.\n\nHe received a ten months, suspended for two years, and was ordered to undertake up to 30 days rehabilitation.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
