The pace was in the middle of the central government\u2019s full-year target for gross domestic product, as business investment continued to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cThough analysts had expected to see Chinese GDP growth to be weaker than in the previous quarters the overall expectation was of an increase of 6.1% with a decline to below 6% at some point next year,\u201d said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, in a note. \u201cHowever, Friday\u2019s data shows that the decline is accelerating and that trade-war frictions are taking their toll faster than expected.\u201d\n\nWhile the weaker growth might stir expectations Beijing will be more amenable to completing a trade deal with the U.S., it\u2019s also likely to reinforce concerns about a slowing global economy.\n\nStocks were buoyed Thursday after U.K. and European Union leaders announced a tentative agreement on Brexit, but the deal faces a significant hurdle in the U.K. Parliament with a debate and vote set for Saturday.\n\nRead: What a Brexit deal would mean for U.S. stocks and global investors\n\nA busy week for earnings comes to a close Friday.
