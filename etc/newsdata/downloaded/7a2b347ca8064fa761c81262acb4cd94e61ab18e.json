With six minutes to go a 14-man France were threatening to wreck Warren Gatland\u2019s final tournament as Wales head coach, only for a scrambled close-range try from replacement Ross Moriarty to propel his team into the last four.\n\nWales 20-19 France: Rugby World Cup 2019, quarter-final \u2013 live reaction! Read more\n\nUltimately this was a breathless tale of beauty and the beast. At times France played some of the most beguiling rugby of the tournament only for their second-row forward S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina to ruin everything. Nine points ahead with an attacking scrum within range of the Wales line, the 27-year-old Clermont lock caught Aaron Wainwright with a deliberate and blatant elbow, leaving the referee Jaco Peyper no option but to show him a red card.\n\nThe last time Wales played France in a World Cup knock out fixture, a red card for Sam Warburton proved to be the game\u2019s decisive moment. This was only the third sending-off in the latter stages of the tournament and again it turned the match, this time allowing Wales to fight another day.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sebastien Vahaamahina was sent off for a stray elbow on Wales\u2019 Aaron Wainwright.

Ultimately it was to be in a losing cause but one glance at Guilhem Guirado during the anthems was enough to realise Wales could expect a proper contest. As the French captain gripped the team mascot\u2019s shirt tightly enough to test the durability of the material, it was obvious Les Bleus were up for the challenge and inside the first eight minutes they had two tries on the board.\n\nJapan v South Africa: Rugby World Cup 2019, quarter-final \u2013 live! Read more\n\nWith Wales still adjusting to the occasion, the giant Vahaamahina rumbled over from close range and a sharp break from Vakatawa was then the catalyst for a second glorious score, the supporting Dupont putting the flanker Charles Ollivon away to score. Ntamack\u2019s first conversion attempt had bounced off a post but he made no mistake with his second to put his side 12-0 in front.\n\nWales needed to wake up fast and enjoyed a much-needed boost when Guirado lost possession in contact and Wainwright swooped on the loose ball to race over from fully 40 metres. It was to prove only a temporary reprieve, with France suddenly starting to play like the Barbarians on acid.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aaron Wainwright (centre) breaks away to score a first-half try for Wales.

Vakatawa, following more neat passing from Ntamack and Penaud, surged over to score France\u2019s third try and further points could easily have materialised shortly afterwards. A lovely arching outside break by Ntamack looked odds-on to conjure another try but the scrambling Welsh defence somehow survived.\n\nThere was to be another let-off when Ntamack hit the post again with a penalty attempt and, just before the interval, Welsh fans in the stadium were extremely glad advantage was being played when a long looping pass from Ken Owens was intercepted and Guirado momentarily thought he had scored his side\u2019s fourth try.\n\nThe withdrawal of Ntamack at half-time along with Vahaamahina\u2019s premature exit, however, gave Wales a lifeline. They should have scored when George North, with two unmarked men outside him, had a pass intercepted by Yoann Huget but, with the clock counting down, up popped Moriarty to save Wales\u2019s bacon.", "description": "Wales beat France 20-19 to book a place in the last four of the Rugby World Cup after Sebastien Vahaamahina saw red for a vicious elbow on Aaron Wainwright", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ce0208304c5d576b4b2f1f25b9933a3fe019cdb/75_291_4688_2813/master/4688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f2da942ad86b28849a0da3865cf54db", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
