It started in 2012 after the shooting at Sandy Hook\u2014and it\u2019s continued since. First, Dick's banned sales of AR-15s, then kowtowed to the anti-gun crowd by straight-up destroying millions of dollars worth of rifles. The sporting goods giants\u2019 political activity has cost them some $250 million in potential business, but it might be all worth it if its CEO wins the presidency. Yeah, maybe all of these moves could be a way for Ed Stack to test the 2020 waters (via Politico):\n\nEd Stack, the CEO of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is testing the waters for a possible third-party presidential bid that could scramble the dynamics of the 2020 general election.\n\nVarious messages were presented to a focus group in southern Wisconsin this week centering on the billionaire businessman, along with possible three-way match-ups against Donald Trump and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe focus group, according to a source who took part in the testing, ran through varying themes involving Stack and heavily focused on his example of \u201cshowing leadership\u201d by halting the sale of assault-style rifles at all of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods stores in the wake of the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe message testing told a different story. Those in the group were shown several short videos of other candidates including Biden, Warren and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz \u2014 a fellow billionaire who explored a presidential bid as an independent before announcing in September that he would not run \u2014 but viewed eight or nine videos that included Stack messaging, according to a focus group participant.\n\nThe focus group member, who presented paperwork to verify participation, declined to be named.\n\nAmong the questions posed to the roughly two dozen participants: \u201cWould you be open to voting for a third party candidate?\u201d\n\nNot all the feedback was positive for Stack, who is 64.\n\n\u201c[Focus group members] mentioned that if Biden\u2019s getting the criticism that he looked old, Ed Stack didn\u2019t look young either,\u201d the participant said, adding that some felt Stack \u201cdidn\u2019t have the charisma it would take to attract a coalition that you\u2019d need to have a chance as a third-party candidate.\u201d\n\n[\u2026]\n\nJoe Hunter, an adviser to Gary Johnson\u2019s Libertarian Party presidential bids in 2012 and 2016 said he has heard Stack\u2019s \u201cname come up\u201d in discussions about a possible run for president.\n\nBut he cautioned about the uphill battle of landing on state ballots for any third party candidate.", "description": ".10/24/2019 0:50:04AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/59/cf1cbbd2-3018-4d8a-aa83-abc9e0481298.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
