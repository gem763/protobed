The US and the European Union are investigating.\n\nHealth authorities say there is no immediate risk, but patients have been advised to consult a doctor who can prescribe alternatives to ranitidine.\n\nWhat is the fear about?\n\nOn 13 September, both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published their decisions to review the presence of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in medicines containing the drug ranitidine.\n\nNDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) on the basis of animal studies.\n\nNDMA is found in water and foods, including meats, dairy products, and vegetables, but is not expected to cause harm when ingested in very low levels, EMA says.\n\nRanitidine products are used to reduce the production of stomach acid in patients with conditions such as heartburn and stomach ulcers.\n\nThey are available over-the-counter and on prescription.\n\nWho has recalled the products so far?\n\nCVS's announcement on Saturday said it was suspending the sale of Zantac and CVS Health brand ranitidine products \"out of an abundance of caution\".\n\n\"Zantac brand products and CVS brand ranitidine products have not been recalled, and the FDA is not recommending that patients stop taking ranitidine at this time,\" the company said.\n\nWalgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid in the US had earlier taken a similar decision.\n\nCanada and France have removed the drugs from pharmacy shelves. A number of other countries have followed suit.\n\nBangladesh on Sunday issued a temporary ban on the import, production and sale of ranitidine while it investigates the links to cancer.\n\nDrug makers are also recalling products containing NDMA.\n\nSandoz, owned by Novartis, told the BBC it was recalling \"several batches of its ranitidine-containing medicines\". The recalls were \"under way or pending\" in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the US.\n\nApotex also said it was recalling ranitidine tablets in the US.\n\nThe BBC has approached GlaxoSmithKline - original makers of Zantac. The company is reported to have stopped distributing its generic version of the drug and recalled its products from India and Hong Kong.\n\nWhat should patients do?\n\nHealth regulators are urging people taking ranitidine not do discontinue it immediately.\n\nThe FDA said, however, that those taking it by prescription should contact health professionals about alternatives. And those buying it over the counter could consider other options.\n\nFrench authorities also emphasised there was no \"acute risk\" and patients should not stop the medication or return it to pharmacies.", "description": "CVS pharmacies become the latest to withdraw Zantac, a drug being investigated for cancer links.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15C35/production/_109014198_mediaitem109014195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
