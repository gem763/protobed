We are in contact with the customer to resolve the matter and have offered to reduce the charges by 50 per cent as a gesture of goodwill.'\n\nDespite the goodwill offer, Didier is concerned about how a call without his permission could have allegedly taken place.\n\nHe is not the first to be stung by a supposed scam like this as the Daily Mail has previously reported on a similar scam \u2013 many victims of which were also Vodafone customers.\n\nAnother similar scam that has affected a number of people is the Wangiri scam, where victims call fraudsters back after receiving an unknown call, usually from an international number.\n\nThe victim then ends up spending a fortune for every minute they are spent on the line after they are unwittingly directed to a premium rate overseas number.\n\nSome mobile phone users have reported being charged after calling back an unknown number\n\nWhat you can do to protect yourself from phone scams\n\nWith a growing number of fraudulent calls being reported, there are steps you can take to protect yourself from phone scams and unwanted callers.\n\nFirstly, talk to your phone provider to see what call blocking services they offer. It may be worth shopping around as different providers have different charges.\n\nAlso, sign up to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) which allows consumers to opt out of receiving any unsolicited telesales calls.\n\nYou can register your phone number \u2013 either landline or mobile \u2013 on the TPS website or by phoning 0345 070 0707. It's free to register and takes up to 28 days to come into effect.\n\nAnother way to protect yourself is by being wary of who you give your contact details to and what you are agreeing to when responding to marketing texts.\n\nThis is also the case for any emails received - make sure to look at the opt in and opt out boxes at the bottom to see what you are actually agreeing to.\n\nWhat to do if you've received an unwanted call\n\nOfcom have recommended a number of things you can do if you have received a dodgy call ,or are suspicious of a missed call.\n\nFirstly, if you do notice a call from an overseas number, don't answer or return it unless you know where it is coming from.\n\nYou should also block any unfamiliar overseas and premium-rate numbers and share them with your phone company, so they can investigate.\n\nIt is then worth contacting the Phone-paid Services Authority (PSA) with any suspicious activity, as it is the regulatory body for all premium rate phone-paid services in the United Kingdom. It can therefore look into any complaints and identify issues in the phone-paid services market.\n\nAlso, make sure to check your phone bills regularly to see if any money has come out that shouldn't.\n\nOfcom also suggest reporting the incident to Action Fraud.", "description": "A Vodafone customer was shocked to find he had been charged \u00a360  after missing a mystery call from a Taiwanese number, but the mobile phone giant refused to refund him.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
