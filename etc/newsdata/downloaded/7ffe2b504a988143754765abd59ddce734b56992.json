He turned 95 last Tuesday, becoming the first U.S. president to reach that milestone.\n\nBefore construction began, Carter led a morning devotion for a group of several hundred volunteers.\n\nHe walked slowly across the uneven, muddy ground to the stage helped by a cane and several people who were nearby to steady him. Once seated, Carter, who still teaches Sunday school twice a month at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, spoke in a clear voice, peppering his inspirational message with jokes.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Bill Lee and First Lady Maria Lee.\n\nThe Carters worked on building corbels, a type of support bracket, for one of 21 homes that will be constructed in Nashville this week during the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project. According to Habitat for Humanity an additional 12 new single-family homes and 26 new townhomes will be constructed by 2021 with funds raised through the 2019 Carter Work Project.\n\nHabitat homeowners help build their own homes alongside volunteers and pay an affordable mortgage.\n\nEarlier in the day, just before the devotion, musician Eric Paslay played a song and joked about Carter\u2019s injury as he introduced him.\n\n\u201cAfter that bar fight, you coming out, building houses \u2026 I love you to death,\u201d Paslay said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Despite a bandage above his left eye and a red welt below it, former President Jimmy Carter helped build a home with Habitat for Humanity", "authors": ["Travis Loller"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jimmy_carter_habitat.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C337px%2C4667px%2C2443px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
