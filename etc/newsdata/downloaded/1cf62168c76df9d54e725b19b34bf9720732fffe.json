Biden has denied those allegations.\n\n\u201cNot one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertions,\u201d Biden told reporters after a campaign event Friday. \u201cSo, I have no comment except that the president should start to be president.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday on Trump's actions during the phone call.\n\nIn his Friday statement, Biden said Trump\u2019s \u201cbehavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation\u2014a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia\u2014pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAt minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress.\"\n\nTrump dismissed the reports as a \u201cridiculous story\u201d and the whistleblower as a \u201cpartisan person,\u201d but added \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed\u201d during the call. \u201cSomeone ought to look into Biden,\u201d the president continued.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers called foul last week after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire refused to disclose the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff threatened Thursday to force the Trump administration to disclose the complaint, with actions ranging from suing the administration to pulling funding for Office of the Director of National Intelligence.", "description": "Biden's comments come after a report that Trump pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate a potential political opponent.", "authors": ["Matthew Choi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ff/6d/8db4ba144853ba85ae031662761f/190920-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
