A black AK-47 was found in a bedroom near Owens' body, police said at the time.\n\nAdams was rushed to the Grady Memorial Hospital to undergo multiple surgeries before he was booked into jail, where he would remain for another 1,181 days.\n\nAfter an initial investigation, police accused Adams and Owen \u2013 who both lived at the complex \u2013 of shooting each other, while Humphrey and White were believed to have shot Chevis.\n\nMeanwhile Meyes was accused of waiting in a vehicle after the shooting.\n\nAuthorities also recovered a .38 caliber round, two 9mm pistols and a 7.62 assault rifle at the scene.\n\nAdams was accused of possessing one of the pistols, but Sheppard argued his client had nothing to do with the shoot-out, citing ballistic evidence that proved Adams couldn\u2019t have pulled the trigger.\n\n\u2018He went there to buy marijuana, and then another person in the room, who is now deceased, and the drug dealer, who is now deceased, got into a gun battle,\u2019 Sheppard told AJC.\n\n\u2018A security guy at the door also got into it ... it was just a horrible thing that we lose young people to this type of violence.\u2019\n\nThe shooting at the Embarcadero Club Apartments (right) in the 2200 block of Sullivan Road killed Dtris Owens, Brandon Chevis and Bobby Humphrey, while Adams was shot but survived\n\nResponding officers found Brandon Chevis (above) dead in the living room, while Humphrey was found dead in the kitchen and Owens was found dead inside a bedroom.

They each face the same 22 felony charges, including three counts of murder, three counts of aggravated assault and one count of armed robbery.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when either of the men will go to trial. They have both been behind bars 1,211 days without bond.", "description": "Demarrius Adams, 21, had been looking to buy $10 worth of marijuana in 2016 when he was caught in a deadly crossfire at the Embarcadero Club Apartments on Sullivan Road, Atlanta.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19545162-0-image-a-71_1570720183189.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
