Most notable was a guided missile fired by Julian Castro, the U.S. housing secretary under Obama, who worked hard to portray Biden as past his prime.\n\nCastro, 44, alleged Biden was \"forgetting\u201d something he had said a few minutes earlier and then followed it up by charging that he, not Biden, was the better steward of Obama\u2019s legacy, resulting in audible gasps from the large crowd in attendance.\n\nAs it turned out, Castro was incorrect about what Biden had said earlier.\n\nBiden's advisers criticized Castro for what they called a \"cheap shot\" and argued that Castro had not learned the lesson of the first two debates - attacking Biden does not pay off.\n\n\u201cCastro went too far, tone-wise,\u201d said Delacey Skinner, a Democratic strategist in Washington who is unaffiliated with a campaign. \u201cThe jab at Biden's age was cringeworthy.\u201d\n\nEven U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a candidate on stage with Biden, told ABC News afterward that Castro\u2019s attack was \u201cso personal and so unnecessary.\"\n\nAsked afterward about the charge he had taken a cheap shot, Castro told MSNBC: \"I completely disagree,\" and said he was not suggesting Biden was too old but seeking to highlight their policy differences on healthcare.\n\nBiden was helped as well by several candidates paying homage to Obama\u2019s record, which reinforced Biden\u2019s long-standing argument that he is best positioned to build on the former president\u2019s achievements and reverse Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nBiden himself seized on Obama\u2019s popularity with Democrats early on, by suggesting that Warren lined up with Sanders, a self-described socialist, on policy issues, while he mirrored Obama.\n\nIn doing so, Biden drew a sharp distinction between himself and his two closest challengers. \u201cThe senator says she's for Bernie,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, I'm for Barack.\u201d\n\nSkinner said another candidate who probably helped himself the most on Thursday was Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman who has refashioned his campaign persona in the aftermath of last month\u2019s shootings in his hometown of El Paso that killed 22.", "description": "Those expecting Joe Biden's presidential candidacy to flame out any day now will have to keep waiting.
