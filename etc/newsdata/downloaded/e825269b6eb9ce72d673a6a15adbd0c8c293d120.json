In the early 1990s, pastoralist Jack Morrow left $10 million to his old school, Melbourne Grammar. In 2013 Snow made his first gift to Canberra Grammar of $8 million for an Asian New Century centre, and in 2015 businessman Simon Fenwick gave $1.34 million to Brisbane Grammar, his old school.\n\nCompare that with the University of Sydney, which boasted earlier this year that it had raised $1 billion from wealthy patrons in less than 10 years.\n\nJBWerePhilanthropic Services research shows individual donors' gifts to universities are considerably larger than gifts to schools. In 2017, donations received by the top five universities totalled $326 million whereas the top five school groups received $55 million across multiple campuses.\n\nCo-founder John McLeod says universities are the clear choice for benefactors.\n\nIn a ranking of donors' preferences, arts and culture organisations take second place to universities, followed by health and medical research, and there is a growing interest in environmental donations. Schools do not even rank in the top five for philanthropists.\n\n\"People want to be involved in research, innovation, scholarships and change. It's not about the university, it's about what the university is doing,\" McLeod says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Schools are different. Donors to primary and secondary education generally have an allegiance to a particular school. They may have a family history there and they usually see a specific need, perhaps related to science, arts or sport.\"\n\nTerry Snow fits the model. He's a Canberra Grammar old boy, was \"not overly academic\" but developed an affinity for the school because of what he learned, which was not always in the classroom.\n\n\"I was a marathon runner at school,\" he says.\n\n\"It's true there is no pain without gain. Sometimes you have to hurt more than the other bloke. It was because of hard work, dedication and enthusiasm that I managed to have the modicum of success I have today\".\n\nThat's an understatement. He's ranked 43rd on The Australian Financial Review Rich List with a net worth of $1.86 billion in 2019.\n\n\"Universities pull in so much money,\" says Snow. \"If you put money into medical research you hope your contribution will go to some big solution. It's not like that with schools. Universities and think tanks all get the money.\"\n\nBut there is another reason why universities do well from donors and schools do not. Universities automatically qualify for deductible gift recipient status under federal tax law. Schools don't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is possible for a school to receive specific donations for scholarships, building funds or a library, but they have to set up separate financial entities to manage the gift.\n\nThe chief executive of Philanthropy Australia, Sarah Davies, says the complications of separate entities with their accountants, lawyers and auditors rule out almost all public schools and even some private ones from attracting donations.\n\n\"Universities have huge alumni and development teams. Private schools have development teams but not on the scale of universities. Public schools would have a tough case to make to appoint a development team.\n\n\"In the US, alumni giving to schools is far greater. The emotional connection is developed from day one. The expectation that you will give back to your school is instilled in students from day one.\n\nIn the US alumni giving to schools is far greater. The emotional connection is developed from day one. \u2014 Sarah Davies, CEO, Philanthropy Australia\n\n\"Universities have started doing it, but I don't think schools do,\" she adds. \"There is a cultural factor at work: people think the state will provide school education. Schools have not been able to break that link.\"\n\nDavies says very poor state schools can receive private donors' money thanks to an innovation by businessman David Gonski. He persuaded the federal government to allow charitable trusts to channel funds to low socioeconomic status schools.\n\nThe result was Schools Plus which aggregates tax deductible donations and allocates them according to need. Since it was set up, 800 schools have applied for funds to provide specialised teachers, relief teachers and technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchools Plus says 4600 primary or secondary schools qualify for low socioeconomic status and in the past four years it has distributed $14 million in charitable donations.\n\nDoes Snow have any misgivings about donating to a private school when there are so many public schools in need of teachers and tech equipment?\n\n\"I'm in a position I can do this, and it's a good thing I can,\" he says.\n\n\"Some people might say it's elitist. But so is Oxford, Cambridge or the Sorbonne. Are we suggesting we should break them up and split them into lots of small universities?\n\n\"You do need a beacon, a light house. This shows the way to other private schools.\n\n\"How do you promote growth in private schools? Fees can't go up much higher and government contributions are not going to go up. So we make a small contribution and we create scholarships for those who can't afford it.\"", "description": "Terry Snow's $20 million donation to Canberra Grammar stands out because philanthropists are more likely to give money to universities and think tanks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1794%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_211%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b78b44b6ea86e984f4d83eb87e7e53aeb94ebbfb", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
