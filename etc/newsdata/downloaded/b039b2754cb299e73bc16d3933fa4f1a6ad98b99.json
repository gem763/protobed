While the Nets and Lakers are still scheduled to play each other in Shenzen again on Saturday, the league has decided to self-enforce the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s policy and continue the silence.\n\n\u201cWe have decided not to hold media availability for our teams for the remainder of our trip in China,\u201d the NBA announced in a statement Friday. \u201cThey have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe league is making this decision independent of Chinese authorities, sources told ESPN.\u201d\n\nAccording to ESPN:\n\nNets and Lakers players are free to comment on the circumstances without NBA retribution, according to a league spokesman. However, this media policy was already discussed with players and representatives from the players\u2019 association, according to a league source, so the motivation to operate outside of the league\u2019s guidelines is negligible.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s forced silence should not come as a surprise. Saturday\u2019s game between the Nets and Lakers will take place only 20 miles from Hong Kong. The close proximity, would likely have lead to an increase in media questions relating to the political situation between Hong Kong and China.\n\nOn Thursday, the NBA landed in hot water after a Rockets media relations representative shut down a CNN reporter\u2019s question to a pair of Rockets players about the political situation in China. That episode, in addition to their strong desire to avoid further angering their communist hosts, likely factored into the league\u2019s decision.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "The National Basketball Association has canceled all press conferences and media availability for the duration of their China trip, to avoid", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/gty-andy-lyons-640x480-640x480-R-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
