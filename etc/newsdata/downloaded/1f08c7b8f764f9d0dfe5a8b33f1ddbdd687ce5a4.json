His front-runner status has eroded as Senator Elizabeth Warren has moved into a statistical tie with him or taken a slight lead in key state and national polls.\n\nMr Trump and his GOP allies have unleashed unfounded corruption allegations about his son Hunter's business dealings, and Mr Biden finished the third quarter of fundraising behind Ms Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.\n\n'Unprecedented' attacks\n\nMr Harpootlian said the donors expressed their concerns about the strength of Ms Warren's candidacy and Mr Trump's increasingly aggressive attacks on Mr Biden and his family. He said Mr Biden, 76, acknowledged the he was slow to counter Mr Trump's attacks.\n\n\"He voiced a concession that this is unprecedented, and it took him a beat or two longer than perhaps it should have to respond in a very aggressive way,\" Mr Harpootlian said of Mr Biden.\n\n\"That speaks to a positive aspect of Joe Biden's character. You want someone to be deliberate, not shooting from the hip. Now that he's engaged in this, he says he is going to beat him like a drum.\"\n\nMr Harpootlian said the campaign was armed with a clear strategy for moving forward and many donors left feeling energised to raise more money for Mr Biden.\n\n\"In 20/20 hindsight, he should have come out swinging, two nanoseconds\" after the first Trump accusation, Mr Harpootlian said.\n\n\"I think it's an affirmation of what a deliberate and decent guy Joe Biden is. Before he throws the first punch he wants to make sure that's the right thing to do. Again, this is such an unprecedented act.\"\n\nBlistering speech\n\nMr Biden has begun to take a much more aggressive posture towards Mr Trump. He gave a blistering speech last week in Reno, Nevada, assailing the President for abusing his power and smearing Mr Biden's family. He penned a Washington Post opinion piece on Saturday assailing \"conspiracy theories and smears\".\n\nMr Biden's campaign is spending US$6 million on broadcast and digital ads in the four early primary states characterisng the President as \"unhinged\", and the campaign has been aggressive in rebutting Mr Trump and his allies' attacks.\n\nNevertheless, the Trump campaign is also running millions of dollars on advertising that tries to link the former vice-president to Mr Hunter Biden's work as a director for Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nBut Mr Biden's campaign has begun a rapid response arm to the fight, making it a constant back-and-forth between the two men on Twitter and elsewhere.\n\nMr Biden has said that Mr Trump is attacking him because he's afraid of running against him. Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday that he would \"LOVE\" to run against Mr Biden, and the Biden campaign put out a statement pointing to numerous polls showing Mr Biden would beat Mr Trump in a general election.\n\nBig-dollar fundraising\n\nAccording to a schedule of the donor event obtained by Bloomberg News, guests gathered at campaign headquarters on Friday afternoon for a tour and then continued to a cocktail reception at the Continental Mid-Town hotel.\n\nOn Saturday, donors spent the day at the 201 Hotel for briefings and meetings. The campaign didn't comment on the meetings.\n\nMr Harpootlian said the weekend's programme was run by Mr Steve Ricchetti, who served as Mr Biden's chief of staff in the White House, and included briefings from Greg Schultz, the campaign manager, Pete Kavanaugh, the deputy campaign manager, and Kate Bedingfield, the communications director.\n\nThe donor summit reflected Mr Biden's traditional fundraising approach, which relies heavily on big-dollar, in-person fundraising events. In the last week of the quarter alone, Mr Biden held 10 private fundraising events across the country with only two campaign events. By contrast, Ms Warren and Mr Sanders have sworn off traditional fundraisers and have found much success in a small-dollar, online approach.\n\nIn the third quarter, Mr Biden raised US$15.2 million, which put him behind Mr Sanders and Ms Warren, both of whom raised more than US$24 million. Mr Buttigieg, the openly-gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, also outraised Mr Biden, bringing in US$19.1 million. The lacklustre haul ignited new concerns about Mr Biden's durability in the tight primary with a historically large field.\n\nBut, Mr Harpootlian pushed back against fundraising concerns and said the weekend injected new excitement into Mr Biden's top donors.\n\n\"I heard an excitement and enthusiasm from Biden that I haven't heard before,\" he said. \"He's much more upbeat than I've seen.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] Under attack from Donald Trump and following a lacklustre fundraising quarter, Joe Biden attempted this weekend to reassure his top donors, while acknowledging he was slow to respond forcefully to the US President's accusations of corruption. .
