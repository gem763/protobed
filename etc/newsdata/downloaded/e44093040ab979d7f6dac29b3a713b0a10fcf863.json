She was joined by another member of the so-called \u201cSquad,\u201d Rep. Ilhan Omar, who also informed Sanders of her endorsement on a phone call after his heart attack, according to a source familiar with her decision. A third Squad member, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, is expected to announce soon she is backing Sanders as well, though she said Wednesday she hasn't made an endorsement yet.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s support is a coup for the Vermont senator and a setback for his liberal rival, Elizabeth Warren. It came at an opportune time for Sanders, whose campaign was thrown into uncertainty after he was hospitalized for a heart attack early this month. Even before that, Sanders had been overtaken by Warren in early-state and national polls.\n\nSanders' aides and allies did not hide their excitement: Some of them burst into tears and embraced one another after news of the endorsements broke in a Washington Post report.\n\n\u201cThe man who\u2019s really been building the movement for a long time is hospitalized with a heart attack. At his age, no one thinks that\u2019s a good thing for the campaign,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, the communications director for the progressive group Justice Democrats, which formed out of Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign and recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run for Congress. \u201cTo have an endorsement right now is to continue to say this is a campaign that\u2019s important to progressives and the Democratic base.\u201d\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez will make their debut together on the campaign trail Saturday in New York City. Their rally is certain to draw comparisons to the large crowd that greeted Warren in the city\u2019s Washington Square Park last month. It probably won\u2019t be their last event: The teams are discussing more rallies across the primary states.\n\n\u201cWe certainly hope that she will be campaigning throughout the fall with the senator,\u201d said Sanders senior adviser Jeff Weaver.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez offered her endorsement to Sen. Bernie Sanders while he was hospitalized. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n\nOcasio-Cortez was an organizer on Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign and several of her aides have come from his team. But she had been complimentary of Warren and had held off on endorsing.\n\nPerhaps sensing an opportunity, Warren had been aggressively cultivating a relationship with Ocasio-Cortez, penning an effusive piece about her for the TIME 100 and partnering with the freshman\u2019s office on several congressional efforts.\n\nAsked about the endorsements on CNN following Tuesday night\u2019s debate, Warren said \u201c[L]ook, I have great respect for all three of those women. I think they are terrific. And here\u2019s what I know for sure, when this primary is over, we are all going to be on the same side.\u201d Her campaign declined to comment further.\n\nSanders\u2019 aides sensed that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement was within reach after she traveled to Burlington in late September to talk with Sanders and his team about her priorities, especially the Green New Deal. It\u2019s not clear who proposed the meetup in Vermont, but Shakir scheduled an hour-plus brunch between Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders. Shakir joined them, as did Jane Sanders and an aide to the congresswoman.\n\n\u201cI remember when they sat and talked to each other, it just felt like people who just know each other and understand each other,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cThey have been to some degree within their own caucuses \u2014 whether it's the House caucus or the Senate caucus \u2014 made to feel that they're outsiders looking in. And I think they find [a] common bond in that: That we are in a struggle where even the establishment of the Democratic Party doesn't always appreciate how we're approaching these issues.\u201d\n\nOmar, meanwhile, told her fellow Squad members that she had decided to endorse Sanders shortly after laying out her criteria for a candidate at the \u201cPeople\u2019s Presidential Forum\u201d in Iowa last month, according to the source familiar with her decision. She had been thinking about joining Sanders for some time, the person said, and talked with her allies about the importance of not following the polls but instead endorsing a candidate based on the issues.\n\n\u201cThe hospitalization raised the stakes a lot, emotionally and politically,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats. \u201cThey are all movement people, they are all organizers at heart, and they were inspired by what he started in 2016,\u201d she said of the members of Congress who endorsed Sanders.\n\nWarren\u2019s foreign policy, which is seen by some progressives as more hawkish than Sanders\u2019, was a factor in Omar\u2019s decision to endorse him over the Massachusetts senator. In a video released Wednesday, Omar said Sanders is \u201cthe only candidate that wants to make sure that we end our endless wars.\u201d\n\nOmar is planning to hit the trail for Sanders, and the senator is looking to do a future rally with Tlaib, whose district is in Michigan. Sanders announced Wednesday that he is joining Tlaib for a tour of her district later this month. He pulled off an upset victory in that state in the 2016 primary in part because he won over huge swaths of Muslim voters. Tlaib and Omar are the first Muslim women elected to Congress..\n\nThe lawmakers and Sanders are also in talks about doing promotional videos for him. Their support could potentially help Sanders shore up his support among young people, who have long been a key part of his base but which he has been bleeding somewhat to Warren in some polls.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

He has proposed plans for a wealth tax, student loans cancellation, and climate change that are more far-reaching than hers. And in an interview last week, Sanders said Warren \u201chas said that she is a capitalist through her bones \u2014 I'm not.\u201d\n\nWeaver said the Squad members\u2019 endorsements of Sanders will \u201cfurther cement his leadership of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for progressives to come together,\u201d he said, \u201cand defeat the conservative wing of the party and win the nomination and defeat Trump.\u201d\n\nThe endorsements and a strong debate performance Tuesday night breathed new life into Sanders\u2019 campaign after weeks of internal anxiety. \u201cYou know, to quote one of my favorite rappers LL Cool J, \u2018Don\u2019t call it a comeback, I\u2019ve been here for years,\u2019\u201d said Nina Turner, a co-chair of the Sanders campaign.\n\nAn exuberant Weaver said to expect Sanders to work as hard as ever. \u201cImagine Bernie now,\u201d he quipped, \u201cwith 100 percent blood flow.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5d/8d/ce28edde4acc85ade9650d2b0b82/191016-bernie-sanders-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
