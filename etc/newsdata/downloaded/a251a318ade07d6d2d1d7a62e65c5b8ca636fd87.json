Capital Economics now expects underlying inflation to fall toward zero next year.\n\nThe nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.3% in September from a year earlier, matching a median market forecast and slowing from a 0.5% gain in August.\n\nIt marked the slowest consumer inflation since April 2017, when the index rose 0.3%, the data showed. Prices of some 297 items rose but 168 items fell, while 58 others were unchanged.\n\nUnderscoring fragile domestic demand, an index stripping away the effects of fresh food and energy costs, which is seen by the BOJ as a key indicator of inflation, was up 0.5% in the year to September, slowing from the previous month's 0.6% gain.", "description": "The data will be among indicators the Bank of Japan will scrutinize at its Oct. 30-31 meeting, when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and price forecasts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104327221-GettyImages-599806330.jpg?v=1532563896", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
