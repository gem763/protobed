After Hannity claimed it was really the Democrats who were involved in interfering in the 2016 election, Rivera chimed in to discuss the Justice Department\u2019s inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nSaying he hopes it\u2019s true that the \u201cstuff is going to hit the fan\u201d when U.S. Attorney John Durham is finished \u201cinvestigating the investigators,\u201d Rivera then wondered if Durham\u2019s report would only be covered by Fox News\u2014and specifically Hannity\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cBy the way, we are hardly a channel of agreement,\u201d Hannity shouted in response. \u201cWe have a few resistance people on the channel if we\u2019re gonna be honest, Geraldo!\u201d\n\n\u201cI grant that,\u201d Rivera laughed while other voices off-camera chuckled.\n\n\u201cI mean total resistance, not half-resistance,\u201d Hannity added.\n\nEarlier in the day, Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano posted an op-ed to Fox News\u2019 website in which he argued Trump had committed an \u201cimpeachable offense\u201d by pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and withholding military aid at the same time. This comes on the heels of other Fox News anchors pushing back on Trumpworld\u2019s Ukraine-Biden narrative.\n\nRivera, meanwhile, went on to praise Hannity and his nightly regulars\u2014including controversial columnist John Solomon, who now finds himself in the middle of the Ukraine mess that he apparently helped start.\n\n\u201cThere are two truths here,\u201d the former daytime talk show host declared. \u201cThere is what we are uncovering with your team, Gregg Jarrett and John Solomon and Dan Bongino and all the rest and it\u2019s what everybody else and every other channel is talking about.\u201d\n\nIt was recently revealed that Solomon, whose Trump-friendly reporting has enraged his colleagues, emailed a copy of one of his Ukraine stories\u2014before it was published\u2014to two pro-Trump lawyers digging up dirt on Biden and an ally of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.", "description": "The Fox News civil war appears to still be underway, as Hannity once again took a not-so-subtle shot at some of his Fox News colleagues.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570157811/hannity_82_ggxeka", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
