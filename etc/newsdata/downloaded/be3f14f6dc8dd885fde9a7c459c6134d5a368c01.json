The pocket quickly collapsed on him, however, and sent him scrambling to the outside. Unable to find a target, Wilson went to simply throw the ball away.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nMatthews \u2014 who was in pursuit \u2014 made very clean contact with Wilson immediately as he threw the ball away, sending the quarterback flying to the ground.\n\nDespite the clean shoulder-to-shoulder contact as Wilson was making his throw, however, Matthews was called for roughing-the-passer.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, hitting a quarterback in the head or neck or after he\u2019s thrown the ball warrants that type of penalty. Matthews, though, hit Wilson on time \u2014 making clean contact with him less than a second after the ball left his hand, if that. The six-time Pro Bowler really couldn\u2019t have played that any better.\n\nThe penalty moved the Seahawks up to the 25 yard line, and set up an eventual five-yard touchdown from Chris Carson to put them up 30-29.\n\nWhile the Rams had one final chance, a 44-yard field goal attempt from Greg Zuerlein just missed the uprights, giving the Seahawks the critical NFC West win.\n\nFans erupt on social media\n\nAlmost instantly, fans took to social media to complain about the call.\n\nApparently Clay Matthews is not allowed to burp within smelling distance of a QB. #Seahawks #Rams \u2014 Michael Grey (@TheMichaelGrey) October 4, 2019\n\nOfficial NFL rulebook on roughing the passer:\n\n\n\n\u201cIf Clay Matthews did it then it\u2019s a penalty.\u201d \u2014 Tyler Brooke (@TylerDBrooke) October 4, 2019\n\nOnly reason that flag came out is because his name is clay Matthews \u2014 Tony Jones (@Tjonesonthenba) October 4, 2019\n\nI, for one, am utterly shocked that Clay Matthews was called for a phantom roughing the passer. \u2014 Curt Hogg (@CyrtHogg) October 4, 2019\n\nClay Matthews is about to lose his shit man \u2014 Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) October 4, 2019\n\nClay Matthews: *exists*\n\n\n\nRef: Personal foul, Number 52 defense. \u2014 Faux John Madden (@FauxJohnMadden) October 4, 2019\n\nBS call.
