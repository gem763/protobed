This season, in some sense, was always going to be about what the Nationals did without Harper and what the Philadelphia Phillies did with him. That dance is over. The Nationals of Anthony Rendon and Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg and Trea Turner have at least a one-night date in the postseason, and maybe more. The Phillies of Bryce Harper do not.\n\n\u201cThey have a good team,\u201d Harper said after he took his seat in front of his locker, too late to hear the analysis about his departure.\n\nAdmit it, Nationals fans. There was a part of you \u2014 and for some, not a small part \u2014 who relished that the delirium at Nationals Park late Tuesday night came with Harper in the house, watching it closely. There were memes. There were tweets. And that\u2019s fine, because it\u2019s sports, and where would sports be without a little animosity among (former) friends? Never mind that Harper pinch-hit late in that game and sent a baseball from old nemesis Hunter Strickland to the moon.\n\nNats GM Mike Rizzo credits Dave Martinez, \u2018special group\u2019 for playoff berth\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Harper said after the game, \u201cthey\u2019re still doing what they\u2019re doing over there, and we\u2019re going to get on a bus to go home.\u201d\n\nWhat Tuesday provided was some finality on Harper\u2019s seven-year stint in Washington. Yeah, he has worn a Phillies uniform since March, when he signed that 13-year, $330 million deal to remain in the National League East and face his old team 19 times a year. But he spoke wistfully of Washington in spring training, like he was still trying to figure out what went wrong with his career path.\n\nNow?\n\n\u201cI love Philly,\u201d he said. \u201cI absolutely love it.\u201d\n\nHe is a Phillie, then, not just in uniform, but in heart. Wednesday night, with the Phillies eliminated and the Nationals trying to figure out how to navigate the territory between here and next week\u2019s wild-card game, he played in his 153rd game with his new team. He has 34 home runs. He drove in 109 runs, a career high. He entered the game needing one more walk to reach 100, five more runs scored to reach 100.\n\nThose are stats that would traditionally be seen as pillars of an exceptional season. Harper knows how all that will be viewed.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to look at the average,\u201d he said, \u201clike they always do.\u201d\n\nHis average entering the game was .258, pedestrian. But batting average is a hollow stat. More important, his on-base-plus-slugging percentage was .880 \u2014 not bad, but not Bryce at his best. It ranks 40th in baseball, far off his MVP year of 2015 (1.109) or even the injury-shortened 2017 (1.008).\n\nHis self-assessment: \u201cIt\u2019s been good. I\u2019ll take this year.\u201d\n\nThe Nats fans who booed him this week will take theirs, too. The stats MLB Network cited Wednesday can\u2019t be linked to Harper\u2019s departure. But they\u2019re also interesting. This year\u2019s Nationals have bettered last year\u2019s across the board: runs per game (5.3 to 4.8), on-base percentage (. 340 to .335), slugging percentage (. 452 to .419). You name it.\n\nWhat matters more to Harper \u2014 and, again, to the fans here who booed him \u2014 was the relative success of the teams in the standings. No team entered the season with more anticipation than the Phillies, and not only because they added Harper, but because they traded for catcher J.T. Realmuto and signed outfielder Andrew McCutchen and closer David Robertson, spending hundreds of millions of dollars of owner John Middleton\u2019s money.\n\nAnd by Wednesday, the Phillies were playing out the string, and the Nats were prepping for more. That seems stark. Harper said it rolls off him.\n\nState of the race: What the Nationals need to do to host the wild-card game\n\n\u201cI said that from the beginning: It takes time to build something great,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI\u2019ve put my faith in Mr. Middleton and [General Manager Matt] Klentak and what they think we\u2019re going to be as an organization. Some things went south this year. It happens. That\u2019s part of the game. Injuries, all that. But we\u2019re going to have a big offseason. I\u2019m excited to see what we can do as a team, as an organization.\u201d\n\nBut it had to \u2014 it just had to \u2014 be weird watching the Nationals assemble on the infield Tuesday night, waiting for the final out of the Chicago Cubs\u2019 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, waiting to celebrate their first postseason berth without Harper.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Harper said. \u201cThey should be where they are. They have three of the best pitchers in all of baseball. They have three No. 1s. They\u2019ve got one of the best lineups as well. I\u2019m happy for the guys over there.\u201d\n\nThroughout his final year in Washington, Harper was the most consistent and vocal voice backing Manager Davey Martinez. \u201cHappy for Davey,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd then, the interesting part.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for Rendon and what he\u2019s done this year,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI hope he has a huge postseason and gets what he deserves as a free agent \u2014 wherever that may be.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the Bryce with a little casual edge. Rendon has been the Nationals\u2019 best player, a legitimate MVP candidate. Thus far, the Nationals have been unable to re-sign him, and free agency is just a month away. Harper knows how badly he wanted to come back to Washington, and how he couldn\u2019t get it done. The Nationals have publicly said they want Rendon back and, privately, have pursued him. \u201cWherever that may be,\u201d that\u2019s Harper\u2019s way of saying, \u201cI know how this goes.\u201d\n\nSo the lines are now drawn. In spring training, it was all new. He didn\u2019t know where he would live. Now, he has a home in southern New Jersey. \u201cLove my neighborhood,\u201d he said. In Washington, he always seemed the teenager who came up, hair on fire. Now, he is, of all things, a dad; his wife Kayla gave birth to their son Krew last month. Part of this week was spent holding Krew in the bowels of Nationals Park, introducing him to current and former teammates.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a little champ, man,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop looking at him when I see him. I can\u2019t stop holding him. It\u2019s just a joy.\u201d\n\nWhen Harper came up in the first, Nationals Park mustered what it could for emotion \u2014 throaty and loud boos. Maybe next year, that\u2019ll end, too. The transition is over. Harper is a Phillie for life. His old team is in the playoffs, and his new one will go home. That mattered in 2019, the first year of the rest of his life. It\u2019ll matter less and less every season going forward.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nPredicting the Nationals\u2019 wild-card roster\n\nIn Nationals\u2019 clincher, Max Scherzer\u2019s uneven outing offers more questions than answers\n\nBoswell: The Nationals earned their spot in the postseason, but they still have unfinished business", "description": "Former Washington star makes no apologies for his exit and seems to have no animosity toward his old team.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/njzWnz25cGZ_CkgjC3nwPBlJUKU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KGQNBQG7BQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
