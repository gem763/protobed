But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends First American Financial (FAF) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this financial services company a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for First American Financial is 20.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 24.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 21.3%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for First American Financial is 43.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 12.7%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12.4% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 7.2%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for First American Financial. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.8% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFirst American Financial has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions First American Financial well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
