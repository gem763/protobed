His only hope of doing that is to pass the Brexit-implementing bill through Britain\u2019s fractious Parliament before then.\n\nJohnson\u2019s announcement piles pressure on lawmakers as they consider whether to approve the government\u2019s legislation, which would finally take Britain out of the EU \u2014 more than three years after voters opted to leave the bloc.\n\nThe bill faces two votes Tuesday, with lawmakers first being asked to approve it in principle, followed by a vote on the government\u2019s schedule for debate and possible amendments.\n\nJohnson said backing the bill would allow lawmakers to \u201cturn the page and allow this Parliament and this country to begin to heal and unite.\u201d\n\nWhile many analysts expect the bill to be approved, lawmakers may reject the three-day timetable because of concerns it doesn\u2019t provide enough time for scrutiny of the 115-page document, which sets out the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the 28-nation bloc.\n\nMajor bills usually take weeks or months to pass through Parliament, giving time for line-by-line scrutiny by lawmakers.\n\nGreen lawmaker Caroline Lucas tweeted that lawmakers \u201chad more time to debate the Wild Animals in Circuses Act (affecting 19 animals) than they will to decide the future of 65 million people. It\u2019s hard to think of anything which better illustrates this Govt\u2019s contempt for people, Parliament & democracy.\u201d\n\nOminously for the government, some lawmakers who support the Brexit deal said they would vote against the short timetable.\n\n\u201cUnless you are prepared to contemplate more expansive debate, there is not the slightest possibility of considering the deal that has been obtained within the time available,\u201d Ken Clarke, a senior lawmaker recently ousted from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party group in Parliament, told the Guardian newspaper.\n\nThe showdown comes just nine days before Britain\u2019s scheduled departure date. Johnson\u2019s government had sought a \u201cstraight up-and-down vote\u201d Monday on the agreement he struck last week with the 27 other EU nations laying out the terms of Britain\u2019s exit.\n\nBut the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, refused to allow it because lawmakers voted to delay approving the Brexit deal on Saturday, and parliamentary rules bar the same measure from being considered a second time during a session of Parliament unless something has changed.\n\nBercow\u2019s ruling plunged the tortuous Brexit process back into grimly familiar territory: acrimonious uncertainty.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservatives hold just 288 of the 650 House of Commons seats, so he will need support from opposition and independent lawmakers to pass the bill \u2014 if, that is, Parliament approves the timetable on Tuesday.\n\nThe bill turns the deal Johnson struck with the EU into law. It sets out the terms of Britain\u2019s departure, including measures to maintain an open border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. It also enshrines the right of U.K. and EU citizens living in the other\u2019s territory to continue with their lives, and sets out the multi-billion pound (dollar) payments Britain must make to meet its financial obligations to the EU.\n\nIt also confirms a transition period lasting until at least the end of 2020 \u2014 and possibly 2022 \u2014 in which relations will remain frozen as they are now while a permanent new relationship is worked out.\n\nOpposition lawmakers plan to seek amendments that could substantially alter the bill, for example by adding a requirement that the Brexit deal be put to voters in a new referendum, or by requiring the government to extend the transition period until a new trade deal with the EU has been agreed.\n\nThe government says such major amendments would wreck its legislation and it will withdraw the bill if the opposition plan succeeds.\n\nWith the Brexit deadline looming and British politicians still squabbling over the country\u2019s departure terms, Johnson has been forced to ask the EU for a three-month delay to Britain\u2019s departure date.\n\nHe did that, grudgingly, to comply with a law passed by Parliament ordering the government to postpone Brexit rather than risk the economic damage that could come from a no-deal exit.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said Tuesday that EU leaders \u201cwill decide in coming days\u201d whether to grant Britain another extension to the deadline for leaving the bloc, but said their decision depends on developments in London.\n\nTusk said Tuesday that the decision on prolonging Brexit for three months after Oct. 31. \u201cwill very much depend on what the British parliament decides or doesn\u2019t decide.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was headed for a showdown Tuesday with lawmakers who want to put the brakes on his drive to push his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/22/8b1958_britain-brexit-97555-flags-flutter-in-wind-houses-parliament-in-london-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
