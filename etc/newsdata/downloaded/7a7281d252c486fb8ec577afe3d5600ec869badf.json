It was gently ruched at the collar with a 1970s necktie detail, and was worn by a makeup-less model who resembled a divinity with myriad gold sequins around the eyes.\n\nFor spring, Piccioli took us to heaven.\n\n___\n\nCHIRAC MEMORIAL PROMPTS CREATIVE MEANS OF TRANSPORT\n\nThe house of Valentino, whose Sunday show was staged inside the grounds of Les Invalides, sent out a flurry of messages to guests alerting them to traffic concerns and to arrive extra-early.\n\nThe warnings were sent because Les Invalides was also the site of a public ceremony on Sunday afternoon in memoriam of former French President Jacques Chirac who recently died.\n\nThe thousands-strong lines of mourners, multiple police cordons and snaking traffic encouraged normally cab-hailing fashion insiders to resort to creative means of transport.\n\nOne bicycle-riding editor in an impractical, long layered designer dress wore eccentric ankle clips to stop her look catching in the chain.\n\nSome others simply walked kilometers from the previous show in the drizzle.\n\nBut the most popular option seemed to be one of the newest forms of transport taking Paris Fashion Week by storm: Rent-a-scooters. Companies such as Lime have capitalized on the mayhem and offered fashion week guests special offers for their services for the duration of the season.\n\n___\n\nFADED PAST MEETS DENIM AT GIVENCHY\n\nIn a more commercially minded collection than usual, British designer Clare Waight Keller\u2019s mission statement was to merge a \u201ctough urban energy\u201d with the \u201cpatina of time.\u201d\n\nFaded denim - of which the show invitation was fashioned - provided the urban edge in loose and frayed cropped pants or a funky boho skirt with inset fabric, while historic gowns in brightly colored 18th century prints referenced the styles of a bygone era.\n\nBut much of the diverse 63-piece collection didn\u2019t fit these themes. Instead, they channeled a wearable - and sometimes play-it-safe - \u201870s vibe that recalled Waight-Keller\u2019s days at the design helm of Chloe.\n\nThere were stylish moments: For example, the kick on heavy pleated floor-length silk skirts that sometimes peeked out - boho style - from beneath low hanging tops.\n\nBalloon sleeves and retro scarf necklines, meanwhile, added to this season\u2019s inescapable fixation with all things \u201870s.\n\nThe pieces de resistance came at the end as trapeze-silhouette gowns merged historic Persian-inspired prints with fashion-forward acid hues of electric green, cobalt and brilliant azure.\n\n___\n\nTHOM BROWNE\u2019S WINTER GARDEN\n\nA snow-covered garden, frozen white wilting roses and tiny white birds suspended in the air resembling snowflakes provided the backdrop as showman Thom Browne transported guests to an off-season winter wonderland to showcase his spring-summer collection.\n\nThough it was lost on guests if the imaginative presentation was a comment on climate change, the inventive styles made a statement of their own.\n\nBrowne injected his trademark contradictions onto his tight bread-and-butter suit styles.\n\nGiant bowling shoes redesigned as dolphins led on to truncated shells of crinolines.\n\nThese historic garments cut a surreal silhouette when placed below a striped skirt-suit with dolphin motifs, with the skirt was hoisted up to the bust.\n\nThe skeletal crinolines were then fleshed out as the show progressed with layers of tweed fabric evoking Marie Antoinette or perhaps the Snow Queen.\n\nLarge blond and dark wigs added to the queenly vibe - accessorized with an occasional tulle veil in a nod to bridal couture.\n\nBrowne continues to redefine Paris Fashion Week with displays that are as much about the visual concept as they are the ready-to-wear.\n\n___\n\nSCHIAPARELLI\u2019S TROPES OF DISPLACEMENT\n\nThere have been fits and starts since the famed house of Elsa Schiaparelli - the archrival of Coco Chanel - was relaunched some six years ago.\n\nNow, with designer Daniel Roseberry in place, the house associated with couture took one more trepidatious step into ready-to-wear.\n\nThe outcome left guests inside the Place Vendome presentation smiling.\n\nThis season plunged into the universe of the eccentric house founder, who, the brand informed guests, once swallowed flower seeds to try to become a flower as a little girl.\n\nThis naivety and playfulness were apparent in all of the 20 looks: From a beautifully-proportioned signature shocking pink geometric pant suit, to a soft jacket with an eye-popping yellow and orange fringe.\n\nThe designs were mainly structured and sophisticated with hints of Surrealism. (Elsa was friends with Salvador Dali.)\n\nA thick snaking serpent in gold made for a standout necklace, and the house said it had scanned human hair, pool tiles, and even brown paper bags in order to print them all on silk satin.\n\nRoseberry said he channeled \u201cSurrealist tropes of displacement \u2026 the everyday and prosaic meeting the exquisite and rare.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThomas Adamson on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ThomasAdamson_K\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A less-is-more philosophy at Valentino had celebrity guests, including American singer Camila Cabello and model Naomi Campbell, vigorously applauding.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Thomas Adamson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/aptopix_paris_fashion_s_s_2020_valentino_20937_c0-140-3360-2099_s1770x1032.jpg?8d8aa9e3c765abd511d98c2d74f2a063c1e850c7", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
