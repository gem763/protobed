And that did not end well as City lost their first game of the season.\n\nCity struggled midweek against Dinamo Zagreb and it was only an injury-time Phil Foden goal that ensured a 2-0 victory for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side.\n\nGuardiola said they would not underestimate their opponents. \u201c[In the European Champions League], they took an incredible result. I saw the game and they were so solid, as expected.\n\n\u201cAt the end, they have a team to make you suffer in the Premier League. They know exactly what they have to do. Three or four seasons together and there is a really impressive defensive structure. We have to be smart to take a result,\u201d said Guardiola.\n\nChelsea also enjoyed success in the Champions League, winning 2-1 at Lille, with in-form Tammy Abraham scoring his eighth goal in seven matches. They are away this afternoon at struggling Southampton, who once again seem to be staring a relegation battle in the face.\n\nAbraham\u2019s form has caught the eye of England coach Gareth Southgate, who picked the 22-year-old for the Three Lions\u2019 forthcoming Euro qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.\n\nIt is always a privilege to be wanted by both nations Tammy Abraham\n\nAlthough Abraham played in friendly draws with Germany and Brazil in 2017, as well as for England youth teams, he remains eligible for both England and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is always a privilege to be wanted by both nations,\u201d he said after scoring Chelsea\u2019s opener against Lille. \u201cI love both nations and I am clearly doing something right for Chelsea. I am focusing on the club. My time will come.\u201d\n\nSouthgate\u2019s call-up might have ended his indecision, but Chelsea fans will be happy to hear that he is concentrating on the club.\n\nArsenal, meanwhile, enjoyed a convincing 4-0 win in the Europe League against Standard Liege, with Unai Emery playing several fringe players. One of them, midfielder Gabriel Martinelli, scored twice.\n\nThe Brazilian, who has played all of seven minutes in the Premier League this season, also scored twice in the League Cup against Nottingham Forest and should be edging closer to getting off the bench.\n\nArsenal are at home against Bournemouth in a match they are expected to win, even though The Cherries have had a terrific start to the season with three victories and two draws from their opening seven matches. Struggling Newcastle, who have only Watford behind them on the table, are at home to Manchester United.\n\nThe Reds were held to a goalless draw in the Europa League by AZ Alkmaar, a result that did little to lift the pressure off Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r.\n\nAlthough the Norwegian coach said that he felt his side played well, it was a view not shared by many fans as the club has won just five of the past 22 matches and calls for his sacking have increased. United have won none of their past 10 away games.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r, though, has received backing from United legend Ryan Giggs. The Welsh manager said that Solskjaer\u2019s position was not helped by the success that J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Guardiola were having.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough job at the moment and he\u2019s unfortunate in a way to be in the same era as J\u00fcrgen and Pep. J\u00fcrgen is in his fourth year at Liverpool. Pep established Man City during that time. Mauricio Pochettino has had six years with Spurs,\u201d Giggs said.\n\n\u201cOle has to be given time, too. You need that time to mould your team into the way you want them to play, although whether managers always get that time in this day and age is another thing.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool and Man City have been in top form, while Man United struggle and pile pressure on coach.", "authors": ["Peter Auf Der Heyde"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9315/c0a073e723974b2d8a1be0d0264ecced.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
