One explanation could be that the move was simply the market\u2019s reaction to a chart pattern many experts had their eyes on for months.\n\nAfter its June 26 price high at $13,880, Bitcoin formed a descending triangle, followed by multiple months of consolidation. Near the end of the pattern the digital asset plunged from $9,700 to $8,000, a $1,700 drop in a single day. Bitcoin\u2019s Sept. 24 tumble also occurred just one day after Bakkt launched its physically-settled Bitcoin futures product.\n\nFollowing the sharp correction, prominent crypto analysts Ledger Status, Tone Vays and Crypto Cred, provided insights on Bitcoin\u2019s wild price drop.\n\nWeekly Crypto Market Performance. Source: Coin360.com\n\nLedger Status explains the market was due for action\n\nAccording to crypto analyst and podcaster Brian Krogsgard, also known as Ledger Status on Twitter, Bitcoin was due for some activity. \u201cThe market needed a reason to move after three months of tight consolidation,\u201d Krogsgard told CoinTelegraph.\n\nDuring its breakdown, Bitcoin punched through an important moving average (MA), possibly accelerating the drop. \u201cThe breakdown was a break under the 20-week moving average, which in prior bear and bull markets has been a significant support and resistance line,\u201d Krogsgard explained.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTone Vays expressed hesitancy from the start\n\nAccording to popular analyst Tone Vays, the rationale for Bitcoin\u2019s bloody day actually started with its exuberant price run months earlier. \u201cThis entire run-up didn\u2019t seem right to me,\u201d Vays said in a Sept. 24 YouTube video.\n\nVays mentioned other crypto traders have pointed to alternative metrics to justify Bitcoin\u2019s parabolic move, such as the high volume seen on the asset\u2019s blockchain. Vays himself, however, simply sticks to price action. \u201cI\u2019m a price guy,\u201d he said. \u201cPrice is king, and the price did not make sense,\u201d he added.\n\nVays also pointed out that no fresh money has entered the market in the form of new participants. In contrast, when Bitcoin rocketed up to its all-time high close to $20,000 in 2017, the cryptocurrency space saw a flood of new entrants to the market as the asset gained significant public attention.\n\n\u201cIn the last six months, I have not met anyone that has started watching me in 2019,\u201d Vays said referring to his crypto-oriented social media content. \u201cEvery single person I met started watching me in 2017,\u201d Vays said, adding that he also picked up a small number of viewers near the beginning of 2018.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart.

Periods of consolidation generally follow strong surges in price, Cred explained in the video. After such consolidation, the price typically continues its journey in the same direction as the initial price move.\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s case, the price should have continued higher after its consolidation, according to Cred\u2019s teaching. As the market saw, however, Bitcoin\u2019s price did not continue upward but instead broke out to the downside. This move in price could indicate a lack of market strength, according to Cred, based on the fundamental aspects taught in his video and his comments on the Sept. 24 drop.\n\nCred looked at Bitcoin\u2019s consolidation as a range instead of a triangle, pointing toward horizontal support and resistance levels. \u201cSupport breaking is bearish; it\u2019s not good,\u201d the analyst said of Bitcoin\u2019s move down.\n\nCred also pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s Sept. 24 daily candle, noting that a close below the previous candle lows from the consolidation would paint a lower low on the chart, indicating a change in the trend. Additionally, the educator mentioned the pattern\u2019s lower limit lined up in confluence with other horizontal levels and the higher lows seen before the dump.\n\nThe Sept. 24 candle did indeed close as a fresh low relative to the other lows mentioned.\n\nBTC USD Daily Chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhere to next?\n\nBitcoin sits in the lower $8,000 range as it sets up for its next move, which Krogsgard noted possibly could be down to $5,000 or $6,000. Such a drop would signal the end of a complete measured move for Bitcoin, although, buyers have shown up to defend lower prices so far. \u201cThe 200-day moving average support at $8,400 and a high volume node at $7,900 offered a buffer where bulls must show up and/or reclaim, and thus far have done so to some degree,\u201d he explained.\n\nBullish scenario\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s price sits in limbo between lower prices and renewed upward momentum, the bulls need to regain a few key levels. \u201cIf $8,400 can be reclaimed, I think we could see a quick move up to retest the breakdown around $9,400,\u201d Krogsgard said. \u201cIf we then push above the consolidation breakdown, there is a strong chance for a renewed expansion to retest highs.\u201d\n\nBearish scenario\n\nUnfortunately for the bulls, the 200-day moving average could now be viewed as an opponent that needs to be defeated and turned into support once again. \u201cA more likely scenario is that the 200-day moving average acts as resistance now, and we consolidate for another couple of weeks, which would likely be a continuation pattern most likely to break to the downside and move us to the low $6,000s,\u201d Krogsgard said.\n\nEven if Bitcoin follows this route down to $5,000 or $6,000 the trend can still technically be seen as bullish. \u201cI maintain a long term bullish bias unless we lose the 200-week moving average (currently around $4,600 and moving upward), which has marked the bottom of the last two bear markets,\u201d Krogsgard said. The analyst also noted that prices under $6,000 might represent a notable opportunity to pick up more Bitcoin.\n\nIn the meantime, price action likely demands a watchful eye and continual evaluation. \u201cEverything between $6,000 and $8,400 requires active mid-timeframe trade management,\u201d Krogsgard said. If Bitcoin\u2019s price can rally back above the 200-day and 20-week moving averages, it would be quite bullish for the market, he added.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of (@benjaminpirus) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.
