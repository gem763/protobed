She died last year at the age of 91.\n\nTwo of the paintings portray the notorious railway entrance to the extermination camp which saw more than a million people die though mass extermination, starvation or disease.\n\nPeople are seen with faces full of anguish, their eyes are wide with fear and their mouths open in terror, reminiscent of Edvard Munch's The Scream painting.\n\nThe sky above the camp is daubed in furious fire-reds and yellows as ominous black smoke fills the sky; as part of the Nazi's grim procedure, hundreds of bodies were burned in crematoria after the victims had been gassed.\n\nOne of the paintings shows a crowd by the train tracks, divided into two groups, awaiting selection for the gas chambers, while another shows the vast area almost entirely desolate, save for bags of luggage and children's toys strewn about on the floor, abandoned by the victims.\n\nOne of the paintings shows a crowd by the train tracks, divided into two groups, awaiting selection for the gas chambers, the notorious railway entrance to the camp is seen in the background and the sky is filled with angry reddish colours and black smoke - it was painted by former inmate Edith Birkin n\u00e9e Hofmann, a Czech jew who was sent to the camp in 1944\n\nOne of the paintings shows a smaller gaunt figure, perhaps a woman or child, collapsed on the ground in another's arms (left), many of the prisoners died from undernourished, being worked to the death deliberately, and in another an elderly woman (right), a shawl around her head and a Star of David emblazoned on her chest, stands with her hands folded, looking exhaustively through the barbed wire fence.\n\nBirkin described the grim discovery of what the smoke was and how the sky was perennially red in an interview with the British Library.\n\n'When we asked what it is they told us, and we couldn't believe it.' Birkin said. 'Well the Germans didn't tell us, but other prisoners told us you know. \"What's this, what's this smoke, what's this fire, you know, why is the sky so red?\"\n\nBorn in 1927 in Prague, in 1941, artist Edith Birkin n\u00e9e Hofmann and her family were deported to the Litzmannstadt Ghetto in what is now the city of Lodz in Poland\n\n'What is this all about, you know, we couldn't understand. But then we were told, very soon we were told you know, and we saw these transports of people coming ... thousands and thousands of people.\n\n'And they never appeared again, they just disappeared into this building, you know. Somehow you know you just got used to it; you were there.'\n\nAnother of her works donated to the museum shows a sallow prisoner collapsed on a barbed wire fence, with a smoking chimney from the extermination camp spewing forth in the background.\n\nBirkin said: 'I evolved a pictorial language that enabled me to put my visions on canvas. It wasn't so much the cruelty or physical suffering that I wanted to record.\n\n'Most of all, I wanted to show what it felt like to be a human being, in the starved, emaciated strangelooking body, forever being separated from loved ones.'\n\nOne of the paintings shows a smaller gaunt figure, perhaps a woman or child, collapsed on the ground in another's arms, many of the prisoners died from undernourishment as they were worked to the death deliberately.\n\nThroughout many of these and other works by Birkin, who also wrote poetry about her experiences, the people she painted are depicted in vivid colours.\n\nShe said of her work: 'How many people stop to think that the six million dead were individual human beings with dreams of their own, each with a story to tell, each wanting to live? This is why the people in my paintings are depicted in different colours.'\n\nIn one of the works, an elderly woman with a shawl around her head and a Star of David emblazoned on her chest, stands with her hands folded, looking exhaustedly through the barbed wire fence.\n\nAnother image of the infamous central entrance shows the area almost entirely desolate, save for bags of luggage and children's toys strewn about on the floor, abandoned by the victims\n\nThis Birkin painting shows a sallow prisoner collapsed on a barbed wire fence, with a smoking chimney from the extermination camp spewing forth in the background\n\nAgnieszka Sieradzka from the museum's art collection department, said the works present life in the camp, punishments, deaths during escape attempts, marches of death and recollections and portraits of people the artist remembered.\n\nShe said: 'The bright colours and wildly deformed characters provoke anxiety and fear. They are a metaphor for the pain and suffering through which the artist must have gone.\n\n'In conjunction with the poems that accompany them, the pictures represent the extremely personal witness account of a woman who went through the hell of the concentration camps.'\n\nBorn in 1927 in Prague, in 1941, artist Edith Birkin and her family were deported to the Litzmannstadt Ghetto in what is now the city of Lodz in Poland.\n\nIn 1944 she was transferred to Auschwitz II-Birkenau before being sent to the Gross-Rosen sub-camp in Germany over 170 miles away in what became known as a Death March.\n\nThe 19 harrowing paintings were created after the war by former inmate Edith Birkin n\u00e9e Hofmann and have been donated to the Auschwitz museum in Poland following her death last year\n\nShe was later liberated by British troops and after the war, returned to Prague where she discovered that none of her family had survived the Holocaust.\n\nShe first moved to Northern Ireland where one of her sisters had sought refuge before moving to England, where she studied to become a teacher, later marrying and adopting three children.\n\nIn the 1970s Edith Birkin began to study art and exhibiting her collections.\n\nHer daughter Amanada Steart said: 'Art for my mother was a way to fight the trauma she suffered after the war ... I know this is where my mother's paintings will be forever safe.'\n\nMs Steart added: 'My mother wanted to pass on the paintings to future generations so that things like Auschwitz would never happen again so that people would not have any prejudices because towards a different faith or race.'\n\nBirkin died in 2018 at the age of 91.", "description": "The 19 harrowing paintings were created after the war by former inmate Edith Birkin, a Czech jew who was sent to the camp in 1944 and who moved to England after she was liberated.", "authors": ["Ed Wight In Poland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/15/19746938-0-image-a-110_1571151513612.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
