The first 18 years in the lives of the children of these parents have become an expensive, extended college preparation course.\n\nIt is surely true that this imposes enormous stress on the child or young adult in question, and possibly on the whole family. As one remedy, Mr. Markovits suggests that highly selective schools should \u201cmodestly increase the number of rich students\u201d admitted, in order to \u201crelax competition among rich applicants.\u201d This is a regressive proposal, but it flows naturally enough from a concern about the plight of the overstretched children of the elite classes. To be fair, he also wants them to admit more poor and middle-class students, by expanding their class sizes.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with parents spending a lot of money on their children. If they want to pay for them to attend a highly selective private college, religious institution or small liberal arts college, it\u2019s their money. The problem is not so much that rich people are spending as much as they are on these goods \u2014 although that, too, is absurd. It is that they have begun to feel burdened by these costs and everything that leads up to them, all of which they have convinced themselves are unavoidable.", "description": "", "authors": ["Richard Reeves", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Rich-Meritocracy-Pity.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
