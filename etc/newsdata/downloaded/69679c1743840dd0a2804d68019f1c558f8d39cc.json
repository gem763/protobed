They arrived an hour and a half later, and she was no longer in her house.'\n\nMr Sanchez also said that the flooding was extremely sudden and that at 11.30am the river was high but not dangerous but by 1pm it had burst its banks.\n\nOfficials said later however that it was not clear if the two other reported deaths were directly linked to the flooding.\n\nIn the Gard region, a man in his nineties was killed Wednesday when his car came off the road.\n\nAuthorities in the Pyrenees-Orientales prefecture told AFP that a homeless man was found dead on Tuesday. An enquiry was underway to determine the cause of his death.\n\nAround 700 homes remain without power in Herault and Gard, and the flooding could halt train services across much of the area until at least November 4, the SNCF train operator said.\n\nDays of heavy rains have caused rivers to burst their banks in the south of France, leading to flooding in Villeneuve-les-Beziers (pictured)\n\nAround 700 homes are still without power amid the flooding, while waters have washed away the ground underneath railway tracks, halting the trains\n\n'This toll could have been higher,' Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said while inspecting the damage in Beziers, a city hit particularly hard.\n\nFlooding also killed a man in northeastern Spain this week, and five people were reported missing, officials said Wednesday.\n\nLandslides forced the closure of nearly 50 roads and halted train services in the region, as well as forcing the diversion of 37 flights, Spanish authorities said.\n\nPolice have now found the body of one of the five who were missing.\n\nIn Majorca, however, the search is continuing for a couple who may have been swept out to sea by a huge wave during the storms.\n\nA woman says she witnessed the incident and does not believe the man and woman got out.\n\nThey have not been identified but are believed to be 'foreign tourists' on holiday on the island. Police have been visiting hotels to see if any guests are missing.\n\nIn Tarragona on the Spanish mainland, the corpse of an elderly man was found at the mouth of the Francol\u00ed River, in the Port of Tarragona, and is believed to be one of the five missing as a result of the floods on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe body of the man was found south of the Castilla dock at 6.45pm last night by a Maritime Rescue vessel that had been searching the area.\n\nThe Civil Guard has taken charge of the investigation to confirm the identity of the victim.\n\nThe storms also claimed the life of another person in Arenys de Munt, Barcelona.\n\nTwo other residents of Tarragona, aged 72 and 73, were reported missing after going out in their car. The vehicle was found yesterday morning in the river but with no-one inside.\n\nPolice have also been searching for a Belgian truck driver whose vehicle has been found in the same area.\n\nAnd rescue teams have been combing the area of \u200b\u200bVilaverd, also in Tarragona, to look for a 69-year-old woman and her son, 42, whose mobile home was ravaged by the storm.\n\nCivil Protection says the flood emergency plan is still active.\n\nIn Mallorca, the search has resumed this morning to find trace of the couple reported to have fallen into the sea in Cala Esmeralda near the resort of Cala d'Or. Divers are out, as well as rescue boats and the emergency helicopter.\n\nA witness says she saw them on a viewpoint on Wednesday night before they were swept away and she immediately contacted the police.\n\nSo far, no hotels have reported anyone missing so it is assumed they might have been staying in private accommodation.", "description": "The 68-year-old, who has not been identified, was found near her home in the Languedoc-Roussillon region on Thursday and airlifted to hospital but died overnight, medics said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/07/20167956-0-image-a-11_1571984713853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
