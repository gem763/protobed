You use your eyes, your nose. If you look at something and think 'Wow, that looks good', you're not first of all thinking 'Is there beef in that?'\"\n\nNick White, head of the catering service said: \"This has involved making sacrifices, but is has been absolutely the right thing to do.\n\n\"It's about making the right choice easy.\"\n\nThe university said it had also stopped selling single-use plastic bottles, replacing them with glass bottles, cans or bio-degradable plastic bottles.", "description": "The University of Cambridge's catering service replaced beef and lamb with plant-based products.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/23E2/production/_108668190_hi014595728.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
