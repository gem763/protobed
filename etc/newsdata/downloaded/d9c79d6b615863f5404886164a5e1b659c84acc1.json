The newspaper claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s government was anxious about the synod\u2019s \u201cleftist agenda\u201d and its potential to embarrass Brazil on the world stage.\n\nAnother influential Brazilian general, Eduardo Villas B\u00f4as, claimed the synod would \u201ccertainly be exploited by environmentalists\u201d and vowed Brazil would not tolerate foreign \u201cinterference\u201d in its domestic affairs.\n\nBolsonaro \u2013 who is nominally Catholic but has aligned himself with conservative sectors of Brazil\u2019s Pentecostal church \u2013 has done little to conceal his own displeasure.\n\nIn June, he responded tetchily after the pope criticised \u201cthe blind and destructive mentality\u201d of those wrecking the rainforest. \u201cBrazil is the virgin that every foreign pervert wants to get their hands on,\u201d Bolsonaro told reporters.\n\nZon, who has lived in the region for nearly half his life, tried to shrug off reports that he had become a target for Brazil\u2019s intelligence services. \u201cI have friends in Abin,\u201d he laughed.\n\nHe also denied the synod was designed to undermine Bolsonaro. \u201cThis is my government. Why would I want to harm it?\u201d\n\nBut tensions have escalated in recent weeks following the international outcry over fires in the Amazon which saw one magazine brand Brazil\u2019s president \u201cBolsoNERO\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adolfo Zon, the archbishop of the Alto Solim\u00f5es, a diocese along Brazil\u2019s tri-border with Peru and Colombia, says: \u2018We must use, but not abuse Amazonia.\u2019 Photograph: Tom Phillips/The Guardian\n\nIn August, Brazilian bishops condemned their treatment in an open letter that said: \u201cWe regret immensely that today, rather than receiving support and encouragement, our leaders have been criminalized as enemies of the fatherland\u201d.\n\nThe letter made no explicit reference to Bolsonaro but condemned \u201cthe violent and irrational aggression against nature\u201d and the \u201cunscrupulous destruction of the forest, which is killing ancient flora and fauna with criminally started fires\u201d.\n\nErwin Kr\u00e4utler, the former bishop of the Amazon\u2019s Xingu region, told the Guardian this year\u2019s fires were \u201ca true apocalypse\u201d for which Bolsonaro was to blame.\n\nBolsonaro backers have hit back at what they paint as a left-wing plot to humiliate their leader and undermine Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon.\n\nIn a series of conspiratorial videos, the Bolsonarista blogger Bernardo K\u00fcster painted synod-bound bishops as meddlesome Liberation theologists aligned with prominent Brazilian leftists such as former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nThe synod\u2019s preparatory document, Instrumentum Laboris, was a \u201cdisastrous\u201d collection of \u201ceco-theology crap\u201d, K\u00fcster added.\n\nMauricio L\u00f3pez, the executive secretary of the group responsible for compiling that document \u2013 the Red Eclesial Pan Amaz\u00f3nica (Repam) \u2013 denied the synod was anti-Bolsonaro.\n\nAmazon fires are 'true apocalypse', says Brazilian archbishop Read more\n\n\u201cWe are not the enemy,\u201d L\u00f3pez insisted, claiming the summit was designed to denounce \u201coppressive structures and inequalities\u201d in the Amazon.\n\n\u201cIt is not about confronting any government \u2013 actually we want to collaborate,\u201d L\u00f3pez added, voicing alarm over rising deforestation and the plight of the Amazon\u2019s indigenous people.\n\n\u201cIt is about the future of those [Amazon] communities and also, at the end of the day, about the future of the planet.\u201d\n\nJoaqu\u00edn Humberto Pinz\u00f3n, a bishop from the Colombian Amazon, said attacks on the synod reflected how powerful political and economic actors were unhappy with efforts to raise awareness of the Amazon\u2019s ecological importance. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit them \u2013 neither the politicians, nor the business people, nor the owners of the big mining companies,\u201d Pinz\u00f3n said.\n\nZon was religiously diplomatic, not once mentioning the name Bolsonaro.\n\n\u201cThe synod is a political act \u2013 but with a small \u2018p\u2019. It isn\u2019t partisan,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThe Church isn\u2019t against anyone. It is against injustice.\u201d\n\nBut Zon\u2019s concern over Brazil\u2019s populist tack was palpable as he described how decades of social advances were now \u201cgoing down the plug hole\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday, for me, we are lost politically - in Brazil and in the world. Don\u2019t tell me the United States is a model \u2013 or England either,\u201d Zon said.\n\n\u201cI hope things will turn around \u2026 [because] today it seems to me \u2026 from what little I know of history, like the 1920s again, which was the basis for the arrival of fascism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is the extreme right growing today? Because people are searching for a saviour,\u201d Zon mused as he stared out across one of the world\u2019s mightiest waterways.\n\n\u201cBut saviours are dangerous. So far we\u2019ve only had one \u2013 and where did he end up? On the cross.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian travelled to the Amazon with support from the Red Eclesial PanAmaz\u00f3nica and Cidse, an international alliance of development agencies that includes the UK\u2019s Catholic Agency For Overseas Development (Cafod) and the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (Sciaf)", "description": "Gathering at the Vatican has triggered a political storm in Brazil as bishop denies undermining the government", "authors": ["Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e840e969b62216916207beb9797634d82c55b77b/0_0_5295_3177/master/5295.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39dfbf904149c7c9a1e3df99f8efe7df", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
