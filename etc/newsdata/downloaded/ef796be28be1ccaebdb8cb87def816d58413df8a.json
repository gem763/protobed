That might happen when the euro zone enters recession.\u201d\n\nEconomists now see a one-in-four chance of a euro zone recession in the coming year. The possibility of a no-deal Brexit in the coming weeks or months should also be concentrating minds across the 19 countries that use the euro.\n\nAdvocates of pro-growth policies are pegging their hopes on France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron emerging as the region\u2019s pre-eminent politician and incoming ECB chief Christian Lagarde doubling down on Draghi\u2019s lobbying of debt-averse northern governments.\n\nEurope\u2019s response to the crisis of a decade ago \u2014 protracted austerity combined with massive central bank stimulus and still-unfinished banking reforms \u2014 saved the euro but has left many of its economies numbed. Euro zone growth was just 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nWhile the ECB\u2019s 2.6 trillion euro stimulus program may have helped kick-start a post-crisis recovery of sorts, deep cuts to public spending are blamed for exacerbating poverty and shredding Europe\u2019s welfare safety nets.\n\nStung by the rise of anti-establishment parties across the continent, and with regional powerhouse Germany on the brink of recession, governments are starting to act.\n\nIn Angela Merkel\u2019s last months as German chancellor, politicians in Berlin are for the first time in years publicly questioning a self-imposed balanced budget rule and exploring ways to spend off-budget.\n\nIn its first budget since the \u201cyellow vest\u201d street protests began last year, France will this week offer 9 billion euros of tax cuts and put on hold some earlier debt-cutting promises.\n\n\u201cThe priority now is to address the totally justified anger of those who are not making ends meet,\u201d Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin told Le Parisien daily.\n\nEven more eye-catching was last week\u2019s announcement by the Netherlands, one of the euro zone\u2019s fiercest advocates of fiscal probity, of new spending on health and housing. An ambitious national investment fund will be launched there next year.\n\nAnd Italy\u2019s new government has signaled it will deliver an expansionary 2020 budget while it drums up support for its campaign to re-focus the EU\u2019s budget rules to promote growth.\n\nBut hard evidence of a game-changing shift remains absent, even as record-low debt costs have opened the door to an estimated 140 billion euros of spending by the end of 2021.\n\nWISHFUL THINKING\n\nMerkel on Friday had the chance to use domestic concern about climate change as cover to issue new debt to re-set the economy on a green path and inject some short-term stimulus.\n\nBut the plan announced, offering a headline figure of 50 billion euros of new measures but in a budget-neutral package spread over four years, fell short of some expectations.\n\n\u201cWe think any boost to demand would be too small to make much difference to short-term growth prospects in the euro-zone as a whole,\u201d Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics wrote in a note entitled \u201cWishful thinking about German fiscal policy\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the package fell well short of the stimulus announced by Merkel\u2019s coalition in 2009/10, worth 1.5% of GDP.\n\nAnd while there was much excitement at media reports that the Dutch government would funnel 50 billion euros \u2014 6% of GDP \u2014 into its proposed investment fund, the final announcement omitted any specific figure.\n\n\u201cThe Dutch did not give Draghi a mind-blowing farewell present,\u201d noted Marcel Klok, senior economist at ING bank.\n\nEuro zone finance ministers agreed this month that fiscal policy must \u201cplay a part\u201d in countering the downturn but made clear they planned no coordinated stimulus like the 200 billion euro package agreed in 2008 after Lehman Brothers collapsed.\n\nChristian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reform said it was clear from resistance within the bloc to a common budget to help out euro zone nations in difficulty that there is limited appetite to shake up the current EU framework.\n\nMoreover Italy\u2019s push for \u201cgreen\u201d investments to be exempted from national deficits has got short shrift in Brussels, a source close to the matter said, adding that any flexibility would be no more than 0.25 GDP points of the structural deficit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the review of fiscal rules will get far,\u201d said Odendahl. \u201cThe political dynamic in Europe has not shifted.\u201d\n\nSome think that may change if the French get their way.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nAs the close of the Merkel era allows Macron to emerge as the region\u2019s de facto leader, France is already pushing the idea of a \u201cgrowth compact\u201d while expressing vocally its concerns about the German slowdown.\n\nMany expect his compatriot Lagarde to amplify Draghi\u2019s call for fiscal support when she arrives at the ECB next month.\n\n\u201cShe will have to do a lot beyond simple monetary policy to persuade governments to play their role,\u201d said Legrain.", "description": "Mark John, European Economics Editor", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432084043&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1YV", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
