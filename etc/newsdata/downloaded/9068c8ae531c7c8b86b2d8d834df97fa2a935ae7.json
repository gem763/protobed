This is not what I would have told you a month or two ago, honestly. It\u2019s surprising because there are really important storylines for everything Microsoft is set to announce. Let\u2019s just strafe a few of them before digging into ARM.\n\nTake the Surface Pro, for example. Microsoft hasn\u2019t changed the overall design in years, so it feels overdue for a bezel-killing update. At the very least, Microsoft will hopefully bow to the inevitable and include a proper USB-C port on it.\n\nThe potential dual-screen device hits on so many long-running Microsoft stories I can\u2019t even begin to list them all. There\u2019s the ancient history of the Courier concept, the old history of Microsoft trying and failing to make Windows Phone successful, and the recent history of hardware boss Panos Panay hinting that Microsoft needs to do something in mobile, even if it\u2019s not specifically a phone.\n\nCommand Line is The Verge\u2019s daily newsletter about personal tech.

A lot will ride on the rumored \u201cLite\u201d version of Windows \u2014 which has its own dubious Windows S mode predecessor to leave behind, and potential competition with Chrome OS to look ahead to.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Surface Laptop. Any heads-up competitor to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro is worth paying attention to right now. Sure, Microsoft has the Surface Book line, but the Surface Laptop line is much more mainstream. It also, as I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be reminded of this week, has an excellent keyboard. Plus, the idea of Microsoft potentially leaving Intel processors out of one of its flagship devices is definitely going to cause a stir.\n\nSo why, with all those rich veins of tech analysis to mine, am I most interested in the ARM-based Surface? Because it\u2019s the future of mainstream Windows computers, and Microsoft had better not screw it up.\n\nThe benefits of switching to ARM are manifold. The main one is battery life, which is often rated above 20 hours for a laptop. That\u2019s substantially better than anything Intel currently has to offer. It also makes it significantly easier to add LTE options (and, presumably, 5G) to hardware. ARM processors also tend to run cooler than x86 processors, which frees up manufacturers to experiment with different (read: thinner and lighter) form factors.\n\nSo: longer battery life, easier cellular integration, and thinner devices. As nice as the Surface Pro can be, there is a limit to how much it can improve in those areas, and that limit\u2019s name is x86.\n\nThe switch to ARM is also exciting precisely because we know of a tablet that runs on an ARM processor that\u2019s so fast and powerful that it flat out smokes comparably priced laptops in benchmarks. That tablet, of course, is Apple\u2019s iPad Pro. It\u2019s so fast that everybody has been assuming that Apple will switch the Mac over to an ARM processor sometime soon.\n\nIn principle, there\u2019s no reason an ARM-based Windows tablet couldn\u2019t reach similar heights of performance. And Microsoft will surely feel pretty good about getting the Surface on ARM before the Mac makes the change over.\n\nMicrosoft is making the right bet by going with ARM because it needs to find something that can be more innovative than Intel. Getting ARM right simply opens up so many more opportunities for Microsoft than sticking with Intel does. It\u2019s not just making thinner tablets that could go up against the iPad. It\u2019s completely different form factors \u2014 that dual-screen device, for example, would be a good candidate.\n\nChrome OS continues to be a thorn in Microsoft\u2019s side \u2014 especially in the education market. ARM could help drive the cost of Windows machines down while keeping overall quality up (that last part is vital so as to avoid flashbacks to the netbook era).\n\nThat all sounds great, but you know that there\u2019s a \u201cbut\u201d coming. Here it is: to date, ARM-based Windows laptops have been bad. They\u2019re slower and still have some compatibility issues to work though.\n\nSo while ARM is the right bet, it\u2019s also a very risky bet. As Microsoft\u2019s first modern ARM-based Surface, it needs to be fast enough for most people\u2019s everyday use \u2014 and I mean without any slowdowns for most tasks. That wasn\u2019t quite the case with the Surface Go, which could handle simple tasks, but was far too easy to bog down. Reportedly, Intel talked Microsoft out of using ARM last year with the Surface Go. Maybe that was right for the Go, but I can tell you from personal experience that it meant battery life has been really disappointing.\n\nThen there was the very first Surface (aka the Surface RT), which also ran ARM. The original version of this article didn\u2019t mention it, which was a stupid oversight especially since I was literally at that launch event personally. That Surface was a classic example of launching before everything was ready: it was too slow running apps and didn\u2019t have enough native apps to work well. (I regret the error in the previous paragraph from the original piece and thank to Eric for the email about it.)\n\nMicrosoft needs the Surface to show the way to the rest of the industry once again, this time with ARM\n\nWith a big processor change and eye-popping battery numbers, I bet more people will be tempted to buy this ARM Surface than the Go. That means more pressure on Microsoft to deliver something that\u2019s fast enough. And that pressure will be compounded because whatever Microsoft releases is bound to end up being compared directly to Apple\u2019s iPad Pro.\n\nSo far, we haven\u2019t seen evidence that any ARM-based Windows machine is really up to that challenge.\n\nSupposedly, salvation for Windows on ARM is coming in the form of the Qualcomm 8cx chip. I have no idea if that\u2019s what Microsoft will go with and on top of that, nobody has any idea if the 8cx will really be as good as promised. The only laptop using it we\u2019ve laid our hands on is the Galaxy Book S. Early looks were promising, but nobody has actually reviewed it because it hasn\u2019t been released yet.\n\nWhatever chip Microsoft chooses, it needs to deliver something that can convince lots of users that it\u2019s powerful enough to be their main computer. The original idea for the Surface was to show the rest of the industry how to make better Windows computers. Now Microsoft needs to do it again with ARM.\n\nToday on The Verge\n\n+ Microsoft Surface event: rumors, leaks, and what to expect\n\nA very good list from Tom Warren. I know you\u2019re expecting me to opine on the potential of a folding, dual-screen device \u2014 but I won\u2019t do that today. Instead, I want to focus on something else: that ARM-powered Surface. It is Microsoft\u2019s biggest opportunity and also its biggest risk.\n\n+ Google\u2019s Project Jacquard is available on new Levi\u2019s jackets\n\nI wear a Levi\u2019s Trucker Jacket (or a knockoff thereof) nearly every day. I am obsessed with smartwatches and wearables and gadgets. If there\u2019s an ideal customer for this jacket, it is me. So I reviewed it and am impressed with how much the technology has progressed in the past couple years \u2014 but not so impressed that I would spend the extra money for the Jacquard version of this jacket.\n\n+ HP\u2019s Spectre x360 13 seems like an improvement in almost every way\n\nHP is making really good-looking and unique laptops \u2014 and that OLED option is really tempting. I was all set to rage about how much I would want this laptop if weren\u2019t for the fact that HP obstinately refuses to include Precision Touchpad drivers, but \u2014 wonder of wonders \u2014 it does. It\u2019s always dangerous to assume there isn\u2019t a deal-breaking problem on a just-announced laptop, so wait for reviews. Still: this could give whatever Microsoft announces a run for its money.\n\nJust Elon Musk things\n\nElon Musk aims to put SpaceX\u2019s Starship in orbit in six months\n\nLoren Grush provides essential context for the \u201cprototype\u201d Starship in this story, but graciously refrains from listing the 100 times Musk has overpromised on a timeline in bullet point form.\n\n\u201cThis is going to sound totally nuts, but I think we want to try to reach orbit in less than six months,\u201d Musk said. \u201cProvided the rate of design improvement and manufacturing improvement continues to be exponential, I think that is accurate to within a few months.\u201d\n\n+ Here are some pretty photos, too: SpaceX\u2019s massive Starship test rocket shines in Boca Chica, Texas\n\n+ Tesla\u2019s Smart Summon feature is already causing chaos in parking lots across America\n\nThis is going to be a fun new way for everybody to figure out who\u2019s liable for accidents. And by \u201cfun\u201d I mean \u201cthousand-yard-stare inspiring.\u201d\n\nToday in Pixel leaks\n\n+ Android 10\u2019s impressive Live Caption feature will likely launch on Pixel 4\n\nThis is legit the best thing about Android 10. It\u2019s a win for accessibility and a win for people who just want to see what the YouTubers are saying without having to turn sound on. I increasingly leave closed captioning on for all television that I don\u2019t care about turning into a cinematic experience, and I expect I\u2019ll be doing the same on phones.", "description": "The ARM-based Surface is the future of mainstream Windows computers, and Microsoft had better not screw it up.
