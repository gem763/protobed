Besides imposing new sanctions on the IRA and the private property of six of its employees, Treasury officials today also went after the private possessions of Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the IRA's founder and primary financier.\n\nMore specifically, US officials imposed sanctions on three companies that Prigozhin uses to manage three planes and a yacht.\n\nThe first is Beratex Group Limited, a company registered in the Seychelles, which the Russian oligarch uses to manage a private jet with the tail number of M-VITO, and a private yacht under the name of St. Vitamin.\n\n\"Beratex originally purchased M-VITO in 2012, and since then, photographs on social media accounts have shown that Prigozhin's family have used the plane,\" Treasury officials said. \"Between 2017 and 2018, M-VITO conducted numerous flights throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Europe to include Sudan, the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Ethiopia, Libya, Syria, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Armenia, Germany, Spain, and Russia.\"\n\n\"In addition to M-VITO, Beratex is also the registered owner of St. Vitamin, a yacht the company acquired in 2014,\" officials added. \"Prigozhin's family has vacationed on St. Vitamin, as evidenced by photographs posted on social media accounts.\"\n\nImage via Anna Zvereva/Flickr\n\nSecond, Treasury officials also imposed sanctions on Linburg Industries LTD, another Seychelles incorporated company, which Prigozhin used to manage and operate VP-CSP, a private jet registered in the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe third company is Autolex Transport Ltd. Also incorporated in the Seychelles, US officials said Prigozhin's employees used this company to arrange for the purchase of M-SAAN, a private jet registered in the Isle of Man.\n\nAs a result of today's sanctions, US entities are prohibited in engaging in transactions with these companies. In addition, if these properties enter US jurisdiction, they are also to be seized.\n\n\"The identification of these aircraft and vessel serves as a warning to those who continue to provide M-VITO, St. Vitamin, VP-CSP, and M-SAAN landing rights or other general services,\" Treasury officials said. \"By continuing to service these aircraft and the vessel, providers of such services run the risk of facilitating or supporting Prigozhin's nefarious activities and may also be subject to future sanctions.\"\n\nIn addition to the three companies, the US Treasury also imposed sanctions on six other individuals it identified as IRA employees: Dzheykhun Nasimi Ogly Aslanov, Mikhail Leonidovich Burchik, Vadim Vladimirovich Podkopaev, Vladimir Dmitriyevich Venkov, Igor Vladimirovich Nesterov, and Denis Igorevich Kuzmin.", "description": "US Treasury takes new approach to imposing sanctions on IRA's owner.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/30/7e75a267-9529-41ca-8503-796203856dc3/thumbnail/770x578/cfe96e2f4e7b332b5652a2fc570179ee/ira-yacht.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
