His hooking deputy Juli\u00e1n Montoya, consequently, has spent most of his international career on the bench: this was only his seventh start in 57 Tests. His hat-trick of tries inside the game\u2019s first 26 minutes, therefore, gives Mario Ledesma a tricky selection dilemma, particularly given how Argentina perked up in the second half of the French game after a dire start and faded after Creevy came on in the 45th minute.\n\nArgentina's Rugby World Cup win over Tonga a tale of two halves Read more\n\nThe 25-year-old Montoya now has six tries in his last nine appearances and the bearded forward would be a candidate for most other international teams in the world. Only one other hooker, Keith Wood, has scored more tries in a single game in World Cup history. Given Ledesma was a hooker himself and never managed a single try in 18 World Cup appearances, it will be fascinating to see whether he sticks with the status quo.\n\nMain strengths\n\nThe Pumas continue to possess better players than their recent results would suggest. Tonga wheeled out 11 of the same starting line-up beaten 35-3 by England in Sapporo yet the Pumas had already eased into an uncatchable 28-7 lead by half-time.\n\nAdmittedly, they were assisted by an initially muted Tongan performance, but when the Pumas get an opportunity close to the line they have a strong mauling game and some tricks up their sleeve. Instead of opting for a straightforward penalty early on, they went instead for a nifty lineout move which saw scrum-half Tom\u00e1s Cubelli set off left on a persuasive decoy run, diverting attention from the blindside where the ball was swiftly returned to an unmarked Montoya who scored in the corner. It showed the Pumas are capable of thinking smart and do not solely rely on brute force.\n\nPotential weaknesses\n\nThis was the Pumas\u2019 first win in 11 Tests. They are not exactly oozing confidence, underlined by a total of just nine tries in their last eight Tests. Their missed tackle count and ball retention increasingly disrupted their rhythm and, against better opponents, such little mistakes will cost them. \u201cTo have lost the ball so many times and miss so many tackles ... it will be very difficult if we do that against England,\u201d Ledesma said.\n\nOn a warm, humid, energy\u2011sapping afternoon, they also visibly ran out of steam in the second half; stringing 80 minutes of good rugby together continues to be an elusive concept.\n\nDefensively out wide they also looked vulnerable at times, with Leicester\u2019s Telusa Veainu twice scoring tries despite the presence of several Argentina players in extremely close proximity. Veainu has wonderful feet but England will look at some of Mat\u00edas Moroni\u2019s positioning and, if he plays, look to try and put him under pressure, whether by kicking in behind him or running at his inside shoulder.\n\nThere is no question the Pumas would be a stronger side if the overseas-based trio of Juan Imhoff, Santiago Cordero and Facundo Isa were all involved at this tournament.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nKey men\n\nIf Argentina are going to seriously worry England in Tokyo on Saturday they will need plenty of physicality in the forwards. Their no-nonsense 6ft 7in lock Tom\u00e1s Lavanini, who is heading for Leicester after this World Cup, was lucky not to receive a yellow card for the shoulder charge that prevented David Halaifonua from scoring in the left corner but his height and attitude will be important against England. His second-row partner Guido Petti, who played on despite a slight second-half knock to his shoulder, is another important presence, as is the hard-working captain, Pablo Matera, and the openside Marcos Kremer.\n\nNot many props, either, get the better of Saracens\u2019 tighthead Juan Figallo. Given some forward momentum, the Pumas backs will not be afraid to try their luck but neither of their two fly-halves, Benjam\u00edn Urdapilleta and Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez, are currently taking games by the scruff of the neck.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn this evidence England should not be overly worried, with the Pumas\u2019 head coach Ledesma admitting \u201ca lot of work\u201d will be required this week. The biggest danger is hiding in plain sight: Argentina, having been beaten by France, will almost certainly miss out on a quarter-final place should they lose. A sense of desperation allied to the passion generated by their wonderful supporters can be a powerful combination.", "description": "The England head coach did not travel to Hanazono to watch next Saturday\u2019s opponents but the Pumas will have given him plenty to ponder", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fcb92ed80830eaa6317fecdaca66eadec923758/461_648_2223_1334/master/2223.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ba34ed5d51dfab4290b1bee0eb6d8eb9", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
