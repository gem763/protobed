Wales's game against Uruguay and USA versus Tonga were also cleared, but Namibia against Canada in Kamaishi was called off.\n\n\"The decision was taken following a comprehensive assessment of the venue and associated infrastructure on Sunday morning in partnership with the host city,\" organisers said in a statement.\n\nThey urged fans to \"check travel operator information before departing and plan to arrive early as it may take longer than usual to enter the stadium\".\n\nA moment's silence will be observed before Sunday's games to remember the victims of Hagibis, one of the most violent typhoons in recent years.\n\nJapan has been left reeling from the unusually large storm, with many people trapped by floodwaters and tens of thousands evacuating overnight.\n\nIreland's bonus-point 47-5 win against Samoa makes the Yokohama match a straight shoot-out between the hosts and Scotland to decide the final qualifier from the tightly contested Pool A.\n\nJapan are four points ahead in the table, putting them in the box seat to reach their first quarter-final. For Scotland, even a win might not be enough with a maximum two bonus points on offer for the losing side.\n\nTwo other matches far from the path of the storm will also go ahead as scheduled - the Wales-Uruguay clash in the far southwestern city of Kumamoto, and USA-Tonga in Hanazono near Osaka.\n\nBut tournament director Alan Gilpin said he had \"no option\" but to cancel Sunday's early match between Canada and Namibia in the northeastern town of Kamaishi due to significant typhoon damage.\n\nLandslides and flooding in the vicinity of the stadium and along access roads to the venue following torrential rain meant the game had to be scrapped on \"public safety\" grounds, organisers said in a statement.\n\nThe cancellation was a blow for the northern town of Kamaishi, whose hosting of World Cup games was a potent symbol of recovery from a 2011 tsunami disaster when it was nearly wiped off the map.\n\nIt also robbed Namibia of a chance to grab their first World Cup win and end their record run of 22 games at the tournament without a victory. Canada are without a win in their last 10 World Cup matches.\n\nHagibis made landfall on Saturday evening and barrelled across the country, bringing fierce winds and torrential rain.\n\nIt was a direct hit on Tokyo and Yokohama, a city of some three million just south of the capital.\n\nAcross the country, at least 11 people died and several others were injured or reported missing due to the storm, which dumped \"unprecedented\" rainfall.\n\nSevere flooding has already taken place with many rivers breaking their banks, including the Tama River which runs through Tokyo.\n\nOrganisers had earlier cancelled two matches planned for Saturday - England v France and New Zealand v Italy, both in the path of the storm.\n\nIt was the first time in the 32-year history of the Rugby World Cup that games had been scrapped, and raised criticism of the decision to hold the tournament during Japan's typhoon season.", "description": "Rugby World Cup organisers have given the go-ahead for Japan's crunch match against Scotland despite the fall-out from Typhoon Hagibis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4388/ec5cac3a85bc4d3f8bb019a1dc01ef3c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
