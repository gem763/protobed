At least eight people were killed and more than 20 others were wounded, authorities said Friday.\n\nMexico's president justified his government's decision to surrender Guzm\u00e1n.\n\n\"The capture of one criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people,\" he said during a news conference Friday. \"This decision was made to protect citizens.... We do not want deaths. We do not want war.\"\n\nBurnt out vehicles smoulder on Friday in front of a Scotiabank, a day after the street battles between gunmen and security forces in Culiac\u00e1n. (Augusto Zurita/The Associated Press)\n\nThrough a lawyer, the Guzm\u00e1n family released a statement saying simply that \"Ovidio is alive and free.\"\n\nThe decision to allow the wanted man to simply walk away from his captors seems certain to stoke tensions with the U.S. and other nations that co-operate with Mexico in the fight against drug cartels.\n\nChaos in Culiac\u00e1n\n\nThere were conflicting versions of how the arrest and subsequent release of Guzm\u00e1n came about. Both the Mexican army and the country's new National Guard, created by L\u00f3pez Obrador as part of his pacification program, were involved in the operation.\n\nWhile state authorities described a planned capture operation that went wrong, federal authorities suggested that police and soldiers had come upon Guzm\u00e1n's hideout unexpectedly.\n\nWhat is not in doubt is that the cartel reacted swiftly and violently to the capture.\n\nSocial media video and television footage from Culiac\u00e1n show cartel gunmen roaming apparently at will through the city's streets, which are filled with burning vehicles. Cartel trucks mounted with .30- and .50-calibre machine guns can be seen parked at city intersections.\n\nWatch as Mexican soldiers and cartel gunmen appear to negotiate in this video from local newspaper Noreste.\n\nState authorities say 50 prisoners remain at large after they either escaped or were freed by cartel members.\n\nThe death toll is nothing unusual by Mexican standards: 13 police officers were killed in an ambush in Michoac\u00e1n on Monday; Mexican soldiers killed 14 gunmen in another confrontation on Tuesday in Guerrero state.\n\nBut the decision to free Guzm\u00e1n and cede the streets of Culiac\u00e1n to the Sinaloa cartel is being seen by some in Mexico as a seminal shift in power between the government and drug cartels.\n\nHarsh criticism at home\n\n\"What we saw was a surrender,\" said Exc\u00e9lsior columnist Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez Men\u00e9ndez, \"and the ones left in control of the city of Culiac\u00e1n are the criminals.\"\n\nAnother observer worried that other cartels could now be expected to ramp up their violence against the Mexican state.\n\n\"We have gone from what seemed a failed state to a state that has surrendered and been subjugated by the firepower and destabilization of the drug cartels,\" commentator Salvador Garcia Soto wrote in El Universal.\n\nAt Friday's news conference, L\u00f3pez Obrador acknowledged that the decision to set Guzman free had been taken at the highest levels of his administration with his express consent.\n\nWhen asked if the state had shown weakness, he said that criticism came from \"those who are opposed\" to his government's policies.\n\nVideo footage here shows a gunman lying on the ground firing a weapon in the city of Culiacan, Sinaloa today. Rumors suggest that one of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons \u00cdvan Archivaldo has been captured and possibly killed following a fierce gun battle in the city.... <a href=\"https://t.co/ElCd94lc5n\">pic.twitter.com/ElCd94lc5n</a> \u2014@mexicoreporter\n\nAs Mexicans poured scorn on the government's claim that the action was taken to save lives, the president took to Twitter to quote the words of Mexican revolutionary general Felipe \u00c1ngeles: \"With dedication to the soldiers of Mexico.... Nothing is sacred except man. There is something fragile, weak, but infinitely precious, that we all must defend: life.\"\n\nMexico's embassy in Canada responded to CBC News by pointing to the explanations given by L\u00f3pez Obrador, and by his Secretary of Public Security Alfonso Durazo, who said, \"We are not interested in walking through life shrouded in a blanket of spilled blood. We are going to win the peace, but not by converting Mexico into a bigger cemetery than it has already been for so many years.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Mexican Embassy in Ottawa added that authorities have not ceded control of the country to the cartel.\n\n\"The authorities' decision to withdraw from the zone was to ensure the protection of the inhabitants of the region,\" he said. \"Neighbouring countries can of course trust that Mexico will maintain control of its territory and the rule of law.\"", "description": "Mexican authorities captured then liberated Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, one of the leaders of the Sinaloa cartel, after the cartel sent gunmen into the streets of state capital Culiac\u00e1n to confront government forces and sow mayhem.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Evan Dyer Has Been A Journalist With Cbc For Years", "After An Early Career As A Freelancer In Argentina.
