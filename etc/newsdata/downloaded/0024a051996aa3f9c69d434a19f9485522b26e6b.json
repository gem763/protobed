But there is an intent I think by all sides to try and find a landing zone that everybody can live with here.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he wants to strike an amended deal at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18 but that if that is not possible then he will lead the United Kingdom out without a deal.", "description": "Ireland says Brexit deal is not yet close but mood music has improved", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8J0HZ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
