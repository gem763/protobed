Of those, Reuters found around 4,300 under 5 years old and 481 under 1 year old.\n\nBlanca Aguilar, a 27-year-old mother from Guatemala, is living in a makeshift encampment of around 40 small tents cramped together in the back rooms of a church outside Tijuana, across the border from San Diego. Children can be heard coughing and crying throughout the night, she and other mothers told Reuters during a recent visit.\n\nWhen one gets sick, they all do, Aguilar said. Her two-year-old son Adrian has had a recurrent cough with wheezing, as well as bouts of diarrhea, since they arrived in August.\n\n\"He's been sick a lot,\" she said, adding that she suspects he may be developing asthma.\n\nRead more: The number of migrants arrested at the US-Mexico border is the highest it's been since 2007, new federal data show\n\nAnother mother at the same shelter, 34-year-old Marla Suniga from Honduras, said her 1-year-old daughter Montserrat recently had a convulsion due to a high fever and had to be taken to a hospital. \"She couldn't breathe,\" she said.\n\nSuniga said she fled violence in her home country but plans to return there because she fears for her daughter's life in Tijuana.\n\nDHS said it could not comment on individual cases.

Doctors and nurses visiting shelters and camps in Mexican border towns, however, told Reuters they have seen cases of chicken pox, scabies, respiratory infections, skin rashes, eye infections and gastrointestinal issues among children and adults.\n\nChildren under 5, and especially under the age of 2, are at high risk of serious flu complications, according to the US Centers for Disease Control, and the flu season is about to start.\n\nAmerican doctors and nurses volunteering in Tijuana with the Refugee Health Alliance hope to be able to provide flu shots in a few of the shelters there, but the effort is hard to organize, said coordinator Phil Canete. The vaccines need to be stored in cold, regulated conditions, and the Mexican government requires a physician licensed in Mexico to supervise the effort, as well as signed consent for every patient, he said.\n\nRead more: 'We've seen this coming': Why migrant children are dying in Border Patrol custody\n\nThe US government has said in guidance documents that migrants with known physical or mental health issues are not candidates for the MPP program. But advocates say it's not clear what qualifies as a medical exemption from MPP.\n\nJennifer Jimenez, a 30-year-old Salvadoran, said she arrived at the border in July with 11-year-old twins and her eight-month-old son Jacob, who was born with lungs that had not fully developed.\n\nAlthough she explained Jacob's condition to border agents, she said, the agents sent her and her children back to Ciudad Juarez, where the family ended up sleeping on the floor of a crowded shelter.\n\nReuters found that 1% of migrants assigned to MPP have so far been transferred out of the program.\n\nCentral American migrant children play with a mobile phone at the AGAPE shelter in Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico, in the border with the US, on June 27, 2019.

In May, nearly 85,000 family units - parents with kids - were arrested at the US-Mexico border, a monthly record. In August, the number of families arrested dropped by 70% after the administration ramped up MPP and other measures to deter migration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said that lax US asylum laws encourage people to show up at the border with their children. Before MPP, it was common practice to release arriving families into the United States to wait out their US court hearings \u2013 something Trump and others said allowed many migrants to disappear into the country to live illegally.\n\nBack in August, the Trump administration tried rolling out a new rule that would have opened the door to the indefinite detention of migrant children and end the two decades-old Flores Agreement that protects underage migrant kids after they arrive to the United States. But a federal judge blocked the rule from going into effect late last month, characterizing elements of it as \"Kafkaesque.\"\n\nImmigrant advocacy groups say most released immigrants show up for their court hearings. Some are suing to halt the MPP policy, and a federal appeals court \u2014 the 9th US Circuit \u2014 is due to rule on the case soon.\n\n'Nothing for them here'\n\nIn this March 14, 2019, file photo, a group of migrant families walk from the Rio Grande, the river separating the U.S. and Mexico in Texas, near McAllen, Texas, right before being apprehended by Border Patrol.

Most of the others were assigned to Texas courts: 6,800 to San Antonio and El Paso and 3,400 to Brownsville.\n\nJimenez, the Salvadoran mother, said that when she heard her family was being sent from El Paso to Ciudad Juarez, known for its high murder rate, \"it was like they threw a bucket of cold water on me. ..Mexico isn't a place I trust to go out alone with my three children.\"\n\nRead more: A look at what Mexico has done to limit the tide of migrants\n\nBrownsville is just north of Matamoros, in Mexico's Tamaulipas state, a violent battleground for drug cartels.\n\nFlorida resident Helen Perry, a nurse in the US Army Reserve who joined a volunteer aid group headed to Matamoros on Labor Day weekend, told Reuters she saw families camped out in donated tents - each with between 5 to 10 people sleeping inside - a few dozen feet from the border.\n\nOne family, with four small children, was curled up under a tree, she said. People lacked access to fresh water and proper restrooms and were bathing in the Rio Grande river, she said..\n\nOne baby Perry examined had a chronic eye infection and was beginning to develop scarring, threatening his vision. Another had a fungal rash under his arm so severe it limited his movement.\n\nPerry said she saw breastfeeding mothers so dehydrated that they could not nurse their babies and parents chewing up donated pizza into mush to feed their infants. Some children were showing early signs of malnutrition, she said.\n\n\"There is really nothing for them there,\" Perry said.", "description": "The Trump administration has ordered thousands of underage migrants, including more than 500 infants, to wait in Mexico for their asylum hearings.", "authors": ["Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0c8704af9097b70508b0f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
