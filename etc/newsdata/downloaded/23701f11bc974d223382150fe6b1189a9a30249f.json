For now, Xi appears inclined to sit back and watch Trump\u2019s mounting panic over the potential election-year consequences of his folly.\n\nInstead, Xi is considering whether to act on his regime\u2019s repeated threats to crush Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement by force. He has few other options to stop the mass demonstrations that have shaken the city this summer, which after 12 weeks are undiminished in strength. That\u2019s because he has no intention of meeting the protesters\u2019 demands for the resignation of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-Beijing executive and the staging of free elections.\n\nAnd he has something of a deadline: On Oct. 1, huge celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of his Communist regime are planned on the mainland. Counter-demonstrations in Hong Kong could spoil the show and cause Xi a humiliating loss of face.\n\nXi\u2019s media and military commanders have been threatening intervention for weeks. They\u2019ve tweeted propaganda videos of People\u2019s Liberation Army troops using machine guns against \u201crioters\u201d; they\u2019ve massed elements of the paramilitary People\u2019s Armed Police in the neighboring city of Shenzhen, where they\u2019ve been carrying out exercises. Fresh soldiers were conspicuously rotated to the existing PLA garrison in Hong Kong last week.\n\nThe assumption among many Western analysts has been that Xi is hoping that the mere threat of force will cause the movement to retreat. So far, it hasn\u2019t. On Saturday, protesters again battled police in Hong Kong\u2019s streets after a planned march was banned. A week ago, more than 200,000 people formed human chains across the territory to reiterate the demand for direct elections. The week before that, an estimated 1.7 million \u2014 nearly a quarter of the population \u2014 turned out.\n\nThe regime has tried less conspicuous measures of force, such as dispatching gang members to beat up protesters and infiltrating marches with provocateurs. It has put pressure on Hong Kong businesses to discipline employees who join the marches. On Friday, it arrested several of the best-known opposition leaders. So far, nothing has worked.\n\nXi knows that the costs of intervention, or of an imposition by Hong Kong authorities of a state of emergency, would be large, which is why it hasn\u2019t already happened. In addition to destroying the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model for Hong Kong \u2014 which Beijing still hopes to peddle to Taiwan \u2014 the economic price would be huge. Though Hong Kong represents only 3 percent of China\u2019s gross domestic product, some 60 percent of foreign investment in the mainland flows through the city, according to the Economist. Under U.S. law, the city is treated as a separate economic entity, allowing it to escape Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nIf an intervention were bloody, most or all of that could be lost. Yet Xi no doubt is listening to arguments such as that recently advanced by the Communist Global Times newspaper, which editorialized that China could more easily manage the economic and diplomatic consequences of a crackdown than it could 30 years ago, when the Tiananmen movement was shattered by tanks. \u201cChina is much stronger and more mature, and its ability to manage complex situations has been greatly enhanced,\u201d it said.\n\nMy guess is that the aftermath of a Hong Kong crackdown would be less like Tianamen, which wiped out the student-led democracy movement, and more like Communist Poland after the suppression of the Solidarity trade union in 1981. As in Poland, Hong Kong\u2019s freedom movement is supported by the vast majority of the population. It cannot be stamped out \u2014 only forced to move underground. At some point, it likely would reemerge, especially if it had international support.\n\nThat, sadly, is the missing element in Xi\u2019s calculus. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter bluntly warned the Soviet Union against the military intervention in Poland that it was then preparing, helping Solidarity to survive for 16 months. After Moscow settled for the imposition of martial law by the Polish Army, President Ronald Reagan imposed crippling sanctions and set up clandestine ratlines to help keep the movement alive.\n\nAs Xi has threatened Hong Kong, Trump repeatedly and publicly sympathized with him. Even under pressure from his advisers, the best he could do was muse that a crackdown would make it politically difficult for him to strike a trade deal. That\u2019s why, while the histories of this summer will not remember Greenland, they may record that Trump opened the way to the suppression of the most important freedom movement Communist China has known.\n\nRead more from Jackson Diehl\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "As China weighs how to crackdown on protests, will the United States support democracy?", "authors": ["Jackson Diehl", "Deputy Editorial Page Editor", "Columnist Focusing On International Affairs", "September At Pm", "Jackson Diehl Is Deputy Editorial Page Editor Of The Post.
