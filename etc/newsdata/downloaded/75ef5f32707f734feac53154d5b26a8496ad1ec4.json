Nor will it countenance attempts to influence or intimidate it, irrespective of who may attempt to do so,\" Mpati said.\n\n\"The Commission will continue with its work without fear or favour and reserves the right to take action, in accordance with the regulations, against any party who seeks to interfere in its work.\u201d\n\nRead: Judge rubbishes Surv\u00e9's claim that he is Gordhan's pal\n\nSurv\u00e9\u2019s Cape Town office was raided by the financial regulator the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) on Wednesday morning. The raid presumably is related to an investigation into transactions in AYO Technology \u2013 which is linked to Surv\u00e9 \u2013 for market manipulation.\n\nThe PIC invested R4.3bn in AYO before its listing on the JSE in December 2017, while AYO's assets were reportedly worth far less than that. The corporation launched a court bid earlier in the year to reclaim its investment.\n\nIn April, the Mpati commission heard that millions of rands from the PIC investment into AYO went to two companies linked to Surv\u00e9 the day after it was listed on the JSE.\n\nSurv\u00e9 has consistently denied any wrongdoing related to AYO, and blamed this week\u2019s raid on Gordhan. Surv\u00e9 alleges that he has \"sufficient evidence\" to show Gordhan was involved in the raid, but that this evidence will be presented at the \"appropriate time\".\n\n\n\nThe minister lawyer hit back at the accusations on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhat the South African public knows is that Mr Surv\u00e9 and his business entities have been the subject of the Mpati Commission of Inquiry. The attempt at deflecting attention from this, by making false and defamatory allegations against Minister Gordhan and others, will not assist him and others in being held accountable for possible transgressions of the law.\"\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s article, Surv\u00e9 claims that Gordhan\u2019s statement shows that \"he is either knowledgeable about the Mpati Commission or has a role in influencing its outcomes\".\n\nCompiled by Helena Wasserman\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Iqbal Surv\u00e9 accused Gordhan of trying to influence the commission of inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8597/c0a081d42940487eb5049555d637a692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
