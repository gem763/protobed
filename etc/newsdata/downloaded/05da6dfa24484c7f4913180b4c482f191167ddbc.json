Be that as it may, for the good of the party, he now holds the position and needs to embrace even those who feel alienated.\u201d\n\n\n\nHlabisa made the call to foster unity after there were allegations that some within the party\u2019s ranks were unhappy with top leadership \u201cbeing imposed\u201d on the delegates at the elective conference because the party\u2019s top seven were elected uncontested.\n\nIFP former chairperson Ziba Jiyane, who recently rejoined the party 14 years after he was unceremoniously forced out of its second most powerful position, was among the loudest voices expressing their displeasure in the lead-up to the conference.\n\nHe wanted to contest Hlabisa at the elective conference but was prevented from doing so on a technicality.\n\nThe party\u2019s national spokesperson said, as per party policy, a member was allowed to stand for election only after they had been a member for at least a year.\n\nMncwango said Hlabisa\u2019s other dilemma would be filling the shoes of outgoing leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.\n\nDie Burger\n\nThat Hlabisa had named Buthelezi as the party\u2019s president emeritus would go a long way in undermining his power within the party, Mncwango said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs far as I have heard, once Buthelezi says something, then no one goes against whatever he has said; this role [the party\u2019s president emeritus] that he has been given means he will still be actively involved in party meetings and decision-making processes. Hlabisa will therefore need to have a backbone and hold his own,\u201d said Mncwango.\n\nDuring the IFP\u2019s elective conference Buthelezi said that he would have preferred to take a break entirely from politics.\n\nHowever, he was willing to serve in any role that Hlabisa and the new party leadership saw fit and unambiguously declared that Hlabisa would be steering the ship.\n\nHlabisa lauded the outgoing Buthelezi, saying he had learnt a lot from him particularly traits such as being virtuous and upright, as well as being respectful.\n\nApart from fostering unity, Hlabisa said land reform was a key issue that needed his party\u2019s urgent attention.\n\nRead: Buthelezi's swan song: I have served IFP for 44 years and I have never served alone\n\n\u201cLand has social, spiritual and economic value, meaning the resolution of the land issue carries with it the promise of healing the wounds of the past,\u201d Hlabisa said.\n\nHe cautioned against handling the matter in a reckless manner saying it would have \u201cthe potential to deter foreign investment, ruining the agricultural sector and the economy\u201d.\n\nHe rejected critics of the Ingonyama Trust, a stance that was taken by his predecessor, saying \u201cit is those who haven\u2019t studied the merits of the trust and noted how it was the only example in the country of large parts of land having remained in the hands of the black majority, who are advocating its dispossession\u201d.\n\nHe reiterated that part of the new leadership\u2019s immediate focus would be growing the party\u2019s footprint beyond just KwaZulu-Natal and Johannesburg for the upcoming municipal elections in 2021.\n\n\u201cWe are looking towards the 2024 municipal elections as our main priority. But before we get there, we need to get through the 2021 municipal elections which we are sure of doing well in. Our recent performance in the national and provincial elections demonstrated that we are on the right track and we believe we will win municipalities in other provinces besides KwaZulu-Natal and Johannesburg,\u201d said Hlabisa.\n\nHaving been a councillor since 1995 until joining the KwaZulu-Natal legislature in May this year, Hlabisa is not in the national assembly and said it would stay that way as the party has faith in the crop of leaders now representing it in the Parliament.\n\nHlabisa, a teacher by profession, joined the IFP in 1978, three years after its formation in 1975.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nWhat do you think about the new IFP leader?
