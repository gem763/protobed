Obfuscate. Attack. Repeat.\n\nOne of the administration\u2019s first moves: the State Department on Tuesday barred Gordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, from appearing before a House panel conducting the impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\n\u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorney, Robert Luskin, said his client was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d that he wouldn\u2019t be able to testify. A whistleblower\u2019s complaint and text messages released by another envoy portray Sondland as a potentially important witness to allegations that the Republican president sought to dig up dirt on a Democratic rival in the name of foreign policy.\n\nTrump aides are honing their approach after two weeks of what allies have described as a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe. One expected step is a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejecting the inquiry because Democrats haven\u2019t held a vote on the matter and moving to all but ceasing cooperation with Capitol Hill on key oversight matters.\n\nThe strategy risks further provoking Democrats in the impeachment probe, setting up court challenges and the potential for lawmakers to draw up an article of impeachment accusing Trump of obstructing their investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, said that Sondland\u2019s no-show would be grounds for obstruction of justice and could give a preview of what some of the articles of impeachment against Trump would entail.\n\nBut as lawmakers seek to amass ammunition to be used in an impeachment trial, the White House increasingly believes all-out warfare is its best course of action.\n\n\u201cWhat they did to this country is unthinkable. It\u2019s lucky that I\u2019m the president. A lot of people said very few people could handle it. I sort of thrive on it,\u201d Trump said Monday at the White House. \u201cYou can\u2019t impeach a president for doing a great job. This is a scam.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats, for their part, issued a new round of subpoenas on Monday, this time to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and acting White House budget director Russell Vought. Pelosi\u2019s office also released an open letter signed by 90 former national security officials who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, voicing support for the whistleblower who raised concerns about Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate political foe Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cA responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed, thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhatever one\u2019s view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity. Simply put, he or she has done what our law demands; now he or she deserves our protection.\u201d\n\nThe House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees are investigating Trump\u2019s actions pressing Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, potentially interfering in the 2020 election. The former vice president, for his part, has accused Trump of \u201cfrantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me.\u201d Trump also withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nTrump and his team\u2019s initial strategy had been to try to undermine the credibility of the intelligence community whistleblower who first raised questions about Trump\u2019s conduct with Ukraine, just as they tried to undercut special counsel Robert Mueller and his team. They stressed that the whistleblower had only second- or third-hand information and alleged that the person misrepresented the president\u2019s efforts. But now a second whistleblower has come forward to corroborate the information, and a cache of text messages echoes the concerns that have been laid out.\n\nThe White House has struggled to communicate its message beyond Trump\u2019s angry public proclamations and an endless stream of tweets.\n\nIndeed, top officials were absent from the Sunday talk shows, and the sole White House official to appear in public on Monday dodged questions on the inquiry.\n\nJason Miller, who served as senior communications adviser on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and worked with outside allies on the response to the Mueller investigation, said allies need to be doing a better job defending the president on the airwaves and painting the impeachment inquiry as nothing but a politically-motivated, losing endeavor.\n\n\u201cI think Trump allies need a much better approach and aggressive approach to what we currently have,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe need to be making the argument on TV with legal scholars that impeachment is going nowhere and is just a political act.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s aides have ignored document requests and subpoenas, invoked executive privilege \u2014 going so far as to argue that the privilege extends to informal presidential advisers who have never held White House jobs \u2014 and all but dared Democrats to hold them in contempt.\n\nAt the same time, Trump\u2019s campaign, which has reported a fundraising surge since the impeachment inquiry, held a curiously timed briefing call with reporters Monday to trumpet its efforts to overhaul the delegate selection process to ensure there is no drama at the Republican National Convention. Trump campaign officials said the effort had nothing to do with concerns about fending off a primary challenge.\n\n___\n\nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj , Miller at https://twitter.com/zekejmiller and Lemire at https://twitter.com/JonLemire", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As House Democrats fire off more subpoenas, the White House has launched a high-stakes strategy to counter the impeachment threat to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/0b1e6c_trump-33642-donald-trump-mark-milley-mark-esper-president-donald-trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
