It was the caption that came underneath: \u201cThe Bluebella for Victoria\u2019s Secret campaign features a diverse set of models, including a transgender model and plus-size model,\u201d WWD first reported. (Their names are May Sim\u00f3n Lifschitz and Ali Tate Cutler, respectively.)\n\nThe images are less of a campaign and more of an apology. And if you ask many upset shoppers, the embroiled underwear chain has much to atone for: Victor\u2019s Secret has faced a host of challenges in the past year, most self-inflicted.\n\nIt began when former CMO, Edward Razek, made trans- and fatphobic comments to Vogue in November. His words set off a wave of backlash. Things got worse when an indie brand accused VS of copying its designs and, more distressingly, owner Les Wexner\u2019s ties to the late sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein came under scrutiny.\n\nThe head of stores, April Hoult, resigned on Thursday for undetermined reasons, CNBC reported. The same day, 50 people were laid off from the company, according to The New York Times.\n\nNow, the company known for its runway cast of \u201cangels\u201d has returned with its wings briskly beating, still trying to soar in a market that increasingly values reality over the \u201cfantasy\u201d VS used to proudly hawk.\n\nAs Fast Company reported this summer, #MeToo directly impacted VS\u2019 bottom line\u2014at the end of 2017, during the movement\u2019s heyday, sales fell from the previous year\u2019s $8 billion to $7.4 billion. One \u201cinclusive\u201d marketing campaign and a few flimsy new bra sets will probably do nothing to woo back disillusioned shoppers who left the brand to feel empowered elsewhere.\n\nBut just like supermodel Ming Xi got back up after falling on the Victoria\u2019s Secret runway in 2017, the brand hopes to rise again. After all, though its share of the lingerie market has tumbled in the past few years, it still has the biggest control at 24 percent.\n\nStill, the performative wokeness of the brand\u2019s attempted redo has been called out by many this week. Fashionista editor-in-chief Tyler McCall wrote on Twitter that Tate Cutler, VS\u2019 first plus-size model, \u201cdeveloped a reputation as being fat-shaming.\u201d Refinery29\u2019s Channing Hargrove called the hiring of Tate Cutler \u201ctoo little too late\u201d\u2014a sentiment widely repeated on social media.\n\n\u201cThis is the perfect example of Victoria\u2019s Secret reacting to the consumer, not being proactive,\u201d retail analyst Charcy Evers told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt appears very disingenuous, like [VS] is shifting their position all of a sudden and saying that because they hired a transgender or plus-size model, it means they\u2019re \u2018inclusive.\u2019\u201d\n\nEvers went on to explain that competitors like Aerie and Third Love have long championed relatable advertising. \u201cKeep this in perspective\u2014Aerie launched their campaign of \u2018real women\u2019 in 2014. That\u2019s five years ago. It took Victoria\u2019s Secret five years to [do the same]?\u201d\n\n\u201c Are diverse ads the right thing to do? Sure. Do I think that VS is doing it because their culture has fundamentally changed and they really mean it? Not so sure \u201d\n\nElizabeth Shobert, VP of marketing and digital strategy for StyleSage, also sees through the attempted rehab. \u201cAre diverse ads the right thing to do? Sure. Do I think that VS is doing it because their culture has fundamentally changed and they really mean it? Not so sure,\u201d she said, adding the campaign \u201cis still highly stylized\u201d and fairly generic.\n\nWhile Victoria\u2019s Secret execs pointedly hired models who represent the people they offended last year (check, check, check), the brand has yet to go all-in with their acceptance. According to WWD, Amy Hauk, who runs the brand\u2019s youth line Pink, said at an investor meeting, \u201cI know a lot of 50 year-old women that want to be 20. I have yet to meet a 20-year-old woman that wants to be 50.\u201d\n\nShe must have forgotten how old J.Lo, Jennifer Aniston, and Halle Berry are. With that type of mentality, at 42 years old, the brand is showing its age. As Shobert put it, \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret still has this aura of overt sexiness surrounding it, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but unfortunately there is something about it that still feels dated.\u201d", "description": "It's been a rough week\u2014and year\u2014for Victoria\u2019s Secret, which just released its first \u201cdiverse\u201d ad campaign. But some say the brand\u2019s overt sexiness still feels dated.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570826297/191011-victorias-secret-tease_o7ewwo", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
