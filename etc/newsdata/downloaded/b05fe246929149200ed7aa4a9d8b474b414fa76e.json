Not least the celebration of 50 years since Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, the Chinese space agency landed a rover on the far side of the moon \u2013 the first time it has ever been visited. They discovered a weird, \u2018gel-like\u2019 substance that is currently being probed by scientists.\n\nAnd even from right here on Earth, we\u2019ve seen some stunning pictures of the moon through various full moons and lunar eclipses that have taken place so far in 2019.\n\nHere are a few of our favourites:\n\nThe crescent moon sets behind Edinburgh Castle (Tom Duffin/Solent News & Photo Agency)\n\nThe moon rises above Roseberry Topping in North Yorkshire in a picture by Andrew Dawson, who spent two years trying to capture it.
