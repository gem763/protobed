Bond yields are down and stocks pay less and less \u201cdividend per dollar\u201d with each rally. But there\u2019s still one little-known corner of the investing world we can look to for safe yields up to 11.8%.\n\nBusiness development companies (BDC) provide debt and equity financing for small and midsize businesses. Banks, in recent decades, have deemed these types of lenders \u201ctoo risky.\u201d So, BDCs put on their big boy risk-evaluating pants and began to provide some powerful payouts that are backed by the cash flows of the firms they lend to.\n\nYield ETF Table\n\nDouble-digit yields are the norm, not the exception, in this extremely niche area of the market. Indeed, BDCs currently offer yields almost twice as high as high-yield bonds and triple what you\u2019re getting from real estate investment trusts (REITs) at the moment.\n\nBDCs\u2019 high-yield stature isn\u2019t anything new. These companies, just like REITs, are required to pay out 90% or more of their taxable income as dividends, so their businesses are income gushers by their very nature.\n\nBut the gap between BDC yields and other areas of the market has been widening over the past couple years as popular competing payouts get pancaked:\n\nBDC Yields Creep Higher While Others Tank\n\nYield Sector Chart\n\nSounds great, but what\u2019s the catch? Not all BDCs are created equal. Some are mere \u201cpaper payout tigers.\u201d Sure, they pay their dividends\u2013but they take the distributions out of their own net asset values (NAVs), which means their stock prices give back most (or all) of the payout. Which is pointless.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean. The VanEck Vectors BDC Income ETF (BIZD) is up 15% so far in 2019, but it\u2019s still deeply underwater across the past half-decade. This industry has too many issues to count: increased competition over the past few years, high costs from external managers, even fears of an incoming recession (which would wreak havoc on the smaller businesses they finance.)\n\nThere are so many weak links in the BDC industry that I wouldn\u2019t play the sector with a diversified fund. The few winners in the space get drowned out by a sea of losers. So today, I want to dig into three individual BDCs, boasting mammoth yields of 7.5 to 11.8%, to show you both the hazards and the high-quality high yields in this space.\n\nPennantPark Investment (PNNT)\n\nDividend Yield: 11.8%\n\nPennantPark Investment (PNNT) isn\u2019t exactly lacking for experience, boasting $10 billion in capital deployed over its lifetime and more than 180 partnerships with private-equity sponsors.\n\n(Quick side note: The beauty of BDCs is that they\u2019re virtually private equity companies themselves. They allow you and me to invest in privately held small businesses, but without traditional PE\u2019s $1 million-plus minimum buy-ins.)\n\nPennantPark provides exposure (typically through first- and second-lien debt) to companies that are owned by \u201cestablished middle market private equity sponsors with a track record of supporting their portfolio companies,\u201d and that typically generate between $10 million and $50 million of EBITDA. Portfolio companies at the moment include the likes of primary-care clinic operator Cano Health, marketing services firm Phoenix and glass-product fabricator American Insulated Glass.\n\nDespite its focus on PE support, as well as a fairly diversified portfolio, PNNT has been skidding for years. Here\u2019s a look at its net investment income (NII, an important profitability metric for BDCs) from the past four years:\n\n2015: $1.10 per share\n\n2016: $0.99 per share\n\n2017: $0.79 per share\n\n2018: $0.75 per share\n\nThe company is on pace for yet another disappointment, with 51 cents per share in NII through the first nine months of its fiscal year, down from 55 cents at the same point in 2018. That\u2019s bad on its face, but even worse when you consider that the company has paid out 54 cents per share in dividends so far in 2019.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nA sharp drop in NAV earlier this year has stoked more investor fear in PNNT. So has the Fed yanking the brake on interest rates, which doesn\u2019t help PennantPark\u2019s predominantly floating-rate debt investments. Let\u2019s move on.\n\nPennantPark (PNNT) Is Holding the Group Back\n\nPNNT Lags Index ETF Funds\n\nTPG Specialty Lending (TSLX)\n\nDividend Yield: 7.5%\n\nTPG Specialty Lending (TSLX) is a higher-quality BDC that I highlighted earlier this year, and that has gone on to beat the broader BDC funds since then in an erratic year for the industry.\n\nA quick refresher:\n\nTPG Specialty Lending is the direct credit investment platform of private equity outfit TPG. If a small business needs money to gobble up a complementary company, restructure itself or just fund growth, TPG Specialty Lending likely has a solution. The \u201ctypical\u201d portfolio company varies widely, with the company investing anywhere from $15 million to $350 million in companies with an enterprise value of between $50 million and $1 billion.\n\nIn short, TSLX doesn\u2019t shy away from much.\n\nThe result is an interesting portfolio mix. You get access to lesser-known businesses such as risk-management software provider Riskonnect, oil-and-gas E&P firm Mississippi Resources, and cloud treasury/finance leader Kyriba. But you\u2019re also plugged into investments in companies with more name recognition, such as smarthome-services provider Vivint, retailer Barneys New York and grocer Save A Lot.\n\nTSLX is dealing with shrinking net investment income this year, too, and it\u2019s no small drop. Its $57.8 million in NII through the first six months of its fiscal year is down 14% from this time last year. That said, the BDC is carrying a heftier heap of unrealized gains. As a result, its six-month net income of $1.32 per share is actually 23% higher year-over-year.\n\nTPG Specialty Lending continues to intelligently live within its means, too. TSLX has stuck with a base dividend rate of 39 cents per share for years. However, since 2017, it has paid out quarterly special dividends as additional profits allowed. Based on special dividends over the past 12 months, TSLX actually yields 8.6% \u2013 more than a percentage point higher than its headline yield.\n\nTPG Specialty Lending\u2019s (TSLX) Quality Keeps Winning Out\n\nTSLX Keeps Winning\n\nNewtek Business Services (NEWT)\n\nDividend Yield: 10.0%\n\nI highlighted the virtues of Newtek Business Services (NEWT) two years ago, and given what it has accomplished since then, it\u2019s worth a fresh look.\n\nNewtek is a direct business lender that caters to businesses of all sizes, and I really do mean all sizes. Its lines of credit start at just $10,000, and extend all the way up to $1.5 million.\n\nThe first thing that struck me when I reviewed it back in 2017 was, of all things, its website. It\u2019s glossy. It\u2019s consumer-facing. As I said at the time, it \u201clooks more like a commercial banking portal than a dry BDC.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Newtek doesn\u2019t just feel different \u2014 it is different.\u201d\n\nIndeed, if Newtek were just a direct business lender, it probably would be in the same leaky boat as many other BDCs. But NEWT isn\u2019t just that, and instead has positioned itself as something of a full-service depot, helping portfolio companies with mobile payment processing solutions, web design, even payroll and benefits.\n\nMany of its services are critical to small businesses \u2014 things they would seek out on their own anyway. Newtek, by offering these services itself, is proactively improving the chances its investments pay off.\n\nNewtek Business Services\u2019 (NEWT) Returns Aren\u2019t Like Other BDCs, Either\n\nNEWT Total Return Dividend Chart\n\nInvestors should know, however, that Newtek doesn\u2019t have a fixed dividend. While the overall trend is friendly, the BDC does have a variable payout. Yes, NEWT is dripping in dividends at the moment, but it\u2019s hard to rely on it for consistent retirement income.\n\nThe upside is that Newtek\u2019s adjusted net investment income (ANII) is growing like a weed, and that in turn is helping it to pay its rapidly expanding dividend. ANII for the first six months of 2019 are up 15% year-over-year, and the company expects its full-year payout will be 19% greater than 2018\u2019s.\n\nIn short, Newtek continues to be a bright spot in a difficult industry.\n\nBetter Than BDCs: This \u201cPerfect\u201d Portfolio Will Quadruple Your Retirement Income\n\nWhile all three of these picks have sky-high yields that are 3x to 4x greater than what most blue chips deliver\u2013a must-have for retirement\u2013they also share a troubling similarity:\n\nTheir exposure to small business.\n\nEven whispers of \u201cRecession\u201d tend to send shockwaves through this industry. Most companies are certain to feel the pinch of an eventual economic downturn, but these BDCs\u2019 portfolio companies are among the most vulnerable to that kind of catastrophe. So while these picks have the yields you need, they don\u2019t have the security.\n\nThe stocks in my \u201cPerfect Income Portfolio\u201d do.\n\nThe old retirement planning model is broken. Twenty years ago, you could hide out in \u201csafe\u201d blue-chip dividend stocks\u2013a few utilities, some consumer staples\u2013and be in decent shape for retirement.\n\nNot anymore. People live much longer than they used to. Nest eggs are being stretched paper thin. The yields on popular dividend stocks can\u2019t sustain your retirement. Bonds won\u2019t get the job, either.\n\nThe so-called \u201cexperts\u201d haven\u2019t changed their tune. These pied pipers keep pointing investors toward the likes of Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). That\u2019s fine\u2013if you have $2 million or so stashed away for a rainy day. But unless you\u2019re sitting on a massive pile of cash, it\u2019s mathematically impossible for you to retire rich, wealthy and financially free by depending on outdated blue-chip stocks.\n\nBut my \u201cPerfect Income Portfolio\u201d can deliver exactly what investors need: Substantial income checks that will be there this year, next year, and for literally decades down the road.\n\nSeveral of my readers have found that this portfolio has literally doubled, tripled, or in a few cases actually quadrupled their annual income.\n\nNo, this isn\u2019t a complicated options strategy that has a 50% shot of bankrupting you overnight. No, it\u2019s not cryptocurrency, or marijuana, or some other speculative nonsense.\n\nIt\u2019s good, old-fashioned buy-and-hold investing. You go into your brokerage account, click \u201cBuy\u201d on these under-the-radar, outside-the-box income plays. Then you let time and compounding do their thing until you\u2019re ready to collect a regular super-sized dividend check.\n\nGrowing Account Value Chart\n\nToo good to be true? Look at this strategy\u2019s past 10 years of returns, and you\u2019ll see why I call it the \u201cPerfect Income Portfolio\u201d:\n\nWhat really makes this group of stocks stand out is that it\u2019s so much more than high headline yield. This portfolio checks off a bundle of vital retirement boxes:\n\nIt gives you a safe, secure, and steady income of $10s of thousand per year in cash\u2014not just \u2018paper gains.\u2019\n\nIt pays out more than enough to live on from dividends without drawing down your savings or assets.\n\nYou avoid overly complex, high-risk investments that can wipe out decades of hard-earned money in a matter of weeks or months!\n\nYou\u2019re not involved in any risky options, spread-bets, or day-trading.\n\nIt\u2019s simple to set up and simple to manage. That way you\u2019re not glued to your screen all day. Go out. Enjoy life. Your check\u2019ll be in the mail.\n\nDon\u2019t lie awake anymore worrying about your yo-yo-ing net worth. Instead, let me teach you more about this incredible strategy, including its dominant track record. In fact, I\u2019ll even let you hear it from the mouths of other investors that have reaped market-smashing gains from my research service.\n\nDisclosure: Brett Owens and Michael Foster are contrarian income investors who look for undervalued stocks/funds across the U.S. markets.
