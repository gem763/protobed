Tamra teased her pal as she met her the next day, looking hungover and abashed at what had transpired. 'No alcohol, no touching! Wasted, making out at a bar!'\n\nSexual setback: Gina Kirschenheiter shocked her castmates on Tuesday's episode of The Real Housewives Of Orange County when she revealed sleeping with her ex-husband Matt\n\nAt first, Gina swore nothing happened, but in a confessional, she griped: 'News travels so fast around here. You can't even make out with your own damn husband without getting caught.'\n\nMatt Kirschenheiter, 35, reportedly cheated on Gina during their marriage, entered into a relationship with the woman after their separation, and recently broke into Gina's home.\n\nBut Gina still seemed desperate for her relationship to work, even though they were in the throes of a challenging divorce and she recognized how terrible he was for her.\n\nThe mother of three had just learned that their five-year-old, Sienna, had sensory processing issues and suffered from motor delays that would require therapy.\n\nParty drama: The 35-year-old reality star also erupted at Braunwyn Windham-Burke during a birthday party\n\nMotor delays: Gina in addition to dealing with her split from Matt was dealing with her five-year-old daughter Sienna suffering from motor delays\n\nSensory processing: The mother of three had just learned that Sienna had sensory processing issues and suffered from motor delays that would require therapy\n\nWord spreads: Gina was surprised about people knowing about her and Matt, saying: 'News travels so fast around here. You can't even make out with your own damn husband without getting caught'\n\n'That's part of what makes me feel like I should try to get back with Matt,' she told pals, wondering if maybe she'd missed something in her daughter's development.\n\n'Clearly things are slipping, because\u2026it's overwhelming, and I'm just not enough for everybody.'\n\nThe episode, entitled Spilling Tea and Throwing Shade, found the cast preparing for Vicki Gunvalson's 57th birthday party at the Tea House on Los Rios, in San Juan Capistrano, California.\n\nAs the Tres Amigas\u2014Tamra, Vicki and Shannon Beador, 55\u2014scouted out costumes at a vintage shop, Tamra filled everyone in on Gina's drunken hook-up, which followed her February DUI.\n\nVintage shop: Shannon Beador joined Tamra Judge and Vicki Gunvalson as they shopped for costumes for the birthday tea party\n\n'I told her, ''Don't drink'',' Tamra recalled. 'And my girlfriend's like, ''Oh, she's wasted''.'\n\n'The horrible thing is Gina's finally in a place where she's ready to move on,' Tamra noted in a confessional. 'And now, hearing this news, it's gonna set her back.'\n\nWhen Gina slunk in a little late, the women set upon her, asking what happened.\n\nSet back: Tamra recalled that she told Gina not to drink when she saw her ex Matt\n\n'Did you touch his weiner?' Tamra asked, literally pointing a finger at Gina.\n\n'Maybe a little,' Gina admitted, making Tamra squeal, 'I knew it!'\n\nShannon worried that Gina would be giving up her shot at a new, independent life.\n\nCalled out: Gina showed up late and was called out by Tamra about being seen with Matt\n\n'I think we could be good together,' Gina said of Matt. 'I just don't know if I'll be able to trust him.'\n\nTamra later tried to get Kelly Dodd, 44, to attend the party, but she would have none of it.\n\nVicki once famously suggested that Kelly did cocaine, and later helped spread a rumor that Kelly participated in sex trains, having sex with multiple men, one after another.\n\nNice try: Tamra later tried to get Kelly Dodd to attend the party, but she declined\n\n'I'm sorry, but I'm not celebrating her birthday,' Kelly snarked. 'The only celebration I'm doing for her is going to her funeral.'\n\nThat evening, Gina showed up to the party dressed as a Day-Glo Mad Hatter, and was horrified to see some of her castmates more casually dressed.\n\nAs Emily Simpson, 43, put it, she looked like 'a hot tea party stripper.'\n\nFuneral celebration: Kelly said that she would only celebrate Vicki's funeral\n\nParty stripper: Gina was dressed as the Mad Hatter, but Emily Simpson thought she looked like a 'hot tea party stripper'\n\nBraunwyn Windham-Burke immediately got on Gina's nerves, telling servers she was allergic to wine, tea and nuts, asking for 'milk alternatives' and requesting a glass for her sparking water.\n\nBraunwyn was used to making special requests, as she had to cook 'three or four different dinners most nights' to accommodate her seven kids' special dietary needs.\n\nGina was irritated with her, as always, saying: 'Braunwyn's a great, big pain in the ass, that's what it is.'\n\nHigh maintenance: Braunwyn made multiple demands that irked Gina\n\n'She just has pain-in-the-ass-itis. It's very common in Orange County. There's no known cure.'\n\nGina told Emily and Braunwyn that she had been seeing 'Dr. Hottie,' a man whom she met after he slid into her DMs, but she felt guilty because she'd had dinner with Matt the night before.\n\n'We ended up having, like, a really good time,' Gina let on before pulling her giant hat over her head and confessing: 'Plus, I might have slept with him.'\n\nDinner date: Gina also spilled that she had dinner with Matt and 'might have slept with him'\n\nSuddenly Shannon called her from the parking lot, and the women ran out to see the Tres Amigas ride up a horse-drawn carriage.\n\n'I like being Queen,' said Vicki, stepping from the carriage onto a red carpet that Tamra and Shannon spread out before her.\n\nVicki had ostensibly gone as 'Queen Victoria,' but her makeup\u2014and the cake sculpture embedded in her high, white wig\u2014more closely recalled Marie Antoinette.\n\nBirthday girl: Vicki was enjoying being the queen of her own birthday party\n\n'Queen Victoria was actually really austere,' Braunwyn noted privately. 'You are not Queen Victoria. You are Marie Antoinette. Get your history right.'\n\nAs they all sat down to tea, the topic of Kelly came up, with Tamra sharing that she'd heard Kelly was in a 'bar fight' over the weekend.\n\nIn her version, Kelly had been arguing with her boyfriend, Dr. Brian Reagan, and left the bar, returning to find a woman with her arm around him.\n\nBar fight: Tamra shared a story about Kelly getting in a 'bar fight' over the weekend\n\nShe grabbed her arm, and the woman later claimed that Kelly had 'fractured her hand.'\n\nBraunwyn demurred, saying the truth was that Kelly and Brian had fought, gone their separate ways, then reunited the next day.\n\n'I feel like I always need to defend Kelly in these situations, because these women take little tidbits of information and blow them up,' she said.\n\nRecord straight: Braunwyn demurred, saying the truth was that Kelly and Brian had fought, gone their separate ways, then reunited the next day\n\nTamra and Shannon went to the bathroom to call Kelly, who said she had 'strep throat' and couldn't come, confusing Tamra, as she'd earlier said she had to return dresses in L.A.\n\nGina then had to take a call from Wee Thrive director Tawnie and when she returned to the table, explained to the ladies that her daughter had a motor delay.\n\n'You do public school, right?' Braunwyn asked, thinking of her own struggles with her kids, across the spectrum, but wording it in a way that set Gina's teeth on edge.\n\nTable call: Gina had to take a call from Wee Thrive director Tawnie and when she returned to the table, explained to the ladies that her daughter had a motor delay\n\nWhen Braunwyn asked for a glass so she wouldn't have to 'drink out of a bottle,' Gina lost it.\n\n'God damn it, Braunwyn,' she blurted. 'You're kind of a snob, in like, not the funniest way to me.'\n\nBraunwyn told her she was 'mean,' but Gina no longer cared, saying 'you kind of sound like an a**hole, and I'm done with it.'\n\nPublic school: Braunwyn asked Gina if her child was in public school\n\nBraunwyn explained that her three older children went a public school, though Vicki quickly pointed out it was a charter school, and not the same thing, making Braunqyn cry.\n\n'If you didn't contribute money to that school, would your kids be able to go?' Vicki asked.\n\n'One hundred percent they would,' Braunwyn insisted. 'But it has nothing to do with how much you donate.'\n\nFun party: Vicki chimed in as the discussion turned to public school\n\n'I'm not gonna do the crying,' Gina affirmed.\n\nShe noted that if she won the lottery, she'd immediately send her kids to a 'bougie' private school, to which Braunwyn replied that her kids didn't go to private school.\n\n'I'm not talking about your kids,' Gina screamed. 'It's not about you, Braunwyn!'\n\nLottery winner: Gina said if she won the lottery she would send her kids to private school\n\n'Pinkies up,' Braunwyn replied, falling back on tea-party etiquette.\n\n'Pinkies up,' Gina retorted. 'Happy birthday, Queen Victoria.'\n\nAs Braunwyn fled to the bathroom, Gina explained that she thought the woman was saying that being poor was better when your kids had problems, which she called 'an asshole thing to say.'\n\nPinkies up: Vicki watched as the arguing escalated until the women fell back on tea-party etiquette\n\nBack at the table, Braunwyn apologized for offering unsolicited advice.\n\nGina apologized, too, saying that it had taken her a long time to open up to the group about personal matters, so she was extra-sensitive and easily set off by others.\n\n'Happy flippin' birthday to me,' Vicki moaned, as everyone pulled off their wigs.\n\nOpening up: Gina later apologized to Braunwyn for being extra-sensitive\n\nCake was served, and Tamra rubbed it all over Vicki's face, hoping to end the party on a positive note.\n\nAs the Tres Amigas headed home, Tamra spilled the news that Kelly said she'd rather go to Vicki's funeral than attend her birthday party, which upset the birthday girl.\n\n'Who talks that way about somebody?' Vicki asked, tearing up. 'She's not welcome at my funeral.'\n\nFuneral talk: Vicki was hurt by Kelly saying she would rather go to her funeral than birthday party\n\n'Somebody needs to teach her what's funny and what isn't,' Shannon agreed.\n\n'I've never heard anybody in my life talk the way she does,' Vicki sobbed. 'And it hurts. She called me a pig, she called Steve a piece of s***, she went on social media calling me ugly.'\n\nWhen Shannon pointed out that Vicki had said things about Kelly, too, Vicki exploded.\n\nFeelings hurt: Tamra listened as Vicki started ranting about Kelly\n\n'I have not gone and talked about her looks,' she insisted. 'I have not talked about her family, I have not talked about that she pushed her mother down the stairs, I have not talked about how she doesn't have a relationship with her one brother\u2026'\n\n'Well, now you are,' Shannon noted, saying she'd sit down with Kelly soon.\n\nTamra was not aware that Kelly had 'pushed her mother down the stairs,' something she'd been accused of doing and denied back in April.\n\nAwkward silence: Shannon, Tamra and Vicki rode together in awkward silence\n\n'You can take the girl out of the hood, but you can't take the hood out of the girl,' Tamra opined.\n\nThere was one lighthearted note during the evening's show.\n\nThe Real Housewives Of Orange County will return next week on Bravo.", "description": "Gina Kirschenheiter shocked her castmates on Tuesday's episode of The Real Housewives Of Orange County when she revealed sleeping with her ex-husband.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/06/20362736-0-image-a-102_1572417998862.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
