The move was a precaution to prevent electrical equipment from sparking wildfires as the West Coast experiences heavy winds.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nMeteorologist Hannah Chandler-Cooley of the National Weather Service said a strong weather system around the Great Basin was causing high winds in northern California\n\n\u201cNortherly winds first and foremost really dry out the area,\u201d she told the New York Times, adding that trees toppling on power lines is a possible outcome of the \u201cextreme\u201d weather.\n\nWinds could hit 20 to 30 miles per hour and gusts at 35 to 45 miles per hour or more.\n\nPG&E has already cut power for hundreds of thousands of customers and will intermittently continue to do so as the weather progresses. More than half of all California counties are expected to be affected.\n\nIn all, about 2.5 million people will be temporality without electricity.\n\nIn some areas, like Berkeley, stores ran out of generators and classes at the university were canceled. In Santa Rosa, authorities reported multiple traffic collisions at intersections without power. Officials in Santa Clara County declared a local state of emergency.\n\n\u201cA lot of things are happening \u2014 all converging at once,\u201d said Michael Jones, founder and senior energy consultant of California Energy Advisers, a solar energy firm in Los Angeles. \u201cYou have a very old grid, about 127 years old, which needs constant upgrading.\u201d\n\nStocks in this Article PCG PG & E CORP. $10.98 +0.08 (+0.73%)\n\nJones told FOX Business that whether \u201cone believes in climate change or not, the effects are showing up in California. We are seeing consistent wildfires that have caused a number of blackouts and, of course, this is putting more weight on the grid.\"\n\nWith power outages across the state, several agencies have called for common-sense safety practices, like treating downed streetlights as stop signs. Jones has an eye on the future: \u201cI see a need for people to go green,\u201d use solars panel and work to get off the grid.\n\n\u201cThere's no way around it anymore,\u201d he said. Aside from solar power, going green can include installing energy-efficient windows, \"heating and air conditioning, cool paint, water systems \u2014 everything you can put in a house so it produces more energy than it uses.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, those impacted by the outages can check in with PG&E for updates.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nPG&E was found responsible for dozens of wildfires in the past few years, including one in the town of Paradise last November that killed 86 people. Senior Vice President of Electric Operations, Michael Lewis, said in a press statement that \u201cthe safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our most important responsibility, which is why PG&E has decided to turn the power off to customers during this widespread, severe wind event.\n\n\"We understand the effects this event will have on our customers and appreciate the public's patience as we do what is necessary to keep our communities safe.\u201d\n\nThe company expects to start turning the power back on Thursday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "In some areas, like Berkeley, stores ran out of generators and batteries, and classes were canceled.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
