Photo: PBS\n\nBlue\u2019s Clues is back. Dora the Explorer is a movie. Kate McKinnon voices Ms. Frizzle on Netflix\u2019s The Magic School Bus. And now, Apple is rebooting the greatest show about notebooks. Apple TV+, alongside cornering the market on 19th century authors, is bringing back a beloved children\u2019s show, Ghostwriter. For those of you who didn\u2019t spend half an hour a week solving mysteries along with the characters, Ghostwriter is about a group of neighborhood kids from Brooklyn who solve crimes with the help of a ghost named Ghostwriter. Simple! Ghostwriter manipulates nearby text to form words and sentences, but can\u2019t be seen or hear anything. Sounds spooky, but unlike Are You Afraid of the Dark?\u2019s reboot, you\u2019ll walk away with new writing skills rather than recurring nightmares.\n\nIn the reinvented version, four kids are \u201cbrought together by a mysterious ghost in a neighborhood bookstore, and must team up to release fictional characters from works of literature,\u201d according a release from Apple. The original Ghostwriter was produced by the Children\u2019s Television Workshop, which has since become Sesame Workshop. Apple TV+ reached an agreement with the nonprofit educational organization behind, you guessed it, Sesame Street earlier this year. Ghostwriter is just one show in their upcoming slate of children\u2019s programming. Ghostwriter premieres with the app\u2019s launch on November 1, so keep an eye out for erudite ghosts rearranging your notes to say \u201cApple TV+ is only $4.99 a month.\u201d", "description": "Apple TV+ is reviving the \u201890s television show \u2018Ghostwriter\u2019 for its new slate of children\u2019s programming.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/10-ghostwriter.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
