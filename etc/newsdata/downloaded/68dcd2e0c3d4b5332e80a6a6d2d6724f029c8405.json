Meet the people ready to fly.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nFuture astronaut Lori Fraleigh, at the Virgin hotel in San Francisco, was gifted a Virgin Galactic trip to space by her husband. (Christie Hemm Klok for The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Lori Fraleigh unwrapped the present her husband had given her for her 38th birthday, she found a curious surprise: a model of a spaceship. It was cool, sure, but a toy would be better suited for her young children, then 5 and 1, not her.\n\nThen she noticed the ticket. It took Fraleigh, a Silicon Valley executive, a moment to realize what her husband had purchased for her: a trip to space with Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic. \u201cI went through a lot of crazy emotions, like, \u2018Did you really buy this?\u2019 \u201d she recalled of the moment in 2011. \u201c \u2018Do we still have enough money to remodel the kitchen?\u2019 \u201d\n\nToday, her children are 13 and 9. The kitchen remodel has long since been completed. But Fraleigh is still waiting for her trip to space.\n\nFor years, Branson has been pushing a quixotic vision for the future, where his spacecraft would ferry passengers off Earth as frequently as airplanes. But for all the talk about a new Space Age full of citizen astronauts, the journey has been fitful, and filled with setbacks, including the death of a test pilot in 2014 after a harrowing crash.\n\n[Virgin Galactic's quest for space]\n\nBut now, 15 years after Branson founded Virgin Galactic, space tourism could be tantalizingly close to becoming a reality. The company has flown to the edge of space twice and says its first paying customers could reach space next year. Another space venture, Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos almost 20 years ago, hopes to conduct its first test flight with people this year, though it hasn\u2019t announced prices or sold any tickets. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAnd NASA recently announced that it would allow private citizens to fly to the International Space Station on spacecraft built by SpaceX and Boeing.\n\nWhich means that Fraleigh may soon finally get her five minutes of weightlessness, a view that promises to be spectacular and a test to see if she has the right stuff.\n\nFraleigh has dreamed of being an astronaut since she was a kid and has solid space geek credentials, including having attended Space Camp as a teenager.\n\n[What\u2019s it really like to live in space? 50 astronauts share their stories]\n\nBut she didn\u2019t think she could become a NASA astronaut and instead became a tech executive in Silicon Valley, a career that meant her family could absorb Virgin Galactic\u2019s charge ($200,000 per ticket in 2011) without financial hardship. A mother who spends weekends ferrying her children to soccer, baseball and music lessons, she doesn\u2019t look like a thrill seeker. The most adventurous thing she\u2019s done? Driving a go-cart in college, and \u201cI\u2019ve been on some hikes up in Lake Tahoe that were on the strenuous side.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s preparing for a ride in Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo, a sleek spaceplane with a rocket motor strong enough to send two pilots and as many as six passengers more than 50 miles high, where the Federal Aviation Administration says the edge of space begins. The spaceship is tethered to the belly of a large, twin-fuselage airplane that carries it to an altitude of about 40,000 feet. Then SpaceShipTwo is released, fires its engine and rockets off through the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nVirgin Galactic founder Richard Branson takes off his shirt to put on a FATP T-shirt (Future Astronaut Training Program) that was given to him by commercial astronaut Mark \"Forger\" Stucky at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., where they donated the rocket engine from the VSS Unity. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nFor decades, people have dreamed of such adventures. After the Apollo missions, Pan Am started a waiting list for tickets to the moon that by 1971 stretched 90,000 names long. Famed CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite signed up, as did future president Ronald Reagan. Later, in the 1970s and early 1980s, NASA was so convinced that the space shuttle would, as the name implied, offer regular service to Earth orbit that a committee was formed to sort out the sticky problem of how to choose the first private citizens to fly.\n\nFor today\u2019s space companies, it\u2019s anyone willing \u2014 and wealthy enough \u2014 to pay the steep cost.\n\nNASA said it would cost $35,000 a night for stays on the ISS, and the price to get there is estimated to be $50 million. Virgin Galactic has said it may in the short term raise the price of its tickets, which today cost $250,000.\n\n\n\nAfter flying a teacher in space, NASA planned to next fly a journalist. In his application essay, Walter Cronkite, the veteran broadcaster, wrote about why it would be important to send an independent journalist to chronicle what going to space is like. (Pete Karici/Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas) (petekarici/Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas)\n\nDespite the high costs, Virgin Galactic expects high demand from the wealthy. While it completes the testing phase of the spacecraft this year, the company projects flying 66 paying customers in 2020, more than 700 in 2021 and nearly 1,000 the following year. By 2023, when it expects to fly 1,562 paying passengers on 270 flights, it plans to have nearly $600 million in annual revenue. Earlier this year, Virgin Galactic announced it would go public by merging with a New York investment firm, a move that Branson said would \u201copen space to more investors and in doing so, open space to thousands of new astronauts.\u201d\n\nAlready, 600 people have signed up for what Virgin Galactic describes as a transformative experience of seeing Earth from space, what astronauts call the \u201coverview effect.\u201d That\u2019s more people than have been to space since 1961, when Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space.\n\nSecond thoughts?\n\n\n\nFuture astronaut Craig Wichner, at the Virgin hotel in San Francisco, paid his deposit in 2008. (Christie Hemm Klok for The Washington Post)\n\nCraig Wichner, who runs Farmland LP, an organic farmland investment fund in San Francisco, has been waiting for the opportunity for more than a decade. In 2008, he plunked down several thousand dollars as a deposit to ride on Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo with a bunch of friends who thought it\u2019d make a great adventure.\n\n\u201cWho wants to do this with me?\u201d a pal said at the time.\n\n\u201cYep, I\u2019m there,\u201d Wichner responded.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the adventure that attracted Wichner; it was the opportunity to help push humanity out of the atmosphere, he said. Buying a ticket was like casting a vote for Branson\u2019s spacefaring vision of the future \u2014 \u201cmy way of actually supporting his mission, his dream and helping advance humanity.\u201d\n\nIn the years since, the dream has unfurled slowly as Virgin Galactic learned that building a spacecraft was not as easy as initially thought. But the repeated delays had an upside. They allowed Wichner to meet many of the other \u201cfuture astronauts\u201d who\u2019d signed up with Virgin Galactic, space enthusiasts from 60 countries who now form a sort of exclusive fraternity. They meet occasionally, bonding over the prospect of a wild adventure.\n\n\u201cIt was just this wonderful, eclectic mix of people from all around the world,\u201d Wichner said.\n\nNow, as the company gets closer to flying and his number may soon be called, there are other factors to consider. Weighing on Wichner is the realization that spaceflight is dangerous. In 2014, during a test flight, the spacecraft came apart, killing Michael Alsbury, one of the test pilots and a father of two.\n\nWichner\u2019s reaction to the crash was \u201ca general sadness at the cost.\u201d But he was also inspired by the company\u2019s perseverance, \u201cthe unwavering commitment to just keep moving forward,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, however, the opinions of his own children, ages 13 and 8, matter. They\u2019re old enough to understand the consequences of failure.\n\n\u201cSometimes they\u2019re excited about me going into space, and sometimes they\u2019re scared,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s not worth doing if they\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s first ordinary citizen astronauts\n\n\n\nIn the early days of the Space Shuttle, NASA believed that it would be flying all sorts of people to space. A memo from 1982 showed what sorts of people might be able to express what going to space is like. (Courtesy of NASA) (petekarici/NASA Archives)\n\nNASA\u2019s leaders were convinced that the space shuttle could turn ordinary citizens into astronauts and set about trying to decide which private citizens should go first.\n\n\u201cSpace flight belongs to the public; they pay for it,\u201d reads a NASA memo from 1982. \u201cTherefore NASA\u2019s objective has been to maintain the openness of the program and to invite the public to participate to the extent possible. Now a new opportunity has emerged. With the advent of the Shuttle, people need no longer participate vicariously but may participate directly.\u201d\n\nAt the time, NASA Administrator James Beggs \u201cwas being barraged by people wanting to fly,\u201d said Alan Ladwig, who ran what NASA called its \u201cspaceflight participant program.\u201d \u201cHe was getting all these VIPs and reporters calling him and saying they wanted to fly.\"\n\nThe singer John Denver was among those keen to go. He lobbied NASA for a ride, touting that he was an airplane pilot and an amateur astronomer who kept in shape by running four to five miles a day.\n\n\u201cIf given the opportunity, I would go tomorrow,\u201d he said at a Senate hearing about flying private citizens on the shuttle.\n\nIn 1984, NASA surveyed artists about the prospect of a writer or painter going to space and got this response from Maya Angelou, the award-winning poet, according to a Chicago Tribune article from the time:\n\n\u201cAs poets over the centuries concentrated on Grecian urns, nightingales, ravens and romantic love, I am certain that poets in the future will focus on the configuration of planets, stars, weightlessness and the discovery of our universe.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs NASA announced it would fly a journalist to space, thousands applied. The space agency broke down the finalists by region, creating a mix of reporters from across the country, but the program was canceled after the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. (Courtesy of NASA) (petekarici/NASA Archives)\n\nUltimately, NASA decided to take people who could communicate the experience to others. First a teacher, then a journalist. NASA leaders \u201cfelt astronauts weren\u2019t the greatest storytellers,\u201d Ladwig said. \u201cSome of which was true, some not so true. A lot of them were miffed that people criticized their communication ability.\u201d\n\nBut first came a pair of powerful politicians.\n\nJake Garn, a Republican senator from Utah who headed the appropriations subcommittee that oversaw NASA\u2019s budget, pushed to go, saying it was his obligation to \u201ckick the tires\u201d of NASA\u2019s newest spacecraft. Less than a year later, Bill Nelson, then a Democratic congressman representing the Florida Space Coast, hitched a ride. There were also many non-NASA astronauts known as payload specialists who worked on specific projects in space and often had a particular technical expertise.\n\nThe White House, though, was looking forward to the flight of another civilian, Christa McAuliffe, a teacher from New Hampshire, who had been selected out of 11,000 applicants to fly on space shuttle Challenger in 1986. And NASA was deep in the process of picking the next civilian to fly \u2014 a journalist \u2014 when on Jan. 28, 1986, the Challenger\u2019s booster exploded, killing McAuliffe and the other six astronauts on board. The shuttle would stay grounded for more than 2\u00bd years and never achieve the frequency of flight NASA leaders had initially envisioned, averaging fewer than five flights a year.\n\nNo journalist ever flew. And the dreams of opening the shuttle to the general public were deferred.\n\n\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger, which exploded during launch on Jan. 28, 1986.

(NASA/AP)\n\nPreparing for flight\n\nWhile NASA shied away from flying private citizens after the explosion, the private sector kept pursuing it. In 2004, a venture backed by Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, made history when it flew the first private vehicle to the edge of space to claim the $10 million Ansari X Prize.\n\nThe flights were heralded as a new Space Age, one where the private sector would end the government\u2019s monopoly on space. But while the SpaceShipOne flights were successful, they were also harrowing; in one, the navigation system went awry and the pilot had to fly blind; in another, the spacecraft spun like a top all the way to space.\n\nWorried that someone would die in his spacecraft, Allen sold the rights to the technology to Branson, who set off to build the bigger, more robust SpaceShipTwo. And after the X Prize, Congress took notice, growing concerned over what they saw as dangerously loose regulations governing the industry. Former congressman James Oberstar, of Minnesota, criticized the FAA as having a \u201ctombstone mentality \u2014 wait until someone dies, then regulate.\u201d\n\nThe industry pushed back, saying burdensome rules would stifle a growing industry just as it was getting started, and, backed by the FAA, was able to keep the regulations relatively lax. So today, space tourism, like bungee jumping or skydiving, is governed under an \u201cinformed consent\u201d standard: Passengers acknowledge they understand the considerable risks, and zoom, off they\u2019ll go to space. And to secure a launch license from the FAA, the companies have only to demonstrate how they will protect people and property on the ground in the event of a crash.\n\nLate last year, two pilots flew Branson\u2019s SpaceShipTwo to the edge of space. Though it did not go into orbit, it was the first launch of a spacecraft with humans from U.S. soil since the space shuttle was retired in 2011.\n\nThen, in February, Virgin Galactic repeated the feat, this time with a crew member, Beth Moses, whose job is to prepare Virgin\u2019s customers for their rides to space. For her, the trip was \u201cmind-blowing,\u201d as if \u201cthe sands of time of your life have stopped for a moment.\u201d\n\nNow that Virgin Galactic is getting closer to flying customers, Moses is starting to prepare them to make sure they get the most from the experience. \u201cThe one question I ask every one of our customers long before training is what do you most want to get out of your spaceflight?\u201d she said. Some \u201cwant to do somersaults,\u201d others want \u201ca Zen, private experience.\u201d Others are flying \u201cto honor someone. . . . It\u2019s an amazing variety.\u201d\n\nBut she knows some will have concerns. Part of her job is to allay them, so participants \u201carrive ready to savor your space experience,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are concerned about any aspect of the flight, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll walk through and just explain it.\u201d\n\n\n\nFuture astronaut Dee Chester, at the Virgin hotel in San Francisco, used an inheritance to buy her ticket. (Christie Hemm Klok for The Washington Post)\n\nDee Chester, a 62-year-old retired schoolteacher from Newport Beach, Calif., bought her ticket in 2017, when she came into her inheritance. She said she has no hesitation about going and can\u2019t wait for when her \u201clittle nose prints are on every window\u201d of the spacecraft. \u201cI want to do the Superman pose, and look at the Earth and see the very thin bands of the atmosphere. I just hope I\u2019m not crying and miss it all because it\u2019s a big wet blur.\u201d\n\nNow that his day of flying is getting closer, Wichner is getting excited, as well. But he still needs to have the frank conversation with his children, who remain wary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll happen naturally, and I think they\u2019ll be fine with me going,\u201d he said.\n\nUntil they are, he won\u2019t commit, leaving the future uncertain: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m actually going to go.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHow to dress for space: Explore five iconic spacesuits in 3-D\n\nMoonrise: Uncover the real origin story behind the United States\u2019 decision to go to the moon\n\nFollow The Post\u2019s coverage of space", "description": "After years of waiting, Virgin Galactic is close to flying tourists to the edge of space.", "authors": ["Christian Davenport", "Reporter Covering The Defense", "Space Industries", "October At Am", "Christian Davenport Covers The Defense", "Space Industries For The Washington Post'S Financial Desk.
