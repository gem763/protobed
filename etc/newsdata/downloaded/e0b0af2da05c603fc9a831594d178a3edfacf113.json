If we get that level then I expect we can do okay.\u201d\n\nChelsea will be boosted by the return of 18-year-old winger Callum Hudson-Odoi, who made a scoring return from a long-term Achilles injury in their midweek League Cup win over Grimsby Town but Olivier Giroud faces a late fitness test.\n\nCentre back Antonio Rudiger is still out with a groin injury but fellow defender Andreas Christensen is in contention after recovering from a knee injury he sustained against Liverpool.\n\nBrighton, 15th in the table, have never taken a point off Chelsea in the Premier League but Lampard said that statistic would not lull his team into complacency.\n\n\u201cWe must respect Brighton hugely because they\u2019re playing very well,\u201d he added. \u201cStats are stats. In fact, that would worry me more than an in-between stat. Each game has to be treated as a new game.\n\n\u201cSo we can\u2019t just because we haven\u2019t had a home win expect it will come because we\u2019re Chelsea and they\u2019re Brighton. No, we respect them and we\u2019ll try and get our win.\u201d", "description": "Chelsea manager Frank Lampard is confident that his team's improving performances can bring them a first home Premier League win of the season against Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434547628&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0ZK", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
