The Hoops\u2019 next fixture takes them to Rome, where a draw would be of great significance to Neil Lennon and his players.\u200b\n\nRangers, meanwhile, are second in Group G, two points behind Young Boys and ahead of Porto on goal difference. They are, in fact, a point worse off than at the same stage last year but this time they have two home games in the second half of their campaign, against Young Boys and Porto.\u200b\n\nThere are other variables to be taken into account but, so far, the Glasgow pair have bolstered Scotland\u2019s club competition coefficient with the potential to cut next year\u2019s qualifying process from four rounds to three. \u200b\n\n\u201cThe four qualifiers are a marathon and if you can take one away then great, but even three qualifiers is a big ask,\u201d Lennon said.\u200b\n\n\u201cWe want to get the coefficient up. At the minute though, all I\u2019m thinking about is trying to get through the group and then take it from there.\u200b\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that the Champions League is way beyond any Scottish club. In time, we will be there again and challenging and, hopefully, breaking the ceiling of the last 16 again.\u200b\n\n\u201cBoth teams are in the Europa League at the minute and performing very well. It\u2019s the competition we are in so we have to maximise what we have.\u201d\u200b\n\nCeltic\u2019s meeting with Lazio was foreshadowed by fears of trouble from the visitors\u2019 notorious Ultra support but the occasion turned out to be the celebration of football Lennon had anticipated, adding to his enjoyment of an absorbing contest won by fine goals from Ryan Christie and Christopher Jullien and secured by Fraser Forster\u2019s superlative saves from Marco Parolo and Dario Cataldi.\u200b", "description": "Like the outcome of Brexit, predictions about the possible fortunes of the Old Firm in Europe are fraught with hazard but, at the midway point of their Europa League group stage campaigns, both Celtic and Rangers are well placed to extend their participation beyond Christmas.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent", "Sam Dean", "Jamie Carragher", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000214039522-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLiZnSJs8x6dOfuqFtiWqEcNXlHzFQX0q9rbqpSNZfi0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
