In the daily tweetstorms, the president has come to resemble King Lear, flailing at his enemies among the duplicitous Democrats, perfidious Republicans, arrogant federal judges, the ineffable St. James Comey, the bogus Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d investigation and whatever else triggers him in the wee small hours of the morning.\n\nThe result: consistently mediocre approval numbers, with around 45 percent at the high end.\n\nMany on the right credit Trump\u2019s promiscuous tweeting with helping him speak directly to the public and over the heads of the nakedly partisan national media. But Twitter has long since outlived its usefulness; the media now pounces on every habitual exaggeration, misspelling, infelicitous phrase and politically incorrect retweet, reframing each through its current favored prisms of racism/white supremacy and apocalyptic climate change.\n\nAll this attention feeds Trump\u2019s enormous ego but wearies an electorate that would like to just enjoy the good economy while it lasts (part of the daily barrage is an \u201cimminent recession\u201d) and think about politics a year from now.\n\nBut the president won\u2019t let them. As a playboy businessman in Manhattan during the go-go Eighties, Trump had the media eating out of his hand. When the press turned on him after his inauguration, he continued to try to woo them to no avail. Biting the hand that provides them copy is proof of their independence.\n\nWorse is his demoralizing penchant for pulling the rug out from under his supporters with policy initiatives and personnel appointments that are announced and then almost immediately yanked back: tariffs on \u201cChristmas items\u201d from China, the deportation of sick \u201cmigrants,\u201d conservative congressman John Ratcliffe\u2019s short-lived float as director of national intelligence, ineffectual, court-blocked threats to end the so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d protection for illegal immigrants who arrived as children and to close the Mexican border, and to build the wall. Follow-through has never been Trump\u2019s strong suit.\n\nWorst of all are the appointments and policy prescriptions that no conservative could ever endorse: lawyer Christopher Wray as head of a tarnished FBI, now tracking border groups opposed to US immigration policy as \u201cextremist organizations\u201d; and his bruiting of \u201cred flag\u201d laws to preemptively disarm Americans without due process on suspicion of mental illness \u2014 including using home-espionage equipment such as Amazon Echo and Apple Watch to collect data on individuals. All of which makes Trump eminently beatable next year.\n\nThat\u2019s the bad news.\n\n\u2018The American people didn\u2019t elect him to be the star of a round-the-clock reality show\u2019\n\nThe good news is that the Democrats are hell-bent on nominating one of an eccentric collection of geriatric socialists (Sanders), gibbering lunatics (Biden), mendacious college professors (Warren), gay small-town mayors with no other apparent qualifications (Buttigieg) and, God help us, Mayor de Blasio.\n\nThe one candidate who could handily whip Trump next year, Tulsi Gabbard, was kicked out of the next round of debates presumably for her on-stage gutting of party fave Kamala Harris last month.\n\nTrump can turn all this around by shutting up and simply doing his job. The American people didn\u2019t elect him to be the star of a round-the-clock reality show. Nor did they designate him to be the boss of us, in the manner to which he\u2019s been accustomed to running the Trump Organization. They elected him to be a leader. As JFK used to say, \u201cNever complain, never explain.\u201d\n\nAll those red flags? They have nothing to do with Russia, mental illness nor even the big storm that just bypassed Mar-a-Lago. They\u2019re right there, in the White House mirror.\n\nMichael Walsh is an author, political commentator, and screenwriter.
