(Andy Hincenbergs/CBC)\n\nToday, Valerie Jackson, Square Canada's communications manager, confirmed to CBC News the issue isn't a tech problem after all.\n\n\"I want to clarify that Square is not experiencing a technical glitch. While I cannot speak with you about Monica's individual case, I can tell you that Square's Customer Success team spoke with Monica yesterday, and she now knows the reason,\" she wrote in an email to CBC News.\n\nThe U.S. has a financial and commercial embargo against Cuba, severely limiting dealings with Cuban interests. Mustelier is Canadian and says she has no idea why a U.S. embargo is affecting her Canadian business.\n\n\"For the U.S. sanctions against Cuba to affect us so directly is a shock, because I know Canada and Cuba have good relations,\" she says.\n\nMoney missing since August\n\nMustelier had been using Square technology for the past three years without incident.\n\nThen, in late August, thousands of dollars Square Canada was supposed to transfer into her bank account never made it.\n\nEver since, Square Canada had been working with Mustelier to find out what went wrong.\n\n\"I don't know why they would be using a third party in the States to process Canadian funds,\" Mustelier says about Square Canada's use of the U.S. bank.\n\n\"If I knew Square's policy, I probably wouldn't have used them in the first place,\" she adds.\n\nShe says Square Canada has told her, the company is still working on refunding her the $14,000.\n\nIn the meantime, Mustelier is now looking for a payment system that uses Canadian banks only, to process transactions.\n\nCBC News has contacted Square Canada for further comment on its plans.", "description": "The owners of a Toronto coffee stand say Square Canada has told them they can no longer use the popular payment technology because of concerns the coffee stand is selling beverages made from Cuban coffee beans.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Cbc Toronto", "John Lancaster Is A Senior Reporter With Cbc News Focusing On Investigative", "Enterprise Journalism.
