Storms and wind are also likely to have exchanged hot water in shallow areas with cooler water from deeper areas, officials said.\n\nCoral paling, which is the precursor to bleaching, has affected some corals, and the island is still under a bleaching warning, which is anticipated to remain for up to four weeks, Hoot said.\n\n\"If we were expected to stay at the warning level for a long time, I would be more concerned about the impacts of the ongoing thermal stress,\" Hoot said. \"But since the warning status should end soon and we're not expected to reach alert level one or alert level two, we are hopefully going to avoid severe bleaching this year.\"\n\nWhile severe bleaching is no longer expected, the reefs \"are still at risk from local stressors - over-fishing, pollution, physical damage from groundings, and human users,\" Hoot said.", "description": "Measurements indicated US territory would likely experience significant coral bleaching, a precursor to coral death.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/aa686cbda696478088242754f26321df_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
