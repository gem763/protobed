In addition to any sentence imposed by the court, people must pay back all the money they falsely obtained.\n\n'We have zero tolerance of anyone fraudulently claiming benefits and will take swift action to investigate, supporting our partners and prosecutors to bring them to justice.'", "description": "Nasreen Akhtar from Oldham said she was 'too ill to work', had 'poor mobility' and was a single parent.
