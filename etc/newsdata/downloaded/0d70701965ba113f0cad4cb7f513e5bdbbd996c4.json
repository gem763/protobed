Was it news to you today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never surprised,\u201d Pompeo shot back, prompting laughter from the room. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean that on just this issue. And I think Secretary Mnuchin would say the same thing.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked whether he was \"blindsided\" by John Bolton\u2019s ouster.\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019m never surprised\" https://t.co/L1lsbiHxsr pic.twitter.com/RyCl4KV3TL \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 10, 2019\n\nPompeo made it clear he wasn\u2019t joking, attempting to assure reporters he was well aware of Bolton\u2019s impending departure amid the remarkably high turnover rate within the Cabinet. Many of the staffing shakeups have occurred without apparent warning.\n\n\u201cWe work very closely with the president of the United States,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI think we have a pretty good understanding of how he\u2019s thinking about things, I think you\u2019d agree, Steven, at nearly all times. Our mission is not to talk about these inner workings and the palace intrigue that I know you are so curious about, but rather to talk about the things that matter to American foreign policy.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Trump announced Bolton\u2019s exit in a pair of tweets, noting that he had requested that Bolton step down.\n\n\u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore ... I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d", "description": "The secretary of state attempted to assure reporters he wasn't blindsided by the former national security adviser's abrupt firing.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d782c02240000c92b77cb1b.jpeg?cache=cox2kpqs5v&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
