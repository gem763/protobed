President Donald Trump moved U.S. troops aside over the weekend to allow for the invasion, and said Turkey would take charge of the IS prisoners, including those Western countries refuse to repatriate out of security concerns. The U.S. is also planning to relocate dozens of the most feared IS prisoners to detention facilities in neighboring Iraq, according to Iraqi officials.\n\nThe al-Hol camp is some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Turkish border, outside the \"safe zone\" Turkey plans to set up in northern Syria. But as the fighting worsens, there is a heightened risk that large numbers of detainees could escape. Al-Baghdadi himself was a former prisoner in Iraq, and jail breaks played a major role in the growth of IS after U.S. and Iraqi forces had nearly eliminated an earlier incarnation of the group a decade ago.\n\nDozens of camp residents attacked an exit gate in an apparent escape attempt before Kurdish security forces brought the situation under control, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said Friday. Video from a closed-circuit camera showed security forces chasing women in black robes through the center of the camp.\n\n\"With increased SDF vulnerability, SDF control of al-Hol is likely to weaken and they will not coordinate with Turkey,\" said Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. She said the SDF is already struggling to maintain order and that IS is likely to exploit the chaos unleashed by the Turkish invasion to mobilize prisoners.\n\n___\n\nKNIVES OUT\n\nThe Islamic State group lost its last foothold of territory in March, when the Syrian Kurdish forces captured the eastern village of Baghouz with U.S. support.\n\nBut inside the overcrowded and squalid al-Hol camp, the group's violent ideology is alive and well, and a new generation is being indoctrinated. The International Committee of the Red Cross says the more than 40,000 children in the camp \"have experienced more violence, trauma and displacement in their short life than any of us can imagine.\"\n\nFemale IS members have turned one of their tents into a court administering the group's harsh interpretation of Islamic law. Last month, they found a 16-year-old girl guilty of apostasy. After the verdict was announced, women pulled knives from their all-enveloping black robes and stabbed her repeatedly. Kurdish guards evacuated her to a clinic where she later died, according to Abdul-Qader al-Ofeidly, commander of the Kurdish police force known as Asayish, which guards the camps. It was not clear what her nationality was.\n\nHe said she was one of several people attacked or killed by fellow detainees. A Syrian man with an amputated leg who moved about on crutches was also stabbed to death by female detainees after being accused of apostasy, the commander said.\n\nAl-Hol is home to some 71,400 people, mostly wives, widows and children of IS fighters. They were swept up in the long and grueling military campaign that eventually dismantled the extremists' self-styled caliphate, which at its height in 2014 stretched across a third of Syria and Iraq. The SDF was a key U.S. ally in that effort and lost more than 11,000 fighters in battles with the extremists.", "description": "In the sprawling al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria, Islamic State wives and widows have set up special courts, stabbed to death at least two people accused of apostasy and wielded knives and pistols in clashes with their Kurdish guards.
