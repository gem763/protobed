His owner agreed to this,\u201d the police posted on their Instagram page.\n\n\u201cWhen the owner was released shortly after, the bird accompanied him.\n\n\u201cThe bird hasn\u2019t been questioned and is as far as we know not guilty of any charges,\u201d the police added.\n\nBut people weren\u2019t impressed with the cops who gave the bird water and bread to nibble on while it was in the holding cells.\n\n\u201cNext time give it fruit and seeds, NOT BREAD! Please,\u201d Chilinista Marlene protested.\n\n\u201cPlease just no bread? It\u2019s really bad for birds,\u201d another Instagram user said.\n\nThe Irish Independent reported that during the confinement, cops \u201cwere shocked to find out that we aren\u2019t in possession of a bird cell or cage\u201d.\n\n\u201cOfficers said that although the station didn\u2019t have a cage for the bird, it was being \u2018well cared for\u2019,\u201d the publication stated.\n\nSources: Instagram, Irish Independent", "description": "Jailbird took on a new meaning when Dutch police arrested the feathered creature in connection with a robbery last week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9438/8e171c4140fb4a6ab897fc5e090dc582.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
