The president has lambasted the Biden family for Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine in recent weeks.\n\nTrump\u2019s request for foreign assistance to investigate a political rival is at the heart of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, following a whistleblower complaint that detailed concerns over Trump pressing the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family during a phone call in July.\n\nAlthough most Republicans have remained silent about Trump\u2019s public statements Thursday, retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) told CNN that Trump\u2019s China comments were \u201cterrible\u201d and was \u201csomething a president of the United States shouldn\u2019t be doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is an adversary,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tight and complex trade negotiation with China now, and so you\u2019re potentially giving them something to hold over your head.\u201d\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) also criticized Trump in a statement Thursday to the Omaha World-Herald.\n\n\u201cHold up: Americans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cIf the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8f/e2/f87c376c43ed93771622d12c0faa/19104-mitt-romney-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
