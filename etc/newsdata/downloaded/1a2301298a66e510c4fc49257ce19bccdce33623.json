It comes as analysts at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and UBS all slashed profit expectations across the stock market going into 2020.\n\n\u201cTotally absurd! Analysts are taking a knife to their 2020 profit estimates just when the S&P500 is about to set a new record! Analysts just cut S&P 500 estimates by the most since January\u201d \u2013 Holger Zschaepitz, Welt.\n\nIt\u2019s an eerier parallel to October 2018 when a raft of analyst downgrades triggered a 16% slide in the Dow Jones. Conditions are similar to last year with the US stock market hovering just shy of record highs. As Zschaepitz explained:\n\n\u201cLast year 2019 earnings estimates started rolling right before the market sell-off.\u201d\n\nDow futures flat on Tuesday\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) futures were flat at 6 am ET as traders await earnings reports from McDonald\u2019s and Procter & Gamble.\n\nS&P 500 futures and Nasdaq Composite futures were also traded flat.\n\nWall Street nervous about 2020 stock market earnings\n\nEarnings season thus far has surprised to the upside with 81% of companies beating (admittedly damp) expectations. But Wall Street remain cautious about growth going into 2020. Analysts revised total S&P 500 profit expectations down 0.5% for 2020, the biggest shift in nine months.\n\nDataTrek Research is among the most glum, predicting almost zero growth in the next twelve months. Co-founder Nick Colas cites high wages and slow sales growth for the miserable outlook. Even as Q3 earnings beat expectations, analysts continue to revise this quarter\u2019s estimates down.\n\n\u201cAnalysts are cutting Q3 earnings expectations even as companies report above consensus results. At the start of Oct the consensus had a 4.1% earnings drop for S&P 500 earnings. That fell to 4.6% the next week & is now worse at -4.7% even with a solid week of \u2018beats\u2019.\u201d DataTrek Research.\n\nBut isn\u2019t the Dow near all-time highs?\n\nThe negative sentiment seems at odds with the Dow and S&P 500\u2019s lofty heights. As CCN reported, the stock market is within inches of all-time highs and expected to climb higher. How did this dichotomy emerge?\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, it\u2019s all down to the Fed. Analyst Mike Wilson said the warning signs from corporate earnings are being hidden by the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to lower rates.\n\n\u201cOnce the market gets past the initial relief [of Fed injections] it will have to contend with the deteriorating fundamentals.\u201d\n\nEarnings reports from Harley Davidson, McDonald\u2019s, Hasbro, Procter & Gamble, and SNAP later today should give us another insight into the market\u2019s fundamental health.", "description": "Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) futures point to a nervous stock market open on Tuesday as Wall Street slashes profit expectations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Stock-trader-screen-ntb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
