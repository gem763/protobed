He was promptly suspended for that bit of rebellion and the chief of police is now requiring him to be retrained.\n\n\"Our county is one of the most diverse counties in the nation and no one should have the perception that FCPD is acting as a civil immigration agent for ICE,\u201d Chief Edwin Roessler said in a statement. \u201cThis matter damages our reputation and the longstanding policy that I have stated many times that our officers shall not act as immigration agents.\"\n\nThomas Homan, former ICE acting director, tried to put his frustration with the chief into words during a \"Fox & Friends\" interview Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It's totally disgusting,\" Homan said.\n\nHoman said he had the read the story out of Fairfax three or four times to make sure he was seeing things straight. He \"couldn't believe\" the decision made by the chief, who he preferred to call a politician.\n\n\"He\u2019s a politician,\" Homan said. \"He stopped being a cop with that decision.\"\n\nICE, Homan added, \"is not the bad guy.\" They're the ones keeping Fairfax and other counties safe by \"taking criminal aliens off the streets.\"\n\n\"This world\u2019s upside down,\" Homan regretted. \"When those who illegally enter our country in violation of law - all of a sudden they\u2019re the victims. And the ones who enforce law are the bad guys.\"\n\n\"If I was ICE director today, I'd hire that officer,\" Homan said of the now-suspended Fairfax cop.", "description": ".10/03/2019 3:17:58AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/80/f4f66436-9a34-4294-82bf-1e73d54eb74f.jpg"}
