If you are not 100 per cent sure its not completely natural, don't do it,' she said.\n\nDozens of other Australians have posted photos of their own or their children's painful burns, some of which were still there as scars.\n\nNumerous other Australians on Tuesday posted photos of their own or their children's painful burns, some of which were still there as scars\n\nBefore and after photos of a girl who got a black henna tattoo on her back only for it to give her horrendous burns\n\nTom Birkin said he was burned after getting a Mike Tyson-style black henna tattoo on his face and it took eight months to heal.\n\n'Don\u2019t get them done, it was a big mistake and I was in hospital seven days,' he said.\n\nDr Ryan Harvey from House Call Doctors said patients suffered extreme allergic reactions that caused chemical burns to the skin.\n\n'Unlike here in Australia, there may not be any regulation of what goes into the dye, and children in particular can have extreme reactions that can cause blistering, open sores and a chemical burn,' he told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'While many parents think getting a temporary henna tattoo is harmless holiday fun, it can lead to permanent scarring.'\n\nPPD is banned for use on skin in Australia, but other victims even said they were hurt by tattoos at festivals and even a community fair held at a primary school.\n\nDr Harvey said the first thing to do was to immediately running the area under cool water to treat the chemical burn.\n\n'If it is an allergic reaction, the patient may need antihistamine, a topical steroid cream or a steroid tablet to treat the burn,' he said.\n\n'It depends on the extent of the burn but if it covers a large percentage of the body, particularly in children, they may need to be observed in hospital so they don't go into shock.\n\nDoctors said there may not be any regulation of what goes into the dye, and children in particular can have extreme reactions that can cause blistering, open sores and a chemical burn\n\nDoctors said the first thing to do was to immediately running the area under cool water to treat the chemical burn\n\n'Keep up your fluid intake and stay hydrated because all the fluid in your body will rush to the burn site.'\n\nDr Harvey said natural henna never contains PPD, it is entirely made of plant-based ingredients, including eucalyptus.\n\n'The clear difference is real henna is never black, but rather an orange colour with a red or brown tint to it,' he said.\n\n'Any very dark temporary tattoo should be treated with caution. Black henna tattoos are readily available in many countries, therefore it is important to be extra vigilant as many tattoo places will not inform tourists that black henna is being used.'", "description": "Australian holidaymakers to Bali and other Asian destinations often get temporary tattoos on their trip, even for children as young as five, and many suffer allergic reactions that cause chemical burns.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/09/07/15807376-0-image-a-43_1562654117365.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
