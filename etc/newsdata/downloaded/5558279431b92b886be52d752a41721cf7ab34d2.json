The flag went up, then down, and three Georgia points were rubbed off the scoreboard.\n\nMinutes later, a moment of typical Fiji improvisation caught Georgia cold as Radradra did well to stop flyhalf Ben Volavola\u2019s grubber kick going out. He showed good hands to feed the ball quickly and accurately inside to the surging Nayacalevu, who sprinted clear.\n\nVolavola clipped over the first of his five conversions and was not needed for penalty goals, given the rampant mood Fiji was in after the sheer disappointment of losing its second group game to Uruguay in one of the tournament\u2019s big upsets.\n\nThis was far more like the Fiji which led Australia at halftime, before losing that one, too.\n\nNayacalevu should have had a second try in the first half after a superb passing move cut Georgia open, but he fumbled midfield partner Levani Botia\u2019s pass inside and admonished himself after tumbling face-first into the wet turf.\n\nGeorgia then launched a brilliant attack from deep in its own half, carving Fiji open at speed with some great handling.\n\nAfter left wing Alexander Todua and scrumhalf Vasil Lobzhanidze were held up, lock Konstantine Mikautadze emerged through a scrum but knocked on with the try-line in sight.\n\nTodua had been high tackled near the neck area, however, and Matiashvil kicked the penalty goal to make it 7-3.\n\nThe sides traded tries early in the second half, and then it was time for the crowd to sit back and enjoy 30 minutes of the Fiji show.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Fiji boosted its flagging Rugby World Cup campaign with seven tries and scintillating attacking rugby in a 45-10 win against Georgia on Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/japan_rugby_wcup_georgia_fiji_35637_c0-110-2631-1644_s1770x1032.jpg?b6c946683a07ca15f9475f4e38d4490281a2ed7a"}
