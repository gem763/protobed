Bond prices rose, pulling down the yield on the 10-year Treasury to 1.69% from 1.73% late Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. congressional inquiry into President Trump is throwing more volatility into an already sensitive market, particularly on trade issues. Traders also found no comfort in the Commerce Department's latest economic snapshot, which showed the U.S. economy grew at a modest 2% in the second quarter, a sharply lower pace than the 3%-plus growth rates seen over the past year.\n\n\"We're giving back, clearly, some of yesterday's gains,\" said Jeramey Lynch, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \"It's just the uncertainty.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 index fell 7.25 points, or 0.2%, to 2,977.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 79.59 points, or 0.3%, to 26,891.12. The Nasdaq dropped 46.72 points, or 0.6%, to 8,030.66.\n\nSmaller company stocks bore the brunt of the selling, sending the Russell 2000 down 17.33 points, or 1.1%, to 1,533.33.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq are each on track for their second straight weekly loss as volatile trading brought on by anxiety over trade issues takes its toll. The late September slide has been cutting into quarterly gains for the S&P 500 and all but erased the Nasdaq's third-quarter gain.\n\nStocks got off to a mostly lower start Thursday ahead of a televised congressional hearing in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The markets fluctuated the rest of the morning, but remained lower through much of the afternoon.\n\nWhile many analysts say the congressional probe isn't likely to affect the market significantly, it does add a degree of uncertainty and could complicate the White House's efforts to resolve trade disputes with China and other nations.\n\nChinese importers have set deals to buy American soybeans and pork as the governments make conciliatory gestures ahead of trade talks and Trump has suggested a trade deal could happen soon. Nonetheless, investors remain cautious ahead of the next round of trade talks between Washington and Beijing next month.\n\nSeparately, Japan and the U.S. signed a deal covering agricultural, industrial and digital trade, but it kept auto tariffs unchanged.\n\nCommunication services stocks fell broadly. Facebook slid 1.5% amid concerns that the company could find itself the target of another antitrust investigation.\n\nHealth insurers were among the biggest losers. UnitedHealth Group dropped 3% and Cigna slid 3.5%.\n\nEnergy stocks also declined. Chevron lost 2.7%.\n\nTechnology stocks rebounded after an early slide. The sector has been volatile all week amid investor concerns about the U.S.-China trade war and upcoming negotiations in October. Adobe rose 2.3%.\n\nHigh-dividend, lower-risk sectors fared better as investors sought safety. Procter & Gamble rose 1.1%, Kimco Realty added 2.4% and Edison International gained 1.6%.\n\nOutside of trade and politics, investors are getting ready for the close of the third quarter and more corporate earnings reports.\n\n\"What I'm looking forward to is earnings,\" Lynch said. \"Earnings are going to give us a look at how the third quarter was, particularly with the consumer.\"\n\nTraders got to review a mixed batch of quarterly company report cards Thursday.\n\nCarnival sank 8.6%, the biggest loser in the S&P 500, after the cruise line operator cut its 2019 profit forecast because of a spike in fuel costs. Crude oil prices have risen more than 23% this year on mix of high supplies and tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Other cruise operators also declined. Norwegian Cruise Line slid 3.8% and Royal Caribbean Cruises skidded 2.5%.\n\nConagra Brands climbed 3.7% after the food maker reported a surprisingly good first quarter profit. The company cited a solid sales increase in frozen foods and a benefit from last year's purchase of Pinnacle Foods.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Stocks ended modestly lower and bond prices rose on Wall Street Thursday as investors turned cautious, shifting money into lower-risk holdings.
