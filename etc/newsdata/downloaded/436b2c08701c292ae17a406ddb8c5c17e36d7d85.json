Much better than annoying Bruno #StrictlyComeDancing.\"\n\nOthers, though, seemed happy to express their love of Alfonso.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOne gushed: \"Absolutely love @alfonso_ribeiro, wish he was on strictly come dancing permanently.\"\n\nA second reiterated themselves: \"Said this last year, but I'll say it again: can we please keep Alfonso? #Strictly.\"\n\nThe star himself took to Twitter after tonight's results show was done and dusted to thank his fellow judges for their warm welcome.\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\nAlfonso wrote: \"Thank you @bbcstrictly for having me again this year.
