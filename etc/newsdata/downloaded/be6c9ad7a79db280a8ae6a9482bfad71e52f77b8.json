When the teams walk out for the Group C qualifier in Hamburg, it will be the fourth time the fierce rivals have faced each other in 11 months. Not that neutrals should be complaining. There have been 12 goals in the two Nations League matches and one Euro 2020 qualifier that have been played since \u2013 and some scintillating football. Nico Schulz\u2019s 90th-minute strike for Germany sealed a 3-2 victory in a pulsating qualifier at the Johan Cruyff Arena in March that left the Dutch on three points from two matches and facing a tricky game of catch-up to ensure automatic qualification. Northern Ireland\u2019s flawless start has powered them to the top of Group C on 12 points and piled pressure on Ronald Koeman\u2019s side, who will have to go on the attack at the Volksparkstadion. Expect another entertaining open game from two vibrant young sides. Gregg Bakowski\n\n\u2022 Germany v Netherlands, 7.45pm (all times BST), Friday\n\nTyrone Mings targets St Mary\u2019s as \u2018fitting\u2019 venue for England debut Read more\n\n2) Finland close in on their finest hour\n\nFootball has rarely been able to dent ice hockey\u2019s primacy in Finland but Markku Kanerva\u2019s team are on the verge of changing that. Over the next week they face two of the most important games in their history and, if at least one of Greece and Italy can be seen off in Tampere, a place at Euro 2020 should be within touching distance. They sit second in Group J, three points clear of Armenia and five in front of Greece and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a golden opportunity for a country that has only once come close to reaching a major tournament, when they fell just short of Euro 2008. Finland are formidable at home, they have not conceded in their last eight games, and in Norwich City\u2019s Teemu Pukki they have one of Europe\u2019s hottest centre-forwards. They may fancy their chances of toppling the injury-hit Italians, who will miss Lorenzo Insigne and Giorgio Chiellini and could be caught at the top when they meet on Sunday if all goes to plan. And if it unravels spectacularly? Finland would have the fallback of entering the play-offs, in that case, having been one of the winners in Nations League C. The opportunity that lies ahead could hardly be greater.

Ianis Hagi, son of the legendary Gheorghe, was the star , earning a move to Genk, although Ajax were also linked to the playmaker. He is joined in Cosmin Contra\u2019s squad to face Spain and Malta by six teammates from that under-21 squad, who became known for their attacking football as they defeated England and Croatia, and they will be given the chance to prove themselves at full international level against Spain in Bucharest. Whether Hagi can follow in his famous father\u2019s footsteps is unknown but he can be as influential for this generation and their first test could be telling, not that they will be afraid.

Vladimir Petkovic\u2019s side are similarly unbeaten but have played only two games, a win over Georgia and a hugely deflating 3-3 draw with Denmark in which they let a three-goal lead slip in the final six minutes. This means Mick McCarthy\u2019s side can open up a nine-point advantage over the only other realistic contenders for automatic qualification. McCarthy\u2019s preparations have not been entirely smooth, however, with James McCarthy, Kieren Westwood, Matt Doherty and Sean Maguire withdrawing through injury.

The son of the former international Carlos Mac Allister \u2013 whose unusual name originates from his family roots in Fife, Scotland \u2013 signed for Brighton last year, but work permit issues led to him being loaned to Boca Juniors this season. The 20-year-old plays alongside his older brother, Kevin Mac Allister, and scored this worldie winner in the Copa Libertadores on his first start for the club. Alexis\u2019 international call-up is good news for Brighton \u2013 the diminutive central midfielder could secure a British work permit next season if he continues to be involved with Argentina. It will be interesting to see if he makes his debut on Friday against Chile, who are missing their own Alexis, with S\u00e1nchez still in Italy after completing his loan move to Inter.

Clarke needs his squad to gel quickly, and said at his unveiling that his players need to be \u201c100% committed\u201d. In that context, Oli McBurnie\u2019s gaffe this week was particularly unfortunate, with the Sheffield United striker caught on camera sounding less than thrilled at the prospect of an international break. It was a snippet taken from a light-hearted exchange and McBurnie has dealt with it maturely, addressing his teammates in private. Outside of his Twitter mentions, all is forgiven. Now would be a good time for the Yorkshireman to do his talking on the pitch and find a first international goal.

With just three players aged over 23 permitted at Tokyo 2020, the head coach, Hajime Moriyasu, has opted for a young squad for the friendly against Paraguay, dropping Shinji Kagawa and Shinji Okazaki, both of whom this summer signed for clubs in the Spanish second tier. While Kagawa has impressed for Real Zaragoza, scoring against Ponferradina, Okazaki left M\u00e1laga on Tuesday after 34 days, without making an appearance. Japan\u2019s investment in youth means much is expected of Takefusa Kubo, who impressed in pre-season at Real Madrid and has joined Mallorca on loan. Without Kagawa, the 18-year-old is, perhaps unfairly, the headline name in this burgeoning team.

Twenty of the players called up to face Andorra and Moldova are under the age of 25, including hot prospects Abdulkadir Omur of Trabzonspor and Besiktas striker Guven Yalcin. Despite this new focus, Gunes knows the importance of experience and the most capped player in the squad, captain Emre Belozoglu, will earn his 100th a few days shy of his 39th birthday. He is required to influence those flair players alongside him to give Turkey momentum from two supposedly simple qualifiers. Even if they fail to qualify this time around, there is greater hope for the Turkish national team than there has been for a while.

They are Europe\u2019s youngest international team and, these days, a deadly serious one; anyone expecting an England walkover should think again but it is a shame they travel without their two biggest threats. Milot Rashica and Arber Zeneli are two of the most exciting wingers around but both are injured. Their absence dilutes a realistic chance of reaching Euro 2020 and Benjamin Kololli and Hekuran Kryeziu will miss out too. But Kosovo have other threats, such as the in-form Fenerbahce striker Vedat Muriqi and Swansea\u2019s Bersant Celina, so if they can emerge from Saturday\u2019s home tie with the Czech Republic unscathed then perhaps a shock in Southampton will be on. NA\n\nKosovo v Czech Republic, 2pm, Saturday\n\n10) Chad seek success after four-year sabbatical\n\nHow many matches do you think Chad\u2019s senior team have contested since their last tilt at World Cup qualifying, which ended with a 4-0 defeat to Egypt in November 2015? One, is the answer, and that fixture has since been expunged from the records. They have not taken to the field since losing to Tanzania the following March, after which they withdrew from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying competition on financial grounds, and were banned from the 2019 edition as a result. A squad of players based in France, Belgium, Niger, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Portugal, Indonesia and the local league will have had some catching up to do before facing Sudan in Thursday\u2019s first-round, first leg qualifier for Qatar 2022 in N\u2019Djamena. Thehe Frenchman Emmanuel Tr\u00e9goat has returned as coach in the hope of leading them into a new era. Chad is far from the only country that has had sustained issues putting a football team out but it goes to show that international football is not something anyone should take for granted.
