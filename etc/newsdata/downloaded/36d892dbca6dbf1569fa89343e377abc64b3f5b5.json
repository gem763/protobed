(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nGood news, renters.\n\nA new report from Zoopla suggests that the affordability of rent is improving, mostly because more people are making the move to home ownership.\n\nWhile in 2016 a typical single earner spent 33.3% of their earnings on rent, now they spend 31.8%.\n\nNo, that\u2019s not a massive drop, but let\u2019s just take this as a positive. We really need a win.\n\nOf course, some areas are more affordable than others.\n\nThe Zoopla report found that Hull is the most affordable place to rent, with the average single earner dedicating 19% of their salary to rent.\n\nNext up in the affordability stakes is Bradford, where tenants spend an average of 19.5% of their pay on rent, followed by Stoke, where on average 20.6% of a person\u2019s salary goes on rent.\n\nBear in mind that this ranking is based on affordability \u2013 meaning it\u2019s worked out on the area\u2019s average salary as well as the average rent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while Hull is the most affordable, it\u2019s Middlesborough that\u2019s actually the cheapest place to rent a home. The average price of rent in Middlesborough is \u00a3467 a month, while in Hull it\u2019s \u00a3469 (hope you can afford that extra \u00a32), and in Bradford it\u2019s \u00a3486.\n\nNo prizes for guessing the least affordable place to rent in the UK.\n\nThat\u2019s London, obviously, with the average single person spending 46% of their wages on rent.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to be coupled up you can make the affordability of London far better. The majority of renters don\u2019t live on their own, which reduces the costs of renting a property.\n\nOutside of London, the next least affordable place to rent is Oxford, with 44% of a salary spent on rent, followed by Brighton and Cambridge, at 42% and 41.3%, respectively.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what city you want to move to and would prefer a more general estimate, the Zoopla report also looks at how average rent compares in different regions.\n\nThose wanting to cut back on their housing costs are best off moving to the North East, where rent is an average of \u00a3503, with people spending 22.3% of their wages on rent.\n\nRent affordability by region: Average monthly rental prices followed by the year-on-year increase and the affordability for a single earner, showing how much of their money would typically go on rent, according to Zoopla: England, \u00a3900, 2.0%, 32.1%\n\nScotland, \u00a3625, 2.9%, 24.2%\n\nWales, \u00a3592, 1.9%, 24.5%\n\nNorthern Ireland, \u00a3587, 1.8%, 24.9% English regions; East Midlands, \u00a3638, 3.2%, 25.8%\n\nYorkshire and the Humber, \u00a3578, 2.8%, 23.3%\n\nSouth West, \u00a3787, 2.6%, 30.8%\n\nLondon, \u00a31,622, 2.3%, 45.9%\n\nNorth West, \u00a3599, 1.8%, 24.2%\n\nEastern, \u00a3876, 1.6%, 30.2%\n\nSouth East, \u00a31,007, 1.4%, 32.9%\n\nWest Midlands, \u00a3660, 0.8%, 26.6%\n\nRichard Donnell, director of research at Zoopla, said: \u2018Renting is more affordable today than the 10-year average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This follows weak rental growth over the last three years, and an acceleration in the growth of average earnings.\n\n\u2018First-time buyers, 80% of whom exit the private renting sector to buy, has also moderated rental demand.\n\n\u2018Rental affordability varies widely across the country, reflecting the relative strength of local economies.\n\n\u2018High house prices increase the underlying demand for rented homes.\n\n\u2018Meanwhile, in markets where buying is more affordable, rental demand is limited, resulting in lower rental values.\u2019\n\nAcross the UK, homes take 17 days to rent on average \u2013 down from 19 days a year ago.\n\nBut in some cities, the average home rents out much faster than this \u2013 including Brighton (13 days), Nottingham (12 days), Edinburgh (11.3 days), York (10 days), and Bristol (9 days).\n\nHow to get involved in What I Rent What I Rent is Metro.co.uk's weekly series that takes you inside the places people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what's normal and how much we should be paying.
