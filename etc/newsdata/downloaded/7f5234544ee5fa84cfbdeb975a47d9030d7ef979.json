Housing advocates and other civically minded critics were quick to call the boulders out as anti-homeless architecture.\n\nThe Californians forced to live in cars and RVs Read more\n\n\u201cBoulders don\u2019t stop people from drug dealing,\u201d said Jennifer Friedenbach, the executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness. \u201cBut they do stop people from sleeping.\u201d\n\nSo began a tale of Sisyphean feats. An artist put the boulders up for sale on Craigslist. The post was flagged and taken down. Activists rolled the rocks off the sidewalk and into the street. The city, which was not involved in the installation, placed the boulders back. The boulders ended up in the street again. Back on the sidewalk. Back in the street.\n\nAt the heart of this whole saga is a simmering frustration, coming in from all directions, at one specific issue. In a city with a $12bn budget, where new tech millionaires street-park their Teslas and pay for their multimillion dollar condos in cash, more than 8,000 people are forced to sleep in the streets each night.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A street in the Mid-Market neighborhood.

Their concern is for the unhoused, for their ability to access the help and resources they need to get off the streets and into a stable environment.\n\nOn the other end of the continuum, there are the quality-of-life complaints and frustration with the city\u2019s seemingly inability to spark much change \u2013 the qualms with how visible homelessness affects the housed. Chris Herring, a sociology doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley, analyzed 3m 311 calls in a paper published in the American Sociological Review, and found that calls regarding the homeless increased by 781% in San Francisco between 2011 and 2017.\n\n\u201cPeople complain about seeing homelessness. They complain about poop and needles,\u201d said Danielle Baskin, the San Francisco artist who put the boulders up for sale on Craigslist. \u201cThey\u2019re complaining about having it affect their daily commute because they have to step over someone\u2019s sleeping bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel that bad for people who are complaining about homelessness,\u201d Baskin continued. \u201cI feel bad for the homeless people themselves. But I think that nobody knows what to do. That\u2019s the issue.\u201d\n\nDanielle Baskin - Anti-Rock Agitator (@djbaskin) That\u2019s money they could used to help people.\n\n\n\nInstead they tried to hide problems the city\u2019s problems from just their block.\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t even work though.\n\n\n\nThe rocks placement is barbaric and make walking more difficult for everyone. pic.twitter.com/wN0xN6gPx3\n\nThis sentiment was heavy over the alley this week, after the city removed the boulders at the behest of the neighbors. They had been fed up with the constant attempts to roll them into the streets, and are working with local officials to figure out a next step.\n\nOne Clinton Park resident, who asked not to be named, stood across from the sidewalk in question, which, for the moment, was clear of any encampments or activity. He was supportive of the boulders, though he wanted planters \u201cbecause people do view boulders as hostile\u201d. But he\u2019s also supportive of more housing, more shelters, more drug treatment, more mental health treatment and better solutions altogether.\n\nThis resident is a nurse practitioner who works with patients living in single-room occupancy units in the Tenderloin neighborhood \u2013 patients who had recently been homeless and are recovering from drug addiction. He was frustrated with how the whole saga painted everyone who lives in Clinton Park as anti-homeless. The issue wasn\u2019t with people sleeping on the sidewalks, he said. People have been sleeping on that sidewalk for at least the eight years he\u2019s lived in the neighborhood. The issue was with the rampant drug-dealing and drug use.\n\nAlmost half the homeless population in San Francisco suffers from both mental illness and substance abuse disorder, according to the city department of public health.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Calls to 311 regarding the homeless increased by 781% in San Francisco between 2011 and 2017.

But it\u2019s not tidy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been this combination of getting high, getting dope, getting crystal meth and sitting there for days. There are fights, there are fires. This woman was bringing her infant by to score dope.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a situation like that of the neighbors who started a crowdfunding campaign to fight the construction of a homeless shelter, citing reasons such as it was \u201clikely to decrease the fair market value\u201d for any future projects in that wealthy neighborhood, the resident said. In a way, he was almost heartened by the outcry against the boulders. \u201cIt would maybe be worse if people didn\u2019t get excited about it, if they just accepted it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople do care. I could see myself doing it too, decades back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more transitional housing, more navigation centers, more permanent housing, more access to treatment, more something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco has a waitlist of more than 1,100 for a shelter bed. London Breed, the city mayor, is working toward increasing the number of shelter beds by 1,000 by the next year, but in the midst of an affordable housing crisis in which the median rent has risen to $3,700 for a one-bedroom apartment, many in San Francisco are feeling discouraged that they will see any meaningful results.\n\nOftentimes, the complaints about homelessness will drive the city\u2019s efforts, and they end up only addressing visible homelessness rather than the issue itself. In 2016, the city passed a ballot measure banning all tents on city sidewalks \u2013 but rejected a measure that would have raised the sales tax to fund homeless services.\n\nWhat that means is that it\u2019s now illegal for people to camp on the streets, but there\u2019s nowhere for them to go.\n\n\u201cIt just pushes people from place to place,\u201d said Friedenbach. \u201cFor homeless folks, they\u2019re constantly looking for a place to sleep where they won\u2019t bother folks, and then they get pushed out of those areas into more residential areas. Then the neighbors complain, and they get pushed from one residential place to another residential place and no one ends up happy in the end, especially not the homeless folk who end up shuffled from one place to another.\u201d\n\nJef Poskanzer (@jef_poskanzer) The Clinton Park boulders. I got there just before DPW put them back on the sidewalk, and came back later for the second shot.\n\n\n\nThe weird thing is, there's still plenty of room on the sidewalk for sleeping. So the people responsible are not merely assholes, they're also stupid. pic.twitter.com/FRLLvqNRO7\n\nSan Francisco has more anti-homeless laws than any other California city, according to Herring, the sociology doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley who analyzed the 311 calls, but the laws haven\u2019t solved homelessness \u2013 they\u2019ve criminalized it. Police now have the law behind them to move homeless people along when neighbors complain. But they still have nowhere to go. In a 2014 study, Herring found that only 9% of respondents said they moved indoors the last time they were forced to move, they were short-term indoor spaces, such as a library or a bus.\n\n\u201cMost people stayed outside, and the majority of folks stayed within the same neighborhood,\u201d Herring said. \u201cA lot of people are just walking around the corner.\u201d\n\nNo homeless people wandered along Clinton Park, even after the boulders were removed this week. But across the street, Brooks Zorn sat outside Whole Foods, holding a sign reading, \u201cAnything Helps.\u201d\n\nHe was disheartened to hear about the anti-homeless boulders. Overall, he felt that San Francisco was much more friendly to the homeless than where he grew up in Marin county, just over the Golden Gate Bridge, where \u201cyou would get arrested if you\u2019re caught sleeping anywhere\u201d.\n\nJust three years ago, Zorn had steady work as a cook and a place to live.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t view us as homeless people,\u201d Zorn said of the neighbors who installed the boulders. \u201cThey should view us as human beings who just have life problems. They could be one paycheck short of being homeless too. It could happen to them, it could happen to anybody.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Almost half the homeless population in San Francisco suffers from both mental illness and substance abuse disorder, according to the city department of public health.

She had a head injury that was exacerbated when she was hit by a rock while homeless, she said, which she has been on and off since the age of 16. \u201cI\u2019ve been outside too long,\u201d Hayne said.\n\nHayne started to say she understood why people didn\u2019t want homeless people around, and that anti-homeless architecture like the boulders would give the homeless the boost they need to \u201cget inside\u201d before her thoughts ran from her again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just confusing to me because I feel like there should be an inside to get into,\u201d Hayne said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how there\u2019s not.\u201d", "description": "In a city with a $12bn budget and tech millionaires, more than 8,000 people are forced to sleep on the streets each night", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91402d535dfb8805c3ddc6f3e6ec38a45b09fde9/0_164_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e43c653acd958c4c96708f5916e5d684"}
