An EU commission spokesperson confirmed on the record today that there had been no concrete proposals from the UK.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBoris Johnson told the nation on Monday that there had been \u201cprogress\u201d in talks, but it is nowhere to be seen \u2013 the only \u201cprogress\u201d the EU side has been able to point to is that meetings are happening. \u201cProcess progress\u201d, they call it. The UK side has pointed to nothing specific at all.\n\nThe claim last week, briefed by Downing Street, that talks were being \u201cintensified\u201d was always curious \u2013 there was no sign of anything serious actually happening. Chief negotiator David Frost was in town but even UK officials downplayed any chance of a movement ahead of the meetings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that if [Boris Johnson] wanted five days of negotiations per week, the EU would be happy with that, but at the moment, nothing credible has come from the British government in the context of an alternative to the backstop,\u201d Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said last week, summing things up well.\n\n\u201cIf that changes, great. We\u2019ll look at it in Dublin, but more importantly it can be the basis of a discussion in Brussels.\u201d\n\nNo 10 was also caught in another lie today: it had been denying any plans to prorogue parliament, but a Scottish court uncovered emails from days earlier where the plan was approved. It suggest a pattern of untruths.\n\nWhy would Boris Johnson be lying about talks? Despite posturing, it is clear that Conservative leadership wants an election. Their pitch in the election is that they are prepared for no deal, but that they are seeking a deal without the backstop.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But the government\u2019s framing is based on the fiction that Brexit talk are on full swing and that both options are possible.\n\nIf there is an election this apparent fiction will come under increasing pressure.", "description": "The reports today that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2018s top aide, described Brexit talks as \u201ca sham\u201d in a strategy meeting have shed a new light on Brexit talks \u2013 and whether the government is telling the truth about its strategy.
