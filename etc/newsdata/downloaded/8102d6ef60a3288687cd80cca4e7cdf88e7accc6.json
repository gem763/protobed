Moore settled in Washington in 1966 and gained prominence in the city as an acolyte and self-described \u201cpersonal pastor\u201d of black-power leader Stokely Carmichael. In 1974, he won a D.C. Council seat, but his reputation as a volatile provocateur, along with an incident in which he bit a tow-truck driver, led to his loss of a committee chairmanship and a stay in jail. He never again held elective office, although he continued seeking it, most recently with a mayoral run in 2002.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe first drew attention as a 28-year-old clergyman in Durham, N.C., where he brought a confrontational approach to the nascent civil rights struggle. He drank from \u201cwhites-only\u201d public water fountains, then would exclaim, \u201cGood white water!\u201d\n\nHe said activists such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who had been a classmate at the Boston University School of Theology, relied too much at the time on the power of oratory, instead of action, to achieve racial equality.\n\n\u201cI was more educated than most of the whites that segregated against us,\u201d Rev. Moore once told the Washington Informer, a local publication that covers the African American community. \u201cI was just tired of riding on the back of transportations, walking through \u2018colored\u2019 entrances, sipping out of different water fountains and [being] made to feel by other black folk that it was okay.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, June 23, 1957, he led a group of activists into the racially segregated Royal Ice Cream parlor \u2014 a white-owned business in the heart of Durham\u2019s black community. It was around 6:30 p.m. when he and his contingent entered through a whites-only door before taking whites-only seats.\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Cokie Roberts | Cokie Roberts, a journalist and political commentator who became one of the most prominent Washington broadcasters of her era and championed young women in media during a long career with NPR and ABC News, died Sept. 17 in Washington. She was 75. Read the obituary (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nOver the next 15 minutes, their food orders were refused, and a manager asked them to leave. One protester exited when eight police officers arrived \u2014 one for each activist \u2014 and the remaining \u201cRoyal Seven,\u201d as they became known, were escorted to jail.\n\nAll seven were convicted by an all-white jury and fined $10, plus court costs, for trespassing. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear their appeal.\n\nAD\n\nSit-in protests were not yet a mainstream part of the civil rights struggle, and the Royal Seven garnered little attention beyond the local and black press. An alliance of black clergymen in Durham criticized Rev. Moore, calling his sit-in \u201cradical.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe selected Royal Ice Cream because it was surrounded by black people,\u201d he told the Durham Herald-Sun decades later. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d get support. No way. We got the wrath of the community.\u201d\n\nBut the events in Durham proved a harbinger of higher-profile sit-ins, most notably the one that began Feb. 1, 1960, at a segregated Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C.\n\nRev. Moore came from Durham for the demonstration and invited King, who exhorted the young protesters to \u201cfill up the jails of the South\u201d if necessary.\n\nAD\n\nAfter months of protests throughout North Carolina chronicled in the national news, Woolworth opened its lunch counter to all customers \u2014 and made the sit-in a primary tactic of the civil rights movement.\n\nUnlike Rev. Moore\u2019s activists in Durham, the demonstrators in Greensboro benefited from local support, William H. Chafe, a Duke University history professor and author of \u201cCivilities and Civil Rights,\u201d about the Greensboro protests, wrote in an email.\n\nAD\n\nIn Greensboro, the NAACP and the faculty at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College \u201crallied immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cThat did not happen in Durham.\u201d\n\nDouglas Elane Moore was born in Hickory, N.C., on July 23, 1928. His mother was a schoolteacher, his father a high school principal. Several forefathers had been Methodist clergymen.\n\nAD\n\nHis first taste of activism, he once recalled to The Washington Post, was at his high school graduation. He threw away his principal-approved salutatorian address about the greatness of America and instead gave a rousing speech about the 14th and 15th amendments, to the cheers of black students but not the administrators.\n\nHe graduated in 1949 from what is now North Carolina Central University, a historically black college, and received a second bachelor\u2019s degree, in theology, from Boston University in 1953. He began a church ministry in Durham while continuing his studies at BU, where he received a master\u2019s degree in 1958. (A year before, he was also present at the founding of King\u2019s Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta.)\n\nAD\n\nFrom 1962 to 1965, Rev. Moore was a Methodist missionary in Congo, then helped lead an urban renewal project in Washington\u2019s Shaw neighborhood. He officiated at the 1968 wedding between Carmichael and singer Miriam Makeba, served as chairman of the militant Black United Front and espoused incendiary rhetoric as he entered politics (\u201cWhen we get the power, we are going to squeeze the white people.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nHe lost campaigns for school board in 1968 and D.C. delegate in 1971 before winning an at-large seat on the D.C. Council in 1974. \u201cThen began a string of incidents,\u201d The Post\u2019s Juan Williams later wrote, \u201cthe stuff of front-page comic opera.\u201d\n\nRev. Moore threw tantrums from the council dais. He was accused of ramming the car of a woman with whom he had a personal disagreement and throwing a rock through a window at her home. The case was settled out of court.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1975, during an argument with a 19-year-old tow-truck driver whom he accused of blocking his car in a D.C. Council lot, Rev. Moore bit the driver\u2019s back. Rev. Moore claimed he thought the driver, who was white, was trying to assassinate him and invoked the memory of his erstwhile friend King.\n\nAD\n\nRev. Moore, who was stripped of his budget committee chairmanship in 1977, repeatedly refused court-ordered psychiatric examinations. In 1981, a judge sentenced him to six months in jail for ignoring the terms of his probation. He made five more bids for the elective office: for D.C. Council chairman in 1978 and 1986; for council seats in 1979 and 1982; and for mayor in 2002, when he received less than 6 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn 1981, Rev. Moore founded Moore Energy Resources, a fuel and energy brokerage that he operated for 20 years and won lucrative contracts with the region\u2019s power and gas companies. He also was pastor of Elijah United Methodist Church in Poolesville, Md.\n\nAD\n\nHis first marriage, to Daisy Haynes, ended in divorce. In 2000, he married Doris Hughes. In addition to his wife, of Washington, survivors include four children from his first marriage, Douglas Moore Jr., Daisy Moore, Peter Moore and Debessa Moore; five stepchildren, Richard Hughes Jr., Melany Hughes, Candyce Coulibaly, Wilson Hughes and Lewis Hughes; a brother; a sister; and 14 grandchildren.\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He led one of the first sit-ins to protest racial segregation in the South and later served a controversial stint on the D.C.
