(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nHunter Biden announced Sunday that he will step down from the board of a Chinese private equity firm amid allegations of a conflict of interest involving his father, but his statement, issued through an attorney, made no mention of plans to divest his personal stake in the company.\n\nBiden committed in the statement to giving up his unpaid seat on the board of BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co. but did not mention the ten percent stake in the company that he purchased in 2017.\n\nIn 2013, the company received a $1.5 billion investment from the Chinese government, and was officially registered after the Bidens flew together to China aboard Air Force Two.\n\n\u201cWhen Biden\u2019s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund, and the biggest funds in the world can\u2019t get money out of China, and he\u2019s there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that\u2019s a horrible thing,\u201d said Trump in September, accusing the two of improper conduct.\n\nBoth Bidens have strenuously denied allegations of wrongdoing. In response to the attacks, Joe Biden has accused Trump of trying to distract from his own corrupt dealings in the Ukraine, and recently called for Trump\u2019s impeachment for the first time.\n\n\u201cIn full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation, and committed impeachable acts,\u201d Biden told a crowd during a campaign stop in Rochester, New Hampshire.\n\nTrump is currently the subject of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats into whether he improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate allegations against the Bidens in that country.", "description": "Hunter Biden announced he will step down from the board of a Chinese private equity firm, but made no mention of plans to divest his personal stake.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
