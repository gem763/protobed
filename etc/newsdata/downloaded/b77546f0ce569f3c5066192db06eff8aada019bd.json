They live in Texas.\n\nThe daughters' claimed discovery of shared DNA with at least five strangers \u2014 people born between 1976 and 1997 \u2014 came through use of Ancestry.com and 23andMe.com, KUSA reported.\n\nThe daughters confronted their mother, who disclosed earlier this year that she had had artificial insemination procedures by Jones to conceive.\n\n\"I would like to ask him, 'Why? Why did you do this?\" said Boring, who lives in San Antonio.\n\nJones, of Grand Junction, refused to answer when asked if he'd donated his own sperm to father the children.\n\n\"I don't deny it. I don't admit it,\" he told KUSA.\n\nJones, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology, has been licensed to practice medicine in Colorado on July 11, 1972. He co-founded what's now known as Women's Health Care of Western Colorado, where the suit claims he saw Cheryl Emmons from 1979 to 1985.\n\nTexas this year passed a law barring a fertility doctor from inseminating a patient without her consent. California and Indiana have so-called \"fertility fraud\" laws, but Colorado does not.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: KUSA-TV, http://www.9news.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
