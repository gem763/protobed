The protesters said Iraqi soldiers had been stationed around the protest site but withdrew after the attackers began firing teargas and live fire.\n\nAmid a clampdown by security forces, it was difficult to piece together what exactly prompted the attack. There were differing accounts and death toll estimates.\n\nThe provincial governor, Nassif al-Khattabi, denied that any protesters were killed but said there were some injuries among security forces.\n\nHe said videos that had spread online were fabricated and not from Karbala. Footage purporting to show the aftermath of the attack showed fires and people running away to the backdrop of heavy gunfire. His description contradicted that of people who were at the scene.\n\nAn AP video showed a night-time fire and young protesters, some of them taking cellphone footage, as gunfire echoes in the background. An ambulance can be seen trying to drive amid the chaos, and Iraqi security forces arriving at the scene.\n\nThe protests across Iraq, leaderless and largely spontaneous, have been met with bullets and teargas by security forces.\n\nAt least 73 protesters \u2013 not including the latest fatalities in Karbala \u2013 have been killed since anti-government demonstrations resumed on Friday, after 149 were killed during an earlier wave of protests this month.\n\nTuesday\u2019s attack happened in Karbala\u2019s Education Square, where protesters had set up tents.\n\n\u201cWe saw masked men dressed all in black and they fired live bullets toward the square,\u201d one demonstrator said. \u201cPeople fell dead and wounded right next to me. We tried to escape but when we fled into the alleys we ran into moving checkpoints set up by these forces. They arrested people and searched their phones for video of what had happened.\u201d\n\nAnother witness said hundreds of protesters were in the encampment when someone opened fire from a passing car. Masked gunmen in black plainclothes arrived and started shooting at the protesters.\n\nIraqi security officials confirmed the death toll, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to reporters.\n\nKarbala, along with Baghdad and cities across southern Iraq, has been gripped by a wave of anti-government protests that have often turned violent, with security forces opening fire and demonstrators torching government buildings and headquarters of Iran-backed militias.\n\nThe demonstrations have erupted in Shia-majority areas and have been directed at the Shia-dominated government and Shia political parties and militias, many of which are supported by neighbouring Iran.\n\nThe demonstrations are fuelled by anger at corruption, economic stagnation and poor public services. Despite its vast oil wealth, Iraq suffers from high unemployment and crumbling infrastructure, with frequent power outages that force many to rely on private generators. The protests have grown and demonstrators are now calling for sweeping changes, not only the government\u2019s resignation.", "description": "At least 18 people killed and hundreds injured as anti-government protests continue", "authors": ["Associated Press In Baghdad"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac53347f7522cba4ea45ac720e87684b9f41e9fb/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=961c7f95667cc395ec99aa92858dbe9b", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
