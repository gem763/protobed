This might just be the most horrid ring I have ever seen,' one user said of the design, while another added: 'I'm really sorry to be mean but this is it. Probably OFFICIALLY, THE UGLIEST RING.'", "description": "A Texas-based woman shared an image of her ring in the Facebook group That's It, I'm Ring Shaming, where it was promptly ripped to pieces by other users.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/17/19597680-0-image-a-131_1570810208944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
