Andersch said:\n\n\u201cHistorically speaking, it has invariably been the commodity with the highest stock-to-flow ratio at that juncture which has been used as money because this enabled the best value transfer over time.\u201d\n\nThe stock-to-flow ratio of a commodity such as gold is the amount of the asset that is held in reserves, divided by the amount of the asset produced annually.\n\nThe author concludes the report by saying that the Bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio is certain to substantially increase in May 2020, adding:\n\n\u201cIf the May 2020 stock-to-flow ratio for Bitcoin is factored into the model, a vertiginous price of around USD 90,000 emerges. This would imply that the forthcoming halving effect has hardly been priced into the current Bitcoin price of approximately USD 8,000.\u201d\n\nGold bug pounces on Bitcoin price drop\n\nClearly not everyone will agree with BayernLB\u2019s price prediction. Cointelegraph previously reported that gold bug Peter Schiff returned to bashing Bitcoin as it fell from $9,700 to a low of $7,990 in hours. The Bitcoin critic claimed the shedding of $1,800 was just the start, saying:", "description": "German bank BayernLB has published its latest report on Bitcoin vs gold and thinks BTC is about to take a big leap forward in 2020", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9iMDA4OTM0OTZhNWU2NDZiY2JiNTNiZjlhMjhhZmMzOS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
