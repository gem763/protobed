Two seemingly distant worlds, united by a shared belief in the power of design, are about to become one. #TheDesignerAlliance #Porsche #TheRiseOfSkywalker https://t.co/jRDU8Nmq0D pic.twitter.com/BVMtt2hpB3 \u2014 Porsche (@Porsche) October 23, 2019\n\nThe model will be designed and created over upcoming weeks in Stuttgart and in San Francisco.\n\nBeside the reveal of the spacecraft, Porsche will also be showcasing the Porsche Taycan, the brand's first all-electric car. Deliveries in the US will begin at the end of the year, and deliveries in Europe will commence in early 2020.\n\nThe starship will be presented during the world premiere of \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" in December.
