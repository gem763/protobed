In May 2018, the president withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear accord, deriding it as a one-sided deal.\n\nSince then, the Trump administration has imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran and accused the regime of being behind several aggressive actions in the region, including attacks on international oil tankers and the downing of a U.S. Navy drone.\n\nTop U.S. officials like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have publicly blamed Iran for the oil plant attacks. After days of considering options to respond, Mr. Trump on Friday ordered the deployment of additional troops and missile systems to both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut during his interview on \"Face the Nation,\" Zarif denied any Iranian involvement in the attacks, saying the country's supreme leader would have had to order such an operation, and he did not. He accused the Trump administration of \"posturing\" by sending more troops to the region, which he said would benefit from an end to the Saudi-led military intervention in war-torn Yemen.\n\nZarif suggested his government would be open to allowing a team of international investigators to probe the attacks and determine the culprit. But he said they needed to be \"impartial.\"\n\n\"Let them do that because it would take a miracle for them to claim that, because it didn't come from Iran. Period,\" Zarif said.", "description": "\"I'm confident that we will not start one but I'm confident that whoever starts one will not be the one who finishes it,\" Zarif told \"Face the Nation\"", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/22/18488377-158b-404f-b381-15b3a1e8e96c/thumbnail/1200x630g3/dacb7cf94bc5e640f629d6f3e4c62499/zarif.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
