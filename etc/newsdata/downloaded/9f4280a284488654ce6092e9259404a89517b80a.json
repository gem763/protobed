And the Schottenstein Center would have been sold out every single night if I was there. Me and my mom, we didn\u2019t have anything. We wouldn\u2019t have been able to benefit at all from it. The university would have been able to capitalize on everything.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCritics have decried the NCAA\u2019s treatment of athletes as exploitative for decades. Now, James is putting his name, influence and \u201cUninterrupted\u201d media platform behind legal efforts aimed at empowering college athletes to profit from their images and likenesses.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a bill Monday that will permit college athletes in his state to receive financial compensation through endorsement deals and sponsorships, among other opportunities. The first-of-its-kind Fair Pay to Play Act, which had already passed through the California legislature and is set to go into effect in 2023, would also allow student-athletes to hire agents without compromising their scholarships. The law does not mandate that players receive payment from their schools.\n\nNewsom joined James and his business partners, Rich Paul and Maverick Carter, on Uninterrupted\u2019s \u201cThe Shop,\u201d to make the signing official.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLakers\u2019 LeBron James on \u201cfair pay to play\u201d: If he had gone to OSU, \u201cthat 23 jersey would have been sold all over the place without my name on the back.

A billion-plus revenue goes to the NCAA itself. The actual product, the folks who are putting their lives on the line and everything on the line, are getting nothing. [This act] is going to initiate dozens of other states to introduce similar legislation. It\u2019s going to change college sports for the better by finally having the interests of the athletes on par with the interests of the institutions. Now we\u2019re rebalancing that power.\u201d\n\nThe Fair Pay to Play Act potentially has far-reaching implications. California colleges and universities \u2014 including Pac-12 Conference members Cal, Stanford, UCLA and USC \u2014 could lose their NCAA memberships and NCAA conference affiliations if the NCAA does not alter its rules by 2023. The Pac-12 Conference expressed its disappointment at the bill\u2019s passage in a statement Monday, warning that it would have \u201cvery significant negative consequences,\u201d including a \u201cnegative disparate impact on female student-athletes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur universities have led important student-athlete reform over the past years,\u201d the statement read, \u201cbut firmly believe all reforms must treat our student-athletes as students pursuing an education, and not as professional athletes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 34-year-old James, whose son Bronny is a 14-year-old high school freshman and a well-regarded basketball prospect, hailed the signing of the Fair Pay to Play Act as a \u201cgreat day\u201d and a \u201cwin for the state of California.\u201d He also singled out former UCLA basketball star Ed O\u2019Bannon, who was the lead plaintiff in a 2009 lawsuit against the NCAA over the uncompensated use of football and basketball players in video games.\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to have the governor come on our show and sign what we believe is a historical change,\u201d James said while wearing a shirt that bore his \u201cMore than an athlete\u201d tagline. \u201cI was one of those underprivileged kids. Obviously, I was fortunate enough and talented enough to skip college. I understand what those kids are going through. I feel for those kids. That\u2019s why it was personal to me. \u2026 It\u2019s the NCAA\u2019s turn to step up.\u201d\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox\n\nRead more:\n\nAfter a long summer, LeBron James eases back onto center stage with the Lakers\n\nEven with a lift from Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Clippers plan to keep doing the dirty work\n\nKyrie Irving shines a light on an overlooked issue in the NBA: grief\n\nAD", "description": "James hosted California Gov.
