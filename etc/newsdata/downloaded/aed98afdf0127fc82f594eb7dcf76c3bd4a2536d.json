President trump publicly calling another foreign government to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. This time China. And here's why this is so remarkable, federal law clearly says it is illegal to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with an election. Jonathan Karl has this part of the story, good morning, Jon. Reporter: Good morning, Cecilia. President trump is so insistent that he did nothing wrong, that he did it again, calling on yet another foreign country to investigate a political rival committing yet another likely impeachable act but this time doing it before the cameras. This time you didn't need a secret transcript of a private phone call. The president did it out in the open for the world to see. China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with -- with Ukraine. Reporter: He even suggested he might directly ask the president of China for help. You asked president XI to investigate? I haven't but something we can start thinking about. Reporter: It comes ahead of trade talks with the Chinese scheduled in Washington for next week. I have a lot of options on China, but if they don't do what we want we have tremendous, tremendous power. Reporter: The president's words this time are especially remarkable because he is suggesting a foreign government investigate his political rival at the very moment he is facing impeachment proceedings for doing just that. Asking Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. It's an echo from this infamous moment from the 2016 campaign. Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. Reporter: Back then trump aides insisted he was joking. They aren't saying that now. Democrats say the president's latest comments may amount to another impeachable offense. It's wrong for the president of the United States to seek help from a foreign power in a presidential election. That's not okay. I think his actions today create anoer article of impeachment. Reporter: And Republicans aren't exactly running out to defend him on this one. I don't want to comment on something I haven't seen. Would you ever ask China to look into somebody running against you for your congressional seat. You're asking a hypothetical I'dary not get into because I don't know if I'd ever be in that situation. Reporter: And if there were any doubt that the call to investigate Biden were part of a political strategy, consider this, the trump campaign plans nearly $1 million worth of commercials to air this weekend attacking Biden over his son hunter's dealings in Ukraine and, George, those ads will air in all of the key democratic early primary states including New Hampshire, South Carolina and Iowa. Even though they contain charges that are inaccurate and false.
