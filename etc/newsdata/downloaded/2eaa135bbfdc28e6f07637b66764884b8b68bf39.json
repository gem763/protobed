Now, arguably the most important man at the Etihad, Sterling looks set to compete outright for the honour for many years to come.\n\nRaheem Sterling looks set to content for the Ballon d'Or for many seasons to come\n\nFrenkie de Jong - Barcelona\n\nThough he tries to brush it aside, the mercurial Dutchman has been compared endlessly to Johan Cruyff.\n\nWhen you become one of the latest signings for Barcelona, that sure is some pressure to deal with.\n\nDespite being just 22, De Jong scooped UEFA's Midfielder of the Season award for the previous campaign, in which he played a crucial role in guiding Ajax to the Champions League semi-finals.\n\nNow pulling the string at the Nou Camp and getting better by the week, De Jong's Ballon d'Or odds look set to shorten season upon season.\n\nUEFA Midfielder of the Season Frenkie de Jong, now of Barcelona, made the final shortlist\n\nMatthijs de Ligt - Juventus\n\nAlongside De Jong, central defender De Ligt was the other prime reason why Ajax performed so impressively.\n\nBoth Dutch youngsters missed out on the Ballon d'Or shortlist this time last year, due to the incredible European run only then being in its infancy.\n\nLike his compatriot, De Ligt sealed a huge summer move away from Ajax. While it has been a relatively slow start to life at Juventus, the 20-year-old has his eyes set on becoming one of the very few defenders to lift the golden orb.\n\nVirgil van Dijk - Liverpool\n\nGiven his sheer dominance in the last 18 months, it's puzzling to comprehend how Van Dijk has only now made the final shortlist.\n\nHis rise at Liverpool, since briefly becoming the world's most expensive defender, has been nothing short of meteoric. The experienced Dutchman has completely transformed Jurgen Klopp's team and, at 28, is expected to feature as a Ballon d'Or mainstay.\n\nSo unstoppable has Van Dijk's run of form been, the Liverpool rock is now placed as favourite to win the honour and become the first defender to do so since Fabio Cannavaro in 2006.\n\nVirgil van Dijk has emerged as perhaps the world's best defender, and is now favourite to win\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum - Liverpool\n\nAnother Dutchman and another Liverpool star, Gini Wijnaldum has been a quiet assassin in the rise of the sleeping Merseyside giants.\n\nTrusted to do a specific role week-in, week-out by Klopp, Wijnaldum maintains to consistently be a vital cog which helps the Liverpool machine run at full-power.\n\nThough often overlooked because of the perceived simplicity of his role, Wijnaldum is now being praised by the high powers that be in football.\n\nGini Wijnaldum maintains to consistently be a vital cog which helps the Liverpool machine run\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold - Liverpool\n\nAt just 21, Alexander-Arnold's career record is already starting to beggar belief.\n\nPlaying in back-to-back European cup finals, before heading to the World Cup, the full-back has plenty of experience in his young legs already.\n\nThe corner played in for Divock Origi against Barcelona in the semi-finals of last season's Champions League has already been cemented in the football annals, giving the Liverpool man a place among the world's finest in the shortlist of nominees.\n\nYoungster Trent Alexander-Arnold already has a remarkable amount of experience in his legs\n\nDusan Tadic - Ajax\n\nThough De Jong and De Ligt moved onto pastures new, Tadic remained at Ajax and continues to be a driving force for the side.\n\nOnce written off at Southampton, Tadic's reward for a sublime season has equated to Ballon d'Or recognition.\n\nAt 30, Tadic is the oldest newcomer to make the final cut for the first time.\n\nOnce of Southampton, Dusan Tadic has reinvented himself at Ajax and developed immensely\n\nDonny van de Beek - Ajax\n\nIt was to be expected that Ajax players would have a large baring on the 2019 awards, so strong was their prior season.\n\nVan de Beek remains at the club, and appears to have even gone up a level since the Champions League semi-final exploits.\n\nLinked frequently with Real Madrid, the 22-year-old seems to be a relatively under-the-radar character who could well shape the future of European football.\n\nLike Tadic, Donny van de Beek went fairly under the radar as Ajax shocked the whole of Europe\n\nMarc-Andre ter-Stegen - Barcelona\n\nPerhaps the most consistent goalkeeper in world football, Ter-Stegen could also be seen as the most under-rated.\n\nPlaying as understudy to Manuel Neuer on the international scene has not helped matters, but now the Barcelona man is getting the plaudits he deserves.\n\nNow considered an equal among the final cut of players, Ter-Stegen will bid to become the only goalkeeper since the legendary Lev Yashin to win the award.\n\nPerhaps the most consistent keeper in world football, Marc Andre Ter-Stegen makes the cut\n\nBernardo Silva - Manchester City\n\nForcing his way into the Manchester City set-up last season, Bernardo placed manager Guardiola into a position where he simply could not afford to bench him.\n\nThe diminutive Portuguese star became a mainstay in both Premier League and European matchday squads, and eased through to the final cut of the Ballon d'Or nominees for the first time as result.\n\nBernardo Silva his way into the Manchester City set-up with a string of incredible displays\n\nHeung-min Son - Tottenham\n\nThe ever present diamond in a turbulent Tottenham team, Son always appears to be the man to count upon.\n\nLast season he had a huge say in Spurs reaching the Champions League final, while the current campaign has still seen him as the go-to guy as times get tough.\n\nRather than playing in the shadow of Harry Kane, the South Korean has quietly and confidently emerged as his peer.\n\nRemarkably consistent South Korean star Son is seen as the go-to guy at Tottenham\n\nKalidou Koulibaly - Napoli\n\nAt the same age as Van Dijk, Kouilbaly is another experienced star who finds himself as a newcomer to the shortlist scene.\n\nThe Senegal international has been a rock at the heart of the Napoli defence for the past few seasons, boasting a remarkable record.\n\nWhile very much an outside bet to go on and win the honour, Koulibaly remains tipped for one huge transfer before his career enters its twilight stage.\n\nKalidou Kouilbaly is another experienced star who finds himself as a newcomer\n\nJoao Felix - Atletico Madrid\n\nThe new kid on the block, Joao Felix has the pressure on his shoulders of being dubbed the next Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nNow playing with his mentor on the international scene, Felix is expected to learn from the Ballon d'Or veteran at every opportunity.\n\nMoving to Atletico Madrid ensured the young playmaker would continue to play regular football, which will be vital if he is to go on and win the award in the coming years.\n\nThe wonderkid of European football, Joao Felix is expected to become a Ballon d'Or regular\n\nMarquinhos - Paris Saint Germain\n\nA solid season in France has seen Marquinhos elevate his status to now be considered among the best in the sport.\n\nThe Brazil defender has flourished alongside Thiago Silva, and now looks set to replace his compatriot both domestically and internationally.\n\nA solid season in France saw Marquinhos elevate his status to seen among the world's best", "description": "A number of footballers have been pinching themselves this week, after making the final shortlist for the prestigious Ballon d'Or award -
