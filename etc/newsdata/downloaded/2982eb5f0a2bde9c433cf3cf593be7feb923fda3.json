His muscles are still paralysed.\n\nThe breakthrough has been published in medical journal The Lancet Neurology, with researchers labelling the exoskeleton an 'exciting advance'.\n\nHowever, the technology is still in its early days and far from being used in daily life. Further trials on other patients are planned.\n\nCurrently there is no cure for quadriplegia, forcing most sufferers to spend the rest of their lives in wheelchairs and needing round-the-clock care.\n\nThe robotic skeleton is controlled by brain signals that are collected with sensors. They are placed between the skull and the brain over areas that control movement\n\nThe 30-year-old, named only as Thibault, was paralysed from the neck down in 2015 after falling 50 feet (15m) from a nightclub roof (pictured walking using the exoskeleton)\n\nBut he has been able to move for the first time since his horrific injury through using the pioneering suit, following months of getting to grips with it (pictured wearing the suit)\n\nHeartwarming footage captured the 30-year-old 'walking' after months of getting to grips with the device (pictured). It's attached to harness on the ceiling for support\n\nThibault had a cervical spinal cord injury, considered to be one of the most severe types of spinal cord injury. Most are caused by car accidents\n\nIf proven to work on other paralysed patients, the device could revolutionise life for the estimated 50,000 Britons and 290,000 Americans living with a spinal cord injury.\n\nThibault had a cervical spinal cord injury, considered to be one of the most severe types of spinal cord injury. Most are caused by car accidents.\n\nAround 20 per cent of these patients are left quadriplegic, meaning all four limbs are partially or completely paralysed.\n\nThibault was paralysed from the shoulders down, with only some movement in his biceps and left wrist to operate his wheelchair joystick.\n\nHOW DOES THE EXOSKELETON WORK? If the spinal cord is damaged or injured, messages to and from the brain don't send properly, and movement can stop. The exoskeleton, which is attached to the ceiling for support, is designed to collect these messages and move how the patient wishes to. Two sensors containing 64 electrodes each are placed underneath the skull, over areas of the brain that control movement in the limbs. These sensors collect brain signals from Thibault, software decodes what they mean and then the exoskeleton with 14 joints receives directions. The placing of the sensors depends on which parts of the spinal cord are damaged and what movements a patient isn't able to do.\n\nBut now, after two years of brain training, he can finally move again, revealed the researchers at the University of Grenoble.\n\nThibault said: 'It\u2019s not an exoskeleton for going to the bar with my friends but I\u2019ve achieved something that\u2019s a first.\n\n'I didn\u2019t move for two years and I had forgotten what it was like to stand. I forgot I was taller than a lot of people in the room and it was very impressive.'\n\nLead author Professor Alim-Louis Benabid said: 'Our patient already considers his rapidly increasing prosthetic mobility to be rewarding.'\n\nHowever, he added that Thibault's clinical status remains the same. Another doctor said the trial moves them a 'step closer to helping tetraplegic patients'\n\nThey added it could lead to 'wheelchairs using brain activity instead of joysticks and progressing to developing an exoskeleton for increased mobility'.\n\nIf the spinal cord is damaged or injured, messages to and from the brain don't send properly, and movement can stop.\n\nThe exoskeleton is designed to collect these messages and move how the patient wishes to. It uses an AI algorithm to learn how the patient thinks.\n\nSensors are placed in the head between the skull and the brain, over areas of the brain that control movement in the limbs.\n\nThibault said: 'It\u2019s not an exoskeleton for going to the bar with my friends but I\u2019ve achieved something that\u2019s a first' (pictured with doctors at a laboratory at the University of Grenoble)\n\nPictured, scientists holding an implant which was placed inside Thibault's head\n\nSensors are placed in the head between the skull and the brain over areas that control sensation and motor function. Pictured, the placement of the sensors\n\nThe patient learnt to control limbs of a virtual avatar using just his brain first\n\nHe slowly started to use the exoskeleton machine to touch objects (pictured)\n\nUsing the avatar, video game and exoskeleton combined, the man covered a total of 145 metres with 480 steps, according to findings published in The Lancet Neurology\n\nThe researchers hope the technology can be used to help wheelchair-bound patients use just their brain to control their wheelchairs\n\nWHAT IS A CERVICAL SPINAL CORD INJURY? The cervical spinal cord is the uppermost region of the vertebrae and is in the neck. It is made up of seven sections - C1-to-C7. The higher the injury to the spine, the more severe the damage and the more likely it will be life threatening. A C1-C4 spinal cord injury affects the high-cervical nerves. It's the most severe of the spinal cord injury levels, paralysing the arms, hands, trunk and legs. A patient may not be able to breathe on his or her own, cough, or control bowel or bladder movements. Ability to speak is sometimes impaired or reduced. When all four limbs are affected, this is called tetraplegia or quadriplegia. It requires complete assistance with activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, bathing, and getting in or out of bed. The patient may be able to use powered wheelchairs with special controls to move around on their own, but will not be able to drive a car on their own. Sometimes the patient requires 24-hour-a-day personal care. An 'incomplete' spinal cord injury means the ability of the spinal cord to convey messages to or from the brain is not completely lost. Although a quadriplegic cannot move their limbs, 'incomplete' often means they still have some sensation in their arms and legs, even if it is faint. Some quadriplegics have been able to regain some function once swelling goes down or if they have surgery to remove something pressing on their spinal cord.\n\nThis placing would vary depending on which parts of the spinal cord are damaged and what movements a patient isn't able to do.\n\nEach sensor contains a grid of 64 electrodes, which collect brain signals, decode what they mean, and then direct the exoskeleton.\n\nAnother patient in the trial was excluded because a technical glitch stopped the brain implants communicating with the algorithm. The implants were removed.\n\nAlthough the gadget is 'exciting', Professor Tom Shakespeare, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it must be remembered that the research is in its infancy.\n\nWriting in a linked comment, also published in The Lancet Neurology, he said: 'A danger of hype always exists in this field.\n\n'Even if ever workable, cost constraints mean that high-tech options are never going to be available to most people in the world with spinal cord injury.\n\n'One analysis suggests that only 15 per cent of the world's disabled population have access to the wheelchairs or other assistive technologies that they need.\n\n'An originality of this study is showing the control of four limbs, whereas in most previous studies only one limb was controlled.\n\n'Although this study presents a welcome and exciting advance, we must remember that proof of concept is a long way from usable clinical possibility.'\n\nThe patient spent two years progressing with the exoskeleton and practiced using video simulations - such as making an avatar walk in a video game.\n\nHe was able to make the exoskeleton walk while attached to a suspended harness on the ceiling to support him.\n\nEach exoskeleton movement uses a different number of 'dimensions of movement' - turning a switch uses three dimensions of movement.\n\nThibault said: 'I didn\u2019t move for two years and I had forgotten what it was like to stand. I forgot I was taller than a lot of people in the room and it was very impressive'\n\nLead author Professor Alim-Louis Benabid (pictured) said: 'Our patient already considers his rapidly increasing prosthetic mobility to be rewarding'\n\nThe exoskeleton is able to move in 14 dimensions - reaching an object and turning the wrist uses eight.\n\nUsing the avatar, video game and exoskeleton combined, Thibault covered a total of 475 feet (145m) with 480 steps over 39 sessions.\n\nHe was able to perform tasks with an average of 10-20 per cent greater success using the exoskeleton than with the avatar.\n\nThe authors suggest this is because feedback with the avatar is purely visual, whereas with the exoskeleton the patient gets richer feedback from the real world.\n\nThe system has promise for being suitable for daily use because it didn't need to be re-set for up to seven weeks.\n\nInterfaces placed in the brain that collect messages have been developed before, but they haven't been wireless.\n\nProfessor Benabid said: 'Ours is the first semi-invasive wireless brain-computer system designed for long term use to activate all four limbs.\n\n'Previous brain-computer studies have used more invasive recording devices implanted beneath the outermost membrane of the brain, where they eventually stop working.\n\n'They have also been connected to wires, limited to creating movement in just one limb, or have focused on restoring movement to patients' own muscles.'\n\nThe researchers will now conduct trials on three more patients.
