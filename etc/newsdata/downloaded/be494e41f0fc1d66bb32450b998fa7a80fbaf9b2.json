The stadium concert venue for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s Frank and Kula Kumpuris Distinguished Lecture \u2060\u2014 a series from the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton School of Public Service \u2060\u2014 sold out mere minutes after the reservation link for lecture went live earlier this summer, quickly outgrowing its original location, the Jack Stephens Center at UA Little Rock.\n\nFollowing an adoring introduction by President Bill Clinton, who appointed Ginsburg to the Supreme Court in 1993, esteemed NPR journalist Nina Totenberg sat opposite Ginsburg posing questions, all carefully worded to produce the choicest of Ginsburg anecdotes. Between the two women: years of mutual admiration, a vase of flowers and a pair of coffee mugs emblazoned with bold capital letters so that together, they spelled out \u201cDIS-SENT\u201d \u2060\u2014 a nod to the justice\u2019s famed penchant for impassioned disagreements with the court\u2019s majority opinions.\n\nBrian Chilson\n\nWell before 4 p.m. Tuesday, cars had swarmed the sun-drenched blocks surrounding the arena, security teeming. The thermostat in the arena had been knocked down a degree or ten, seemingly bracing itself for the influx of body heat that\u2019d barrel through the doors when they opened to the public.\n\nAnd, when that happened, Ginsburg showed up early \u2060\u2014 on the fronts of t-shirts, emblazoned on the sides of tote bags and in subtler sartorial nods \u2014 a gavel-shaped brooch here, a white plumed chiffon bow-tie blouse mimicking a judge\u2019s collar there. (Fittingly, the gentle Bela Fleck tunes wafting from the loudspeaker early in the afternoon gave way to bolder statements: Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cFighter\u201d and Zara Larsson\u2019s \u201cMake That Money Girl.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Chilson\n\nHalf feminist superhero, 100 percent pop culture icon, Ginsburg hasn\u2019t so much taken the sledgehammer to the proverbial glass ceiling as she has chipped away at it with her gavel \u2014 reproducing a blueprint of the ceiling\u2019s dimensions, studying it with a surgeon\u2019s precision and taking its architects to court.\n\nHer biography is one long mic drop \u2014 the daughter of a Jewish immigrant who got demoted from a job for becoming pregnant, then tied for first in her class at Columbia Law School. She\u2019d (literally) write the school\u2019s casebook for sex discrimination, and then meet that discrimination head-on in her own career, triumphing over her detractors with strategically timed arguments, with legendary dissents or \u2014 as she detailed in an interview with Totenberg earlier this year \u2014 by simply outliving them. There\u2019s a reason an entire island at the Clinton Presidential Center\u2019s gift shop is bedecked with RBG merch; Ginsburg is an OG feminist, a fiery queen of one-liners and an absolute master of navigating tricky moral territory \u2014 at once the Patroness Saint of dissent and the picture of scrupulous caution, simultaneously a fearless pioneer and a steadfast steward of constitutional precedent. She\u2019s the subject of an opera, a Lego figurine, multiple documentaries and a viral Internet meme cementing her badassery with a formidable nickname: the Notorious R.B.G.\n\nClinton spoke of Ginsburg as \u201crigorous but warm-hearted,\u201d someone who he\u2019d hoped could \u201ctranslate the hopes of the American people\u201d into policy. He recalled her nomination process, and the day when she \u2014 then Judge Ginsburg \u2014 became, for him, the clear frontrunner among the three remaining candidates. \u201cHillary and other people,\u201d Clinton said, \u201chad already told me I needed to take a hard look at Judge Ginsburg. You need to know about this person because she\u2019s a person who actually lives what she believes.\u201d For Ginsburg, he said, \u201c \u2018We the People\u2019 means all of us.\u201d\n\nAnd, he joked that he\u2019d tried to entertain Ginsburg in the moments in the way over to the arena, telling her about his \u201cadventures and misadventures\u201d in Arkansas politics. \u201cOne thing I did not see coming,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cwas her ascendance to pop culture icon. Her workout routine is to be marveled at. \u2026 You can see her image on t-shirts, coffee mugs and tote bags the world over,\u201d Clinton said, and added, with performative jealousy: \u201cYou might come to resent such a person.\u201d Clinton\u2019s biggest applause line, though, came at 7:05 p.m., when he said: \u201cOnly one person here appointed her. One person here voted for her \u2014 Sen. David Pryor. But we all hope that she will stay on that court forever.\u201d\n\nGinsburg, decked out in black lace gloves and an elegant patterned blazer with black piping, stopped halfway up the stairs to acknowledge the thunderous reception from the crowd, the size of which Totenberg said was (ahem) unprecedented for her and Ginsburg\u2019s appearances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Chilson Brian Chilson\n\nA few highlights:\n\nThe fact that Ginsburg refers to her fellow Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan as \u201csisters in law.\u201d Swoon.\n\nThe aforementioned black lace gloves. (Anything to keep RBG from catching cold on account of all those handshakes she\u2019s probably offered, right?)\n\nBrian Chilson Brian Chilson\n\nGinsburg on whether women\u2019s voices are undervalued (or ignored) in the workplace: \u201cWell, that happened more than once. If I make a comment, no reaction. Then one of my male colleagues would say basically the same thing, and there would be a reaction. You don\u2019t expect very much from a woman, so you tune out when she speaks. Now that I have two sisters-in-law, it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nGinsburg on her unlikely friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia: \u201cHe had a marvelous sense of humor. \u2026 He would sometimes come to my chambers or call me and say, \u2018Ruth, you\u2019ve made a grammatical error. I don\u2019t want to embarrass you by sending a note that would be circulated in a note to all of our colleagues, but you need to fix this up.\u2019 \u201c\n\nGinsburg, slyly, on her meetings with Clinton during the nomination process: \u201cSometimes with men, I detect a certain discomfort when talking with women. It was not that way with Bill Clinton.\u201d\n\nThat part where Nina Totenberg paused a little while recollecting the margin by which Justice Ginsburg\u2019s nomination was confirmed, and Ginsburg stepped in with a firm reminder: \u201c96 to 3.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGinsburg on her first days as a woman on the Court, aside Justice Sandra Day O\u2019 Connor: \u201cIn our robing room, there was a bathroom that said \u2018MEN.\u2019 Justice O\u2019Connor had to go all the way back to her chambers. And when I came, they created a women\u2019s bathroom.\u201d\n\nTotenberg\u2019s word choice when asking Ginsburg to describe the year of her Supreme Court appointment, which seemingly lifted 16,000 sets of good Southern eyebrows at the halfway mark: \u201cThe year was 1993. The president was flirting with all manner of \u2026 Supreme Court nominations.\u201d\n\nGinsburg on her son: \u201cMy son was a lively child. I called him lively. His teachers called him hyperactive.\u201d\n\nGinsburg, recalling how, on a particularly difficult day at the law office, she\u2019d replied to a representative at her son\u2019s school who\u2019d beckoned Ginsburg to come address his latest mischief: \u201cThis child has two parents. Please alternate the calls.\u201d\n\nGinsburg on 2006-2009, the years after O\u2019Connor retired, when she was the only woman on the Court: \u201cIt was a lonely position. The public would see these eight \u2014 rather well-fed \u2014 men!\u201d\n\nGinsburg on her recent treatments for pancreatic cancer: \u201cAug. 23 was the last session. But I had promised the Clinton Foundation that I would be here. [standing ovation] \u2026 And I\u2019m pleased to say, I am feeling very good tonight!\u201d\n\nBrian Chilson Brian Chilson\n\nGinsburg on working while facing adverse health conditions: \u201cI think my work is what saved me. Instead of dwelling on my physical discomforts \u2026 I know I have to get it done, so I have to get over it. Justice O\u2019Connor had a mastectomy and she was on the bench nine days after her surgery.\u201d\n\nOn Weinberger vs. Weisenfeld: \u201cIt is one example of how gender-based discrimination hurts everyone. It hurts women, it hurts men, it hurts children.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Stephanie Smittle Is Culture Editor For The Arkansas Times", "An Advocate For The Natural State'S Rich History Of Musicians"], "top_image": "https://237995-729345-1-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NKW2364_1200.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
