She will dine with President Xi Jinping in the evening.\n\nThe German leader faces the challenge of balancing human rights concerns and economic discussions with one of Germany\u2019s largest trading partners.\n\n\u201cI indicated during the talks that the rights and freedoms agreed upon in Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law should be safeguarded,\u201d Merkel said during a joint news briefing with Li. The Basic Law is Hong Kong\u2019s de facto constitution, which promises the semi-autonomous Chinese city certain democratic rights not afforded to the mainland.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The relationship is important to Europe\u2019s largest economy, particularly as Germany is considered likely to enter a technical recession in the current quarter.\n\nGermany long had amicable relations with Beijing because its exporters ran a surplus supplying Chinese factories with equipment and components. But those ties increasingly are strained over German complaints about market access and Chinese technology policy.\n\nBeijing tried without success to recruit Germany as an ally in its tariff war with President Donald Trump. While Merkel\u2019s government has echoed U.S. complaints, it objects to Trump\u2019s tactics, which he has also used against Europe.\n\nMerkel is in Beijing with a high-ranking German business delegation that includes executives in the auto, financial services and transport industries. In recent years, German companies have been unhappy about being barred from acquiring most Chinese assets at a time when China\u2019s companies have been on a global buying spree.\n\nThe economic ties make it harder for Merkel to satisfy a U.S. diplomat and activists who have urged her to raise human rights issues such as China\u2019s treatment of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as the three months of pro-democracy demonstrations that have roiled Hong Kong.\n\nRichard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, said Thursday that China\u2019s \u201cwillful disregard of its commitments\u201d to Hong Kong and human rights violations in Xinjiang show that its ruling Communist Party \u201cstands against the values Germany cherishes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope that Chancellor Merkel will take a firm stance for the values that unified Germany after the fall of Communism: human rights, democracy and the rule of law,\u201d he said.\n\nHong Kong activists also warned Merkel about dealing with \u201cauthoritarian and unjust regimes\u201d in an open letter published this week in Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper.\n\nOn the question of what Merkel might say about Hong Kong, a senior German official said the talks with Xi and Li will be conducted \u201ccomprehensively in terms of thematic breadth, and open and friendly in terms of tone \u2014 with a readiness to express criticism where we think things are worthy of criticism.\u201d\n\nThe official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity in line with department rules.\n\nChina has bristled at what it calls foreign interference from countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. on political tumult in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city where activists have staged three months of mass protests calling for democratic reforms and an independent inquiry into police conduct.\n\nOn Friday, Merkel will also visit German engineering company ZF Fredrichshafen in Beijing. She travels Saturday to Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei province, where she will inaugurate the plant expansion at German auto supplier Webasto and speak at Wuhan University.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Angela Merkel said she told Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during talks in Beijing that Hong Kong's rights and freedoms should be safeguarded", "authors": ["Yanan Wang", "Geir Moulson"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hong-kong-merkel.jpeg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
