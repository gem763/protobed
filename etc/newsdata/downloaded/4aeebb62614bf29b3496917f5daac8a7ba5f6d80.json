The question is whether clear market domination prevents startups from even trying.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that state attorneys general will formally launch antitrust investigations into Facebook and Alphabet \u2019s Google beginning this week. The probes are separate from those already ongoing by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission over Google and Facebook, respectively.\n\nIn Facebook\u2019s case, it is difficult to argue that the sheer size of its current user base and resources isn\u2019t affecting competition to some degree. A look at the innovations by U.S. competitor Snap \u2019s Snapchat underscores Facebook\u2019s competitive advantage. In late 2011, Snapchat launched based on the premise of disappearing images meant to be shared among selected friends. This was in stark contrast to the broad and more-permanent disclosure then enabled by Facebook, which has since shifted focus toward more-private conversations. By February 2017, Snap revealed in its IPO filing that it had roughly 158 million daily users. That growth rate was bolstered by the fast uptake of its stories format, which it introduced in 2013.\n\nWhile that may seem impressive in a short period of time, context is everything. In 2016, Facebook introduced a similar stories format on its Instagram platform, later adding it to Facebook\u2019s legacy app. Just eight months after its launch, 200 million people were already using Instagram\u2019s stories daily, according to Statista. That uptake could only be reached by a platform that had already amassed a significantly larger overall user base. This lopsided arms race has continued with both Snapchat and Facebook now offering similar formats for users to watch concentrated shows. Snap, which aired its first original show in 2016, said its first docuseries reached 28 million unique viewers in its first season, nearly 14% of the last reported daily user base. The company hasn\u2019t disclosed how many overall viewers it has across all of its shows. Meanwhile, Facebook in June said that, less than a year after its global launch of Watch, the platform had more than 720 million monthly viewers and 140 million people tuning in daily. Facebook is now reportedly developing a standalone messaging app for Instagram called Threads that looks to include many of Snapchat\u2019s features such as sharing a user\u2019s location with close friends. While it isn\u2019t clear whether the new app will get off the ground, Snap\u2019s stock fell nearly 4% the day the news broke. Facebook\u2019s user base has continued to grow owing in large part to its 2012 acquisition of Instagram, which the company said in June 2018 had more than a billion monthly users. Combined across its platforms, Facebook said in July it now has 2.7 billion monthly users. When a representative at a congressional hearing earlier this year pointed out that Facebook owns four of the top six social networks by active users, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy development denied that its platform is a monopoly. The hearing included testimony from Tim Wu, a Columbia law professor, who said he worried the U.S. is becoming a country where \u201cinventors and entrepreneurs dream of being bought, not of building something of their own.\u201d To be fair, having Facebook breathing down Snap\u2019s neck has hardly proved ruinous. Snapchat in the second quarter reported its largest growth in terms of daily active users in three years, for example. Its stock is up nearly 200% this year, while Facebook is up 43%. Despite recent outperformance, though, Snap has less than 10% of the daily users that Facebook enjoys across its portfolio of apps. It isn\u2019t that newer platforms can\u2019t find success in the face of formidable incumbents today but rather that there may always be a limit to how big and how quickly they can grow. Whether or not that is enough to continue to inspire new innovation remains to be seen.
