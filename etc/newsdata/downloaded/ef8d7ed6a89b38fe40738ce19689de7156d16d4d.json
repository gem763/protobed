Flying direct means you\u2019re less likely to have your bags lost and less likely to get stuck in that random airport where your connection is. While I\u2019ve certainly intentionally picked a more expensive or less convenient flight because it was non-stop I\u2019ve never considered flying to a particular designation just because a non-stop flight was offered, but it\u2019s an idea worth considering.\n\nDirect Flights is a site that shows you all the direct flights that are available from any airport. For my home airport of SFO, for instance, there are 134 direct flights available.\n\nDirect Flights lists all of the direct flights from the airport you chose in a side panel and then allows you to see those potential destinations on a map as well.\n\nImage: Direct Flights\n\nBeside each direct route, you\u2019ll see logos for which airlines offer that route, how many times a week the route is typically run, how long the flight is, and what the lowest price is for it. That price obviously might not be what you\u2019ll pay for the flight for your particular travel dates, but it can give you a good idea of how cheap you can potentially travel to a destination if you have a flexible schedule.\n\nFor instance, there are 273 direct flights a week from San Francisco to Las Vegas starting at $50.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide where to go on your next holiday, the site might be a great way to get a little travel inspiration.", "description": "When it comes to flying, nothing beats a direct flight.
