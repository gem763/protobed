But spaceflight companies had concerns about refueling requirements, so NASA agreed to remove it to increase flexibility and address the more fundamental attribute of sustainability, which is long-term affordability, according to NASA.\n\n\u201cThey were absolutely right,\u201d Lisa Watson-Morgan, NASA's Human Landing System program manager, said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe are operating on a timeline that requires us to be flexible to encourage innovation and alternate approaches.\u201d\n\nHeads up to industry: Our final call for American developed #Artemis landers is here! Kudos to the @NASA team & companies rising to the challenge to return humans to the Moon by 2024. We can\u2019t wait to see your proposals! https://t.co/99Vmw3BMl9 pic.twitter.com/DY5YaqC4vM \u2014 Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) September 30, 2019\n\nAdmittedly, the agency said that developing lunar flight technology for human flight needs takes at least eight years to develop, but the agency only has five years to build a successful vehicle, which is why past requirements are being cut, according to NASA.\n\nNASA has been working in haste to reestablish a human, and American, presence on the moon\u2019s surface to meet deadlines set by the program the Trump Administration. Vice President Pence has warned the agency that if it can\u2019t meet the timeline, the administration will find a company that can.\n\nThe program has been given the name Artemis, in honor of the Greek goddess of the moon. She was the mythical twin of Apollo, the Greek sun god, which was also the name of NASA\u2019s first human lunar exploration program. Artemis has the goal of putting the first woman on the moon, testing technology that will one day send humans to Mars and establishing a permanent human presence on the moon by 2028.\n\nSpace exploration and development companies have just a few weeks to get proposals to NASA for a lunar lander that will take a pair of astronauts from the moon\u2019s orbit to its surface. Proposals are due Nov. 1.\n\nTo maximize our chances of successfully returning to the Moon by 2024, we also are making NASA\u2019s engineering workforce available to contractors and asking proposers to submit a collaboration plan. - Nantel Suzuki, the Human Landing System program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington\n\nThe U.S. space agency announced its final call for proposals earlier this week. The first company to build a lander for the Artemis Program will get the contract for the planned 2024 return to the moon. The company to finish second will get the contract for a 2025 mission to the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nThe tight deadline should not be a problem because companies have been preparing for, reviewing and commenting on several drafts of NASA\u2019s broad agency announcement since July, according to NASA.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cIn order to best accelerate our return to the moon and prepare for Mars, we collaborated with industry on ideas to streamline the procurement process,\u201d Marshall Smith, director of the Human Lunar Exploration Program, said in a prepared statement.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Orion-Space-Shuttle-BT.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
