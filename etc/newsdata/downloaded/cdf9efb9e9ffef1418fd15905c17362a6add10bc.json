Instead, reserve starter Joe Ross took his place on the mound.\n\nScherzer had spasms in his neck and right trap muscle over the past few days. But the condition worsened overnight as the 35-year-old woke up \u201creally hurting,\u201d Martinez said.\n\n\u201cHe was in there with the training staff, getting all kinds of treatment,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cTried to put him \u2014 did all kinds of stuff. And today was just \u2014 he woke up, right away texted (pitching coach) Paul (Menhart) and said that he was really hurting.\n\n\u201cAnd if you all know Max, obviously he pitched with a broken nose, he\u2019s been hurt before, he\u2019s gotten through things. When he comes in and says he\u2019s hurt this bad, he\u2019s hurt.\u201d\n\nMore than an hour later, Scherzer, with a bandage on his neck, addressed reporters \u2014 revealing received a cortisone shot to help with the pain. Scherzer said when he woke up in he could hardly move. The three-time Cy Young winner was in so much pain when he woke up that his wife had to help him get dressed, he added.\n\nScherzer said he was \u201cdisappointed as I could possibly be\u201d that he wasn\u2019t able to pitch.\n\nDoctors told Scherzer that a nerve in his neck is \u201call jammed up,\u201d the pitcher said. He added the cortisone shot should help relieve the pain within 48 hours, possibly making him available for Game 7.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t pick up my arm right now,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cSo I can\u2019t pitch.\u201d\n\nMartinez said he did not know if Scherzer would be available for the rest of the series. The second-year manager said he plans to start Strasburg on Tuesday for Game 6.\n\nThe Nationals planned for Scherzer to help them in a critical game with the series tied at 2. Washington has dropped two consecutive games, seeing starters An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and Patrick Corbin struggle against the Astros\u2019 lineup. Entering Sunday, the Nationals were 8-0 in the postseason with Scherzer or Stephen Strasburg starting \u2014 and 2-4 without.\n\nFor Game 5, the Nationals will rely on Joe Ross, a right-handed pitcher who floated between the bullpen and starting throughout the regular season. In 27 appearances \u2014 nine of which were starts \u2014 the 26-year-old went 4-4 with a career-high 5.48 ERA. He pitched 64 innings, giving up 74 hits and 39 earned runs.\n\nTwo years ago, Ross established himself as Washington\u2019s fifth starter. But in July, he was shut down with elbow pain and underwent Tommy John surgery.\n\nRoss appeared in two innings in Game 3, throwing 19 pitches in the 4-1 loss.\n\n\u201cI trust his ability to prepare,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing that having some of the struggles early on in the year with him, he really took another step as far as like preparation, doing his homework, and you just take notice of those things. That\u2019s his own journey.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals don\u2019t believe Scherzer\u2019s injury is related to the 35-year-old\u2019s back injury that landed him on the injured list twice in July. Scherzer missed a month with the injury, returning on Aug. 22 against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nIn his eight regular-season starts after the back injury, Scherzer worked through rust. He was less sharp than normal, accruing a 4.74 ERA. But he recovered in time for the playoffs \u2014 and has been stellar in the postseason.\n\nIn five games, Scherzer posted a 2.16 ERA. He even came out of the bullpen in Game 2 of the NLDS, preserving an inning en route to Washington\u2019s win. Asked Saturday about his back, Scherzer told reporters the issues were behind him.\n\nBut now, the Nationals will anxiously wait to see if Scherzer can recover.\n\n\u201cIt really hurt to get out of bed,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cI had to just basically fall out of bed and pick myself up with my left arm and I was moving around, just couldn\u2019t even move my arm. I just knew at that point I was in a really bad spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really upset about it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen \u2014 believe me, I\u2019ve never seen Max this quiet. He\u2019s very quiet.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
