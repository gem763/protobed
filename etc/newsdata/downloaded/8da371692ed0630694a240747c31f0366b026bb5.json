(AP) - A Louisville dance team member will have to visit a specialist to repair a broken nose she sustained when she was hit by an errant pass thrown by Notre Dame\u2019s Ian Book.\n\nElizabeth Scott was hit in the fourth quarter of the eighth-ranked Irish\u2019s 35-17 victory over the Cardinals on Monday night. Book, under pressure, threw the ball out of bounds and struck Scott as she performed with other dancers near Cardinal Stadium\u2019s south end zone.\n\nSheryl Knight, the coach of the Ladybirds dance squad, said in a statement Tuesday that Scott is seeing a specialist because of the break\u2019s complicated nature. Knight added that added that Scott\u2019s pain is \u201cmanageable\u201d and she is anxious to return to the sideline.\n\nThe dental hygiene major from Floyds Knobs, Indiana, joked on her verified Twitter account about her injury trending on social media. Scott even thanked Book.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Louisville dance team member will have to visit a specialist to repair a broken nose she sustained when she was hit by an errant pass thrown by Notre Dame's Ian Book.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
