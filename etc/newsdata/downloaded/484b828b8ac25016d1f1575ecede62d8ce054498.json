Page writers kept disagreeing whether the people were protesters or rioters.\n\nHundreds of recently uncovered Chinese edits to Taiwan's Wikipedia page have revealed the country's attempts to claim ownership of the state\n\nAnd while the English entry about the Senkaku islands claimed they were 'islands in East Asia', the Mandarin equivalent was edited to include 'China's inherent territory'.\n\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, which Amnesty International estimates had a death toll of 1,000, were changed in Mandarin to 'the June 4th incident' to 'quell the counter-revolutionary riots'.\n\nThe pro-democracy protests began on April 15, 1989, but were forcibly stopped when the government declared martial law and sent the military in, in an event sometimes referred to as the Tiananmen Square Massacre.\n\nThe massacre saw the military occupy central parts of Beijing and troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at demonstrators.\n\nThe Wikipedia page for the Hong Kong protests was changed 65 times in one day. Page writers kept disagreeing whether the people were protesters or rioters\n\nEstimates of the death toll vary from several hundreds to several thousands.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is described as a Tibetan refugee on the Wikipedia's English entry page whereas in Mandarin, he is a Chinese exile.\n\nJamie Lin, a board member of Wikimedia Taiwan, believes what was once an incredible font of knowledge for the masses, is under attack.\n\nShe told the BBC: 'It's control by the Chinese Government. That's very terrible.'\n\nA BBC Click investigation found almost 1,600 biased edits across 22 politically sensitive articles but it wasn't able to find who made each of them.\n\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, which Amnesty International estimates had a death toll of 1,000, were changed in Mandarin to 'the June 4th incident' to 'quell the counter-revolutionary riots'\n\nSome academics argue that because of foreign media, Wikipedia entries have a large number of prejudiced words against the Chinese government.\n\nAcademics Li-hao Gan and Bin-Ting Weng said: 'China urgently needs to encourage and train Chinese netizens to become Wikipedia platform opinion leaders and administrators\u2026 who can adhere to socialist values and form some core editorial teams.'\n\nAnd a new concept of 'telling China's story' has gained traction over the past couple of years.\n\nSome Taiwanese Wikipedians have reported receiving death threats on the Wikimedia Telegram Channel.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is described as a Tibetan refugee on the Wikipedia's English entry page whereas in Mandarin, he is a Chinese exile\n\nOne read: 'The policemen will enjoy your mother's forensic report.'\n\nChina is known for systematically manipulating online social media on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nSo Heather Ford, a senior lecturer in digital cultures at the University of New South Wales, whose research has focused on the political editing of Wikipedia wasn't surprised that the country is now targeting Wikipedia.\n\nShe said: 'I'm surprised it's taken this long actually\u2026 It is a prioritised source of facts and knowledge about the world.'", "description": "The description of Taiwan changes from a 'state in East Asia' to a 'province in the People's Republic of China'.
