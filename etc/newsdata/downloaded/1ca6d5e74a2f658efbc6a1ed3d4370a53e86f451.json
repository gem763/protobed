another volley hit the tape, and one drop shot too many fell short, that chance evaporated.\n\nEvery service game was a trial for Berrettini, who saved more break points in the first and third games of the second set but succumbed to trail 5-3.\n\nTwo sets to the good, Nadal disappeared into the distance and a 7-6 (6) 6-4 6-1 victory was wrapped up in two hours and 35 minutes.\n\nThe 33-year-old will move to within one major title of Roger Federer\u2019s record tally of 20 if he can overcome Medvedev.\n\nNadal said: \u201cFirst set was a little bit frustrating, I had a lot of break points and you don\u2019t want to be in a tie-break with a player like Matteo.\n\n\u201cIn the tie-break I was a bit lucky but I survived. Finally I had a break in the second and the match completely changed. I\u2019m super happy to be back in the final of the US Open.\n\n\u201cCongrats to Matteo. He\u2019s young, he has everything and he has a great future in front of him.\n\n\u201cDaniil is one of the most solid players on the tour, he\u2019s making steps every week and he had an amazing summer. He will be the toughest opponent and I will need to play my best.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Medvedev secured a place in his first grand slam final and won over a hostile crowd in the process\n\nThe hot-headed Russian, who has defiantly blasted his way through the draw to a backdrop of jeers from the stands, overcame Grigor Dimitrov.\n\nMedvedev became the villain of the piece in the third round when he snatched a towel from a ballboy and then gave the crowd the middle finger, before goading them in his post-match interviews throughout the fortnight.\n\nBut after beating Dimitrov in straight sets to make Sunday\u2019s showpiece, the 23-year-old declared: \u201cI love the USA!\u201d\n\nDimitrov, who knocked out Roger Federer, will wonder how he lost the opening set, while the second set featured some of the most compelling tennis of the championships.\n\nMedvedev took that one too and went on win 7-6 (5) 6-4 6-3 victory in two hours and 38 minutes.\n\n\u201cThe tournament of controversies,\u201d he smiled afterwards. \u201cFinally I\u2019m here after three sets. I\u2019m just happy to be in the final.\n\n\u201cWhen I was going to the USA, I didn\u2019t know it would be this good. I have to say I love the USA!\n\n\u201cI want to be a better person than I was a few days here.\u201d", "description": "Rafael Nadal blew away Matteo Berrettini to reach the US Open final and to the brink of a 19th grand slam title.
