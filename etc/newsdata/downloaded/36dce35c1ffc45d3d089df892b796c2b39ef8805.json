The coalition faces another vote of confidence in the senate on Tuesday, which it is also expected to win.\n\nLeague leader Matteo Salvini pulled the plug on his party's governing coalition \u2014 also led by Conte \u2014 with the 5Stars in August, hoping to trigger a snap election given his lead in the polls. Yet the move backfired when the 5Stars and the PD agreed to form a new government under Conte, sidelining the League.\n\n\"The EU needs to improve its policies and [it] needs better economic and fiscal governance\" \u2014 Giuseppe Conte\n\nIn his speech, Conte set out an agenda with a strong EU focus, signaling Italy would turn over a new leaf under the new government after the League-5Stars coalition spent much of its year in office at odds with Brussels over budget issues and migration.\n\nBut he also called on the incoming Commission of Ursula von der Leyen to amend key EU fiscal rules and rules on distributing asylum seekers within the bloc. \"The EU needs to improve its policies and [it] needs better economic and fiscal governance,\" he said.\n\nThe prime minister also outlined the new government's plans for environmentally friendly policies and support for young families, workers and savers.\n\nMeanwhile, outside parliament, Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, led a rally to protest against the new coalition government. Streets in the center of Rome were filled with people trying to reach the square and traffic was jammed throughout the city.", "description": "Giuseppe Conte pledges good relations with Brussels under new coalition.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Stephen Brown", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165944594-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
