In fact, I thought he might go a bit sooner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut he\u2019s got some very big plans. He\u2019s going to be very successful. We have his successor. We\u2019ll announce it pretty soon.\u201d\n\nDeputy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who has attended several international energy meetings in recent months, is widely expected to replace Perry. The Energy Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPerry, 69, who was the longest-serving governor of Texas and faced off against Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential nominating contests, said earlier this month he had no plans to step down, denying a media report that he was expected to announce his resignation in November.\n\nIn recent weeks, he has found himself engulfed in the impeachment investigation threatening Trump\u2019s presidency. Three Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives committees issued a subpoena on Oct. 10 for Perry to turn over documents on any role he played in Trump\u2019s bid to get Ukraine to investigate a political rival.\n\nThe probe focuses on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 call to investigate his unsubstantiated allegation that former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, improperly tried to aid his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in Ukraine.\n\nWhite House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said earlier on Thursday that Trump had directed Perry to work on Ukraine policy with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nCritics have accused Giuliani, who was not a U.S. government official, of conducting a shadow Ukraine policy.\n\nIn a visit to Ukraine for Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration in May, Perry had recommended that he talk about energy reforms with two Texas businessmen Michael Bleyzer, a Ukrainian-American, and Robert Bensh, a frequent visitor to Ukraine, as well as unnamed Energy Department experts, a department official said earlier this month.\n\nThe Associated Press reported at the time that an unnamed source said Perry had pushed for Bleyzer to be put on the board of Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state oil and gas company, after meeting with Ukrainian officials during his visit.\n\nBefore Zelenskiy was president, Perry helped seal a deal to sell U.S. coal to Ukraine and had worked with the country and others on providing Europe an alternative to its dependence on gas from Russia. Perry talked up shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas, a booming industry, as \u201cfreedom gas\u201d for Eastern Europe.\n\nPerry was virtually free of the ethics investigations that weighed on other Trump administration officials. He has been a champion of U.S. oil and gas production and the nuclear industry, but failed to achieve a goal of subsidizing aging U.S. coal and reactors facing a rash of closures.\n\nTOUGH ON IRAN, FRIEND TO SAUDI ARABIA\n\nPerry has tried to persuade Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, to build nuclear power plants using U.S. technology.\n\nHe often met Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, a fellow alumnus of Texas A&M University, about the kingdom\u2019s plans to build its first two commercial nuclear power plants. In September, Saudi Arabia\u2019s king replaced Falih with his son, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, whom Perry had met before.\n\nThe Trump administration kept the civilian nuclear talks quiet, a source of friction with Democrats in Congress who wanted to ensure that the kingdom would agree to strict nonproliferation standards.\n\nThe Energy Department issued seven licenses to companies to share sensitive information on nuclear power with Riyadh, including two that were issued after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry speaks during a news conference after the Partnership for Transatlantic Energy Cooperation conference in Vilnius, Lithuania October 7, 2019.

In 2018, Trump pressed Saudi Arabia to boost oil exports ahead of his administration\u2019s unilateral reimposition of sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports.\n\nFalih explained to Perry then that global demand was not strong enough to justify a big boost in output and depended on Perry to explain that to Trump to reduce pressure on the kingdom.", "description": "U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry will step down by the end of the year, President Donald Trump said on Thursday, a day before a deadline set by congressional Democrats for Perry to turn over documents in the impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442020484&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G21O", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
