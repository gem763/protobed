There's one with a (marginally) better plan", "language": "en", "text": "Good Morning!\n\nThe polls are truly capturing our mass disappointment with our available choices. CBC\u2019s latest poll of polls shows Canadians are equally mistrusting of the two leading parties (Liberals at 32 per cent, Conservatives at 31.6 per cent), are somewhat concerned about income inequality (NDP at 18.4 per cent) and the environment (Greens at 7.5 per cent). Voters also have a soft spot for regionalism (Bloc at 7 per cent) and are nursing a bout of nativism (PPC at 2.5 per cent).\n\nGiven Canadian indecision, we will likely have a minority government, but CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld believes neither major political party, if elected, will rock the boat \u2014 especially in comparison to countries like the United States and the United Kingdom where the main political parties are poles apart on key issues.\n\n\u201cIn like some of those chaotic situations seen abroad, to put a twist on Lincoln, a Canadian House divided against itself can indeed stand. \u201cThe upshot for investors is that with less drama in a minority outcome than elsewhere, don\u2019t expect a huge market reaction when the results are announced.\u201d\n\nStill, there might be some differences among the two parties. Oxford Economics says a Conservative government would have a limited impact on the overall economy as lower income taxes would be offset by reduced government outlays.\n\n\u201cWe would expect no change to our baseline growth forecast of 1.1 per cent in 2020 and 1.4 per cent in 2021,\u201d according to Tony Stillo, a director with Oxford.\n\nThe Liberal plan, on the other hand, would likely boost growth by 0.1 percentage point in 2020 and 0.2 percentage points in 2021 via deficit-financed tax cuts and transfers to households. \u201cThis would boost our call for GDP growth to 1.2 per cent in 2020 and 1.6 per cent in 2021 although the Bank of Canada might be tempted to maintain tighter monetary policy,\u201d Stillo said.\n\nKeep an eye out on the loonie, too. The Canadian currency now stands as the strongest major currency in the world in 2019, rising 3.8 per cent year-to-date against the U.S. dollar, with its NAFTA partner Mexican peso next in line up 2.7 per cent this year.\n\nBMO Capital Markets notes loonie\u2019s strength is surprising, giving the rising uncertainty ahead of the elections taking place today, with most polls pointing to some kind of of a two-way or even three-way coalition.\n\n\u201cWhile Canada does have plenty of experience with minority governments (including three different versions from 2004 through 2011), a three-party dynamic is new,\u201d said Douglas Porter, BMO\u2019s chief economist. \u201cAs well, while there isn\u2019t a huge gap in the overall proposed thrust of fiscal policy, details differ widely, especially when considering some of the proposals of other parties\u2014with potentially big implications for the energy sector at the very least. Suffice it to say, the preternatural calm of the Canadian dollar during the campaign is a surprise.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know this morning:\n\nCanada\u2019s 43rd federal election\n\nCorporate Earnings: West Fraser Timber Co Ltd, Bear Creek Mining Corp and Thunderbird Entertainment Group, Amazon.com and Microsoft Inc.\n\n\n\nWho was a better steward of the Canadian economy? Stephen Harper adroitly handled the Canadian economy from the world\u2019s worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, while Justin Trudeau has presided at a time when the United States was taken over by one of the most unpredictable and disruptive administrations.\n\nWhile Trudeau hasn\u2019t been able to beat Harper\u2019s 3.2 per cent GDP growth of 2010, unemployment has fallen dramatically during the Liberals reign. Gross national income per capita surged under Harper but has fallen under Trudeau due to rising population growth.\n\nSo, which PM faced greater economic headwinds?\n\n\u201cThis is difficult to compare,\u201d says Pedro Antunes, chief economist at Conference Board of Canada. \u201cDuring the Trudeau years, the U.S. administration\u2019s push to dismantle NAFTA and the recent trade pressures from China have certainly been a challenge for exporters and private investment. Moreover, the economy was challenged by the steep decline in oil prices in 2015.\u201d\n\nWould the Conservative have handled the Canadian economy better in the past four years, given the external forces impacting the economy?\n\n\u201cI would agree that governments can only do so much,\u201d Antunes told the Financial Post in an email. \u201cTrudeau did raise benefits to households and government spending has expanded. This stimulated domestic demand but export growth has been muted. Still, employment growth is doing well, the unemployment rate has dropped to record lows and service sectors are posting solid gains.\u201d\n\nBoth Harper and Trudeau failed to focus on tax reform during their terms, which is an important issue for Canada as we\u2019re no longer competitive in comparison to the U.S. \u201cand this has been problematic for private investment,\u201d Antunes concludes.\n\n\u2014 Please send your news, comments and stories to yhussain@postmedia.com. \u2014\n\nYadullah Hussain @yad_Fpenergy\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg", "description": "Stuff you need to know", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canadavote.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
