Volkswagen and Ford are having to collaborate on research and development, similarly Jaguar Land Rover and BMW. You need really big scale to recoup the cost of R&D.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nDyson, best known in the UK for inventing a bagless vacuum cleaner, revealed draft designs for the car earlier this year, publishing plans he said were \u201cdeliberately light on specifics\u201d.\n\nBailey said patents filed during the car\u2019s development could now be sold off to automotive companies working on developing their own battery-powered cars.\n\n\u201cYou had to wonder if they had such fantastic technology why they didn\u2019t just licence it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat might now be a feasible path.\u201d", "description": "Billionaire Brexiter tells staff in email that project not commercially viable", "authors": ["Rob Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6f75daac40f8bd040aefcc233a9e070d0065eb3/0_81_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=245297c778686087faaf9cc9dc5dccb1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
