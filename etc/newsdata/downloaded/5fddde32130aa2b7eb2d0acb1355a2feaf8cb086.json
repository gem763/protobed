A recruitment drive for British space explorers is a rare event\n\nA recruitment drive for British space explorers is a rare event.\n\nSince the European Space Agency (ESA) was created in 1975, there have been only three astronaut selection campaigns.\n\nThe first was in 1978-79, the second in 1991-1992 and the most recent in 2008-2009, when Britain's first ESA astronaut Major Tim Peake was accepted.\n\nWould-be applicants will ideally be aged 27-37, have a masters degree in science, medicine or engineering and 'experience as a pilot is a plus'.\n\nThe agency advises that ideal candidates fall between 5ft and 6ft 2ins.\n\nAnd being able to speak Russian is a bonus \u2013 as the rocket trip to the ISS is aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft commanded by a Russian citizen.\n\nBut competition is tough \u2013 10,000 people applied in the last round of selection. And hot-headed characters need not apply.\n\nThe ESA warns: 'It is a challenge to live in a confined space for long periods with other people.\n\nSince the European Space Agency (ESA) was created in 1975, there have been only three astronaut selection campaigns. The first was in 1978-79, the second in 1991-1992 and the most recent in 2008-2009, when Britain's first ESA astronaut Major Tim Peake was accepted\n\n'Would-be astronauts also need self-control and an equable temperament to cope with stress and any emergency that may arise.'\n\nWith that in mind, rigorous psychological testing of memory, multi-tasking ability and hand-eye coordination is carried out. Major Peake was selected in 2013 to board the ISS. But while he served in the Army Air Corps, it is not necessary to have military experience.\n\nGood eyesight is required, but wearing glasses need not be a hindrance as long as the eyesight is not deteriorating.\n\nAnd being an astronaut is still a select club \u2013 with only around 550 people having gone into space.\n\nLearning Russian is considered a major hurdle to overcome. Denmark's first astronaut, Andreas Mogensen, once said that learning Russian was his biggest challenge.\n\nAnd if you don't speak it, it might be wise to start learning as it could take around 1,100 hours to become reasonably fluent. Public speaking is also important as astronauts are 'often in the spotlight', ESA warns.\n\nA UK Space Agency spokesman said: 'Tim Peake is a member of the European Space Agency Astronaut Corps and there could be a search for additional astronauts starting as early as next year.\n\n'So if you think you have what it takes, get ready.'", "description": "Would-be applicants for the UK Space Agency will ideally be aged 27-37, have a masters degree in science, medicine or engineering and 'experience as a pilot is a plus'.", "authors": ["Colin Fernandez Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/28/00/19029298-0-image-a-68_1569626052501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
