And he began by asking about a specific line from her massive rally the night before in New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared,\u201d Warren told the crowd of 20,000. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else. And Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared and looking backward.\u201d\n\nAsked by the host if that was a \u201cveiled shot\u201d at her 2020 rival Joe Biden, Warren said, \u201cNo, the way I see this, is these really are scary times. It\u2019s scary times because Donald Trump is truly a terrible president. Not just bad, terrible.\u201d\n\nColbert pushed further on this point though, saying, \u201cPeople are seeing you refer to Biden in that because when things do get scary\u2014and it is a scary time\u2014people run to the familiar, they run to the safe, they run to the comfortable,\u201d all things that the former vice president seems to represent for voters. \u201cHow do you make yourself familiar and comfortable to these people?\u201d the host asked.\n\n\u201cSo I guess I just don\u2019t see it the same way, Stephen,\u201d Warren replied. \u201cI see this as either, you know, we can hide under the covers, or we can say, no, we get it. The government isn\u2019t working for us. Donald Trump is in charge, but things have been broken for a very long time. And instead of hiding, we can actually come together, all of us, fight back and make this the country we want it to be. For me, this is about looking forward.\u201d\n\nThe crowd sounded impressed.\n\nLater in their conversation, Colbert attempted to corner Warren into admitting that taxes will have to go up for middle-class households in order to pay for her Medicare-for-All plan. As she kept referring to overall \u201ccosts\u201d and saying, \u201chere\u2019s the thing,\u201d he interrupted her to say, \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve listened to these answers a few times before and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you\u2019re not mentioning in your sentence: Isn\u2019t Medicare-for-All like public school?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren\u2019t educated?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cDo you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that\u2019s Medicare-for-All. Everyone gets covered,\u201d Warren said. She proceeded to make her pitch for why her plan is better than keeping private insurance companies, declaring \u201cthose who have more will pay more\u201d and \u201chardworking families will pay less,\u201d but did not give a straight answer on middle-class tax increases.\n\nColbert ended the interview by asking Warren if she agrees with President Trump on anything. After a long pause, she replied, \u201cYes! Yes! He signed my bill into law that is going to bring down the cost of hearing aids for millions of people across this country. I\u2019m in.
