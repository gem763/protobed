Before the group trip, she had visited both as a volunteer and to produce a segment for \"Full Frontal\" about asylum seekers. (The show on TBS, which like CNN, is owned by parent company WarnerMedia.)\n\nShe decided to go back after a haunting photo showing a dead man and child in waters along the border made headlines in June.\n\n\"I was getting a lot of private messages from people [because] they know I'm passionate about immigration,\" she said. \"Everybody was sort of contacting me saying, 'What can I do? I need to do something.' And after answering a bunch of separate messages, I just said, 'You know, I'm going to put a trip together if you go and help out at the border.'\"\n\n\"Being in New York, I just felt so removed from all of it and from everything that was happening,\" Colin Jakubczyk, a former \"Full Frontal\" staffer who'd never been to the Rio Grande Valley, told CNN. \"Trying to understand what was really happening and what it's really like was one of the main motivations for wanting to go down there.\"\n\nLast night we fed 500 asylum seekers on the Texas/Matamoros border. People wait their turn to plea for asylum, sleeping in tents in 104 degrees. They could easily be waiting with their families in the US if not for Trump's Remain in Mexico policy. We have to do better than this. pic.twitter.com/DhfsQWAPi5 \u2014 Ana Bret\u00f3n (@missbreton) August 20, 2019\n\nAt the shelter, they handed out toiletries, organized donations and helped entertain and comfort children.\n\nBut during their trip, the flow of people seeking help ceased as the Migrant Protection Protocols, informally known as the \" Remain in Mexico\" policy , went into effect. The policy requires some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their hearing. It led to at times empty shelters on the US side, several of the volunteers observed, during their trip.\n\n\"It was so depressing that there weren't more people, knowing that they were somewhere else that wasn't a positive place for them,\" said Cassidy Routh, who does graphics at \"Full Frontal.\"\n\nRealizing their efforts might be needed on the other side of the border, a group headed for the tent camps located in Matamoros, just south of Brownsville, to hand out 300 lunch bags they made. They encountered, Bret\u00f3n estimated, about 500 people.\n\n\"The energy there versus the energy at the center was just so different,\" Jakubczyk said. \"There was so much more uncertainty there and so much more desperation and you could really see all that.\"\n\nSummers in Texas frequently top the triple digits, even in the shade. At the tent camps, Jakubczyk said, many people had no cover from the sun. At the centers, they would have had air condition, access to showers, legal guidance, clothing and food, he added.\n\n\"All those people there, I just wanted them in the shelter. I wish they had been in the shelter,\" he said.\n\nEmotionally, the volunteers said going back to their lives in New York was hard because there was a sense of powerlessness and a desire to do more. However, Jakubczyk said Bret\u00f3n kept people in \"a positive place by talking about how the things we can still do after we leave.\"\n\nThe upcoming comedy show, which includes a lineup comprised of people who went on the trip and other comedians, is just the latest example of Bret\u00f3n delivering on her vow find more opportunities for the volunteers and her network to help.\n\nThis one came together because someone from Caveat, where the show is being held, had seen information about their efforts at the border online and asked if they were interested in doing a fundraising show, Bret\u00f3n said.\n\n\"I think there are a lot of really great people out there that we're lucky to know that are taking action, like Ana and our show,\" said \"Full Frontal\" associate producer Rachel Moss, who went on the trip. \"We do a lot of really great things that I'm proud of that are more than just yelling into the void.\"\n\nBret\u00f3n added: \"Working on this show has turned on myself -- along with a lot of people that I know that work on the show -- into really empowered activists, which has been really special.\"", "description": "Some late-night TV staffers are hoping some laughter will bring much-needed resources to those helping on the front lines of the humanitarian crisis at the Texas-Mexico border.", "authors": ["Sandra Gonzalez"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190912123244-full-frontal-staffers-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
