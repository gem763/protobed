REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo\n\nSingapore - which is due to hold an election within months - has like other trade-reliant Asian economies been hit hard by the escalating U.S.-China trade war and a broader global slowdown.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) manages policy through exchange rate settings, rather than through interest rates as other central banks do, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed policy band.\n\nMAS said it would \u201creduce slightly\u201d the slope of the Singapore dollar\u2019s policy band, using wording that suggested a shallower easing than some had expected. The width and level at which the band was centered was unchanged.\n\nThe Singapore dollar SGD= rose slightly against the U.S. dollar on the day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slight reduction in the rate of appreciation. They did not say the policy was neutral so it suggests that the slope is still positive,\u201d said Barclays economist Brian Tan.\n\nEleven economists polled by Reuters had all expected Singapore to ease - its first such move since April 2016.\n\nSingapore\u2019s economy grew less than expected in the third quarter but avoided slipping into a technical recession, flash data showed on Monday.\n\nMAS increased the slope of the policy band twice last year in efforts to control rising price pressures and strengthen its currency, in its first such tightening moves in six years.\n\nBut a prolonged tariff dispute between the United States and China - two of Singapore\u2019s biggest export markets - has disrupted global supply chains in many trade-reliant economies, including the city state.\n\nManufacturing has been hit particularly hard, buffeted by the trade tensions and a cyclical downturn in the electronics sector.\n\nThe Singapore government is expected to roll out a generous budget next year as polls loom and the ruling party seeks to appease voters who are feeling the pinch from the economic downturn.\n\nMAS expects full-year growth to come in around the mid-point of its 0-1% forecast range, and to \u201cimprove modestly\u201d in 2020. However, economists see room for further easing next year.\n\n\u201cThey (MAS) decided to be gradual instead of pre-emptive,\u201d said Jeff Ng, Continuum Economics\u2019 chief economist for Asia.\n\n\u201cIf the trend of slower growth continues in 2020, it may still well be that they continue to ease into 2020.\u201d", "description": "Singapore's central bank eased monetary policy for the first time in three years on Monday, as widely expected, with the city-state's bellwether economy narrowly dodging recession.", "authors": ["John Geddie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440568673&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D05G", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
