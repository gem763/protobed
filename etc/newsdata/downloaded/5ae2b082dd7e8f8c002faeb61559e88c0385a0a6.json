No Americans were hurt. Esper said it was unclear whether that was an accident.\n\nTrump, in a tweet, said: \u201cVery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Esper said the U.S. also has come to believe that the Kurds are attempting to \u201ccut a deal\u201d with the Syrian army and Russia to counter the invading Turks.\n\nShortly afterward, Kurdish officials announced they will work with the Syrian government to fend off the Turkish invasion, deploying side by side along the border. Syrian TV said government troops were moving to the north to confront the Turkish invasion but gave no details.\n\nA Syrian Kurdish official and a war monitor also said Syrian government forces were poised to enter Kurdish-controlled towns from which U.S. troops are pulling out, following a deal reached through Russia.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the deal covered the towns of Kobani and Manbij. U.S. troops were deployed in the towns after they were cleared of Islamic State militants in 2015.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters had few options after the United States abandoned them, and it had been anticipated they would turn to the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad and its Russian allies for support.\n\nThe Syrian troop movements raise the risk of a clash between Syria and Turkey.\n\nIn addition, a return by Assad\u2019s forces to the region where Syrian Kurds have built up an autonomy in the north would be a major shift in Syria\u2019s long-running civil war, further cementing Assad\u2019s hold over the war-ravaged country.\n\nIt would also mean that U.S. troops no longer have presence in an area where Russia and Iranian-backed militias now have a role.\n\nTurkey\u2019s official Anadolu news agency, meanwhile, said Turkey-backed Syrian forces have advanced into the center of a Syrian border town, Tal Abyad, on the fifth day of Turkey\u2019s offensive. Turkey\u2019s Defense Ministry tweeted that its forces had taken control of the main highway running between Hassakeh, a major town and logistics hub, and Ein Eissa, the administrative center of the Kurdish-held areas.\n\nCasualties mounted. On Sunday, at least nine people, including five civilians, were killed in Turkish airstrikes on a convoy in the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ayn, according to the Observatory and Syrian Kurdish officials.\n\nImages of the attack showed bodies and severed limbs strewn in the street. Some of those killed appeared to be carrying guns. Activists said the gunmen were guarding the convoy.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday ruled out any mediation in the dispute with the Kurds, saying Turkey won\u2019t negotiate with \u201cterrorists.\u201d NATO member Turkey views the Syrian Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to the Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nThe fighting has raised fears that some of the thousands of Islamic State members and sympathizers held by the Kurds will escape or be released in the chaos, allowing the battered extremist group to make a comeback and sow terror at will.\n\nOn Sunday, heavy fighting reached a displaced-persons camp in Ein Eissa, some 35 kilometers (20 miles) south of the border, that is home to some 12,000 people, including around 1,000 wives and widows of Islamic State fighters and their children, held in a special detention area.\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria said in a statement that 950 IS supporters escaped after attacking guards and storming the gates. It was not immediately possible to confirm that figure.\n\n\u201cIt gets worse by the hour,\u201d Esper said of the fighting. \u201cThese are all the exact things\u201d that U.S. officials warned Erdogan would probably happen in urging him not to invade.\n\nThe United Nations said more than 130,000 Syrians have fled since the operation began last week. Turkey said 440 Kurdish fighters have been killed since the operation began Wednesday. The SDF said 56 of its fighters have died. Turkey also said four of its soldiers were killed, along with 16 allied Syrian fighters.\n\n___\n\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut.
