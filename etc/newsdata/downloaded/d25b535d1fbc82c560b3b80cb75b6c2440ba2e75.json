It wouldn\u2019t be Johnson and his wealthy friends. It\u2019s not their livelihoods on the line. It would be the rest of us,\u201d Corbyn will say according to excerpts of his speech released by his office.\n\n\u201cFor the Tories (Conservatives) this is about so much more than leaving the European Union. It\u2019s about hijacking the referendum result to shift even more power and wealth to those at the top.\u201d\n\nWhile many in parliament fear the impact of a no-deal Brexit, Johnson and his team say they have boosted preparations for such an outcome to try to minimise the fall-out from Britain leaving without a deal.\n\nBut with the future of Brexit still in the balance, Britain looks to be heading towards an election, with both Labour and Johnson\u2019s Conservatives stepping up preparations for a poll and both sides targeting each other at every opportunity.\n\nCorbyn will again repeat Labour\u2019s stance to first \u201cstop no deal, and then trigger a general election\u201d, explaining that he had not backed Johnson\u2019s request for an early poll because \u201cno one can trust\u201d his word.\n\n\u201cSo a general election is coming. But we won\u2019t allow Johnson to dictate the terms,\u201d he will say. \u201cAnd I can tell you this: we\u2019re ready for that election. We\u2019re ready to unleash the biggest people-powered campaign we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d", "description": "Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will accuse Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday of hijacking Brexit to lead Britain out of the European Union without a deal and shift power and wealth \"to those at the top\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428093498&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881VE", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
