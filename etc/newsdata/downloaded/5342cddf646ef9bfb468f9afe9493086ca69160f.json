Toxic work culture flourishes when companies don\u2019t address worker disagreements, SHRM says. And politics can surely spawn disagreement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s leader to \u201clook into\u201d Democratic rival Joe Biden and other gripes the president had relating to the 2016 presidential election, according to a transcript of a phone call made to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u2018The division we already have in the workplace now has been multiplied.\u2019 \u2014Society for Human Resource Management President and CEO Johnny Taylor Jr.\n\nThis week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched an official impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\n\u201cThe division we already have in the workplace now has been multiplied,\u201d SHRM President and CEO Johnny Taylor Jr. said Wednesday, speaking a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nMounting political polarization is forcing HR managers to venture into new territory and affecting employees\u2019 ability to do their jobs.\n\n\u201cWe have to manage that [political division] at work, and in the past, HR would never do that. We\u2019d just say \u2018don\u2019t talk about that at work.\u2019 They\u2019re talking about it. Who isn\u2019t talking about it? We\u2019ve got to figure that out,\u201d Taylor told MarketWatch. He says managers should bring workers together and let them discuss the issues, but with clear rules about being respectful and civil.\n\nA survey last year from the staffing company Robert Half International RHI, +0.11% found 22% of workers got into a \u201cheated discussion with a co-worker\u201d during the last presidential election. Another 15% said their productivity slipped because of the water cooler political talk.\n\nOne HR hotline has already received 60,000 calls this year on how to handle politics in the workplace.\n\nMore human resource professionals are grappling with how to handle workers who talk politics on the job. It may be a politically fraught time, but it\u2019s also an extremely tight job market where many companies are working hard to ensure workers don\u2019t leave for another position.\n\nThe SHRM hotline already received 60,000 queries this year on how to handle politics in the workplace, said Alexander Alonso, the professional association\u2019s chief knowledge officer. That\u2019s 10% of the 600,000 hot line calls it receives in a year. In 2016, it received 30,000 calls about handling the hot button topic, he said.\n\nIn fact, the hot line gets more questions on politics than it does about sexual harassment, even as the #MeToo movement gained steam. The hot line received 6,000 calls (1% of all calls) surrounding sexual-harassment issues in 2016 and now it receives around 2,400 calls (4% of all calls) on the matter, Alonso said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: In the #MeToo era, 60% of male managers say they\u2019re scared of being alone with women at work\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like nothing we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Taylor said of the sharp uptick in calls over politics. \u201cThe level of toxicity in the environment is at an all-time high,\u201d he added.\n\nFederal and state laws let workers discuss job conditions, practices and pay while they\u2019re at work. Yet there are very few laws protecting employees from being punished for talking about politics, especially private sector workers, according to Workplace Fairness, an employee advocacy organization.\n\nSee also: Think twice before talking about Trump at work\u2014it could hurt your chances of promotion\n\nBroader political disagreements can sometimes bleed into workplace complaints. For example, the National Labor Relations Board recently settled a case with Google, saying the company had to post notices about worker rights to talk about pay and safety conditions.\n\nA former employee, Kevin Cernekee, filed the complaint. He alleged he was fired from Google GOOG, -0.74% for his conservative-leaning comments on a company chat forum. The company previously said it terminated him for allegedly downloading secret company documents to a personal device.\n\nThe NLRB settlement does not discuss political activity, a spokesperson for Google GOOGL, -0.77% told MarketWatch. The tech giant\u2019s employee guidelines state, \u201cwhile sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community, disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not.\u201d", "description": "The Society for Human Resource Management\u2019s CEO Johnny Taylor Jr. tells MarketWatch that companies should brace for a higher turnover in this heated...", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS082_impeac_ZG_20190925212527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
