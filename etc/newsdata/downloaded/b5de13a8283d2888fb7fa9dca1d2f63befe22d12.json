So, we\u2019ve got really good players, we need more than three.\n\nJadon Sancho (left) and Marcus Rashford are competing for a berth alongside Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling (Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that in tournaments that I played in, we always pinned our hopes on one player or two players.\n\n\u201cThen there was an injury, a drama and a crisis and you need players to be able to start games and you need players who are able to come on and make a difference in games.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think it matters what our starting three is. Clearly, at the moment Raheem and Harry, their numbers are incredible and the consistency of their performance is, but the rest can be down to performance at any given time.\n\n\u201cAnd how we see the guys in training and their physical level. These guys know that Tammy coming through is going to push that. Callum Wilson is going to want to push \u2013 we can try to motivate the players but that competition for places is as much as a driver than anything else.\u201d\n\nSterling was also speaking ahead of Friday\u2019s qualifier at the Sinobo Stadium \u2013 home of Slavia Prague \u2013 and the Manchester City forward insists England must show similar attacking ability on the bigger stages of tournament football if they are to be considered among the best in the world.\n\n\u201cI think that there are a lot of great front threes in the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all players that are still getting better, still learning, but at the same time are producing as well, so, yes, it\u2019s an exciting front three.\n\n\u201cBut you know, we\u2019ve got to do it in big games, big tournaments. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll be judged if we\u2019re a great front three or not.\u201d\n\nLeicester\u00b4s James Maddison will have to wait a little longer for his international debut (Nigel French/PA)\n\nEngland are starting to build a strength in depth that is the envy of many a nation.\n\nSuch quality means in-form Leicester midfielder James Maddison arrived at his third international camp without a cap to his name \u2013 a wait that will continue after having to return to his club on the eve of the Czech Republic clash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult week for James, really,\u201d Southgate told talkSPORT.\n\n\u201cHe still had a bit of the ankle problem that he had pre the Liverpool game with Leicester.\n\n\u201cAnd then he has fallen ill over the last couple of days, so he wasn\u2019t going to be able to train and we decided the best thing was to send him back to his club.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had a chance he could have played a part against the Czechs or Bulgaria, Southgate said with a laugh: \u201cNot looking at how he was this morning, no!\n\n\u201cAgain, no point travelling with the rest of the team ill as well, so that was one of the issues.\n\n\u201cBut he hasn\u2019t trained all week, he wouldn\u2019t have trained until Saturday at the earliest and I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have been in a fit state for Monday.\u201d", "description": "England have blown away their Group A competition so far, scoring 19 goals from four qualifiers.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/wire-19561838-1570745624-270_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
