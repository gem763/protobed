They expelled me in 2019. I had a residence permit. Then I participated in a fight, and they denounced me. Because at that time, there was Salvini,\u201d the Tunisian said.\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s not there anymore and I\u2019m happy about it,\u201d he added. The migrant confirmed that many in Tunisia knew that Salvini was no longer in the Italian government and claimed that more migrants were leaving the North African country for Italy every day.\n\nSenator Salvini reacted to the interview with the Tunisian by saying: \u201c\u2018Expelled because of Salvini, he is already back. And with the new [Italian] government, many migrants are ready to leave Tunisia to come to Italy.\u2019 This is madness!

As interior minister, Matteo Salvini had closed the ports to NGO ships.\n\n\u201cNow the new leftist government is reopening the ports: hardly advocates of the Italians. Here, I see advocates of illegal immigrants,\u201d Salvini said last month.\n\n\u201cThe new government reopens the ports and Italy goes back to being Europe\u2019s REFUGEE CAMP,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cToday, slavers, racists, and colonisers, exploiters of women and men, are only found on the left,\u201d he added.", "description": "An illegal Tunisian migrant mocked populist leader Matteo Salvini after getting back into the country, saying he was glad Salvini was gone.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/GettyImages-53139595.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
