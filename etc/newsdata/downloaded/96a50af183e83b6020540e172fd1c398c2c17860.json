Only when they perceive a direct security threat do Americans generally pay close attention. The public just doesn\u2019t perceive much of a threat in what is happening in the Middle East \u2014 and, as usual, finds domestic concerns far more important. But that doesn\u2019t mean Trump\u2019s impulsive evacuation of American forces from Syria isn\u2019t without significant potential risks.\n\nMake no mistake, Trump has not helped himself in Syria. The polling consensus shows public disapproval of his actions. Both CBS/YouGov and Politico/Morning Consult put Trump at a 10-point and 7-point approve/disapprove deficit, respectively. The Economist actually asked two Syria approval questions: approval of President Trump Donald John TrumpCharles Barkley: 'Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up' Democrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Trump plans to appeal House subpoena for financial records to Supreme Court MORE\u2019s \u201chandling of Syria\u201d and approval of his decision to withdraw U.S. troops \u201cleaving Syrian Kurds who fought against ISIS vulnerable to attack.\u201d That poll showed an even larger deficit with 50 percent disapproving to 31 percent in support for the first question and 52 percent disapproving to 28 percent in support for the second. Fortunately for Trump \u2014 and at least in the near-term \u2014 these bad numbers don\u2019t mean much. The Economist/YouGov poll ranked foreign policy 14th out of 15 issues in importance at a miniscule 1 percent.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight points out, Trump still commands majority support on the issue from Republicans, but that\u2019s far from the whole story. GOP support ranges from 41 percent in the CBS poll to 56 percent in the Politico poll to as high as 69 percent in the Economist poll. But those number are far behind Republican support for Trump on other issues, where approval averages 84 percent on the top seven issues. Trump\u2019s worst approval among top issues is 78 percent on the environment \u2013 21 points better than the Syria withdrawal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe real danger for Trump is in that his actions increase political risk with little, if any practical benefit. It is true that a reduced American military profile puts fewer Americans in harm\u2019s way. It is also true that a withdrawal could be interpreted as weakness and encourage aggressive actions against American interests.\n\nTrump would benefit if he was satisfying some kind of \u201cbring the troops home\u201d clamor. But, there is no evidence \u2014 either in polling or anecdotally \u2014 that the public is really exercised on this issue. Consider that America has been mired in Afghanistan for over 17 years at enormous expense with no end in sight and no plan to complete its mission (whatever that may be). Yet Afghanistan polled 0 percent, dead last, among top issues.\n\nWhile Trump gains zero political benefit, he does increase the political risk for himself. If there is a terrorist incident connected to ISIS or another Middle Eastern group, Trump could be severely wounded. When the Economist poll asked if ISIS has been \u201cdefeated,\u201d 73 percent said \u201cNo,\u201d with little partisan difference \u2014 81 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of Republicans. Similar numbers still see ISIS as a threat \u2013 73 percent of Republicans and 73 percent of Democrats (59 percent of Independents). Furthermore, terrorism is one of only two issues where Americans give Trump positive approval. While the overall advantage is just one point (43 percent to 42 percent), Trump only polls better on the economy.\n\nWith the order for retreat originating solely with Trump and opposed by the military and majorities of Congress in both parties, any negative consequences will belong to Trump and Trump alone. Terrorism is one of only two issues where Trump earns positive approval ratings (second to the economy) and one of only three where Independents approve (by two points).\n\nBeyond a terrorism incident, the retreat from Syria raises a more general foreign policy risk. In a volatile Middle East, any security vacuum is a significant risk. With Iranian attacks on Saudi oil production, civil war in Yemen, oil tanker attacks, the region is more of a tinderbox that it has been in many years. A full-blown crisis that draws in the United States (as any major crisis will), would drag Trump into very dangerous political territory.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the rare cases where foreign policy becomes important to the American public, rallying around the President is fleeting, at best. In the four presidential elections where foreign policy issues were prominent (1952, Korean War; 1968 Viet Nam War; 1980 Iran hostage crisis; 2004, Gulf War), the incumbent party lost three times and barely scraped by in the fourth. In 2004 George W. Bush barely won re-election in spite of a strong economy and facing a weak Democratic candidate \u2014 two items which normally result in an easy re-election.\n\nThe political bottom line for Trump is that his actions on Syria have gained him nothing while creating significant future risk. As it is, Trump\u2019s strategy relies on the Democrats to fumble away the election. Ever more, Trump is counting on the mistakes of his opponents \u2014 and good luck \u2014 for re-election.\n\nKeith Naughton, Ph.D., co-founder of Silent Majority Strategies, is a public affairs consultant who specialized in Pennsylvania judicial elections.
