But icons recognize icons, so Jenner and best friend Stassie Karanikolaou pulled out all the stops to reenact the moment on Saturday night in impressive detail.\n\nThe makeup mogul went as the Material Girl \u2014 slicking her hair back in a bun, wearing a form-fitting black ensemble and carrying a top hat \u2014 while Karanikolaou channeled the pop princess in a white bridal number.\n\nIn an Instagram video, the two dance around to Madonna\u2019s \u201cLike A Virgin\u201d before Karanikolaou-as-Spears tells Jenner: \u201cKiss me.\u201d\n\nAnd so she does, but it\u2019s only a brief peck \u2014 not likely to cause nearly as much conversation as Madonna and Spears\u2019 lip lock, which went down as one of the most defining moments in award show history.\n\nWhile no one appeared to have dressed as Christina Aguilera \u2014 who, let us not forget, was also at the VMAs that year and also kissed Madonna on stage \u2014 Jenner laid that groundwork in a past Halloween.\n\nThe 22-year-old rocked the look from Aguilera\u2019s \u201cDirrrty\u201d era for a night back in 2016, complete with assless chaps.\n\nA post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Oct 30, 2016 at 12:03am PDT\n\nJenner seems to be making the most out of the holiday\u2019s outfit opportunities this year, sporting head-to-toe black leather for some pre-Halloween festivities earlier in the weekend.\n\nShe attended a J Balvin concert alongside friend Sofia Richie. The two seemed to have a night to remember, swigging tequila from the bottle backstage and running into musician will.i.am.\n\nAnd since we\u2019re dealing with the Kardashian-Jenners \u2014 there\u2019s no family that takes this holiday more seriously \u2014 expect to see the costumes to continue throughout the week, because you know Kim isn\u2019t about to be upstaged by her little sister.", "description": "The makeup mogul and her best friend Stassie Karanikolaou dipped into the pop culture archives for inspiration.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db5aa98210000eb2c34b2a9.png?cache=gbnhad3zmg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
