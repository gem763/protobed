Matt Cartwright, Pennsylvania Democrat, said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler announced a subpoena last week demanding that homeland security turn over documents on any potential pardons President Trump had discussed giving officials for carrying out his immigration policies.\n\nThe subpoena is part of the committee\u2019s investigation into whether it should recommend formal articles of impeachment, even though the panel itself has not yet voted to give Mr. Nadler official powers yet.\n\nHouse Democrats had said in court filings over the summer that their investigations of Mr. Trump were moving toward possible impeachment proceedings, and it appears they\u2019re poised to take more formal steps in that process this week.\n\nRep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the judiciary committee, on Sunday said House Democrats are making things up as they go along.\n\n\u201cThey just keep digging their hole - they just keep going after things because they hate the president so much,\u201d Mr. Collins, Georgia Republican, said earlier on the program. \u201cIf they really want to do this, they have to bring impeachment to the floor. This is simply a show. It is a travesty, and frankly they should be ashamed.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
