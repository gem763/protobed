REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nAuthorities lifted rain and flood warnings for the Kanto region around a becalmed Tokyo before dawn but imposed them on areas further north after Typhoon Hagibis blasted through the capital.\n\nAttention focused on Fukushima, where Tokyo Electric Power Co overnight reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which was crippled by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nFour people died in Chiba, Gunma, Kanagawa and Fukushima prefectures surrounding Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK. Among them was a man in his 60s who was found with no vital signs in a flooded apartment in Kawasaki, NHK said. Seventeen were missing early Sunday, it said.\n\nThe heavy rain caused a river in Nagano prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, to flood its banks. Some houses along the Chikuma river were nearly fully submerged in water and at least one person was rescued from the roof of a house by helicopter, NHK said. Part of a road was swept away in flooding.\n\nAuthorities issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Some 80 injuries have been reported so far, while more than 270,000 households lost power, NHK said.\n\nThe storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\nHagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday evening. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook Tokyo shortly after.\n\nMajor shinkansen bullet trains from Tokyo would begin on schedule Sunday, NHK said.\n\nOne expert, Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Center, told Reuters that further flooding could occur as several surrounding prefectures began releasing water from dams, letting it flow downstream.\n\nAbout 1.5 million people in Tokyo live below sea level.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of potential for once in decades rain totals. It lifted the alerts early Sunday.\n\nJust last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages.\n\nThe capital\u2019s main airports, Haneda and Narita, stopped flights from landing and connecting trains were suspended, forcing the cancellation of more than a thousand flights.\n\nMany people in and around Tokyo took shelter in temporary evacuation facilities early, before the worst of the storm arrived.\n\nYuka Ikemura, a 24-year-old nursery school teacher, was in one such facility at a community centre in eastern Tokyo with her 3-year-old son, 8-month-old daughter and their pet rabbit.\n\nShe said she decided to move before it was too late.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got small children to take care of and we live on the first floor of an old apartment,\u201d Ikemura told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cWe brought with us the bare necessities. I\u2019m scared to think about when we will have run out diapers and milk.\u201d\n\nThe Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada on Sunday in Kamaishi was cancelled. Two matches were cancelled on Saturday.\n\nFormula One Grand Prix organisers had cancelled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday.", "description": "Four people were killed and 17 were missing after the most powerful typhoon to hit Japan in decades paralysed Tokyo, flooding rivers and putting millions under evacuation warning before it plowed up the northeastern coast.", "authors": ["Makiko Yamazaki", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440197969&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0OM", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
