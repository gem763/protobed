Here are 10 myths debunked about one of the most common contraceptive methods, birth control pills.\n\nAs the battle over reproductive rights rages on, understanding the basics of birth control is important. But it is also confusing, especially with the many myths surrounding the pill.\n\nDr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News' chief medical correspondent, said the most important thing to understand about using the pill is that you're not putting anything new in your body.\n\n\"A lot of times, I'll hear women say, 'I don't want to take the pill because I don't want to put hormones in my body,'\" she told \"GMA.\" \"Those hormones are already in our bodies.\"\n\nIn fact, birth control pills contain a combination of the hormones estrogen and progestin, which a woman's body already makes. These hormones override the signals from a woman's brain to her ovaries and suppress the ovulation process.\n\n\"GMA\" sat down with Ashton to debunk other myths about the pill and to learn about its other uses.\n\nMyth No. 1: You have to start the pill on the first Sunday after your period.\n\nThe idea of starting your period on a specific day of the week doesn't make sense since your body doesn't know what day of the week it is.\n\nAshton often tells her patients to start on the second day of bleeding, regardless of what day of the week it is.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nMyth No. 2: You get your period on the pill.\n\nBleeding on the pill is not called a period, it's called a withdrawal bleed or breakthrough bleeding. If you're getting a period on the pill, your birth control is not working to prevent pregnancies.\n\nMyth No. 3: All pills are the same.\n\nAll pills are not created equally. It's important to read the packaging of the pill you've been prescribed to understand the doses of estrogen and progestin.\n\nMyth No. 4: Your body needs a break from being on birth control, especially before you get pregnant.\n\nThere is no minimum or maximum time period for being on the pill. If you choose to get off the pill, those hormones are out of your system within days and your brain starts communicating with your ovaries.\n\nMyth No. 5: The pill is perfect for every woman.\n\nThe pill is not for everyone. Some women react to pills differently than others. Other women don't take the pill for medical reasons. It is different for everyone. It is not a one-size-fits-all experience.\n\nMyth No. 6: It doesn't matter what time you take the pill. As long as you take it every day, you're fine.\n\nThe body's hormonal levels fluctuate every hour and every day. The pill works by suppressing those signals from brain to ovaries and from the ovaries to the uterus. The hormone levels from the pill have to be maintained and to do so, it's important to take the pill at roughly the same time everyday.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nMyth No. 7: The pill makes acne worse.\n\nWell, yes and no. There can be an initial flare up when you first start taking the pill. That is normal and is part of the hormonal signals.\n\nThe acne will get worse before it gets better. Down the road, your skin will be better on the pill than off the pill.\n\nMyth No. 8: I was on the pill in the past and hated it. I don't want to get on it again.\n\nYour symptoms to the pill in the past will be different from what it could be for you now. Try different pills, doses and formulations to find the pill that is right for you.\n\nMyth No. 9: I can smoke and take the pill.\n\nNo. It increases the risk of thrombotic events. It is dangerous and it is playing with your life.\n\nMyth No. 10: I'll gain a lot of weight on the pill.\n\nSignificant weight gain is uncommon with birth control pills. Women gain an average of 1 to 2 pounds while on the pill.\n\nThis report was originally published on Sept. 4, 2019.", "description": "Dr. Jennifer Ashton debunks many myths surrounding birth control while explaining the benefits and risks involved in hormonal contraception.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/birth-control-stock-gty-jef-190903_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
