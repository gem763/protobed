That\u2019s what Uncle Jack (David Oyelowo) insists to his niece Ashley (Storm Reid) in the new sci-fi film, \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go.\u201d In the film, which is in theaters Friday, Ashley is preserved from an earlier timeline \u2014 one before she, her mom (Shinelle Azoroh) and her dad (Brian Tyree Henry) were murdered. This theme of hope and perseverance can be traced back to Octavia Butler\u2019s 1993 science fiction novel, \u201cParable of the Sower.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all anybody can do right now. Live. Hold out. Survive,\u201d Butler wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether good times are coming back again. But I know that won\u2019t matter if we don\u2019t survive these times.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been decades since Butler first emboldened her readers to imagine themselves in a world yet unseen, but today, Hollywood has started to recognize the importance of her message, as more Black female lead characters endure unfathomable odds in film and television. In \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go,\u201d Ashley races against the calendar to avert a messy police-involved drug deal to save her life and her parents\u2019 lives. In \u201cFast Color,\u201d which has just been picked up for an Amazon series order, Gugu Mbatha-Raw is a woman with a supernatural gift struggling to survive in a world on the brink of extinction. And in \u201cSee You Yesterday,\u201d Eden Duncan-Smith\u2019s character builds a time machine to try to prevent the fatal shooting of her brother by police.\n\nLACEY TERRELL/UNIVERSAL PICTURES Storm Reid in \"Don't Let Go.\"\n\nThese films follow an impressive \u2014 though sporadic \u2014 tradition of Black women and girls as lead characters striving to protect their mortality. This cinematic lineage includes Jurnee Smollett-Bell in 1997\u2019s \u201cEve\u2019s Bayou,\u201d Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae in 2016\u2019s \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d and Reid in last year\u2019s \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d\n\nOn the TV side, women like Nichelle Nichols and Sonequa Martin-Green in the \u201cStar Trek\u201d franchise, Gina Torres in \u201cFirefly,\u201d Freema Agyeman in \u201cSense8,\u201d Thandie Newton in \u201cWestworld,\u201d and Nafessa Williams in \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d have contributed to the trend.\n\nStill, nothing compares to what we\u2019re experiencing right now, which is a steady flow of sci-fi releases featuring Black women and girls front and center, trying to defeat otherworldly obstacles that bear a stark resemblance to the problems we face in the real world.\n\nHowever, it would be na\u00efve to think that white-dominated Hollywood would suddenly greenlight a larger quantity of these films without proof they\u2019d be successful. Tananarive Due, an author and screenwriter who also lectures on Black horror and Afrofuturism at UCLA, credits the record-breaking commercial success of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d \u2014 which features female warriors as focal characters fighting to preserve the motherland Wakanda \u2014 for forcing the industry to finally value sci-fi films with Black women as lead characters.\n\n\u201cBlack women characters like Okoye [Danai Gurira] and Shuri [Letitia Wright] are as popular as T\u2019Challa [Chadwick Boseman],\u201d Due told HuffPost. \u201cBefore, we didn\u2019t have an example of a Black sci-fi movie that everyone had seen, and nobody wants to lose money. As long as it feels like a sure thing, it\u2019s going to be a very interesting time ahead.\u201d\n\nDue also points to increased enthusiasm for literary adaptations, including her own. \u201cI\u2019ve been publishing since 1995,\u201d she said. But recently, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a huge bump of interest in my [earlier novels]. I have more work either under option or being negotiated for option at the same time now than I ever have before.\u201d\n\nThough she\u2019s keeping mum about which of her books have been optioned for the silver screen, Due was happy to discuss other literary titans such as Butler, Tomi Adeyemi and Matt Ruff. They created valiant Black heroines battling supernatural plagues, slavery and other miseries in their works \u201cWild Seed,\u201d \u201cChildren of Blood and Bone,\u201d and \u201cLovecraft Country,\u201d respectively, and will at last be getting the recognition they deserve on screen in the coming months.\n\n\u201cMore executives and producers who\u2019ve been championing this work for years are finally seeing daylight in the pitching room,\u201d Due said. \u201c\u2018Children of Blood and Bone\u2019 is going to be a Lucasfilm production, the first one that isn\u2019t a \u2018Star Wars\u2019 or an \u2018Indiana Jones.\u2019 That is huge.\u201d\n\nOther than their rising prominence, Due sees Black female-led sci-fi as a space for audiences to more comfortably address miscarriages of justice that have become more centralized in our conversations.\n\n\u201cThese stories are so perfect as metaphors for social justice ills or ills within the family, like in \u2018Eve\u2019s Bayou,\u2019\u201d Due said. \u201cThey give us just enough distance from real life, so that we can look at it more critically. It\u2019s tough to talk about Black families losing their children to police and gun violence. If you make it a time travel story [like in \u2018See You Yesterday\u2019], you can relax just enough to dream of a better life and world.\u201d\n\nLinda Kallerus/Netflix Eden Duncan-Smith is on a mission to save her brother in Netflix's \"See You Yesterday.\"\n\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to consider this influx as an indication of a new Hollywood, it\u2019s hard to forget that black films have often experienced waves of success only for that to dissipate after a few years. The Black rom-com heyday of the \u201990s comes to mind, when there were films like \u201cLove Jones,\u201d \u201cHow Stella Got Her Groove Back\u201d and a host of others. That same time period also produced a slew of Black crime films like \u201cSet It Off\u201d and \u201cNew Jack City.\u201d Still, Due remains hopeful about what\u2019s happening now.\n\n\u201cThere are so many different platforms now, and so many more Black writers and directors getting exposed to genre,\u201d she explains. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can repeat what happened in the \u201990s, when it felt like the spigot was just going off.\u201d\n\nBut she is cautious of the enormous responsibility of Black sci-fi protagonists when considered against the \u201cstrong Black woman\u201d trope. While the heroines in films like \u201cBlack Panther\u201d are worthy of praise, their depictions sometimes don\u2019t allow much room for vulnerability or nuance. \u201cAs Black women, we have to understand that we can\u2019t always be expected to carry people with us,\u201d Due said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between leading and carrying. Leading is great. Carrying will break you.\u201d\n\nWhat remains at the root of these stories \u2014 whether it\u2019s a young Black girl struggling to prevent her future murder due to systemic violence in \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go\u201d or a woman navigating her extraordinary powers to save the world in \u201cFast Color\u201d \u2014 is a desire for Black female preservation, the kind of heroism to which we can all aspire and relate.\n\n\u201cIn stories like \u2018Fast Color,\u2019 they\u2019re on the brink of an apocalypse, so it hardly feels like fiction on one level,\u201d Due said. \u201cTimes are so hard, and we fear that we\u2019re not safe. So images of people fighting for Black women\u2019s futurity are very inspirational. To paraphrase Queen Ramonda [Angela Bassett], this is our time \u2014 and we\u2019ve earned it.\u201d", "description": "In several recent sci-fi/fantasy films, Black women and girls are at the forefront as they try to defeat otherworldly obstacles.", "authors": ["Tv", "Film Journalist"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d66e68a2500004e00887252.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
