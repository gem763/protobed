REUTERS/Manaure Quintero\n\nMoscow has acted as a lender of last resort for Venezuela\u2019s leftist administration, with the government and oil giant Rosneft providing at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006.\n\nWith dozens of Western and Latin American nations regarding Maduro as illegitimate, due to allegations he rigged a 2018 election, Russia and China\u2019s support have been crucial.\n\nPresiding over a meeting of the Russian-Venezuelan intergovernmental commission in Caracas with Borisov, Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami thanked Moscow, especially for facilitating oil shipments despite U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cRussian-Venezuelan relations are at their best moment and we\u2019ve shown that in the middle of difficulties we can advance together, with efficient political and diplomatic coordination between both governments against the imperial siege and aggression which Russia also suffers,\u201d he said.\n\nBorisov reiterated Moscow\u2019s support for Maduro, even though many other nations regard him as an autocrat and have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s president.\n\nIncreasing bilateral trade \u201cis a demonstration that President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government is legitimate,\u201d Borisov was quoted as saying by Venezuelan state media.\n\nThe Interfax news agency quoted Borisov\u2019s office as saying he would also meet Maduro.\n\nThe Venezuelan leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin briefly discussed Caracas\u2019 debt obligations to Russia during Maduro\u2019s visit to Moscow last month.\n\nThe meeting between Maduro and the Russian official is due to happen days after Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visited Cuba, an ally of Venezuela.\n\nMedvedev said Moscow would find ways to help Cuba secure supplies of oil and petroleum products.\n\nA flotilla of shipments from Venezuela gave Cuba some respite this week. But the support from two of its closest allies looks unlikely to resolve Cuba\u2019s pressing fuel problems, which have seen the government extend many of the energy-saving measures it has introduced over the past month.", "description": "Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov was in Caracas on Saturday to underline Moscow's support for Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro that has helped him stay in power despite intense Western pressure to quit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437496454&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940L5", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
