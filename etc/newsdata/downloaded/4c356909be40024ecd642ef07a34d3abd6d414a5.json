Many of its ideas come from inside the organization, like \"Business Wars\" and \"Imagined Life.\" Others come from its news tip inbox, which has led to some of their most successful podcasts like \"Dr. Death,\" a Wondery chart-topper that started as a tip about a neurosurgeon from a \"Dirty John\" listener.\n\n\"First, we look for great stories,\" Sargent told Business Insider. \"We look for character-driven stories with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\"\n\nSuccessful audio stories also have to have a limited number of characters, Sargent said, because a \"Game of Thrones\"-style narrative with multiple characters and stories would be impossible to follow exclusively with sound.\n\nThey need to be realistic in terms of access to sources who can give interviews and budget for expenses like travel and licensing rights. They need to be relatable to resonate with a broad audience. And they need to be compelling enough to make them binge-worthy.\n\n\"We're focused on what we call emotionally immersive storytelling,\" said Marshall Lewy, chief content officer at Wondery. \"Even when it's a true story, we'll think about the narrative elements that make it compelling and interesting to the listener.\"\n\nPartnerships help a podcast thrive\n\nIn addition to the LA Times, Wondery has teamed up with media outlets like Bloomberg, Boston Globe, and The Athletic for shows.\n\nThese organizations often provide prize-winning reporters to tell stories with Wondery, but even the best journalists can't automatically transition to audio storytelling without help.\n\n\"Any print journalists who then makes a podcast will tell you it's a lot different to write for the ear and a lot more work to produce a podcast than they think going in,\" Lewy said.\n\nSargent said Wondery's partnership with Universal Music Group was the first time a record label teamed up with a podcast. The deal allows Wondery to use licensed music from Universal Music Group, a major step for the podcast industry, as music licensing is often prohibitively expensive.\n\nWondery has even worked with direct competitors. This past summer it launched a new podcast platform with Stitcher called Podfront to facilitate ad buys.\n\nWondery is now working with the LA Times' Chris Goffard, who hosted \"Dirty John,\" on a show called \"Detective Trapp\" that's set to be released in November, Sargent said.\n\nPodcast production time at Wondery can range from less than two months to almost a year\n\nOnce Wondery approves a podcast idea, it can take almost a year of investigating, interviewing, writing scripts, perfecting sound design, and more before it's ready to air, Sargent said.\n\nIn rare cases, Wondery can crank out a podcast more quickly. \"The Mysterious Mr. Epstein\" was greenlit in August when Jeffrey Epstein died and premiered on Oct. 1, less than two months later.\n\nAfter producers gather content from interviews and scripts, they set the story arc. With true crime podcasts and investigations, the story direction may change even after episodes have aired, so there's room built in for updates.\n\nBefore shows go live, Wondery hosts internal listening events for their employees to gather feedback, Sargent said.\n\n\"You just have a voice and sound design and the words to really immerse somebody and bring them in,\" Lewy said.\n\nAs more professional podcasts enter the market, it's getting harder for amateur podcasters to grab listeners.\n\n\"Ask yourself what is new and different and unique about the podcast you want to make,\" he said. \"We've hit a point where there are so many and it's getting harder and harder to break through the clutter.\"\n\nBut the barrier to entry for podcasting is still low and even an amateur podcast can become a hit if it's emotionally gripping.\n\n\"That's really excited for anyone independent trying to get started,\" Sargent said.", "description": "Wondery, the company behind hits like \"Dirty John\" and \"Dr. Death,\" revealed the keys to making a successful podcast.", "authors": ["Alyssa Meyers"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5dad54af90935b2338cfe?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
