The limited series will probably use these events as the focus, though Comey also served as FBI director for four years under the Obama administration.\n\nScreenwriter Billy Ray described Emmy Award-winning Daniels, who recently portrayed former FBI counterterrorism chief John O\u2019Neill in Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Looming Tower,\u201d as \u201cperfect\u201d for the part. \u201cWe talked backstage after I saw him in \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019 on Broadway, and I knew I was looking at the only person who could play Jim Comey,\u201d Ray said in a statement to Variety. \u201cLucky for me, he said yes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRay also had praise for Brendan Gleeson, who is slated to play Trump in the CBS series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger acting challenge than playing Donald Trump,\u201d Ray said of Gleeson, who is well-known for playing Alastor \u201cMad-Eye\u201d Moody in the Harry Potter franchise. \u201cYou have to have presence and a singular kind of dynamism. You also have to have the courage and the will to play Trump\u2019s psychology from the inside out.\u201d\n\nThe cast also includes \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d actor Michael Kelly as acting FBI director Andrew McCabe and \u201cA Gifted Man\u201d actress Jennifer Ehle as Comey\u2019s wife, Patrice.\n\nRay conducted serious background research for the show, traveling to Washington to meet with Comey, his family, FBI agents, prominent journalists and other Washington bigwigs to ensure an accurate portrayal of real-life events.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s distinctive antics, and those of his administration, have been fodder for parodies and social commentary since he took office, but this series appears to be one of the few dramas that seek to portray a president and his administration while they are still in office. TV\u2019s most formative political shows, such as \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cMadame Secretary,\u201d have touched on familiar yet fictionalized scenarios, and they have not portrayed real-life players.\n\nCBS Studios has not yet determined whether the series will the available on Showtime or CBS Access, but production is planned for November, with a release date to be announced later.\n\nAD", "description": "The CBS Studios show will be based on the former FBI director's best-selling memoir.", "authors": ["Nina Zafar", "Reporter", "Editorial Aide For Reliable Source"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RIy-51YbmnvZYrzaphSBIo5mfho=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P4FXJGHJHYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
