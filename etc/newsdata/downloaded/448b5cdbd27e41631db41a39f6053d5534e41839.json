Here\u2019s some footage from the vaults of Seabird triumphing in 1965, Sea the Stars pulling clear and holding on during his all-conquering year in 2009, and Dancing Brave in 1986, with Pat Eddery on board, claiming the second of three consecutive Arc wins.\n\n2) Trust the Orioles\u2019 Stevie Wilkerson to leave the catch of the season until the last game of the MLB season, against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. It\u2019s quite something.\n\n3) Tottenham can take a just a shred of comfort from the fact that their 7-2 home defeat by Bayern Munich is not actually their worst hammering in Europe. That sorry record is owned by the class of 1995, who lost 8-0 at Cologne in the Intertoto Cup. To be fair to manager Gerry Francis, though, he fielded a squad of loan players and reserves. \u201cWe had no players,\u201d said Francis. \u201cWe were all looking at players just to see if we could get a team out that was the best standard we could manage. We got some sort of permission to bring players in. Alan Pardew was one of them.\u201d Ah.\n\n4) Track action at the World Athletics Championships concludes this weekend, as is traditional, with relay finals, so let\u2019s spin back to some classic races of yesteryear. Here\u2019s the American 4x100m quartet of Emmit King, Willie Gault, Calvin Smith and Carl Lewis setting a then-world record in Helsinki 36 years ago. Lewis was anchored the USA\u2019s world record-breaking team at the 1991 championships in Tokyo. But the American hold on the mark was shattered with Jamaica\u2019s emergence \u2013 the team of Steve Mullings, Michael Frater, Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell in 2009, and again two years later when Bolt led them home alongside Nesta Carter, Frater again and Yohan Blake.\n\nHere\u2019s another triumphant Jamaican performance, from Beijing 2015, when Veronica Campbell-Brown, Natasha Morrison, Elaine Thompson and the all-conquering Shelly-Anne Fraser-Price stormed home in championship record time. And let\u2019s roll back the years to some of the most impressive British performances \u2013 Joan Baptiste, Kathy Cook, Beverley Callender and Shirley Thomas taking silver behind East Germany in 1983. Over in the 4x400m, clear five minutes from your day and enjoy Roger Black, John Regis, Derek Redmond and Kriss Akabusi\u2019s miracle of Tokyo 1991.\n\n5) Chile v Uruguay seven-a-side: tasty goal, tasty reaction.\n\n6) Shakhtar Donetsk\u2019s youth team revive memories of Thierry Henry and Robert Pires with this one-two penalty against Atalanta, though the Ukrainian side scored this one effortlessly, unlike the Arsenal pair back in 2005. Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez made no such mistakes when they teamed up in 2016.\n\nOur favourites from below the line last week\n\n1) Is this a goal or not? No technology check was available.\n\n2) Some snooker flukes, flair and farces.\n\n3) Supercar mishaps: when plans go wrong.\n\nSpotters\u2019 badges: Mike Smith, whobroughtoranges\n\nGuardian YouTube football channel\n\nDo subscribe, if you fancy.\n\nGuardian YouTube sport channel\n\nDo subscribe, if you fancy.", "description": "This week\u2019s roundup also features Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe memories, another Spurs drubbing and seven-a-side passions", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ccc5639590178ee4a66182a2a89c3acd2205bb/0_113_2314_1388/master/2314.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a370ef3ff41166dee287748c2b2890b6"}
