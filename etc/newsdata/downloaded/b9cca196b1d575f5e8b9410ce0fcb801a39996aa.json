It\u2019s a muggy afternoon, a breeze barely lifting off of the New York Harbor, after days of heavy rain. She manoeuvres throngs of tourists, construction workers and suits streaming out of office tours for lunch as she walks north from the waterfront park toward the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nIn a skirt suit and flats, Bavishi fits in among lower Manhattan\u2019s workday hustle. But there\u2019s no one else with a job like hers: director of the New York City\u2019s mayor\u2019s office of resiliency. She is the woman tasked with protecting all 580 miles of New York City shoreline from more frequent and extreme storms and expected sea rise due to the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cWe have got a chance to really reimagine the waterfront,\u201d she says, heading underneath FDR Drive past interim flood barriers erected by the city following Hurricane Sandy. There\u2019s an air of promise and forward-thinking in her stride. \u201cI think that\u2019s really exciting,\u201d she exhales.\n\nThis walk with Bavishi is, in fact, an exercise in imagining: in March, the mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced an ambitious $10bn proposal to extend Manhattan\u2019s southern coastline into the East River as far as 500ft.\n\nBavishi\u2019s walk from Battery Park almost to the Brooklyn Bridge is the roughly one-mile span proposed for expansion. It includes the financial district, sparkling residential towers and the luxury mixed-use community Battery Park City, where a one-bedroom condo is about $1m.\n\nTwelve miles north, in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, the waterfront outlines a much different scene. A stench rises from the sidewalks in the summer heat, open garages reveal heaps of auto body parts and cyclists swerve between box trucks that dominate the streets. About 13,000 people live in aging apartment buildings at the center of this peninsula, lined on either site by heavily industrialized waterfront.\n\nHunts Point residents and activists fought for years to increase access to the waterfront as well as address longstanding environmental issues. More recently they have engaged with the mayor\u2019s office of resiliency, formed in 2014 to oversee New York City\u2019s $20bn portfolio of programs to make the city more resilient to the climate crisis. In Hunts Point, residents reimagined in a waterfront that addressed longstanding environmental injustices and poverty that persists in the area.\n\nThe Hunts Point community spent five years developing a plan for protective waterfront infrastructure doubling as public green space, a \u201cLevee Lab\u201d to study resiliency efforts and create local jobs, and a tri-generation plant creating low-carbon cooling and a micro-grid to supply backup power in emergencies. But around the same time De Blasio introduced his $10bn proposal, the office of resiliency decided it would not fund that plan, due to high cost and because Hunts Points residents do not live in the floodplain.\n\nThat decision hit this community hard, one of several in New York City finding it can\u2019t face a future of climate change without quality of life issues being addressed first. In preparing for its future, the city would have to confront injustices of its past, and some environmental activists fear the city is not up to the task.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office of resiliency set a goal for holistic resiliency planning across the five boroughs, but there\u2019s a lingering question: how does the city enforce waterfront protection for all, when some of it is home to billions of dollars of real estate, infrastructure and investment, and others have been neglected for decades?\n\nAs the climate crisis promises to lay bare the stark disparities of New York City, the answer has never been more pressing.\n\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nFor the past five years, the environmental activist Angela Tovar has posted flyers, maps, renderings, artwork and a rally poster that reads \u201cPollution Isn\u2019t the Solution\u201d all over the South Bronx Community Resiliency Agenda Lab at the cavernous Hunts Point community hub called the Point.\n\nAs director of community development at the lab, Tovar is constantly hustling about, running late today because a discussion about the Point\u2019s community-led resiliency plan with the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ran long.\n\n\u201cOur work on climate justice started a long time ago,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it came from an understanding that there are a high volume of toxic substances in this area, which is also vulnerable to storm surge.\u201d\n\nTovar points to a large map with about 20 red dots marking the peninsula\u2019s waterfront \u2013 they represent businesses with high volumes of toxic substances. She identifies the residential blocks between the waterfront as an \u201cenvironmental justice community where about half the community lives below the poverty line, and there are really serious public health issues we know will be compounded by climate change\u201d.\n\nTovar then points to chunk of the peninsula, the entire north-eastern half, occupied by the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center, which spans 60 acres and supplies food to the entire north-eastern corridor. \u201cNot only are we talking about a potential threat of storm surge hitting an environmental justice community, and hitting businesses with toxic chemicals, we are talking about how that would impact the food distribution center,\u201d she says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A customer walks past a display of produce at the Hunts Point Terminal Produce Market in the Bronx.

Meanwhile, community organizers like Tovar had already been advocating for the city to also take stock of the poverty, isolation and longstanding environmental injustices across the peninsula. The office of and resiliency ultimately decided to focus on strengthening buildings inside the food distribution center instead of moving ahead on a comprehensive waterfront resiliency plan. (Bavishi says the decision was made because the Hunts Point\u2019s residential community is not located in the floodplain.)\n\nHer voice strains and head shakes recalling how that news came around the same time De Blasio announced his $10bn investment in building new land in lower Manhattan. \u201cIt felt like a tremendous slap in the face, to be honest,\u201d she says.\n\nTovar acknowledges that the $10bn is far from secured, but points out the South Bronx lacks even a promise of funding.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re saying is make that same commitment to the most vulnerable communities in New York City,\u201d she says. \u201cGet up on stage, make that commitment and say: \u2018Low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately burdened by climate change.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstead of relying on the city, local activists have moved ahead on smaller projects without the city, such as launching a community wifi network resistant to power and internet outages. The Point also runs the Be a Buddy program, which is building a network of local volunteers who learn how to provide resources, aid and immediate support during climate emergencies like heatwaves or storms. \u201cWe just have to continue to move on our own,\u201d Tovar says, with a hint of defeat in her voice.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nIn another borough on another waterfront, another underserved community has come up with their own program to train residents to help one another. It\u2019s called Local Leaders and is a 10-week emergency preparedness training run by the not-for-profit Red Hook Initiative (RHI) out of a converted warehouse a few blocks from the Gowanus Expressway, in Red Hook, Brooklyn.\n\nUnlike the South Bronx, Hurricane Sandy devastated Red Hook, transforming RHI into de facto recovery headquarters. The thousands of residents seeking help were primarily public housing residents \u2013 this neighborhood has the second highest concentration in the city. Red Hook embodies perhaps the greatest challenge facing New York as it braces for the climate crisis: nearly one-fifth of all housing units within New York\u2019s floodplain are public housing, and the city\u2019s public housing agency struggles to provide even basic services to residents.\n\nTevina Willis moved into the sprawling public housing complex about a decade ago. During Sandy, she and her neighbors ran up and down stairs, hauling water and spreading information about available resources. She was one of the first graduates of Local Leaders after RHI initiated it in 2013 to empower residents with emergency preparedness tactics such as CPR and conflict resolution; now she facilitates incoming groups. \u201cLocal Leaders further connected me to my neighbors,\u201d Willis says, \u201cAnd it took off from there.\u201d\n\nDuring an August block party hosted by RHI, a conversation with Willis about resiliency kept returning to housing. \u201cOur electricity constantly goes out, every other day there\u2019s an electrical fire in someone\u2019s apartment,\u201d she details over pop and rap music blasting from the DJ booth. \u201cA lot of our tenants experience gas outages.\u201d She points to a resident who recently went without gas for six months.\n\nWillis is helping spearhead the next phase for trained Local Leaders: \u201ca social justice and community organizing campaign to fight for policy change\u201d with a focus on improving public housing. \u201cWe need resiliency inside our apartments,\u201d she says.\n\nOn a quieter day, RHI\u2019s chief strategy officer, Javier Lopez, spoke about the larger resiliency vision for the neighborhood. While the city has installed some interim flood protections since Sandy, a larger plan to install floodwalls, raise streets and improve drainage to protect housing has yet to be implemented. Like Willis, Lopez struggles to reconcile the planning process with glaring needs of public housing residents. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to project the future when the present hasn\u2019t been addressed,\u201d he says.\n\nHe spoke of a divide between low-income, marginalized residents and the scientific, architectural and urban planning community advancing resiliency plans. \u201cSometimes we walk into these meetings and the architects and scientists are coming in at a 10, and we\u2019re at a two,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cNo one from the resiliency world has had the awareness to take into account that neighborhoods have faced structural racism and various forms of disinvestment,\u201d he continues. \u201cThere are voices missing, there are areas of concern, there hasn\u2019t been a restoration of what was lost since Sandy.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nAlong our lower Manhattan walk, and again in a quick telephone conversation, I ask Bavishi how she weighs the needs of different waterfront communities in resiliency planning. \u201cAn incredible amount of community engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cOur goal is to be thoughtful and inclusive, recognizing there is no silver bullet and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. We have to work with communities to figure out the right solutions for particular neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nShe points to an inter-agency plan developed in Edgemere, in Rockaway, Queens. Edgemere has been called one of the most neglected neighborhoods in New York City and is particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis because it\u2019s sandwiched between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. During Sandy, flooding from both waterfronts \u2013 one lined with a defunct landfill, the other a city-owned wasteland \u2013 debilitated the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe were able to engage communities in thinking holistically about what would make their neighborhood more resilient,\u201d Bavishi says. The resulting plan includes buying hurricane-destroyed houses to turn into parks, transit upgrades, raising homes and the shoreline, building a new mixed-use complex and improving the public housing lining the bay.\n\nSonia Moise watched the calm waters of the bay meet the fierce waves of the ocean from her bedroom window in Edgemere the night of Sandy.\n\nThe promise of Edgemere as a more resilient neighborhood is overshadowed by her seven-year struggle to recover from that day. \u201cThere\u2019s no amount of people who complain like we do about [recovery] work not being done the right way,\u201d she says. \u201cI honestly believe we were treated the absolute worst because of location.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Debris sits on a still-closed beach area damaged by flooding from Hurricane Sandy near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Staten Island, on 1 March 2013. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nOutside of her three-story home hoisted atop a slab of concrete, she mentioned how long it took to grow backyard grass because the property was built atop rocks and sand. This spring she wrapped a stormproofing renovation, funded by her savings as well as the city\u2019s post-Sandy rebuilding program, Build it Back. But the saga isn\u2019t over: she recently hired a lawyer to dispute the quality of work from Build it Back, which she feels will not sufficiently protect her from the next storm.\n\n\u201cWe need to feel we\u2019re safe,\u201d she says of her community\u2019s lingering trauma recovering from Sandy. But there\u2019s a larger threat beyond the next storm: Edgemere will be one of the first New York neighborhoods made uninhabitable by the climate crisis. There\u2019s already a division emerging on Moise\u2019s block: homes with raised elevation \u2013 like her own \u2013 and those still at ground level. \u201cThe people who haven\u2019t raised their houses know they won\u2019t be able to stay,\u201d she says.\n\nThe city offered to buy Moise\u2019s property following Sandy, but she declined. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the city, that they\u2019d give the money you want for your house,\u201d she says. Would she consider selling if she knew she would get a fair payment? \u201cProbably not,\u201d she says, considering the grievances built up during the recovery process. \u201cI have a disdain for the city.\u201d\n\nSo Moise will stay, as her neighborhood is both transformed by the climate crisis and the city\u2019s efforts to protect it. On the cusp of such transformation, there\u2019s a quiet, almost eerie atmosphere walking the streets \u2013 even a level of disbelief that Edgemere does, in fact, belongs to the same city as lower Manhattan.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWhen De Blasio announced his ambitious proposal to expand lower Manhattan, he listed the reasons it was worth saving: home to a half-million jobs, 90,000 residents, the nexus of nearly all the city\u2019s subway lines. He left out that the city and private sector have heavily invested in this neighborhood since the early 1700s, when it emerged as a financial hub, as other waterfronts became places to house poor New Yorkers, often alongside toxic industrial sites.\n\nBavishi\u2019s goal to holistically address it all is daunting, if not impossible. Funding sources to implement many of the city\u2019s resiliency plans \u2013 including lower Manhattan\u2019s \u2013 are uncertain. Plans in neighborhoods such as Red Hook have stalled. Crucial city agencies such as the New York City housing authority, which oversees public housing along the floodplain, lack its own vision and funding for resiliency. And, as Tovar mentioned in the resiliency lab, De Blasio still has yet to get on a stage and acknowledge low-income communities are disproportionately burdened by the climate crisis.\n\nBavishi ultimately acknowledges the office of and resiliency does not have the capability to address all the longstanding concerns of marginalized communities. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to climate challenges we\u2019re facing and we want to take that seriously,\u201d she tells me over the phone. \u201cWe also want to make sure we\u2019re not raising expectations for other solutions that are out of sync with the resources we have.\u201d\n\nSo New York is left to see how its most vulnerable residents will survive as the city\u2019s shorelines are transformed \u2013 when the ambitious resiliency plans fall through, when stormproofing can\u2019t address day-to-day needs like safer housing.\n\n\u201cHaving an exciting, bold vision is not enough,\u201d Tovar says of the Hunts Point resiliency plan, though she could be talking about the rest of the city. \u201cI hope the city comes back to the table to think big and do something unprecedented, because we\u2019re New York City. But how do we encourage them to do that?\u201d", "description": "The city is taking action to protect lower Manhattan\u2019s waterfront while low-income residents in other boroughs must fend for themselves", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e04b1265ad90ea9d8cc8a2db1f01bff06134b875/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b93538192737116d605b09d30a75942c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
