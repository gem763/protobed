The national working committee (NWC) will meet on Monday and we will know then why he is taking time,\" he said.\n\nOne source within the NEC said Makhura has been dragging his feet because he did not believe in the decision. The source said Makhura was conflicted over who he should drop from his cabinet.\n\nLegoete said the NEC was not aware that Makhura was refusing to take its instruction, adding that the NEC was the overriding structure and that its decisions were binding.\n\n\"Failure to implement will be serious. This decision is not unique to Gauteng, it has been implemented in all other provinces. It's not about him. All other provinces have accepted this and swallowed it. I don\u2019t see why Gauteng will not implement it,\" he said.\n\nLast week, City Press reported that Gauteng government sources had said it was likely that David Mamabolo would swap with Gauteng legislature deputy speaker Vuyo Mhlakaza.\n\nMamabolo would be deputy speaker and Mhlakaza would be the new MEC in his place, City Press reported. The NEC insider, however, said that removing Mamabolo would potentially alienate the SACP.\n\nCurrently, Makhura has 10 MECs, half of whom are female.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
