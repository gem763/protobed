Another had to give all his money to his enslavers who locked him up between shifts.\n\nHyland said Britain should look at New York which had introduced controls on nail bars.\n\nHis successor Sara Thornton said the majority of the report's 35 recommendations had not been implemented.\n\n\"Although we don't yet know the full details of this case, it appears to bear the hallmarks of human trafficking,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\"My office will be looking at what more can be done to improve our response to this heinous crime and reviewing the outstanding recommendations of this report will be an important part of this.\"\n\nThe interior ministry could not immediately comment.\n\nThe British Association of Beauty Therapy and Cosmetology (BABTAC) said there was an urgent need for regulation, ideally by an independent industry body.\n\nBABTAC, which launched a campaign two years ago with Unseen to raise awareness of exploitation in nail bars, said it would also like to see a mandatory code and labour inspections.\n\nBut others said there was no need for an independent body.\n\nEmily Kenway, senior adviser for the charity Focus on Labour Exploitation, called for more investment in labour inspections.\n\n\"Some people will think we should have a stamp, but it isn't the solution,\" said Kenway. \"We need to fund labour inspection properly and we need to stop criminalising undocumented people.\"\n\nShe said criminalisation prevented trafficking victims seeking help for fear of arrest and deportation - which played into the hands of their exploiters and hampered efforts to tackle the issue.\n\nTell-tale indicators of exploitation in nail bars include unfeasibly low prices, workers who appear very young or are unwilling to make eye contact, and overbearing managers who insist on taking the money.\n\nWomen questioned on the streets in London said they were aware that exploitation was an issue in nail bars.", "description": "The deaths of 39 migrants found in a refrigerated truck in Britain has reignited calls for efforts to tackle slavery in the nail bar sector, a common destination for trafficked Vietnamese.
