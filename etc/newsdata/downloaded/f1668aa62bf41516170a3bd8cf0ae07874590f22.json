To actually come out with it and go into huge detail about all those things, to be honest, is a bit beneath me.\n\n\"I have maybe a wider sexual taste than most people, but that\u2019s as far as I\u2019m going to go.\"\n\nWhat becomes clear in the autobiography is that sex is a subject that Freddie has spoken about a lot and is something that is dominant in his life.\n\n(Image: ullstein bild via Getty Images)\n\nWhen it came to falling in love though, this was a different story and he admitted: \"I couldn\u2019t fall in love with a man the way I could with a girl.\"\n\nWhen it came to loving a woman, the most dominant force in his life was Mary Austin.\n\nFreddie explained: \"Our love affair ended in tears, but a deep bond grew out of it, and that\u2019s something nobody can take away from us.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"It\u2019s unreachable. People always ask me about sexuality and all those things, right from the early days, but I couldn\u2019t fall in love with a man the same way as I have with Mary.\n\n\"All my lovers asked me why they couldn\u2019t replace Mary, but it\u2019s simply impossible.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
