Academy operates 250 stores in 16 states.\n\nFor civilians Colt suspends AR-15 production for civilians\n\nJamal Alsaffar, an attorney representing the victims' families, said they expect federal officials to scrutinize Academy's gun sales for instances of other prohibited firearm purchases.\n\nHe also noted the findings of a government report released last year showing the U.S. Air Force failed on six separate occasions to report information that could have prevented Kelley, an ex-airman, from purchasing a gun. The Department of Defense inspector general's report detailed Kelley's decade-long history of violence, interest in guns and menacing behavior toward women. Kelley, who served nearly five years in the Air Force, was court-martialed and sentenced to one year of confinement for assaulting his wife and stepson.\n\n\"The federal government can't shirk its responsibility for its systematic and decades-long failure to report violent criminals to the FBI background check system,\" Alsaffar said Thursday. \"Because the bottom line is that if the federal government followed the law, the shooter never would've gotten his hands on those weapons. But both things can be true at the same time. The government failed these families and so did Academy.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old Kelley fired at least 450 rounds at congregants in the attack that also left 20 people injured. A man living nearby shot and wounded Kelley, who fled in a vehicle and later shot himself to death, authorities have said. Sutherland Springs is southeast of San Antonio.", "description": "Shooter presented a driver's license from Colorado, where the sale of the rifle would have been illegal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/17/1b38da62-2215-46ff-8136-c05c1255b855/thumbnail/1200x630/a0076d6809cbad900fab1bc565051010/gettyimages-872644172.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
