At the end of the day we've got to all be better.\n\n\"They didn't do anything unusual, they played their defense well. We didn't really have any of the ball early on, got ourselves down. They didn't do anything out of the ordinary, we've got to be better, early in the game especially.\n\n\"It sucks, we have to fix it. Especially the way we've played, back-to-back, there's things we've got to fix but I'm confident we can fix them and get it going in the right direction.\"\n\nWentz, however, does believe the defeats will help unify the Eagles' roster.\n\n\"I love the locker room, you never want to lose but I think it's going to pull us together. It'll make us look in the mirror individually but it'll pull us together as a group,\" Wentz added.\n\n\"I know what we're all capable of, I know if we stay together we can bounce back. We had a rough night, we're going to own it and move on.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We're going to rebound from it and I'm confident we'll be alright.\"\n\nWhile echoing Wentz's suggestion that the whole team need to improve, Eagles coach Doug Pederson insisted it was his responsibility to turn results around.\n\n\"I had a lot of confidence in this football team, a lot of trust and faith in the guys, a good week of preparation,\" he told a news conference.\n\n\"After a game like this we all have to take a step back and look in the mirror, especially for me. This is one of those games I take personally and from that point we didn't play well, that's on me and I've got to get it fixed.\"", "description": "The Philadelphia Eagles slumped to back-to-back NFL defeats with a dismal loss to the Dallas Cowboys, to the embarrassment of Carson Wentz.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LL_TCdQIvDl23C7.H14duQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QjIhasBh9fzyzjUzN7n2qg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/65aa9d4b1316f52d60acabea2161eab3", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
