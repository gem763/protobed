The waving-through of the free trade agreements showed signs of a new pro-reform direction. But old political habits die hard.\n\nOn the day of Mr Albanese\u2019s \"headland\" speech on jobs, a Labor frontbencher preferred to flick the switch back to reflexive populism. In response to Liberal senator Dean Smith\u2019s opinion article in yesterday\u2019s The Australian Financial Review endorsing the NSW government\u2019s plan for productivity-enhancing tax reform that aims to promote more higher-paying jobs, Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers tweeted: \u201cSays it all: when wages are stagnant, pensions and super are a risk, and multinationals aren\u2019t paying their fair share, Liberals now want to jack up the GST so that those families, workers and pensioners who can least afford it are hit the hardest.\u201d Dr Chalmer\u2019s cheap-shot cheer chasing is the kind of political opportunism that has done so much damage to the national reform conversation in the past decade. And Scott Morrison played his role in ruling it all out.
