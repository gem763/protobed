By most accounts, Turkey\u2019s president bamboozled Donald Trump into giving a green light for an invasion of north-east Syria.\n\nYet now, having got what he wanted, Erdo\u011fan faces some difficult choices. How far to go? Who is the enemy? And how long can such a big operation be sustained? It may be the biggest gamble yet by a politician known for taking risks.\n\nWorried about biting off more than they can chew, Turkey\u2019s representatives are busily redefining and repurposing the military incursion, which began with a series of air strikes on Wednesday. What Erdo\u011fan has for months described as an essential move to eliminate a Kurdish terrorist threat has suddenly been transformed into a \u201cpeace operation\u201d primarily targeting Islamic State.\n\nDonald Trump has handed over Isis fight in Syria, Turkey says, as offensive looms Read more\n\n\u0130brahim Kal\u0131n, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s right-hand man, referring to the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, told CNN: \u201cThis is not a move against the Kurds. Turkey doesn\u2019t have any problem with the Kurds. We are fighting [a] terrorist organisation that has killed and oppressed the Kurdish people as well.\u201d As for the main task of fighting Isis, the world should be grateful to Turkey, he suggested.\n\nIt\u2019s plain this abrupt change of tack was influenced by the uproar in Washington that followed Trump\u2019s decision. Even normally sycophantic Republicans accused the White House of betraying Kurdish-led forces that hitherto spearheaded the anti-Isis fight. It\u2019s possible Trump gave Erdo\u011fan the go-ahead in order to distract attention from the impeachment inquiry. If so, his ruse backfired.\n\nTurkey has also changed its tune about long-term territorial ambitions in Syria, notwithstanding Erdo\u011fan\u2019s stated intention to create a quasi-permanent \u201csafe zone\u201d potentially 20 miles deep and 300 miles long (32km and 483km). \u201cTurkey has no interest in occupying any part of Syria,\u201d said Kal\u0131n, characterising previous cross-border operations in Jarablus and Afrin as mere temporary landgrabs.\n\nFahrettin Altun, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s director of communications, meanwhile offered assurances that humanitarian considerations were uppermost. \u201cThe plan helps Turkey shelter innocent people,\u201d he wrote in the Washington Post. Up to 2 million Syrian refugees now in Turkey would \u201cvolunteer\u201d to live in the safe zone, he added \u2013 even though most do not have a prior connection with the area.\n\nKal\u0131n also claimed a mass repatriation would take place voluntarily, not under duress, although nobody seems to have asked the people concerned and aid agencies are highly sceptical.\n\nAs he prepares to send in the troops, Erdo\u011fan face multiple unknowns. One is whether Turkey has the capacity, let alone the will, to lead the charge against Isis or take control of the detention and refugee camps presently guarded by the Kurds. Ankara is already being blamed in some quarters for jeopardising the fight against Isis.\n\nLike everybody else, Erdo\u011fan has no idea which way Trump may jump next. Similar doubts apply to Russia, which is reportedly supportive but recently clashed with Turkey over operations in Idlib, and to Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Iranian-backed regime in Damascus, which may use the confusion to recapture territory and insert its own forces.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the Turkish public, already disillusioned with Erdo\u011fan and beset by deepening economic woes, will make of a costly, open-ended conflict that will look to many like an unnecessary war of choice. And if the dire humanitarian consequences predicted by the UN come to pass, Erdo\u011fan surely knows he will bear the blame internationally \u2013 and face possible US and EU sanctions.\n\nFor all these reasons, Erdo\u011fan will probably tread cautiously at first. He may use Turkish-backed militia fighters from Syria\u2019s rebel National Army, supported from the air, rather than regular Turkish troops in any initial deployment. Reports on Wednesday said the rebels were moving into position. US officials predict there will be no large-scale invasion and any first advance may be limited to establishing combat posts inside Syria.\n\nOnly now fully aware, perhaps, of the dangers \u2013 personal, political and military \u2013 of his high-risk Syria gamble, Erdo\u011fan can be expected to use a White House meeting with Trump on 13 November to try to shore up US support, possibly before making any definitive move. Yet what happens next may be beyond his control. Kurdish leaders insist there will be no retreat. If the Turks come, they say, they will take the fight to them.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s president faces some difficult choices after being given green light by the US", "authors": ["Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6431a16d8f68070bd35888200036db05a95296b/161_0_5850_3512/master/5850.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d3612568c33cf93d9917e0707fda4f1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
