Vice-President Mike Pence defended his boss\u2019s statement, arguing that the voting public deserves nothing less than full transparency about its leaders\u2019 potential conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cI think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president during the last administration,\u201d Pence told reporters in Arizona. \u201cThe president made it very clear that he believes other nations around the world should look into it as well.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s position here is, apparently, that the prospect of a White House shaping foreign policy around the personal financial interests of its leadership is so antithetical to democratic values, it is worth exhaustively investigating even the slightest hint of such corruption, even in a circumstance where:\n\n\u2022 The alleged corruption involves a vice-president supporting a foreign policy that was also endorsed by America\u2019s national-security Establishment, and bipartisan congressional leadership.\n\n\u2022 The vice-president vehemently denies having had a conflict of interest in the matter.\n\n\u2022 The potential corruption is years old, and thus, does not pose any risk of undermining current policy.\n\n\u2022 The method for achieving transparency on the issue involves using America\u2019s limited diplomatic capital to coerce foreign governments into investigating the existing president\u2019s political rival, a measure that itself gives off an aura of corruption.\n\nClearly, then, Pence takes the threat of a U.S. administration pursuing a \u201cfor-profit\u201d foreign policy fanatically seriously. So, surely, if the current president made a foreign-policy decision that was roundly opposed by America\u2019s national-security Establishment and bipartisan congressional leadership \u2014 and which benefited a country where said president has, by his own account, \u201ca little conflict of interest\u201d \u2014 Pence would, at the very least, call on the commander-in-chief to release his tax returns, right?\n\nAfter all, in such a scenario, the stakes of \u2014 and evidence for \u2014 the alleged act of corruption would be much greater than in the Ukraine-Biden controversy. And the method for achieving greater transparency would be essentially costless: Instead of siccing foreign governments on a domestic political foe, Trump would merely need to uphold a decades-old \u201cgood government\u201d norm.\n\nSo (unless Pence is a shameless toady who believes in little beyond his own right to power) expect the veep to flip out when he finally gets around to reading about Trump\u2019s new policy in Syria \u2014 and pair of towers in Istanbul.\n\nShortly after speaking to Turkey\u2019s authoritarian president Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday, Trump endorsed \u201ca Turkish military operation that would sweep away American-backed Kurdish forces near the border in Syria.\u201d In defiance of the will of the Pentagon, State Department, and both houses of Congress, the president agreed to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northeast Syria, leaving our nation\u2019s Kurdish allies defenseless against an invading army that considers them \u201cterrorists\u201d on the basis of little more than their ethnicity.\n\nIn the days since, the White House\u2019s position has grown more ambiguous. On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted his support of both the Turkish government and the Kurds \u2014 complimenting the former for the grace it displayed in releasing an American pastor it had baselessly imprisoned.\n\nRegardless, Trump\u2019s initial, renegade policy raises questions about whether unsavory personal motives are influencing some of the most consequential decisions his office empowers him to make. The basis of this suspicion is simple: Donald Trump has a significant conflict of interest in his dealings with Turkey.\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it, take Trump\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI have a little conflict of interest \u2018cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d Trump told Steve Bannon during a December 2015 interview on Breitbart\u2019s radio show. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendously successful job. It\u2019s called Trump Towers \u2014 two towers, instead of one, not the usual one, it\u2019s two.\u201d\n\nCritically, Trump does not actually own these towers. Rather, he licenses his brand to the building\u2019s owner, Turkish tycoon Aydin Dogan, an ally of Erdogan. This arrangement may actually leave our president more vulnerable to extortion from the Turkish regime than if he owned the towers outright. According to Trump\u2019s financial disclosures, he has collected between $3.2 million and $17 million in royalties from the licensing deal since 2012. This means that Trump could ostensibly lose millions of dollars, should Dogan terminate their partnership. Which is to say: The president could have a multimillion-dollar motivation to avoid pursuing any policy that might incur Dogan\u2019s wrath. Notably, the prospect that Dogan might leverage his business relationship with Trump to influence his policies isn\u2019t a mere hypothetical. As Russ Choma of Mother Jones explains:\n\nIn June 2016, after Trump said he supported a ban on immigration by people from countries he said were associated with Islamic terrorism \u2014 he called them \u201cterror countries\u201d \u2014 Erdogan objected, and so did Dogan, and both threatened to remove Trump\u2019s name from the buildings.\n\n\u2026 Less than a month after the threat to remove his name was made, Trump very publicly voiced support for Erdogan when the Turkish leader faced a coup attempt. And his closeness with Erdogan has continued, even over the objections of some of Trump\u2019s most reliable supporters. For instance, in May 2017, when Erdogan visited Washington, D.C., for a White House visit, Turkish agents violently attacked protesters outside the Turkish ambassador\u2019s residence \u2014 shoving past local police officers to do so. Video showed Erdogan calmly watching the attack from his car. Although the House of Representatives, then under GOP control, voted 397-0 to condemn the attacks, Trump refused to do so. A few months later, Trump praised Erdogan, describing him as \u201ca very good friend\u201d and saying he gets \u201cvery high marks\u201d for the way he runs Turkey.\n\nPresented with this set of facts, Mike Pence would doubtlessly conclude that the American people have a right to know the precise nature and extent of their president\u2019s financial interests in Turkey. His call for the release of Trump\u2019s tax returns should drop any minute now.", "description": "Donald Trump has a major conflict of interest in setting U.S. policy toward Turkey in Syria: He collects millions in royalties from a licensing agreement in Istanbul \u2014 a deal that an ally of Turkish president Erdogan could cancel at any time.", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/08/08-erdogan-trump.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
