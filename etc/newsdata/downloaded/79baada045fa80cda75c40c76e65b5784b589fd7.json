Miguel Rojas said the Marlins will take all the good vibes they can get as they try to build toward a better season in 2020.\n\nThe 30-year-old Rojas had a career-high six RBIs, including a crucial three-run double , and Miami rallied past the Arizona Diamondbacks 12-6 on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about who wants to be here in this clubhouse and who wants to be part of what we\u2019re doing here in Miami,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for everybody to start playing for their job for next year.\u201d\n\nThe Marlins pounded 17 hits to beat Arizona for the fourth time in six tries this year.\n\nThe Diamondbacks\u2018 slim playoff hopes took another hit with the loss: They\u2019re 5 \u00bd games behind the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers for the second NL wild-card spot with 10 to play.\n\nThe Diamondbacks led 4-2 after five innings. Left-hander Alex Young had a solid start, giving up two runs. Matt Andriese (5-5) came on in relief and gave up three runs - all with two outs in the sixth - when Rojas hit his bases-clearing double that barely stayed inside the left-field line.\n\nThe Marlins extended their lead to 10-4 in the seventh with five more runs. Miami sent nine batters to the plate during the rally, which was capped by Rojas\u2019 two-run single. Arizona\u2019s Jimmie Sherfy gave up all five runs without recording an out, and his ERA spiked from 2.51 to 5.65.\n\n\u201cIt was good to get some offense going, score some runs,\u201d Miami manager Don Mattingly said. \u201cYou get late, and you\u2019re still not comfortable. So all the runs you can get, you feel good about getting.\u201d\n\nCaleb Smith (9-10) got the win, giving up four runs over five innings. Bryan Holaday had three hits, including his fourth homer of the season. Rojas had three doubles - in the third, sixth and ninth innings - and finished with four hits.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk about me today,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cIt was a great team win. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the guys, the way we played the game today.\u201d\n\nKevin Cron hit a pinch-hit, solo homer for the Diamondbacks. It was his sixth in the big leagues. He hit 39 homers in the minors this season, mostly at Triple-A Reno.\n\nThe Diamondbacks had 13 hits, but the team\u2019s relievers had a tough time getting outs.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t make pitches,\u201d Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute a good game plan and we made mistakes in the middle of the zone. When pitchers make mistakes over the middle of the plate, big-league hitters will take advantage of that.\u201d\n\nBONK\n\nChristian Walker was hit by a pitch in the first inning. It was the 67th time that\u2019s happened to a Diamondbacks player this season, which tied a club record.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMarlins: Starting C Jorge Alfaro was hit on his non-throwing hand by Ildemaro Vargas\u2019 bat in the first inning. Alfaro stayed in the game for the rest of the inning, but was replaced by Holaday in the second. The Marlins called the injury a contusion and Mattingly said after the game that an X-ray was negative.\n\nDiamondbacks: CF Ketel Marte left the game in the fifth inning with back stiffness. He was 2 for 2 with a double before the injury. Lovullo said Marte would have \u201cprecautionary MRI\u201d on Wednesday. \u2026 SS Nick Ahmed was scratched from the lineup a few hours before the game because of an injured finger on his throwing hand, which he hurt in Monday\u2019s game. He is day-to-day. \u2026 RHP Luke Weaver (forearm tightness) threw a bullpen on Tuesday and Lovullo said Weaver might throw in a game before the end of the season on Sept. 29.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarlins: Miami will start RHP Sandy Alcantara (5-13, 3.93) on Wednesday.\n\nDiamondbacks: Arizona RHP Mike Leake (11-11, 4.39) will start. He\u2019s 2-1 with a 2.08 ERA over his last four starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Miami Marlins have had a forgettable season and will almost certainly barrel past the 100-loss mark before the end of September.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/marlins_diamondbacks_baseball_35262_c0-129-3070-1918_s1770x1032.jpg?270b5f6cd7a304ceabbbc093de2f44caeec856fd", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
