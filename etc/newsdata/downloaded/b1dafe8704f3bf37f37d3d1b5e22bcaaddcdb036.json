Intellectual-property theft, he added, remains an issue that must be resolved.\n\nMr. Trump dismissed the trade war with China, widely cited as an important factor in the global economic slowdown, as \u201ca little spat\u201d and reiterated his respect for China\u2019s President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments came as U.S. and Chinese officials were holding midlevel meetings in Washington, according to a spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The deputy-level officials were working Thursday and Friday to set the agenda for talks planned with Mr. Lighthizer and other senior officials next month. \u201cThese discussions were productive, and the United States looks forward to welcoming a delegation from China for principal-level meetings in October,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s office said in a statement Friday. \u201cThese trade talks are tough,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who has followed the discussions closely. \u201cNot surprising, we\u2019re going to have twists and turns, but our attention is on the high-level principal talks in October and we hope then we will see progress.\u201d Business leaders hope to see progress in the talks over coming weeks that could lead Mr. Trump to further delay or scrap plans for both a five-percentage-point hike in some U.S. tariff levels in October and the launch in December of major new tariffs on consumer goods imported from China. On Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said China\u2019s delegates were planning to visit U.S. farms after talks in Washington concluded, adding that it wasn\u2019t clear whether their plans suggested they were going to announce U.S. agricultural purchases. CNBC reported Friday that the Chinese trade negotiators would head back to China after the talks and were no longer planning to visit farms in Montana and elsewhere. \u201cThey are not coming to Montana,\u201d said a woman who answered the phone at the Montana Farm Bureau. \u201cThey have changed their travel plans and are heading home.\u201d Mr. Trump has used tariffs and economic threats to maintain pressure on China. Some administration officials are wary of Beijing seeking to erode U.S. support for the trade war by making overtures to American businesses and farmers who benefit from trade with China.
