But the 66-year-old son of an east London lorry driver, who lives in Mauritius, started his career at Barclays where he developed an interest in stock analysis. He was fired from his position as head of UK company research at UBS for writing a best-selling but controversial book, Accounting For Growth, which analysed how British businesses cooked the books to appear more successful. He joined stockbroker Collins Stewart and became chief executive in 2000 after leading a management buyout. He acquired Tullett Liberty in 2003, and Prebon Group in 2004, before demerging Collins Stewart from the newly formed Tullett Prebon in 2006. In 2010 he set up Fundsmith, and four years later quit Tullett Prebon. His flagship Fundsmith Equity fund looks after almost \u00a318billion of savers\u2019 money.\n\nRather than condemning this behaviour, the senior manager said: 'It's f*****g great news but I don't want to know about it either.'\n\nSmith, now a successful fund manager at his firm Fundsmith, formed Tullett Prebon when his business Collins Stewart acquired Tullett Liberty and then Prebon Group.\n\nHe was chief executive of the firm from the time it combined in 2004 until 2014.\n\nTullett Prebon is an inter-dealer broker, meaning it negotiates deals between investment banks and other big financial institutions.\n\nIts rates division carried out 'name-passing' broking, where the broker negotiates deals between parties at mutually acceptable terms and then passes their names to each other to conclude the transaction.\n\nThe FCA found the division had ineffective controls which allowed brokers to complete wash trades \u2013 where there is no actual change in who owns the asset, and the trade has no purpose other than to mislead the market or enrich the broker.\n\nTullett Prebon brokers were paid bonuses depending on the amount of brokerage they brought in, and this could exceed their salaries by several times.\n\nThe FCA criticised senior managers at Tullett Prebon for turning a blind eye, and for encouraging the culture of lavish entertainment to build relationships with traders.\n\nMost of the \u00a315.4million fine was a punishment for the poor trading practice, although \u00a34.9million was slapped on because Tullett Prebon initially failed to give the FCA voice recordings which it requested to aid with its investigation.\n\nNicolas Breteau, chief executive TP Icap, said: 'We are pleased to put this historical matter behind us.\n\nNone of the individuals involved in the relevant broking activities remain with our firm, which has long since taken the opportunity to significantly enhance its systems and controls to comply with regulatory expectations.'\n\nSmith declined to comment.", "description": "Tullett Prebon, now a part of TP Icap, was found by the Financial Conduct Authority to have ineffective controls around broker conduct in its rates division between 2008 and 2010.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
