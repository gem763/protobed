On the night, what happened behind the scenes provided the greatest plot twist of all.\n\nIn a deliberate flouting of the rules, the jury decided to split the prize between two books, Atwood\u2019s The Testaments and Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other.\n\nTold in no uncertain terms that the rulebook allowed only one winner, the chair of the judges, Peter Florence, refused to give way.\n\nIt culminated in a a bizarre press conference in which Florence announced the decision while the exasperated director of the prize, Gaby Wood, stood by.\n\n\u201cThey have actively broken the rules. It\u2019s not that we accommodated the jury, it\u2019s that the jury actively chose to reject the rules,\u201d explained Wood. \u201cThey effectively staged a sit-in in the judging room.\u201d", "description": "The big question before this year\u2019s Booker Prize announcement was whether Margaret Atwood\u2019s thriller would win.", "authors": ["Anita Singh", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000213027728_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYG-7GzYVtFQSFAHuTMXOjMURJANpZ1zkxuc6RWrdsSY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
