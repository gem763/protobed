Needless to say, the photo ops taken prior to the meeting painstakingly showed the smiles on both sides crunching their teeth. So much has been said and done over the past few weeks leading up to this round of talks, one wonders why they even met in the first place? I suppose that is politics and the art of diplomacy -- look your enemy in the eye, lie straight out, smile and then walk away do whatever you always wanted to do. I shall stick to portfolio management, thank you very much.\n\nThis week of events have been nothing short of a domestic quarrel, but between two of the world's biggest superpowers -- it is quite embarrassing, actually. Prior to the meeting, the U.S. blacklisted eight Chinese AI entities followed by visa restrictions on some members involved in Human Rights accusations. Great way to start a negotiation.\n\nThe Chinese side maintained that they are sincere and have come with ideas to garner a deal, open to only discussing buying more agricultural and energy products and Intellectual Property rights. Any demands of addressing their foreign subsidy laws and changing domestic policy was off the table. Trump kept reiterating that if he signs a deal, it will only be a \"big\" one. What China was offering was not good enough for Trump and the Chinese delegation decided to leave one day early. Not entirely sure but the U.S. probably threw an olive branch and whispers of a partial deal circulated and now the Vice Premier Liu He has decided to stay till the end of Friday.\n\nThe market and the economy is getting tired of these senseless Trade Wars that Trump started in July 2018. Nothing has come of it other than violent market volatility and some seriously dubious tweets allowing one to wonder if the President spends more time on his Twitter than he does in the Oval office doing some \"actual\" work. The helm of the U.S. economy is in the hands of a man who wakes up one morning and decides to u-turn foreign policy making of his own decisions, and firing those who do not see his way. Maybe the constitution needs to be re-written up after Trump presidency. He has figured out a loophole to tweak the entire economic system using the dollar as a weapon against the world and coercing the Fed to start increasing their balance sheet again and consider launching round 4 of Quantitative Easing (oh please, but let's not call it QE, as this is different).\n\nThe time is drawing closer to his re-election prospects and Trump needs something to take the public's eyes off the impeachment and various other scandals. He needs a win. Even if it means buying some more soya beans or pork, which China was always prepared to do in the first place, he will claim it as a \"huge\" win for himself -- and the market will cheer as they feel the worst is over. U.S. Manufacturing PMI and economic data has been deteriorating quite fast over the past few months as the U.S. has finally caught the cold the rest of the world is trying to recover from. It needs a deal more than China, as the latter can afford to wait it out.\n\nTrump is to meet with Liu He this afternoon, and tweeted \"talks are going very well\" last night. That is all the market needed to move towards 2950. Various media reports suggest that the U.S. has offered to hold off the extension of trade tariffs starting from October 15 in exchange for a currency pact of some sort. Not sure if computers are programmed to recall history, but in the 1980s this is exactly what Japan agreed to via the Plaza Accord, which ruined their economy as the yen spiked. Still today, the Japanese economy has not recovered from its woes. China will certainly not make the same mistake. Also, even if they agree to a deal to get the tariffs off their back, can the U.S. or anyone actually monitor what China is or is not going to do with their FX markets? Good luck to anyone who can convince them to show their books.\n\nTrump has always maintained that he would press China on the hard issues like changing their government subsidy program that makes China's companies more competitive, and forced technology transfers -- the game-changer deal. It seems he is addressing neither as promised to his people. Nothing has changed.\n\nFor now, markets are optimistic, as they have signs of yet another deal -- for the 167th time -- and a Fed who is willing to start QE if things go belly up. Over the next few weeks, third quarter 2019 earnings will be in full swing, and the quarter is expected to show a -5% year-over-year earnings decline, for the third straight quarter. If that is not the definition of a recession, I'm not sure what is. The conference calls and growth outlooks will not be pretty, yet the stocks are trading at all-time highs.\n\nLet's wait and see what this afternoon brings us. The financial system is in serious trouble, as seen by the repo market shortfall. Leverage loan defaults are picking up, as $40 billion of a $1.2 trillion-dollar market are trading on mere cents on the dollar. The economic cycle is unable to see any further earnings growth. Unless something drastically changes allowing us to tweak our earnings higher, this rally is set to disappoint us yet again.\n\nEnough theatrics, back to fundamentals.", "description": "Trump needs a deal, but the Chinese haven't budged on what they are offering.", "authors": ["Maleeha Bengali", "Trump Says Talks Are Going Well", "The Machines Buy It -- Again", "Enough Theatrics", "Back To Fundamentals.", "Bruce Kamich", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "James", "Rev Shark", "Paul Price"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/5ef10338-765d-11e9-9035-8d2ec4f14b44.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
