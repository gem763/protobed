In reality, the figure is higher, migration officers say, because many entered the country illegally.\n\nIn other circumstances, living abroad could be any child\u2019s dream. But this generation is suffering \u201can immense grieving,\u201d according to Sandra Perdomo, director of the Zion foundation which provides assistance to at-risk children.\n\nMost of them don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to them and worse, \u201cthey\u2019ve lost all hope, they are no longer children.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Stateless \u2013\n\nIn the final two weeks of her pregnancy, Yisela Palencia crossed the border into Colombia illegally.\n\nThe hospitals in her own country, for all its previous oil wealth, lacks medicine and reliable hospital equipment.\n\nSo taking her other two children, aged eight and five, with her, Palencia headed to Colombia via the smuggling trails that criss-cross the border and rejoined her exiled husband in Bogota.\n\nBut the birth of Wilbelys did not bring the joy the couple had hoped for. A legal void has made the baby\u2019s first months a bureaucratic nightmare.\n\nShe is unable to benefit from her parent\u2019s nationality, because there is no Venezuelan consular service in Colombia. But she cannot have Colombian nationality either as Bogota does not recognize the right of citizenship through birth in the country.\n\n\u201cMy daughter has no homeland. She is not recognized here in Colombia or Venezuela,\u201d said Palencia, 32. \u201cOfficially, she doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThere are 24,000 children like Wilbelys in Colombia. President Ivan Duque signed a decree in August allowing them to benefit from Colombian nationality.\n\nPalencia thought the problems were over for her daughter, who turned a year old in August, but the registry told her it her case could not be settled until December.\n\nThe United Nations has identified four million stateless persons in 78 countries around the world, who frequently suffer discrimination in accessing basic rights to healthcare and education.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get to decide where we are born and children have nothing to do with what happens,\u201d said her mother.\n\n\u2013 Homeless \u2013\n\nArianna Celis wears a different uniform to her classmates, one month after entering Augustin Fernandez School in northern Bogota.\n\nSince leaving the Venezuelan city of Los Teques in 2014, she has moved seven times in Colombia as her father Carlos can only find short-term work as a butcher.\n\nThe shy little six-year-old only wants one thing. To stay in the same place.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether we are coming or going,\u201d said Maria Escalona, Arianna\u2019s mother. \u201cIf these changes continues as she grows, this will affect her.\u201d\n\nAt 39, Maria dreams of \u201cproviding stability, a little house, a quality of life,\u201d to her girls.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason we came to Colombia,\u201d she said in the family home, which for now is a tiny apartment.\n\nAccording to child psychologist Jhon Herrera, children like Arianna live with constant \u201cgrief\u201d because of the material and cultural losses they experience as refugees. \u201cThey are even likely to suffer post-traumatic stress.\u201d\n\n\u2013 School-less \u2013\n\nAt 13, Jazmin Gonzalez has to kill time every day watching TV when she should be at school.\n\nThe secondary school near her home requested a health certificate to enroll her, which as an undocumented person she could not provide.\n\nColombia guarantees unrestricted access to education. But some institutions ignore the legislation when dealing with poor migrants who are unaware of their rights.\n\nFor her part, Jazmin would like to return to Venezuela because in Colombia \u201cshe has nothing to do.\u201d\n\nChildren \u201care not guilty over what is happening in Venezuela,\u201d said her mother, Elizabeth Gonzalez.\n\nPerdomo, the expert from the Zion Foundation, says Venezuela\u2019s child migrants are suffering \u201cgreat sadness.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wilbelys\u2019 mother, Yisela Palencia: \u201cThey are losing their childhood.\u201d", "description": "Bogota (AFP) \u2013 Stateless baby Wilbelys officially \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Arianna is a six-year-old who\u2019s moved home seven times,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/4d3d85_venezuelan-yisela-palencia-poses-her-children-in-bogota-colombia-children-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
