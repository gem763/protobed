USA TODAY\n\nDee Carter of Aurora, Colo., parked his big rig by the side of the 118 Freeway in Los Angeles to wait out the massive traffic jam caused by the Saddleridge Fire that as of Friday morning had already consumed 4,700 acres in northwest Los Angeles County.\n\nHe was one of hundreds of truckers waylaid by wind-driven wildfires, unable to get past highway patrol checkpoints on some of the region\u2019s busiest interstates and freeways, including the 5, 405, 210, 118.\n\nThe main thoroughfares used by both commuters and truckers, and connecting Southern California to the rest of the state were closed by the fires, cutting off highway access through Los Angeles and jamming surface streets.\n\nOnly the 101 Freeway remained completely open to drivers coming from the Central Valley or Bay Area.\n\nUPDATE #SaddleridgeFire current closures:\n\nSB 5 at Calgrove Bl\n\nNB 5 at Rte 118\n\nSB 14 at Newhall\n\nWB 210 at 118\n\nNB 405 at 118\n\nEB 118 connector to WB 210\n\nEB 118 connector to NB 405\n\nNB/SB 5 to EB 118\n\n\n\nSee https://t.co/O37Qesrybo\n\n\n\nPhoto: I-5/State Route 14 interchange today pic.twitter.com/XWuTKDuHip \u2014 Caltrans District 7 (@CaltransDist7) October 11, 2019\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s packages are going to be late,\" Carter said wistfully, noting that he was hauling Amazon deliveries from a warehouse in Fontana, Calif., on the way to Sacramento.\n\nIn the hour that he had been idle, Carter said he had been busy trying to reroute his way around the closures. No luck. Instead, just as he was settling down to make steak and eggs in his sleeper cab for breakfast, the freeway reopened.\n\nA ramp to the 5 Freeway in Pacoima is closed Friday, Oct. 11, 2019.

He had been stuck by the side of the freeway since 4 a.m. He was trying to get an empty shipping container to Bakersfield, Calif., about 90 miles north.\n\n\u201cThey stopped it right there,\u201d he said, nodding toward the traffic backup in front of him. \u201cMy plan is to wait until they open the freeway.\u201d A few minutes later, they did and the truckers took off. But in other areas across the busy Los Angeles highway system, many would have to continue waiting.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately with how [the trucks are] are, they can\u2019t take some of the two-lane roads because they can\u2019t navigate them,\u201d says California Highway Patrol Officer Josh Greengard, adding that Interstate 5, both northbound and southbound, was still closed, along with parts of the 210 Freeway, the 118 Freeway, and smaller highways connecting them.\n\nThe Saddleridge fire comes across the mountains near Chatsworth and Highway 118 on Friday, Oct. 11, 2019. Commuters used the Santa Susana Pass Road near Simi Valley because portions of Highway 118 was closed. (Photo: JUAN CARLO/THE STAR)\n\nCommuters trying to navigate the Friday morning traffic, typically heavy at this time of day, were being re-routed to smaller two-lane roads too narrow for trucks to pass through.\n\nAmy Chaverri and her son were on their way from Disneyland back home to Rancho Cordova near Sacramento when her navigation app rerouted her off the northbound Interstate 5 and onto a surface street in Pacoima.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because I had been thinking all week \u2018at least we\u2019re not home during the power outage up north\u2019 and then there\u2019s this fire here today. I didn\u2019t even realize there was a fire until we got here and saw the freeway closure.\u201d\n\nGreengard added that CHP is advising drivers to avoid the roads in the area. Even as the flames die down or shift away from the freeway, emergency personnel need access to the throughways and space to ensure they can fight the fire, and the agency is hoping to limit traffic incidents on local roads.\n\nHe said CHP is working to open freeways as soon as possible, but the fast-moving fire continues to be a threat. As of Friday morning, the fire was 0% contained, consuming 800 acres an hour. Nearly 100,000 people are under mandatory evacuations and 13,000 homes are threatened in Southern California's San Fernando Valley.\n\nTwenty-five structures have already been damaged\n\n\u201cIf you can work from home today it\u2019s probably the best thing to do. Or if you can take a vacation day \u2014 I know not a lot of people can do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, logistically, where the fire is at, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to keep the roads open.\u201d\n\nErin Rode of the Ventura County Star contributed to this report.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/11/saddleridge-fire-shuts-down-freeways-creating-traffic-nightmare-la/3944164002/", "description": "California Highway Patrol tells drivers to consider working from home or taking vacation day.", "authors": ["Gabrielle Canon", "Chris Woodyard", "Published P.M.
