REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nCARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela\u2019s state prosecutor\u2019s office said on Friday it would open an investigation into opposition leader Juan Guaido after the interior minister presented photos on state television showing Guaido in the company of two suspected members of a Colombian drug-trafficking group.\n\nGuaido on Friday said the two men had asked to take a photo with him when he secretly crossed into Colombia from Venezuela in February via an informal border route after a Venezuelan court had barred him from leaving the country.\n\nHe denied knowing who the men were. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for their criminal record to take a photo,\u201d he told reporters in Caracas.\n\nVenezuelan Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said on state television that the two men were leaders of a \u201cColombian paramilitary organisation\u201d called the Rastrojos. Reverol said he would send the photos as evidence to the state prosecutor\u2019s office, which later opened the investigation.\n\nColombian police sources confirmed they were members of the Rastrojos, a criminal group made up of ex-paramilitaries that engages in drug trafficking across the country, including along the Venezuelan border.\n\nGuaido crossed into Colombia before a U.S.-backed attempt on Feb. 23 to send trucks loaded with humanitarian aid into Venezuela from the Colombian border town of Cucuta. Maduro, however, had ordered the border\u2019s closure and told the military to block the aid\u2019s entry.\n\nAt the time, it was not clear how Guaido had crossed the border. He appeared at an aid concert by Cucuta on Feb. 22 dressed in the same clothes as he was wearing in the photo with the two men.\n\nGuaido assumed an interim presidency in January after denouncing Maduro as illegitimate for securing a second term last year in an election widely viewed as fraudulent. Most western nations now recognise Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader, though Maduro labels him a coupmongering U.S. puppet.", "description": "Venezuela's state prosecutor's office said on Friday it would open an investigation into opposition leader Juan Guaido after the interior minister presented photos on state television showing Guaido in the company of two suspected members of a Colombian drug-trafficking group.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429550083&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C249", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
