After a series of test maneuvers inside and above [Space Shuttle] Challenger . . . McCandless went 'free flying' to a distance of 320 feet away from the orbiter.\"\n\nThirty years later, the photographs of McCandless' breathtaking, first-ever untethered space walk during the fourth Challenger mission still stun. (McCandless was joined on his historic walk by Col. Robert L. Stewart , but it is the stirring photos of McCandless\u2014made by Challenger 's pilot, Robert \"Hoot\" Gibson\u2014that have endured.)\n\nMcCandless was a Navy aviator in the early 1960s\u2014he graduated second in the Naval Academy's class of 1958, earning a master's degree in electrical engineering\u2014and in 1966 was one of 19 fliers selected by NASA for astronaut training. He was instrumental in designing and testing the MMU jet pack, and for 18 years before the Challenger mission that would, in a sense, immortalize him, McCandless played a role in some of NASA's greatest triumphs: he was, for example, the Capsule Communicator, or CAPCOM, during the Apollo 11 mission.\n\nForty-five years after Apollo 11's lunar mission, it's only right that we take a minute to celebrate another astonishing, hair-raising NASA first. Namely, that moment, 15 years after Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon, when McCandless briefly broke free, at-once minuscule and momentous\u2014the human form sharply etched and intrepid against the limitless, indifferent void.", "description": "LIFE.com celebrates incredible photos of astronaut Bruce McCandless taken during the first \"untethered space walk\" in history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/140715-bruce-mccandless-1984-2-feat.jpg?w=720", "published_at": "2014-08-26"}
