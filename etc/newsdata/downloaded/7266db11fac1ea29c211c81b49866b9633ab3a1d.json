They have all suffered trauma as a result of their childhood abuse.\n\n'They have all shown immense courage in coming forward to assist the investigation and support the prosecution case.'\n\nZaman and Hussain, both of Huddersfield, Fikru, who is in custody, and the three other convicted defendants gave no reaction as they were told the jury's verdicts.", "description": "Leeds Crown Court heard how three socially isolated girls were lured into associating with older men before being treated as sexual commodities.
