But in reality, \u201cstalkerware\u201d isn\u2019t as high-tech or inaccessible as we\u2019re led to believe. It\u2019s a tool that can be harnessed as a dangerous weapon, stripping people of their privacy \u2014 especially women in abusive relationships.\n\nStalkerware technology, also known as \u201cspouseware,\u201d takes the form of applications or add-ons to a device that allows someone to remotely monitor another person\u2019s activity. This technology has become increasingly accessible, but yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made its first case against the developers behind three stalking apps \u2014 originally created to monitor children and employees \u2013 that may also be used for illegitimate purposes.\n\nThe Florida-based company Retina-X Studios is no longer permitted to promote its apps unless the creators can provide sufficient evidence that the app isn\u2019t being exploited for more sinister reasons. The apps under investigation include MobileSpy, TeenShield, and PhoneSheriff \u2014 parental surveillance apps, which had sold approximately 15,000 subscriptions before being banned. The apps allowed people to read texts, view photos, and access the GPS location of a phone it had secretly been installed on.\n\n\u201cAlthough there may be legitimate reasons to track a phone, these apps were designed to run surreptitiously in the background and are uniquely suited to illegal and dangerous uses,\u201d Andrew Smith, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.\n\nWhile developers who create these apps are to blame, the responsibility also falls into the hands of Google and Apple to remove these tools from its app stores. The FTC\u2019s report notes that Retina-X apps bypass both Android and iOS security restrictions which allows them to collect sensitive data and expose devices to security vulnerabilities.\n\nIn 2017, Motherboard reported that a hacker targeted Retina-X multiple times. The first hack involved customer data such as the GPS locations of infected phones, as well as photos, text messages, emails, and contacts obtained by the company\u2019s own stalkerware.\n\nThere has been little research on stalkerware or attempts to grasp its true scale, but a 2018 study by researchers at Cornell University found that there are dozens of stalkerware tools easily available on the AppStore. However, the authors warned the majority are \u201cdual use\u201d apps masquerading as child safety or anti-theft tools, which can easily be repurposed for spying on a partner or spouse, such as PhoneSheriff.\n\n\u201cWhile Retina-X claimed in its legal policies that the apps were intended for monitoring employees and children, Retina-X did not take any steps to ensure that its apps were being used for these purposes,\u201d Smith added.\n\nAs \u201cThe Predator in your Pocket\u201d study points out, the availability of stalkerware apps is the result of a broader social condition that either leads developers to believe it\u2019s appropriate to create software designed for stalking or to create surveillance apps that can be easily repurposed to spy on a partner.\n\nTo dodge legal implications, tracking apps use legal disclaimers, discreetly tucked away on their websites, that outline the primary purpose of these apps as \u201cparental surveillance\u201d tools. However, the reality is clearly very different. As tech continues to further embed itself in our daily lives, the law must keep pace with developments and recognize in cases such as this, that apps can have unforeseen consequences that people need to be protected against. The FTC\u2019s first step can only be seen as a step in the right direction.\n\nRead next: CHEAP: Toughen up your data with a 1TB SanDisk External SSD for $179", "description": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made its first case against the developers behind three stalking apps that may also be used for illegitimate purposes.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FWhat-time-is-it_-3-1.png&signature=72fa2cb207b4d55e6f45b730424df384", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
