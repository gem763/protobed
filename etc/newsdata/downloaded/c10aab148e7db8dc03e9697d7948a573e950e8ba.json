They had 19 current and former USA Today sports reporters come up with 60 players ranked in order, and all the lists were put together in order to create a top 100.\n\nHere are some of the biggest snubs from that list. As mentioned by USA Today, the reporters came up with 170 names altogether, so many players below were most likely brought up by at least one of the reporters.\n\nOffense\n\nQuarterback\n\nGeorge Blanda\n\nNot just a quarterback, Blanda also handled the placekicking duties. His 340 games played are the fifth-most all-time.\n\nDan Fouts\n\nSpending his entire 15-year career with the Chargers, Fouts was named to six Pro Bowls and led the NFL in passing yards four times.\n\nJim Kelly\n\nKelly helped guide the Bills to four straight Super Bowls and finished his career with a 101-59 record as the starting quarterback.\n\nWarren Moon\n\nStarting his career as a CFL legend, Moon threw for nearly 50,000 yards and threw 291 touchdown passes in his NFL tenure.\n\nY.A. Tittle\n\nIn 17 seasons, Tittle was named to seven Pro Bowls and was named a First Team All-Pro three times.\n\nRunning back\n\nMarcus Allen\n\nFor his career, Allen ranks 14th all-time in rushing yards (12,243) and third in rushing touchdowns (123).\n\nStill a productive player at the age of 36, Gore\u2019s 15,136 career rushing yards place him just 134 away from surpassing Barry Sanders for the third-most in league history.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

His 1,964 receiving yards in 2012 are the most-ever in a single season.\n\nSteve Largent\n\nWhen he played, offenses weren\u2019t as pass-happy as they are now, but Largent still had seven seasons with 1,000+ yards receiving and found the end zone 100 times via catches.\n\nDon Maynard\n\nMaynard was a member of the Jets\u2019 Super Bowl III-winning team and recorded five seasons with over 1,000 receiving yards.\n\nTight end\n\nMike Ditka\n\nThe first tight end ever inducted into the Hall of Fame, Ditka was a Pro Bowler in each of his first five seasons and was named a First Team All-Pro twice.\n\nOzzie Newsome\n\nProbably the best pass-catching tight end of his era, Newsome twice went over the 1,000 yard receiving mark.\n\nShannon Sharpe\n\nSharpe won three Super Bowls (two with the Broncos, one with the Ravens) and compiled over 10,000 receiving yards in his career.\n\nOffensive line\n\nWillie Roaf\n\nSpending the majority of his career at left tackle, Roaf was named to 11 Pro

major part of some dominant defenses for the Bears, and his 137.5 career sacks place him tied for ninth-most in league history.\n\nChris Doleman\n\nComing in at fifth on the all-time sacks list with 150.5, Doleman had eight seasons of double-digit sacks, including a career-best of 21 in 1989.\n\nKevin Greene\n\nGreene finished two seasons as the league-leader in sacks and finished with 160 in his

generation, Randle was named a First Team All-Pro for six straight seasons spanning from 1993-1998.\n\nWarren Sapp\n\nEqually talented at both rushing the passer and stopping a run game, Sapp won a Super Bowl with the Buccaneers and was named Defensive Player of the Year in 1999.\n\nDeMarcus Ware\n\nWare was quite a handful for opposing offensive linemen and had a five-season stretch from 2007-2011 in which he recorded 80 sacks.\n\nJack Youngblood\n\nUnfortunately, sacks weren\u2019t an official stat until Youngblood\u2019s third-to-last season, but a New York Times article from 2006 mentions that he unofficially tallied 151.5 in his career.\n\nJason Taylor\n\nThe 2006 Defensive Player of the Year, Taylor rushed the passer as very few others have and ended his remarkable career with a robust 139.5 sacks.\n\nBuck Buchanan\n\nIn a 13-year career all spent with the Chiefs, Buchanan made eight straight Pro Bowls from 1964-1971 and was named a First-Team All-Pro each season from

league and finished his career having intercepted 52 passes.\n\nAeneas Williams\n\nIn 14 seasons, Williams intercepted 55 passes and returned nine of them for scores.\n\nDarrelle Revis\n\nKnown for
