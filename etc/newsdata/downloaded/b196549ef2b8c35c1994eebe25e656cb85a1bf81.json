Egypt exited the alliance last year.\n\nIn Washington last week, the Pentagon\u2019s top Middle East policy official, Mick Mulroy, hosted the Middle East Strategic Alliance countries in an effort to organize the group\u2019s security element, urging \u201cwhole of government cooperation across economic, security, energy and political spheres\u201d in the wake of the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi facilities at Abqaiq.\n\nBut after President Trump refused to retaliate against Iran after the Abqaiq strikes and the shootdown of a US drone, former US officials say that Gulf nations are becoming more wary of relying on the Pentagon for protection.\n\nAlso read\n\n\u201cNo sign that GCC can function as a coherent security organization,\u201d said Adam Ereli, a former US ambassador to Bahrain, using an abbreviaton for the Gulf Cooperation Council, which fractured after the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar began in 2017. \u201cTrump\u2019s fecklessness in the face of Iranian aggression has dealt a serious blow to Arab confidence in US as a protecting power.\u201d\n\nEreli described the recent meetings as \u201cvery low-level\u201d and said the US administration may hope to enhance ballistic missile defense, cyber and maritime forces in the region. But Trump\u2019s calls to get European and Arab allies to respond to Iranian provocations have been met with a tepid response.\n\nAl-Monitor recently reported that European nations mostly opted to work with a coalition of EU states to secure oil traffic in the Gulf instead of the American-backed International Maritime Security Construct in an attempt to steer clear of any semblance of involvement in Washington\u2019s so-called \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran.\n\nEven the UAE, which has called the Abqaiq strikes that temporarily knocked out more than half of Saudi oil supply a threat to the global economy, opted to attribute May attacks on an Emirati tanker to an unidentified \u201cstate actor.\u201d The US directly called out Iran for the attacks. Among the Gulf states, only Bahrain, the host of the US 5th Fleet, has joined the maritime initiative that the United States rebranded earlier this summer after Britain reportedly balked at the \u201cOperation Sentinel\u201d moniker.\n\nBut the United States has struggled to try to get an \"Arab NATO\" bloc of sorts together for the past two decades. This was first envisioned by former US Central Command Chief Gen. Anthony Zinni as an invasion force in a possible war with Iran supported by American firepower. Zinni, a close ally of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, left the Trump administration as envoy to the Middle East Strategic Alliance last year.\n\nWhile former US officials stress that a Gulf military pact would not have the same features as the real world NATO, such as a mutual defense treaty, unity among the Middle Eastern countries could help deter Iran\u2019s military actions that have gotten more aggressive since the Trump administration reimposed sanctions on importers of Tehran\u2019s oil in May.\n\n\u201cIt would be very difficult in my view to get to an Article 5 that we have in the NATO alliance with the GCC,\u201d said John Miller, a retired three-star admiral who led US naval forces in the Gulf until 2015. \u201cBut there is value in trying to move toward mutual agreement because it does provide that deterring effect in the gulf vis-a-vis Iran. That\u2019s what will suppress their appetite for the sort of malevolent behavior that has become their stock and trade.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the Abqaiq attacks, officials from the Saudi Ministry of Interior visited Washington for an annual program review, a former US official familiar with the matter told Al-Monitor, though the ministry \u2014 which oversees the Saudi Aramco facility \u2014 did not request additional air defenses. On Thursday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Pentagon would deploy a Patriot missile defense battery, four Sentinel radars and 200 support troops to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut with Egypt, the largest standing army in the region, still outside of the bloc, the remaining Gulf nations would face manpower shortages for an alliance and scrutiny from a skeptical US Congress that has pushed to end American involvement in Yemen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not their capability, it\u2019s the manpower issue,\u201d said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute. \u201cWhere are you going to get troops?\u201d", "description": "The Donald Trump administration is working to push forward with a military alliance of Middle Eastern states as the international community looks to respond to a suspected Iranian attack on a Saudi oil facility.", "authors": ["Jack Detsch"], "top_image": "https://9c998969b63acdb676d1-37595348221e1b716e1a6cfee3ed7891.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/almpics/2019/09/RTX36SZ3.jpg/RTX36SZ3-870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
