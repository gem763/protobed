It was a policeman, telling her that her oldest child, Michael, and I had been involved in a serious car crash.\n\n\u2018Are they alive?\u2019 Mum asked, only to be told she needed to get to the hospital as soon as possible, perhaps to say her final goodbyes.\n\nWe were youngsters at the time. I can still remember Mum crying at my bedside before I went into surgery.\n\nThe crash, caused by a drunk, driving on the wrong side of the road, was many years ago.\n\nI\u2019m relating this story because these memories came flooding back when I read this week how Charlotte Charles, the mother of a 19-year-old boy, Harry Dunn (pictured), received a phone call to say he had been involved in a road crash\n\nYet I can vividly recall the car\u2019s headlights, the awful sound of the collision and the blood.\n\nEven writing this now brings back the awful images.\n\nHowever, I have one sweet memory from that terrible night: my big brother Michael beside me in the ambulance holding my hand and, for the first time ever, telling me he loved me.\n\nI\u2019m relating this story because these memories came flooding back when I read this week how Charlotte Charles, the mother of a 19-year-old boy, received a phone call to say he had been involved in a road crash.\n\nIs it too much to ask for Anne Sacoolas (pictured) to come back to the UK and meet her victim\u2019s mum face-to-face \u2014 mother to mother \u2014 and explain what happened?\n\nHarry was crushed on his motorcycle when it was hit by a car said to be travelling on the wrong side of the road in Northamptonshire.\n\nHis mum had no chance to say goodbye because he soon died in hospital.\n\nSubsequently, she learned that the driver was the wife of an American diplomat and was claiming diplomatic immunity against prosecution. This was despite the police telling Mrs Charles that they have CCTV footage of the car on the wrong side of the road.\n\nMost shockingly, the woman was then secretly flown back to the U.S., where President Donald Trump crassly said that she would not return to Britain.\n\nWhere do I start with such a case? The grotesque abuse of diplomatic immunity? Or Trump\u2019s \u2018insensitive, clumsy, oafish and insulting\u2019 reaction? Those were the words used by Harry\u2019s family lawyer.\n\nIn the case of the crash involving my brother and me, the reckless driver who hit us was not breathalysed and was never charged by police with any offence. It took us months to recover fully and I still have scars from the accident.\n\nOf course, my story isn\u2019t anywhere near as serious as the one involving Harry\u2019s mum, but I know the pain of being a victim of a crime that has gone unpunished.\n\nIs it too much to ask for Anne Sacoolas to come back to the UK and meet her victim\u2019s mum face-to-face \u2014 mother to mother \u2014 and explain what happened?\n\nSadness of lonely heart Ulrika\n\nRecently divorced from her third husband, the indefatigable romantic Ulrika Jonsson is still looking for love. This week she appeared (in aid of charity, too) on a celeb special of Channel 4\u2019s First Dates Hotel.\n\nShe was matched with a bloke called Paul who, in my view, was as attractive as a cake left out in the rain.\n\nUlrika, 52, claimed she was looking for a man to make her laugh, saying the last time she did so was \u2018probably about 2005\u2019.\n\nHow sad that the one-time radiant TV weather girl has turned into the queen of lonely hearts and a walking warning about the dangers of spending too much time in the sun.\n\nRecently divorced from her third husband, the indefatigable romantic Ulrika Jonsson is still looking for love. This week she appeared in First Dates Hotel\n\nRod Stewart has urged men over 50 to get checked for prostate cancer, saying after three months of radiotherapy: \u2018It\u2019s a rotten disease that can give you no warning and no symptoms.\u2019\n\nThis is wise advice to women, too, to pester our men to get regular checks, however much they feel the subject is awkward to discuss.\n\nWags take sides in big Roodunnit\n\nThe Wag sisterhood\u2019s outrage on behalf of Mother Superior WAG Coleen Rooney has been magnificent.\n\nOne footballer\u2019s wife, the exotically named Chantelle Heskey, referred to her friend\u2019s perceived betrayal by Rebekah Vardy by saying: \u2018To find out it\u2019s someone you\u2019re supposed to trust, it must be hard . . . Coleen is a private person.\u2019\n\nSo private that Mrs Rooney shares details of her family life with 830,000 Instagram followers and was paid \u00a32.5 million by OK! magazine for photos of her wedding.\n\nMan gets BBC job!\n\nShock, horror! Pass the smelling salts!\n\nA top job at the BBC has gone to a middle-class white man.\n\nThe new chairman of Radio 4\u2019s Any Questions to replace Jonathan Dimbleby is long-standing Westminster reporter Chris Mason \u2014 a Cambridge University graduate to boot.\n\nHow refreshing that the best person for the role has been chosen, rather than BBC bosses pandering to a pro-women, pro-diversity agenda as pursued by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.\n\nThis week, it said that programmes would not be considered for its annual Bafta awards if they don\u2019t meet a \u2018diversity standard\u2019 that demands that \u2018at least one of the lead characters, contributors, presenters or voice artists are from an under-represented group\u2019.\n\nKeira shows new mothers the way\n\nKeira Knightley wafted into the premiere of her new movie about an Iraq war whistleblower in a big, white billowing meringue dress, just weeks after giving birth to her second child.\n\nWhile so many other celebrities try to defy nature by starving themselves into their pre-baby figure faster than most dud films these days go straight to video, Keira has the glorious look of a proud new mum.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the 34-year-old\u2019s enduring charm.\n\nKeira Knightley wafted into the premiere of her new movie about an Iraq war whistleblower in a big, white billowing meringue dress\n\nHow typical of oh-so sanctimonious actor Benedict Cumberbatch to join Extinction Rebellion activists in sabotaging people\u2019s daily lives in London. He should ponder the words of Sherlock Holmes, the character he plays on TV. \u2018The chief proof of man\u2019s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness.\u2019\n\nShameless and unshameable Ant McPartlin, who hooked up with his personal assistant after splitting from his wife of 11 years, is preparing to return to our screens amid the creepy crawlies in the Aussie jungle with his chum Dec on ITV\u2019s I\u2019m A Celebrity. How apt, as every time I see his self-satisfied little face I think of a snake.\n\nThe two so-called British Jihadi Beatles \u2014 Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh \u2014 are to be sent to America for trial where they face a death sentence.\n\nThey are accused of being part of a four-man \u2018kill squad\u2019 that beheaded 20 people, including British aid workers and American journalists.\n\nAs these terror suspects grew up in the UK, they should be in the dock at the Old Bailey and if convicted, jailed for life.\n\nIt would be the best message in the do-or-die battle to stop other young men and women being enticed to become ISIS killers.\n\nMulti-star Michelin chef Heston Blumenthal claims the reason women don\u2019t make it to the top table in the restaurant business is that their biological clocks kick in.\n\nWomen are \u2018not as good at lifting pots and pans\u2019 after childbirth. Let me be first in the queue to braise Blumenthal overnight in a slow cooker.", "description": "AMANDA PLATELL: My mum got the phone call every parent dreads.
