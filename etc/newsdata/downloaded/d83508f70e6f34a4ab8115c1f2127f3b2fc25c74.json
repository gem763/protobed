Tom McClintock, of California, took issue with House Democrats, who took a big step in their impeachment push as they set the ground rules for a formal committee inquiry.\n\nThe committee voted 24-17 to define the rules for future committee impeachment hearings. While the committee is not writing articles of impeachment and nothing is going to the floor of the House right now, the session still holds political consequences for both sides of the aisle.\n\nIMPEACHMENT FEVER RISES AS DEMS FACE SUMMER-RECESS PRESSURE TO GO AFTER TRUMP\n\n\"The resolution before us represents the necessary next step in our investigation of corruption, obstruction, and abuse of power,\u201d Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, of New York, said in his opening statement.\n\nTo clear confusion around the advancement of impeachment, Nadler said the panel is \u201cengaged in an investigation as to whether to launch an impeachment investigation into President Trump.\"\n\nMcClintock was apparently fed up with Democrats seemingly dancing around the issue of whether to actually pursue impeachment, arguing that they want the \"illusion of impeachment without the reality.\"\n\nTRUMP PROBES ROCKET TO FRONT OF DEM AGENDA, AS PRESIDENT DISMISSES NEW ETHICS COMPLAINT\n\n\u201cIf the majority wants to exercise the House\u2019s power of impeachment, all you got to do is ask the House to do so,\" McClintock said. \"All you have to do is ask the House that it direct and authorize this committee to conduct an impeachment inquiry. That\u2019s all you have to do.\"\n\n\u201cResolve that the House authorizes the Judiciary Committee to conduct an inquiry into the impeachment of the president. It\u2019s that simple. I dare you to do it. In fact, I double dog dare you to do it. Have the House vote on those 18 words and then go at it. Why won't you do that?\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has long expressed her skepticism about impeachment, urging Democrats to zero in on issues such as climate change, health care and the economy instead. Last month she was heckled by unhappy protesters at a dinner in San Francisco.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut asked by Fox News on Monday if she supported Nadler, Pelosi said: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you should characterize it for what it is, it\u2019s a continuation of what we have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know we all work together on these things.\u201d\n\nResponding on \"Outnumbered,\" Democrat Capri Cafaro \u2013 a former Ohio state senator \u2013 said she's worried that impeachment will not resonate with voters in the middle.\n\n\"I think this is bad politics for Democrats,\" she said, arguing that many Americans have a \"general fatigue\" with impeachment.\n\nFox News\u2019 Adam Shaw contributed to this report.", "description": "A House Republican issued a \"double dog dare\" to Democrats on the\u00a0Judiciary Committee Thursday, challenging them to call a vote on the impeachment of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/mcclintock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
