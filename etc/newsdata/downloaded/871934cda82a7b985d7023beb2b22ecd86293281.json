GLOBAL MARKETS-Oil steps back on Saudi supply reassurance, focus shifts to Fed\n\n* Oil steps back as Saudi says has restored supply\n\n* Geopolitical tensions still support oil\n\n* Investors expect Fed to cut rates 0.25% point on Wed\n\n* U.S. repo squeeze makes Fed QE more likely - Gundlach\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices cooled on Wednesday as\n\nSaudi Arabia said full oil production would be restored by\n\nmonth's end while caution ahead of an expected U.S. interest\n\nrate cut kept wider financial markets in tight ranges.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nwas up 0.13 % while Japan's Nikkei was\n\nflat.\n\nWall Street shares ticked up a tad on Tuesday with the S&P\n\n500 gaining 0.26%.\n\nBrent crude futures dipped 0.1% to $64.50 a barrel,\n\nhaving conceded more than 60% of their gains made after the\n\nweekend attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.5% to\n\n$59.06 per barrel, compared to four-month peak of $68.38 marked\n\non Monday.\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin on Tuesday Salman\n\nsought to reassure markets, saying the kingdom would restore its\n\nlost oil production by month-end having recovered supplies to\n\ncustomers to the levels they were prior to weekend attacks.\n\n\"I would think a spike in oil prices will likely prove to be\n\nshort-term given that the global economy isn't doing too well,\"\n\nsaid Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One.\n\nStill, heightened geopolitical tensions underpinned oil as\n\nwell as some safe-haven assets such as U.S. bonds.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday the United States\n\nbelieves the attacks originated in southwestern Iran, an\n\nassessment that could further increase the rivalry between\n\nTehran and Riyadh.\n\nAdding to uncertainties in the Middle East were exit polls\n\nfrom Israel's election, which showed the race too close to call\n\nsuggesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fight for\n\npolitical survival could drag on. Gold was mostly flat at $1,502.10, while the 10-year\n\nU.S. Treasuries yield fell to 1.810% , compared with\n\nFriday's high of 1 1/2-month high of 1.908% ahead of the Fed's\n\npolicy announcement on Wednesday.\n\nWhile a 25-basis point rate cut is seen as near-certain,\n\ninvestors look to the statement and economic projections from\n\nFed policy makers, given signs of deep disagreements among them.\n\n\"Markets are currently almost pricing in three more rate\n\nhikes by the end of next year, including one by the end of this\n\nyear, but the chances are that the Fed's stance will be more\n\nhawkish than markets and we could see rise in bond yields in the\n\nnear term,\" said Masahiko Loo, portfolio manager at Alliance\n\nBernstein.\n\nThe ongoing U.S.-China trade war has raised policymakers'\n\nconcerns about slowing factory output although resilient\n\ndomestic consumption has given hawks some reasons to worry about\n\ncutting rates too hastily.\n\nPossibly further complicating their discussion, short-term\n\nU.S. interest rates shot up this week, with overnight repo rates\n\nrising to 7%, due largely to seasonal factors such as huge\n\npayments for taxes and bond supply.\n\nThat prompted the New York Fed to conduct its first repo\n\noperation in more than a decade to inject funds to stressed\n\nmoney markets. The New York Federal Reserve said late Tuesday it will\n\nconduct a repurchase agreement operation early Wednesday \"in\n\norder to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target\n\nrange of\" 2.00% to 2.25%. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital,\n\nsaid on Tuesday that the repo market squeeze makes it more\n\nlikely that the Federal Reserve will resume expansion of its\n\nbalance sheet \"pretty soon.\" Also in focus is the Bank of Japan's policy meeting due\n\nThursday. While the latest Reuters poll suggests the BOJ will\n\nkeep its policy on hold, 28 of 41 economists expect it will ease\n\nits policy this year and 13 believe it may surprise by taking\n\naction at the Thursday meeting. In the currency market, the euro stood flat at $1.1066\n\nafter 0.6% gain the previous day on better-than-expected\n\nreadings in Germany's ZEW survey on investor confidence.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2489 GBP=D4 , down 0.05% so far on\n\nthe day, having hit two-month high of $1.2528 as investors\n\nreversed their bets against the currency on fear of a no-deal\n\nBrexit at the end of next month.\n\nThe yen eased slightly to 108.26 yen , near 1\n\n1/2-month low of 108.37 touched on Tuesday.\n\n(Editing by Sam Holmes)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Oil steps back on Saudi supply reassurance, focus shifts to Fed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6U08A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
