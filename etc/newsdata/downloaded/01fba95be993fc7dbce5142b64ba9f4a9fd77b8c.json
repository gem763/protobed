The EU is fighting back | Julian King Read more\n\nBut King said there had remained \u201ctoo much disinformation\u201d around the European elections in May, and that the debate about regulation of social media was developing at pace on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nHe pointed to a study from George Washington university that found that in the run-up to and during the European elections, the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party in Germany, which took 11% of the vote overall, received 86% of total shares and 75% of all comments on party political content in Germany posted on Facebook. That was four times the comments and six times the shares of all the other parties combined.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of likes and shares came from a cluster of 80,000 accounts which were busily retweeting this stuff and they have many of the features of fake accounts,\u201d King said. \u201cIn particular the most active \u2013 around 20,000 accounts \u2013 had random two letter first and last names. For example MX, CH, EW, which as it happens would not be legal names if you tried to register on a birth certificate in Germany.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf a platform like Facebook with their resources and their knowledge can\u2019t figure out that thousands of coordinated accounts with random two-letter names are suspicious and are engaging in this kind of activity in the context of the election, when we have put all that focus on it, then we still have some way to go.\u201d\n\nKing was speaking as the commission published reports compiled by Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Mozilla, all signatories to a voluntary EU code of practice. The commission said in an accompanying summary that while there had been some progress there were \u201cserious further steps\u201d to be made.\n\nThe efforts to advise consumers on what they were reading and who was behind it were said to be \u201cpatchy\u201d although the commission praised Facebook\u2019s clear policy to label ads with \u201cpaid for by\u201d disclaimers.\n\nIndependent researchers tasked with finding disinformation on sites were not, however, being given the access they needed to allow them to do their jobs. The commission said it was also concerned that various companies were continuing to sell \u201cfake account activity\u201d for a few hundred euros.\n\n\u201cThere is a kind of stock and flow problem,\u201d King said of Facebook, which admits to hosting some 120m fake accounts. \u201cThey are definitely affecting the flow, they are stopping some of this stuff being set up. But there is still quite a lot of this stuff there. It can have a disproportionate impact because a relatively small number of fake accounts can generate an enormous amount of activity.\u201d\n\nKing said the platforms would need to open themselves to greater scrutiny to outside organisations if the EU was to stand by the voluntary code of conduct. A further report in January will reveal EU member states\u2019 reactions to the platforms\u2019 efforts over the past 12 months.\n\nKing said there were \u201cnegative examples\u201d where \u201cwhat platforms say and lived experience does not entirely align\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf we are really going to make progress on this then we are going to have to have a step-change in the amount of outside scrutiny that the platforms are going to tolerate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDo you need, because of the questions it raises about the integrity of government, to think about some form of regulation? We are not there yet but we have to have that debate.\n\nMore than 250 employees have signed a letter to Zuckerberg decrying Facebook\u2019s decision to allow politicians to post ads on the platform that include false claims, it was reported on Monday.\n\nThe letter, posted on an internal communication message board for the company, said: \u201cMisinformation affects us all. Our current policies on factchecking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for.\u201d", "description": "Commissioner says \u2018still some way to go\u2019 in battle against disinformation on social media", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f75be590094a0490cb8d2b1117c134f975b2967/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=35159e02c61220fc0a46cbd61cf783c7", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
