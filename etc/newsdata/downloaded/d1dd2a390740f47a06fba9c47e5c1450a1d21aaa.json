This was the result they had hoped for. After so much talk of whether they would be able to effectively compete at this year\u2019s World Cup, following an indifferent 12 months on the pitch, Joe Schmidt\u2019s men stepped up to the mark. Blowing away their Scottish rivals in the whipping rain here at Yokohama\u2019s Nissan Stadium, the Irish delivered in style.\n\nThe 27-3 victory confirmed what Ireland are capable of, even with the absence of numerous key players in the shape of Rob Kearney and Keith Earls. It was a performance built on so many of their trademark qualities: physical dominance at the set-piece, a firm, resolute defence, an attritional forward line, accurate kicking and clinical ruthlessness.\n\nScotland, as a result, were unable to produce the sort of attacking rugby that, in the past, has caused this Irish team trouble. The threat of Stuart Hogg, Sean Maitland and Finn Russell were all nullified as they struggled to breakdown the resilient green wall that bore down on them from start to finish. The Scots looked lifeless, lacking any real urgency or aggression.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

That break saw Ireland camped out on the edge of the Scottish try line, before Ryan wiggled through to score. The second, coming seven minutes later, saw Best surge over this time after a rolling Irish maul pushed back Scotland\u2019s fragile defence down in the left-hand corner. As for the third, it was bread-and-butter stuff from Ireland. Off an Irish scrum, the ball was recycled through two phases, culminating in Furlong\u2019s barrelling effort from two yards out.\n\nIn return, the Scots were only able to offer a solitary penalty kick from Greig Laidlaw. A late surge in the first half promised to yield some points but an injury to Hamish Watson, with the forward being carried off on the stretcher van, took the sting out of Scotland\u2019s momentum.\n\nThe second half restarted amid deteriorating weather conditions. Ireland seized the initiative in the pouring rain, looking to target their opponents with repeated high ball. It reaped rich rewards in the form of a deserved Conway try. Off a punishing kick from Murray, the Dark Blues fumbled possession in their 22, with Jordan Larmour pouncing on the loose ball. He set up Conway to his right who, putting his quick feet to good use, danced past two Scottish players before finding the white line down on the right.\n\nScotland enjoyed a brief resurgence around the 50th minute, as they slowly built their way up into Ireland\u2019s final quarter, but a dropped ball from John Barclay took the wind out of their sails. It was a moment which summed up Scotland\u2019s evening. Even with substitute Tadhg Beirne\u2019s late yellow card, the Scots proved unable to add to Laidlaw\u2019s first-half kick.\n\nMaking the most of the poor weather conditions, it was an Irish performance that fizzed with intelligent, free-flowing rugby. Injuries to Peter O'Mahony and Bundee Aki will be of concern, both men forced off after Head Injury Assessments (HIAs), while Josh Van Der Flier was forced out late on. But on the back of this encouraging performance, Schmidt\u2019s men stand in fine stead looking forward to the tougher challenges that will inevitably come their way.", "description": "This was the performance Ireland\u00a0needed.
