And I\u2019m not going to get into the details of that. \u2026 But regardless of who wrote it and who approved it, it was wrong. It was incorrect. It should never have been sent out. We\u2019ve learned a lesson about it,\u201d he said.\n\nTaubman had apologized Tuesday for using language that was \u201cunprofessional and inappropriate\u201d in the Astros clubhouse following Saturday night\u2019s pennant-clinching victory over the New York Yankees.\n\nSI reported Taubman repeatedly yelled toward a group of female reporters about closer Roberto Osuna, who was suspended for 75 games last year for violating MLB\u2019s domestic violence policy and then was traded from Toronto to the Astros.\n\nTaubman shouted \u201cThank God we got Osuna!\u201d according to SI, which said he made similar remarks several times, punctuating them with a profanity. Taubman\u2019s behavior was corroborated by reporters for The Houston Chronicle and Yahoo.\n\nAfter an investigation by Major League Baseball and the Astros, Luhnow met with Taubman on Thursday and fired him before the team traveled to Washington in what Luhnow termed \u201ca pretty tough conversation.\u201d\n\nTaubman did not respond to a text from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nHouston\u2019s initial statement Monday claimed SI tried to \u201cfabricate a story where one does not exist\u201d and maintained Taubman\u2019s comments weren\u2019t directed at reporters. Luhnow said he was among the Astros officials who saw the statement before it was issued.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about that first statement that was correct or that\u2019s defensible,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cThe original impression that we had, without doing an investigation \u2014 and that\u2019s our fault for not doing the investigation \u2014 was that it was two colleagues talking who were overheard and the comments were not directed at anybody in particular, not meant to be mean-spirited in any way or offensive in any way, just supportive of the player who had had a bad night.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut as we continued to investigate, it was clear that they were intended to be heard. And they were completely inappropriate,\u201d he said.\n\nLuhnow said the Astros decided Wednesday \u201cthat we were going to take action unilaterally ahead of Major League Baseball making any recommendations.\u201d He said Taubman\u2019s behavior did not indicate a wider problem in the Astros\u2019 front office.\n\n\u201cThis is not something that\u2019s endemic. This is not a cultural issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of really good people in our front office, in our coaching staff, and our team.\u201d\n\nHouston apologized to the SI reporter, the magazine and people who saw the incident, and to those who were offended.\n\n\u201cThe Astros are very committed to using our voice to create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence,\u201d the team said in a statement.\n\nAstros manager AJ Hinch has been critical of Taubman\u2019s behavior since the SI report came out.\n\n\u201cI continue to be disappointed and just sorry it happened,\u201d Hinch said.\n\nA 2007 graduate of Cornell with a degree in applied economics, Taubman worked for Ernst & Young and then as an analyst in the equity derivatives group of Barclays Investment Bank before he was hired by the Astros as an analyst in June 2013.\n\nHe was promoted to manager of baseball operations before the 2014 season, director of baseball operations in October 2015, senior director of baseball operations in August 2017 and assistant general manager in September 2018, tasked with major league administrative functions and oversight of analytics and pro player scouting. The Astros announced a contract extension on Sept. 30 and a wider role as assistant general manager, player evaluation.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a valuable employee. We hired him over five years ago, he\u2019s moved up quickly in the organization,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cHe\u2019s smart. He\u2019s hard working. And these comments that he made were out of character. He hasn\u2019t had this type of incident before. This is not a repeating pattern of anything, which is why it was so easy for us to believe that it was more innocent than it turned out to be.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Houston Astros fired assistant general manager Brandon Taubman on Thursday for directing inappropriate comments at", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Patrick-Semansky-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
