Campus free speech advocate FIRE says the investigation should be dropped on First Amendment grounds.\n\nCal Poly has confirmed that it is investigating a photo posted to Instagram, which shows students at an apparent themed party based on the film \u201cCowboys and Aliens,\u201d with the \u201caliens\u201d component altered in order to make reference to illegal aliens, according to a report by Mustang News.\n\n\u201cWe were disappointed to learn of a photo that has begun to circulate on social media that appears to demean undocumented students,\u201d wrote Cal Poly president Jeffrey Armstrong to students, according to an email obtained by Campus Reform.\n\n\u201cWe know that this photo has a negative impact on members of our community,\u201d he added, \u201cparticularly members of our undocumented student, faculty and staff community, their allies and others who work to promote an environment of inclusion at Cal Poly. For those who are hurt by this photo, know that we empathize and we stand with you.\u201d\n\nThe university president added that the school will be looking further into the Instagram posting.\n\n\u201cThis reported incident has added to the urgency of addressing our campus climate and creating an environment where every individual feels valued, safe and important for who they are and the additive talent they bring to Cal Poly,\u201d said Armstrong.\n\nThe school\u2019s student government also chimed in by issuing a statement on the matter, claiming that \u201cno human is \u2018illegal.'\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned with the social media post that is circulating the campus targeting our undocumented community,\u201d said Cal Poly\u2019s student government, adding that it \u201cstands in solidarity\u201d with illegal aliens.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened that our underrepresented community continuously experiences these instances of overt prejudice,\u201d the statement added. \u201cNo human is \u2018illegal.\u2019 This language is dehumanizing and inaccurate.\u201d\n\nWill Creeley, the senior vice president of Legal and Public Advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), told Campus Reform that Cal Poly should end its investigation, as the university must uphold its students\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cCalifornia Polytechnic State University is a public university bound by the First Amendment,\u201d said Creely. \u201cThe Instagram post is protected by the First Amendment. FIRE is learning more about the situation, but absent more, Cal Poly should end its investigation into protected expression.\u201d\n\nCal Poly spokesperson Matt Lazier told Breitbart News that \u201cthe university continues to meet with students involved in the photo and the gathering where it was taken, in order to learn the full facts surrounding the image and determine whether it involved any violations of university policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs of now, the university has determined that the gathering itself \u2014 which took place at a private residence off campus \u2014 did not involve any university-sanctioned organizations and did not violate any university policies,\u201d added Lazier. \u201cPrivacy laws preclude the university from discussing or acknowledging any specific individual student conduct investigations or sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson also responded to Breitbart News\u2019 inquiry regarding an example of a similar party, suggesting that the university would, in fact, investigate a report of misconduct over a themed party involving students dressed as FBI agents and Italian mafia members with fedoras.\n\n\u201cSpeaking generally, we investigate all reports of possible student misconduct,\u201d said Lazier. \u201cWhere misconduct has occurred, the university applies appropriate sanctions aimed at educating students; holding them accountable; and helping them to stay safe and healthy and to avoid future policy violations.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) is investigating a photo showcasing an apparent \"cowboys and (illegal) aliens\" costume party held by students.
