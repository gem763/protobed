The A\u2019s are listed as -130 home favorites with LHP Sean Manaea taking the bump against Rays\u2019 RHP Charlie Morton.\n\nWe\u2019ll highlight the top picks and best bargains to assemble a cash-inducing lineup. On top of that, the \u201cadditional notes\u201d section will feature several tournament selections while adding context to the rest of this slate.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day.

The Tampa outfielder has been terrific against left-handed pitching this season, holding an impressive 160 wRC+ and .407 wOBA mark in that regard. Putting things into context, Pham ranks near the top ten in each of those categories this season along the same lines as other notorious lefty-mashers like Mike Trout, Anthony Rendon, and Eugenio Suarez.\n\nMatt Olson - 1B - Oakland\n\nTampa RHP Charlie Morton had a career season with a 3.05 ERA followed by a rewarding 11.10 K/9 rate as well. If we zoom in on his numbers, we\u2019ll notice that he has been more generous to left-handed bats this season, holding a .293 wOBA split compared to a .247 wOBA against right-handed hitters. Sure, a .293 wOBA mark isn\u2019t generous at all, but it represents a fraction of vulnerability, which is something we need to consider on this single game slate. Olson is one of the few legitimate left-handed bats for Oakland, and this is an opportunity for him to deliver in a huge spot.\n\nNOTABLE BARGAINS\n\nAvisail Garcia - OF - Tampa Bay\n\nGarcia is basically the cheap version of his teammate, Pham, who was listed above. \u201cAvi\u201d holds respectable career numbers against left-handed pitching (118 wRC+, .344 wOBA), and his season-long splits hover around that mark. Garcia has a comfortable blend of contact and power while hitting .282 with 20 homers and 72 RBIs this season. Put it all together, and I believe he\u2019s an easy bargain lift through all formats.\n\nJurickson Profar - 2B - Oakland\n\nProfar is less obvious as a bargain choice, but he could make some noise in this winner-take-all contest. First off, he\u2019s a switch-hitter who won\u2019t be compromised by handedness out of the bullpen. Profar is dirt-cheap on most DFS sites as well, making him a serious candidate to round out any lineup once you\u2019ve stacked the high-priority hitters. He\u2019s another Oakland bat who could take advantage of Morton\u2019s slight susceptibility to lefties.\n\nALSO CONSIDER\n\nMarcus Semien (SS - OAK) and Matt Chapman (3B - OAK) are both expensive while stepping into a tough matchup against Morton - and that aforementioned split to righty bats. I\u2019m not forcing either into my lineup unless the opportunity presents itself. When choosing between the two, Semien is the choice as an all-around player with several paths to upside.\n\nKhris Davis (OF - OAK) and Ramon Laureano (OF - OAK) are strictly tournaments plays who could hold lower-than-expected ownership rates. Davis has struggled over the past month, and DFS enthusiasts will likely hold that against him. However, if anyone can break a slump with one swing of the bat, it\u2019s him \u2026 Laureano has less of a boom-or-bust spirit about him, as he put together a fine season while hitting .288 with 24 homers. He\u2019s an acceptable cash game filler if you need someone in his salary range, but I\u2019m mostly looking to this duo in GPPs.\n\nYandy Diaz (3B - TB) and Travis d\u2019Arnaud (C - TB) are enticing tournaments picks with bargain salaries. We\u2019ll need to double-check the lineup card with respect to Diaz, who could hold a premium spot in the order while facing LHP Manaea. If that\u2019s the case, he makes for a strong lift as well as a synergy play with Pham and Garcia \u2026 We noticed this yesterday with Yasmani Grandal, as people don\u2019t like to use catchers at FLEX positions. Like Grandal, d\u2019Arnaud is a backstop who is more than capable of contributing on offense, especially while holding the platoon advantage over Manaea. d\u2019Arnaud has 11 hits over his last 10 starts, so he\u2019s swinging a confident bat as well.", "description": "Spencer Limbach uncovers the best MLB DFS Plays for the AL Wild Card game between Oakland and Tampa Bay.
