(Image: Emma McIntyre, Getty Images)\n\nAmazon really is dead set on keeping everyone more or less in the dark about its upcoming Lord of the Rings prequel series that\u2019s set before the events of The Fellowship of the Ring. The studio\u2019s still keeping quiet about the story\u2019s details, but it\u2019s just announced another actor who\u2019s set to join the cast.\n\nVariety reports that Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\u2019s Will Poulter has joined Lord of the Rings\u2019 cast in an unnamed, but lead, role.\n\nThe secrecy is... weird, to be honest, considering that Markella Kavenagh\u2019s \u201cTyra\u201d was named when the actress was cast earlier this year. Though that was an unknown character so perhaps Poulter is playing a well-known figure in Tolkien\u2019s universe.\n\nThe name alone could telegraph rather significant details about the series that Amazon wants to keep hush-hush, but eventually, we\u2019re really going to need to learn a bit more information about the show if it wants to stay fresh and interesting in everyone\u2019s minds.\n\nVariety reminds us who is involved behind the scenes:\n\nThe \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series is being developed by the writing team of JD Payne and Patrick McKay. In addition, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d alum Bryan Cogman has signed on as a consulting producer on the project with J.A. Bayona set to direct multiple episodes. In addition to those previously mentioned, the show\u2019s full creative team will consist of: executive producers Lindsey Weber, Bruce Richmond, Gene Kelly, and Amazon\u2019s former head of genre programming Sharon Tal Yguado; writer and executive producer Gennifer Hutchison; writer and executive producer Jason Cahill; writer and executive producer Justin Doble; consulting producer Stephany Folsom; producer Ron Ames; writer and co-producer Helen Shang; and writing consultant Glenise Mullins. Bayona will also executive produce along with his partner Bel\u00e9n Atienza.\n\nPoulter is, of course, also well known to genre fans as playing Eustace in the Chronicles of Narnia film series and Gally in Maze Runner. We\u2019ll bring you more on Amazon\u2019s Lord of the Rings as we know it.", "description": "Amazon really is dead set on keeping everyone more or less in the dark about its upcoming Lord of the Rings prequel series that\u2019s set before the events of The Fellowship of the Ring.
