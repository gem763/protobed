I'm tired at times but there's nothing better in the world than seeing a smile on your kid's face or hearing him say 'I love you' or when you walk in from a trip, having their arms just flung around your body for a hug.\n\n\"This is probably one of the greatest things I've ever had the chance to do, to welcome three healthy boys into this world and have the best wife to raise the three of them.\"\n\nMichael Phelps waves during the medal ceremony of the Men's 100m Butterfly Final at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.\n\nPhelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, won 23 golds, three silvers and two bronze during an illustrious career, though he thinks he \"never competed in a clean field once\" in his life.\n\n\"That has to change,\" added Phelps, as he reflected on the issue of doping in sport. \"If you test positive once you should never be allowed to compete again.\"\n\nHis success propelled him to fame and fortune, becoming one of the most recognized sports stars in the world. His eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games remains one of modern sport's greatest achievements.\n\nBut Phelps also had his struggles.\n\nThat retirement did not last however, and he returned to action in Rio four years later, winning four golds and a silver before retiring for good.\n\nSince then he has spent time campaigning on issues surrounding mental health and the environment and while he accepts being in the public eye can be difficult, he says it has given him a platform to pursue causes that are close to his heart.\n\nMichael Phelps won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n\"It's difficult at times,\" Phelps said when asked about dealing with fame. \"When I'm in public with my family and I just want to have a dinner it's challenging at times.\n\n\"But I also understand that this is who I am and what I've been able to do and had the opportunity to do is something I've always dreamed of and something I wanted to do, something nobody has ever seen before. So to be doing that, I think it just comes along with the territory.\n\n\"I've kind of got used to it because now I have the opportunity to use the platform that I have in order to step up and talk about things that are important and things we can all do to make a little bit of change in today's society.\"", "description": "Swimming legend Michael Phelps is more likely to jump in a ball pool than a swimming pool these days.", "authors": ["James Masters", "Don Riddell"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180816125545-michael-phelps-tease-1-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
