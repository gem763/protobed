Farming communities are bitterly divided over the issue \u2013 but it also has global consequences\n\nBut while land clearing might benefit individual farmers in the short term, the loss of native vegetation comes with enormous costs for the rest of us.\n\nThat alone is enough for farmers to risk up to $1m in fines for illegally clearing, according to one former NSW Office of Environment and Heritage compliance officer, who asked not to be named.\n\nClearing vegetation has the potential to add millions to a property\u2019s value, as well as yielding high returns in a good year.\n\nThink of land clearing like a rezoning in the city. Land cleared for cropping west of Moree sells for $2,500 a hectare whereas grazing land will sell for between $700 and $1000 a hectare. East of Moree most of the prime land has already been converted to crops and sells for $6,800 a hectare, three times the value of grazing land.\n\n\u201cThere is something seriously not right about the extent of land clearing in my little part of the world,\u201d he says.\n\nPockets of remaining vegetation have been ripped from the grey soil to expand cultivation and square up paddocks \u2013 and the first Fitzgerald knows of it is when the bulldozers arrive.\n\nFitzgerald says the microclimate of the nearby Welbon plains has moved a kilometre further on to his property since losing a tree line on Kurstjens\u2019 property that once sheltered his land.\n\nThe old easement to Fitzgerald\u2019s cottage across the sprawling Beefwood property has been planted over with crops. His letterbox has mysteriously disappeared on several occasions, making it hard for visitors to spot the entrance to his farm. But it is the extent of land clearing by his neighbour, Beefwood\u2019s owner, Gerardus Kurstjens, that has upset him the most.\n\nRoger Fitzgerald\u2019s family has been farming near Moree since 1925. But these days he feels under siege on his own farm. His 1,700-hectare property, 50km north of the town, is now surrounded by the operations of the sprawling agribusiness Beefwood Farms, which has been steadily buying up land in New South Wales to expand its operations.\n\nSo why does this matter? According to scientists, land clearing can result in erosion and poorer soil quality for farming, drive species loss, and cause a significant increase in Australia's carbon emissions.\n\nSome time in August 2017, the vegetation was allegedly cleared without proper authorisation. Here's what the property looked like in November 2018 .\n\nSo what does land clearing look like? Here, you can see a satellite photo of a property in north-western NSW in February 2015 . The dark blobs are trees.\n\nThis map shows the total clearing of vegetation for agricultural purposes, with clearing hotspots in central and north-western NSW. Bogan Shire had the highest amount of clearing in 2017-18, followed by Cobar Shire .\n\nThe NSW government releases satellite-derived data for the change in woody vegetation by local government area.\n\nHere, you can see the cumulative loss of tree cover over time from 2001 to 2017. This is based on satellite imagery data, and includes loss of tree canopy over a certain density. It's not all deliberate clearing \u2013 it also includes loss of tree cover from fires, and doesn't include clearing of native grasslands. State forests and national parks have been excluded.\n\nAustralia is among the 11 worst countries when it comes to deforestation, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Queensland has the highest clearing rate but NSW is rapidly becoming a hotspot.\n\n\u201cLand clearance and degradation is one of the greatest crises facing Australia and the world,\u201d says Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist with Berlin-based Climate Analytics. \u201cIt undermines the basis for food production, is causing species loss and ecological decline, destroys climate resilience, degrades water resources and reverses carbon storage on the land.\u201d\n\nPollution from land clearing is projected by the federal government to remain at about 46m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year to 2030, roughly equivalent to emissions from three large coal-fired power plants. The rate at which we are clearing land in Australia is almost immediately wiping out gains being made under tax-payer funded schemes to address climate change.\n\nAustralia is among the 11 worst countries when it comes to deforestation, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nQueensland, with its vast swathes of untouched land on Cape York, has the highest clearing rate, but NSW is rapidly becoming a hotspot \u2013 and there is less to lose, with only 9% of the state\u2019s vegetation in its original state.\n\nWhat is becoming clear is that successive NSW governments have failed to explain the science behind preserving native vegetation \u2013 both in relation to climate change and protecting the landscape and endangered species \u2013 to farmers and the public.\n\nInstead, land clearing laws in the state have been successively weakened, first by Labor and then more comprehensively by the Coalition, with the introduction of amendments to the Local Land Services Act in August 2017.\n\n\u201cNSW\u2019s native vegetation laws were [once] based on the principle that broad-scale land clearing would not be permitted and clearing could only proceed if it could be shown to maintain or improve environmental outcomes,\u201d says Rachel Walmsley, a solicitor at the NSW Environmental Defenders Office.\n\n\u201cThe new act brought in a new approach with the twin stated objectives of arresting the current decline in the state\u2019s biodiversity while also facilitating sustainable agricultural development.\u201d\n\nBut while farmers are mostly happy with the new rules, environmentalists say they have ushered in an environmental disaster because they allow farmers to self-assess whether clearing is permissible. The old act also protected paddock trees; the amended act has made it much easier to get rid of them.\n\nCritics say farmers have been given the green light to clear.\n\n\u201cI have sat in meetings where arguments have been put that driving a tractor around a tree is a significant cost in diesel for farmers,\u201d Walmsley says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no valuation of the ecosystem services these trees provide: clean water, clean air, healthy soils and hosting pollinators. There\u2019s no dollar value put on vegetation.\u201d\n\nDust is kicked up in a ploughed field outside Walgett, NSW. Photograph: Mike Bowers for Guardian Australia\n\nA visit to the north-west of NSW is an eye-opener. From the black soil plains of Tamworth west to Bourke and Cobar and north to the border with Queensland there has been an epidemic of clearing, as farmers indulge in a kind of arms race to convert remnant bushland into acreage suitable for cropping: wheat, soyabeans, chickpeas and cotton.\n\nBut increasingly the question must be asked: is this viable country for large-scale crop farming?\n\nUsually in winter this region would be green with winter crops. This year, as far as the eye can see, there is barren dirt \u2013 ploughed fields denuded of every tree and bush \u2013 as farmers wait in vain for rain that would enable planting.\n\nMany farmers haven\u2019t had significant income since 2012, says Brendan Moylan, a Moree lawyer and spokesman for the North West NSW Farmers Alliance, a group that has been campaigning on behalf of farming families in the region to get the government to back off prosecuting farmers for historical land clearing offences under the old act.\n\nAlready there have been dust storms this year and there will be more, on a scale not seen before. The Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s latest rainfall outlook says: \u201cRainfall is highly likely to be below average across most of the country for the remainder of 2019 and early 2020.\u201d\n\nFive decades ago this was mainly grazing country, offering scrubby paddocks that could support sheep and cattle. But the building of the Keepit dam, greater use of surface and ground water and more efficient mechanised farming have led to many farmers converting to crops \u2013 literally to the back of Bourke.\n\nNowhere is the debate about land clearing more heated than in north-west NSW.\n\nThe most extreme example of the tensions it ignites was the death of Glen Turner, an Office of Environment and Heritage compliance officer, who was shot dead at Croppa Creek in 2014 by a 79-year old landowner, Ian Turnbull. Turnbull was convicted of murder and died in jail.\n\nPeople in the Moree farming community describe Turnbull as \u201ca psycho\u201d who did their cause no favours, but in the next breath express sympathy for his frustration at not being able to manage his farm because of the laws to protect native vegetation.\n\nOn the other side of the debate is Turnbull\u2019s next-door neighbour, Alaine Anderson, who has been on her farm at Croppa Creek for 40 years. She has taken up restorative farming and is the local koala rescuer. She is horrified at what is happening across the north-west under the new laws.\n\nAlaine Anderson runs a farm and koala rescue outside Moree NSW. One of her injured animals is nearly ready for release. Photograph: Mike Bowers for Guardian Australia\n\nWhen we visit she has three injured koalas under her care. Increasingly, koalas are being hit by cars as their habitat becomes fragmented or disappears entirely, rounding them into smaller and smaller areas. Sometimes they are injured during land clearing operations because they hide under the piles of trees that are then set alight.\n\n\u201cOriginally we had sheep in our neighbourhood and much smaller holdings,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cThen we went to broad-acre [large-scale crop farming] \u2026 Then in the last decade, industrialised farming has just exploded.\n\n\u201cWith that we have seen a ruthlessness with the landscape that we hadn\u2019t seen before. Our ecology has just collapsed and with it has come a loss of a sense of community.\u201d\n\nAnderson says her friends attended a meeting on the native vegetation laws where one farmer stood up and said: \u201cIt\u2019s our land, we can do what we want\u201d \u2013 to loud applause.\n\nGetting farmers in the region to go on the record is difficult. Both sides fear reprisals.\n\nA phone call to a Walgett farmer, Cameron Rowntree, who has been on the Sydney radio station 2GB talking about the problems with the native vegetation laws, draws a blank.\n\n\u201cWe have been slaughtered by the press,\u201d he says. \u201cWe agree to interviews and we get just a couple of paragraphs. The print media is the worst.\u201d He declines to say more.\n\nEmus run across a bare field outside Moree NSW. Photograph: Mike Bowers for Guardian Australia\n\nSeveral other farmers tell Guardian Australia they won\u2019t talk to us because they fear being targeted by environment department compliance staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perceived infringement on property rights,\u201d explains Moylan, who represents a number of Moree farmers now under investigation for illegal land clearing. \u201c[The law] imposes a condition to improve or maintain native vegetation on their land. That imposes an active obligation on them without consideration of compensation.\n\n\u201cThe farming community also see that [these rules are] imposed on them for the greater good of the community, so they\u2019re wearing a disproportionate burden.\u201d\n\nOne farmer, Robert Houston, who is from near Mungindi on the Queensland-NSW border, is facing prosecution for illegally clearing 40 threatened and endangered species of vegetation on his land, including trees that were estimated to be more than 200 years old.\n\nHe has begun action in the high court arguing that expecting farmers to conserve vegetation to meet the government\u2019s climate commitments under the Kyoto protocol, without compensation, is tantamount to resumption of property by the state. The case has been remitted to the federal court for hearing.\n\nThe scientists working in the area are also fearful.\n\nOne talks about how her kids have to live in the community, how she needs to keep working for the state government, and how she has received death threats. So, sorry, she can\u2019t go on the record.\n\nEcologist Phil Spark in bush outside Moree, NSW. Photograph: Mike Bowers for Guardian Australia\n\nPhil Spark is one who is prepared to speak out. He\u2019s an independent ecologist who has worked in the region for 20 years and has been coming here since he was a child.\n\n\u201cAt that time it had native vegetation over 90% of it \u2013 now it\u2019s an average of 10% of native vegetation,\u201d he says. \u201cBack in the day when it was grazing, farmers did appreciate the value of conservation, but now it\u2019s going down the track of treating the land like a factory.\u201d\n\nSpark blames the government for the anger in the current debate and the wilful blindness to science.\n\n\u201cThey have never gone out \u2026 and explained to farmers why we need to have a landscape conservation approach,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have always sided with the farmers, and supported their argument that it\u2019s against farmers\u2019 rights to protect native vegetation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pretty despairing. There is so much science to tell us what we need to be doing and they totally ignore it.\u201d\n\nThe facts are unequivocal. NSW is losing vegetation at an alarming rate.\n\nThe former Office of Environment and Heritage (now reduced to the environment energy and science division in the Department of Planning) uses satellite imagery to determine the changes in woody vegetation \u2013 that\u2019s trees and forests \u2013 owing to forestry, agriculture and fires.\n\nThe loss of woody vegetation to agricultural clearing had hovered around 8,000 to 9,000 hectares a year until 2014-15, but spiked as farmers anticipated a law change based on the Coalition\u2019s election promises. By 2017-18 it had more than tripled to 27,100 hectares \u2013 that\u2019s an area about 100 times the size of Sydney\u2019s central business district each year.\n\nData collected by the Local Land Services offices, which administer the new laws, shows that land notified or certified to authorities as land to be partially or fully cleared under the new codes has now reached 368,000 hectares. That\u2019s an area one and a half times the size of the Australian Capital Territory. There are some set-asides \u2013 land put aside for conservation as part of clearing agreements \u2013 but these are a fraction of the losses.\n\nThe majority of the clearing is being done under the code that permits \u201clow or moderate\u201d clearing to control invasive native vegetation.\n\nBut much of this clearing, say ecologists, is not low or moderate impact because it\u2019s being done with bulldozers and disturbs the soil. Farmers also get to self-assess which code the land clearing falls under \u2013 and there appears to have been little checking about whether they are using the codes properly.\n\nIn June the NSW auditor general delivered a scathing assessment of NSW\u2019s new land clearing laws, saying they were \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cnot effectively regulated\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence-based assurance that clearing of native vegetation is being carried out in accordance with approvals,\u201d the report notes.\n\nThe auditor general was just as critical about enforcement. The report found that unexplained land clearing can take more than two years to identify and analyse, making it difficult to minimise environmental harm or gather evidence to prosecute. Despite about 1,000 instances of unexplained clearing, more than 500 reports to the environmental hotline each year and about 300 investigations in progress at any one time, there are few prosecutions, remediation orders or penalty notices for unlawful clearing.\n\nFailed crops due to lack of rain near Moree NSW. Photograph: Mike Bowers for Guardian Australia\n\nThe report elicited promises from the Department of Primary Industries to devote more resources to monitoring. But the central policy criticisms have been met with silence from the NSW government.\n\nInstead, successive National party ministers responsible for these areas have had an open-door policy for farmers and their concerns, while largely ignoring the environmental science.\n\nIn the lead-up to the new legislation being finalised, the former primary industries minister Niall Blair held regular meetings with the NSW Farmer Association\u2019s native vegetation committee and with farmers from north-west NSW and the Tablelands, ministerial diaries show.\n\nBy the time the legislation emerged, it had exemptions that undermined its environmental goals, says Prof Hugh Possingham, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and a world-renowned ecologist, who resigned from the expert committee advising the minister.\n\nHe says the committee was working to the principle that the legislation should provide for \u201cno net loss\u201d in native vegetation. That would mean that, in most cases, clearing of high-value vegetation would need to be matched with areas put aside for conservation.\n\nProfessor Hugh Possingham. Photograph: AAP\n\nInstead, the government \u201cadded some exemptions for large amounts of hectares that [would] not need to be offset\u201d, Possingham says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I resigned \u2013 because one of the fundamental principles of no net loss had been undermined.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups stormed out of consultations, saying the process had \u201cpredetermined\u201d outcomes and were skewed towards \u201cradicals in the National party\u201d. \u201cIt is now clear that the government is determined to pursue development at any cost,\u201d they said.\n\nThere have also been issues with the maps that were meant to underpin the legislation. Under the Local Land Services Act, a series of codes set out when clearing is permitted without seeking formal approval. Land that is mapped by the department as \u201csensitive\u201d must be approved for clearing by the native vegetation panel. But on non-sensitive land farmers can self-assess whether the clearing is allowed.\n\nYet two years in the new regulations and the regulatory maps have not been completed. \u201cThe lack of a complete [native vegetation regulatory] map can make categorising land more difficult,\u201d the auditor general said in the report.\n\nMeanwhile, farmers in the north-west have embraced the exemptions in the legislation with gusto.\n\nIllegal land clearing cases decided by the courts bear this out. Many of them involve large-scale clearing motivated by economic gain \u2013 an aggravating factor under the law. These are not small-scale farmers caught out by unfair legislation.\n\nBirds sitting on a dead tree in a field outside Brewarrina NSW. Photograph: Mike Bowers for Guardian Australia\n\nKurstjens, Fitzgerald\u2019s neighbour, and his company Topview Brisbane Pty Ltd, were fined a total of $157,500 plus $185,000 in costs in the land and environment court in May 2017 for illegally clearing native vegetation on Beefwood between 2011 and 2012. The NSW Office of Environment and Heritage determined that at least 1,000 trees had been unlawfully cleared.\n\nKurstjens is now before the land and environment court again after environment authorities alleged he had cleared two new areas without consent. The department alleges the vegetation was neither regrowth nor ground cover and was not routine agricultural clearing.\n\nKurstjens did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment.\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s concerns about the change in the microclimate as a result of Kurstjens\u2019 clearing are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWork by the NSW government in 2014 on the impact of climate change on the state found that New England and north-west NSW had already warmed by about 1C and could expect 2.2C warming by 2070.\n\nClem Dodd, a Dharriwaa elder at Walgett, has seen the change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting drier, it\u2019s there for everyone to see,\u201d he says. \u201cYou knock all the trees out, you got no moisture in the ground. And you get no moisture in the ground, you get no clouds, and you get no rain. All you get is dust.\u201d\n\nLand clearing in a paddock on a back road outside Moree NSW. Photograph: Mike Bowers for Guardian Australia\n\nProf Clive McAlpine from University of Queensland explains that not only does land clearing release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, it also has an effect on climate, well beyond the emissions.\n\n\u201cIt causes warming locally, regionally and even globally, and it changes rainfall by altering the circulation of heat and moisture,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cTrees evaporate more water than any other vegetation type \u2013 up to 10 times more than crops and pastures. This is because trees have root systems that can access moisture deep within the soil.\u201d\n\nThe increased evaporation and rough surface of trees create moist, turbulent layers in the lower atmosphere, he says. \u201cThis reduces temperatures and contributes to cloud formation and increased rainfall. The increased rainfall then provides more moisture to soils and vegetation.\n\n\u201cThe clearing of deep-rooted native vegetation for shallow-rooted crops and pastures diminishes this process, resulting in a warmer and drier climate.\u201d\n\nMcAlpine argues that we should be replanting in the north-west of NSW and south-west Queensland to achieve a tree density of 40% to stabilise the local climate. Grazing would still be possible underneath the tree cover.\n\nSunrise over a field that remains empty of crops due to the lack of rainfall, outside Walgett NSW. Photograph: Mike Bowers for Guardian Australia\n\nBut all signs are that the NSW government wants to go in the other direction.\n\nAfter a campaign by the North West Farmers Alliance, aided by 2GB\u2019s Ben Fordham, the NSW government announced a review of prosecutions of farmers who were facing charges under the old native vegetation laws.\n\nThe agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, tells Guardian Australia the review \u2013 a kind of amnesty on prosecutions \u2013 was justified because \u201can independent review found the old Native Vegetation Act 2003 was delivering poor outcomes for both agriculture and the environment\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt simply wasn\u2019t fair that landholders found themselves in a situation where they could be punished by a piece of legislation that we as a government repealed because it was ineffective.\u201d\n\nAs a National in the seat of Northern Tablelands, Marshall is acutely conscious of how this issue is playing in northern NSW. \u201cThe changes are all about delivering a fairer outcome and allowing farmers to get on with the important job of producing the state\u2019s food and fibre,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe new land management regime gives landholders greater opportunities to manage their land and enhance productivity, while also delivering record funding for private land and threatened species conservation.\u201d\n\nMarshall says since the laws were introduced \u201cmore than 60,000 hectares of high-quality land has been set aside in perpetuity\u201d. He points to 31,714 hectares through offset agreements (where farmers agree to put bushland aside in return for permission to clear) and 29,000 hectares through payments from the Biodiversity Conservation Trust, which is a fund to support conservation.\n\nThe vast majority of clearing under the new laws has been to manage invasive native species, he says. The government is now assessing the 156 cases in the pipeline and will only proceed with those that would be breaches of the new laws.\n\nDry paddocks along the Moree-Collarenebri road, NSW. Photograph: Mike Bowers for Guardian Australia\n\nBut Walmsley from the EDO says the decision to discontinue prosecutions sends \u201ca terrible signal\u201d: that people can disregard environmental laws if they think they are going to change in the future.\n\nA few weeks ago the Natural Resources Commission sounded the alarm, warning that the loss of woody vegetation in NSW had passed a secret 20,000-hectare threshold agreed when the legislation was passed.\n\nIt has triggered a review which will go to cabinet soon. But whether Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s government is prepared to revisit legislation that is designed to give farmers a freer hand remains to be seen.\n\nThe environment minister, Matt Kean, says the answer lies not in trying to enforce laws on privately owned land but in extending public conservation. He has said he wants to add 200,000 hectares to the state\u2019s national parks estate by 2022, which would represent a 10-fold increase in the rate of creation of national parks under the current Coalition government.\n\nEnvironmentalists welcomed his ambition but so far there is no budget to buy land, let alone a commitment to the resources to run an expanded national park network.\n\nIn the north-west the need to act is urgent because the remnant bushland is now so fragmented that ecosystems are at breaking point.\n\n\u201cWe have already pushed the loss of vegetation past a reasonable level so we should be looking for policies to get net gain,\u201d Possingham says. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean every tree is sacred but we have to realise that land clearing costs this country.\u201d\n\nHe says preserving native vegetation and restoring it is absolutely essential for Australia to meet its climate obligations.\n\n\u201cThere are a variety of ecosystem services that natural habitat provides. The most obvious is keeping carbon in the ground and not in the air. It\u2019s a major part of our path to avoiding a climate catastrophe.\u201d", "description": "An epidemic of land clearing is sabotaging efforts to address climate change.
