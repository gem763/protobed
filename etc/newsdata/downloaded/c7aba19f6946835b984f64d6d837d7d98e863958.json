But Scherzer threw one scoreless inning with three strikeouts in Game 2 Friday as the Nationals won 4-2 to even the series with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThis likely sets Scherzer up to start Game 4 on Monday at 6:40 p.m., which could decide the best-of-five series.\n\nThe 35-year-old S\u00e1nchez is 1-3 with a 3.53 ERA in nine career starts against the Dodgers. That includes a mark of 1-1 and a 3.18 ERA in two starts this season.\n\nHe has not pitched since Sept. 25, when he gave up two runs and six hits in seven innings in a win over the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
