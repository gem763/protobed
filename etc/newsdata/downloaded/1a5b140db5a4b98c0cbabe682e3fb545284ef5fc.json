Photo: Getty Images\n\nThis week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The decision came after days of news reports about a complaint from an anonymous whistle-blower, who claimed that, in a phone call on July 25, President Trump tried to pressure Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice-president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. The saga is expansive, complex. Also involved? Two and a Half Men star Ashton Kutcher.\n\nAccording to the website TooFab.com, Kutcher and his wife Mila Kunis (who was born in the Ukrainian SSR) met with president Zelensky this month, and afterward, the actor concluded that President Trump should be impeached.\n\n\u201cMila and I met with President Zelenski [sic] and his wife a little over a week ago,\u201d Kutcher wrote to his followers on the website Community.com. \u201cMy gut: He is committed to eliminating corruption in Ukraine. He\u2019s also committed to ending the war and grateful for the US financial commitment because they needed it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf our president used that financial aid to leverage president Zelensky to investigate Biden he should be impeached. If our president did not use it as leverage and simply encouraged president Zelensky to investigate Biden without cause he should be impeached.\u201d\n\nTo learn more, the Cut texted Kutcher, who regularly encourages his fans and followers on Twitter to text him instead.\n\nJust text me it\u2019s easier. +1 (319) 519-0576 \u2014 ashton kutcher (@aplusk) July 23, 2019\n\nI was intrigued, in particular, by this tweet, which was probably a reference to all of the stories that have been coming out about Demi Moore, Kutcher\u2019s ex-wife, and her new memoir, Inside Out, in which she accuses Kutcher of cheating on her after pushing her to do threesomes together. But maybe Kutcher had some truth to share about Ukraine, or the impeachment proceedings \u2014 who knows.\n\nFor truth text me. +1 (319) 519-0576 \u2014 ashton kutcher (@aplusk) September 25, 2019\n\n\u201cHi Ashton, I\u2019m Madeleine Aggeler, a writer for New York Magazine\u2019s the Cut,\u201d I wrote. \u201cI saw on Twitter that you were inviting people to text you \u2018for truth.\u2019 Could you tell me what that truth is? Thanks!\u201d\n\nI immediately got a reply \u2014 an automatic text encouraging me to join Community.com so Kutcher could reply to me. Which I did. I sent the same text again. For a couple of hours, nothing happened. Then, my phone buzzed. Kutcher had answered. \u201cThings are getting spicy,\u201d he (or rather, his bot) said, with a link to a video.\n\nPhoto: Madeleine Aggeler\n\nWow, a video of him talking to the Ukrainian president, perhaps? A recording of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky?\n\nActually, it was this video of him eating hot wings.\n\nHopefully this clears up any confusion about the current impeachment proceedings for you.\n\nStay in touch.
