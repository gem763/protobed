It\u2019s a minor but welcome change that arrived with version 2.19.110 of the iOS app. The change applies for both individual and group chats.\n\nThe messaging app\u2019s mute feature is invaluable if you want to reduce distractions, particularly if you\u2019re a participant in any large group chats. Before the update, muting a chat would only stop your phone from vibrating and playing a notification sound when it received a new message, while doing nothing about the anxiety-inducing red notification badge placed on the app\u2019s icon on the home screen.\n\nThe new update only affects iOS users. On Android, meanwhile, WhatsApp has a separate \u201cShow notifications\u201d toggle which you can either tick or untick when you\u2019re muting a chat.", "description": "WhatsApp\u2019s latest update on iOS stops the app for showing a notification badge on its icon for chats that you\u2019ve muted.
