It is the aim to use parliamentary mechanisms to his advantage when there is opposition. Trump has tried similar moves, threatening court when someone suggests something he doesn\u2019t like and resorting to executive orders to try to push through money for projects like the border wall with Mexico.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Only one sitting Republican, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan has come out to express his lack of confidence in Trump \u2013 before quitting the party to become independent.\n\nConservative rebels have had little such fear \u2013 Phillip Lee this week crossed the floor to join the Lib Dems right in front of Johnson. He is one of a number to have expressed \u201cno confidence\u201d in their party leader. And how Trump would like to strip some Republicans of their voting rights over disloyalty!\n\nThe vocal opposition from within Johnson\u2019s own parliamentary benches has raised the pressure on him. While Trump has sought to ignore and lash out at critics, the prime minister has been forced to punish his \u2013 and has done so in a way the president would appreciate.\n\nTrump is not worried, though, and is happy to play up the relationship between the pair. \u201cHe\u2019s in there fighting and he knows how to win,\u201d the president said from the White House. \u201cBoris knows how to win. Don\u2019t worry about him, he\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\nBoth men have also put their stock in voters \u2013 increasingly small pools at that. Trump cares only for himself and appealing to his supporter base, which is just big enough to return him to the White House if they come out in numbers similar to 2016. For Johnson, the catchment group is proportionally larger \u2013 52 per cent of the country voted to leave the EU that same year \u2013 but unlike Trump, he has the Brexit Party trying to hoover up his supporters. But with an election likely, Johnson\u2019s aping of Trump may only get worse.\n\nJohnson may make noises about appealing to floating voters \u2013 but in reality he is trying to win over the Leave contingent, and is alienating much of the rest of the country as he does so, as like Trump. Both leaders are happy to gamble, but it may not pay off.", "description": "For political satirists and journalists alike, the similarities between Boris Johnson and Donald Trump are stacking up.
