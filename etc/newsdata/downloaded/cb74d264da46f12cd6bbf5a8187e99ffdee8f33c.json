But they also called the front desk to settle bets and check the circumference of the Earth.\n\nSome people still do.\n\nIt's not a service per se, just a tradition that never went away.\n\n\"We have people coming in and talking to us, people sending us e-mails,\" said Stephanie Kurmey, the senior manager of Frances Morrison Library's central access.\n\nFrances Morrison is the main branch for Saskatoon and fields most of the quirky calls.\n\nStephanie Kurmey has worked in libraries small and large, including a university library. Her move to Saskatoon libraries has brought her back to her rural beginnings and the little-known services left over from years ago. (Bridget Yard/CBC)\n\nThe story goes that libraries have always been the place to find information \u2014 any information \u2014 and that librarians could find an answer for even the most obscure query.\n\nThe phone rings a lot less these days and the questions are of a different nature.\n\nSome callers don't have access to the Internet. Some have trouble with basic calculations.\n\n\"We have a patron who's been calling for quite a few years,\" said Kurmey. \"There's no calculator at home and it's just sort of quick little things.\"\n\nSometimes patrons throw front-desk staff a softball, like \"How do you become a librarian?\"\n\nRemember that recipe from 10 years go?\n\nThe Frances Morrison Library in Saskatoon is the main branch for the city. (Guy Quenneville/CBC)\n\nThe advent of the Blackberry, and the smartphone revolution it heralded, changed everything. In 2019 it is unusual not to have a cellphone with access to the Internet and all the information it contains.\n\nBut what about that recipe you saw in the paper 10 years ago? All you can remember about it is that it had rhubarb and honey.\n\n\"We can actually go in and find that for them and we can read it over the phone,\" said Kurmey.\n\nCooking shows on television ask the viewer to go to their website after the show for more details. Some people don't have a computer to look up the instructions, or they can't navigate the site.\n\nLibrarians to the rescue.\n\nOur place isn't really to release judgment, which is tricky. So we offer people facts. - Amanda Lepage, Saskatoon Public Libraries\n\nThe patrons in search of recipes are generally older than those who used to ask for the number of bridges in any given city.\n\nTheir questions have morphed into requests for essential information and accessibility.\n\nA widower relied on his wife to select books and bring them home to him. After her death, he had difficulty both getting to the library and communicating with staff once he got there.\n\nThe patron was paired with an outreach social worker who helped him navigate the library to accommodate his limited speech.\n\nFacts, not opinions\n\nThe Q&A service falls under welcoming initiatives at the library. Amanda Lepage is the senior manager and leads staff in an effort to reduce barriers to library services.\n\n\"Or just general barriers to life,\" she said.\n\nWhen patrons are unable to access the library in person, librarians find a way to deliver information to them anyway. (Jim Lebans/CBC )\n\nNewcomers to the city often reach for the telephone in search of a guide. They ask where the nearest grocery store is located or which neighbourhood is the safest.\n\n\"Our place isn't really to release judgment, which is tricky. So we offer people facts,\" said Lepage.\n\nPatrons are often referred to social workers available at the library to help them access other services they need, but there are still many thing the welcome desk can help with.\n\nRecently an outreach worker explained Kijiji to someone looking for housing. They set up viewings on the patron's cell phone.\n\nI just can't get there\n\nA staple of the Saskatoon Public Library \u2014 and libraries all around the world \u2014 is its commitment putting books in the hands of those who treasure them.\n\nSmall libraries have long stood in the retirement and care homes of Saskatoon.\n\nThough it's labour intensive, a courier service left over from years ago still exists and still gets used. It's called the \"home reader program\" and delivers words that some patrons might never have had the chance to read.\n\n\"They're living on their own,\" said Lepage. \"They do like to read and some people, in wintertime, they just can't navigate the sidewalks with the snow and ice.\"\n\nLibrarians ask callers a few questions to determine exactly what kind of service they need arrange for the books to be delivered. The next time they visit, couriers pick up the old books and bring them a fresh selection.", "description": "Librarians in the city still take burning questions over the phone.
