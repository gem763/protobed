He remembers the meeting where an executive mused that perhaps the whole department could be shipped to India. He wondered how much notice he would get, and what his severance would be, and how he would tell his wife.\n\nMr. Kincaid didn\u2019t need to have that conversation. He kept his job. While he later left the company, he has remained steadily employed a decade and a half later. And the broader jobs apocalypse never materialized.\n\nCompanies did move millions of office jobs to India, the Philippines and other places where they could pay workers less. But those job losses were more than balanced by growth elsewhere in the economy.", "description": "Economists once warned that office jobs in the United States would soon follow factory jobs in moving overseas. New research suggests that jobs may be moving to other parts of the country instead.", "authors": ["Ben Casselman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/business/26offshoring1/26offshoring1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
