In that weekend essay, Continetti asserted, \u201cThere is nothing so consistent as American ambivalence toward our superpower status. Most great powers covet hegemony. We hate it. The costs are too high, the demands too stressful.\u201d He concluded, with respect to Syria, \u201cif what\u2019s happening is a betrayal of American values, it\u2019s one Americans voted for.\u201d\n\nAs President Trump has made Syria worse, I have heard kindred arguments from both ends of the political spectrum. Sure, the narrative runs, Trump is withdrawing from Syria in the messiest way possible, but isn\u2019t this what the American people wanted? Don\u2019t they want the forever wars in the Middle East to end? Surely they don\u2019t want a return of the hawks, right?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is striking about arguments like these is the near-complete absence of any discussion of public opinion polling to buttress their argument. If the Blob\u2019s policy preferences are truly disconnected from those of the American public, that would be a powerful populist talking point. This has been made in the past with a heavy reliance on polling data. Both Trumpists and progressives should be trumpeting public opinion surveys from the rooftops that highlight the disconnect with the Blob.\n\nThey are not doing that, however, and I think I know why. It turns out that what the American people want in foreign policy looks an awful lot like what the Blob wants.\n\nLet\u2019s take Syria as an example. This should be an easy test for populists, since by the middle of 2018 Islamic State forces in the country had been captured, killed or expelled. The United States is in Syria on dubious legal grounds. Surely, when Trump proposed withdrawing U.S. forces in January, Americans supported it?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs it turns out, not so much. According to a January 2019 Pew survey, \u201c43% of Americans say withdrawing American troops from Syria would be the right decision, while 45% say it would be the wrong decision.\u201d This does not sound like a public that has a clear opinion on the topic.\n\nOf course, that was back in January. As Trump has been hammering home this theme, the American people have shifted toward his position, yes?\n\nWell, they have shifted. According to three polls this week, however, they\u2019re moving away from Trump\u2019s position. A Quinnipiac poll found that 60 percent of voters disapproved of Trump\u2019s withdrawal of support for the Kurds, compared with 30 percent support. A Morning Consult poll on the question found that 52 percent of respondents disapproved of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, while only 28 percent approved. The University of Maryland\u2019s Shibley Telhami has also been polling this month, and his results are similar: \u201cOn October 7, support for his move was low, with only 27% of respondents saying they supported it. ... Within two days ... support for the decision declined further to 21%, and opposition increased from 42% to 46%.\u201d A FiveThirtyEight review by Dhrumil Mehta of recent polling suggests similar results: a public that is more opposed to Trump\u2019s Syria policy than it was in January.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI do not want to exaggerate these findings. Telhami also finds majority support for a reduction of U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Clearly, the American people are not solidly in favor of keeping U.S. troops in Syria. A plurality of respondents clearly are, however, and public sentiment has shifted away from Trump in this area.\n\nThis jibes with recent Chicago Council polling on overall public attitudes toward America\u2019s role in the world. (Full disclosure: I\u2019m on the foreign policy advisory board that consulted with and provided feedback for this survey.)\n\nWhether they identify as Democrats, Independents, or Republicans, large numbers of Americans continue to favor the foundational elements of traditional, post\u2013World War II US foreign policy. They express continued or increased support for security alliances and military deterrence by maintaining superior military capabilities and US bases abroad. They believe international trade is good for the United States and American companies, and that promoting democracy and human rights around the world makes the United States safer. In fact, support for NATO, military alliances, and trade have never been higher in the history of the Chicago Council Survey. Placed within the context of the 45-year history of the Chicago Council Survey, the most striking conclusion is how consistently Americans support a foreign policy based on shared leadership, strong alliances, free trade, and the selective use of military force to defend the United States and its allies.\n\nAmericans will never be as hawkish as Continetti or neoconservatives want them to be, and thank God for that. The idea, however, that there is some yawning gap between the American public and the American foreign policy community is simply not borne out by the data. Whatever gap used to exist has narrowed considerably. It is disingenuous of Domenech and others to suggest otherwise. Indeed, if there is a gap between the public and elected officials, it is that the public is way less protectionist than most folks running for president.\n\nNone of this is to say that the Blob or the American people are right about any particular foreign policy issue. I am all for serious debates about the future of American foreign policy. But advocates of restraint need to stop claiming that the Blob is acting in an undemocratic manner. Because it just ain\u2019t so.\n\nAD", "description": "Populists sure don't like to talk about public opinion when it comes to foreign policy.", "authors": ["Daniel W. Drezner", "Daniel W.
