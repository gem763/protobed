But Page feels such concerns have been exaggerated.\n\n\"I do think there is a lot of folklore about the weather - it is probably less important than it sounds,\" Page said on Good Morning Europe.\n\n\"Remember millions and millions of people will not cast their votes by post so the weather will not affect them too much.\n\n\"We all have central heating now which we didn't in the 1920s and the evidence is weather affects it much less than one might imagine.\"\n\nA more relevant factor concerning whether or not the Conservatives will get the majority is perhaps Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.\n\nBrexiters have urged Farage's movement and the Conservatives to agree on an election pact to avoid them taking votes from each other.\n\nYou can watch the full report in the video player, above.", "description": "The UK has taken a major step towards a snap general election - but will Boris Johnson's Conservatives get the majority they need to push through Brexit?", "authors": ["Joao Vitor Da Silva Marques"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/85/62/1000x563_cmsv2_c9cc4fec-16fc-5d0c-ac5d-a0d91a5be8b8-4268562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
