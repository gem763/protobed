If that photo is seen by the wrong person, they can hack into your personal accounts.\n\nHow? All a hacker needs is a frequent flyer membership number, a passenger\u2019s name (both printed on boarding passes), and to guess the password (often easily done), and they\u2019ll have access to someone\u2019s frequent flyer account.\n\nFIRST LOOK INSIDE QANTAS\u2019 REFURBISHED A380\n\nTHE REAL REASON FLIGHT CREW CHECK YOUR BOARDING PASS\n\nYOU DON\u2019T WANT THIS ON YOUR BOARDING PASS\n\nFrequent flyer numbers will no longer be printed on Qantas boarding passes. Picture: Qantas\n\nA Qantas spokesperson confirmed the change to Executive Traveller, saying the numbers were being removed \u201cto maintain customer privacy\u201d. The numbers have already been removed from digital boarding passes, and \u201cwill gradually come off physical boarding passes over the next few weeks\u201d.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, a passenger\u2019s frequent flyer status will remain, so members can still flash their boarding passes for access to airport lounges, priority boarding lanes, and other perks.\n\n\u201cCustomers\u2019 tier status (eg Gold or Platinum) remains visible on boarding passes and Qantas Frequent Flyer numbers can also be found within the Qantas App and on digital Qantas Frequent Flyer cards,\u201d the Qantas spokesperson said.\n\nWhile passengers themselves are ultimately responsible for their own online security, Qantas has made the change as a gesture to help protect its passengers.\n\nPosting boarding pass selfies to social media isn\u2019t worth the bragging rights.\n\nTravel expert David Flynn, editor-in-chief of Executive Traveller, says most people don\u2019t realise how much data is \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d on their boarding passes.\n\n\u201cThe frequent flyer number isn\u2019t a must-have (on boarding passes), so Qantas is taking a small but sensible step to help passengers to protect their privacy,\u201d he says.\n\nBut even with the frequent flyer numbers removed, Flynn warns that \u201cboarding passes contain a treasure-trove of details relating to not only your frequent flyer profile but your whole trip\u201d.\n\n\u201cA simple snapshot of your boarding pass on social media can be used to access your booking online at the airline\u2019s website, so somebody with malicious intent could do anything from changing your seat to cancelling your flight.\u201d\n\nEven the barcode contains precious information.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of readily-available home computer software which can decipher that barcode \u2014 even from a photo of the boarding pass \u2014 and reveal everything about your booking, \u201d Flynn says.\n\nEven boarding pass barcodes can be deciphered with home computer software.\n\nThe best advice for passengers is obviously to never post photos of boarding passes online, but Flynn says if you really want to do it, there is a safe way.\n\n\u201cPhoto-editing software is available for your phone to blur out the barcode, your frequent flyer details, and any E-ticket reference number.\n\n\u201cBut the safest place for your boarding pass is in your travel wallet, not on the internet.\u201d\n\nQANTAS AND WOOLIES SWEETEN POINTS DEAL\n\nTHE NEW RULES TO SCORING A QANTAS UPGRADE", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ca7a53936e7f1af619656f19ebacbdcd", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
