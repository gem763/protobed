The other pilot replied that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a lie, no one told us that was the case\u201d that the MCAS caused issues.\n\nThe FAA said in a statement on Saturday that Boeing shared a transcript of the messages with the agency on Friday, but the aircraft manufacturer first discovered documentation of the exchange months ago.\n\nAfter reviewing the document FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg a letter calling the information \u201cconcerning\u201d and pressing the company to explain why it didn\u2019t share the transcript earlier. \u201cI expect your explanation immediately regarding the content of this document and Boeing\u2019s delay in disclosing the document to its safety regulators,\u201d Dickson wrote.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Boeing gave the transcript to the U.S. Department of Justice this week to prepare them for hearings in which Muilenburg is set to testify as a part of the agency\u2019s criminal investigation.\n\nReached for comment by Gizmodo, Boeing did not explain why it only shared the transcript with the FAA this week, but a spokesperson said the company has been cooperating with the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee\u2019s investigation into the 737 Max for the last several months.\n\n\u201cAs part of that cooperation, today we brought to the Committee\u2019s attention a document containing statements by a former Boeing employee,\u201d a Boeing spokesperson told Gizmodo. \u201cWe will continue to cooperate with the Committee as it continues its investigation. And we will continue to follow the direction of the FAA and other global regulators, as we work to safely return the 737 Max to service.\u201d\n\nLast week, American Airlines said it expects its fleet of 737 Max aeroplanes to start flying on January 16, 2020. How many people it expects to fly on those planes is an open question.", "description": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has accused Boeing of withholding an exchange between two employees showing their concerns about the 737 Max\u2019s malfunctioning automated system a full two years before crashes occurred in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed a total of 346 people....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Julie Muncy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/oeqdmqjzt6bgesotz0zh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
