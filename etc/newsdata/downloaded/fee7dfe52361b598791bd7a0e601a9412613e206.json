However, alluvial mining, where the gold is in a stream bed rather than an underground seam, still contributes some of the country\u2019s output.\n\nAlluvial (or artisanal) gold mining in Russia is usually small-scale, but is still conducted by officially registered firms, which are supposed to abide by health and safety rules.\n\nKrasnoyarsk officials said water released by the dam partially flooded two dormitories of the rotational camp in which 74 people lived, adding that 13 people were still missing.\n\nA Russian investigative committee said it had launched a criminal investigation into violation of safety rules at the gold mining spot, while local authorities said the collapsed dam was not registered by official bodies.\n\nInterfax said the miners were part of the Siberian privately held company Sibzoloto, which unites several artisanal mining teams.\n\nSibzoloto was not immediately available for comment.\n\nSibzoloto produced about three tonnes of gold in 2018, Sergei Kashuba, the head of Russia\u2019s Gold Industrialists\u2019 Union, a non-government producers\u2019 lobby group, said. Sibzoloto is not a member of the union, he added.\n\nRussia produced 314 tonnes of gold in 2018.", "description": "Investigation launched into safety regime at alluvial mine in remote Krasnoyarsk region", "authors": ["Reuters In Moscow"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af65c7c19056405adb122174fdb392cbf310f64/3_598_4003_2402/master/4003.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fba23e5834f6edf076a81e21093cb7ab", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
