Four years later, Mitt Romney pulled two top staffers from the ground here with weeks to go before Election Day \u2014 admitting defeat even before Barack Obama trounced him by 51 points in the Santa Fe suburbs.\n\nThe Land of Enchantment has voted for a Republican presidential candidate only once since 1992. With a considerable nonwhite voter population and all-Democratic congressional delegation, it\u2019s not exactly fertile ground for a surprise GOP victory.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut then, President Donald Trump has seldom shied away from a long-shot challenge.\n\nDespite the Democratic Party\u2019s statewide success here last November \u2014 winning two congressional seats up for grabs, defending a third and defeating Republican nominee Steve Pearce for the governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 Trump and his aides are betting they can flip New Mexico next fall and expand his electoral playing field.\n\nTheir efforts begin Monday night with a campaign rally in Rio Rancho, which sits in a county Trump lost by 1,800 votes in 2016. The Hispanic-heavy city is four hours north of El Paso, Texas, where the president held a reelection rally in August that prompted campaign manager Brad Parscale to add New Mexico to his \u201cwatch list\u201d \u2014 a list of nontraditional battleground states, including Maine, Colorado, Minnesota and Virginia, that the Trump campaign has its sights set on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve continued to say the president\u2019s policies are a win for Latino voters across America \u2026 and one of the first symbols of this was the El Paso rally,\u201d Parscale told reporters on a call last week. \u201cWe saw in the data thousands of voters who did not vote for the president in 2016 show up to a rally, come listen to the president and register [to vote].\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we started doing polling there, we saw a dramatic increase from 2016 and I went over this with the president and he said, \u2018Let\u2019s go straight into Albuquerque,\u2019\u201d Parscale recalled.\n\nPolitical forecasters and local officials remain puzzled by claims that Trump \u2014 with his restrictionist immigration policies, white-identity politics and below-average approval ratings \u2014 can woo enough voters to turn New Mexico in his favor.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen of the president\u2019s immigration policy has been cruel and inhumane. I think Democrats and New Mexicans, in general, are much more interested in making sure our communities feel welcome and safe,\u201d said Miranda van Dijk, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of New Mexico, which is counterprogramming Trump\u2019s rally with an event focused on \u201cunity and diversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a batshit racist,\u201d adds Chris Luchini, a New Mexico native who sits atop the state\u2019s Libertarian Party. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical that New Mexico is up for grabs with him.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Luchini contends that the party has become somewhat of a refuge for disaffected Democrats who are too conservative for the progressive politics of their state legislature, but too appalled by Trump to re-register as Republicans.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, the normal thing that most political operatives have believed is that people who vote Libertarian are disaffected Republicans. That is no longer true in New Mexico,\u201d he explained.\n\nLuchini said he often calls voters when they re-register as Libertarian to ask what prompted the change, \u201cand what I get on the phone calls a lot are traditional conservative Democrats who can no longer stomach being called a Democrat, but are self-selected not to be Trump voters.\u201d\n\nThe trend he describes is consistent with the Trump campaign\u2019s attraction to New Mexico, though questions remain about whether the current political climate here is truly advantageous for the president. His net approval rating in the state has decreased by 34 percentage points since he took office, and recent matchup polls in bordering red Texas have shown him losing to the top three candidates in the Democratic presidential field.\n\nBut Trump campaign officials say the numbers they\u2019re looking at paint a different picture of a state where Hispanic Catholics and rural voters feel abandoned by progressive lawmakers who have pushed to codify reproductive rights, increase taxes and mandate the creation of gender-neutral restrooms in commercial buildings. Furthermore, they maintain that the president\u2019s actions on immigration are attractive to a particular subset of Hispanic voters who support border security or have family members who entered the U.S. legally.\n\nThat is, only if Trump can ditch the harsh rhetoric he typically employs when discussing his immigration policies and preferences, says Pearce, the failed gubernatorial candidate, who has spoken to the campaign about the president\u2019s language in his current capacity as chairman of New Mexico\u2019s Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot about tone, and you\u2019ve got to watch that,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be cautious about saying you want to secure the border. You just have to say it with firmness and without anger.\u201d\n\nRepublicans in New Mexico are also eyeing retiring Democrat Tom Udall\u2019s Senate seat as a means to boost voter turnout and help the president in 2020. Two Republican candidates have already declared \u2014 in addition to \u201c10 different people who are interested in running,\u201d whom Pearce says he has spoken to \u2014 though neither is viewed as particularly competitive in what is seen as a relatively safe seat for Democrats.\n\nStill, van Dijk says Democratic activists and state party officials are \u201cnot taking anything for granted\u201d for this cycle and will focus heavily on defending Udall\u2019s seat and appealing to voters from every corner of the state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about supporting our eventual nominee for Senate and lucky to have an incredible county party structure,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are in every part of our state and we\u2019re making sure our initiatives are focused in every part of our state.\u201d\n\nBy Parscale\u2019s telling, Trump \u2014 who hasn\u2019t visited New Mexico since October 2016 \u2014 has long been eager to return. Campaign officials believe that Johnson attracted tens of thousands of would-be Trump voters during the president\u2019s first White House bid. And if they can just win over those voters this cycle, it will bring Trump closer to having five more electoral votes in his pocket.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until mid-August, though, that Trump himself was convinced of the idea. The president has spent months polling his inner circle about the political landscape in New Mexico, according to two people familiar with those conversations, one of whom recalled his asking an aide whether coming here would be a waste of time.\n\n\u201cI started talking to them \u2014 saying they shouldn\u2019t write off New Mexico \u2014\u2013 in January. They didn\u2019t believe that in the least,\u201d Pearce said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cEventually Brad began to watch it, and three to four months ago he said he wanted to come into New Mexico and do a little something with the party, and that morphed into Don Jr. coming with him, and then the president started wanting to come about the time of his New Hampshire rally\u201d in August.\n\nWith an unprecedented war chest, the Trump campaign has ample cash to spend on watch-list states like New Mexico, where at least a half-dozen staffers are expected to be stationed before the end of the year. If Monday\u2019s rally meets expectations, the president could turn the state into a regular stop on the campaign trail as 2020 draws near \u2014 particularly if his prospects begin to dim in key battleground states.\n\n\u201cHe starts off with 164 electoral votes\u201d automatically, a Republican official familiar with Trump\u2019s strategy recently told POLITICO. \u201cWhat I would tell you is, I feel like he\u2019s going to win Texas, but I don\u2019t know that we have opportunities in Colorado, Virginia [or] New Mexico.\u201d", "description": "The strategy centers on wooing Hispanics in the state, which has voted for a Republican presidential candidate only once since 1992.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8b/b4/8f246ea440da969789211ef2eb94/190915-donald-trump-1ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
