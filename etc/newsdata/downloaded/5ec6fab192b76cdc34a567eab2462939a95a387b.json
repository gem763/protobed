Investigators say the feature, fed by faulty data from a sensor, repeatedly misfired, forcing the nose of both planes down before they crashed.\n\nIn a letter to President Trump on Monday, Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner wrote that the \u201cFAA\u2019s official responses to Congress appear to have been misleading in their portrayal of FAA employee training and competency.\u201d\n\nInformation provided by the FAA \u201cobfuscates\u201d concerns about the preparation of safety inspectors and \u201cdiverts attention away from the likely truth of the matter: that they were neither qualified under agency policy to certify pilots flying the 737 Max nor to assess pilot training on procedures and maneuvers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FAA is entrusted with the critically important role of ensuring aircraft safety,\u201d Kerner added in a statement. \u201cThe FAA\u2019s failure to ensure safety inspector competency for these aircraft puts the flying public at risk.\u201d\n\nLong before the Max disasters, Boeing had a history of failing to fix safety problems\n\nIn a statement, the FAA said: \u201cWe are reviewing the Special Counsel\u2019s letter. We remain confident in our representations to Congress and in the work of our aviation safety professionals. Aviation safety is always our foremost priority, and we look forward to responding to the concerns that have been raised.\u201d\n\nOn April 2, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, queried the acting FAA administrator about claims from whistleblowers \u201cthat numerous FAA employees, including those involved in the Aircraft Evaluation Group (AEG) for the Boeing 737 Max, had not received proper training and valid certifications.\u201d\n\nWicker also wrote that some of those employees may have been part of an FAA group, known as a Flight Standardization Board, formed to \u201cdevelop minimum training recommendations\u201d \u2014 specifically for the new Max jets \u2014 and ensure that pilots have all the necessary information to safely fly them.\n\nWicker wrote that the FAA \u201cmay have been notified about these deficiencies as early as August 2018\u201d and that the committee \u201cis led to believe that an FAA investigation into these allegations may have been completed recently.\u201d\n\nChanges to flawed Boeing 737 Max were kept from pilots, DeFazio says\n\nThere had indeed been an investigation by the FAA\u2019s Office of Audit and Evaluation, which considers whistleblower cases and other internal and external reports of aviation safety violations. That office is meant to provide an \u201cindependent venue for the conduct or oversight of objective, impartial investigations and evaluations,\u201d according to the FAA, and it reports to the FAA\u2019s top official.\n\nOn April 4, then-acting FAA administrator Daniel K. Elwell responded to Wicker, saying, \u201cwe can confirm that all of the flight inspectors who participated in the Boeing 737 Max Flight Standardization Board certification activities were fully qualified for these activities.\u201d\n\nOn May 2, Elwell added that \u201cIt is not accurate . . . to suggest that this whistleblower disclosure and investigation implicated the qualifications of the Boeing 737 Max Flight Standardization Board (FSB) and the FSB\u2019s evaluation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.\u201d\n\nIn a letter dated June 3, the Trump administration\u2019s top lawyer at the Transportation Department, Steven G. Bradbury, wrote to Kerner saying that the \u201cFAA has confirmed\u201d that qualifications of Max inspectors were not an issue. Bradbury said the whistleblower\u2019s \u201callegations have already been investigated.\u201d\n\nBut Kerner, whom Trump appointed in 2017, said his investigators \u201cobtained internal FAA communications and conducted employee interviews, which adduced credible information directly contradicting the [FAA\u2019s] assertions\u201d to the Senate Commerce Committee.\n\nFAA and Boeing defend oversight of 737 Max\n\nThe information \u201cspecifically concerns the 737 Max and casts serious doubt on the FAA\u2019s public statements regarding the competency of agency inspectors who approved pilot qualifications for this aircraft,\u201d wrote Kerner, who served on the House Oversight Committee under Republican chairmen Darrell Issa (Calif.) and Jason Chaffetz (Utah) and worked on investigations for the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz).\n\nKerner wrote that emails reviewed by his office \u201cshow serious concerns\u201d within the Office of Audit and Evaluation \u201cregarding the veracity of the agency\u2019s public statements, particularly after the FAA\u2019s final response was transmitted to the Committee.\u201d\n\nThe FAA\u2019s Office of Audit and Evaluation \u201cdetermined\u201d that safety inspectors for the Max \u201chad not met qualification standards. Specifically, these [inspectors] had not received formal classroom training as required by\u201d two FAA orders, Kerner wrote. Another FAA division agreed with that interpretation, but \u201cthis information does not appear in the final\u201d Office of Audit and Evaluation report on inspector training issues, according to Kerner.\n\nAn attorney with the Office of Special Counsel said the office \u201cwill not speculate as to why this information does not appear.\u201d\n\nEuropean pilots say FAA, Boeing moving too fast toward lifting Boeing 737 Max ban\n\nA point of disagreement has been whether FAA orders require aviation safety inspectors to have both formal classroom training as well as on-the-job training to do their jobs. Elwell, for example, had argued that there were \u201cambiguities in the FAA\u2019s policy\u201d regarding training requirements for safety inspectors and said the whistleblower\u2019s concerns \u201cprovided the FAA with an opportunity to improve our internal systems and procedures.\u201d\n\nAn April memo prepared for Elwell by Ali Bahrami, the FAA\u2019s top safety official, argued that while FAA officials at a key division \u201cbelieve formal training should be required, the current guidance language allows either formal training\u201d or on-the-job training.\n\nThe Office of Audit and Evaluation reported in February that it had reviewed training records for all aviation safety inspectors assigned to an office in Seattle, where the Boeing 737 Max was evaluated, and in Long Beach, where questions about inspector training were first raised by the whistleblower concerning a separate Gulfstream aircraft.\n\nThe FAA auditors \u201cfound 16 of 22 (73%) have not completed the required formal training course. Worse yet, at least 11 of the 16 do not qualify to enroll in the course because they do not hold a Certified Flight Instructor certificate,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAmong those lacking needed classroom training were the three members of the Flight Standardization Board for the Boeing 737 Max, according to the Office of Special Counsel.\n\nAs the investigations into the Max crashes continue, the FAA met Monday in Montreal with dozens of international aviation regulators. Although U.S. officials had hoped for broad global agreement on when to allow the plane to fly again, FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson seemed to acknowledge that will come in phases, saying the agency is primed to help \u201cas you make your own decisions about returning the Max to service.\u201d\n\nNoting that \u201caccidents in complex systems rarely are the result of a single cause,\u201d Dickson also said international regulators will need to target \u201cimprovements in standards and approaches for not just . . . how aircraft are designed and produced, but how they are maintained and operated.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. Office of Special Counsel said the agency\u2019s \u201cfailure to ensure safety inspector competency\u201d puts the flying public at risk.", "authors": ["Michael Laris", "Transportation Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YDJO2MG6GQI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
