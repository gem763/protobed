We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of trying to \u201chijack an election\u201d after new details from an intelligence agency whistleblower\u2019s complaint about a controversial call between the president and a foreign leader emerged Thursday.\n\nThe complaint details allegations that Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden and his son, but more notably draws out how high-ranking Trump administration officials allegedly tried to \u201clock down\u201d details of the call with Ukraine\u2019s newly-elected president Volodymyr Zelensky\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d like to get foreign help to win elections,\u201d Biden told a few dozen attendees at a campaign fundraiser in San Marino, Calif.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden (Photo: William Thomas Cain/Getty Images)\n\nThe comments from Biden were perhaps his strongest admonishment of Trump to date over the Ukraine controversy.\n\nIn the July 25 call, Trump encouraged Zelensky to work with Attorney General William Barr and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to look into the Bidens dealings in Ukraine, according to a summary of the call released by the White House.\n\nTrump and Giuliani for months have accused, without presenting evidence to back up their allegation, that Biden \u2014 while still serving as vice president \u2014 demanded the ouster of then-Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin because the prosecutor was investigating an oligarch tied to a company called Burisma Group. At the time, Hunter Biden was on the board of Ukraine's Burisma, a position that paid him $50,000 per month.\n\nThe former president \u2014 who is now a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 says that Trump has been attempting to sully him and his family without any evidence.\n\nBiden quoted an excerpt from the whistleblower\u2019s newly-declassified complaint alleging that Trump was seeking election help from Ukraine. He also pointed to a recent Washington Post report to make the case that there\u2019s not been \u201cone shred of evidence\u201d found showing wrongdoing by Biden\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing anybody in my family did wrong ... at all,\u201d Biden told the friendly crowd, according to a press pool report.\n\nA stain on Biden? Trump's efforts to discredit Joe Biden backfired on him. Will they hurt the former VP anyway?\n\nImpeachment: Donald Trump's wary White House deals with the threat of impeachment\n\nBiden made his comments hours after Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee on the ongoing controversy that has spurred a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday released a summary of a July 25 phone call that shows Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint released Thursday alleged White House staff took to exceptional steps to \"lock down\" all records of the Trump-Zelensky call after the conversation.\n\nThe declassified, partially redacted nine-page report alleges White House officials were \"directed\" to remove electronic records of the phone conversation from an internal computer system where the material is typically stored and instead the records were placed in a highly secure system reserved for classified information pertaining to national security matters.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/26/whistleblower-complaint-biden-says-trump-tried-hijack-election/3780823002/", "description": "The comments from former Vice President Joe Biden were perhaps his strongest-to-date over the Ukraine controversy.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Published P.M.
