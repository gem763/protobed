Kavanaugh, who was previously accused of sexual assault by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, was a student at Yale when the alleged incident occurred.\n\nThe article, \u201cBrett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not,\u201d reported the story of Deborah Ramirez, a fellow Yale student who claimed that at a dorm party Kavanaugh \"pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it.\"\n\nThe paper of record wrote, in a now-deleted tweet from their Opinion account, \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed she didn\u2019t belong at Yale in the first place.\u201d\n\nReaction to the grossly phrased tweet was swift and harsh.\n\nWriter Roxanne Gay, who is a contributor to the New York Times, called the tweet \u201csuch a profound lapse in judgment and common sense. Sexual assault isn\u2019t harmless fun. What the hell is going on at the NYT?\u201d\n\nFeminist author Jessica Valenti was equally disgusted, tweeting, \u201cI keep hearing how feminism has gone too far, yet here\u2019s the nation\u2019s most important newspaper calling sexual assault \u2018harmless fun.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe followed up with another tweet pointing out that the Times is an important publication and what they write can have a harmful impact, \u201cCalling this s*** \u2018harmless fun\u2019 is how you make it OK for another man to do this to another woman.\u201d\n\nPolitics writer Amanda Marcotte made a sharp observation in a tweet. \u201cWhat is doubly frustrating if that, if you\u2019ve ever seen or been on the receiving end of such \u2018fun,\u2019 you know the perpetrators do not think it harmless. The harm is the fun.\u201d\n\nShe continued, noting, \u201c\u2018Harmless\u2019 is how it\u2019s justified to others, leaning on sexist notions that women don\u2019t matter, so harming them is harmless.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho thought an act of sexual assault was harmless fun?\u201d added political strategist (and Nancy\u2019s daughter) Christine Pelosi.\n\nThe Times phrasing shocked many, and the paper deleted the tweet with an explanation that it was \u201cpoorly phrased.\u201d That tweet has also since been deleted.\n\nThe paper deleted its tweet following backlash.

It was offensive, and we apologize. https://t.co/gbUdweKbDg \u2014 New York Times Opinion (@nytopinion) September 15, 2019\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "\"Sexual assault isn't harmless fun,\" writer Roxane Gay said of the newspaper's tweet about the latest allegation of sexual misconduct facing the Supreme Court justice.", "authors": ["Tanya Edwards"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MHpEsXsmH7qES9nu31kchw--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/8e7bd2c0-d7db-11e9-afff-fe7151492a71", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
