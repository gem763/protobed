Those two factors are holding back the market and dampening the enthusiasm that some kind of cosmetic trade deal is on its way.\u201d\n\nHowever, rising Treasury yields did boost interest-rate sensitive financials .SPSY, which gained 0.8%.\n\nOn the economic front, U.S. retail sales increased in August at twice the rate analysts expected, according to the Commerce Department, suggesting that strong consumer spending will continue to support the longest-ever U.S. economic expansion.\n\n\u201cThe consumer is pretty cheerful,\u201d Cardillo added. \u201cGoing into the holiday season the consumer is likely to continue to spend, and that bodes well as far as the consumer-led economy is concerned.\u201d\n\nEbbing trade jitters and upbeat retail sales data helped U.S. Treasury yields reach multi-week highs, providing an attractive alternative to risk-averse investors.\n\nMarket participants now look to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its monetary policy meeting next week.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 37.07 points, or 0.14%, to 27,219.52, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.18 points, or 0.07%, to 3,007.39 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 17.75 points, or 0.22%, to 8,176.71.\n\nOf the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, five closed in the red, with real estate .SPLRCR suffering the largest percentage loss, 1.3%.\n\nMaterials .SPLRCM was the biggest percentage winner, gaining 1.1%.\n\nChipmaker Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) slipped 3.4% after the company missed quarterly revenue estimates late Thursday and said that while semiconductor demand has likely hit bottom, the timing of a recovery remains uncertain.\n\nProgressive Corp (PGR.N) fell 5.6% after the insurer reported a 36% year-on-year drop in August net income.\n\nLumber Liquidators Holdings Inc (LL.N) plunged 13.2% after founder Thomas Sullivan told Bloomberg he was holding off on plans to take the company private.\n\nTyson Foods Inc (TSN.N), the largest U.S. meat processor, advanced 2.0% on China\u2019s tariff exemption announcement.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 12, 2019.
