(Appleseed was also based on a manga by Shirow Masamune). Netflix first announced the series in a tweet last December, but there's still one thing that will surprise fans who were enticed by that initial announcement.\n\nNetflix has opted for 3DCG animation and an art style similar to that of Land of the Lustrous\u2014in other words, CGI that emulates hand-drawn anime. While that approach was critically acclaimed in that anime, it has been controversial in others, and it differs significantly from the artwork Netflix originally showed to promote the new series (pictured below).\n\nLittle else is known about this adaptation, other than that it will of course focus on Major Motoko Kusanagi. And the teaser doesn't offer up too many more details, so we're still in the dark here. A more informative trailer is likely in the coming months, and the series is set to premiere on Netflix in 2020.\n\nAlso, Netflix released trailers for a few other anime projects alongside this one, including The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened, Eden, and Levius.\n\nListing image by Netflix", "description": "The teaser is short, but it gives us a first look at an unexpected visual style.", "authors": ["Samuel Axon"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ghost-in-the-Shell-745x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
