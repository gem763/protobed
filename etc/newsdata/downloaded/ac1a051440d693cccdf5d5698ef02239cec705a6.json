He remains in the national side as one of the last survivors of a golden era that delivered a World Cup and two European Championships.\n\nRamos replaced Casillas as Spain captain in 2016. He intends to play for many years yet, saying that \u201cstatistics are there to beat\u201d when he equalled the goalkeeper\u2019s record of 167 caps last month.\n\n\u201cSergio Ramos wants to play until he\u2019s 40 and I think he\u2019ll get there because he\u2019s amazing, in every way,\u201d Spain coach Robert Moreno said last week.\n\n\u201cWe can only say great things about Sergio. His attitude has always been impeccable whenever we have called upon him.\u201d\n\nWhen Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique followed Xavi and called time on their Spain careers in 2018, they left Ramos as a bridge to the past, his array of trophies providing a base of experience from which the next generation might flourish.\n\nSince also replacing Casillas as Real Madrid captain in 2015 Ramos has piled up Champions League triumphs, but he is yet to preside over similar success as \u2018La Roja\u2019 leader.\n\nSpain were knocked out of Euro 2016 in the last 16 by Italy. They then suffered the humiliation of losing to unfancied hosts Russia on penalties at the World Cup two years later.\n\n\u2013 \u2018An example\u2019 \u2013\n\nHowever, his place in Spanish football history is secure and he is considered a leader by his fellow Spain internationals, despite his reputation as a practitioner of the game\u2019s darker arts.\n\n\u201cHe has an aura and he is an example to follow\u201d, said Spain midfielder Pablo Sarabia, who plays for Paris Saint-Germain and came through as a youngster under Ramos at Real Madrid.\n\n\u201cHe is an extraordinary player and he has this ability to bring people together. When you think about that number of games he has played for Spain, he is a role model.\u201d\n\nSpain have been impeccable in Euro qualifying. They lead Group F with a perfect 18 points and come into the international break with the chance to secure a place at next year\u2019s finals.\n\nThey can advance on Saturday if they beat Norway and other results take an unexpected turn, with either Malta upset Sweden or Romania fail to beat the Faroe Islands.\n\n\u201cWe have not won anything yet. We want to be first in our group and to collect all 30 points possible,\u201d said Ramos.\n\nRamos, who also intends to compete in the Tokyo Olympics next year, may have other records in his sights too.\n\nHe is only nine matches short of the European record for international appearances held by former Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and 17 shy of the world record set by Egypt\u2019s Ahmed Hassan.\n\nIf Ramos plays until he is 40 as he wishes, both are well within reach.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Sergio Ramos is set to overtake Iker Casillas and become his country\u2019s most capped player with his 168th international", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/1c1faf_seegio-ramos-is-ensured-place-in-spanish-football-history-winning-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
