Taylor, chair of the University of Texas at San Antonio's department of political science and geography, told China Daily that the bill's consequences will likely be economic and cultural \u2014 with reduced opportunities for US investment and fewer US tourists.\n\nTaylor said a stable Hong Kong serves everyone's interests, and the US should be concerned that the increasing acts of violence will only lead to greater chaos.\n\nMike Wong, vice-president of the San Francisco chapter of Veterans for Peace, said, \"We oppose any interference by elected US lawmakers to spend US tax dollars to support the illegal protesting in Hong Kong.\"\n\nWong's organization is leading a petition calling on US lawmakers to end interference in Hong Kong and pay attention to domestic problems such as homelessness, inadequate healthcare, housing and gun violence.\n\nLawrence Ma Yan-kwok, chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, said, politically, Hong Kong provides an angle for the US to make up a story or excuse to condemn China or possibly seek international condemnation. In addition, Ma said the act is a way for the US government to divert public attention from its own political or policy deficiencies.\n\nLia Zhu in San Francisco contributed to this story.", "description": "The United States House of Representatives' passage on Tuesday of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 has sparked strong opposition from China, which said it will take countermeasures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/17/5da77f8ca310cf3e97a1910d.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
