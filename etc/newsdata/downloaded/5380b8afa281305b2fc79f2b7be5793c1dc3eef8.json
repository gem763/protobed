Are Doing", "language": "en", "text": "In 2010, researchers from Harvard and Google put their heads together to determine that there are roughly 1,022,000 words in the English language. The Oxford English Dictionary lists around 600,000.\n\nEither way, that\u2019s a lot of words.

Lying is: No, Mom, honest, I didn\u2019t break Aunt Donna\u2019s Hummel. Or: No, Your Honor, I did not bilk my investors out of $4 million and abscond to Grand Cayman.", "description": "A lie is when you cover up or deflect.
