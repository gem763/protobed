I told y'all I wasn't playing with this relationship s***.\"\n\nOk, it could be worse at this point\u2026\n\nThen he attempted to get all mushy saying that his wife and baby Donte Jr \"are a family that will not be broken\".\n\nWant to join the family?

I miss her being skinny.\"\n\nAnd then just when you think it can't get any worse he does a call out to previous former girlfriends ( who clearly had a lucky escape!)\n\n\"And to my exes... this could've been you but I'm glad it's not b*****.\"\n\nThe charming fella then ends his allegedly romantic post with: \"OMG I cried y'all. We'll get rings soon - chill.\"\n\nSo naturally, it was only a matter of time before one of his Facebook friends screenshot his post, slapped emojis on their faces and shared it in the group That's It, I'm Wedding Shaming.\n\nWow - what a gentleman! Source: Facebook\n\n\"Can you say annulment?\"\n\nAnd rightly so - the guy was slammed and labelled \"trash\".\n\n\"Yo, he misses her skinny! He's about to be missing his head - holy s*** he better run when she sees this,\" one replied.\n\n\"If this post doesn't tell her he only married her to p*** off his ex, I don't know what well. HE WILL LEAVE YOU THE FIRST TIME HIS EX EVEN FARTS IN HIS DIRECTION GIRL,\" another warned.\n\n\"Could you imagine your husband telling you he 'missed you being skinny' as you're carrying his child,\" a third added incredulously.\n\nWhile another got all facetious about the outrageous post: \"C'mon guys. I'm sure this marriage was built on a solid foundation of mutual love, trust and respect and will last many years.\"\n\nIn response, one user quipped: \"Can you say annulment?\"", "description": "This guy is a keeper!!!!", "authors": ["Leesa Smith"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d006984b04535fd16ce213bc8a39c09b", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
