Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter - sparking a whistleblower complaint and now the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump on Friday evening told House Republicans that it was Perry who had teed up the July call with Ukraine, according to a person familiar with Trump\u2019s new comments who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conference call.\n\nBut Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, or a U.S. holdup in military aid to the country, the person said. Trump\u2019s remarks on the late Friday call was first reported by Axios.\n\nPerry, the former governor of Texas and up to now a lower-profile but active member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, has made repeated trips to Ukraine and met often with Ukranian officials, including Zelenskiy. Perry and his agency say his involvement with Ukraine was part of U.S. policy, predating the Trump administration, to increase U.S. natural gas, coal and other supplies to Eastern Europe to lessen Russia\u2019s control of the region\u2019s energy market.\n\n\u201cHe continues to believe that there is significant need for improved regional energy security,\u201d Hynes said. Perry was heading to Lithuania again Sunday night, and would meet with nearly two dozen European energy officials, including those from Ukraine, she said.\n\nHynes did not immediately answer questions Sunday about whether Perry had discussed the Trump administration\u2019s push for help investigating Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals in his meetings with Ukraine.\n\nBut Perry told an evangelical Christian news outlet, CBN News, in an interview aired Friday that he had never heard anyone in the administration bring up Biden or Biden\u2019s son, who served on a board of a Ukraine natural gas business, in dealings with Ukrainian officials.\n\n\u201cNot once, as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name - not the former vice president, not his son - ever mentioned,\u201d Perry told the outlet. \u201cCorruption was talked about in the country but it was always a relatively vague term of, you know, the oligarchs and this and that and what have you.\u201d\n\nHouse lawmakers in the impeachment probe are seeking information from Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the administration\u2019s approach to Ukraine.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A spokeswoman for Energy Secretary Rick Perry says Perry encouraged President Donald Trump to speak to the Ukrainian leader in a call at the center of a House impeachment probe.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ellen Knickmeyer", "Alan Fram"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/05/30/secretary_perry_utah_35416_c0-653-3875-2912_s1770x1032.jpg?14288d95680c0db649a3e1269932f84537fd7bd3", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
