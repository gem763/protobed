Your countries are littered with American bases\u2026 Attack them there and show us your defect-free jihad.\u201d\n\nA former Egyptian surgeon and right-hand man to al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, Zawahiri was instrumental in planning 9-11 as he and bin Laden enjoyed the protection of the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\nHe used the attack\u2019s 18th anniversary to take on Muslim scholars who forbid the killing of innocents, according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI.)\n\nZawahiri explained the killing process:\n\n\u201dAfter ensuring that his target is permissible in the light of the shari\u2019a, that no harm should occur to Muslims as a result of his actions, and that the benefits of his actions outweigh the costs, all he needs to do is to put his trust in Allah and head for his target after leaving a message that the aim of his jihad operation is avenging the crimes in Palestine and all such Muslim lands.\u201d\n\nMEMRI, which monitors jihadi communications and press statements, picked up the video on the Telegram app channel used by al Qaeda\u2019s media unit, Al-Shahab.\n\nNearly 3,000 people died when al Qaeda operatives commandeered American airliners and flew them into the twin towers in New York and the Pentagon, while heroic passengers on a fourth jet bound for Congress or the White House forced terrorists to crashed in a Pennsylvania field.\n\n\u201cWere those killed in the Pentagon innocent?\u201d Mr. Zawahiri said. \u201cOr was it the headquarters of the biggest military power in the world that was hit and host to the biggest criminals involved in crimes against Muslims? What about the airplane that was headed for the Congress or the White House? Was it also meant to target innocents?\u201d\n\nHe concluded by directing his hatred on the United State.\n\n\u201cAmerica only understands the language of force,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who inflict damage on America, America tries to negotiate and arrive at an understanding with them. Those who retreat in the face of its power, America doesn\u2019t spare them until it has completely overcome them. The Islamic Emirate dealt severe blows to America. This is why the Americans showed keenness to negotiate with them a withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThis was a reference to the collapsed talks between the Taliban, his longtime ally, and President Trump.\n\nLike bin Laden, Zawahiri escaped the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. Since then he has avoided detection, likely moving around tribal areas along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.\n\nNow 68, Zawahiri ascended to al Qaeda\u2019s top post with the killing of bin Laden by Navy SEALs in May 2011 in Pakistan. The U.S. State Department is offering a $25 million reward.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
