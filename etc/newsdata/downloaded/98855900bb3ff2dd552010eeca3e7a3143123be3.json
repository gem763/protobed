That\u2019s why I picked him.\n\n\u201cHis interview beamed out of the television, what he\u2019s all about. It brought a refreshing humility to us all again, and it was a wonderful debut from the kid.\u201d\n\nNewcastle midfielder Matty Longstaff seems likely to keep his place at Chelsea (Owen Humphreys/PA)\n\nThe teenager\u2019s contract is due to expire at the end of the current season and with Manchester United having already expressed their interest in Sean, the Magpies are keen to tie up both brothers as soon as possible.\n\nBruce said: \u201cThe one thing we all don\u2019t want is to lose your best young players, so I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be all out to get that tied up \u2013 and his brother, which is vitally important.\u201d\n\nThe win over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s men raised the mood on Tyneside, but the club faces perhaps an even bigger test this weekend at Chelsea, who have won their last four games in all competitions with youngsters Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham also making an impact in the top flight under Frank Lampard.\n\nBruce, whose last game was his 400th as a Premier League manager, is delighted to see the former England midfielder making his mark after a tough start back at the club he served with such distinction as a player.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe\u2019s a great lad, Frank, and he was a great, great player, so that experience alone gives him that respect. He\u2019s adored by everybody there, so I think that will afford him a bit of time.\n\n\u201cThe big thing all of us tend to forget is to try, if you possibly can, to enjoy it. It\u2019s a really tough, tough job at times \u2013 you have many sleepless nights \u2013 and it\u2019s a lonely one too, but my bit of advice would be just to try to replicate what he did as a player, which was quietly get on with his job and let the rest do the talking.\u201d", "description": "The teenager marked his Premier League debut with the winner against Manchester United.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/wire-19879198-1571393672-641_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
