It's a phrase that has come to define their generations-long struggle, punctured by constant abandonment by foreign leaders.\n\n\u201cI am afraid there will be a process of ethnic cleansing, whether by the Turkish Army or the Free Syrian Army, or a process of demographic change and people from other regions coming in,\u201d a 32-year-old Kobane-based non-governmental organization (NGO) worker named Basheer told Fox News. \u201cBut, we expect a military liquidation against the Kurds, we expect (Turkey) to call all of us terrorists to destroy us.\u201d\n\nSaleh Jaaji, 39, lamented that he also was panicking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a plan, but I am thinking about running away, but I have nowhere to go,\u201d he said. \u201cEverywhere we go, there will be killing, displacing, looting. We made sacrifices for ISIS, and now this.\u201d\n\nSYRIAN OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS IRANIAN ACTIVITY INSIDE SYRIA HAS REACHED UNPRECEDENTED DANGEROUS LEVEL\n\nThe small U.S. contingent in the area of Syria once under the Islamic State's control was considered by many U.S. allies to be an effective use of Special Operations forces \u2013 enough to deter the Syrian regime, Russia, Iran, Turkey, and terrorist groups from purporting to dig too deep inside the historically Kurdish terrain, but ultimately at little human cost or sacrifice from the U.S.\n\nAccording to one U.S. soldier on the ground, America's role has been primarily to provide equipment and air support, with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) doing the heavy lifting.\n\n\u201cI am so worried about the U.S. decision. I have already been displaced. I refused to stay in Afrin (after Turkey and the Free Syrian Army) came in last year,\u201d Perry, a 33-year-old displaced person in Kobane, recalled. \u201cWe thought Kobane would be safe for us because of the United States protection, but we have been let down. We don\u2019t know where to go that will be safe now.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s stunning decision appeared to catch officials and many of his most prominent political loyalists off-guard. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called it a \u201cstain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds\u201d and a \u201cdisaster in the making.\u201d Former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee called Trump\u2019s decision a \u201chuge mistake\u201d cast against \u201cfaithful allies,\u201d and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., concurred that it was a \u201cgrave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria.\u201d\n\nNikki Haley, who served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the UN for almost two years, also condemned the move.\n\n\u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies if we expect them to have our back,\u201d she tweeted Monday. \u201cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake.\u201d\n\nSome officials and analysts also expressed concern that the U.S. stepping out of the Syrian fray would destabilize the blood-strewn region and give strength to an already brewing ISIS resurgence. The terrorist outfit was territorially defeated earlier this year but sustained cells throughout the area that have launched frequent attacks in civilian areas and sprawling refugee camps.\n\n\u201cI expect that there will be chaos in the region, east of the Euphrates in-particular,\u201d noted Bozy, a 39-year-old aid worker in Syria. \u201cWe will be ready if there is a civil war between all the components in the region, and the SDF will defend until the end.\u201d\n\nYAZIDI SEX SLAVE SURVIVOR TO FACE ONE OF HER ISIS RAPISTS IN GERMAN COURT\n\nA U.S. official told Fox News on Monday the U.S. military no longer will allow Turkish flights in Syria along the border with coalition aircraft and no longer will share intelligence from drone feeds in the region with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's forces.\n\nFollowing a phone call with Erdogan on Sunday, the White House suddenly released a statement announcing that \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria\u201d and that the U.S. would not be involved, and that the U.S. \u201cwill no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, some 100 to 150 troops were said to have started withdrawing from crucial posts in the northeastern dominion.\n\nFor decades, Ankara has been at war in the remote mountains with Kurdish separatists who have fought under the banner of the Kurdistan Workers Party, better known as the PKK. The group has been affiliated closely with the Kurdish fighters in Syria, many of whom dominated the ranks of the U.S.-supported SDF.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News late last month, Nasr Al-Hariri, the president of the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC) \u2013 which is closely allied to Turkey \u2013 also expressed concern over the SDF and its motivation.\n\n\u201cTurkey has legitimate concerns, as we have. Although the SDF fought ISIS, they are holding a separatist agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to divide the country, and the majority of the Syrian people are against this agenda. It is up to all Syrians to decide the political future of the country.\u201d\n\nWhile the alliance between the United States and Kurdish Syrians has long riled Ankara, the SDF took the lead on the ground against ISIS \u2013 effectively stamping out the terrorist scourge at the cost of thousands of their own lives.\n\n\u201cI am afraid of this decision to withdraw U.S. troops as they are the only force that can protect us,\u201d underscored Ali Nabo Ahmad, a 39-year-old medical manager in the Rojava region. \u201cWe are living here in peace \u2013 millions of Kurds, Arabs, Christians \u2013 and the U.S. withdrawal will allow Turkey to genocide us from the north, and the Assad regime will attack from the south, and it will give ISIS a chance to recover.\u201d\n\nOthers in the region expressed dismay that the U.S. had \u201ccheated\u201d them; still others blamed the SDF for trusting the United States in the first place and now leading innocent civilians to be caught in the crossfire. Some decried that as much as they \u201chate\u201d the Damascus regime, aligning with Assad might now be their best bet for survival.\n\nIt remains unclear how Turkey\u2019s long-threatened operation will unfold. In the wake of condemnation against his pullout announcement, Trump, on Monday, warned that he would \u201cobliterate and destroy\u201d the Turkish economy should Erdogan's forces aim at the Kurds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut, for Mazlom Daban, a former teacher and 33-year-old father of three, it remained a wincing blow to their faith in the red, white, and blue.\n\n\u201cMaybe there are no benefits economically for Mr. Trump to keep U.S. troops in the area,\u201d he added. \u201cBut, those hundred or so forces were protecting more than five million souls here.\u201d\n\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.", "description": "In the aftermath of President Trump\u2019s surprise announcement Sunday that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the predominantly Kurdish enclave in Northern Syria, some left languishing claimed \"ethnic cleansing\" could follow.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
