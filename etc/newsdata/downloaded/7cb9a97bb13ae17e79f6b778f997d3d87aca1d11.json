The authorities might not be able to listen in quite so easily but I suspect that they will have the means of doing it.\"\n\nThe protest movement in Hong Kong grew out of marches against a controversial bill to allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. That has since been suspended, but the marches have continued and morphed into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nProtesters have shown tech-savvy skills before, with pictures circulating on Twitter earlier this summer showing some defusing cartridges of tear gas with water bottles.", "description": "They want to communicate with each other while avoiding snooping from the Chinese authorities.", "authors": ["Jane Wakefield", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7876/production/_108283803_gettyimages-1154553368.jpg"}
