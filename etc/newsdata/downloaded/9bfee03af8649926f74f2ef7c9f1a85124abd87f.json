(Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential contender Joe Biden attacked President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies on Wednesday, telling voters in the electoral battleground state of Pennsylvania that the middle class is \u201cin trouble.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during the fourth U.S. Democratic presidential candidates 2020 election debate in Westerville, Ohio, U.S., October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump is capable of understanding that - he doesn\u2019t seem to have any sense of empathy at all,\u201d Biden said before an audience of more than 200 people in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the Rust Belt town where he grew up.\n\nBiden said Trump is squandering a strong economy left behind by former President Barack Obama, whom Biden served as vice president. Biden has focused his fire on the Republican president instead of the rivals in his own Democratic party.\n\n\u201cThe middle class built this country,\u201d Biden said, but \u201cthey\u2019re in trouble\u201d with many lacking healthcare or struggling to pay their bills.\n\nPennsylvania will be a key to the 2020 presidential election. Trump won the state in 2016 against Democrat Hillary Clinton by just 44,292 votes.\n\nTrump is due to speak later on Wednesday at an oil-and-gas industry event in Pittsburgh. A spokeswoman for his campaign, Erin Perrine, said in a statement that Biden is out of touch with the American middle class.\n\n\u201cUnder the Trump Administration workers are thriving, unemployment has hit record lows, wages are rising and all while taxes have been cut across the board - benefiting ALL Americans,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden turned his attention to the economy after spending much of the past several weeks attacking Trump for his decision to pull forces out of Syria and the president\u2019s allegations, offered without evidence, about the foreign business dealings of Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nTrump is running on a jobs-and-growth program, touting unemployment rates at multi-decade lows during the longest U.S. economic expansion on record. Yet many voters are angry over economic inequality and afraid of slowing growth and a potential recession as the benefits of a 2017 tax cut fade and tariffs on Chinese imports hurt American farmers and manufacturers.\n\nDemocratic candidates have unveiled a slew of economic proposals meant to invest in future generations and reverse wealth and income inequality. Biden has stopped short of supporting the most aggressive policies including universal income guarantees and imposing federal taxes on wealth, not just income.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honestly more conservative but I get good vibes from him,\u201d said Dan Amon, 18, a student at the University of Scranton who attended the speech and is considering voting in the Democratic primary for Biden. \u201cThe other Democratic candidates - they\u2019re a little too extreme to me.\u201d\n\nBiden has yet to release his own full economic plan. He has pledged to raise the U.S. minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current $7.25, and has released targeted spending proposals from higher education to healthcare.\n\nHe has criticized his opponents, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for lack of specifics about the wealth tax they support or how they would pay for proposals such as a Medicare for All plan based on the government health insurance program for Americans 65 and older.\n\nThe former vice president has promised to pay for his own plans largely by raising taxes on high-income earners. Biden would, for instance, hike the marginal tax rate on the highest earners back to 39.6% from 37%, to which it was lowered under the Republicans\u2019 2017 tax bill.", "description": "Democratic U.S. presidential contender Joe Biden attacked President Donald Trump's economic policies on Wednesday, telling voters in the electoral battleground state of Pennsylvania that the middle class is \"in trouble.\"", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444172426&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1K6", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
