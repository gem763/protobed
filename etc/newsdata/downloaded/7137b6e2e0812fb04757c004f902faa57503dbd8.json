The committee will meet on Monday to discuss his successor and the timing of his resignation, a source told Reuters, adding, \u201cSaikawa isn\u2019t at all clinging to his president\u2019s chair.\u201d\n\nGhosn, who had led Nissan for two decades before his arrest, is accused of underreporting his salary by tens of millions of dollars and transferring personal investment losses to Nissan.\n\nThe Frenchman, who also has Brazilian and Lebanese nationality, has denied any wrongdoing. He has accused Nissan executives of conspiring to have him arrested over unfounded fears about his plans for a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and alliance partner Renault.\n\nLawyers for Ghosn, who spent a total of 129 days in detention in Tokyo before being granted bail a second time in April, said last week that his trial was not expected to begin until March next year.\n\nJunichiro Hironaka, a member of Ghosn\u2019s defence team, said Nissan was guilty of double standards in its treatment of Ghosn and Saikawa.\n\n\u201cNissan must have known about the improper payment to Saikawa when it conducted its in-house probe into Ghosn,\u201d Kyodo quoted Hironaka as saying. \u201cIt turned a blind eye to Saikawa and only went after Ghosn.\u201d", "description": "Saikawa\u2019s fate to be discussed by board on Monday after admission that he was overpaid by hundreds of thousands of pounds", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39cf1afb29005034daddb259613d1ac17669f911/0_270_3330_1998/master/3330.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=38b334541367c93724d4fce7220898c3", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
