USA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The moments left the Los Angeles Clippers feeling inspired and amused.\n\nWhen Clippers coach Doc Rivers peered out his office window in June, he became pleasantly surprised seeing Lou Williams on the practice court. Usually, Williams spends that time vacationing in his Atlanta hometown. When Williams returned home, he produced work-out videos for his teammates to watch. During both instances, Williams left an unspoken albeit clear message to the coaching staff and players.\n\n\u201cI only got three or four years left. I want a real opportunity to win a championship,\u201d the 32-year-old Williams said. \u201cI need that energy to carry over to other guys that may have 10 to 12 more years to get an opportunity to win a championship.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers have a great opportunity to win one after acquiring Kawhi Leonard and Paul George this summer. The Clippers\u2019 fortunes, however, also rest on Williams. Without George because of off-season surgery on his left shoulder, Williams has helped the Clippers still have a dynamic duo. Whenever George returns, probably sometime within the next month, the Clippers expect Williams to help them morph from a team having a dynamic duo toward having a so-called \u201cBig Three.\u201d\n\nThrough the Clippers\u2019 first two regular-season games, Williams has averaged 21.5 points while shooting 52 percent from the field along with 7.5 assists, thanks to crafty playmaking, peak conditioning and unyielding hustle. Williams fulfilled this job description through 14 NBA seasons on both playoff contenders and rebuilding teams with the Philadelphia 76ers (2005-12), Atlanta Hawks (2012-14), Toronto Raptors (2014-15), Los Angeles Lakers (2015-17), Houston Rockets (2017) and Clippers (2017-present). Since his off-season workout, Williams has brought the same mentality knowing this might be his last chance to win a title.\n\n\u201cSome guys have to go on a journey first. Then all of a sudden, it is time for them,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cJust watching Lou\u2019s seriousness and how he has approached this year, you feel that. It\u2019s time. It\u2019s been great to see.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers saw those signs as early as this summer.\n\nOct. 22: Clippers guard Lou Williams (23) tries to pass around Lakers defender Dwight Howard (39).

To reduce any resentful feelings for returning to Atlanta, Williams recorded himself completing running drills in his own gym. Williams then sent those videos to the team\u2019s group text message chain called \u201cJust Clips.\u201d He asked his teammates to do the same.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sending a message to get ready,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good message. It\u2019s a visual message. It\u2019s funny. Sometimes you can do things in jest. I think he was doing it for fun so everyone could laugh. But I think he was doing it to tell everybody there is no way I can be the oldest guy and still be in better shape than you. That was the message.\u201d\n\nWilliams delivered more messages once training camp started.\n\nWilliams matched up with Leonard frequently during scrimmages, and he used that time to mark his territory. In portions open to the media, Williams often went one-on-one against Leonard and scored. Williams even stopped Leonard on a handful of possessions as well. After one scrimmage, George boasted to Williams that he could not do that to him once he returns. Williams guaranteed he would. As an amused Rivers observed, \u201cLou just talks and backs it up.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Williams does not seem consumed with climbing the Clippers\u2019 hierarchy or padding his statistics. That has happened naturally with how he plays. That has Rivers open-minded on occasionally starting Williams or keeping him as a reserve, a role that has garnered Williams the NBA\u2019s Sixth Man of the Year award three times (2005, 2018, 2019). Whenever Rivers has outlined the possibilities, Williams defers without complaining.\n\n\u201cWhatever is required for the team, I think it\u2019s important for us to buy in and do it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI don\u2019t really care. But can we put that to bed that I asked to come off the bench? It\u2019s just that nobody has asked me to start. I hate when people say, \u2018You ask to come off the bench so you can win awards.\u2019 No I don\u2019t. That\u2019s a ridiculous idea. But I do whatever is required for the team.\u201d\n\nWhat is required for Williams? Nothing other than sharing ball-handling duties with Leonard, running countless pick-and-rolls with Montrezl Harrell and scoring by converting frequently at the free-throw line, at the basket and behind the perimeter. Williams appears ready.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many cracks I\u2019m going to have at winning a championship,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI feel like we really have a good group. I don\u2019t want that opportunity to go to waste because our mentality is not sharp. I\u2019m just doing my part to make sure everybody is on the same page and the competitive level is there. We don\u2019t take days off and we compete.\u201d\n\nFollow USA Today NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "Three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams uses offseason workouts to inspire teammates, and he is ready for a Clippers championship.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published A.M.
