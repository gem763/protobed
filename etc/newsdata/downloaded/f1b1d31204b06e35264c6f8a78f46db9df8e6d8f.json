A survey published last week by Indonesia's biggest newspaper Kompas showed his approval rating dipping only slightly to 58.8%.\n\nIn April's election, Widodo defeated former general Prabowo Subianto by a double-digit margin, but the poll revealed a split with more moderate Muslims and minorities backing Widodo and conservative Muslim regions backing his rival.\n\nViolent rioting broke out in Jakarta when Prabowo contested the poll results over claims of cheating, but the Constitutional Court upheld Widodo's victory and there have since been talks to bring some opposition figures into the government.\n\nThe make-up of Widodo's cabinet is being closely watched to see the proportion of technocrats versus party affiliated posts and there has been speculation that Prabowo or other members of the opposition could join the cabinet. There are expected to be 34 ministers in the cabinet and Widodo said around 16 would come from political parties.\n\nThe president's $33 billion plan to relocate Indonesia's capital from sinking, congested Jakarta on Java island to the island of Borneo has grabbed headlines. But it has also raised questions about how it would be financed and its environmental impact.\n\nIndonesia's economic growth is forecast to slow for the first time in four years in 2019 and some independent observers warn of a further slowdown amid a global downturn.\n\n(Additional reporting by Stanley Widianto, Gayatri Suroyo, Fransiska Nangoy and Ed Davies Editing by David Holmes and Frances Kerry)", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo was sworn in on Sunday for a second five-year term leading the world's third-biggest democracy, after an election dominated by economic issues but also the growing influence of conservative Islam.
