Some of them were even forces for good.\n\nI\u2019m thinking in particular of Andrew Tyrie, who was a fine chair of the Treasury Select Committee and went on to bounce the government into enacting some highly important reforms to the banking industry as chair of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards.\n\nWhen it comes to MPs, I have always taken care to bear in mind a lecture given by The Observer\u2019s former political editor Adam Raphael while I was on City University\u2019s postgraduate journalism course.\n\nHe didn\u2019t hold with the public\u2019s low opinion of parliamentarians, opining that most were good people who genuinely cared about their constituents and wanted to do their best for them regardless of their political creed.\n\nNow? I\u2019m not so sure. Watching the baying mob waving order papers behind Boris Johnson, a narcissist for whom the truth is an alien concept, has changed my mind.\n\nThey know he\u2019s bad, at least most of them do. Yet still, they line up behind him, parrot his lies and give him their votes.\n\nDo they care about their constituents? The government\u2019s own reports say supplies of insulin, epilepsy drugs, cancer treatments, and more besides, will be threatened by a no-deal Brexit. It will literally threaten the lives of people like me who require those drugs.\n\nYet when presented with the opportunity to say no to that outcome, most of them repeatedly ducked it.\n\nThe best of them, the ones with principles, have had the whip withdrawn. Some are quitting parliament, some are pursuing their careers with other parties like the Liberal Democrats.\n\nWatching the performance of those that remain? Now \u201cTory\u201d really is, for me, a swearword.\n\nYours,\n\nJames Moore\n\nChief business commentator", "description": "I\u2019ve never lined up alongside those on the left who like to snarl about \u201cthe Tories\u201d in the same way rappers cry a certain compound word containing an \u201cm\u201d\u00a0and an\u00a0\u201cf\u201d.
