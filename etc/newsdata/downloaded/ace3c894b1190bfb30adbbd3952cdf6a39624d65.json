Erik Lamela added a fourth before Kane completed the rout in the 72nd minute.\n\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said the win was a welcome confidence boost for the club, which has struggled to replicate its stellar form of last season that saw the London club go all the way to the Champions League final.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russians stop Ronaldo: Dybala saves Juventus in 2-1 win after Lokomotiv Moscow take lead in Turin\n\n\"I don't feel great, I feel okay,\" he said.\n\n\"It's only one game, three points, but of course we need to build our confidence and we have to start at some point.\n\n\"So it's great for the confidence and tomorrow a day off because we scored five goals.\n\n\"In the next few games we will go on showing that the problems are on the pitch, not outside of the pitch.\"\n\nCaptain Kane also hailed the performance, which comes at an ideal time with the side set to face early pacesetters Liverpool at the weekend.\n\n\"We know we have had a tough run of results and that was the perfect way to respond,\" he said.", "description": "Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min bagged a brace apiece as Tottenham Hotspur hammered Red Star Belgrade 5-0 in a match that saw the away side's fans flout a UEFA ban to get inside the stadium to watch the match.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5daf886285f54026b96dd870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
