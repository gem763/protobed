It\u2019s hard to say what the two former USC students are doing now with all their free time. Olivia Jade, the reigning social media empress of the duo, has largely fallen quiet across her formerly thriving social media platforms since the scandal broke seven months ago. She last posted on Instagram back in July in honor of Loughlin\u2019s birthday, and that was just a throwback pic of an infant Olivia Jade and her mom in simpler, less scandalous times.\n\nIn case you need a refresher, Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, have been accused of paying $500,000 to get their two daughters, falsely posing as crew team recruits, accepted into USC. The debacle is part of the massive college admissions scam that broke out back in March, in which more than 30 parents have been charged with conspiracy fraud.\n\nAlso among the high profile parents caught up in the scandal is actress Felicity Huffman, who pled guilty and was sentenced to 14 days in prison last month. Huffman began her sentence on October 15.\n\nLoughlin and her husband, meanwhile, decided to fight the charge and are now facing an additional charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering. They\u2019ve pled not guilty to both charges, which, as it turns out, probably wasn\u2019t the best idea.\n\nMeanwhile, four non-famous parents who initially fought the charges have since pleaded guilty, CNN reported. Douglas Hodge, Manuel Henriquez, Elizabeth Henriquez and Michelle Janavs each pleaded guilty on Monday. This change of heart comes as federal prosecutors are reportedly expected to file additional charges against some defendants who pleaded not guilty.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story", "description": "Lori Loughlin's daughters are no longer enrolled at the University of Southern California as the fallout from the college admission's scandal continues.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Olivia_Jade.jpg?fit=1161%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
