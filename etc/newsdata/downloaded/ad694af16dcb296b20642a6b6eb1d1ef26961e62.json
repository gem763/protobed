Wagner Cultivation Corporation Reports Inaugural Harvest at G2 Pod and Record Harvest in September", "language": "en", "text": "KITCHENER, Ontario, Oct. 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- James E. Wagner Cultivation Corporation (\u201cJWC\u201d or the \u201cCorporation\u201d) (TSX VENTURE: JWCA; OTCQX: JWCAF), is pleased to announce that is has completed its inaugural harvest in flowering room G2 of its flagship facility located at 530 Manitou Drive in Kitchener, Ontario (\u201cJWC2\u201d). Flowering room G2 is one of two rooms in what JWC has designated as \u201cG Pod\u201d, each of which rooms consists of approximately 5,500 square feet of flowering space. The Corporation had previously received a licence amendment from Health Canada on July 2, 2019, allowing it to cultivate cannabis in these rooms.\n\n\n\nIn the last week of the Corporation\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter ending September 30, 2019, cannabis was harvested from the approximately 5,500 square feet of space in flowering room G2. The room was promptly refilled within three days of the harvest, with cannabis plants ready to commence flowering. The room is now operating on a regular production schedule and is capable of producing six or more crop cycles per year, depending on the combination of strains being harvested from that room. Over the course of September, JWC harvested approximately 13,500 square feet of flowering space. It is anticipated that the harvests that occurred during September will collectively yield in excess of 300 kg of cannabis, being the most ever harvested by JWC in a calendar month.\n\n\u201cSeptember\u2019s harvest was a tremendous achievement by our grow teams which have done an amazing job bringing G2 up to full production over a short period of time\u2026\u201d commented JWC president and CEO, Nathan Woodworth. \u201cGiven our growing reputation for producing clean and consistent cannabis, demand for our superior products continues to exceed our production capacity despite the record harvests. This demand has set the stage for rapid revenue growth and profitability over the coming quarters, including a record finish to fiscal 2019.\u201d\n\nAbout James E.
