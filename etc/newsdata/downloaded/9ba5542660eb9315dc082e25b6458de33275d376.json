There were a few members of the media present at the event and they decided that the most interesting part of Cooperman\u2019s talk was his comments regarding the private equity industry. \u201cI think it\u2019s a scam personally\u201d Cooperman said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest factor in the success of the private equity in the last decade is the enormous decline in interest rates. That made the exit multiple much higher than the entry multiple. Anybody betting on lower interest rates from here is betting on depression. The odds are very high the interest rates will be going up over the next 5 to 10 years\u201d Cooperman added.\n\nObviously I didn\u2019t attend this event to report on Cooperman\u2019s private equity comments. I am interested in Cooperman\u2019s market view as well as his best investment ideas. He has been consistently betting on a bull market over the last 10 years and I don\u2019t think he predicted a recession or a bear market at any point over the last 10 years. So, Cooperman is a very reliable recession indicator in my opinion.\n\nLeon Cooperman Omega Advisors More\n\nCooperman estimates that S&P 500 constituents will earn $168 this year and he puts a 17 multiple on that to reach 2890 for the S&P 500 Index. \u201cI think the market is fairly valued. Not overvalued, not undervalued,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t think it is appropriate to use a higher multiple because of the ultra-low interest rate environment. He said he was very surprised how abruptly the economy slowed down during the fourth quarter of 2018 \u201cin the face of very small interest rate increase\u201d. This tells him that there is a corporate debt problem and it is getting worse, not better. \u201cWe have record high margins and margins tend to mean revert,\u201d Cooperman added.\n\nCooperman didn\u2019t elaborate on this but it is clearly not a good idea to invest in highly leveraged companies or long-term bond ETFs like iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) going forward.\n\nIn the current environment Cooperman doesn\u2019t see any alternatives to stocks. He dropped the name of his favorite cheap stock during the talk. He said this stock is trading at only 2 times its 2022 earnings. I will do an in-depth analysis of this stock in the coming issue of our monthly newsletter to see under what assumptions Cooperman sees this stock trading at 2 times earnings. If that\u2019s indeed the case, it can easily be an easy triple from today\u2019s price. Right now we have a promotion going on. You can subscribe to both of our newsletters for only $349/year, a discount of $200. This is the lowest price of the year.\n\nThe second stock Cooperman talked about was Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI). \u201cI had breakfast yesterday with the CEO of Cigna. The stock is 8 times earnings, buying back 2-3% annually and growing earnings\u201d he said about Cigna. Cigna was the fifth largest position in Omega Advisors\u2019 13F portfolio at the end of June.\n\nThe third stock Cooperman raved about was United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), saying that United Airlines retired 14% of its stock during the last 4 years, earning $12 and trading at only 7 times earnings. United Airlines was the third largest position in Omega\u2019s 13F portfolio.\n\nAfter the event concluded one of the guests asked him about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) because it is under regulatory scrutiny. Cooperman told him that it is great buying opportunity. Cooperman told him that the government tried to break up Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) 20 years ago and the stock declined 20% initially but that proved to be a great buying opportunity as the stock went on to return 900% since then. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the second largest position in Omega\u2019s 13F portfolio. Alphabet is also extremely popular among hedge funds, being one of the 5 most popular stocks (see the 30 most popular hedge fund stocks).", "description": "I listened to Leon Cooperman\u2019s talk at an event hosted by the New York Alternative Investment Roundtable.
