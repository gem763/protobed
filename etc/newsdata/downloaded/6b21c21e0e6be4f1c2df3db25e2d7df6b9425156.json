Eskom acting CEO Jabu Mabuza said.\n\nHe said Eskom has information that showed Eskom officials gave Deloitte off-the record briefings on proposals and that Deloitte was granted contracts even though their pricing was way above their competitors. These contracts were modified to just under the ceiling price which requires the approval of the provincial Treasury.\n\n\u201cDeloitte was granted contacts when their prices were five times higher than those of their competitors,\u201d Mabuza said.\n\nIn one of the tenders, Deloitte's price was R79 million versus just under R16 million and R9 million from two competitors. In a second tender Deloitte's price was R88.8m versus R14.5m, R13.25m and R6.59m from three competitors.\n\n\"This shows pure corruption on the part of Deloitte and the Eskom executives who facilitated these contracts with absolutely no regard for Eskoms sustainability,\u201d Mabuza said.\n\nThe affidavit further calls for the former chief financial officer, Anoj Singh and senior executive Prish Govender to pay the costs of the application. Both Singh, a former Deloitte employee, and Govender have resigned. At the Eskom inquiry last year, public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan told Singh that he brought Eskom \u201cto its knees\u201d.\n\nFin24 has contacted a Deloitte spokesperson for comment, and is still awaiting a response.", "description": "Eskom wants Deloitte to pay back more than R207m for two tenders and other work the audit firm secured \u201cimproperly\u201d during 2016.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3674/b5f93cefd55f4f9aba15e33371aa8423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
