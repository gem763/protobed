McConnell noted that ISIS and Al Qaeda remained resilient terrorist organizations, and he urged the continuation of counterterrorism efforts in the region.\n\nThe news of Baghdadi\u2019s death also drew some attention away from the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, after a week that included damning testimony about the president\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.\n\nThe death of Baghdadi, who detonated a suicide vest after he was cornered in a tunnel, comes as Congress has struggled to coalesce around a strategy for responding to Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops from Syria. That move led to a Turkish incursion in the country and the emergence of Russian forces in an area once controlled by U.S.-allied Kurds.\n\nPeople look at destroyed houses near the village of Barisha, in Idlib province, Syria, on Sunday after an operation by the U.S. military which targeted Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. | Ghaith Alsayed/AP Photo\n\nGraham, who warned that Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops could be the greatest mistake of his presidency, has introduced a sanctions package against Turkey with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). The South Carolina Republican said last week that he would continue to push for co-sponsors, but added that recent events allowed for \u201cbreathing space.\u201d The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), and the panel\u2019s ranking member, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), also have their own sanctions proposal. But McConnell has also urged caution against sanctioning a NATO ally.\n\n\u201cI commend President Trump on his leadership and resolve in the fight against terror,\u201d Risch said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cBaghdadi\u2019s removal from the battlefield represents another significant milestone in the fight against ISIS. We must continue to apply pressure until the Islamic State is incapable of reconstituting.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have called on Senate Republicans to pass a House resolution condemning Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, a measure that received significant support from House Republicans. McConnell has argued that his resolution is stronger.\n\nA group of Republican senators took a more positive tone on Thursday about the administration\u2019s Syria policy, following a lunch at the White House with the president.\n\n\u201cWe were actually pretty encouraged by what progress would be made in Syria and what the game plan is,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), after meeting with Trump.\n\nWhile Baghdadi\u2019s death received bipartisan praise, Democrats renewed their criticism of the troop withdrawal. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also slammed the administration for neglecting to inform congressional leaders about the raid.\n\n\u201cThe death of al-Baghdadi is significant, but the death of this ISIS leader does not mean the death of ISIS,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) further warned that \u201cthere are still potentially hundreds of ISIS prisoners and sympathizers who have escaped in recent weeks\u201d and that \u201cwe still need a plan for how we will deal with the escaped prisoners and ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe news of Baghdadi\u2019s death gave additional ammunition to Trump\u2019s defenders against the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, after explosive testimony last week from the administration\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor, and the appearance of a string of officials who defied a White House directive not to cooperate with the investigation. While this week\u2019s Sunday news shows were expected to focus on impeachment, Baghdadi\u2019s death instead dominated.\n\nRep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, criticized the panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), for focusing on impeachment instead of Syria. He said he couldn\u2019t recall the last time the committee had a briefing on Syria, but added that the panel would receive one on Monday.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Intelligence Committee that I serve on hasn\u2019t been spending a whole lot of time on these issues. We\u2019ve been caught up in Adam Schiff\u2019s secret impeachment inquiry,\u201d Ratcliffe said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cAll I can remember is one ambassador after another that I\u2019ve never heard of before.\u201d\n\nRep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, said on the same program that Baghdadi\u2019s death demonstrated that Trump \u201ckept his eye on the ball\u201d despite being \u201cattacked and harassed by the House impeachment probe.\u201d He further criticized Democrats for not offering sufficient praise of the Trump administration for Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cTo see the silence from them, maybe they are upset that maybe their impeachment headlines are knocked off the front page for a morning,\u201d Collins said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/58/95/836409804ffbbd8a983ad8e13116/20191027-lindsey-graham-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
