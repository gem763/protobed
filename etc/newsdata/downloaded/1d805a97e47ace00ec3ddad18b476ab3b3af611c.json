Now she is swapping Kensal Rise for a swanky apartment in New York with her director boyfriend Martin McDonagh.\n\nWord reaches me that the star \u2013 pictured at last month\u2019s Emmys where she picked up four awards \u2013 wants to immerse herself in the Big Apple while working on a new project.\n\nSince she\u2019s just signed a writing deal with Amazon Prime that\u2019s said to be worth \u00a350 million, she can probably afford quite a nice flat...prpapbexecs who have signed her to a \u00a350 million TV deal.dd share with her director boyfriend Martin McDonagh... and her four Emmy awards.\n\nWord reaches me that the star \u2013 pictured at last month\u2019s Emmys where she picked up four awards \u2013 wants to immerse herself in the Big Apple while working on a new project\n\nShe is swapping Kensal Rise for a swanky apartment in New York with her director boyfriend Martin McDonagh (pictured together at the Emmy Awards last month)\n\nThe rumour on Broadway - where her one woman show Fleabag was a hit earlier this year - is that she wants to immerse herself in the Big Apple while she writes an original new screenplay.\n\nOf course she also has plenty of meetings lined up with Seattle-based Amazon Prime Video - the TV network which just offered her a \u00a350m TV writing contract.\n\nJust a couple of years ago Phoebe, 34, was living in Kensal Rise, sharing a Victorian townhouse with her then-husband Conor Woodman. How times have changed!\n\nThe Duchess of York is making another Royal film \u2013 this time about the woman described as the \u2018Diana of her age\u2019.\n\nThe chequered life of Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg \u2013 the mother of Prince Albert \u2013 has gripped Fergie: she married twice, had affairs and died aged 30. But like Diana with her sons William and Harry, Louise inspired Albert to devote much of his time to charity work.\n\nThe Duchess of York is making another Royal film \u2013 this time about the woman described as the \u2018Diana of her age\u2019 (Diana is pictured left in 1987). The chequered life of Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (right) \u2013 the mother of Prince Albert \u2013 has gripped Fergie: she married twice, had affairs and died aged 30\n\nThe Duchess attended Heather Kerzner\u2019s Discover Film party last week and I hear she told guests she\u2019d secured funding for the film, My Louise, by talking up the success of her 2009 movie The Young Victoria. Now she just needs a writer.\n\nSadly, her good pal Daisy Goodwin is out of the running: success writing ITV\u2019s Victoria has made Daisy the Duchess\u2019s rival.\n\nSimon Cowell has done the most vulgar thing imaginable for a celeb worth almost half a billion pounds \u2013 he\u2019s taken out a mortgage. The loan, which he\u2019s been told is a good idea because interest rates are so low, has been secured against his \u00a310 million house in Holland Park, West London, after he decided not to sell it.\n\nPerhaps a reason the TV mogul, 60, would enjoy some extra cash is because he is about to embark on work on his other London house \u2013 a vast mansion in Wimbledon. But I\u2019m not holding my breath: Simon, who is worth \u00a3437 million, started renovating his home in Beverly Hills ten years ago \u2013 and the builders still haven\u2019t finished!\n\n\u2018Longest legs in Belgravia\u2019 takes fame in her stride\n\nSocialite Amanda Cronin is ready to take a big step towards becoming a social media superstar \u2013 helped in no small way by famously having \u2018the longest legs in Belgravia\u2019. Amanda tells me she has 37 in legs (from hip to ankle) and jokes: \u2018I\u2019m three-quarters leg and one-quarter torso.\u2019\n\nHer quest to become an influencer is not exactly hampered by fact that she is already a stalwart on London\u2019s social scene, is worth tens of millions and has a stunning Belgravia home following her divorce from energy firm tycoon Mark Daeche.\n\nSocialite Amanda Cronin (pictured) is ready to take a big step towards becoming a social media superstar \u2013 helped in no small way by famously having \u2018the longest legs in Belgravia\u2019\n\nAmanda says she is now free to find fame as her former husband preferred her to stay under the radar. Amanda, 45, who is now dating a man she refers to mysteriously as \u2018The Canadian\u2019, adds: \u2018The difference between me and other influencers is that I own my own clothes and jewellery. I own my life. Everything I have, I own it.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m not jealous\u2026 honest!\n\nShe's taking an Elle of a risk with that dress...\n\nWell, a girl\u2019s got to eat \u2013 even if it means scoffing a bowl of noodles while modelling an Armani gown worth thousands of pounds.\n\nHollywood actress Elle Fanning, who is currently starring in Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil, shared this shot of herself grabbing lunch while shooting a magazine fashion campaign last week. The 21-year-old told her three million Instagram followers: \u2018The only way to eat ramen is in armani couture.\u2019 Shouldn\u2019t that be \u2018rameni couture\u2019, Elle?\n\nHollywood actress Elle Fanning, who is currently starring in Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil, shared this shot of herself grabbing lunch while shooting a magazine fashion campaign last week\n\nThere was no shortage of celebrity virtue-signalling last week during the Extinction Rebellion protests in London. Otis Ferry swapped his girlfriend\u2019s pad, Belvoir Castle, for a night on the streets of Westminster. Naturally, he revealed all on social media to get maximum ego-boosting \u2018likes\u2019 from his luvvie pals.\n\nMy spies saw Daisy Lowe snogging her boyfriend Jack Penate as they lay on the ground relaxing as if they were at a festival. Alas, they spoiled their street cred by taking in a concert at the Royal Albert Hall after a hard day of \u2018protesting\u2019. Actress Jaime Winstone told me she would be gluing her hands to the pavement but seemingly never followed through with it. And Lady Mary Charteris urged us to ditch toothpaste for baking soda.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t manage to get a ticket to next year\u2019s Glastonbury, take a tip from model Lottie Moss: \u2018It\u2019s easier to get into Glastonbury by learning an instrument, forming a band, going on tour, getting signed, releasing a few albums, making millions and getting invited to headline the Pyramid Stage rather than just buying tickets on that website.\u2019\n\nPoor Lottie was one of thousands of people who missed out last week \u2013 all 135,000 tickets sold out online in just 35 minutes.\n\nBut I\u2019m not too worried for Lottie because she can always have a word about getting a free pass with the star dubbed \u2018the original Queen of Glastonbury\u2019\u2026 her big sister Kate.\n\nPoor Lottie, pictured at Glasto in June this year, was one of thousands of people who missed out last week \u2013 all 135,000 tickets sold out online in just 35 minutes.\n\nWith the country gripped by warring WAGs Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy, Alastair Campbell couldn\u2019t resist being patronising about Coleen\u2019s grammar.\n\nAfter reading Coleen\u2019s tweet accusing Rebekah of selling stories about her to a newspaper, the former Labour spin doctor, 62, commented: \u2018I was impressed by her use of apostrophes, they were all in the right places. It was very well written.\u2019\n\nPoor Alastair: it must be hard to accept that Coleen is not only more famous and richer than him but she\u2019s just as good at writing, too.", "description": "TALK OF THE TOWN: The rumour on Broadway - where her one woman show Fleabag was a hit  - is that she wants to immerse herself in the Big Apple while she writes an original new screenplay.", "authors": ["Charlotte Griffiths For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/22/19634830-0-image-a-86_1570917058353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
