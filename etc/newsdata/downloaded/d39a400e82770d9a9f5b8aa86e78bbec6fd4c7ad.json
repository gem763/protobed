I feel like a movie is always about a problem, so something has to be wrong \u2014 something has to be hard to get.\n\nThen that also transfers to my personal life.\n\nIt's true that I've always been attracted to people who are not necessarily interested in me \u2014 even if they were queer, they were in a relationship, or lived abroad.\n\nMaybe I'm the one who's not comfortable with ambiguity, because I've been living with ambiguity my entire life. Not my own ambiguity, but I've been with heterosexual men my entire 20s.\n\nThey were ambiguous. And they were trying to be gay, but not necessarily able to.\n\nIs having your work labelled 'queer' limiting?\n\nI don't really care. I'm queer. As a kid, I never saw queer people [in film], never.\n\nAnd then eventually, when I got older, there were movies where suddenly I could see male contact, and male sex. But these were also very bleak stories about suicide, about bullying.\n\nThey were always tragic stories. I could never really see myself represented.\n\nSo maybe for a part of my life, I struggled with my life and works being categorized as \"queer.\" But I certainly don't anymore.\n\nI am queer. And if I tell a love story about two men, I'm just telling a love story. I've seen love stories about men and women my entire life and I've never categorized them as \"straight movies.\"\n\nI might make movies about homosexual people for the rest of my life. They'll still be stories, and movies, and that's just that's just the way it is.\n\nDolan poses for photographers upon arrival at the awards ceremony for the 69th Cannes film festival in 2016. (Joel Ryan/Associated Press)\n\nBeing happy in wanting\n\nI'm looking for romance.\n\nI'm not looking for stability, and relationships, and settling down.\n\nI'm looking for mad passionate love where we'll chase each other, and then it won't work, and I will be stranded in an airport listening to Everything by Lifehouse.\n\nThere's nothing greater than writing movies when you are heartbroken, or when you are striving to impress someone that you wish loved you.\n\nConflict, feeling, film\n\nThings are not always easy and soft. You don't always ask permission before you hit someone, before you scream at someone, or before you feel betrayed.\n\nFeelings are feelings. I make movies out of feelings \u2014 things that I felt.\n\nThe most important thing about these films is not the acting, not the sets, not the light, and not the names of the actors on the sheet.\n\nThey're not me and my little stupid ideas of how we can frame something, or play with film. The most important thing for me is feeling.\n\nIn a special episode of Chosen Family \u2014 part retrospective, part love letter \u2014 Thomas shares personal stories about award-winning Montreal filmmaker Xavier Dolan from throughout the years. Then, the Cannes darling himself opens up in a rare feature interview about love, family and friendship. 41:05\n\nHow has fame changed you?\n\nIt has certainly brought me closer to the people that I really love, and the people who really love me, and who have helped me shape who I am.\n\nPeople who have helped me get rid of the bullsh-t \u2014 of the superfluous friendships or the superfluous traits of my own character \u2014 moments in my life where I thought it was cool to hate everything and hate on everything.\n\nI've gotten rid of that.\n\nDolan work includes directing eight films and he's also an actor (seen here in Matthias & Maxime). (eOne)\n\nConfidence in the work, not the self\n\nI've been told \"No\" so many times. When I was handing out my first script people would say, \"This is not good. You have to go back to school. This is sh-t.\"\n\nSo there were hardships along the way \u2014 which is good, and which is normal, I guess.\n\nBut I knew what I wanted to do. And I knew I wanted to be an actor and director.\n\nAnd anyone standing in my way was the hurdle that I needed to circumvent and go around because, I had to survive and just do my thing.\n\nI have confidence, perhaps not in myself, but in my ideas and in what I want to do.", "description": "Dolan, 30, spoke with Montreal comedians Thomas Leblanc and Tranna Wintour for a special episode of their CBC podcast, Chosen Family.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323676.1571263368!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/matthias-maxime-dolan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
