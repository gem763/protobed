But he\u2019s refused to bow to criticism from Capitol Hill lawmakers who say he betrayed Kurdish allies and ceded way to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to go home,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf Turkey goes into Syria, that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria.\u201d\n\nSyrian fighters are stepping in to bolster the Kurds.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight. They\u2019re not angels, they\u2019re not angels, but they fought with us,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nHe suggested the Kurds \u201cdidn\u2019t do so well\u201d when they didn\u2019t fight with the U.S.\n\nMr. Trump frequently returned to his main message \u2014 that American soldiers shouldn\u2019t serve as a police force for the region.\n\nMr. Trump would like to do what he can to keep the Middle East \u201cstable,\u201d to the extent that\u2019s possible.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in a very good position in the Middle East,\u201d he said, citing economic pressure on Iran.\n\nHe defended his decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia even as he withdraws troops from Syria, saying they\u2019ve been a good ally and is paying for \u201c100%\u201d of the cost.\n\nCritics of the president\u2019s approach toward the situation in Syria fear Mr. Trump\u2019s actions will have long-lasting effects.\n\n\u201cI hope President Trump is right in his belief that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria is of no concern to us, abandoning the Kurds won\u2019t come back to haunt us, ISIS won\u2019t reemerge, and Iran will not fill the vacuum created by this decision,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said on Twitter.\n\n\u2022 Ben Wolfgang contributed to this article.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
