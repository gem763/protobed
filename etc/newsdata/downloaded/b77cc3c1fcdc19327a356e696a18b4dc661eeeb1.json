Many are fleeing corruption and drug-related violence, including the botched arrest of former drug lord Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, the officials say, is especially concerned since the immigration courts already are struggling to hear a backlog of million migrants requesting relief from removal proceedings.\n\nNeither Mexico or the US government has acknowledged the surge at the border, or the possible trouble that may be looming over an agreement between President Donald Trump and Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador that previously cut down on the number of illegal crossings.\n\nData shows the total number of Mexican adults crossing the border spiked by 25 per cent from late July to late September. Migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, at the same time, declined, reports the Post.\n\nOfficials say that the of Mexican families who were detained at the border also has surged.\n\nMany of those fleeing blamed violence related to last week's botched arrest of Guzman's son, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, 28, (pictured)\n\nThe bloody, war-like confrontation in Culiac\u00e1n that resulted when authorities attempted to arrest the former El Chapo's son, Ogivido Guzman Lopez, ended with his release after the drug lord's cartel struck back at the Mexican army, leaving at least 8 dead\n\nMany of those fleeing blamed violence related to last week's botched arrest of Guzman's son, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, 28.\n\nThe bloody, war-like confrontation in Culiac\u00e1n ended with his release after the drug lord's cartel struck back at the Mexican army, leaving at least 8 dead.\n\nHowever, there also was a bizarre rumor that the US was welcoming Asylum seekers, reports the Post.\n\nBut there also are indications some are heading to the border with their children after hearing that the United States was opening its doors to Mexican asylum seekers.\n\nLocal officials in the Cuidad Hidalgo said hundreds of local residents in the town of 55,000 have suddenly left on a rumor that the US had recently opened a new opportunity for them to come to the border and request asylum.\n\nThere's even a weekly bus that takes residents directly to Tijuana and other border towns, offering asylum seekers a 'door-to-door package,' said Eduardo Cort\u00e9s, the city manager, reports the Post.\n\n'It's a phenomenon that took us all by surprise here,' Cort\u00e9s said. 'It's like the rumor hit the streets and now people think there's a chance for them to improve their lives by moving to the United States.'", "description": "The total number of Mexican adults crossing the border spiked by 25 per cent from late July to late September, while migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador declined.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
