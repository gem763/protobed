(AP) - The University of Wisconsin says it has received just $700,000 of the $100 million that Foxconn Technology Group pledged to fund engineering and innovation research on the school\u2019s flagship campus.\n\nProgress has been slow since the world\u2019s leading electronics manufacturer made the promise in August 2018, according to a Wisconsin State Journal report Tuesday.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison spokesman John Lucas said there has been \u201cno significant progress in discussions\u201d on the investment that was touted at the time as the largest research partnership in the university\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cUW-Madison is hopeful that discussions will move forward in the coming months,\u201d Lucas said in a statement.\n\nDespite public statements referencing a $100 million donation to the school over five years, the official partnership agreement between UW-Madison and Foxconn does not mention a specific dollar figure or when the company will provide the funds. It says Foxconn \u201cintends to make a substantial investment in research and other activities\u201d with the school.\n\nTaiwan-based Foxconn declined to confirm how much money it has invested in UW-Madison, but said in a statement that it remains committed to engineering and research at UW-Madison.\n\nFoxconn will continue to \u201cdevelop the demonstration projects and the strategic plans to collaboratively formulate the interdisciplinary research and education\u201d for students and faculty, it said.\n\nThe university and company have partnered on projects with some success, including an internship program and the \u201cSmart Cities-Smart Futures\u201d manufacturing competition, which brought in 325 submissions from students, faculty and staff. The $700,000 was used for a sponsored engineering research project, Lucas said.\n\nThe Foxconn pledge requires UW-Madison to fundraise to match its donation. Lucas said the school has yet to launch such a campaign.\n\nFoxconn plans to build a high-tech screen manufacturing plant in southeastern Wisconsin in a nearly $3 billion contract with the state. President Donald Trump has touted the project as a sign that manufacturing is returning to the United States.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Wisconsin State Journal, http://www.madison.com/wsj\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The University of Wisconsin says it has received just $700,000 of the $100 million that Foxconn Technology Group pledged to fund engineering and innovation research on the school's flagship campus.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
