In the second paragraph, the anonymous whistleblower says: \u201cThe president\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort.\u201d\n\nThe author goes on to refer to Giuliani 31 times, painting a picture of a lawyer who in the service of his old friend and now personal client, Trump, set himself up as a virtual state within a state. Giuliani is accused of circumventing national security protocols as he scurried between Washington and Kyiv carrying private orders from the president, many of dubious legality.\n\nThat the man who was hailed as a national hero, \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d, in the wake of 9/11 should now find himself accused of undermining national security amid a billowing impeachment scandal is extraordinary in itself. Even more astonishing is that so many of the details of the Ukraine connection have been put into the public domain by Giuliani himself.\n\nHe has been so willing to speak openly on cable TV and social media about his dealings with top Ukrainian officials seeking dirt on the leading Democratic presidential candidate, former vice-president Joe Biden, that he has deepened Trump\u2019s legal peril almost on a daily basis.\n\nQ&A What is the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower scandal? Show Hide On 25 July, US president Donald Trump called Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. During the course of the call he reportedly asked the Ukrainian leader eight times to investigate former US vice-president Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. It is additionally reported that Trump ordered his staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine days before the call took place. Biden is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination and take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Trump confirmed he discussed the Bidens with Zelenskiy, and accused the pair \u2013 without offering any evidence \u2013 of corruption. A US intelligence community whistleblower filed a report after becoming alarmed at Trump\u2019s behaviour in the matter. The White House refused to release the substance of the whistleblower complaint, setting up a confrontation with Congress over the release of information. Complaints of this nature are usually reported to Congress within seven days. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, has admitted asking the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens. It is illegal for a political campaign to accept a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. Democrats say an investigation into a political opponent \u2013 for which Trump appears to have been pushing \u2013 would amount to a thing of value.\n\nOn Thursday, Giuliani posted a tweet that extended the crisis from the White House to the state department. In the tweet, he reproduced a July text message from Kurt Volker, then US special representative to Ukraine, introducing Giuliani to a key adviser of the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe chilling undertone of the tweet was unmistakable: if I\u2019m going down, you\u2019re going down with me.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s overseas consulting work in eastern Europe stretches back to the mid-2000s. But his prominence in Ukraine grew after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, when he parlayed his close relationship with the president into security contracts and speaking appearances.\n\nBy his own account, Giuliani\u2019s fixation with the country began last November when, he told Fox News, he was approached by a \u201cvery significant distinguished investigator\u201d. He has not named the investigator, though the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and other sources have illuminated close ties between the former mayor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who until last month was Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor, and Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Shokin.\n\nAs the complaint sets out, Giuliani met Lutsenko at least twice: in New York in January and in Warsaw the following month. The timing of those encounters could be important in the rapidly unfolding impeachment inquiry in Washington, as they came at a key moment for Lutsenko.\n\nTrump, the whistleblower and the comic: key players in the Ukraine scandal Read more\n\nThe prosecutor was facing growing criticism in Kyiv over stalled investigations into corruption. In November 2018, when Giuliani says he began to focus on the country, Lutsenko offered to resign after a young anti-corruption activist, Kateryna Handziuk, died from a sulphuric acid attack.\n\nLutsenko stayed in office. But the Guardian has learned that he began seeking a lifeline to the US, in the hope it might save him as difficulties back home intensified.\n\nThat lifeline was Giuliani.\n\n\u201c[Lutsenko] strongly needed some political ally, he believed that Giuliani could convey specific messages to Trump, and he created this message to become more interesting to the American establishment,\u201d said a law enforcement source familiar with the Giuliani-Lutsenko connection.\n\nThat Giuliani might have been fed information by Ukraine\u2019s then-top prosecutor that was adulterated to make it more appealing to Trump is a startling potential twist in the developing scandal.\n\nAccording to the Guardian\u2019s source, Lutsenko appeared in conversation with Giuliani to have invented a \u201cdon\u2019t prosecute\u201d list he claimed was given to him by the then US ambassador to Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch \u2013 news of which apparently made its way up to Trump.\n\nYovanovitch was abruptly removed in May after Giuliani pressed for changes in the embassy. Giuliani has since claimed without evidence that the \u201cdon\u2019t prosecute\u201d list was part of a liberal anti-Trump conspiracy that included Yovanovitch and was bankrolled by the philanthropist George Soros.\n\nThe US state department has dismissed the claim as an \u201coutright fabrication\u201d.\n\n\u2018Very helpful to my client\u2019\n\nUkraine\u2019s main attraction for Giuliani was the hope it might provide valuable damaging intelligence on Biden, who launched his presidential bid in April. Both Giuliani and Trump have grown increasingly excited by a conspiracy theory that in 2016 Biden pressurized Ukraine to fire its then chief prosecutor, Shokin.\n\nUnder this theory, Biden wanted Shokin out because he was investigating the vice-president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of a major Ukrainian gas company, Burisma. Several attempts to fact check the story that Biden acted corruptly to protect his son have found it to be false.\n\nHere too, there is a suggestion that Lutsenko may have intentionally misrepresented the Burisma investigation to Giuliani, raising doubts about Hunter Biden\u2019s activities, as a ruse to catch the attention of Trump.\n\n\u201cMr Biden and his son were never the subjects of this investigation,\u201d the Guardian was told by the source with knowledge of Lutsenko\u2019s ties to the New York lawyer.\n\nLutsenko later changed his tune, and told the Washington Post this week Hunter Biden had done nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,\u201d the former prosecutor said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky meet in New York. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs the Ukraine affair has deepened, the extent of Guiliani\u2019s efforts to put flesh on the bones of his anti-Biden conspiracy theory has become clear. In addition to his meetings with Lutsenko, he made contact with a further four former Ukrainian prosecutors, including a Skype call to Shokin.\n\nThose efforts reached fever pitch in May when Giuliani laid plans to visit the president-elect, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Serhiy Leshchenko, a journalist and former member of parliament who advised Zelenskiy during his campaign, said he believed Giuliani was urgently trying to meet the president-elect before his 20 May inauguration, after which their interaction could be restricted by protocol.\n\nTrump's Ukraine call sparks new questions over intelligence chief's firing Read more\n\nWe know what Giuliani wanted to talk to Zelenskiy about because Giuliani, true to form, told us. In an interview with the New York Times on 9 May, he said he wanted to encourage the new government to investigate the Bidens, saying \u201cthat information will be very, very helpful to my client\u201d.\n\nThe backlash to his announced plan to engage with Ukraine for Trump\u2019s political benefit was so intense that he cancelled the May visit. He diverted instead to Spain, where he met Andriy Yermak \u2013 he now claims at the instigation of the state department.\n\nWhat did Giuliani say to Yermak, a top adviser to the new Ukrainian government?\n\n\u201cJust investigate the darn things,\u201d he said, referring to the Bidens and other matters beneficial to Trump\u2019s re-election hopes.\n\nIt is a sign of Giuliani\u2019s imperviousness to public condemnation \u2013 some would say to reason \u2013 that he continues to dig himself and his client deeper into a hole. It could have serious consequences for them both.\n\nLeshchenko believes Giuliani is in peril too.\n\n\u201cHe was involved in international politics and trying to blackmail the Ukrainian government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be a cause for an investigation.\u201d", "description": "Source tells Guardian prosecutor may have fed Trump lawyer altered information including supposed \u2018don\u2019t prosecute\u2019 list", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington", "Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7241e373161a817c273a6e86882414f89b5d9384/0_60_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b73b6c47c90e669ac8e5ea6e31ec365d", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
