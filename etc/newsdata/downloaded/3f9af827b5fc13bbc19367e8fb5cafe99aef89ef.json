First, we\u2019re not getting out of it. Second, the rest of the world is watching. Especially with all the other troubled aspects of its relationship with Trump just now, Ukraine must be rethinking the wisdom of relying on the United States for assistance. The eastern nations of NATO, especially the Baltics, would have good reason to look elsewhere for security guarantees. Already, traditional U.S. allies in Europe and Asia are exploring agreements, on security and trade, outside of Washington\u2019s orbit.", "description": "", "authors": ["Fred Kaplan", "Slate.Com News-And-Politics Trump-Kurds-World-Order-Betrayal.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
