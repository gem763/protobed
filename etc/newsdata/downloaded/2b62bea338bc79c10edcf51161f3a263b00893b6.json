The sector\u2019s CO2 emissions could reach 163 million tonnes by the end of 2023, but that could be cut by 16 million tonnes if its renewable intake is increased from 23% to 30%.\n\n\u201cTwenty years from now, it is possible that data centers and big data will account for a third of power consumption, three times as much as electric vehicles,\u201d said Emmanuel Lagarrigue, Chief Innovation Officer of Schneider Electric, which works with big internet and technology companies in the United States and China.\n\n\u201cIt is going to consume a lot of electricity but that doesn\u2019t mean it will be less sustainable - many of the players are thinking about how to innovate,\u201d he said.", "description": "China's burgeoning internet data sector will increase its power consumption by two-thirds by 2023, putting further pressure on the country's plans to curb smog and carbon emissions, according to a study published on Monday.", "authors": ["David Stanway", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
