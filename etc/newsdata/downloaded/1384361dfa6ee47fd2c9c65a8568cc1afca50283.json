While Yemen\u2019s Iranian-allied Houthi rebels claimed the assault, Saudi Arabia says it was \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Iran denies being responsible and has warned any retaliatory attack targeting it will result in an \u201call-out war.\u201d That\u2019s as it has begun enriching uranium beyond the terms of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from over a year earlier.\n\nRouhani spoke from a riser at the parade in Tehran, with uniformed officers from the country\u2019s military and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard beside him. The cleric later watched as goose-stepping soldiers carrying submachine guns and portable missile launchers drove past as part of \u201cHoly Defense Week,\u201d which marks the start of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Since 1980, it has viewed the region as crucial to its national security, given its energy exports. A fifth of all oil traded passes through the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf. The U.S. plans to send additional troops to the region over the tensions.\n\nMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

Commandos fast-roped down onto the deck of a ship, resembling Iran\u2019s July seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker.\n\nIranian ship seizures, as well as oil tanker explosions that the U.S. blames on Iran, saw America create a new coalition to protect Mideast waters. So far, Australia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to join it.\n\nIranian parliament speaker Ali Larijani called the U.S-led coalition a \u201ca new means for plundering the region,\u201d according to Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n\n\u201cWe regard the emergence of such coalitions as the start of a new game to make the region insecure,\u201d Larijani said, according to Tasnim.\n\nIran separately displayed its Khordad-3 surface-to-air missile that downed a U.S. military surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz in June.\n\nSunday also marked the one-year anniversary of an attack on a military parade in Ahvaz that killed 25 people. Both separatists and the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the assault, while Iran blamed Saudi Arabia and the UAE for allegedly supporting the attackers. Both nations denied the claim, though a propaganda video published by a semi-official news agency in Iran close to the Guard later circulated threatening them with missile attacks.\n\n", "description": "President Hassan Rouhani also promised to unveil a regional peace plan.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f2/02/ef206160498881894722f988e35f/20190922-iran-president-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
