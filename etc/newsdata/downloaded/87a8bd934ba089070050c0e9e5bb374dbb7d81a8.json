It is beyond Brexit - how you conduct politics and the veering towards populism and English nationalism,\" Gyimah wrote in an article for the Observer newspaper explaining his decision to change parties.\n\nGyimah, 43, was universities minister until November 2018, when he quit in opposition to then-Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans, and considered running for the leadership of the Conservative Party after she stepped down.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) banker's decision to change parties now takes the total number of Liberal Democrat legislators in the 650-seat lower house of parliament to 18.\n\nJohnson wants to hold a national election, something opposition parties have so far blocked, fearing he could still seek to achieve a no-deal Brexit. The Liberal Democrats want Britain to remain in the EU, despite 2016's referendum decision in favour of leaving.\n\nAn opinion poll by market research company Opinium for the Observer showed that the Conservatives had gained support over the past week, with Labour holding steady and the Liberal Democrats slipping back slightly.\n\nConservative support rose to 37% from 35%, while Jeremy Corbyn's Labour held at 25% and Liberal Democrat support dropped to 16% from 17%. Support for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party remained at 13%.", "description": "Former Conservative minister Gyimah joins Liberal Democrats over Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8D0QU_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
