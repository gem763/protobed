Reynolds describes his work as a much overdue appreciation of black models.\n\n\"'I've always been obsessed with models. I am the ultimate fan,\" Reynolds said. \"This book is a love letter to some incredible women who inspired me when I was a child and in my teenage years. Those girls and their pictures inspire you to dream.\"\n\nReynolds -- who is a stylist, host and former model himself -- relates to these women on a completely different scale.\n\nAs a child, Reynolds dreamed of runways, fashion and the editorial lifestyle he is now living but never thought he'd be able to achieve.\n\n\"This book is for 10-year-old Marcellas, who was bullied and didn't have any friends because he was a gay kid,\" Reynolds said. \"He would read Ebony and Jet from cover to cover because he just wanted something more.\"\n\nReynolds' latest work may have been eight years in the making, but the stories featured in the book span more than 70.\n\n\"When I set out to write \"Supreme Models,\" it wasn't supposed to be what it turned into,\" Reynolds explained to \"GMA.\" \"It was supposed to be a beautiful book about beautiful women, and it really is the history of black models in advertising, in fashion, in America, in the world.\"\n\n\u201c \u201d It was supposed to be a beautiful book about beautiful women, and it really is the history of black models.\n\n\"Supreme Models\" is as historical as it is visual. From the first black supermodel to the first black model on the covers of Glamour and Life magazines, the women featured exhibit true model behavior. Here are a few highlights.\n\nGrace Bol\n\nKuba Ryniewicz for VoguePolska via Abrams\n\nBol comes alive both on camera and off. She went from refugee to runway after fleeing South Sudan's civil war. She's best known for walking the 2017 and 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\n\n\"Each photo has a story,\" explained Reynolds. \"What's amazing about this one for me is that when I reached out to the photographer, he was so honored to be in the book.\"\n\nRose Cordero\n\nJohn-Paul Pietrus via Abrams\n\nReynolds writes: \"There must be something in the water in the Dominican Republic that produces so many stunning models.\"\n\nCordero made her debut walking for Burberry in 2009 and the cover above is from the African magazine Arise.\n\n\"That was something that was very important to me, to include black magazines,\" Reynolds said. \"You're going to see magazines like Vogue, you're going to see Harper's Bazaar, but you're also going to see magazines that are sort of for the culture.\"\n\nDaphne Maxwell Reid\n\nJack Ward /Glamour Cond\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNast via Abrams\n\nFrom being the first black woman on the cover of Glamour to being the first black homecoming queen of Northwestern University, Reid has her share of groundbreaking moments.\n\n\"Many people know her because she was the second Aunt Viv on 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,'\" Reynolds said. \"But Daphne has lived this amazing life full of firsts.\"\n\nNaiomi Sims\n\nYale Joel/The LIFE Premium Collection/Getty Images via Abrams\n\n\"Fight me -- Naiomi Sims is the first black super model,\" Reynolds said.\n\nWhile Iman and Beverly Johnson might give Sims a run for that title, she was the first black model on the cover of both Life and Ladies' Home Journal.\n\n\"This arrived in 14 million homes across the U.S.,\" Reynolds said about Sims' Journal magazine cover. \"This black face with natural hair broke boundaries.\"\n\nVeronica Webb\n\nAlbert Watson/Courtesy of Vogue Italia via Abrams\n\nFor Webb, there is no such thing as a model being off-duty. She has gone from actress to activist, supermodel to super-humanitarian, and has used her platform to create change in the world.\n\n\"She showed the world that being a model meant that you can use your platform to help others,\" Reynolds explained. \"She is the perfect example of model, humanitarian, just all-around good person.\"", "description": "Marcellas Reynolds shows us model behavior in", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/super-models-1-ht-ps-ht-ps-191010-_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2010-10-19"}
