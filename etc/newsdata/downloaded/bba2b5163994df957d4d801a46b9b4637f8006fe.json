The Farewell is a welcome addition to a new canon that depicts the contemporary Asian-American experience. As a mixed-race woman who was not born or raised in her parents\u2019 home country/culture, I found the depiction of the complex east-west family dynamics highly resonant, particularly around the themes of belonging and not belonging. I also shed quite a few tears in the process.\n\nThe Farewell reaches cinemas as the US-China trade war continues to send shockwaves through the global economy; it is far more political than I could have imagined. Starring Crazy Rich Asians alum Awkwafina as Billi, a Chinese-American woman who discovers her grandmother, or nai nai in Mandarin, has terminal lung cancer and has only a few months left to live. However, her family have wrongly \u2013 in Billi\u2019s opinion \u2013 withheld the truth from her grandmother: a common practice in China, as well as in Japan and Singapore. In an attempt to reconcile their so-called \u201cemotional burden\u201d, the family travel to Nai Nai\u2019s home in Changchun, the capital of north-east Jilin province, to stage a fake wedding between her cousin and his Japanese girlfriend so that the entire extended family can bid Nai-Nai a final farewell.\n\nThe setup may seem outlandish, but it is based on Wang\u2019s own family history. \u201cBased on an actual lie\u201d reads an epigraph on screen at the start of the film.\n\nThe family\u2019s decision to tell a \u201cgood lie\u201d is a metaphor for the collective delusion of living under the Chinese Communist party. Billi\u2019s guilt at harbouring this secret is beautifully reflected in the plastic-facade setting of Changchun \u2013 the seedy hotels, outdated banqueting halls and concrete tower blocks built next to smoggy highways suggests this \u201cperformance\u201d will eventually eat away at one\u2019s soul.\n\nHollywood has removed Taiwanese flags from Tom Cruise's jacket in the new Top Gun movie\n\nThe Farewell is a co-production with Chinese film companies, meaning it avoids the country\u2019s strict foreign-film quota and will be eligible for distribution in China. Cinema has become a key battleground in the trade war between the US and China; as reported by Variety, Chinese film officials have begun to advise Chinese buyers against purchasing Hollywood titles. Recently, Hollywood has been seen to appease state censorship by removing the Taiwanese and Japanese flags from Tom Cruise\u2019s jacket for the sequel of Top Gun (a film partly funded by Chinese corporate monolith TenCent, the company behind WeChat). Meanwhile, the support for Hong Kong police brutality expressed by naturalised American citizen Crystal Liu \u2013 star of Disney\u2019s forthcoming Mulan \u2013 has prompted a #boycottmulan backlash.\n\nThe big-budget Crazy Rich Asians, which was a tour through the lives of the rich in Singapore, bombed at the Chinese box office, and it has been suggested this was partly because the protagonist Rachel was seen as a \u201crace traitor\u201d. But The Farewell, which was shot primarily in Changchun \u2013 home to one of China\u2019s largest film production bases and a magnet for international students \u2013 offers an ideal opportunity to discuss issues surrounding China\u2019s generational divide, its slowing economy, the one-China policy, and its future as a superpower.\n\nHowever, to anyone who has lived the immigrant experience after their family were forced to flee during the Cultural Revolution, the \u201cperformance\u201d of Chinese society \u2013 embodied by lying to the grandmother, and the scathing commentary on hypocritical traditions (such as paying for mourners to cry at funerals) \u2013 rings sadly true. Critics have noted the film\u2019s importance in the depiction of what immigrants leave behind. But, in depicting the differences between western and Chinese family values, Wang has highlighted the ideological battle between China and the US. The Farewell might be the spark that Hollywood needs to reignite its dwindling relationship with China and, in turn, China\u2019s with the rest of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "A film depicting a young Chinese-American woman\u2019s experience highlights differences between the two countries \u2013 but may also signal hope for the future", "authors": ["Jingan Young"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6af126ca7093fcb660bc76913f97a2633cc92f0e/151_0_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=51fffc0666b4e04022b7ee7468e5fe91", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
