The Fed has so far never turned it on, but it is now considering whether to integrate the tool into a plan proposed last year to overhaul the annual exercise that tests big banks\u2019 ability to weather a doomsday scenario.\n\nThe proposed changes are part of a broader effort by the Fed and other banking regulators to simplify the financial rulebook implemented after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\u201cOur financial system today is far more resilient than it was before the crisis, and I want to maintain that resiliency,\u201d Mr. Quarles said in the remarks. \u201cBut now that banks have built significant capital stores, I believe the overlapping requirements should be combined for efficiency and simplicity.\u201d\n\nMr. Quarles recommended removing an assumption that banks have already paid their dividends to shareholders before undergoing hypothetical market shocks under the stress tests, effectively increasing the amount of capital they have to set aside.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nBecause banks tend to pay out more in dividends during a growing economy, some economists have argued that this tendency has made the tests tougher in good times, making them more countercyclical.\n\nThat means it goes against banks\u2019 impulses to lend too much when the economy might be overheating and to hoard capital when the economy faces potential liquidity shortages.\n\n\u201cLimiting pro-cyclicality, or being countercyclical, essentially means limiting both the highs and lows of a business cycle,\u201d Mr. Quarles said. \u201cWith a countercyclical stress test, as the economy strengthens, the test should get tougher and be more stringent to mitigate the buildup of vulnerabilities during good times.\u201d\n\nMr. Quarles proposed two ways to achieve the countercyclical effect as a counterpoint to eliminating the requirement that banks pre-fund dividends in the stress tests.\n\nOne option, he said, is to turn on the countercyclical capital buffer, a tool that allows the Fed to turn the dial up or down depending on the state of the economy.\n\nIn a downturn, the requirements could be lowered, encouraging banks to lend during a credit crunch. In good times, they could be increased to fight asset bubbles.\n\nMr. Quarles argued that the tool is underused in the U.S. because banks already face high capital requirements in both good and bad times.\n\n\u201cVulnerabilities have indeed been rising in recent years, but because of the strength of our capital requirements and [stress tests], our assessment of overall vulnerabilities remains moderate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis raises the question of whether our through-the-cycle capital levels in the United States have been set so high that our countercyclical capital buffer is effectively already \u2018on.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstead, Mr. Quarles suggested artificially turning up the dial up while keeping overall capital levels steady by integrating the countercyclical capital buffer into the rest of the big-bank-capital framework.\n\nThis could allow the Fed to use the tool more readily, he said.\n\n\u201cThis kind of shift would provide the Board with a helpful, additional tool that could be adjusted quickly in response to economic, financial or even geopolitical shocks,\u201d said Mr. Quarles.\n\nMr. Quarles also proposed another option to make stress tests more countercyclical. The Fed could increase the floor of the capital requirements faced by banks under the new regime. Such a move could act as a counterweight to banks\u2019 performing well in the stress tests during good times and badly in a downturn, he said.\n\nWrite to Lalita Clozel at lalita.clozel.@wsj.com", "description": "The Federal Reserve is thinking about activating a dormant tool to combat credit crunches in a downturn as part of a broader overhaul.", "authors": ["Lalita Clozel", "Lalita.Clozel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104110/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
