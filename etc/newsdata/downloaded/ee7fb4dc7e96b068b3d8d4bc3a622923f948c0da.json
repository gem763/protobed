The Taliban maintains an alliance with al-Qaeda to this day.\n\nAccording to the Long War Journal, Taliban jihadis reprinted a 2001 Guardian interview with its founder and first emir, Mullah Mohammed Omar.\n\nIn an article titled \u201c7th October: A Black Day in the history of Afghanistan\u201d appearing on the Taliban website Voice of Jihad, the group claimed that \u201cthe words of the late Emir still echo in the ears of all the Mujahideen.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks before the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, Omar expressed confidence that Allah was on their side, and that they would prevail in any conflict:\n\nAlmighty Allah\u2026 is helping the believers and the Muslims. Allah says he will never be satisfied with the infidels. In terms of worldly affairs, America is very strong,\u201d Omar said. \u201cEven if it were twice as strong or twice that, it could not be strong enough to defeat us. We are confident that no one can harm us if Allah is with us.\n\nYears later, the Taliban would attempt to rewrite history, claiming that it would have released Osama bin Laden into U.S. custody if evidence of his involvement in the September 11 attacks was provided. While Taliban Deputy Prime Minister Haji Abdul Kabir asked the U.S. to halt its airstrikes while it considered releasing the terrorist leader, Omar rejected the notion outright.\n\nThe Taliban continues to deny al-Qaeda\u2019s involvement in 9/11 despite longstanding evidence to the contrary. In an August 2019 interview with CBS News, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen asserted that the group was \u201cready to try [al-Qaeda]\u201d if \u201cthere is proof given to us.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban maintains that the U.S. deserved September 11, calling it \u201ca heavy slap on [America\u2019s] dark faces\u201d and a direct consequence of our country\u2019s \u201cinterventionist policies\u201d in a video released in July.\n\n\u201cPeople of the World! Western imperialists and transgressors are lying to you,\u201d it said, continuing:\n\nThey neither care for the security of their own people, nor for ours and yours. If they truly cared about national and international security, then they would have ended their interventionist policies against the oppressed Muslims.\n\nThe video ends with an Oscars-esque memoriam to several suicide bombers.\n\n\u201c7th October this year should be another reminder for all the enemies of Afghanistan that no one can ever forcefully subdue Afghans and take their sovereignty and independence,\u201d the group wrote yesterday on the aforementioned Voice of Jihad nearly two decades after the war on terror formally began, continuing:\n\nThe Americans should know that they have to withdraw from Afghanistan otherwise their soldiers will keep getting slaughtered like sheep, their children orphaned and wives widowed. Their economy will be under strain and the final outcome will be the misery and shame which they are facing.\n\n\u201cThe American invaders should know that the only solution for ending the war in Afghanistan is the complete withdrawal of the American forces from Afghanistan,\u201d it said. \u201cThey must understand that the Mujahideen will fight the invaders for another 18 years until this demand is met.\u201d", "description": "The Taliban posted a past interview with its founder on the 18th anniversary of its ongoing war with America.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Taliban-members-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
