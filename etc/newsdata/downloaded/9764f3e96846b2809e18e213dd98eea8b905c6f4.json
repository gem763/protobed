If we ask you to evacuate, please evacuate,\" he urged residents.\n\nHe said some 1 000 firefighters were fighting the blaze that was zero percent contained in early morning and which forced the partial shutdown of several major highways.\n\nThe metro line in the area was also shut down.\n\n\"We've calculated that the fire is moving at a rate of 800 acres per hour,\" Terrazas said, adding that it would probably take days to get it under control.\n\nSome 200 firefighters and helicopters were meanwhile battling the brush fire - dubbed the Sandlewood fire - that tore through the mobile home park.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries, but authorities ordered some 1 900 homes in the area be evacuated.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said on Twitter it had declared a \"citywide tactical alert\".\n\nEvacuation centres are open for those forced to leave their homes, said LA mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\nIn the dark\n\nWeather forecasters have warned of more strong winds and \"extremely critical fire\" conditions Friday and state authorities have issued their highest fire alert - a red flag warning.\n\nThe wildfires erupted as California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), implemented rolling power blackouts that affected some two million people in Northern California this week.\n\nAbout 312 000 customers remained in the dark Friday as a result of the shutoffs designed to reduce the threat of wildfire that can be sparked by lines downed in heavy winds.\n\nMany schools and universities were also closed in northern parts of the state as people stocked up on gasoline, water, batteries and other basics, with frustration mounting at the blackouts condemned by some as \"third world.\"\n\n\"We're seeing a scale and scope of something that no state in the 21st century should experience,\" Governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday, blaming decades of what he called neglect and mismanagement by PG&E.\n\n\"This is not, from my perspective, a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades,\" Newsom said. \"Neglect, a desire to advance not public safety but profits.\"\n\nPG&E has defended the outages as necessary for safety reasons and has said it will take days before power is restored to all customers as inspections must be conducted on power lines in all of the affected areas.\n\n\"This is not how we want to serve you but blackouts can happen again,\" Bill Johnson, the CEO of the company said on Thursday.\n\nLast November, PG&E's faulty power lines were determined to have sparked the deadliest wildfire in the state's modern history, which killed 86 and destroyed the town of Paradise.", "description": "Much of California was on high alert as wind-driven wildfires tore through the state's south, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people and destroying multiple structures and homes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2824/3f526f68484c46058195f3adb336320d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
