According to World Cup in Numbers, 23% of foreign fans are from England, 15.6% Australia and 7.9% Ireland. South Africans make up 3.1% of the total visitors.\n\nWe dreamt up a few stunning destinations that could throw an amazing World Cup - even if their team is a little low in the rankings (we're still so sorry Namibia).\n\nAt least these places are less prone to a typhoon disrupting the games.\n\nSEE: A dozen delights from the Japanese cities hosting the 2019 Rugby World Cup\n\nIreland\n\nOut of all the countries that were in the running for the 2023 bid, Ireland should have been the top pick outside of South Africa - Guinness flowing through the streets, traditional pubs filled to the brim with spectators and the general revelry that the Irish are known for - and it's visa-free for South Africans!\n\nOn home soil they might even forgive the Japanese for kicking them out in the quarter-finals.\n\nHost city: Of course it would be Dublin, the literary heart of Irish culture where everything in the city centre is an easy walking distance - perfect for pub crawling.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO IRELAND: Visa-free travel for South Africans\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nWhile the national team isn't high in the rankings, out of all the nationalities attending Japan's World Cup the Netherlands is in tenth place, just behind South Africans according to Rugby World Cup in Numbers. They can swop out most of their football stadiums to be suitable for rugby, and seeing as everything is so flat it would make a perfect training ground for the players.\n\nHost city: The National Rugby Centre is situated in Amsterdam, but Rotterdam would be a better fit to hold the crowds with their De Kuip stadium and stroll through amazing modern architecture on your way to a match.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO THE NETHERLANDS: Going Dutch for your next Euro trip\n\nNamibia\n\nHear me out - you know that every Namibian will be attending all the games, and for us South Africans it's just a quick hop across the border to hopefully see our Bokke apologise for this year's thrashing. German beer mixed in with some oshiWambo spirit could turn it into a party that would rival the Irish.\n\nWe'd only hope they pull a Qatar and build stadiums with air-conditioning.\n\nHost city: Namibia only has one city - Windhoek - where you can buy cheap meat for braais and haggle your way through curio stalls where they would fully embrace the World Cup theme. Just bring some extra water with.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO NAMIBIA: Visa-free travel for South Africans\n\nArgentina\n\nLike us, Argentinians also love their meat and a good braai, so we'll feel right at home among the valleys and vineyards of this South American country. They've clawed their way into one of the top-ranking teams in the world, and deserve a little love despite their terrible loss at this year's World Cup.\n\nAlso the exchange rate is very favourable to South Africans.\n\nHost city: Buenos Aires has two major stadiums, where you can explore the colourful streets of La Boca and pop into a steakhouse to drown your sorrows if your team lost.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO ARGENTINA: Visa-free travel for South Africans\n\nItaly\n\nThe sun, the food, the wine - mix rugby into the equation and you'll be guaranteed a World Cup experience that will make your pants a lot tighter - in a happy way. It will also give them a chance to host games in cities and towns outside of the congested tourism cities, showing there's more to do than take a gondola ride down the canals of Venice.\n\nHost city: Watch players dominate in the shadow of The Alps in Turin at their giant Juventus stadium, or indulge in some cultural pleasure at the plethora of museums for when your heart needs a break from all the action.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO ITALY: The Mamma Mia of your Italy trip planning sorted!\n\nUS\n\nWith all their American football obsessions, rugby is actually quite a major sport in the US and they've got the infrastructure to pull off a well-oiled World Cup.\n\nAlthough their strict visa policies could become a major headache.\n\nHost city: The massive 61 500-capacity NFL stadium that doubles as a rugby stadium is Soldier Field in Chicago - and the city itself has so much on offer from the Millennium Park to its iconic skyline.\n\nREAD: Airline ticket pricing first interaction with a destination: Why the Cape Town direct flight to New York is important\n\nCanada\n\nLike the US, Canada also has the money to host a streamlined World Cup - if you can tear the Canadians away from their obsession with ice hockey. Mountainous landscapes and the friendliest people in the world, you know the locals would help break up bar fights before they even begin.\n\nAs long as the World Cup takes place in summer.\n\nHost city: Toronto is the way to go, nestled next to Lake Ontario as the iconic CN Tower watches over the matches played at the heart of Canadian rugby - the BMO Field.\n\nWATCH: Go white-water rafting through Canada's Exploits River\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe national Malaysia team has never played in the World Cup - but they are trying very hard to qualify. While a wild card, the country actually has one of the most registered rugby players in the world (13th) and is part of the growing love for the game in Asia.\n\nWhen your team is giving you too much stress, you can just go relax on a beach or centre yourself at a Hindu temple.\n\nHost city: The country's first stadium will be built in Putrajaya, a city south of Kuala Lumpur known for its unique domed mosques and architecture.\n\nQUICK GUIDE TO MALAYSIA: Make memories in Malaysia\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
