It traded as low as $251.35 in the regular session.\n\nThe results were much better than expected, but Tesla has been there before, said Garrett Nelson, an analyst with CFRA.\n\n\u201cWe think questions remain regarding the sustainability of these results, particularly as EV competition ramps up and its tax credit goes away,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a call with Wall Street analysts following results, Tesla executives reiterated that both the \u201cgigafactory\u201d in China and the Model Y, Tesla\u2019s next vehicle, are ahead of schedule; reaffirmed the goal to remain in the black; and said they believe the Model Y, which will be more profitable, won\u2019t cannibalize Model 3 sales.\n\nChief Executive Elon Musk also said that the company will unveil a third iteration of its solar roof on Thursday, and called Tesla\u2019s energy business the company\u2019s least appreciated unit.\n\nProduction of the Model Y, a compact SUV, is now seen starting in the summer of 2020, from a previous expectation of fall 2020. The Shanghai plant is \u201cready for production\u201d and a \u201ctrial production\u201d of the Model 3 there has started, Tesla said in its letter to shareholders.\n\nInvestors had braced for a drop in quarterly sales despite an uptick for deliveries, mostly thanks to a mix of deliveries that skewed heavily toward the Model 3, Tesla\u2019s cheapest vehicle.\n\nTesla moved to dispel some of the concerns about margins, saying that despite \u201creductions in the average selling price (ASP) of Model 3 as global mix stabilizes, our gross margins have strengthened\u201d while expenses were at its lowest since the start of Model 3 production.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we returned to GAAP profitability in Q3 while generating positive free cash flow. This was possible by removing substantial cost from our business,\u201d the company said.\n\nTesla pinned the revenue miss on the percentage of leased vehicles, which has tripled, it said.\n\nRelated: Slowdown fears, trade wars hit sales at major industrial companies\n\nTesla also called for GAAP profits and free cash flow going forward with \u201cpossible temporary exceptions\u201d around the launch and production ramp of new products. \u201cContinuous volume growth, capacity expansion, and cash generation remain the main focus,\u201d Tesla said.\n\nThe company earlier this month reported third-quarter deliveries, its proxy for sales, that fell short of expectations. Tesla said it delivered about 97,000 vehicles in the third quarter, including 79,600 Model 3 sedans. The car maker delivered 84,000 vehicles in the third quarter of 2018, including about 56,000 Model 3\u2019s.\n\nSee also: Boeing\u2019s \u2018downward spiral\u2019 sinks stock\n\nTesla said Wednesday it was \u201chighly confident\u201d in selling more than 360,000 vehicles in 2019. That will mean that it needs to deliver at least 105,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter. In the past, the company has spoken of selling between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in the year.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Ford Motor Co. reported third-quarter revenue and adjusted profit above Wall Street expectations, but lowered its outlook on increased headwinds in the fourth quarter, including lower volumes in China and higher-than-planned sales incentives in North America.\n\nTesla shares have lost about 23% this year, and 13% in the past 12 months. That contrasts with gains of 20% and 15% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.28% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.17% this year, respectively, and advances of 10% and 7% for the indexes in the past 12 months.", "description": "Tesla Inc. shares soar late Wednesday after the Silicon Valley car maker reported a surprise quarterly profit and said key projects were ahead of schedule.", "authors": ["Claudia Assis"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT875_tesla1_ZG_20191023134011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
