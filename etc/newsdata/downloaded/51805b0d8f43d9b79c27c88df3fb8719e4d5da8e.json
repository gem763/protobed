You may not be able to commit to his marathon 14 outfit changes in three days, but you can cop some style tips from the singer and his fellow over-dressers. Below are the ten commandments of pretending you, too, are front row at fashion week\u2014and looking as good as Porter and Co. (Mostly Porter\u2014there is never enough Billy Porter.)\n\nLook Like You\u2019re From The Future, but Also 1974\n\nThe only way Porter\u2019s chunky heels and bellbottoms could get any more plucked-from-the-\u201970s is if the actor accessorized both looks with a newspaper clipping about the Patricia Hearst kidnapping. But before we mount a revival of Company using these outfits, let\u2019s also appreciate the futuristic elements. There\u2019s a nod to moonstone in his jewelry, and his bedazzled choker sublimely reeks of space age kitsch.\n\nMeanwhile, Christina Aguilera turned herself into Cruella de Vil turned Tesla Roadster investor, because the 101 Dalmatians character would totally be into that sort of thing were she real.\n\nDon\u2019t Even Bother If You\u2019re Not Going to Wear a Hat\n\nRespectfully, if you\u2019re not going to put a hat on your non-famous head, please do not speak to me. That\u2019s the mood of the (very famous) Porter and Rita Ora, who both displayed the actual opposite of restraint when it came to headwear. Ora chose a very British pork pie tweed number that would be a little too \u201clisten-to-my-jazz-band-on-Spotify-we-make-84-cents-a-stream\u201d were it not on the head of a very famous supermodel.\n\nLike many Americans before him, Billy opted for an out-of-this-world fascinator during his London vacation. Unlike some attempts (cough Meghan Markle cough), this one worked brilliantly.\n\nBlack Is Not Boring As Long as Its Shape Makes You Look Like You Have Extra Vestiges\n\nBlack gets a \u201csafe\u201d reputation, so much so that Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour reportedly hates when staffers wear the color. But in a week full of protests, celebrities are bravely pushing back against that assumption, wearing all-black but keeping things interesting in bulbous shapes that can probably hide so many snacks.\n\nAguilera went full parachute dominatrix, with BDSM-inspired gloves and a cape that could probably defy gravity. FKA Twigs rolled into Burberry\u2019s show with oversized sleeves, also known as the peak of luxury since the feature gets in the way of doing anything even remotely laborious. And Daniel Lismore, a London-based artist I very much want to go shopping with, donned a gloriously tiered black blouse.\n\nIf You\u2019re Rich, Wear Red\n\nSome of the week\u2019s most choicest VIPs brought out a very regal crimson hue when it came time for their closeup. In a crown/cape/jumpsuit concoction she should just wear every day of the week, Naomi Campbell looked so much like a queen she may be the biggest threat to the monarchy since Napoleon. Aguilera continued her reign as Keeper of the Trench Coats in a Gaga-esque shiny vinyl number. And yes, again, Porter looked very casually fabulous\u2014what else is new? The tulle leggings almost look like what he\u2019d wear lounging at home, instead of your plebeian sweatpants.\n\nFriends Are Accessories\n\nSure, It bags are cool and all, but letting the world know that you\u2019re liked and loved is next level. Porter did so very sweetly, pairing his fishnets and \u201cFuck You, Pay Me\u201d handbag with his husband Adam Smith. Carla Bruni and Isabelle Huppert made a very French splash (splash\u00e9?) in matching black suits. At Erdem, Miss Fame and Aquaria served sweeping, feathery frocks.\n\nShow the World That You Read!\n\nBella Hadid, an avid book person, wore a corset shirt blazed with the words, \u201cNature makes the whole world kin/Now I will believe that there are unicorns.\u201d The words were designed by Burberry, but taken from both Troilus and Cressida and The Tempest. Also at Burberry were Joan Smalls and Rosalia, who both wore a lot of words on their sleeves, and chests, and basically entire top halves.\n\nTie Your Sweater Around Your Waist with Abandon\n\nThis style was once reserved for tourist mommies who got too hot while walking around the city, but it has been appropriated by some famous young men. Anwar Hadid casually tied his Burberry plaid sweater around his chest as if it were armor, and K-pop singer Lucas Wong snapped jubilantly as he arrived at the show with a Fair Isle jumper slung from his hips. Rayer Van Ristell, a British blogger and model, fully lived up to his John Hughes, country club-attending rich kid villain name by gently toting a Valentino sweater over his shoulders.\n\nEmbrace Your Inner Animal (or At Least Your Favorite Aunt)\n\nThe animal print craze shows no sign of stopping, but now famous fans of the trend are fully embracing its kitschy connotations. Helen Mirren went full snakeskin at Victoria Beckham\u2019s show, Anna Wintour channeled a cheetah, and Eve pulled a cow print.\n\nBecome the Statue of Liberty\n\nLast week, one Fenty fan tweeted a photo of Rihanna in a mint green dress, very appropriately captioning the look, \u201cStatue of Liberty your times up.\u201d Now, a deluge of Lady Liberty-esque looks have hit London fashion week, perhaps best displayed by Leomie Anderson getting her angles in a one shouldered chartreuse dress. The Spanish model Nieves Alvarez also had a very admirable attempt, and of course Porter did the most in a floral overcoat.\n\nHot Girl Summer Is Over. Long Live Traffic Court Fall.\n\nCelebrity court style is damn fun to follow, but with Felicity Huffman behind bars now, who will we have to represent? Luckily, the likes of Naomi Campbell, Lily Aldridge, and Lily James bravely suited up in varying shades of tan, also for the Burberry showing, to show us how to dress when one is summoned to traffic court.
