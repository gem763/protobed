Of course, this could mean a person is in a graduate program and still using his or her home address. And living at home doesn\u2019t mean a person is unemployed. Census data suggests most such individuals do have jobs.\n\nLike which school you attend, what you major in seems to have the most bearing on the years just after school. While half of English majors live at home right out of college\u2013including this reporter, for several months\u2013only about a third of Engineering majors do. By age 29, however, the difference has dropped to 5 points (12 percent of English majors and 7 percent of Engineering majors.) This is generally true across the board.\n\nSo major in what you like. The worst that can happen is you\u2019ll be living at home for an extra year or two. See below for the rates for every major.\n\nMajor Percent living at home at age\u2026 22 25 29\n\nMethodology\n\nUsing Census microdata from 2009-2013, individuals were considered to be living at home if either of the variables MOMLOC or POPLOC were equal to 1, meaning a parent was the head of the household. Only those with completed bachelor\u2019s degrees between ages 22 and 29 were examined.\n\nData source: IPUMS-USA, University of Minnesota, www.ipums.org.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/major_share.png"}
