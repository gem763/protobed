(Murad Sezer/Reuters)\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a warning to the European Union during a speech to his party on Thursday, threatening to flood the continent with millions of refugees in response to international criticism of Turkey\u2019s recent military offensive in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cHey EU, wake up. I say it again: if you try to frame our operation there as an invasion, our task is simple: we will open the doors and send 3.6 million migrants to you,\u201d Erdogan said in the speech. The public opinion over Erdogan\u2019s actions has largely been negative.\n\nOn Thursday, France\u2019s foreign ministry requested the Turkish ambassador, Ismail Hakki Musa, speak in Paris about the recent attacks, according to sources. Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio also called for an immediate end to the fighting.\n\n\u201cAs a government we think that the Turkish offensive initiative is unacceptable. We condemn it \u2026 because military action in the past has always led to more terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe call for an immediate end to this offensive which is absolutely not acceptable given that the use of force continues to endanger the life of the Syrian people, who have already experienced tragedy in recent years.\u201d\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement Thursday joining his European counterparts in calling for Turkey to end its attacks against the Kurds. \u201cIsrael strongly condemns the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish areas in Syria and warns against the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds by Turkey and its proxies. Israel is prepared to extend humanitarian assistance to the gallant Kurdish people,\u201d he said.\n\nIran, a close ally of the Syrian government, called for the Turks to halt their advance, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would push for the necessity of dialogue between Turkey and Syria.\u201d\n\nDuring the Thursday rally, an inflammatory Erdogan defended his government\u2019s decision-making and accused other countries of being dishonest in their criticisms.\n\n\u201cThey are not honest, they just make up words,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, however, create action and that is our difference.\u201d", "description": "During a Thursday rally, an inflammatory Erdogan defended Turkey\u2019s decision-making and accused other countries of being dishonest in their criticisms.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
