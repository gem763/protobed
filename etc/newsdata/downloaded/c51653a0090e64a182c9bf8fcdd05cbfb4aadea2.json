And Russia. And voter suppression. And \u2026", "language": "en", "text": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s explanations for her 2016 loss now exceed the number of theories regarding the finale of The Sopranos. (The correct interpretation for the latter can be found here. You\u2019re welcome.) Nearly three years later, Hillary showed up on ABC\u2019s The View to offer yet another reason she turned out to be the one Democrat who could lose to Donald Trump. America was not prepared for Hillary Clinton, Serious Candidate, Clinton told the co-hosts.\n\nWell, that and Russia and voter suppression and sexism too, but seriously, seriousness:\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m a serious person but I\u2019m also a fun person but I think I probably came across as too serious,\u201d Clinton said Wednesday on ABC\u2019s The View when asked what she could have done differently in 2016. The View host Meghan McCain said her father, the late Sen. John McCain, also thought she was fun to hang out with on trips. The former Secretary of State said that she thought she overcompensated with her serious side because she wanted Americans to take the first potential woman president seriously. \u201cI really believed that my job, especially as a woman and the first woman to go as far as I did, that I had to help people feel good about a woman in the Oval Office, a woman commander in chief,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, so, I may have over corrected a little bit because sometimes people say, \u2018Why can\u2019t you be like that or why weren\u2019t you like that.\u2019 I did feel a heavy sense of responsibility and it was such that, you know, maybe I wasn\u2019t as loose or open as I could have been. I take responsibility for everything I didn\u2019t do as well or my campaign didn\u2019t do as well.\u201d\n\nTwitchy has the show\u2019s Twitter clip in which the discussion about Russia goes on a little longer, after which Hillary again says without any evidence that Stacey Abrams lost because of voter suppression. Perhaps this isn\u2019t so much as a new hypothesis as it is an addition to the agglomeration to the Unified Field Theory Of Hillary\u2019s Victimization:\n\nHillary Clinton says she \u201cprobably came across as too serious\u201d in the 2016 election. \u201cI really believed that my job, especially as a woman and the first woman to go as far as I did, that I had to help people feel good about a woman in the Oval Office.\u201d https://t.co/RvxQOidDMF pic.twitter.com/JzkW6lWx0D \u2014 The View (@TheView) October 3, 2019\n\nWhatevs. The most charming parts of this clip involve the comments made by presidential candidate daughters Abby Huntsman and Meghan McCain, especially the latter\u2019s recollection of her late father\u2019s fun with Hillary while traveling. The least charming by far are the by-now-serial attempts by Hillary to place the blame for her loss on everyone but herself. At one point, Hillary says that she\u2019ll take responsibility for the things she did wrong. We\u2019re still waiting.\n\nWhile I watched this clip, my wife remarked, \u201cShe\u2019s running again.\u201d Donald Trump couldn\u2019t get that lucky again, could he?", "description": "\"And, so, I may have over corrected a little bit ...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hillary-view.png"}
