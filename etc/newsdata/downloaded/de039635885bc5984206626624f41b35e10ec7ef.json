Biden.\n\n\u201cAs far as withholding funds, they were paid,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the United Nations. \u201cThey were fully paid. I want other countries to put up money. People called me and said \u2018let it go,\u2019 and I let it go.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, citing a whistleblower\u2019s complaint against the president, are accusing him of delaying $250 million in aid for Ukraine in an effort to force that country\u2019s president to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative post with a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nThe complaint allegedly cites a phone conversation that Mr. Trump had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in late July. The administration has resisted turning over the details of the complaint or a transcript of the phone call, but the president said Tuesday the White House will likely release a \u201creadout\u201d of the call \u2014 essentially a summary disclosing only what administration officials choose to release.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the readout of the call, which I assume you\u2019ll see at some point, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cThat call was perfect. It couldn\u2019t have been nicer. There was no pressure put on them whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe president said Tuesday that, similar to his complaints about NATO members not paying their fair share for the common defense of Europe, other European allies should be contributing more to protect Ukraine from Russian aggression.\n\n\u201cWe paid the money,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut very importantly, Germany, France, other countries should put up money. And that\u2019s been my complaint from the beginning.\u201d\n\nResponding to growing calls among congressional Democrats for his impeachment, Mr. Trump said their rationale is \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a witch hunt,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m leading in the polls, they [Democrats] have no idea how they stop me. They only way they can try is through impeachment. This has never happened to a president before.\u201d\n\nHe said Mr. Biden, while he was vice president in 2016, did pressure Ukrainian leaders to fire the prosecutor whose office had been investigating the gas company. Mr. Biden said he threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees because the prosecutor wasn\u2019t pursuing corruption.\n\n\u201cWhat Joe Biden did for his son \u2014 that\u2019s something they should be looking at,\u201d the president said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
