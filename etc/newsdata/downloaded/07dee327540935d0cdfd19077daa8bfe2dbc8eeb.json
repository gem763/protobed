(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nBoth outlets are tendentious, partisan, biased, and relentlessly propagandistic for their own side.\n\nCNN went apesnit Friday night on the news that Facebook had tapped Breitbart as one of the sources for its new \u201cnews tab.\u201d National Review was also tapped, indicating that Facebook is making an effort to be inclusive in its understanding of what news is. Perhaps Facebook has noticed that a declared ideological agenda, as opposed to an undeclared one, is insufficient cause for disregarding a media outlet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCNN\u2019s Brian Stelter used a chunk of his Friday-night newsletter to waste everyone\u2019s time reporting that various like-minded individuals were of like mind; literally all of the \u201cexperts\u201d he contacted for comment about the inclusion of Breitbart were established anti-Breitbarters who he knew would provide him with anti-Breitbart comments. Why reporters continue to launder their opinions through cherry-picked experts, professors, wonks, and fellow journos is a mystery. Why not just tell us what you, Brian Stelter, obviously think, which is that Breitbart is beyond the pale and ought not be admitted in polite company? Make the case, Brian Stelter! Don\u2019t hide behind your friends\u2019 opinions. The case can very easily be made. Except . . . not by you.\n\nThe argument I present is not an ad hominem one. It\u2019s a question of the proper credentials for membership in an exclusive club. Breitbart\u2019s willingness to slant the facts in service of its narratives about immigration, crime, and Islam is comparable to CNN\u2019s disregard for balance on these subjects and others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost everything Breitbart presents is the truth, or at least arguably the truth. The problem with Breitbart is that it is tendentious, partisan, and biased, relentlessly propagandistic for its side and less interested in the pursuit of truth than in scoring points.\n\nSo is CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreitbart plays up true information that advances its worldview while downplaying or pushing back against true information it sees as damaging to its cause.\n\nSo does CNN.\n\nBreitbart regularly resorts to name-calling, exaggeration, and even outright hysteria.\n\nSo does CNN.\n\nBreitbart can hardly get through a single story without nudging reminders of how it wants you to think. The same is true for CNN. Breitbart is spectacularly unfair to its ideological opponents and cares very little about whether it is using facts in a misleading way. Such is the case with CNN. The only real differences I can detect between the two outlets are that CNN occasionally presents an item on, say, the weather, that gives us a brief break from partisan haranguing, and CNN occasionally makes a half-hearted gesture in the direction of inclusion by, say, inviting Jeffrey Lord on a discussion panel that includes seven, or nine, or ten Trump haters. Or at least it used to invite Lord. Note that CNN fired Lord when he sarcastically said, \u201cSieg Heil\u201d in a tweet that accused someone else of being a fascist, which he clearly was labeling a bad thing, not praising fascism or identifying with it. CNN, typically, proved that it was either too stupid to understand how insults work or too cowardly to ignore the bleating herds of Twitter sheep who pretended to misunderstand the remark. \u201cNazi salutes are indefensible,\u201d CNN said in its statement of dudgeon. \u201cJeffrey Lord is no longer with the network.\u201d\n\nIt was just a few days ago that Jake Tapper outrageously tarred Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri as an anti-Semite. \u201cIn which @HawleyMO calls a Jewish journalist a \u2018smug, rich liberal elitist,\u2019\u201d Tapper said in a tweet that went out to 2 million followers. Tapper is one of the few CNN journalists I respect. If even he is caught up in silly partisan hackery it\u2019s a very bad sign. Hawley had not said or implied anything remotely anti-Semitic, and this was a cheap shot, totally unbecoming of anyone who hopes to be seen as a nonpartisan reporter. It\u2019s Breitbart-ish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes Breitbart occasionally report things that turn out not to be true? Yes, on very rare occasions. But so does CNN. It reported in August that the CIA had recalled a top spy from Russia because President Trump had \u201crepeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source.\u201d The New York Times clarified that the decision to extract the spy was made in \u201clate 2016\u201d \u2014 during the Obama administration. CNN falsely reported in 2017 that Anthony Scaramucci was being investigated by Congress for ties to a Russian investment fund. CNN falsely reported that Donald Trump Jr. was tipped off in advance about the Russia-backed DNC Wikileaks dump of 2016, when in fact he was told about it after the dump. CNN repeatedly bends facts to exaggerate the prevalence of school shootings. In the service of its anti-gun crusade, which has the feel of Breitbart\u2019s anti-immigration campaign, Don Lemon said, \u201cI was able to go and buy an automatic weapon. . . . Most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon.\u201d No, he didn\u2019t. No, they can\u2019t.\n\nLike Breitbart, CNN revels in being petty and making something out of nothing, as it did when it misleadingly edited a video to make it appear that Trump had committed a faux pas by dumping the remains of a box of fish food into a koi pond in Japan. CNN omitted the part of the video that showed Japan\u2019s prime minister had done so first, indicating that Trump was merely following suit. The way CNN obsessively snipes at its rivals at Fox News Channel is pure Breitbart-ism. Stelter rails against FNC with such lunatic energy that he is in effect CNN\u2019s Chief Fox News Correspondent. Major news organizations used to consider such naked, bitter jealousy to be beneath them, but alas David Brinkley is gone.\n\nCNN entertained a panelist \u2014 on Stelter\u2019s show, called \u201cReliable Sources,\u201d no less \u2014 who said President Trump \u201cis as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were.\u201d Anderson Cooper Breitbart-ishly characterized tea-party members as conducting a \u201cWar on Obama\u201d and derided them as engaging in \u201ctea bagging,\u201d which is not only partisan and nasty but actually obscene. Cooper descends to schoolyard mockery when \u201creporting\u201d on Trump-adjacent figures in a way he didn\u2019t for Obama appointees. It is simply not possible that Cooper can look in the mirror and see a judicious, evenhanded, nonpartisan reporter when he does this kind of thing:\n\nAnd tonight, we commend the bravery of White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who finally got a brief furlough from West Wing Witness Protection. Grisham popped her head out this morning to check in with her supervisors over at Fox News. Though, it seems like she saw her shadow and [is] now back under ground for six more weeks of stonewalling. . . . Ooh, Stephanie. You got to increase your vocabulary, I mean, your criticism. \u201cTheater\u201d now has been used twice. I mean, Grisham clearly doesn\u2019t get to Broadway enough if she, you know, thinks those press conferences are theater.\n\nJournalism? No, this is just tedious, witless, predictable, undisguised oppositionism. Obama could do no right with Breitbart just as Trump can do no right with CNN.
