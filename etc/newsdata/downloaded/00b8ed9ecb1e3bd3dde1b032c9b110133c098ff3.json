But what\u2019s the difference? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nThe media want a repeat of the 2016 ratings Trump's nastiness generated. But this is a fight for democracy, not a game of limbo. Stop lowering the bar.\n\nObviously, I watched. Like every other American with a conscience \u2014 a demographic I pray is growing, not shrinking \u2014 I want to carefully consider my other options for the presidency alongside the context of what is clearly at stake.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m obviously a political nerd, I\u2019m not alone: The most recent Democratic debate, hosted by Univision and ABC News, drew over 14 million viewers, and the other Democratic debates have fared well, too. Polling evidence suggests that Democratic voters are engaged just as much if not more in this election than in previous cycles. In other words, whatever you think of the vetting process for the debate or the overall state of the Democratic Party or the crisis facing our democracy as a whole, at least within the bubble of this small window on the primary process so far, we, the people, seem to be paying attention.\n\nFaster, dumber, meaner\n\nWhat are we getting in return? More of the faster, dumber, meaner media that got us into this crisis in the first place. If we\u2019re going to fix what ails our democracy, we need to fix the Democratic primary debates.\n\nIn the run-up to 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept their debates fairly civil and focused on policy issues. And the debate hosts, being serious people used to discussing serious issues in serious ways, went along with that \u2014 asking substantive questions to elicit meaningful differences on policy.\n\nThat was also the news media\u2019s main approach to the Republican primaries, at first. But then Donald Trump changed the game. He batted away policy questions with personal smears, and the resulting dust-ups not only trended on Twitter but also fell like catnip at the feet of a news media desperate to prove its enduring relevance and all too aware that pettiness generates more clicks than policy. By the end of the primary process, cable networks were streaming footage of empty stages awaiting Trump\u2019s presence, even on primary nights where he mostly lost. Because, for the news media, Trump meant winning ratings either way.\n\nDemocratic debate in Houston: From A to F, Mastio & Lawrence grade candidates\n\nWhich is how we had a dynamic where, for instance, Clinton\u2019s email scandals received far more coverage in mainstream news outlets online than all of Trump\u2019s scandals combined, and more than twice as much coverage as her policy positions. Coverage about Clinton was disproportionately focused on said \u201cscandals\u201d as compared with Trump, whose media coverage was predominantly focused on his policy proposals.\n\nAnd over the course of the campaign, another study found, Clinton was covered more negatively than Trump. As one serial sexual harasser masquerading as a (now former) TV network executive once famously suggested, maybe Trump was bad for America but he was damn good for the media. And in turn, it appears, the media was damn good to Trump.\n\nDemocratic presidential debate hosted by ABC News in Houston on Sept. 12, 2019. (Photo: David J. Phillip/AP)\n\nFast-forward and we can see the same media institutions still high off not only Trump\u2019s campaign performance but also every single one of his attention-grabbing tweets, clearly looking for a fix from the Democratic primary contest \u2014 and contorting the debates to try to create one.\n\nFor instance: \"Who on this stage is making promises just to get elected?\" CNN's Jake Tapper asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota in the second Democratic debate, throwing her own words back at her.\n\nStaying with Klobuchar, ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in the third debate asked, \u201cWho represents the extreme on this stage?\u201d Klobuchar tried to redirect the question without smearing her fellow Democrats. But Stephanopoulos interrupted her and pressed, \u201cWhich ones?\u201d\n\nThese kinds of prods pockmarked the debates, with the candidates thankfully largely refusing to take the bait and even criticizing the networks or the media writ large for their attempt to turn substantive disagreements into snipe-y mudslinging. Perhaps following Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s profound gravitational pull, the Democratic candidates have managed to keep the primary focused on policy. And they\u2019ve consistently emphasized that their agreements far outweigh their disagreements. The candidates, like the voters, want party unity and civility \u2014 the media a food fight.\n\nDon't fret about 'electability': Celebrate the diverse 2020 Democratic candidates\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying that when you wrestle with a pig, sooner or later you realize the pig likes it. It\u2019s impossible to know who the bigger swine is in our current climate \u2014 Donald Trump or the news media. Perhaps the pig tail is wagging the pig. But on the other side stand the American people desperate for clear-eyed leadership and serious, meaningful change and a fleet of Democratic candidates ready to give it to them. Here\u2019s a crazy idea: Why don\u2019t we make the debates about that?\n\nThe news media can do better\n\nIn particular, there are three things the next debates should do differently.\n\n\u25baDon\u2019t mistake conflict for contrast. Yes, we want to hear how the candidates\u2019 views differ. That\u2019s not the same thing as candidates attacking each other. Ask questions that get into the nuances of policy disagreements, versus trying to goad the candidates into needling each other as entertainment. That might actually lead to the kinds of discussions that not only inform voters but also go down in the history books as shoring up and smartening up our democracy. Even if they don\u2019t trend on Twitter.\n\nAs a corollary, stop that stupid rule where if one candidate name-checks another, the named candidate gets to respond. Again, this only seems designed literally to incentivize personal attacks.\n\n\u25baFocus on more than a couple of issues. Yes, health care and immigration are vital, and polls show they\u2019re at the top of voters' minds. But that\u2019s not all voters care about, nor are they the only issues on which a potential president must lead \u2014 and where it\u2019s important to elucidate the differences among these primary contenders. Affordable housing, foreign aid, abortion rights, the creeping privatization of public education, strengthening our social safety net, tax policy, monopoly power, and technology and privacy rights \u2014 voters also care about these issues. Ask about them, alongside questions about impeachment.\n\n\u25baGive the contenders more time to speak. The Wrap's J. Clara Chan asked debate coaches how they would improve the debates, and their number one demand was to lengthen response times. Short response times facilitate quippy, soundbite-y answers. Although I realize nuance is dead and the news media helped kill it, it would be nice to actually give people arguing that they are knowledgeable and thoughtful enough to be the leader of the free world more than a few seconds to demonstrate that.\n\nWe can do better. Our country can do better. And yes, the news media can do better. This is a fight for the future of our democracy, not a game of limbo. We need to stop lowering the bar.\n\nSally Kohn is author of \"The Opposite Of Hate: A Field Guide To Repairing Our Humanity.\" You can find her online at sallykohn.com and on Twitter: @SallyKohn\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
