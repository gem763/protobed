Roy is a classic tortured hero, with a face that makes an unbeatable argument for the proliferation of the human species and a mind so troubled and opaque that we must spend two hours drilling into it. Roy (I\u2019m still not over \u201cRoy,\u201d but I guess I have to keep typing it like it\u2019s normal), who has been deeply damaged by his absentee dad, proudly admits that he doesn\u2019t rely on anyone and doesn\u2019t need anything from his fellow human beings. In fact, he hides from everyone: his fellow astronauts, his family, himself. Most of all, he hides from his wife, a woman named Eve played by Liv Tyler.\n\nLiv Tyler in Ad Astra. Photo: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nEve appears almost exclusively via flashback \u2014 giggling beneath covers or staring stonily at her emotionally remote husband from across a room. Sometimes she pops up in the back of blurry frames, looking disappointed. Once in a while, she appears in little video messages that Roy replays on his phone when he\u2019s feeling guilty. In his review at The Atlantic, David Sims generously refers to the role of Eve as \u201clargely undercooked.\u201d I would describe the role as what happens before you cook something, when it is merely an idea in your mind and you haven\u2019t even bought the ingredients yet, and then you get tired and don\u2019t really want to go to the store, so you stay home and order Seamless, and that Seamless is really bad, but you eat it anyway.\n\nEve has, liberally, five lines. Some of them are unintelligible, barely making it through the damaged goop of Roy\u2019s mind. Only one line, which she speaks aloud during her video message, is memorable: \u201cI have my own life,\u201d she tells Roy. \u201cI\u2019m my own person. I can\u2019t just wait for you.\u201d It is through this line that we understand that Eve has left Roy and is not just a Sad, Dead Movie Wife. Eve doesn\u2019t have any other similarly explanatory lines in the film, and therefore, we have no idea what\u2019s going on with her. What does Eve do for a living? What does Eve want from life? Does Eve have any allergies to medication? I don\u2019t know! Meanwhile, Ad Astra dedicates several scenes to the resting heart rate of Roy, who spends the duration of the movie punching monkeys and taking illegal rocket-ship rides.\n\nThis is not, in any way, a knock on Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler is a goddess \u2014 perhaps, as my colleague Madeleine Aggeler has recently posited, the creator herself. I\u2019m sure she had her reasons for starring as Flashback Space Wife, and I\u2019m positive that if she were given even a fraction of Brad\u2019s onscreen time she would have been able to create a rich internal life for Eve. But watching Ad Astra, I was reminded of another wild misuse of Liv Tyler, in a quiet little indie film from 1998 called Armageddon.\n\nLiv Tyler in Armageddon. Photo: Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nI\u2019m kidding, of course; Armageddon is a movie wherein gigantic grown men wax poetic about the beauty of drilling massive holes into the Earth and say things like, \u201cLet\u2019s chew this iron bitch up.\u201d At one point, during what\u2019s meant to be a tear-jerking speech, Bruce Willis says, \u201cI\u2019ve been drilling holes in the Earth for 30 years, and I\u2019ve never missed a depth I was aiming for.\u201d Nobody laughs. Later, during a pivotal scene that involves several deep-core drillers wildly pounding their way into an asteroid, one yells, \u201cI\u2019m pushing through her! I\u2019m pushing through her!\u201d Anyway, Liv Tyler is also in this movie. She plays Bruce Willis\u2019s daughter, Grace, who was raised on an oil rig and is now, much to Bruce Willis\u2019s chagrin, engaged to one of his younger co-workers, played by a distressingly sharp-cheekboned Ben Affleck.\n\nLiv gets a few good scenes in Armageddon, but throughout most of Michael Bay\u2019s hypermasculine urtext, Liv Tyler is pacing and crying. (Occasionally, she also stands meaningfully in front of an American flag.) She paces while her dad and boyfriend are sent to space to save the world from a massive asteroid. She cries while her boyfriend goes missing for a few hours. She paces while her dad decides he will blow himself up inside the asteroid because the nuclear bomb\u2019s little button broke. She cries when she learns the mission was successful.\n\nPhoto: Buena Vista Pictures\n\nAt one point, Liv is allowed to do one more thing: She lies in the grass while Ben Affleck makes little animal crackers dance around on her boobs. What I am trying to tell you is that in Armageddon, Liv Tyler has to put up with Ben Affleck getting crackers all over her boobs. She has to witness the violent death of her father while everyone around her cheers. She has to stay inside a NASA control center for several days in the same dress. She does not get to shower. And despite being just as qualified as the oil drillers she grew up around, she does not even get to go to space!\n\nAt one point, one of the NASA employees says to Liv Tyler, \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d She looks at him, furious. \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere else to go!\u201d she says.\n\nI have a suggestion for where else she could go: space. Why won\u2019t anybody let Liv Tyler go to space??? (Okay, sure, in 2014, she was in a little-seen 1970s-era farce about a space station, but this doesn\u2019t count, because nobody saw it.) I want to see Liv Tyler in a serious space movie where her ambitions are given as much weight as men named Roy. I want Liv Tyler to drill through an asteroid with a phalluslike instrument and zero sense of irony. I want Liv Tyler to pull out a machine gun in space and have people say, \u201cOh, man. What are you doing with a gun in space?\u201d I want Liv Tyler to say, with the gravity of a lunatic medieval king, \u201cBring out the Judge.\u201d I want Liv Tyler to override the override. I want Liv Tyler on a dune buggy, recklessly cannonballing herself across asteroid caverns. I want Liv Tyler to openly despise her young son\u2019s \u201croughneck\u201d girlfriend, but then, during her final moments, say, \u201cI love you! You were always like a daughter to me.\u201d\n\nInstead of a NASA employee turning to Liv Tyler after her boyfriend, Ben Affleck, saves the world and saying, \u201cYour boyfriend\u2019s back,\u201d I want someone to turn to Ben Affleck, whose girlfriend, Liv Tyler, just saved the world, and say, \u201cYour girlfriend is back.\u201d And then I want Liv Tyler to crumble thousands of animal crackers all over Ben Affleck, just so he knows how it feels.\n\nIn Ad Astra, Liv Tyler\u2019s Eve shows up once more, near the end of the film. You get the sense \u2014 and only the sense, because, again, she does not speak! \u2014 that she\u2019s going to forgive Roy for ignoring her and then leaving her on Earth for a really long time to go chasing after his daddy. It is the most disappointing part of the movie. I\u2019d hoped instead that Ad Astra would reveal to us that Eve didn\u2019t sit quietly in her suburban home, but instead chased Roy to space, followed him all the way to Neptune. I\u2019d hoped that Ad Astra would reveal that just as Roy barreled down toward Neptune, he turned around and saw Eve behind him, laughing maniacally. Eve, hair billowing majestically inside of her space suit, sat proudly on top of a thousand-pound drill (a drill was not required in the film and the mechanics of this are complicated, but bear with me). She looked Roy directly in the face (through their helmets, of course) and smiled, revving the drill like a motorbike. \u201cLet\u2019s chew this iron bitch up,\u201d she said.", "description": "In \u201cAd Astra\u201d and \u201cArmageddon,\u201d Liv Tyler plays the woman left behind while men save the world.
