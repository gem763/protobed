That meeting he says canceled at the last minute. Significant developments here. David Wright starts us off with the latest from the white house. David, good morning. Reporter: Good morning, guys. Secret peace talks with the Taliban at camp David would have been a dramatic bit of diplomacy, almost unthinkable, potentially game changing, but it was not to be. Overnight the president trump tweeted unbeknown to everyone the major Taliban leaders and separately the president of Afghanistan were going to secretly meet with me at camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the united States tonight. What put off the meeting was the tam ban's admission that it was responsible Thursday for a suicide bombing in kabul. That bombing killed one U.S. Soldier and 11 others. Trump said he immediately canceled the peace talks asking what kind of people would kill so many in order to strengthen their bargaining position. Adding how many more decades are they willing to fight. David, another reason this is so surprising, years ago Donald Trump was very critical of then president Obama over possible talks with the Taliban. Reporter: Right you are, whit. In the past trump was sharply criticizing Obama. In one tweet he criticized him for negotiating with our sworn enemy, the Taliban, who facilitated 9/11. As president, trump has also expressed his hope many times of ending America's longest war. There are now more U.S. Troops in Afghanistan than there were when trump took office, about 14,000 or so. About a third would have come home within months of signing a peace agreement. Now their fate is in limbo. Many national security people have cautioned against too quick a draw down saying it could Crea an opening for Al Qaeda.
