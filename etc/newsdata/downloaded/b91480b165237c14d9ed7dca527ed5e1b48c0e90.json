Murrow is reputed to have said, they have no skins. Reporters are so sensitive that you needn\u2019t criticize their work to earn a buzz saw in the face in return. Just offer the observation, \u201cI saw your piece,\u201d and frown. They\u2019ll be on you with tooth and claw in a millisecond, demanding to know what you\u2019re implying.\n\nAnd of all the thin-skinned beasts prowling the journalistic forest, few have a thinner epidermis than the boys and girls who work at the New York Times. On Monday, the Times\u2019 immune system was activated to produce a Page One story to retaliate against pro-Trump activist Arthur Schwartz, an intimate of Donald Trump Jr. Schwartz, the Times reports, is part of a network of pro-Trumpies who have been digging for embarrassing dirt on journalists who work for Trump-critical media\u2014CNN, the Washington Post, and, of course, the New York Times. According to the Times, the network shares its embarrassing discoveries\u2014call them oppo research, if you\u2019d like\u2014with conservative political operations and then stands by to enjoy the drama.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs much as I would like to sympathize with my fellow journalists, it doesn\u2019t strike me as unreasonable to ask them to own or repudiate vile or impolitic things they might have stated in the past. Nor is it remotely unfair for the president\u2019s supporters to demand that journalists, who are forever denouncing him as a racist (because he is), be held accountable for their bigoted speech, on Twitter or anywhere else. Journalists don\u2019t deserve a get-out-of-bigotry-jail free card just because they\u2019re journalists. If their past tweets, however ancient, undercut their current journalistic work or make them sound hypocritical, they can\u2019t blame their diminished prestige on Trump\u2019s allies. It\u2019s like blaming a cop for writing you a ticket for speeding in a school zone.\n\nThe Trumpies\u2019 investigations bore small fruit last week when Breitbart published a story branding Tom Wright-Piersanti, an editor on the Times politics desk, an anti-Semite. His offenses including some ancient tweets (now deleted) he wrote during his college years that mocked Jews. In one tweet dated Jan. 1, 2010, Wright-Piersanti wrote, \u201cI was going to \u2018Crappy Jew Year,\u2019 but one of my resolutions is to be less anti-Semitic.\u201d In another, dated Dec. 16, 2009, he wrote, \u201cWho called the Jew-police?\u201d next to a photo of a Menorah.\n\nSchwartz also called attention to offensive but old tweets posted by former CNN photojournalist Mohammed Elshamy, CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins and Washington Post reporter Josh Dawsey. [Update: The language of Dawsey's allegedly offensive tweet was ironic, as this news story illustrates.] But according to the Times, this marks only the beginning of the pro-Trump campaign against the press. The goal is to unleash a dossier of embarrassing social media posts and public statements by journalists that will \u201cdiscredit news organizations deemed hostile to President Trump\u201d and \u201cundercut the influence of legitimate news reporting.\u201d\n\nTimes Publisher A.G. Sulzberger did himself, his paper and his staff no favor by issuing a public memo to his staff decrying what he called an unprecedented \u201ccoordinated campaign \u2026 to attack hundreds of journalists in retaliation for coverage of the administration.\u201d Sulzberger wrote: \u201cThis represents an escalation of an ongoing campaign against the free press.\u201d\n\nHe can\u2019t have read his own paper\u2019s story about the network very closely. \u201cThe liberal group Media Matters for America helped pioneer close scrutiny of public statements by conservative media personalities,\u201d Times reporters Kenneth P. Vogel and Jeremy W. Peters report.\n\nAnd long before Media Matters was born, Reed Irvine\u2019s Accuracy in Media was excavating potentially damaging comments for evidence of liberal bias. Founded in 1969, AIM bird-dogged CBS News, the Washington Post, the New York Times and other mainstream outlets. So encompassing was the AIM net that it attempted to snag me, a lowly freelancer, in the mid-\u201980s. One of Irvine\u2019s legmen noted and then publicized some friendly comments I made before the marijuana legalization group NORML. The legman thought he\u2019d scored some sort of gotcha. The only problem with AIM\u2019s expos\u00e9 was that I had supported\u2014on the record\u2014legalizing drugs for years.\n\nSulzberger tempered his protest toward the end of his memo by writing, \u201cBut I also want to be clear: No organization is above scrutiny, including the Times.\u201d But that\u2019s an example of wanting to have it both ways. If the press is not above scrutiny, it shouldn\u2019t bellyache when truth-squaded\u2014even if the best dirt the truth-squaders can surface is encrusted in dust and mold.\n\nDeep scrutiny of the press\u2014even when performed by bad faith actors like Arthur Schwartz and his ilk\u2014is a boon, not a bane. The embarrassments unearthed by Schwartz and company will bruise the tender egos who run the Times, the Post and CNN. But in the long run, these minirevelations will help them maintain the professional standards they\u2019re always crowing about. Instead of damning its critics for going through its staffs\u2019 social media history with tweezers, the Times and A.G. Sulzberger should send them a thank you card.\n\n******\n\nWhen will the tweezers fall on me? Send dirt on me via mail to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.
