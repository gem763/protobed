In between snapping photos of the building and peeking through the dusty windows, Walz told the governor about his great-great-grandfather's role in the group that first brought electric power to the town.\n\n\"Every Monday night we would have a movie night, and what was it, a dime to get in?\" Walz asked while turning to Smith, his sister, for confirmation. \"A dime, I think,\" Smith recalled, \"and I think popcorn was a nickel.\"\n\nSmith, who caught up with Bullock in Iowa City at a campaign stop earlier this month, told the governor about the time she met his father. The two tried piece together a puzzling timeline and concluded the meeting would have likely taken place in the early 1960s, when Bullock's newlywed parents traveled to Salem, Iowa.\n\n\"Pretty amazing,\" Bullock said, smiling. Walz then jumped in to inform the governor his great, great, grandmother had been a \"die-hard Democrat.\"\n\n\"Is that right?\" Bullock said, before adding, \"Hopefully she is looking down. She is going to help me out on this ride.\"", "description": "The Montana governor and presidential candidate took the \"oldest road in Iowa\" to the house where his great-great-grandfather lived and took in some of the family lore from second cousins in Lowell, Iowa", "authors": ["Musadiq Bidar"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/19/8650ab5e-da69-4616-963a-2307c01c03f7/thumbnail/1200x630g2/06937ad270b529b6661d957d876fc95f/bullock.png"}
