His former ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, warned that his decision meant leaving US allies in the region \"to die\".\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's going on in northern Syria:\n\nWho are Syria's Kurds?\n\nKurdish forces have been a crucial ally of the US and its partners in the fight against IS in the area.\n\nThe US-backed force that controls the region, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), is led by the Kurdish YPG militia.\n\nKurdish forces got a foothold in the north of Syria early in the civil war, while Assad's government forces focused on fighting the IS elsewhere in the country.\n\nTheir control was concentrated in three predominantly Kurdish regions \u2014 home to roughly 2 million Kurds \u2014 and their influence widened with the defeat of IS.\n\nKurdish leaders say their aim is regional autonomy within a decentralized Syria, not independence.\n\nRead more: Turkey ready for military operation in Syria after Trump pulls troops\n\nWhy is Turkey worried?\n\nTurkey says the YPG is indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been classed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US and the EU.\n\nThe PKK has been waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey for 34 years as it fights for an independent or autonomous Kurdish state.\n\nKurds account for 15% to 20% of Turkey's population and live mostly in eastern and southeastern areas bordering Syria. Wary of separatism, Turkey views the Syrian foothold of the YPG as a national security threat.\n\nIt wants to drive the YPG away from its border and create a space inside Syria where 2 million Syrian refugees currently hosted in Turkey can be settled.\n\nTurkey and the US have long been at odds over Syria, but the NATO allies agreed in August to set up a zone in northeast Syria along the border with Turkey.\n\nTurkey has accused the US of moving too slowly to create the zone and they have in disagreement over how far it should extend into Syria and who should control it.\n\nAnkara wants it to stretch 30km inside Syria and to be cleared of YPG fighters. It has repeatedly warned about launching an offensive on its own into northeast Syria, where US forces are stationed alongside the SDF.\n\nTurkey has not revealed the scope of the initial military operation, with an official telling Reuters: \u201cThe location, time and scope for implementing the measures against security risks will once again be decided by Turkey.\"\n\nWhat were US troops doing in the region?\n\nUS troops were in Syria to help in the fight against IS and to help their allies ensure the group didn't return.\n\nThey were also acting as a buffer between Turkey and the Kurdish forces that Turkey wants to drive away from its border.\n\nTrump has long called for the return of US troops from Syria.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Kurds?\n\nDespite Trump's warning to Turkey not to do anything he considers \"off-limits\", it's unclear exactly what he would consider unacceptable.\n\nTrump sent the following tweets following outcry from politicians in the US, including some within his own Republican party.\n\nThe Kurds and their allies were able to set up their own governing bodies as they gained a foothold in north-east Syria, while always insisting their aim is autonomy, not independence.\n\nThe SDF said it wanted stability but vowed to respond to any attack. \u201cWe will not hesitate to turn any unprovoked attack by Turkey into an all-out war on the entire border to defend ourselves and our people,\u201d SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said.\n\nWhat happens in the longer term depends on whether the US keeps a military presence in other parts of the northeast and east.\n\nA full withdrawal could expose the area to the risk of more Turkish advances, an IS revival, or attempts by Iranian- and Russian-backed government forces to gain ground.", "description": "Here's why Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw 50 US special forces troops from northern Syria could have huge geopolitical ramifications.", "authors": ["Luke Hurst"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/63/56/1000x563_cmsv2_b73748e0-0670-5c80-819a-d2e996434133-4216356.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
