She said:\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson has already driven a bulldozer through the constitution, so no longer are ideas like impeachment far-fetched. I will tell other opposition party leaders, we need to be ready to impeach Boris Johnson if he breaks the law.\n\nIn 2004, Boris Johnson supported an attempt to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq war, co-signing a motion tabled by current Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price.\n\nWriting in a column for The Telegraph at the time, Johnson said that Blair deserved to be impeached because he had \u201ctreated parliament and the public with contempt\u201d. Saville Roberts said:\n\nImpeachment was a process backed by Boris Johnson not so long ago. A man sacked for serially lying backed the impeachment of Blair for the same reason \u2013 lying. If the prime minister becomes a law-breaker, we have an even stronger case for impeachment than the very cause he advocated back in 2004.\n\nA spokesman for Plaid Cymru said the party\u2019s priority was to deliver a people\u2019s vote, not a general election, and that they would vote against any motion of no confidence. \u201cParliament must be sitting whilst the extension [to article 50] is secured, which means beyond the European council meeting scheduled between the 14th to the 19th October,\u201d he said.", "description": "Rolling coverage including supreme court ruling on Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament and Labour conference in Brighton", "authors": ["Andrew Sparrow", "Frances Perraudin", "Peter Walker", "Severin Carrell", "Rajeev Syal", "Martin Kettle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30288c101617da98c1d0db99ad6b219f1416aa1e/0_54_2824_1694/master/2824.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04a083bcd94dbdc5a62b2a93bc5e6b86", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
