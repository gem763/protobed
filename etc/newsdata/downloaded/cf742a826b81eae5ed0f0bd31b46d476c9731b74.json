You can't be 2-0 up at home to palace and draw. Emery I've backed you but bro, enough is enough. Xhaka can f*ck himself as well. Never wanna see him in an arsenal top again! #AFC #EmiratesStadium #TimesUp\".\n\nLacazette set up Arsenal's second goal by flicking on a corner into the path of David Luiz, but other than that he was ineffective during the match, and appeared frustrated at the full-time whistle as the Gunners dropped further points in their battle to finish in the Champions League qualification spots.\n\nAfter the game Emery admitted Xhaka had reacted in the wrong manner, and said he would deal with the midfielder privately.\n\n\"He's wrong but we are going to speak inside about that situation,\" said Emery. \"I want to be calm but, really, he was wrong in this action.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"We are working with every player about how to deal with the pressure. The reaction was wrong and we will discuss it with him.\"\n\nThings do not get any easier for Arsenal, as they face league leaders Liverpool in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.", "description": "The comment was posted by notorious AFCTV personality Troopz following Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace at the Emirates", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20739674.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Arsenal-v-Crystal-Palace.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
