USA TODAY\n\nWith coach Ralph Krueger\u2019s Buffalo Sabres (6-1-1) leading the Atlantic Division and Dave Tippett\u2019s Edmonton Oilers sitting atop the Pacific Division, offseason coaching changes are an important storyline in the NHL\u2019s early going.\n\nBut this is an old story, not a fresh approach\n\nLast year, new coach Rod Brind\u2019Amour took the Carolina Hurricanes to their first playoff appearance in a decade and made it to the Eastern Conference Final before bowing out. Coach Craig Berube, an in-season coaching arrival, guided the St. Louis Blues to the first Stanley Cup in franchise history.\n\n\u201cWhen you bring in a new coach, I truly believe you get the best from all guys,\u201d Hurricanes general manager Don Waddell said. \u201cAs a player, you get a chance to showcase what you are all about.\u201d\n\nHistorically, coaching changes often give NHL teams an initial boost, whether it is at the start of a season or in-season. In 2015-16, the Penguins fired Mike Johnston after 28 games and Mike Sullivan took them to a championship. That was six years after coach Dan Bylsma took over in-season for the Penguins and won the 2009 Stanley Cup.\n\nVeteran coach Darryl Sutter took over the Los Angeles Kings in 2011-12 and won a Stanley Cup. Before his arrival, the Kings last won a playoff series in 2001.\n\n\u201cI see in other sports (a coaching move) is not as big of a change,\u201d Waddell said. \u201cBut I see in our sport, because we do roll 18 players on nightly basis, where a guy feels it\u2019s a fresh start and an opportunity to prove he deserves more ice time.\u201d\n\nBuffalo Sabres captain Jack Eichel talks with head coach Ralph Krueger during the first period of a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins.

In life, everyone always tries harder to impress the new boss.\n\nPlus, new coaches often concentrate on improving the team\u2019s defensive play because that\u2019s the area where they can have instant impact. You can teach a player to be more defensive but you can\u2019t transform a 20-goal scorer into a 40-goal scorer. Defensive improvement always impact the standings.\n\nTeams that made off-season coaching switches:\n\n\u25baSabres (Krueger): No one in Buffalo is too excited about the team\u2019s strong start because everyone remembers last season\u2019s collapse after winning 10 in a row.\n\nBut Krueger\u2019s professorial style fits well with this team, which relies heavily on young stars Jack Eichel, Rasmus Dahlin and Sam Reinhart.\n\nCanadian Krueger, the son of German immigrants, previously coached the Edmonton Oilers. But he was recently chairman of the Southampton soccer club and a well-respected motivational speaker. He once wrote a book, in German, called \"Team Life: Beyond Setbacks to Success.\"\n\n\u201cAt heart, he\u2019s a kid from Manitoba who loves coaching hockey,\u201d said Sabres general manager Jason Botterill. \u201cHe enjoyed his experience at Southampton, but he is fired up and excited to be back behind the bench. Our players are feeding off that. They understand the passion he\u2019s bringing.\u201d\n\nKrueger, well-accomplished in international hockey, has always had the ability to instantly connect with players he coached. Botterill said he senses that Krueger always knows what to say in every situation.\n\n\u201cWhen you sit down with Ralph, his entire focus is on you,\u201d Botterill said. \u201cYou feel he\u2019s gone through a lot of experiences and he\u2019s pulled down a lot of knowledge from those experiences.\u201d\n\n(Story continues below gallery)\n\n\u25baOilers (Tippett): With GM Ken Holland also in place, the Oilers seem to have a fresh, upbeat attitude. Tippett will make this team better defensively. Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl can do the rest.\n\n\u25baAnaheim Ducks (Dallas Eakins): It\u2019s not just goalie John Gibson getting it done, although he has been a big part of their strong start. Eakins has the team playing more up-tempo than they have in the past. Players seem to be buying what he\u2019s selling.\n\n\u25baPhiladelphia Flyers (Alain Vigneault): Vigneault has a long history of success at the NHL level, but will be judged by his ability to transform the Flyers into a consistent playoff team. Too early to determine what his impact will be.\n\n\u25ba Florida Panthers (Joel Quenneville): Quenneville's impact is expected to be significant. However, the Panthers have been sluggish out of the gate. Players may need time to adjust to Quenneville, who won three Stanley Cups in Chicago. Sergei Bobrovsky\u2019s .870 save percentage hasn\u2019t helped.\n\n\u25baOttawa Senators (D.J. Smith): The Senators are expected to be the NHL\u2019s worst team and there\u2019s not much Smith can do about that. But they seem improved.\n\n\u25baLos Angeles Kings (Todd McLellan): McLellan is a respected coach, but the Kings management may be looking to the future, not this season. They may be looking forward to another top-five draft pick.\n\nFollow Allen on Twitter @ByKevinAllen.", "description": "The Buffalo Sabres, Edmonton Oilers and Anaheim Ducks all made coaching changes and all have had success in the early going of the NHL season.", "authors": ["Kevin Allen", "Published A.M.
