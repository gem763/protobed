In the spread, Meghan\u2019s friends said that he\u2019d never attempted to make amends or reach out.\n\n\u201cI decided to release parts of the letter because of the article from Meghan\u2019s friends in People magazine. I have to defend myself. I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful,\u201d Thomas told the Mail on Sunday over the weekend. \u201cThe letter didn\u2019t seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letter was presented in a way that vilified me and wasn\u2019t true,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was presented as her reaching out and writing a loving letter in the hope of healing the rift, but the letter isn\u2019t like that at all.\u201d\n\nThomas, who told the Mail that he\u2019d repeatedly tried to reach out to his daughter after the royal wedding in May 2018, said he\u2019d hoped the letter would be an \u201colive branch\u201d and a \u201cpathway to reconciliation.\u201d\n\nGetty/\"Good Morning Britain\" Meghan Markle and her father, Thomas Markle, have reportedly not spoken since the day after her wedding.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recognize the person who wrote the letter but I still love my daughter. All it would take is one phone call and most of this craziness would stop,\u201d he said.\n\nMeghan is now pursuing legal action against Associated Newspapers, the parent company of the Mail on Sunday and Daily Mail, for publishing the private letter. Prince Harry announced Meghan\u2019s suit with a fiery statement about the British press\u2019 \u201cruthless campaign\u201d against her and their treatment of his wife.\n\nHe also slammed Associated Newspapers for only publishing part of the private letter in an attempt to \u201cmanipulate\u201d readers.\n\n\u201cIn addition to their unlawful publication of this private document, they purposely misled you by strategically omitting select paragraphs, specific sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year,\u201d he said in a letter published on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s website.\n\nPOOL/Reuters Both the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are currently involved in lawsuits with the media.\n\nKensington and Buckingham Palace have never directly responded to any of Thomas Markle\u2019s claims or statements. Meghan\u2019s father has never met Prince Harry and reportedly hasn\u2019t spoken to his daughter and her husband since the day after their wedding last year. He has also never met his grandson, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. Though Thomas was invited to the royal wedding and was initially supposed to walk Meghan down the aisle, he later pulled out of the ceremony after it was revealed he conspired with paparazzi to produce staged photos for money. He later said that he pulled out of the wedding for health issues.
