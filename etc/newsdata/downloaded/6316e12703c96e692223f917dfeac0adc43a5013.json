It is both of these teams' second game of the tournament, with the winner set to improve their qualification hopes significantly.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhen is it?\n\nSaturday, September 28. It will be played at the Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa in the Shizuoka prefecture.\n\nWhat time is kick-off?\n\nKick-off is at 8.15am BST, 4.15pm in Japan.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nAll Rugby World Cup games are being broadcast live on ITV, with replays and a live stream available on the ITV Hub. Alternatively, you can follow all the action here with Telegraph Sport.\n\nWhat is the latest squad news?\n\nJapan\n\nNo 8 Amanaki Lelei Mafi is set to return from injury and, when you throw in the form of Pieter Labuschagne and Kazuki Himeno in the Cherry Blossoms' win over Russia in their Pool A opener, it might mean that captain Michael Leitch could start Saturday's game at Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa on the bench.\n\nElsewhere, Japan are set to neutralise Ireland's high-ball threat by handing the full-back starting jersey to Ryohei Yamanaka.\n\nStar wing Kenki Fukuoka trained with the side this week but is unlikely to feature as he continues his rehab on an ankle injury.\n\nIreland\n\nHead coach Joe Schmidt has said that he intends to make changes to his team to face Japan on Saturday. And, after an 80-minute shift on Saturday, captain Rory Best is one of the names likely to be rested.\n\nRobbie Henshaw remains highly unlikely to face the hosts in Shizuoka, but Keith Earls, Joey Carbery and Rob Kearney have all trained this week, while Peter O'Mahony and Bundee Aki will be hopeful of coming through their concussion protocols in time to be considered for selection.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohnny Sexton suffered a bang to the thigh but he will be fine, while Tadhg Furlong's substitution was tactical. Both men should be fit for this weekend.\n\nWhat is their head-to-head record?\n\nIreland and Japan have played each other on seven occasions and Ireland have won all seven matches. They have met twice in the Rugby World Cup, in 1991 and 1995, but never in the professional era\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\nIreland head coach Joe Schmidt:\n\nWe\u2019ve just got to go step by step. We won\u2019t be talking too much about (a potential quarterfinal match-up with) South Africa. If we can maybe get past Japan, we\u2019ve got Russia, Samoa, and hopefully at that stage we can potentially manage players. Watching Japan - that first half they played against England, and they went through the Pacific Nations Cup unbeaten - they are a dangerous team. If they get some tempo, we might be on the back foot. I think the Japanese will play very fast. They have great skills and players who can spread the ball very quickly (and) up front you\u2019ve got some really dynamic guys. I\u2019m not sure how Jamie [Joseph] will manage those, but we\u2019ll be watching with interest on Thursday when he names his team.\n\nJapan captain Michael Leitch:\n\nI presume (Ireland will) do to us pretty much the same thing, teams are kicking the ball to nullify our strength. What we make out of the balls given to us will be the key. (Ireland) are very strong, a team that doesn\u2019t make lots of mistakes. There are many players to watch out for. The things we have to be most careful with are scrums, mauls and lineouts and we need to carry them out with high accuracy or risk not getting the rhythm of the game.\n\nWhat are the best betting odds?\n\nJapan to win: 9/1\n\nDraw: 66/1\n\nIreland to win: 1/12\n\nRead our guide on betings tips and latest odds.\n\nWhat is our prediction?\n\nIreland started the tournament strongly with a comfortable 27-3 win over Scotland and, with arguably the toughest of quarter-finals to come - against either South Africa or New Zealand - Joe Schmidt's men will want to maintain a high-level of performance in preparation for the knockout stages. Japan do have an upset in them, we have seen that before, but their performance against Russia on the opening night was too inaccurate and error-strewn to suggest that they will cause a shock on Saturday. In 2015 against South Africa, they were more of an unknown quantity; this time, Ireland will be ready.\n\nScore prediction: Japan 10 Ireland 30.\n\nRead our expert's predictions for the tournament.", "description": "Japan vs Ireland\u00a0in the Rugby World Cup\u00a0Pool A.\u00a0It is both of these teams' second game of the tournament, with the winner set to improve their qualification hopes significantly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/v3KHl05HEaXi8SnCTcODWw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/i4N.3S_pDXF_vUstTn2_BA--~B/aD0xNTU5O3c9MjQ5MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/cfd8cf789e24ca54d34556fcacf22eef", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
