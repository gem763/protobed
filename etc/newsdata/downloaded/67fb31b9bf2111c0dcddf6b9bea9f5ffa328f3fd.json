It\u2019s sometime around 1947. The war is over, the Germans are gone, the Gestapo is no longer hunting Jews. Some of their local henchmen have been imprisoned or shot. Many just took off their uniforms and returned to their former lives.\n\nThe mother speaks with the trace of a foreign accent. As she reaches for her wallet to pay, the grocer says: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you people go back to where you came from?\u201d\n\nWhere, precisely, would that even be? The woman had fled Moscow for Berlin as a girl, after the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917 and arrested her father, who was never to be heard from again. Later, when still in her twenties, she had fled Berlin for Milan, sometime between Hitler\u2019s coming to power in 1933 and Mussolini\u2019s enactment of the racial laws in 1938.\n\nShe and her daughter were citizens of no country, living under a made-up name. They had nowhere to return, no place to go, no way to stay, and nothing they could do about any of it. To go back to the Soviet Union would have been suicidal. Israel did not yet exist. Germany was out of the question. America\u2019s doors were mostly shut.", "description": "Under Donald Trump, America is ceasing to be the last best hope.", "authors": ["Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/opinion/13stephensWeb/13stephensWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
