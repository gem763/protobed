From the show\u2019s unforgettable main title theme to melodic adaptations of the lyrics to songs from George R. R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire book series like \u201cThe Rains of Castamere\u201d and \u201cJenny of Oldstones,\u201d Game of Thrones\u2018 music became so popular over the course of its eight-season run that Djawadi decided to create an experience that would allow fans to enjoy his compositions in a live concert format.\n\nDjawadi tells TIME that it was Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss who originally gave him the idea for the Game of Thrones Live Concert Experience. \u201cWe were in the studio \u2014 this was at the end of season 3 when they heard \u201cMhysa,\u201d which is the final piece of the season \u2014 and they said, \u2018Ramin, you should do a concert. Why don\u2019t you do a live concert?'\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I just kind of ran with that comment and fulfilled my childhood dream, which was going on tour.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9s Jim\u00e9nez\n\nThe Game of Thrones Live Concert Experience kicked off in 2017 with a 24-date tour that hit cities across the United States and Canada, finishing up in early October. Djawadi then took the show international in 2018 before bringing it back for a third and final run in outdoor theaters across North America this year.\n\nThe concert features a live orchestra and soloists, including Djawadi (who plays electric guitar and piano in the show), performing highlights from the Game of Thrones soundtrack against a backdrop of scenes from the series projected on a big screen and visual effects like pyrotechnics and simulated snow. Its 2019 iteration includes music from all eight seasons, with a post-intermission second half dedicated entirely to pieces from the final two seasons.\n\nDjawadi says that his goal was to make the concert as captivating an experience as possible for fans. \u201cI wanted to put a contemporary spin on the show. I said, \u2018We have dragons in [Game of Thrones], why can\u2019t we have some pyro[technics] in the [concert]? Let\u2019s make it a bit more rock and roll,'\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cCreatively, we said, \u2018Let\u2019s make it an immersive experience and really have the fans feel like they\u2019re in Westeros.'\u201d\n\nAt the Sept. 14 concert at Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater in Wantagh, N.Y. \u2014 one of only four shows that Djawadi himself is scheduled to appear at this time around \u2014 arguably the most memorable moment came when Djawadi sat down at the piano to perform \u201cThe Night King,\u201d the nearly 9-minute-long track that accompanies the climax of the battle between the living and the dead in the third episode of Game of Thrones\u2018 season 8, \u201cThe Long Night.\u201d\n\nDjawadi says that the piano-centric \u201cThe Night King\u201d was the piece from Thrones\u2018 final season that was the most challenging to compose. \u201cThere\u2019s this long sequence when the Night King does a final walk towards Bran. That was a particularly tricky scene to write because it was long, it was all music and we had this idea to tie the scene to the \u2018Light of the Seven\u2019 scene from season 6 [when Cersei blows up the Sept of Baelor], which was the first time we used piano.\u201d\n\nLena Headey as Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones Season 6, Episode 10 HBO\n\nHe says that part of the difficulty lay in determining how to connect \u201cThe Night King\u201d to \u201cLight of the Seven\u201d without making the tracks too similar. \u201cTrying to figure out how to make [\u2018The Night King\u2019] a cousin of [\u2018Light of the Seven\u2019] but yet a completely new piece and emotionally related to what was happening in the scene was definitely challenging.\u201d\n\nDjawadi says linking the two pieces allowed the music to function as a sort of red herring for the episode\u2019s end. \u201cIn season 6 when we used the piano for the first time, it was a really big deal. The audience really picked up on that because we had never used that instrument before,\u201d he says. \u201cWe knew people would think back to \u2018Light of the Seven\u2019 and how everything went Cersei\u2019s way\u2026We knew that if we played an emotional piano piece, it would feel like this is the final blow, it\u2019s over and the Night King is going to win. And then of course, Arya comes in at the end and saves the day, so we were able to set up this emotional finale in a way that the sudden turn was unexpected.\u201d\n\nArya Stark (Maisie Williams) tries to kill the Night King on Game of Thrones. Helen Sloan\u2014HBO\n\nWhen Djawadi and his accompanying orchestra performed \u201cThe Night King\u201d at Jones Beach Theater, the performance earned a hearty round of applause and enthusiastic cheers from the audience. That reception is hardly surprising, considering that the track immediately went viral after premiering on the show in April, garnering over 2.2 million streams that month alone.\n\nAfter the final Game of Thrones Live Concert Experience show comes to a close on Oct. 5, fans will be able to continue streaming not only \u201cThe Night King,\u201d but the entirety of the Game of Thrones soundtrack on a variety of different platforms. But for Djawadi himself, the end of the tour will mark the end of a defining era of his career.\n\n\u201cI love the show and working with David and Dan so much. It was such a long run and it was such a family,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cHaving the concert is a nice way of hanging onto the show and having the music still out there. As much work as it is to prepare these concerts, the payoff is just so great. To connect with the audience, it\u2019s been something I\u2019ve really enjoyed.\u201d\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "description": "Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi's immersive live concert lets fans relive the most epic moments from all eight seasons of Thrones.", "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ramin-djawadi-game-of-thrones-live-concert-experience.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
