Sondland\u2019s whereabouts have been a bit of a mystery, according to three individuals familiar with his work throughout the European Union.\n\nLast week he skipped a teleconference with other European ambassadors. Two sources said he missed the call because he was traveling. One other person familiar with Sondland\u2019s schedule told The Daily Beast he was still on the job but would not elaborate about the ambassador\u2019s travel. Three sources said he has been out of the Brussels office for more than a week.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nAmbassador Sondland Throws Trump Under the Bus\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers are considering bringing Sondland back in for questioning following last week\u2019s deposition by William Taylor, America\u2019s top diplomat to Ukraine. According to a copy of his remarks, Taylor said Trump told Sondland Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had to say something in public and \u201cclear things up\u201d about investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country.\n\nLawmakers said that Taylor\u2019s account puts the onus on Sondland to come back and clear up inconsistencies or gaps in his initial testimony, during which he frequently said he didn\u2019t recall certain events.\n\n\u201cGenerally, it might be a good idea for Mr. Sondland to want to come back,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) after hearing from Taylor, whose appearance last Tuesday most clearly established the quid-pro-quo regarding U.S. security aid and Ukrainian investigation of the Bidens that Trump is denying he sought.\n\n\u201cObviously you could call everyone back, but I think Mr. Sondland has some more explaining to do,\u201d added Connolly.\n\nTop lawmakers involved in the impeachment inquiry have generally avoided talking about whether Sondland should return for testimony, preferring to focus on the other witnesses who are lined up for depositions in the coming days. A spokesperson for House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) declined to comment on whether Sondland would be asked to come back.\n\nBut Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee that is helping to lead the inquiry, did not rule out the possibility last week.\n\n\"I think it's too early to comment until we've seen everything, until everybody's testified,\u201d Engel told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut I wouldn't be reluctant to call someone back if we felt we needed clarification.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
