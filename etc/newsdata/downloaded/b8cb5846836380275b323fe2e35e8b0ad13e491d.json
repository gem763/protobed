While Alexander, Roberts, and Enzi represent solidly red states that will likely stay Republican in 2020, Isakson\u2019s decision to resign at the end of 2019 for health reasons sets up a second Senate election in Georgia, where David Perdue is already up for reelection next year. The Democrat Stacey Abrams nearly won Georgia\u2019s governorship in 2018, making the race for Isakson\u2019s Senate seat potentially competitive next year\u2014and one that could have big implications for control of the chamber.\n\nIn the House, the GOP departures point to a pair of ominous trends for the party: the loss of several members of its dwindling contingent of minority and women lawmakers, and an exodus from Texas (or what Democrats are already calling a \u201cTexodus\u201d).\n\nThe retirement of Representative Will Hurd of Texas stung\u2014and surprised\u2014Republicans the most. As the lone black Republican in the House, the former CIA officer, who represents a swing district along the border, was once seen as a rising star in the party at a time when it seemed Republicans would pursue bipartisan immigration legislation that could appeal to Latino voters. Yet Hurd decided to leave in the weeks after a series of racist tweets by the president appeared to crystallize a 2020 electoral strategy of mobilizing the GOP\u2019s white base.\n\nRead: Will Hurd could be the canary in the coal mine\n\nRepublicans were also taken aback by the departures of Representatives Susan Brooks of Indiana and Martha Roby of Alabama\u2014two of just 13 GOP women in the House. Brooks is serving as the party\u2019s House-candidate-recruitment chief heading into 2020, making her decision to leave even more difficult to swallow. (The retiring House Republicans do not include former Representative Tom Marino of Pennsylvania, who left Congress so early in his term\u2014just two weeks after being sworn in\u2014that a special election has already been held to replace him.)\n\nThree of the six retiring Texans are getting out ahead of difficult reelection battles after narrowly winning in 2018. Their exits, along with former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s surprisingly strong Senate bid last year, are a reason Democrats are bullish on their chances of picking up even more House seats in Texas, flipping one of its two state legislative chambers, and possibly even turning it blue on the presidential level in 2020.\n\nData sources: Each district\u2019s presidential-election results are from the Daily Kos. House and Senate election results are from the Associated Press.\n\nSenate Republicans Retiring Outright\n\nLamar Alexander, Tennessee\n\n2016 presidential election: +26.15 Trump\n\n2014 Senate election: +30.1 Alexander\n\nOne of the Senate\u2019s few remaining bipartisan dealmakers, Alexander announced late in 2018 that he would retire after three terms. Over a 40-year career in politics, Alexander had previously served as governor of Tennessee and education secretary under President George H. W. Bush. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. In recent years, Alexander has earned a reputation for working with liberal Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington from his perch as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Tennessee is deeply Republican: Democrats fell well short in their bid to pick up retiring Republican Senator Bob Corker\u2019s seat in 2018, making it difficult to see how they could create a competitive race in 2020.", "description": "For the second consecutive election, more Republicans than Democrats are forgoing reelection, a potentially ominous sign for the GOP in 2020.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/retirement_tracker_3/facebook.jpg?1567607417", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
