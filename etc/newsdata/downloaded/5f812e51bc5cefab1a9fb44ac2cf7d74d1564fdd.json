REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nCentral banks backed negative interest rate policies in a new survey released Monday, arguing that the unconventional monetary policy tool was \u201cfairly effective\u201d in easing financial conditions in many corners of the world.\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements, the organization run by 60 central banks from around the world, released a report praising negative interest rates for providing expansionary stimulus. The BIS claimed that negative interest rates did not appear to damage bank profitability or encourage cash hoarding.\n\n\"[C]entral banks judged that negative policy rates contributed to the achievement of their policy goals and that their side effects have been contained,\u201d the BIS report read.\n\nThe BIS noted that the scope of its review covered \u201cmodestly\u201d negative interest rates and cautioned that its effectiveness thus far could be different if rates fall further. The central banks surveyed also said the longer-term effects of the unprecedented policy \u201ccannot be fully assessed on the basis of current experience.\u201d\n\nSeveral member central banks of the BIS have pursued negative interest rate policy, which charges financial institutions for storing reserves at the central bank. Whereas \u201cconventional\u201d interest rate policy would reward a bank for leaving money at the central bank, negative interest rates would incentivize banks to withdraw its reserves and instead use that money for other purposes, like lending.\n\nBecause negative interest rate policies are a relatively new tool, its effectiveness in fighting macroeconomic headwinds are still up for debate, as are its side effects on financial markets and consumer behavior.\n\nIn 2009, the Swedish Riksbank became the first central bank to implement such a policy. Amid sluggish macroeconomic factors, the European Central Bank, the Danmarks Nationalbank, the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank of Japan all introduced negative interest rates between 2014 and 2016.\n\nBetween mid-2014 and 2016, four central banks introduced negative rates.

The BIS said net interest margin, a key measure of interest earned on loans minus interest paid on deposits, were compressed by negative interest rates but said banks were able to counteract those impacts by investing in riskier assets or raising fees.\n\nRegarding concerns over cash hoarding as a result of negative rates on deposits, the survey said negative interest rates were not ultimately passed onto retail deposits, meaning consumers did not pull their deposits en masse.\n\nThe BIS cautioned that there are some dangers to negative interest rates, such as creating \u201cfrothy\u201d stock valuations and distortions in short-term money market and government bond market liquidity.\n\nBrian Cheung is a reporter covering the banking industry and the intersection of finance and policy for Yahoo Finance.
