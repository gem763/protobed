Chief executive Alex Cobham said the proposal lacks ambition, and introduces more complexity and uncertainty \u201cfor tax abusers to hide behind\u201d.\n\n\u201cGiven a once-in-a-century opportunity to reform and reinvigorate a broken international tax system that loses $500bn in government revenue to corporate tax abuse every year, the OECD has decided to tinker around the edges,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe OECD is now raising the prospect of carving out businesses that are not directly \u2018consumer-facing\u2019 \u2026 To be clear, there is no suggestion that non-consumer-facing multinationals are not also engaged in corporate tax abuse.\u201d", "description": "A radical shake-up of international tax rules, proposed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), would force large multinational companies to pay taxes even in countries where they do not have a physical presence.
