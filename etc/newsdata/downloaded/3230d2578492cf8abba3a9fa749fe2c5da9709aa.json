Ironically, I have heard rumors of climbers being contracted by zoos to test animal enclosures, but that is about all.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople and executives at the country\u2019s oldest and largest climbing and mountaineering groups, including the American Alpine Club, Mazamas, the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the Alpine Institute, were similarly at a loss.", "description": "", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "Thedailybeast.Com Trump-Said-This-Wall-Cant-Be-Climbed-Professional-Climbers-Say-Hes-Full-Of-Sht"], "top_image": ""}
