FEDWATCH\n\nWhile projections for further cuts are providing some\n\nsupport to gold, there is \"definitely some caution\" in the\n\nmarket, Saxo Bank commodity strategist Ole Hansen said.\n\n\"The fact that we're seeing volatility being sent lower,\n\nstock markets at near record highs especially in United States -\n\nthat's reducing the need for gold, at least in the near term,\"\n\nhe said.\n\nA retreat in European shares on Monday after five straight\n\ndays of gains and a drip in the dollar index from a one-week\n\nhigh helped hold bullion steady. .EU USD/\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials are \"close to finalising\" some\n\nparts of a trade agreement after high-level telephone\n\ndiscussions on Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative's office\n\nand China's Commerce Ministry said. U.S. President Donald Trump last week said Washington was\n\ndoing well in its trade negotiations with China and that China\n\nwants to make a deal \"very badly\". \"Gold remains supported by an expected Fed rate cut, but\n\ngains could be limited by ongoing trade talks and a probable EU\n\n27 extension which quashes the no-deal Brexit risk,\" AxiTrader\n\nmarket strategist Stephen Innes said in a note.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said that the 27\n\ncountries that will remain in the European Union after Britain\n\nleaves agreed on Monday to accept London's request for a Brexit\n\nextension until January 31, 2020.\n\nHedge funds and money managers raised their bullish\n\npositions in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to Oct.\n\n22, data showed on Friday.
