Their previous partners, the right-wing League, brought down Europe\u2019s first post-war populist government after 15 months by calling a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. League leader Matteo Salvini\u2019s bid to trigger a new election backfired and banished him to the opposition.\n\n\u201cNow we have [to go] the last mile,\u201d 5Star leader Luigi Di Maio said in a press conference after the vote, referring to the need for a list of Cabinet ministers.\n\nAs for Salvini, he attacked the new government, saying in a tweet that the parties' only common denominator is \u201chatred towards the League.\u201d He added that the new government \u201cwill reopen ports and borders\u201d and in another tweet predicted that the new coalition won't last long.\n\nThe vote was deemed essential for the formation of the new government. If party members had voted down the deal, Di Maio, who didn't make clear how he would vote, would have had to withdraw his support for the new alliance. However, 5Star rules say the vote could have been repeated if deemed necessary by the movement's founder, comedian Beppe Grillo.\n\nThe 5Stars and Democratic Party make an unlikely couple, as the former was founded as a rejection of established parties like the PD. The new government was made possible by abrupt U-turns from key players like the former PD leader Matteo Renzi and by Grillo himself.\n\n\u201cNow we go to change Italy,\u201d the leader of the PD Nicola Zingaretti wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe new government will be less confrontational toward Brussels than the 5Stars/League, especially on migration where Salvini\u2019s hard-line stance put him at odds with Italy\u2019s EU partners. The 5Stars and PD will attempt to strike a balance between growth-boosting economic measures and a more cautious approach to the budget than the outgoing formation, according to a draft of their joint policy program.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we aim to change the Stability Pact rules and all the austerity measures that have put a brake on the European economy and especially on the Italian one,\u201d said a note from Tiziana Beghin, head of the 5Star delegation in the European Parliament.\n\nConte, an independent who is close to the 5Stars, will stay on as prime minister. He's expected to present a list of ministers to President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday, when the new government is expected to be sworn in. A vote of confidence in the two chambers will take place either later this week or at the beginning of next week.\n\nA League official, Andrea Crippa, claimed that up to nine 5Stars lawmakers in the Senate could leave the party to join the League, making it more difficult to reach the required majority of 161 votes. But there has been no official confirmation of the claim.\n\nThe new government is expected to have Di Maio as foreign minister and Roberto Gualtieri, chair of the European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, as economy minister. At the interior ministry, which was in Salvini's hands, is expected to be a non-political figure, such as migration expert Luciana Lamorgese.\n\nAs for the Italian nominee for the European Commission, party officials say the name is expected will be made official after the vote of confidence, with an indication of the name expected Wednesday or Thursday.", "description": "Giuseppe Conte will remain as prime minister after 5Stars back deal with center left.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Stephen Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1164516482-1200x628.jpg"}
