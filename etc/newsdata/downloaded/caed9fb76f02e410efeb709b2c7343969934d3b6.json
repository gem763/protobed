For some, the results can be not only unexpected, but can radically change their lives. WSJ\u2019s Amy Dockser Marcus explains. Photo illustration: Laura Kammermann/WSJ\n\nAs soon as *Stacey arrived to get her DNA results interpreted, she saw a flicker of confusion across the woman\u2019s face.\n\nThe American woman tried to stay calm \u2013 convincing herself that she had imagined the baffled expression.\n\nBut Stacey was unable to shake the feeling of unease. After all, she is adopted and had no idea what secrets her DNA might be hiding about her biological family.\n\nBut it\u2019s vry safe to say that she never would have expected what happened next.\n\n\u201c'It looks like I\u2019ve found your birth mum,' the woman said. 'But\u2026,' she continued. 'It looks like the same person is coming up for your boyfriend',\u201d Stacey first wrote on Love What Matters.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t quite process what she was trying to tell me. Me. Him. Boyfriend? Same mother? What. That makes us\u2026 what? No. NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT. This can\u2019t be true. Oh, but it was.\u201d\n\nWant to more news like this?

To mark National Adoption Awareness Month, Adopt Change CEO Renee Carter is calling for red tape to be cut so children can be more easily placed in a permanent home. Ms Carter says the foster care system can be \u2018really damaging\u2019 for children, with some moving up to 70 times, \u2018so really it\u2019s just not good enough\u2019.\n\n\"Stacey\u2019s parents couldn\u2019t tell her much about her biological family.\" Source: iStock\n\nIt only brought them closer\n\nIt would be months before Stacey and Tyler would learn the truth.\n\nIn the meantime, the pair started dating, spending more and more time together.\n\nAbout four months into their relationship, the couple realised that they had both been adopted and had no contact with their biological parents.\n\nAt the time, no alarm bells went off in Stacey\u2019s mind.\n\nInstead, she was just relieved that Tyler could really understand her painful journey as an adopted kid.\n\nIt only brought them closer together.\n\nThe Christmas present that changed everything\n\nBy the time their first Christmas came around, Stacey and Tyler had said 'I love you' and were planning their lives together.\n\nFor months they had been talking about taking DNA tests to learn more about their biological families.\n\nThe only problem was the hefty price tag for each test.\n\nStacey thought it would be romantic to save up for two tests as Christmas presents for her and Tyler.\n\nTyler loved the gift and together they sent in the tests, excited to finally get to know their biological families.\n\n\"We had no idea!\"\n\nBut as Stacey would soon learn, this would actually end up being more confusing.\n\nStruggling to piece together her family tree, Stacey went to see a \u2018DNA search angel\u2019 to help her fill in the blanks.\n\nIt was there that she discovered that she and Tyler were actually siblings who had been separated at birth.\n\n\u201cImagine having your boyfriend who you LOVED come to visit you at your house and having to break the news that 'hey, I might be your sister. Actually, I am your sister. 100 percent',\u201d Stacey said.\n\n\u201c'Yeah, you know those awful bio parents of ours that totally kicked us to the curb and ditched us? They\u2019re actually the same ones'.\n\n\u201cI remember him staring blankly at me, \u2018what do you mean we\u2019re siblings??!!?!?!\u2019\n\n\u201cWe had been dating for several months at that point. We had no idea! It\u2019s a unique trauma.\u201d\n\n\"We\u2019re better together\"\n\nIt\u2019s now been a year since Stacey and Tyler discovered the truth about their heritage.\n\nObviously, the revelation has been tough on both of them \u2013 after all, as Stacey said, there aren\u2019t exactly support groups for \u2018accidental incest\u2019.\n\nThey are both still in counselling and took a two-month break from speaking to each other.\n\n\u201cBut through it all, we\u2019ve decided to still love each other, just in a different way now,\u201d Stacey said.\n\n\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a unique trauma, but no one knows it better than we do.\n\n\u201cWe went from strangers to lovers, to sister and brother, to strangers to great friends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we are still there for each other. We\u2019re better together.\u201d\n\n*Names have been changed", "description": "\"He opened it on Christmas Eve, a huge smile on his face - things got weird after that.\"", "authors": ["Madeline Cox"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/0b577a0ae082f9ab8dacd122de92fac7", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
