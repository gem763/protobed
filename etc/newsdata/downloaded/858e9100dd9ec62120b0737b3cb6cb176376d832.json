Do you think the party is going to resonate with young people? people your age and young?\n\nMEGHAN MCCAIN: I really worry about it because \u2014 and the numbers show this \u2014 whatever you say about the left, there are people like [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] that do a really good job at speaking to young people. And I think for us, and I always laugh, like, the young Republican groups start at 40. I think post-Trump America, for the party, is going to be very, very dark to rebuild.\n\nHOOVER: I don\u2019t know how we rebuild, but Cindy, you just shook your head. As you think about your children, your children and having Republican appeal, this concerns you?\n\nCINDY MCCAIN: It concerns me very much and I\u2019ll speak from my own homestate where the party has simply left normal, what I would consider normal Republicans behind. Until our party goes back to what we were best at, and that was an open system, an open tent, where we invited everybody in. Those are the days that I grew up in Republican politics and those were the good days. President Trump has done some things, that you know, all of us, as Meghan said, it\u2019s been\u2013they\u2019ve been controversial, they\u2019ve been different from what any other president has done and not in good ways.
