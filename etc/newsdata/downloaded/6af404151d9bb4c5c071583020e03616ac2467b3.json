But it makes perfect sense that the term mom jeans would come about as a pejorative at a time when high-waisted, loose-fitting jeans looked particularly conservative compared with what trendy young women were wearing. As Beth Montemurro, a sociology professor at Penn State University at Abington who researches gender and sexuality over the life course, told me, many stereotypes about moms and motherhood serve to desexualize mothers. \u201cThere seems to be a separation between the identities of \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018mother,\u2019\u201d Montemurro said, and an expectation that \u201ca mother is a particular type of woman whose focus is on her children, or should be \u2026 and often she\u2019s expected to be an example of modesty, particularly for her daughters.\u201d (This is despite the fact that sex and motherhood are, in most cases, necessarily linked, she added.)\n\nThe stereotype is so powerful that linking something to motherhood can extinguish its sex appeal pretty quickly. Mom haircuts, mom sneakers\u2014phrases like these call to mind an image of \u201csomebody who\u2019s not necessarily with it,\u201d Montemurro said, enough so that MILF and cool mom have emerged as descriptors that signify an exception to the norm of unsexy, uncool motherhood.\n\nFashion, however, is both a cycle and a pendulum, McClendon noted: Trends come, go, and later come around again. Many fashion trends simply boil down to the exact opposite of what was just trendy. The ultra-low-rise, flared jeans popular among women in the 2000s harked back to the jeans of the late \u201960s, so it was only a matter of time before jeans began to once again look more like the high-waisted, straight-legged jeans of the late \u201970s and \u201980s. But this time there was a phrase for that silhouette\u2014and today, brands such as Zara, Madewell, H&M, Levi\u2019s, Reformation, and Topshop all sell a high-waisted, straight-legged, rigid-denim product advertised explicitly as a \u201cmom jean.\u201d\n\nMany industry analysts and observers attribute the resurgence of the mom jean, and other formerly uncool items such as fanny packs and \u201cdad sneakers,\u201d to the semi-ironic \u201cnormcore\u201d trend that arose in the mid-2010s. \u201cClothes that were otherwise considered frumpy 10 years ago are now being picked up and championed,\u201d McClendon said, \u201cas a sort of rebuke, but in a tongue-in-cheek way.\u201d\n\nRead: The sneaky way clothing brands hooked men on stretch jeans\n\nBut McClendon suggested that there\u2019s more driving the shift toward modest, comfortable, practical clothing than playful irony. After the 2016 election and the national reckoning with powerful men\u2019s sexual misconduct sparked by the #MeToo movement, she began to notice a clear \u201cshift away from extremely sexy clothes, toward a more unisex style,\u201d she told me. She saw women ditch their stilettos for designer sneakers and their dresses for tailored suits. \u201cThe tight clothes, the high heels\u2014there was this general sense of Why am I wearing these things?\u201d As the national mood sobered, McClendon noted, the body-punishing, form-fitting extremes to which high-profile women pushed their looks in the 2000s (McClendon pointed to Lady Gaga and her famously tall heels as an example) gave way to androgynous shapes and looks that prioritized comfort. Today, the zeitgeist-iest young pop star of the moment is 17-year-old Billie Eilish, \u201cwho wears very large, oversized clothing that\u2019s completely body-obscuring and unisex,\u201d she added.", "description": "Straight-legged, high-waisted jeans were almost casualties of reductive stereotypes about motherhood\u2014but now they\u2019re back.", "authors": ["Ashley Fetters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/shutterstock_742819582/facebook.jpg?1567010986"}
