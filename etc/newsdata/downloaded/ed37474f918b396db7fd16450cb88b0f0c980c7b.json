Here's a look at some of the things they could do with the money:\n\nRent a one-bedroom apartment\n\nAn extra $1,000 would cover the $960 median rent for a one-bedroom apartment, according Apartment List\u2019s September 2019 National Rent Report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYang's Freedom Dividend would cover the rent for a one-bedroom apartment.
