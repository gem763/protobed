In the fall of 1880, he delivered a series of lectures for the Lowell Institute, later published under the title The Common Law. Every Tuesday and Friday for six weeks, Holmes developed the idea that the common law had evolved not according to any internal reason but according to the felt imperatives of the day. \u201cThe life of the law,\u201d Holmes wrote, \u201chas not been logic: it has been experience.\u201d The core function of judges was to make public policy. Several decades later, jurists would name this philosophy \u201clegal realism.\u201d\n\nCritics say realism is the abandonment of the very idea of law as a neutral field of moral principle. Nonetheless, it has been the United States\u2019 distinctive contribution in modern legal thought, and Holmes laid its foundation.\n\nAppointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1902, Holmes soon gave voice to his idea of the law as an evolving balance of conflicting interests. In the 1905 case of Lochner v. New York, Holmes dissented from a decision to strike down a New York maximum-hours law limiting bake shop workers to no more than ten hours of work each day. Writing for the court\u2019s majority, Justice Rufus Peckham contended that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause prevented state legislatures from interfering with bakers\u2019 freedom to contract. But Holmes observed that states constrained the liberty of individuals all the time. The Constitution, he continued, \u201cis made for people of fundamentally differing views\u201d about which constraints on liberty ought to be enacted into law. The court\u2019s job was to respect the result arrived at in the political sphere.\n\nHolmes\u2019s most infamous decision did this and more. In 1924, Virginia had enacted a state law authorizing officials at state institutions to sterilize inmates afflicted with \u201cidiocy, imbecility, feeble-mindedness\u201d or \u201chereditary forms of insanity.\u201d An 18-year-old named Carrie Buck challenged the law as a violation of the Due Process Clause. Buck was in no way feebleminded. She had been sent to an institution for the feebleminded to hide a pregnancy resulting from sexual abuse, only to find herself caught up in the state\u2019s new eugenics law.\n\nIn the Supreme Court, her lawyers relied on the same argument that had protected Joseph Lochner\u2019s freedom to contract two decades earlier. Forced sterilization interfered with the personal liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Holmes disagreed. Now writing for the majority, in Buck v. Bell he upheld the state\u2019s sterilization law on the ground that \u201cThree generations of imbeciles is enough.\u201d Budiansky tells us that Holmes was \u201cunusually proud of his opinion in Buck.\u201d \u201cI purposely used short and rather brutal words,\u201d the justice wrote to his friend Harold Laski. With Holmes\u2019s approval, eugenicist policies thrived in the United States for a decade, until at last revulsion at Nazi atrocities produced a backlash.\n\nLess well known is Holmes\u2019s majority opinion in 1903 in the case of Giles v. Harris. Budiansky does not give the case much attention, but it is arguably more significant. The decision turned back the claims of a black post office employee named Jackson Giles and more than 5,000 black men in the Colored Men\u2019s Suffrage Association of Alabama. Giles aimed to defeat the new state constitution\u2019s Jim Crow \u201cgrandfather clause,\u201d designed to prevent black men from registering to vote. Holmes upheld the clause on the theory that courts lacked the capacity to deliver the kinds of political relief Giles requested. Only Congress, Holmes concluded, could provide a remedy for black men who wanted to vote in Alabama, though he knew that no such remedy would be forthcoming.\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1919, Holmes adopted a startling new approach in the court\u2019s free speech cases. For decades, he had insisted that courts should defer to legislative bodies as the authorized will of the community. His opinions in Giles, in Lochner, and in Buck v. Bell advanced this theme. But in the aftermath of World War I, he switched.\n\nHolmes had been hostile to free speech claims before 1919. As Budiansky explains, Holmes had long followed the conventional nineteenth-century view that the First Amendment meant the freedom to say and publish what one wanted, not the freedom to evade punishment after the fact for what one had said. Even as late as the spring of 1919, Holmes advanced a version of this long-standing view when he wrote the court\u2019s opinion upholding a wartime Espionage Act conviction and concurred in the court\u2019s decision affirming a ten-year prison sentence for Eugene Debs, the perennial Socialist presidential candidate.\n\nWhen the case of United States v. Abrams arrived on the court\u2019s docket that fall, Holmes reversed his position. Writing in dissent and joined by Justice Louis Brandeis, he argued that leaflets condemning U.S. military intervention in Russia and calling for a workers\u2019 revolution were protected by the First Amendment. His opinion became perhaps the most famous articulation of a theory of the First Amendment. \u201cTime,\u201d he wrote, \u201chas upset many fighting faiths.\u201d The beliefs of one generation are overturned by the next. It follows, Holmes said, that \u201cthe best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.\u201d For the next decade, Holmes and Brandeis dissented in a steady stream of free speech cases. In 1931, when the court\u2019s majority began to side with speakers and against the government, Holmes was still on the court to see the reversal.\n\nHolmes retired from the court the next year. He died three years later, at the age of 93. In the years after Holmes\u2019s death, his two most famous dissents\u2014Lochner and Abrams\u2014became cardinal principles in the transformed Supreme Court. The justices would no longer strike down democratically enacted social legislation that had at least a reasonable basis; the Due Process Clause would no longer serve as a counter-majoritarian vehicle for laissez-faire policies. At the same time, the court emerged for the first time in American history as a defender of robust speech rights.\n\nBudiansky presents these two traditions in the modern Supreme Court\u2014democracy and free speech\u2014as Holmes\u2019s triumphant legacies today. But in our time, the already awkward relationship between these two legacies has broken down into warring standoff. Beginning in the 1970s, the Supreme Court\u2019s First Amendment decisions have obstructed campaign finance rules necessary to protect democracy from the undue influence of wealth. The court has struck down third-party expenditure caps in election campaigns and restrictions on corporate political contributions. In 2007, the court overturned bans on certain corporate political \u201cissue-ads.\u201d In the Citizens United case of 2010, the court struck down restrictions on election-related speech by corporations.\n\nFree speech law in recent years has also undermined democratic regulation of the marketplace. The court has struck down advertising rules in the pharmaceutical market, invalidated state limits on the sale of medical information, and overruled mandatory employee fees to fund the unions that represent public employees in collective bargaining. Lower courts have gone even further, reversing Food and Drug Administration efforts to add graphic warning labels to cigarettes and establishing new First Amendment rights to market pharmaceuticals. As Justice Elena Kagan noted in a blistering Holmesian dissent in the Janus case in 2018, the court today has \u201cweaponize[d] the First Amendment.\u201d The Lochner majority that Holmes disdained rides again. Ironically, it does so by deploying principles established in Holmes\u2019s free speech dissents.\n\nTo Budiansky\u2019s credit, he draws attention to early evidence that free speech might wreak havoc on efforts to regulate the market. In Leach v. Carlile, decided in 1922, the court heard the appeal of a patent medicine inventor promising to cure \u201cweakened manhood.\u201d Seven justices upheld the Postmaster General\u2019s decision to exclude the dubious advertisements from the mails. But Holmes and Brandeis dissented, contending that the Postmaster General \u201cabridged freedom of speech on the part of the sender.\u201d Budiansky does not say so, but Holmes\u2019s obscure Leach dissent is now nearly as prophetic as his dissent in Abrams. Holmes anticipated the use of free speech claims not to vindicate democracy but to disrupt it.\n\nHolmes may have been a prophet of modern liberalism, as Menand and Wilson contend. But that liberalism turned out to be riven with internal contradictions. Holmes leaves us with the same tensions between democracy and freedom that he once seemed to have resolved.\n\nBudiansky is not a jurist. He aims to establish what he calls a \u201csympathetic view\u201d of Holmes not as a theorist or a symbol but as a person. And here he is quite successful. Budiansky\u2019s Holmes had a sense of humor, one that was \u201cmordantly focused on the folly of human overimportance.\u201d Asked to describe his colleague John Harlan, Holmes said that \u201cHarlan\u2019s mind was like a vise, the jaws of which did not meet.\u201d Holmes had a blue streak, too. Writing opinions, he told his law clerks, was \u201cjust like pissing: you apply a pressure \u2026 and out it comes.\u201d Late in his life, when his law clerks had begun to read to him, he asked a mortified clerk to clarify the plot of one especially baroque novel: \u201cAm I to understand that the young man fucked his mother-in-law?\u201d\n\nHolmes\u2019s law clerks, or secretaries, as they were known in Holmes\u2019s day, offered more meaningful friendships than his fellow justices. They were a parade of Harvard Law School\u2019s best new graduates, including such figures as future attorney general Francis Biddle, Alger Hiss, and New Deal power broker Thomas Corcoran. Yet the never-ending supply of bright young men was a mixed blessing. Learned Hand, the great mid-century New York judge, later regretted that he and other young admirers \u201cindulged themselves so much in flattery\u201d of the justice. \u201cAs I look back on it,\u201d Hand reflected, \u201cwe all did exploit him by playing on his vanity.\u201d With such adulation all around, it is little wonder that Holmes never confronted the tensions in his legal philosophy. Self-satisfaction hindered serious inquiry. The cult of Holmes rewarded the justice for producing apt epigrams as if they were original ideas.\n\nHis was in many ways a sheltered and cosseted life. Budiansky is refreshingly candid about the importance of Holmes\u2019s wealth to the figure he cut in life. By the late 1890s, Holmes\u2019s inheritances supplemented a decent salary to produce an income of about $20,000 per year, or 30 times the average household income in the state. In today\u2019s terms, it was as if Holmes had an investment income of $2.3 million each year, an annual return on a net worth of around $50 million. His household expenses, which Budiansky elaborates in great detail, amounted to twice his salary each month. The justice enjoyed expensive clothing and good shoes, champagne and other fine wines. His wife, Fanny, along with faithful maids, butlers, drivers, and messengers, helped arrange it all to his liking.\n\nWe don\u2019t find history\u2019s heroes where we used to. Less and less do we expect Olympian detachment on the Supreme Court. The court today is beset by partisan divides in a way that Holmes\u2019s generation could barely have understood. Perhaps it should surprise no one, then, that Holmes seems to have few answers to the pressing legal questions of our time. Budiansky tries to suggest otherwise. But the argument is not as compelling as it once was. A smaller, less magisterial Holmes may be just about right.", "description": "Why veneration of Oliver Wendell Holmes is in decline", "authors": ["John Fabian Witt"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/54053e757f79dc04bc44ac28c677d2e56e4f2f5e.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
