These devices collect data to provide in-depth tracking of many different exercise parameters for coaching, analysis, record-keeping, and other purposes. But with all that data, how can you be sure your privacy won\u2019t go flying out the window?\n\nWhat data is being collected?\n\nThe first key to securing data from a tracking device is understanding precisely what is in that data. The capabilities of wrist-worn trackers vary widely, from simply counting steps and measuring basic activity to tracking advanced human performance data like VO2 max (maximal oxygen uptake) and time spent in specific heart rate zones.\n\nMore sensors generate more data, meaning there\u2019s more sensitive information to protect\n\nMore performance parameters require more sensors, and more sensors generate more data, meaning there\u2019s more sensitive information to be protected. While your heart rate with no identifying information probably wouldn\u2019t mean a lot to someone who managed to see it, a wearable that keeps track of your running routes could provide information of great interest to stalkers or attackers. Other data, like the menstrual cycle tracking offered on some devices, could allow for a significant privacy breach.\n\nThe next key is knowing where the data that your tracker is collecting is stored. In older, very simple devices, like step counters or heart rate monitors, it simply stays on the wearable itself. If this is the case, security is simple: know where your tracker is.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019re using a fitness band or smartwatch, in which case you\u2019re probably connecting to an outside app for activity tracking, sharing, analysis, and / or coaching. That means your data is now out of your hands, and the word \u201ctrust\u201d becomes very important.\n\nIf trust isn\u2019t enough for you, there are several steps you can take to protect yourself when using a fitness tracker.\n\nRead the user agreement\n\nWhen you sign up for any of these services, whether they\u2019re provided by the device\u2019s vendor or a third party, you\u2019re presented with a user agreement. Before signing any of these documents, you should read it. You\u2019ll find out all sorts of interesting things, like just how much data the company collects from your wearable (and possibly your phone), what it can do with that data, how long it can keep the info, and whether you can get it back. (It also couldn\u2019t hurt to see if there\u2019s an arbitration clause you may want to opt out of.)\n\nIf any of the clauses in the user agreement give you pause, then that\u2019s exactly what you should do: pause\n\nIf any of the clauses in that agreement give you pause, that\u2019s exactly what you should do: pause. Decide whether the information and advice you get back are worth trusting the security of your personal data to the service. You get to make the decision, but make it an informed decision.\n\nLimit the data that is being collected\n\nAll too often, apps and devices collect far more data than is necessary. If possible, you should let them collect and store only the data required to give you the feedback you want. For example, if you want to count your steps and heartbeat but have no real interest in your sleeping habits, then turn the sleep tracker off.\n\nAlso, check regularly to make sure your apps haven\u2019t expanded their data footprint. If, for example, you want pace, cadence, and speed information, it\u2019s highly unlikely any of that will come from your phone\u2019s microphone. If the connecting app asks for that access, just say \u201cno.\u201d\n\nSet up two-factor authentication\n\nCurrently, one of the best ways to secure your accounts \u2014 including your fitness-tracking apps \u2014 is two-factor authentication or 2FA. A code is generated and sent to a trusted device (such as your phone), and you enter the code to verify your identity. There are several 2FA systems currently available. For example, if you\u2019re using an Apple Watch, you can use 2FA through iCloud. Check to find out which systems work with your fitness tracker. The extra security is worth the trouble.", "description": "It\u2019s safe to say that few technologies have changed personal fitness more than wearable fitness trackers like the Apple Watch, and the Garmin and Fitbit lines.
