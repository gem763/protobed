U.S. Senate Majority Leader McConnell waits for an elevator at the U.S. Capitol in Washington\n\nBy David Morgan\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democrats, looking to heighten their profile on the hot-button issue of gun control, moved forward on Tuesday with new measures aimed at curbing gun violence, while President Donald Trump also planned to huddle with Republican leaders.\n\nThe Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee began considering three pieces of gun legislation for the full House to review, more than a month after gun safety surged back to the forefront of U.S. public debate in the wake of back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio.\n\nThe bills are part of a coordinated strategy between House and Senate Democrats to put pressure on Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to allow a vote on gun-related bills including universal background check legislation that passed the House in February.\n\n\"We are not taking these additional actions simply to respond to mass shootings,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told the proceedings.\n\n\"We are acting because of the urgent need to respond to the daily toll of gun violence in our communities, whether they are mass shootings or not, and whether or not they make national headlines,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans pledged to support \"sensible\" legislation on guns but denounced the Democratic legislation as fatally flawed and a risk to gun owner rights under the Second Amendment.\n\n\"What I am not willing to do is support legislation that will do nothing to make us safer and simultaneously infringes on the rights and liberties guaranteed by our Constitution. Unfortunately, all three bills we are considering today do just that,\" said the committee's top Republican, Representative Doug Collins.\n\nThe panel began the debate with so-called red flag legislation that would provide grants and set standards for state court and law enforcement officials to remove guns from people deemed a risk to communities.\n\nOther measures would ban high-capacity ammunition magazines and extend an existing prohibition against gun possession for those convicted of hate crimes from the felony to the misdemeanor level.\n\nOther measures would ban high-capacity ammunition magazines and extend an existing prohibition against gun possession for those convicted of hate crimes from the felony to the misdemeanor level.\n\nTrump and Republican leaders from the House and Senate met at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. House Republican whip Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, later told reporters he did not know if Trump and Congress would ultimately come to an agreement on gun legislation.\n\nMcConnell reiterated on Tuesday that he would wait for the White House to propose gun legislation that Trump would sign. On Monday, Trump stressed the need to protect gun owner rights.
