The authorities found several small plastic bags as well as a straw cut into a shorter length.\n\nCatlett claimed that the items didn\u2019t belong to her and that somebody else had placed them in her front pocket.\n\nThe officers then turned to Furr and asked him if there was anything else illegal in the vehicle. He allegedly told them \u201cif there is anything in the car it would be in the console and it would be ice.\u201d\n\nPolice ended up recovering 0.5 grams of methamphetamine, a large number of alcohol swabs, medical supplies, and a glass smoking pipe from the vehicle, according to KATV.\n\nFurr then admitted to police that he and Catlett had used meth the day before. Authorities also noticed there were needle marks from IV usage on Catlett\u2019s arm. Both were subsequently taken to the Garland County Detention Center.\n\nWhile at the detention center, Catlett failed a field sobriety test and refused to submit to a chemical test because her brother fed her a sandwich that contained meth and that she thought he had put meth in her drink earlier in the evening; something he had habitually done, she alleged.\n\nFurr and Catlett currently remain in the detention center facing charges of possession of methamphetamine or cocaine with purpose to deliver and four counts of possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\nCatlett\u2019s bond was set at $14,500 with additional charges of DWI and refusal to submit to a chemical test. Furr\u2019s bond was set at $13,500. They will appear in Hot Spring District Court on Nov. 4.", "description": "An Arkansas woman who told police her brother fed her a methamphetamine sandwich has been arrested with him after police found copious amounts of drug paraphernalia.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/police-gty-er-191009_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
