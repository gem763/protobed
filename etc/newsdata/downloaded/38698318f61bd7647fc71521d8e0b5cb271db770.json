That is one of the reasons why the outlook is still a favorable one.\"\n\nPowell noted multiple challenges to that picture, specifically the drag from Europe and elsewhere. That's compounded by the tariff battle between the U.S. and China as well as a persistently low inflation rate that has run below the Fed's 2% target.\n\nHe said that trade uncertainty is weighing on business investment and confidence.\n\nHowever, he expects the problems to be contained and not become a major impediment to growth. Powell described the labor market as in \"quite a strong position\" and the consumer to be \"strong\" as well.", "description": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the central bank's pivot this year to lower interest rates has helped sustain U.S. economic growth.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106116664-1567793483545rts2pg65.jpg?v=1567793572", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
