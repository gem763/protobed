This is the third transaction in FY19 that furthers Takeda\u2019s strategy to focus on business areas core to its long-term growth and facilitate rapid deleveraging following its acquisition of Shire.\n\n\u201cThe divestment of non-core assets sold in NEMEA represents the continued execution of our strategy to optimize our portfolio, invest in the defined core business areas, and accelerate our progress toward reaching our target leverage ratio,\u201d said Costa Saroukos, Chief Financial Officer, Takeda.\n\nWhile these products continue to play important roles in meeting patient needs, they are primarily outside of Takeda\u2019s chosen business areas \u2013 Gastroenterology (GI), Rare Diseases, Plasma-Derived Therapies, Oncology and Neuroscience \u2013 core to its global long-term growth.\n\n\u201cTakeda remains committed to this region, as we continue our work in accelerating access to our life-changing portfolio of innovative products to meet the needs of patients. We will do this via our commercial activities and Takeda\u2019s Access to Medicines program,\u201d said Ricardo Marek, President, Growth and Emerging Markets Business Unit, Takeda. \u201cWe are confident that Acino is best positioned to provide uninterrupted access and supply of the divested products to patients.\u201d\n\nTakeda intends to use the proceeds from this divestiture to reduce debt and continue to deleverage towards its target of 2.0x net debt/adjusted EBITDA over the next three to five years. Takeda is committed to rapid deleveraging driven by strong cash flow and divestiture proceeds, while also simplifying its portfolio.\n\nTransaction Details\n\nTakeda has agreed to sell a portfolio of approximately 30 select prescription pharmaceutical and OTC products sold in the NEMEA region to Acino, a Swiss pharmaceutical company headquartered in Zurich, with a clear focus on selected markets in the Middle East, Africa, the CIS Region, and Latin America. The following key countries are included in the agreement: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates, as well as other countries.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Acino will acquire the rights, title, and interest to the products in the portfolio exclusive to these countries. It is anticipated that primarily sales and marketing professionals supporting the portfolio will transition to Acino at closing of the transaction. The parties will also enter into a multi-year manufacturing and supply agreement, under which Takeda will continue to manufacture the products on behalf of Acino.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in Q4 FY19 (January \u2013 March 2020), subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of applicable antitrust approvals. Until then, these products will continue to be made available by Takeda.\n\nTakeda is being advised by BofA Securities (financial advisor), White & Case (legal advisor), and Deloitte (financial consultant) in this transaction.\n\nAbout Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited\n\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE: TAK) is a global, values-based, R&D-driven biopharmaceutical leader headquartered in Japan, committed to bringing Better Health and a Brighter Future to patients by translating science into highly-innovative medicines.
