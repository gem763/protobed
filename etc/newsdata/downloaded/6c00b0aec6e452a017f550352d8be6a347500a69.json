(May 17) AP\n\nGina Rodriguez has come under fire after a controversial karaoke session.\n\nThe \"Jane the Virgin\" star posted a video of herself getting her hair and makeup done to her Instagram story Tuesday. In the now-deleted video, Rodriguez says the N-word while rapping along to the song \"Ready or Not\" by the hip-hop group the Fugees.\n\nHer post prompted backlash on Twitter, with many criticizing the 35-year-old for her casual use of the slur.\n\nRodriguez returned to her Instagram story to apologize in the hours after the original post.\n\n\"Hey, what's up everybody. I just wanted to reach out and apologize\" she said. \"I am sorry. I am sorry if I offended anyone by singing along to The Fugees, to a song I love, that I grew up on. I love Lauryn Hill, and I really am sorry if I offended you.\"\n\nBy the time Rodriguez had posted her apology, however, many had already taken to Twitter to slam the actress.\n\n\"gina rodriguez when her pr team calls her to tell her she posted the story on her main and not her finsta,\" one user wrote, along with a clip of the actress sobbing in her role as Jane Villanueva.\n\nMore: How Gina Rodriguez is crushing Hollywood: \u2018I\u2019m ready to not sleep'\n\ngina rodriguez when her pr team calls her to tell her she posted the story on her main and not her finsta pic.twitter.com/IP47jUcQIs \u2014 cin (@thorrbruce) October 15, 2019\n\n\"GINA RODRIGUEZ SAID THE N WORD ON HER INSTAGRAM LIVE WE GETTING HER OUT OF HERE,\" wrote another.\n\nGINA RODRIGUEZ SAID THE N WORD ON HER INSTAGRAM LIVE WE GETTING HER OUT OF HERE pic.twitter.com/3eg5MIMVcc \u2014 happy new year (@spiderverses) October 15, 2019\n\n\"gina rodriguez is about to pull this again after she sees we all called her anti black for saying the n word,\" another user wrote.\n\nMore: Gina Rodriguez says an emotional goodbye to 'Jane the Virgin': 'I will always love you'\n\ngina rodriguez is about to pull this again after she sees we all called her anti black for saying the n word pic.twitter.com/bD4UwPP12n \u2014 farah (@tiredfarah) October 15, 2019\n\n\"Can cancel culture come through for once and get Gina Rodriguez outta here,\" wrote another.\n\nCan cancel culture come through for once and get Gina Rodriguez outta here \u2014 If Beale Street Could Twerk (@camerouninema) October 15, 2019\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Rodriguez's rep for comment.\n\nRodriguez previously stirred backlash for comments she made about pay disparity during a 2018 Porter roundtable. Rodriguez said Latina women make less money than African American women and Asian American women.\n\nWhen asked about these remarks in an interview on \"Sway's Universe,\" Rodriguez fought back tears as she clarified her words.\n\n\"What I was saying was that when we talk about equal pay, we have to talk about intersectionality, because we all must rise,\" she said. \"The backlash was devastating to say the least because \u2026 the black community was the only community I looked towards. Growing up, we didn't have many Latino shows, and the black community made me feel like I was seen.\n\n\"So to get 'anti-black' is saying that I'm anti-family. My father is dark-skinned, he's Afro-Latino, and my cousins are, and Puerto Ricans are African, Ta\u00edno and Spaniard, and it's in my blood. So that was really devastating to me.\"\n\nShe added: \"I know my heart. I know what I meant, and I really wish that we weren't living in a culture where we're clickbait, because I have never said anything controversial about anybody and far would I ever, because, if anything, the black community is my community.\"\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nMore: Gina Rodriguez is married!
