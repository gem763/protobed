For a manager who has been called all the names under the sun and had his decisions questioned since he arrived, Bruce got it spot on here.\n\nSteve Bruce got his first win against Manchester United in 23 attempts on Sunday afternoon\n\n19-year-old Matty Longstaff repaid Bruce's faith by putting in a man of the match performance\n\nHe answered his critics the best way possible, by doing his talking on the pitch. It was his 23rd attempt at beating Manchester United as a manager and his first win.\n\nWhat a time to get it, too. A perfect response to what happened at the King Power Stadium. People will talk about the failings of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s United, but we have to applaud the men in black and white.\n\nThe fans were superb, too. I\u2019ve said all along it is extremely harsh to judge Bruce so early into his time at Newcastle. He needs time.\n\nThis win could see act as a foundation to build on. Newcastle\u2019s boss and their players will enjoy their international break a lot more now. They will be raring to go against Chelsea once the Premier League returns.", "description": "CHRIS SUTTON: After their horrific 5-0 loss to Leicester last week, Steve Bruce opted for a back three, and it delivered him a clean sheet, and he showed faith in Matty Longstaff who repaid it.", "authors": ["Chris Sutton For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/21/19371130-0-image-a-11_1570394809014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
