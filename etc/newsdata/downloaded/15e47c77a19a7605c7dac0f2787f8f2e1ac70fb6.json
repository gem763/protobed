(Photo: JANICE WEI, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe eruption of Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano has generated national headlines, but the event is unlikely to have a major impact on flight schedules.\n\nNo notable flight disruptions were being reported at the state\u2019s airports early Friday morning, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. FlightAware spokeswoman Sara Orsi said Friday that there were no current advisories related to ash.\n\nHonolulu-based carrier Hawaiian Airlines was waiving change fees for customers ticketed for flights from Thursday through Sunday at the airports serving Hilo and Kona. Both of those airports are on the Big Island where Kilauea is located, and it was possible that Hawaiian\u2019s move was geared more toward locals who might be affected by the eruption. The airline said its flight operations had not been disrupted.\n\nBeyond that, however, none of the biggest U.S. airlines that fly to the state have issued any advisories for travel to the state.\n\nUnited, one of the top carriers to Hawaii from the U.S. mainland, is seeing \u201cno impact at this time,\u201d according to spokesman Charles Hobart.\n\nARCHIVES: United's Boeing 747 farewell flight was one to remember\n\nIN PICTURES: 43 cool aviation pics: Boeing 747s to retro flight attendants to A380s\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rlcVQJ", "description": "The eruption of Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano has generated national headlines, but the event is not having a major impact on flight schedules.", "authors": ["Ben Mutzabaugh", "Published A.M.
