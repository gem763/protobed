Increased regulatory scrutiny is also a worry.\n\n\u201cOn the positive side AWS will most likely deliver strong growth and the advertising unit may surprise to the upside,\u201d Garnry told clients in a note.\n\nOpinion: Here\u2019s the stock-market trade this hedge-fund star is most excited about right now\n\nBut, he said, Amazon shares haven\u2019t hit a new high since the third quarter of 2018, which reflects increasing hesitation from investors about paying a 100% premium versus the overall equity market for the company.\n\nInvestor appetite for the shares, which closed Monday at $1,785.66, could ebb sooner rather than later, Garnry told MarketWatch in a follow-up chat. He advises watching for early warning signs of margin compression (when input costs rise faster that what the product earns) on AWS and slowing top line, or revenue, growth.\n\n\u201cI think currently Wall Street\u2019s estimates for 2020 and 2021 top-line growth are a little bit too optimistic, because it will be increasingly difficult to grow at this rate and the competitive landscape is changing,\u201d said Garnry.\n\nThe market\n\nSetting records looks like a stretch, with Dow YM00, +0.11%, S&P ES00, +0.19% and Nasdaq NQ00, +0.35% futures flat. In Europe, the FTSE 100 UKX, +0.74% is up and the pound GBPUSD, -0.4012% is down as the government pushes on with its Brexit plan.\n\nRead: FANMAG is in and it\u2019s a bubble, says this money manager\n\nThe chart\n\nOur chart of the day from hedge fund Crescat Capital\u2019s recently published quarterly letter highlights cracks it sees in the stock market. Crescat Capital notes that micro-cap stocks \u2014 via the Russell Microcap Index RUMIC, +1.35% \u2014 are down 20% relative to large-caps since September 2018.\n\n\u201cThey tend to be domestic-oriented businesses that have correlated strongly with the overall market throughout history.
