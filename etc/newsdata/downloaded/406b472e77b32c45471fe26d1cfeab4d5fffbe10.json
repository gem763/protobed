The Journal reported the most recent Fitch figures could underestimate the full degree of the shift toward state involvement.\n\nWhile President Xi Jinping has pledged \"unwavering\" support for private businesses, the government has strengthened its role in the sector in recent years.\n\nBut the stake purchases appeared to be an effort to stave off additional financial stress in the economy, according to the Journal. Private businesses, which account for about 60% of economic growth in China, have faced particular challenges in the face of a recent crackdown on unregulated lending.\n\nTrade tensions with the Trump administration have added to pressure on Chinese growth, which government figures showed expanded at its weakest pace since the early 1990's in the second quarter. The 6.2% figure was far below the double-digit increases seen over recent decades.\n\nNow read: US factory activity unexpectedly hits 10-year low as Trump's trade war persists\n\n\n\nRead more: Dan Fuss is revered as 'the Warren Buffett of bonds.'
