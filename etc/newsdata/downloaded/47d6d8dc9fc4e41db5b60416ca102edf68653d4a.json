It\u2019s an autoimmune disease\u2019\n\nYou Don\u2019t Look Sick: \u2018I don\u2019t have diabetes because of my diet. It\u2019s an autoimmune disease\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s time for You Don\u2019t Look Sick \u2013 our weekly series about living with an invisible illness or hidden disability.\n\nThis week, we\u2019re with Jade Byrne, 32, from Darlington, Co Durham, who has type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition where the body attacks the pancreas and it no longer produces insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar.\n\nThis is different from type two diabetes, which means the body still produces insulin but the body is resistant to it. Type 2 is often (though not always) caused by a bad diet and unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nType 1 diabetes, however, cannot be prevented and is not caused by diet \u2013 but often Jade faces judgement because people don\u2019t understand the condition.\n\nShe says: \u2018People will say things like \u201cBut you don\u2019t look diabetic\u201d I usually respond with \u201cand what does that look like?\u201d\n\n\u2018The response is usually, \u201cwell you\u2019re not fat\u201d. Type 1s are only 10% of all diabetics in the UK and so when we read about diabetes in the media, it\u2019s referring to type 2 diabetes, typically brought on by lifestyle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Type 1 diabetics come in all shapes and sizes but that has no relation to the fact we are Type 1 Diabetic. It\u2019s an autoimmune condition.\u2019\n\nJade has type 1 diabetes (Picture: Chris Booth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nLike with other invisible illnesses, Jade looks healthy on the outside and when she occasionally needs to use facilities like a priority seat or disabled bathroom, she has faced stares from strangers.\n\nShe explains: \u2018I had to ask for a seat on a very busy train recently because I was having a hypo (low blood sugar).\n\n\u2018Nobody said anything to me, but they were giving me looks. One man made me feel really uncomfortable. I know I shouldn\u2019t have let his ignorance get to me.\n\n\u2018I sometimes get a look coming out of a disabled toilet when I\u2019ve been changing my pump, but I just have to brush it off or just give them a really fake smile.\u2019\n\nJade was diagnosed at four years old after her mum read about the symptoms in an article and recognised that Jade had some of them, including drinking lots, weeing more often and feeling tired.\n\nJade has grown up with the condition and doesn\u2019t know any different but as she\u2019s got older, the technology used to control it has become much more advanced and has helped to improve her quality of life.\n\nJade showing her pump (Picture: Jade Byrne)\n\nShe explains: \u2018I wear a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and an Insulet Omnipod insulin pump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I always have two cannulas inside my body. These basically act as my pancreas, along with my mathematical skills.\n\n\u2018Before these devices, I would have to prick my fingers to know what my blood sugar level is and inject my insulin with an injection pen and work out the amount of insulin I needed myself.\n\n\u2018Now my phone always knows what my blood sugar is and alerts me when it\u2019s dropping.\n\n\u2018My personal diabetes monitor (PDM) works out my insulin dosage for me based on the amount of carbohydrates I tell it I\u2019ve eaten and the insulin to carb ratio that is programmed in for that specific time of day.\n\nJade with her pump that delivers insulin (Picture: Jade Byrne)\n\n\u2018The Omnipod also drip feeds me my background insulin instead of having to have another two injections a day for that, which I used to have to have.\u2019\n\nAlthough the CGM and pump help control blood sugar, Jade\u2019s life is still a huge balancing act, trying to work out exactly what she needs to keep everything within range.\n\nPoorly controlled type 1 diabetes can lead to low blood sugars (hypos) or hypers (high blood sugars) and if these are not corrected quickly, someone with diabetes can become seriously ill.\n\nIn the long term, poorly controlled type 1 diabetes can lead to circulation problems, blindness, kidney problems and increases the risk of developing other health conditions.\n\nJade needs to account for everything from stress levels, to the amount of exercise and even the weather to try to keep her blood sugar levels within range \u2013 4 mmol to 9mmol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe explains that even before she\u2019s left the house, she has already had a lot to consider: \u2018Each morning I wake up, see what my blood sugar is on my phone.\n\n\u2018If it seems a little high, as it often does first thing at the moment (hormones), I\u2019ll type my blood sugar into my PDM and my Omnipod pump will give me a correction dose of insulin. I get ready as any normal person would, my devices are waterproof so showering is fine.\n\nJade uses a pump and continuous glucose monitor to manage her condition (Picture: Jade Byrne)\n\n\u2018Then I\u2019ll get my kids up and we go downstairs for breakfast, I need to give myself insulin every time I have carbs and it\u2019s best if I give to myself about 15 minutes before I eat.\n\n\u2018This means working out, what I\u2019m eating and it\u2019s carb content, telling my pump my current blood sugar, by checking my phone, and also telling the PDM the amount of carbs I\u2019m going to eat.\n\n\u2018Before we leave the house for school, I need to check my phone to make sure my blood sugar is above 5mmol as you cannot legally drive a car in the UK if your blood sugar is below that.\n\n\u2018As long as I\u2019m above 5mmol, I\u2019ll then drop the kids at school, which can be stressful and cause issues with blood sugars dropping or sometimes even rising. It\u2019s quite an unpredictable condition.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJade works as an actor, writer and children\u2019s book author and the days where she is on stage mean she has to manage her condition slightly differently to the days she is at home.\n\nShe says: \u2018Every day is different for me as sometimes I\u2019m acting, which means my adrenaline is high.\n\nJade wrote her play Pricks about living with diabetes (Picture: Jade Byrne)\n\n\u2018This means I need to give myself more background insulin than usual as adrenaline sends your blood sugar up.\n\n\u2018If I\u2019m rehearsing I often need less background insulin as the adrenaline isn\u2019t there so much but I\u2019m using a lot of energy.\n\n\u2018When I\u2019m writing, I don\u2019t need to alter my background. Every day though, as long as my alarms don\u2019t beep to say my blood sugar is dropping or rising too high, I just need to check my blood sugar before I eat on my phone and then work out the carbs I\u2019ve eaten and tell my PDM all of this information and it gives me the correct insulin.\u2019\n\nAs a busy mum, running around after her kids can often cause her blood sugar to fall low.\n\nShe explains: \u2018When I pick the kids up from school, and run around like a headless chicken between all their activities, my blood sugar often drops and can drop quite quickly.\n\n\u2018If it drops below 3.5mmol, this is classed as a hypo and I need something sugary to get my blood sugar up.\n\nShe needs to change her canulas regularly and it can be messy (Picture: Jade Byrne)\n\n\u2018My favourite treatment is pineapple juice and then I need a more complex carb like crisps.\u2019\n\nJade\u2019s CGM also alerts her during the night if her blood sugars start to fall as it is essential that she wakes up and has something to eat.\n\n\u2018I often get woken up several times throughout the night though on a bad night as my body loves to surprise me with a night time hypo,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018This is why I got the Dexcom G6 because if I hypo in the night I miss a lot of my symptoms as I\u2019m asleep.\n\n\u2018With my Dexcom I get woken up by the alarms on my phone before I have an actual hypo, so I can treat it before it drops too low.\u2019\n\nAlthough diabetes is a treatable illness, it requires a lot of careful management and Jade knows to take each day as it comes.\n\nJade performing in Pricks (Picture: Jade Byrne)\n\nShe says: \u2018Every single day is different. I rarely have an entire day with blood sugars in range, in fact I don\u2019t know if I ever have.\n\n\u2018Everything affects your blood sugar level, the weather, stress, excitement, exercise, hormones, mood.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very hard to be a perfect type 1 diabetic and I am far from it. Sometimes, even after almost 30 years, I still forget that I am. I\u2019ll eat something and then feel a bit ill about half an hour afterwards and then I realise I\u2019ve forgotten to give myself insulin.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s totally relentless, but because as a Type 1, I\u2019m very strong and resilient, because you have to be, you wouldn\u2019t even realise I\u2019m doing all of this monitoring and maths.\n\n\u2018It certainly doesn\u2019t stop me doing anything, it can just make things a little more tricky. I may be knackered, but I still have a smile on my face.\u2019\n\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes Going to the toilet more \u2013 Your body will try to get rid of excess glucose through urination\n\nYour body will try to get rid of excess glucose through urination Being extremely thirsty \u2013 If you\u2019re going to the toilet more, you\u2019ll be very thirsty\n\nIf you\u2019re going to the toilet more, you\u2019ll be very thirsty Tiredness \u2013 Type 1 diabetes stops your body making the energy it needs, so you\u2019ll be exhausted\n\nType 1 diabetes stops your body making the energy it needs, so you\u2019ll be exhausted Weight loss \u2013 Your body has to get energy from somewhere, so will break down fat stores\n\nYour body has to get energy from somewhere, so will break down fat stores Fruity-smelling breath \u2013 If your body continues to operate like this, acid called ketones will build up. This will cause your breath to smell like pear drops, and can also lead to stomach pain. JDRF\n\nShe has a lot of support from friends, family and charities like the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund (JDRF).\n\nShe wrote a play called Pricks and during her research, she found lots of online support groups.\n\nShe says: \u2018I honestly think they are my best discovery. I am part of so many groups now and if I ever have a worry about anything, I drop a post in a group and I have a whole host of advice and support almost immediately.\n\n\u2018I had the best family and friends growing up and to be able to cope and deal with type 1 you need to have the best support around you, I was really lucky.\n\nIt really does wear on your mental health though and I find speaking to other type 1s the best for this, as they know it and they get it. They totally understand you.\n\nJade wants to raise awareness of diabetes and other invisible illnesses (Picture: Chris Booth for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018JDRF and DigiBete are also brilliant resources. They have so much content on their sites specifically to support people with Type 1 Diabetes.\n\n\u2018JDRF are very very close to my heart and are such an incredible little charity that have made wonderful advances in technology happen already with so much more in their pipeline.\u2019\n\nJade has had three tours of her show and it ran at Pleasance Courtyard Edinburgh Fringe 2018. She has three more tours planned.\n\nShe\u2019s also launching a children\u2019s book called Daisy Donald on World Diabetes Day 14 November with JDRF, with \u00a31 from the sale of each book going to the charity.\n\nDaisy Donald wears an invisible cape to fight an invisible illness. The illness is like a monster that she has to tame and sometimes even fight. It\u2019s revealed later in the book that the monster is type 1 Diabetes.\n\nHow to get involved with You Don't Look Sick You Don\u2019t Look Sick is Metro.co.uk\u2019s weekly series that discusses invisible illness and disabilities.
