Instead, the SAHRC halted its own inquiry, brought a case against him in the Equality Court and launched an aggressive media campaign against him, Etzebeth says in his affidavit.\n\n'Hidden agenda'\n\nThe rugby player reportedly accused the SAHRC of being biased and irrational, and of having a \"hidden agenda\".\n\nIn his court papers he says he believes the SAHRC folded under \"political pressure\" and was not \"brave enough\" to drop the investigation against him, instead taking the case to the Equality Court so that it would not have to make an \"unpopular\" finding.\n\nREAD | Nothing untoward about SAHRC representing Langebaan Four in Etzebeth case \u2013 Western Cape commissioner\n\nThe complainants allege they had been walking home from a local pub called the 5 O'Clock Sports Bar in Langebaan on August 25. On their way, they passed local hangout Die Watergat as Etzebeth and his friends were leaving.\n\nAccording to them, the rugby player asked the group: \"Wat soek julle h*tn*tte so laat op straat?\"\n\nA verbal exchange between the two groups ensued and Etzebeth and his party apparently got into their vehicles to leave.\n\nA brick or similar object was then thrown at his white Mustang and Etzebeth and his friends allegedly got out of their cars.\n\nAccording to the complainants' lawyer, Nigel Samuels, the group saw that Etzebeth had a firearm and fled.\n\n\"They caught Enver Wilsnach, who had been walking two women home, and hit him with the gun. Shiyaad Smith tried to intervene and he too was assaulted,\" Samuels claimed.\n\nDenied wrongdoing\n\nThe SAHRC confirmed meeting with Etzebeth who was included in South Africa's 31-man squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.\n\n\"The purpose of the meeting was to advise the player of the role the SAHRC takes in relation to a complaint received, as well as the subsequent media reports relating to it, and to establish a commitment of cooperation between the two parties,\" it said in a statement at the time.\n\n\"Both parties expressed their satisfaction with the envisaged process going forward, and concluded by describing the meeting as constructive.\n\n\"The player denied any wrongdoing to the SAHRC and has pledged his full cooperation in the matter.\"\n\nSAHRC chairperson Bongani Majola said on Monday that he was still in the process of perusing the court papers.\n\n- Compiled by Riaan Grobler", "description": "Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth has filed strongly worded court papers in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg, saying the case the South African Human Rights Commission brought against him in the Equality Court is \"unlawful\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2718/0a4a134c23da4d749e86775aa0ff700f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
