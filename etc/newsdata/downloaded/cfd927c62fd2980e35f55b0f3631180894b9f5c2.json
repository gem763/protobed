After 18 turbulent months, my husband had only recently moved out. Now, the words \u2018What were you thinking, Ulrika?\u2019 played on a loop inside my head as I wondered why I\u2019d agreed to this date.\n\nUlrika Jonsson met Paul (right) at the First Dates hotel in Naples following her third divorce\n\nSitting my teenage daughters down at the kitchen table a month before to ask how they\u2019d feel about me doing this had been nerve-racking enough \u2014 and not just because I was worried about a negative reaction.\n\nMy divorce from their father, Brian Monet, had yet to be finalised. But there was no going back. My feelings \u2014 and those of all four of my children, who loved him dearly \u2014 were incredibly raw.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, news of the end of my third marriage had only just been made public. Naturally, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what people might think about my role in its demise.\n\nBut I was single now and, therefore, free to go out with whoever I chose. However, as any woman in my position will attest, getting back in the dating saddle after any long-term relationship ends never feels quite that simple.\n\nHusband number one: Ukrika Jonsson married cameraman John Turnbull in 1990. The pair divorced after five years of marriage in 1995. Pictured at the premiere for Wayne's World 2\n\nI still had a married woman\u2019s mindset: faithful to the family Brian and I created. It would take more than divorce papers to free me of that.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, my 52nd birthday was looming and my confidence was at rock-bottom. I felt too old, too emotionally battered, for all the dressing-up and putting on a show \u2014 the very things I\u2019d enjoyed about it in my youth \u2014 that dating inevitably entails.\n\nThis low ebb manifested itself in fairly predictable ways. I wasn\u2019t sleeping well and I\u2019d lost all interest in my appearance.\n\nSchlepping around the house, always in the same frumpy uniform of leggings, vest top and loose, long-sleeved cardigan \u2014 all black \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel remotely attractive. So why on earth might anyone else see me that way?\n\nMeanwhile, my sense of self, not just as a person, but also as a sensuous being, was non-existent. \u2018Sex, how do you spell that?\u2019 I\u2019d joke with friends, having done the deed only once in the past eight years.\n\nPicturing myself across a restaurant table with someone new for the first time in 15 years, waiting to see if any sexual energy might ignite between us, felt beyond daunting. The thought of emotionally and physically interacting with another man in order to have sex with him filled me with terror.\n\nWhy, then, you might reasonably ask, was I putting myself through the stress of even considering a date \u2014 and a blind one at that, something I\u2019d never contemplated before \u2014 in the first place?\n\nHusband number two: Lance Gerrard Wright and Ulrika Jonsson married in Sweden on August 16, 2003\n\nActually, it was on the cards only because of my TV work. Recently, the producers of one of my favourite programmes, Channel 4\u2019s First Dates Hotel, had been in touch to ask if I\u2019d consider taking part.\n\nMy first instinct had been to laugh it off: \u2018I\u2019m getting divorced for the third time and you\u2019re asking me if I want to find someone new? Don\u2019t you see the irony?\u2019\n\nBut this was a celebrity version, part of the station\u2019s Stand Up To Cancer campaign. My fee would go to a brilliant cause, and maybe I\u2019d meet someone nice and we\u2019d have some fun in the process.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the format, the show takes people from all walks of life and attempts to match them on a perfect blind date.\n\nI\u2019m an incurable romantic and always find it delightful to watch. You feel a part of it all when some tiny (or big) flame is lit and hope tugs at the heart.\n\nAnd, of course, you also see the awkward moments when you just know things won\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nFirst Dates is set inside a UK restaurant and First Dates Hotel \u2014 the version I was invited on \u2014 outside Naples. As a viewer, it\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting at the next table, and no one minds you gawping.\n\nSo you can see why I was tempted. But, like any mother, my children\u2019s emotional needs came first.\n\nI had to give Bo, 18, and 15-year-old Martha the opportunity to say: \u2018Sorry, Mum, but we\u2019re not ready for you to do something like this.\u2019 Perhaps even for them to tell me: \u2018We don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for it, either.\u2019 Gosh, what a brilliant get-out that would have been.\n\nBut they said nothing of the sort. It was, the girls told me, a brilliant idea, a treat I deserved and needed. \u2018Just promise me something,\u2019 said Martha, her tone deadly serious. \u2018You\u2019ll dress up, no black, and you\u2019ll wear your hair down.\u2019\n\n\u2018And Mum,\u2019 added Bo, \u2018please put on some make-up.\u2019 This wasn\u2019t what I had expected to hear, but actually, it was just what I needed. Even so, I was shocked by their obvious excitement.\n\nI think they\u2019d seen their mum so sad over the past 18 months that they hoped this would be a nice change; that I\u2019d get away for a couple of nights and have fun.\n\nTheir enthusiasm buoyed me. In truth, it was far too soon even to think about looking for anyone new. I didn\u2019t feel remotely hopeful that I\u2019d find the next great love of my life.\n\nBut maybe it was time for me to start moving forwards \u2014 to do something outside of my comfort zone that might help me feel a bit better about myself.\n\nMy eldest son, Cameron, agreed with his sisters. I didn\u2019t talk it through with 11-year-old Malcolm, though \u2014 not least because the whole thing was top-secret and he can\u2019t keep his mouth shut.\n\nWhen I was going on Celebrity MasterChef, he blurted it out to a stranger at the checkout in Waitrose long before the line-up had been made public.\n\nHusband number three: Ulrika married Brian Monet in 2008. Pictured together in 2011\n\nMore important, he had been deeply affected by mine and Brian\u2019s split and I didn\u2019t want him to start worrying that I had plans to replace his daddy. As far as he was concerned, I simply had to go away for work.\n\nWhich, in theory, is all this was. But the reality of talking to the show\u2019s researchers about what I was looking for in a man made me realise I don\u2019t actually have a type.\n\nTheir questions \u2014 age, personality \u2014 stumped me. The men in my life have been so different: various ages, professions and looks.\n\nAll the relationships started from chance meetings or professional engagements. I met my first two husbands through work and Brian through friends in Sweden.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve never signed up to any kind of dating agency or even been on a blind date before. That\u2019s largely due to shyness and a romantic notion of letting serendipity play its part \u2014 that when love, or even uncomplicated sex, is meant to be, then it will somehow find you.\n\nI imagine that\u2019s how many women of my generation feel about modern dating, with first introductions so often taking place on the internet.\n\nAnd, while I don\u2019t usually play the celebrity card, for someone like me, that\u2019s an even harder landscape to navigate.\n\nThink about the practicalities of signing up for online dating when you\u2019re in the public eye. You can\u2019t put your real name, but using a false one would mean starting off any potential relationship with a lie.\n\nAnyway, imagine if I put up a real photo of me and the responses came back telling me I looked like an old has-been off the telly! Imagine the awkward explanations that would follow.\n\nBut then, I do have lots of friends who\u2019ve met their other halves through online dating \u2014 maybe it was worth taking a more calculated approach. There certainly wasn\u2019t going to be another chance to do it in such a protected environment.\n\nPushed for some guidance, on age range at least, I said: \u2018Oh, 25 to 50,\u2019 realising immediately that meant I could end up on a date with someone the same age as my oldest child. I needed to remember how old I was. But then, if I raised the age bar, they might set me up with someone in his 60s \u2014 horrifyingly, that would be more age-appropriate, but I just don\u2019t feel that old.\n\nIt could also make for a sensible and boring date, which was the last thing I needed. At least if they put me with someone super-young and inappropriate, it might be fun.\n\nFirst Dates' host Fred Sirieix in front of the Naple's hotel's sign. First Dates is set inside a UK restaurant and First Dates Hotel \u2014 the version I was invited on \u2014 outside Naples. As a viewer, it\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting at the next table, and no one minds you gawping\n\nThat\u2019s when it hit me that a sense of fun was what the breakdown of my marriage had taken from me. So I made another request: \u2018Please could I have someone funny?\u2019\n\nI hadn\u2019t shared a sense of humour with my ex-husband. Humour had been missing from my life for so long \u2014 I just wanted an evening of laughs. Oh, and if he could have an accent . . . that would be great.\n\nWhy? Because I love an accent on anyone. It starts the story of where you\u2019re from as soon as you speak. And, since they were pushing me for some prerequisites, I thought I might as well ask.\n\nThese conversations took place in April. I flew to Italy the following month.\n\nDuring the build-up, there was no time for nerves. I was too busy making arrangements to ensure everyone was OK at home. \u2018We\u2019ll be fine!\u2019 shrieked Bo when she caught me writing yet more instructions.\n\nOnly when I sat at my hotel room dressing table, my evening outfit hanging from the wardrobe door (a black dress, sorry Martha . . .) and the contents of my rarely used make-up bag spilling out in front of me, did the reality of what I was about to do hit me.\n\nPhysically, I wasn\u2019t feeling great. I had arrived with a sinus infection and now the nerves were kicking in.\n\nIn an hour, I would meet a complete stranger for dinner at a point in my life when I felt emotionally worn down.\n\nI\u2019d felt incredibly negative and hopeless for so long, with no idea about who or what might make me happy again. It occurred to me that I couldn\u2019t visualise myself with anyone else again.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t because I was still in love with my now ex-husband \u2014 I\u2019m not. It was more that I\u2019d been so concerned with looking after the children and helping them acclimatise to our new family status that I hadn\u2019t given my own happiness a second thought.\n\nEnding my marriage was what was needed to remove the misery from my life \u2014 but I hadn\u2019t yet worked out how to fill the space that had created.\n\nIf it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that, along with my date, there was a film crew waiting for me I think I\u2019d have caught the next flight home.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t an option, so \u2014 although I\u2019m not really a drinker \u2014 there was only one thing for it: a large rum and coke. And then I got ready for the date.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to watch the programme on Thursday night to find out how it went.\n\nWhat I will say is that his name is Paul, he\u2019s a few years younger than me, he has a lovely accent and we laughed like a pair of leaky drains all night. It was the most fun I\u2019ve had in a very long time.\n\nHe did a double take as he walked over. I offered him my cheek and introduced myself, and he laughed, saying: \u2018I know who you are.\u2019\n\nBut I didn\u2019t know his name, and I was on such pins and needles that I didn\u2019t dare ask for ages.\n\nThankfully, he seemed almost as nervous as I was, which helped.\n\nDid sparks fly? Did we meet each other again? You\u2019ll have to see for yourself.\n\nBut I\u2019m proud of myself for getting into the swing of the evening. Maybe it was down to the rum, but I soon managed to let go of all the angst and enjoy Paul\u2019s company.\n\nThere\u2019s no way I would have found myself on a blind date so soon if it wasn\u2019t for the show, and I\u2019m grateful for the way it gave me an unexpected kick up the bum.\n\nI hope any woman in a similar position will take heart from what I did. It\u2019s challenging, putting yourself out there again, but, as long as you don\u2019t have ridiculously high expectations, then dating again can be a really positive experience.\n\nWhatever the future holds, I\u2019ll never deliberately go looking for someone to \u2018complete\u2019 me. I feel strongly that my life is rich and full: I have my children, my friends and my dogs.\n\nBut, as the kids grow up, I will inevitably find myself alone. And, as I was reminded in Italy, it really is lovely to have someone to eat and laugh with.", "description": "ULRIKA JONSSON: This was my first date in 15 years.
