The World Health Organization also donated testing kits.\n\n\u201cUnless these quack doctors, barbers and dentists are not checked,the number of incidents of H.I.V. infection will continue going up,\u201d said Dr. Imran Akbar Arbani, a local doctor who had tipped off the authorities about the origin of the outbreak.\n\nThe Ratodero outbreak reflects a nationwide uptick in cases throughout the country, despite a decreasing worldwide infection rate, according to the Times.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2018, the number of HIV-positive people in Pakistan doubled to about 160,000, according to a fact sheet from UNAIDS\u2014 a United Nations task force dedicated to HIV and AIDS.\n\nDuring those years, the number of infections in the 15 to 24 age bracket increased 36 percent.", "description": "Nearly 900 children in a Pakistani city tested positive for HIV, according to a Saturday report from the New York Times.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Pakistan-Children-HIV-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
