The storm is next predicted to threaten Florida\u2019s east coast before barreling up the Southeast coast from Georgia to the Carolinas.\n\nThe North Carolina Outer Banks face a serious risk from Dorian later this week, and it\u2019s possible that the storm will brush Virginia Beach and the Delmarva area, including the Maryland and Delaware beaches.\n\n[Historic Hurricane Dorian unleashing \u2018catastrophic\u2019 blow in northern Bahamas, hurricane warnings posted for Florida\u2019s east coast]\n\nAt this point, there is only a small possibility that the storm will skirt the immediate Washington area, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ll need to watch as this track forecast comes into better focus.\n\nThe zone of greatest concern by far is from near Wilmington, N.C., to the Outer Banks, where forecast models show Dorian\u2019s center very close Thursday night into Friday. Conditions in this area could begin deteriorating as soon as early Thursday. If the storm makes a close pass, either making landfall in this zone or not far from it, dangerous hurricane conditions would be possible Thursday night and Friday.\n\nIn coastal North Carolina, major flooding could result from the storm surge, the storm-driven rise in ocean water above normally dry land. Five to 10 inches of rain could also fall, with winds exceeding hurricane force. The storm is projected to decrease in strength by the time it reaches the Mid-Atlantic \u2014 probably closer to Category 2 than 5.\n\nSome of these storm hazards could bleed into Virginia Beach and Delmarva, but it\u2019s unlikely that the center of the storm would come particularly close. Tropical-storm rather than hurricane conditions are possible, mainly on Friday.\n\nThe storm will be moving fairly quickly by the time it affects the Mid-Atlantic, so excessive rainfall and inland flooding probably will be limited compared with past storms such as Florence and Floyd.\n\nOf course, forecast specifics are highly dependent on the storm\u2019s course, and track forecasts have large errors this many days in advance. If Dorian tracks more to the east, even the North Carolina coast may be skirted while areas farther north receive little wind and rain. If it tracks more to the west, areas farther inland into the piedmont areas of North Carolina and Virginia, and the interior Delmarva, may briefly deal with tropical storm conditions.\n\nFor the immediate Washington area, the odds of much more than some gusty showers are small in almost any scenario, but if the storm tracks west, eastern areas near the Chesapeake Bay could see a short period of stormy weather.\n\nIrrespective of the exact track, beach erosion, rough surf, rip currents and at least minor coastal flooding will become a concern by the middle of the week at beaches.\n\nStay tuned for additional updates as the forecast becomes clearer.", "description": "At this point, there is only a small possibility the immediate Washington area is skirted by the storm, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ll need to watch.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "September At Pm", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
