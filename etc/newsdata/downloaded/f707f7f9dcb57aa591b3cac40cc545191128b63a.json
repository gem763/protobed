Green Bay has the momentum but must deal with the attrition of its wide receiver corps. Geronimo Allison was injured on a helmet-to-helmet hit by Lions safety Tracy Walker on an incompletion on the field goal drive. Allison was able to walk off the field on his own and was taken to the medical tent on the Packers\u2019 sideline. He later left the field and was taken to the locker room, presumably to be evaluated for a possible concussion. Walker was penalized on the play for an illegal hit to the head of a defenseless player. He did appear to be going for the ball rather than attempting to deliver a hit on the play. Wideout Marquez Valdes-Scantling returned to the game after being injured while blocking in the first half. (Lions 13, Packers 13 with 12:35 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHalftime at Lambeau Field: The Lions lead, 13-10, at halftime in Green Bay after the Packers got a 37-yard field goal by kicker Mason Crosby seven seconds before the intermission. The Packers had a first down at the Detroit 10-yard line but were pushed back by a holding penalty. Still, they have to feel fortunate to be so close after facing a 13-0 deficit that could have been larger.\n\nMatthew Stafford had 219 first-half passing yards for the Lions. He threw for 168 yards in the first quarter alone, with completions of 66 and 58 yards on the Lions\u2019 first two drives. But Detroit settled for two field goals among three early scoring opportunities. The Lions\u2019 touchdown came on a one-yard run by tailback Kerryon Johnson on a fourth-and-goal play after which the Lambeau Field crowd booed loudly, believing that Johnson had been stopped shy of the goal line by the Green Bay defense.\n\nThe Packers struggled to get going. Tailback Aaron Jones lost a fumble and dropped what should have been an easy touchdown catch. Tight Jimmy Graham dropped a potential touchdown catch on the same drive as Jones\u2019s drop. But the Lions extended that Packers\u2019 drive with two penalties, one of them for having too many men on the field as Green Bay lined up for a field-goal attempt. Running back Jamaal Williams scored a five-yard touchdown on a tap pass by Aaron Rodgers to finish that eventful drive, then had a 45-yard run to set up Crosby\u2019s field goal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne ominous development for the Packers came when wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling was injured while blocking on a running play late in the half. Green Bay already is shorthanded at receiver with Davante Adams out with a toe injury. (Lions 13, Packers 10 at halftime)\n\n2nd Quarter\n\nPackers get on board: The Packers, somehow, are back in this game. They\u2019ve been dominated so far by the Lions. They dropped two would-be touchdown passes before finally scoring a touchdown on this 14-play drive. But the Lions certainly did their part to get Green Bay back in contention with two key penalties to extend the drive. The Lions were called for defensive holding following a third-down incompletion thrown by Aaron Rodgers, then were penalized for having too many players on the field as the Packers lined up for a field goal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGreen Bay took advantage with a five-yard touchdown by running back Jamaal Williams on a forward tap pass by Rodgers. Earlier on the drive, tailback Aaron Jones dropped what should have been a 33-yard touchdown pass by Rodgers on a play on which he was wide open and Rodgers made an on-target throw. Tight end Jimmy Graham dropped what would have been a more difficult touchdown catch later in the drive. No matter. The Packers are within six points. (Lions 13, Packers 7 with 7:31 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nLions get another FG: The Lions added to their lead but could end regretting the field goals they\u2019ve gotten instead of touchdowns on two of their first-half opportunities. They reached the Green Bay 2-yard line but couldn\u2019t get into the end zone. Tight end T.J. Hockenson nearly made a touchdown catch on a second-down lob from Matthew Stafford on a fade pattern. But Hockenson couldn\u2019t hold onto the football as he landed on the ground. After a delay-of-game penalty on the Lions, an offside penalty on the Packers and a third-down incompletion thrown by Stafford, Detroit got a 22-yard field goal by kicker Matt Prater. It\u2019s very early in the second quarter and Stafford already has 194 passing yards. (Lions 13, Packers 0 with 13:28 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\n1st Quarter\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPackers lose fumble: This is not going well so far for the Packers. They had a decent drive going but tailback Aaron Jones lost a fumble. The Lions take possession and will try to add to their lead. (Lions 10, Packers 0 with 3:30 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nLions get fourth-down TD (maybe): Matthew Stafford made it two long completions in two Detroit possessions, and this time the Lions cashed in with a one-yard touchdown run by tailback Kerryon Johnson on fourth and goal. The crowd at Lambeau Field booed the touchdown ruling loudly, believing that the Green Bay defense stopped Johnson short of the goal line on the fourth-down play. It was very close. One official along the goal line signaled touchdown, while another official on the other side of the play seemed to indicate that Johnson had been stopped shy of the end zone. The officials, after a brief conference, signaled touchdown, and there was no reversal on replay. It was not clear with the pileup of bodies whether Johnson managed to get the football to the goal line or not. Earlier, Stafford connected on a 58-yard pass to wideout Marvin Hall. Stafford has completions of 66 and 58 yards already and the Lions have a quick 10-point lead. (Lions 10, Packers 0 with 6:35 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nEarly trickery by Lions: The Lions were extremely aggressive \u2014 and extremely successful \u2014 with a trick play on their opening snap. On a flea flicker, Matthew Stafford connected with wide receiver Kenny Golladay for a 66-yard pass play to the Green Bay 11-yard line. It wasn\u2019t as dazzling from there, as the Lions settled for a 26-yard field goal by kicker Matt Prater. (Lions 3, Packers 0 with 12:41 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPreview\n\nThe NFC North is shaping up as a rugged division and two of its contenders, the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions, square off Monday night at Lambeau Field.\n\nThe Packers have put themselves in the conversation about the NFC\u2019s best team with a fast start under their first-year head coach, Matt LaFleur. They\u2019ll try to improve their record to 5-1, which would join the New Orleans Saints and Seattle Seahawks at a half-game behind the 5-0 San Francisco 49ers in the conference standings.\n\nLaFleur was hired to replace Mike McCarthy because he\u2019s a young, would-be offensive mastermind in the mold of his former Los Angeles Rams boss, Sean McVay. But so far, the Packers are winning not because LaFleur has gotten the most out of quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the offense. They\u2019re winning because they\u2019ve been a better all-around team and not so heavily reliant upon Rodgers to mask deficiencies in other areas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLions at Packers\n\nWhen: Monday at 8:15 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis.\n\nTV: ESPN\n\nStreaming: fuboTV\n\nLaFleur retained defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, the former head coach of the Cleveland Browns, and Pettine has overseen the league\u2019s eighth-ranked scoring defense. The Packers have 15 sacks in five games, led by 5.5 by Preston Smith and five by fellow newcomer Za\u2019Darius Smith. The defense might have to lead the way again Monday, since Rodgers will be without wide receiver Davante Adams, who has been ruled out because of a toe injury. Rodgers had only four completions to wide receivers when the Packers won at Dallas eight days ago.\n\nAD\n\nThe Lions have played surprisingly well, with a record of 2-1-1. They\u2019re coming off a bye week that followed their first loss of the season, a 34-30 defeat Sept. 29 to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAD\n\nMatt Patricia, the former New England Patriots defensive coordinator, is getting improved results in his second year as Detroit\u2019s head coach after the Lions went 6-10 last season.\n\nThe Lions are struggling this season on defense. They\u2019re ranked 27th in the NFL in total defense and 29th against the pass. But the offense is thriving. The Lions are ranked eighth in the league in total offense, and quarterback Matthew Stafford has nine touchdown passes, two interceptions and a passer rating of 102.6 through four games.\n\nAD\n\nThe NFC North is the only division in the NFL that has all four teams with winning records. The Minnesota Vikings beat the Philadelphia Eagles Sunday to improve to 4-2, while the Chicago Bears, who are on a bye this week, are 3-2.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nJohn Clayton: These five NFL contenders are at risk of missing the playoffs", "description": "It\u2019s shaping up as a rugged division and two of its contenders square off at Lambeau Field.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Vb36-1BeA-HHa5GGRFUAP-PUeUI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4CD7JAXO4YI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
