Still, the world needed to take \u201cstrong and firm action to deter Iran\u201d or see further escalations, the prince said in an interview for CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday.\n\nOnly a fool would attack 5 per cent of global supplies Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman\n\nThe U.S., Saudi Arabia and major European nations have all blamed Iran for the Sept. 14 aerial attacks on two Saudi oil installations, which knocked out almost 5 per cent of global supply.\n\nBut after weighing their possible responses, President Donald Trump opted first to tighten sanctions on Tehran, while the U.K., Germany and France have pushed for talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nIran denies it carried out the strikes, saying they were the work of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels who are fighting a Saudi-led coalition.\n\nTogether with apparent efforts to build on a fledgling peace process in Yemen, the international moves have eased fears that the Middle East was sliding toward another catastrophic war.\n\nFavors Talks\n\n\u201c[The attacks] disrupted 5.5% of the world\u2019s energy needs, the needs of the U.S. and China and the whole world,\u201d the Saudi crown prince says about the recent attack on two Saudi oil facilities https://t.co/BiRpnXSxPU pic.twitter.com/fBCzGhyQlJ \u2014 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) September 30, 2019\n\n\u201cIf Iran stops its support of the Houthi militia, the political solution will be much easier,\u201d the prince said. \u201cToday we open all initiatives for a political solution in Yemen.\u201d\n\nThe oil facility attacks were motivated by \u201cstupidity,\u201d the prince said. \u201cThere is no strategic goal. Only a fool would attack 5 per cent of global supplies.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s in favour of Trump and Rouhani holding face-to-face talks. Trump \u2014 who won the White House vowing to remove the U.S. from wars overseas and faces re-election next year \u2014 had talked up the possibility of meeting Rouhani until the attack on Saudi oil fields.\n\nIran has repeatedly said it won\u2019t negotiate with the U.S until it returns to the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal that Trump existed last year and lifts all sanctions.\n\nThe war in Yemen has killed thousands and triggered one the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters since Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in 2015 to restore an allied government ousted by the Houthis.\n\nThe U.A.E. has signalled it will pull its forces from the conflict by the end of the year as the war threatened to ignite a catastrophic wider conflict with Iran. Last week, a Yemeni official said the Saudis had agreed a partial cease-fire.\n\nOn the murder of government critic and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi last year, Prince Mohammed said he took \u201cfull responsibility.\u201d Asked how he could have been unaware of the operation, he said he can\u2019t know \u201cwhat 3 million people working for the Saudi government do daily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a mistake,\u201d the prince said. \u201cAnd I must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future.\u201d\n\nThe question of the prince\u2019s role in the murder has particularly weighed on the kingdom\u2019s relations with the U.S., a key ally. Trump has shielded the prince even as Congress condemned Saudi Arabia.\n\nPrince Mohammed first spoke publicly about the killing in October last year at an investor conference in Riyadh, calling it a \u201cheinous crime\u201d and promising that the killers would be brought to justice.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "'Only a fool would attack 5% of global supplies'", "authors": ["Hailey Waller", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/mohammad-bin-salman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
