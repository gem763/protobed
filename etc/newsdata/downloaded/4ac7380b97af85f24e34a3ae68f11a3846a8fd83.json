Minnie Hill speaks lovingly about her daughter, \u201ca beautiful personality,\u201d killed while living as a single mother in Florida.\n\nAuthorities say Rosie Hill was one of scores of vulnerable women preyed upon by Samuel Little, declared by the FBI this week as the deadliest serial killer in U.S. history.\n\n\u201cHe was nothing but the devil,\u201d Minnie Hill told The Associated Press. \u201cWho knows of a person that killed that many people? What did she do so bad for him to kill her at the time her baby was but 2 years old?\u201d\n\nLittle, who has been convicted of eight slayings in California, Texas and Ohio, has confessed to 93 killings across the country between 1970 and 2005, recounting the crimes in astonishing detail. Police have confirmed 50 cases after a Texas Ranger opened a floodgate of confessions more than a year ago, and the FBI this week released disturbing video interviews, hoping to solve additional cold cases.\n\nSerial killer experts say Little\u2019s confessions came from a desire for notoriety. \u201cHe\u2019s proud of his work. He\u2019s not sad or feeling guilty. He sees himself as a killer. That\u2019s his identity,\u201d said Marina Sorochinski, an investigative psychology researcher at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \u201cVictim closure, he couldn\u2019t care less about that. It\u2019s about him, getting attention.\u201d\n\nStill, Minnie Hill, now 79, says she forgives Little, because \u201cI have to, for God to forgive me, because I do wrong and God forgives me.\u201d\n\nAuthorities say Rosie Hill\u2019s body was discovered in a wooded area next to a pig pen in Florida\u2019s Marion County in August 1982. Authorities said the 20-year-old was strangled or suffocated. Investigators questioned Little at the time, but didn\u2019t have enough evidence to charge him then.\n\nLast fall, after Texas authorities began tying Little to murders around the country, Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Detective Sgt. Michael Mongeluzzo joined police from several states who flew to Texas to bring closure to cold cases. The sheriff\u2019s office said: \u201cLittle confessed to killing Rosie Hill and dumping her body.\u201d\n\nMinnie Hill says Mongeluzzo later told her that Little said during the interrogation that Rosie \u201cwas a big fighter, but I won the fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle was able to prey upon women who were in a vulnerable state,\u201d said Bryanna Fox, a criminology professor at the University of South Florida. \u201cHe picked the women and gained their trust, then he would kill them, and no one would report they were missing.\u201d\n\nIn this March 4, 2013, file photo, Samuel Little appears at Superior Court in Los Angeles. Little, pronounced by the FBI the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history, has confessed to more than 90 slayings committed across the country between 1970 and 2005. Damian Dovarganes\u2014AP\n\nRosie Hill grew up in the Memphis area. She became pregnant during high school and moved to Florida to live with her grandparents and give birth to her daughter. She later moved to Ocala.\n\nMinnie Hill says her daughter called her Aug. 4, 1982. They spoke again four days later. Rosie delivered an ominous message. \u201cShe said, \u2018Mother, I\u2019m up into something, but I can\u2019t get out of it unless I leave from here. So, I\u2019ll be home the weekend,'\u201d Hill said.\n\nBut Rosie Hill was reported missing on Aug. 12, Minnie Hill said. She and her husband went down to Florida. \u201cDidn\u2019t nobody know anything,\u201d she said.\n\nThen, a call came that the morgue had her daughter. But Minnie Hill had her doubts about the identification, she said, when she learned the body was decomposed to the point where it was mostly bones and hair. \u201cFor two years I waited to hear a phone call from her, maybe she\u2019ll come home. She never did,\u201d she said.\n\nHill had trouble sleeping and she remembers lunging for the phone every time it rang, hoping it was her fun-loving daughter who loved children, cooking, dancing and the church. But no news came. Hill resigned herself to the knowledge that her daughter was gone.\n\nHill says investigators suggested her daughter had worked as a prostitute. Minnie Hill said that could have explained Rosie Hill\u2019s statements to her that she was \u201cinto something.\u201d But it was one of many half-clues and disappointing leads into a case that went nowhere \u2014 until last year.\n\nMinnie Hill still lives in the working-class neighborhood where she raised her daughter, and later her orphaned granddaughter. She holds closely to the memories of her daughter \u2014 the picture owns a prominent place in her living room. She described her daughter as well-behaved in school and a good student.\n\n\u201cShe got along with just about everybody,\u201d Minnie Hill said. \u201cShe always kept us laughing and cutting up. She used to love to dance. Sometimes we\u2019d just be sitting around, have music on, she\u2019d be the clown.\u201d\n\nMinnie Hill laments the fact that Little wasn\u2019t stopped sooner. \u201cMaybe somebody\u2019s life would have been saved.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Rosie Hill was one of scores of women murdered by Samuel Little, declared this week as the deadliest serial killer in U.S. history.", "authors": ["Adrian Sainz", "Tamara Lush"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/samuel-little-serial-killer-victims.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
