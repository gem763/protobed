Shea/Getty Images\n\nLater this evening and into early Monday storms will slide over into the Ohio Valley and the interior northeast but will likely lose some moisture and coverage with the loss of daytime heating.\n\nThen on Monday night into early Tuesday, it appears the cold front will tap into just enough heat and moisture to bring a round of storms to the northeast U.S.\n\nWhile the chances of severe thunderstorms remains isolated, gusty winds and locally heavy downpours appear likely in the major metro areas Monday night and early Tuesday.\n\nLocally over 4 inches of rain will fall in parts of the Midwest through today from this system, especially in areas of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nMeanwhile, Tropical Storm Karen has formed in the Atlantic and could impact Puerto Rico on Tuesday as new Tropical Strom Warnings have been issued in the Caribbean.\n\nA new tropical Storm warning has been issued for portions of the Windward Islands, including Trindiad and Tobago. Karen currently has winds of 40 mph and is moving West Northwest at 9MPH.\n\nKaren is expected to bring heavy rainfall and gusty winds to parts of the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, over the next few days.\n\nAlthough some overnight models are beginning to indicate that this tropical wave could become a system worth monitoring later this week, it remains too early to determine how this system will evolve in the long term.", "description": "Over 9 inches of rain has hit parts of the Northeastern Plains as a cold front sweeps across the Central states.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/flooding-gty-er-190922_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
