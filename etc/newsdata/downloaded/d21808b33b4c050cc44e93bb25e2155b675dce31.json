But many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is steadily eroding that autonomy.\n\nWeeks of protests over a now withdrawn extradition bill have evolved into a broader backlash against the government and greater calls for democracy.\n\nAt Hong Kong\u2019s main stadium on Tuesday night, a sizeable contingent of the crowd of more than 10,000 football fans jeered and held up \u201cboo\u201d signs as China\u2019s anthem played before the game, while others chanted \u201cRevolution of our time\u201d and \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d. Disrespecting the national anthem is an offence in China.\n\nOther fans sang \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d a song that has become a rallying cry for more democratic freedoms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\n\u201cWe hope we can unite Hong Kong,\u201d said one of those booing, Ah Wing, wearing a red Hong Kong team shirt and glasses. \u201cEven if we lose, we\u2019ll keep going. That\u2019s what we do against strong teams, against strong enemies.\u201d\n\nSome local fans continued to chant protest slogans during the match, which saw Iran beat Hong Kong 2-0.\n\nRelated Coverage China angered after German foreign minister meets HK activist\n\n\u201cBLACK HANDS\u201d\n\nDuring a rally at the U.S. consulate on Sunday, thousands of demonstrators, some waving the American flag, called for help in bringing democracy to Hong Kong.\n\nThe protesters urged the U.S. Congress to pass proposed legislation that would require Washington to make an annual assessment of whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous from mainland China to retain special U.S. trade and economic benefits.\n\nA bipartisan group of senior U.S. senators stepped up the pressure on Tuesday by writing to the U.S. State and Commerce Departments asking them to assess U.S. export rules for Hong Kong and expressing concern about China\u2019s potential acquisition of sensitive U.S. technologies via the special treatment Hong Kong is allowed.\n\nThe lawmakers also expressed concern about whether current export control laws allowed U.S. persons to \u201cinappropriately\u201d export police equipment to Hong Kong that could be used to suppress dissent.\n\nLam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, responded to those calls at a news conference on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely inappropriate for foreign parliaments to interfere in HKSAR internal affairs in any way, and (we) will not allow (the United States) to become a stakeholder in HKSAR matters,\u201d she said, referring to Hong Kong by its status as a special administrative region of China.\n\nChina denies meddling in the city and Chinese officials have accused foreign forces of trying to hurt Beijing by creating chaos in Hong Kong. They have also warned outsiders to keep out of what they call an internal matter.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, asked about the protests in front of the U.S. Consulate and Lam\u2019s comments, said Beijing was resolutely opposed to any foreign government interfering in China\u2019s affairs.\n\n\u201cWe hope they can withdraw their black hands in Hong Kong as soon as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nThe sometimes violent demonstrations have taken a toll on Hong Kong\u2019s economy, which is on the verge of its first recession in a decade. Hong Kong visitor arrivals plunged nearly 40% in August from a year earlier.\n\nSoccer fans hold signs in support of anti-government protesters at a football World Cup qualifier match between Hong Kong and Iran, at Hong Kong Stadium, China September 10, 2019.
