But they deny that Dhillon was the cause of their financial meltdown.\n\nDhillon, a relative of the Singhs\u2019 mother, has not commented on the brothers\u2019 troubles.\n\nThe Singhs were forced out of Religare and Fortis in 2018 and said in a statement to the Business Today magazine one year ago that they had sold virtually all their shares and assets to pay off debts.\n\nHuge claims remain however and many of their remaining assets are under court control.\n\nDaiichi Sankyo won a $500 million compensation order against the brothers at an international tribunal in Singapore in 2016 after claiming that they had withheld key information during the sale of Ranbaxy.\n\nIndia ranks third in the world for the number of family owned conglomerates, behind China and the United States, according to a recent Credit Suisse report.\n\nConflicts are common within the families. But Business Today said: \u201cSuch decimation of a flourishing and diversified empire within a decade is unprecedented in India\u2019s corporate history.\u201d", "description": "Mumbai (AFP) \u2013 Tycoon brothers Shivinder and Malvinder Singh appeared in court Friday accused of siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/e36b1a_brothers-shivinder-malvinder-singh-are-lost-worth-billions-decade-high-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
