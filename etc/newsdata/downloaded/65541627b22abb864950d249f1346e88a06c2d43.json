He has a statutory duty to ensure that he gets the best value from assets for creditors.\u201d\n\nKPMG, one of the accountancy firms assisting with the liquidation of Thomas Cook, said earlier this month that all of the failed travel operator\u2019s shops had been purchased by Hays Travel, the country\u2019s largest independent travel agent.\n\nREAD MORE: Up to 2,500 jobs saved as Hays Travel buys 555 Thomas Cook shops\n\nHow much Hays Travel paid for the shops had not been disclosed until now.\n\n\u201cThey bought 555 shops. \u00a36m is not a lot of money,\u201d said Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, a member of the Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) select committee.\n\nBeale said that the length of the leases of each store varied \u2014 and that some of the stores were \u201crelatively small\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe assessment of the official receiver was that this was a good deal,\u201d Beale said.\n\nThomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest travel operator, collapsed into administration in September, leaving 150,000 holidaymakers stranded and putting 9,000 jobs in the UK at risk.\n\nREAD MORE: Accountancy firms clock up \u00a311m bill for Thomas Cook liquidation\n\nBut the sale of the stores to Hays Travel was billed as a move that could save as many as 2,500 jobs.\n\n\u201cIt provides re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former Thomas Cook employees, and secures the future of retail sites up and down the UK high street,\u201d said Jim Tucker, a KPMG partner, earlier this month.\n\nIn addition to its own stores, Hays Travel runs a consortium of independent travel agents, as well as Just Go Travel, a subsidiary that primarily operates in the North West of England.\n\nThe firm was founded in 1980 in Durham, and rapidly expanded across the UK in the 1990s. In the 12 months to the end of October 2018, the company hit \u00a31bn in revenue for the first time.", "description": "The travel firm paid just over \u00a36m in total for all 555 shops sold as part of the liquidation of Thomas Cook.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LvFwb2URlRoAdOENsCYfsA--~B/aD0xOTM5O3c9Mjc5NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/bd39cf70-ea70-11e9-bdff-dfdca95da315", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
