Quick work strategically placing hose lines inside the structure led to a rapid knockdown of the flames, as shown in attached still photo taken shortly afterwards. pic.twitter.com/Ok5VweWyGH \u2014 DC Fire and EMS (@dcfireems) September 3, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Fire breaks out in 4-story apartment house.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png"}
