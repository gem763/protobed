Plasma-derived therapies are in demand and there are indications that more diseases could benefit. However, in biotech you should never discount competition. Today, CSL has a market capitalisation of $114 billion and generates $2 billion in profits. Its market position is well understood, but I am not sure investors fully comprehend how the market dynamics could change with the approval of competing products.\n\nWhen was the last time you heard from a biotech and had a lightbulb moment?\n\nI hate to disappoint you, but the best ideas are usually those that are the opposite of the lightbulb moment. Many people tell me \u201cwe are the leader\u201d in this and that and they show us beautifully laid-out concepts, but inevitably, reality is more complex. In fact, the ideas that are not that easy to comprehend initially, are the ones we tend to investigate. Science is never black and white; it is a puzzle that gets more interesting with every piece you put together.\n\nWhat do you think is the most exciting stock in your portfolio?\n\nI like companies that have challenges ahead of them but are not afraid to invest sensibly.\n\nJapanese Pharmaceutical company, Daiichi Sankyo is one of our investments that is currently playing out. We have held the company for some time, as we were impressed by its antibody-drug conjugation technology and oncology team.\n\nMost people were focused on its patent expiration. It took a little while for the market to realise the potential of its antibody platform, but earlier this year, AstraZeneca came on board as a partner, and the first drug-conjugated antibody is now rapidly approaching commercialisation. This is very significant for Daiichi Sankyo, as it catapults the company into the global oncology scene.\n\nHow long do you think the market will give the new Sanofi CEO to reset the strategy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sure Paul Hudson will have done his homework prior to accepting the CEO role at Sanofi, so at the R &D day in December he should be in a position to share his thoughts with investors. Changing a company is never a one-person job, so we are also closely watching his lieutenants. John Reed (head of R &D) has been with Sanofi for over a year now and hence he should have a much clearer idea of how he could reinvigorate the engine. We are looking forward to the R &D day.\n\nWe're always looking for new, or old, TV shows to stream. What's caught your eye?\n\nI have been watching Mayans M.C., a show about a biker gang at the Mexican border to the US. It is co-produced by Kurt Sutter who develops characters and script very well. The show draws out the socioeconomic, cultural and political issues in that part of the world from a range of interesting angles, the main being through the internal workings of a local Southern Californian MC, a Mexican drug cartel (in change management) and also a local family dealing with some significant secrets. It can be a bit raw at times, but the character development and entertaining narrative makes up for it. It can be surprisingly quite light hearted at times.\n\nFinally, a recommendation for the readers on a good value quick bite in Sydney.\n\nThe Butchers Block in Wahroonga is a good one. It is a bit of \u2018inner city in Wahroonga\u2019. Great coffee and nice food. Our St Bernard dog, Eiger, can happily sit outside and enjoy the attention.", "description": "AFR Markets Live checks in with Platinum's Bianca Ogden about valuing CSL with a global perspective, and why she's excited about Daiichi Sankyo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3639%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_371%2C$y_48/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d7320d98030ee70de31ccccb46dd69884144cae0", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
