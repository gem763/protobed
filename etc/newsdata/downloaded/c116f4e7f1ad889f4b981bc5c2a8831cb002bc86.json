REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The British government on Wednesday announced two competitions that will award a total of about 140 million pounds ($180 million) to industrial decarbonization projects as part of efforts to help the UK achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe competitions aim to help support projects to decarbonize industry, such as carbon capture and hydrogen power, and boost plans to establish the world\u2019s first net zero industrial cluster, or group of similar and related firms in a specific geographic area, by 2040.\n\nThe UK in June passed laws requiring greenhouse gas emissions, about a quarter of which are produced by industry, to be cut to net zero by 2050 as part of attempts to tackle climate change.\n\nIn the first competition, businesses can apply for a share of up to 1 million pounds to develop plans for decarbonizing an industrial cluster.\n\nSuccessful applicants will then compete in a second phase where up to 131 million pounds will be awarded for projects which deliver or support significant emissions reductions in an industrial cluster by 2030.\n\nIn the second competition, UK organizations can apply for a share of up to 1 million pounds to prepare plans for achieving low-carbon and net zero industrial clusters.\n\nThen, up to 8 million pounds will be awarded for the development of decarbonization plans or roadmaps for major UK industrial clusters.\n\nBoth competitions close on Dec. 4.", "description": "The British government on Wednesday announced two competitions that will award a total of about 140 million pounds ($180 million) to industrial decarbonization projects as part of efforts to help the UK achieve net zero emissions by 2050.", "authors": ["Nina Chestney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446559439&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1AC", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
