REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nShares in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) rose 4.4% and were among the top gainers on the S&P 500 .SPX after the lender named banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer.\n\nThe news boosted the bank sub-sector .SPXBK, which rose 1.43%, while the broader financial sector was up 0.65%.\n\nThe chip sector, however, came under pressure after Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) tumbled 9.8% and drove a 1.2% fall in Philadelphia semiconductor index .SOX.\n\nUpbeat comments on trade from China\u2019s foreign minister Wang Yi offset some of the shock from the launching of an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and helped stem losses in late Thursday session.\n\nMarkets now await high-level trade talks between Washington and Beijing next month.\n\nYet analysts and traders say the volatility of the day-to-day messages from both sides in a conflict that dates back over a year has left investors with little faith that a full-scale resolution is in prospect any time soon.\n\n\u201cCould we get a positive headline on trade? Yes. But it will be optics at best,\u201d said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. \u201cI don\u2019t expect anything that happens before the elections to be a comprehensive deal.\u201d\n\nAt 10:12 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 26.83 points, or 0.10%, at 26,917.95 and the S&P 500 .SPX was down 2.66 points, or 0.09%, at 2,974.96. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 30.05 points, or 0.37%, at 8,000.62.\n\nAll three main indexes are set to end the week slightly lower.\n\nData showed U.S. consumer spending barely rose in August, suggesting that the economy\u2019s main growth engine was slowing after accelerating sharply in the second quarter.\n\nNew orders for key U.S.-made capital goods also unexpectedly fell in August but the so-called core PCE price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose to 1.8% in August, the biggest rise in prices since January.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.05-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 10 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 14 new highs and 51 new lows.", "description": "The S&P 500 and Nasdaq slipped on Friday, pulled lower by a slide in Micron shares after the chipmaker blamed U.S.-China trade tensions for its downbeat first-quarter profit forecast, but gains in financials kept the Dow in positive territory.", "authors": ["Ambar Warrick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434534685&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0UI", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
