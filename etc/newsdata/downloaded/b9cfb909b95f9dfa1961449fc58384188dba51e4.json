(AP) - Seth Brown\u2019s legs practically flew around the bases he had so much Adrenalin and energy.\n\nThe Oakland rookie could see and hear his teammates going crazy.\n\nBrown hit his second RBI triple of the game to break a sixth-inning tie in a special home debut, Matt Chapman had a three-run homer, and the Athletics beat the Los Angeles Angels 7-5 on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIt was fantastic tonight. It\u2019s hard to describe,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt was my first time in the Coliseum tonight, so it was just an unbelievable moment and an unbelievable night. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nBrown followed Mark Canha\u2019s single in the sixth with the go-ahead hit off loser Noe Ramirez (4-3). Brown\u2019s first triple came in the second, and he tied Oakland\u2019s single-game record that has been done 12 times. Chapman hit two triples on July 26, 2018, at Texas.\n\nBrown is batting .448 with nine RBIs in eight games since being called up by the A\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI think the thing that impresses me the most is how confident he is. He\u2019s pretty tenacious,\u201d manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cFor a guy that first comes to the big leagues, a lot of times you don\u2019t see that.\u201d\n\nAlbert Pujols hit his 654th career home run leading off the fourth, moving the 39-year-old slugger within six of Hall of Famer Willie Mays (660) for fifth on the all-time list.\n\nMike Trout hit his 44th homer in the first for the Angels, tying Cody Bellinger of the Dodgers and Pete Alonso of the Mets for the majors\u2019 lead.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you I\u2019m going up there trying to hit a homer. It just happens,\u201d Trout said. \u201cBut I\u2019m definitely aware of where the other guys are at. I\u2019m obviously pulling for them. So I think it\u2019s pretty cool down the stretch.\u201d\n\nAndrelton Simmons added an RBI single in the second against Mike Fiers, who has won 11 consecutive decisions spanning 21 starts dating to a May 7 no-hitter against the Reds but didn\u2019t factor into the decision.\n\nJustin Upton hit a tying homer in the top of the sixth against Blake Treinen after Chapman connected for his 31st homer in the third. Yusmeiro Petit (5-3) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the win and Liam Hendriks finished for his 18th save after blowing a chance against the Yankees to lose Sunday in the Bronx.\n\nKhris Davis had two RBIs, one on a groundout and a sacrifice fly in the sixth for an insurance run.\n\nFiers struck out four over five innings, allowing four runs, seven hits and two walks. With his next start he will match his career-high of 30 done three times previously.\n\nAngels two-way star Shohei Ohtani returned to starting at designated hitter and went 1 for 4 with a double and two strikeouts after coming off the bench Saturday and Sunday and spending some extra time taking swings in the cage.\n\nROAD WOES\n\nThe Angels dropped to 3-14 over their last 17 road games.\n\nAt 65-74, Los Angeles is nine games below .500 for the first time since finishing the 2016 season at 74-88.\n\nUPCOMING DEBUT\n\nA\u2019s catching prospect Sean Murphy, a third-round pick in the 2016 draft out of Wright State, is scheduled to make his major league debut before the series ends. Melvin said Murphy would either start behind the plate Wednesday night or during Thursday afternoon\u2019s finale.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAngels: If RHP Justin Anderson (right upper trap strain) continues to make progress he will pitch in a simulated game as soon as Friday, when the Angels open a weekend series against the White Sox in Chicago. \u2026 All-Star INF Tommy La Stella, recovering from a broken tibia in his right leg, could join the Angels in Chicago even if he might not be quite ready to come off the injured list, manager Brad Ausmus said. \u2026 Los Angeles recalled C Anthony Bemboom from Triple-A Salt Lake.\n\nAthletics: CF Ramon Laureano, nearly back from a stress reaction in his lower right leg, took live batting practice on the field for the first time and said the last four times he has done running work it has been at full speed. Laureano considers himself fully healthy and ready to return, and manager Bob Melvin said that will happen this weekend against the Tigers. When Laureano returns, Canha will return to RF and Melvin plans to pick a left fielder based on matchups. \u2026 RF Stephen Piscotty (right ankle) is yet to begin baseball activities in his latest rehab.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Patrick Sandoval (0-1, 5.24 ERA) faces the A\u2019s for the first time in his career coming off five scoreless innings with a career-best nine strikeouts his last time out, a no-decision vs. Texas. Oakland counters with RHP Tanner Roark (2-1, 3.30), making his sixth start for the A\u2019s since being acquired from the Reds at the trade deadline.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Seth Brown's legs practically flew around the bases he had so much Adrenalin and energy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/angels_athletics_baseball_43905_c0-79-4487-2695_s1770x1032.jpg?c4205022152a0747cd9f9e77b0ac240a0754dbf7"}
