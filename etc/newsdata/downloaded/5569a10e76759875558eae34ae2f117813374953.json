(Photo by Nicholas Kamm/AFP)\n\nThe Campaign\n\nHOLLYWOOD BUZZ: Bob Iger keeps saying he\u2019s not interested in running for president. At least, not anymore.\n\nBut there\u2019s still a small but influential push in Hollywood to get the Disney CEO to change his mind, according to two entertainment executives.\n\nThey see him as a successful \u2014 and likable \u2014 businessman who could actually take on President Trump. And be a more appealing alternative than some of the far-left populists now dominating the Democratic primary \u2014 especially as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), starts leading in some polls.\n\nSplit screen: \u201cHe\u2019s a smooth guy, the right age, a supersmart team builder,\u201d one senior television executive told Power Up. \u201cAnd put him up against Trump? Bob ran a G-rated corporation and took it to new heights.\u201d\n\none senior television executive told Power Up. \u201cAnd put him up against Trump? Bob ran a G-rated corporation and took it to new heights.\u201d \u201cDemocrats are a train wreck,\u201d the executive said. \u201cThe second Warren goes up in the polls \u2014 no one in corporate America will vote for her.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s so far no public quest to solicit donations or support, the talk has created so much buzz in Hollywood that it keeps forcing Iger to address the topic in recent interviews, appearances, and awards ceremonies.\n\nWhile being honored at a gala for Save the Children earlier this month: \"Iger, who recently revealed that he\u2019s had conversations with former President Barack Obama and his family about a potential run, joked upon taking the stage, 'Oprah, I am reminded of something that Ronald Reagan said to Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential debate, \u2018There you go again,\u2019\" Variety's Ashley Hume writes. \"Please, I am not about to become the 25th or the 30th person seeking the presidency in 2020.\" (Iger did not respond to Power Up's request for comment.)\n\nOprah has taken the pressure campaign public: \u201cIf Bob Iger had decided to run for president, I would be canvassing in Iowa right now,\u201d Winfrey told Iger to his face in an interview on her OWN channel last month. \u201cI would be going door to door. More than ever, every day, I wish you had done it.\u201d\n\nThis is the man I wish was running for President of the USA. His decency prevails in all decision making. His 10 steps for leadership revealed in his new book #RideOfALifetime apply to every business and every life. pic.twitter.com/yOzOy8kQxi \u2014 Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) September 28, 2019\n\nShe\u2019s been talking about this \u2014 loudly \u2014 for more than a year. \u201cUm, I'd have been happy to be in his cabinet,\u201d she told Vogue last spring. She \u201creally, really pushed him to run for president\u201d \u2014 and even offered to \u201cgo sit and have tea with people\u201d to convince them to vote.\n\nIger has said his inner sense of patriotism initially led him to consider running for the high office. \"I am horrified at the state of politics in America today,\" he told Vogue last April.\n\nA centrist?: \"I, maybe a bit naively, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201d\n\n\"I, maybe a bit naively, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and Ultimately, Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, which prolonged his stay at the company until 2021, prompted him to rule out a presidential bid. (Though he did admit to playing coy with Rupert Murdoch, telling the Fox mogul he wasn't considering running -- when he actually was, Maureen Down wrote in The New York Times last month.)\n\n(Though he did admit to playing coy with Rupert Murdoch, telling the Fox mogul he wasn't considering running -- when he actually was, Maureen Down wrote in The New York Times last month.) Another big deterrent: \"Aside from [his wife Willow] Bay\u2019s reluctance, Mr. Iger doubted that the Democrats would support a successful business person,\" Dowd writes. \u201cI think the Democratic Party would brand me as just another rich guy who\u2019s out of touch with America who doesn\u2019t have any sense for what\u2019s good for the plight of the people,\" Iger told Dowd.\n\nBut Iger still seems to be egging on some speculation in the way he answers questions about a possible run.\n\nDuring an appearance this month on Jimmy Kimmel Live to promote his new book: \"Kimmel asked Iger about Winfrey's recent comments, to which Iger responded, 'I will run for president if you also join Oprah,'\" AOL's Jennifer Kline writes.\n\n\"Kimmel asked Iger about Winfrey's recent comments, to which Iger responded, 'I will run for president if you also join Oprah,'\" AOL's Jennifer Kline writes. \"Iger, 68, has rarely, if ever, appeared on late night TV, but he's currently promoting his new memoir, 'The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company.' All of the book's proceeds will go toward educational initiatives,\" Kline writes. \"It's perhaps worth noting that just about all presidential candidates publish memoirs before entering the race.\"\n\nIger recently laid out what his 2020 message would be \u2014 if he were running: At The Atlantic Festival in Washington, Iger told Laurene Powell Jobs last month that \u201cAmerica is gravely in need of optimism, of looking at the future and believing that so many things are going to be all right, or that we as a nation can attack some of the most critical problems of our day. And that could be the environment, that could be income disparity, that could be the technology\u2019s impact on the world from a disruption perspective. It could be the cost of education, availability of affordable housing, healthcare. You name it.\"\n\nAt The Atlantic Festival in Washington, Iger told Laurene Powell Jobs last month that \u201cAmerica is gravely in need of optimism, of looking at the future and believing that so many things are going to be all right, or that we as a nation can attack some of the most critical problems of our day. And that could be the environment, that could be income disparity, that could be the technology\u2019s impact on the world from a disruption perspective. It could be the cost of education, availability of affordable housing, healthcare. You name it.\" And Iger, in his new book, wrote that he consulted with \"former members of the Obama administration, some members of Congress, pollsters and fundraisers, and staff from previous campaigns,\u201d per Deadline\u2019s Ted Johnson . \u201cHe even studied \u2018like crazy\u2019 on a variety of pressing issues, and read past great presidential speeches.\"\n\nWhy Hollywood wants him to run anyway: Iger's personal story is compelling, as the sources who want him to run pointed out to Power Up.\n\n\u201cI am very lucky. I was a lower middle class kid or middle class. My father had manic depression so he had trouble holding a job. I started as a $150-a-week employee at ABC 45 years ago and rose up to be CEO of this company. It is a great story, but it is not necessarily because I was extraordinary,\u201d he told Powell Jobs.\n\nIger has also spoken out against Trump: Iger left the president's Advisory Council after the administration withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord and criticized his decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nBut not on everything: But he's also But he's also seemed to come out in support of Trump's tax reform that provided a lower tax rate for corporations. He provided Disney employees with a one time cash bonus of $1,000 after the law was enacted.\n\nOprah is not the only boldfaced name who has spoken on the record about Iger. Jeffrey Katzenberg, a cofounder of DreamWorks SKG, former Disney chairman himself and a major Democratic donor, said this past April that he \"begged\" Iger to run for president.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much I begged Bob... he just wasn\u2019t willing to run for president of the United States,\" Katzenberg said while presenting Iger an award at the Simon Wisenthal Center Humanitarian Awards ceremony.\n\nKatzenberg said while presenting Iger an award at the Simon Wisenthal Center Humanitarian Awards ceremony. \"Is it too late?\" actress Jennifer Garner said when asked this month if she would hand Iger the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cI dare to say he is presidential. He\u2019s dignified, he\u2019s a risk-taker, he is down to earth, he is wise, and he has integrity.\"\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter. Not a regular subscriber?\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. (Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nAt The White House\n\nMULVANEY SAYS THE QUIET PART OUT LOUD: Our colleague Toluse Olorunnipa reports on how acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney turned the press briefing room into \"a sort of confession chamber\" for nearly 40 minutes, \"openly admitting to several acts that could deepen the legal predicament for the president.\" He confirmed that Trump withheld security aid to Ukraine because he wanted an investigation of Democrats and the Democratic National Committee's computer server -- and that it was the Trump himself who suggested his Doral resort be considered to host the G-7 summit.\n\nHe answered affirmatively when asked if there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine. \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThis is part of a trend: \u201cIn admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet \u2014 and potentially illegal \u2014 part out loud,\u201d Toluse writes.\n\n\u201cIn admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet \u2014 and potentially illegal \u2014 part out loud,\u201d Toluse writes. But not everyone was pleased: Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal attorney, later said in a statement: \u201cThe President\u2019s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing.\u201d And the Justice Department official added, \u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.\u201d\n\nJay Sekulow, Trump's personal attorney, later said in a statement: \u201cThe President\u2019s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing.\u201d And the Justice Department official added, \u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.\u201d Key quote: \u201cHe literally said the thing the president and everyone else said did not happen,\u201d one unnamed GOP lawmaker told our colleague about Mulvaney's apparent admission of a quid-pro-quo.\n\nClean up, clean up: As frustration with him mounted, the White House released an official statement from Mulvaney \u201cblaming the media for misconstruing his words \u201cto advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,\u201d our colleagues Karoun Demirjian and John Hudson report.\n\nAll in plain sight today: Trump awards major global summit to his own golf resort in Miami; WH chief of staff admits aid to Ukraine held up for Trump political ends (\"Get over it.\") EU ambassador testifies was told by Trump to take orders on US-Ukraine relationship from Giuliani. \u2014 Greg Miller (@gregpmiller) October 17, 2019\n\nAT THE TOP OF THE NOTEPAD: Power Up asked our Post colleague and Pulitzer-prize winner David Fahrenthold, who has spent years now investigating and reporting on Trump's business ties, to take us through the decision to host the G-7 at the Doral -- what may be president's boldest move yet when it comes to mixing official and personal business.\n\nThe announcement is unparalleled, as David writes: \u201cThe move by Trump is unprecedented in modern American history: in effect, the president awarded an enormous federal contract to himself, in secret. The decision will bring hundreds of diplomats, media and security personnel to Trump\u2019s financially struggling resort at one of the leanest times of its year: June, when Miami gets hot and tourists stay away. The hotel reported just 38 percent occupancy in June 2017. Now, of course, it will be full.\u201d\n\nHere's want David says he still wants to know:\n\nWhat other sites did the government consider? If they considered only other sites with obvious flaws, it could seem like the fix was in for Doral. What will the Trump Organization charge Trump\u2019s government (and foreign governments) for rooms and food? Will the Trump Organization ask the U.S. government to pay for upgrades? One obvious problem: they\u2019ve got eight world leaders coming, and only two presidential suites.\n\nAND RICK PERRY RESIGNS: \"Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified President Donald Trump on Thursday that he\u2019ll leave the post this year,\" Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs, Jenny Leonard, and Ari Natter scooped. Trump later made it official at a rally in Texas.\n\nWait a minute: Perry's possible departure as been reported as far back as April. The New York Times's Maggie Haberman summed it up perfectly as \"longest goodbye in Trumpland.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence speaks during a news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after their meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Ankara, Turkey. (Burhan Ozbilici/AP)\n\nGlobal Power\n\nA CEASE FIRE IN SYRIA: Turkey agreed \"to a cease-fire that would suspend its march into Syria and temporarily halt a week of vicious fighting with Kurdish forces, while allowing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government to carve out a long-coveted buffer zone far beyond its borders,\" our colleagues Kareem Fahim, Karen DeYoung and Seung Min Kim report.\n\nAlmost everything Erdogan wants: The agreement \"appeared to hand Turkey\u2019s leader most of what he sought when his military launched an assault on northeastern Syria just over a week ago: the expulsion of Syrian Kurdish militias from the border and the removal of a U.S. threat to impose sanctions on Turkey\u2019s vulnerable economy,\" our colleagues write. Pence added that the sanctions imposed earlier this week would be withdrawn once \u201ca permanent cease-fire was in effect.\"\n\nA look inside the room: As Vice President Pence met with Erdogan, \"the two men refused to smile, even a little, as their meeting got underway, as if to communicate failure before their negotiation had begun,\" our colleagues write. \"But afterward, a Turkish official briefed by participants in the talks said the Turkish side was surprised and relieved at how easy the negotiations were.\"\n\nAs Vice President Pence met with Erdogan, \"the two men refused to smile, even a little, as their meeting got underway, as if to communicate failure before their negotiation had begun,\" our colleagues write. \"But afterward, a Turkish official briefed by participants in the talks said the Turkish side was surprised and relieved at how easy the negotiations were.\" Key quote: \u201cWe got everything we wanted,\u201d the Turkish official told our colleagues.\n\nthe Turkish official told our colleagues. The most important detail: The agreement does not require a Turkish withdrawal.\n\nBACK AT HOME: Democrats and some Republican lawmakers torched the agreement. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said the deal \"is far from a victory\" and added \"serious questions remain about how the decision was reached precipitously to withdraw from Syria and why that decision was reached.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it a \"sham cease fire\": \"President Erdogan has given up nothing, and President Trump has given him everything,\" they said in a statement. \"The Turks have stated that \u2018this is not a ceasefire,\u2019 and made clear that they \u2018will pause the operation for 120 hours in order for the terrorists to leave\u2019 \u2013 referring to the courageous Kurdish fighters who have suffered nearly 11,000 casualties in our fight to defeat ISIS.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump continued to celebrate the temporary cease-fire at his rally in Dallas last night: He argued \"it had been wise for him to allow Turkish forces to invade and attack Kurds because 'sometimes you have to let them fight a little while,'\" our colleagues Phil Rucker and Jenna Johnson report.\n\n\u201cLike two kids in a lot, you\u2019ve got to let them fight and then you pull them apart,\u201d Trump said. He marveled at the fighting, saying \u201cit was pretty vicious,\u201d and adding, \u201cIt was nasty. \u2026 It\u2019s not fun having bullets going all over the place.\u201d\n\nOn The Hill\n\nTHE LEGACY OF ELIJAH CUMMINGS: \"Elijah E. Cummings, a Democratic congressman from Maryland who gained national attention for his principled stands on politically charged issues in the House, his calming effect on anti-police riots in Baltimore, and his forceful opposition to the presidency of Donald Trump, died Oct. 17 at a hospice center in Baltimore. He was 68,\" our colleague Jenna Portnoy writes.\n\nPK chronicles Cummings incredible rise: \"His parents were sharecroppers in South Carolina, toiling on the same land where their ancestors had served as slaves. In the 1940s, they moved to Baltimore and raised seven children, sending young Elijah to special-education classes because he struggled in elementary school,\" our colleague Paul Kane writes. \"About 60 years later \u2014 after becoming an honors student at Howard University, serving 14 years in the Maryland General Assembly, winning a special election in 1996 to the U.S. House \u2014 Cummings could scare the president of the United States.\"\n\nOn why Cummings didn't run for the Senate: \"Maryland had never elected a black senator, and Cummings had a good sense of his chances to win,\" Paul writes. \"But he sometimes responded to inquiries by asking whether someone knew the average life expectancy of a black man in America. It was about 69 years old, the age Cummings would have turned in January.\"\n\nMore from his former colleagues:\n\n\u201cHe would always just calm the waters,\u201d Pelosi recalled.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many friends would call me and be in fear because they got a letter from Cummings. But he was a man of fairness,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said during tributes on the House floor.\n\nFrom former Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) who tussled with Cummings over the House's Benghazi investigation:\n\nHis legacy is making sure there were fewer obstacles for the next Elijah Cummings. His legacy to me, above all else, was his faith. A faith in God that is being rewarded today with no more fights, no more battles, and no more pain. \u2014 Trey Gowdy (@TGowdySC) October 17, 2019\n\nA view from Maryland: Power Up asked Erin Cox, who covers Maryland state politics for The Post, what she'll remember most. \"Congressman Cummings had a scar above his eye, left there from a bottle thrown at him when he was a child trying to integrate a Baltimore public pool,\" she writes. \"It always struck me that Maryland\u2019s most beloved politician was physically marked by its ugliness, and he dedicated his life to figuring out how to make the state better for children who came behind him.\"\n\nAnd from Baltimore specifically: \"As this city has endured a litany of political and police corruption scandals in recent years, Cummings distinguished himself as the rare local leader whom many residents felt they could still trust,\" our colleague Paul Schwartzman writes. \"During crises, he had the capacity to express the city\u2019s anguish with eloquence and passion, his presence a measure of reassurance to many who worried that chaos was overwhelming Baltimore.\"\n\nAmbassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland arriving at the Capitol. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nThe Investigations\n\nSONDLAND TESTIFIES ALL ROADS LEAD TO RUDY: \u201cDuring nearly nine hours of testimony, [E.U. Ambassador Gordon] Sondland said he reluctantly indulged what he described as the president\u2019s efforts to run Ukraine policy through his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani,\u201d Politico's Andrew Desiderio and Kyle Cheney report. \u201cHe indicated that he opposed Trump\u2019s orders to reach out to Giuliani, who was pushing the Ukrainian government to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\u201d\n\nThe knives are also starting to come out: \u201cI would not, on my dime, send a private attorney looking for some server in a foreign country,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a close Trump ally, told Politico, adding that \u201cthe question a lot of us are trying to grapple with\u201d is whether Giuliani\u2019s actions were appropriate.\n\nViral\n\nMATTIS GOES THERE: Former Defense Secretary James Mattis let loose on Trump at the Al Smith dinner last night. \u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield ... and Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d Mattis joked. More from The Asssociated Press's Tim McElroy here.\n\n\"I\u2019m not just an overrated general. I\u2019m the most overrated general,\" Mattis says. \"I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress.
