The state\u2019s former governor has warned Trump and his fellow Republicans that \u201cthe blood is on your soul\u201d... for denying climate change.\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s burning while the deniers make a joke out of the standards that protect us all. The blood is on your soul here and I hope you wake up,\u201d former governor Jerry Brown snarled, during a House Oversight Committee hearing on the Trump administration\u2019s recent decision to bar California from setting its own auto emissions standards. \u201cThis is not politics, this is life, this is morality\u2026this is real,\u201d he continued.\n\nClimate change is real, it\u2019s happening, and you and everyone else will recognize that.\n\nBrown likened Trump and his fellow climate change skeptics to believers in \u201cflat Earth,\u201d claiming climate change is directly responsible for the wildfires currently engulfing swathes of California. While at least two of this year\u2019s fires are actually believed to have been caused by malfunctioning PG&E power lines - like last year\u2019s devastating Camp Fire, which wiped out an entire town - Brown has glossed over the notoriously mismanaged utility to pin the blame on hotter, drier weather. The only solution? \u201cLimiting our carbon pollution,\u201d he told reporters in 2015, defying climate scientists who suggested that that year\u2019s fires were not caused by anything of the sort.\n\nAlso on rt.com California nightmare: Insult to injury as fires and power cuts turn Golden State into dystopia\n\nThe House called Brown and other \u201cexperts\u201d to testify against the White House\u2019s decision to quash the waiver that had allowed California to set its own vehicle emissions standards and effectively control the whole country\u2019s auto industry. Car companies can hardly afford to manufacture two separate versions of the same vehicle, and California has more drivers than any other state, so they can\u2019t ignore the stricter emissions rules either.\n\nDemocrats, including current California governor Gavin Newsom, have slammed the move as \u201creckless and politically motivated,\u201d a symbol of Big Oil\u2019s iron grip on the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators. The White House, however, has claimed that stricter emissions standards make vehicles more expensive, meaning fewer people will drive these energy-efficient cars. The rule change is due to take effect next month.\n\nAlso on rt.com First it was the cow farts, now asthmatic patients are killing the environment, says new study\n\nLike this story?
