Tell the truth!\u201d and \u201cShame on Boris\u201d, and the protesters played bursts of music that included the EU\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy\u201d anthem and \u201cI can\u2019t get no satisfaction\u201d.\n\nJohnson was due to address journalists alongside Bettel in the courtyard after their meeting but left straight away, saying later that it wouldn\u2019t have been fair on the Luxembourg prime minister to hold a news conference amid a din of protests.\n\nWith less than seven weeks until Britain is due to leave the EU, Johnson has yet to reach an agreement with Brussels on how to manage the separation between the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and its biggest trading partner.\n\n\u201cSTOP SPEAKING - ACT\u201d\n\nJohnson is hoping a Brexit deal can be clinched at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18.\n\n\u201cYes, there is a good chance of a deal, yes I can see the shape of it, everybody can see roughly what could be done,\u201d he told reporters after his Luxembourg meetings.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson shakes hands with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker during a meeting in Luxembourg, September 16, 2019. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nHowever, the European Commission said London had still not proposed an alternative to the Irish backstop that has stymied a deal on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, giving a more downbeat read-out of the meeting between Juncker and Johnson.\n\nJohnson reiterated that Britain would leave the European Union on its Oct. 31 divorce date, deal or no deal, and would not request a delay.\n\nHowever, his office said it had been agreed at the Luxembourg lunch that talks to find a deal would intensify.\n\nNegotiations would be raised to a political level - between EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Britain\u2019s Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay - from the technical-level talks of recent weeks, and meetings would take place daily.\n\nThe future of the land border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland is the central issue of disagreement both between Johnson and the EU and between him and British lawmakers. Britain\u2019s parliament three times rejected a deal negotiated by his predecessor Theresa May which included the so-called backstop mechanism to keep the border open.\n\nJuncker told Johnson over lunch that he must present workable proposals to replace the Brexit backstop.\n\n\u201cPresident Juncker recalled that it is the UK\u2019s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d the European Commission said in a statement, referring to the deal struck by May. \u201cSuch proposals have not yet been made.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nBettel took a harsher line in his remarks after escorting Johnson out, urging the British prime minister to \u201cstop speaking and act\u201d and to stop trying to pass the blame to the EU for the consequences of a decision taken by the British people in the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\n\u201cOur people need to know what is going to happen to them in six weeks time. They need clarity, they need certainty and they need stability. You can\u2019t hold their future hostage for party political gains,\u201d he said to applause and loud cheers from the protesters.\n\n\u201cSo now it\u2019s on Mr Johnson, he holds the future of all the UK citizens and every EU citizen living in the UK in his hands. It\u2019s his responsibility. Your people, our people count on you. But the clock is ticking - use your time wisely.\u201d", "description": "Britain's Boris Johnson said on Monday that a Brexit deal was beginning to emerge, but the EU said he offered nothing to break the impasse during a visit to Luxembourg where he was harangued loudly by protesters and rebuked for trying to shift the blame.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430410813&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0NV", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
