The date will be rearranged for March 26th 2020, and I promise I will deliver the show you deserve. Thank you so much for your support and understanding.\"\n\nJohn's next scheduled show is Oct. 28 in Nashville.\n\nIt's been a tough week for the singer. His mother-in-law, Gladys Furnish, died on Oct. 24.\n\nJohn's husband, David Furnish, wrote on Instagram, \"Today I lost my beautiful, angelic Mother. She passed away peacefully in the middle of the night, with me and my brothers by her side.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Rest in peace Mum. You lived your life impeccably. I will never forget you. I promise to do my best to pass the gifts you gave to me on to my own beautiful sons.\"", "description": "The performer was forced to reschedule his performance Indianapolis due to illness.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/elton-john-file-gty-ml-191028_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
