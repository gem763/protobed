They said their actions were an attempt to manage the interests of borrowers, savers and shareholders who relied on their dividends for income.\n\nAnalysts have said bank profits would be hurt by falling interest rates, with each 25 basis point reduction shaving about 5 per cent off bank profits.\n\nNet interest income\n\nAnalysis by Evans & Partners suggested the annual net interest income of Australia\u2019s big banks would fall by $8.2 billion if interest rates were to remain low for an extended period.\n\nThe fall in interest income, they said, would lower the return on equity of the banks and threaten the sustainability of bank dividends, which have become highly coveted as interest rates have fallen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe RBA acknowledged that the fall in official interest rates would crimp bank profits. This is because an increasing proportion of deposits already pay close to zero interest rates, which cannot be reduced further in line with low rates.\n\nBut it said Australia\u2019s banks were far better placed than their foreign peers to withstand the profit hit from ultra-low rates.\n\n\u2018\u2018Most deposits in Australia currently receive interest well in excess of zero, so the extent of pressure on margins from these deposits will be smaller than in many other countries.\u2019\u2019\n\nMr Frydenberg said it was \u2018\u2018disappointing\u2019\u2019 that the big four banks had not passed on the RBA\u2019s 25 basis point cut in full.\n\nHe said funding costs for the banks were at historic low levels and customers could \u2018\u2018vote with their feet\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2018We encourage people to shop around and get the best possible deal.\u2019\u2019\n\nOpposition Leader Anthony Albanese called on the government to \u2018\u2018exert leverage over the big banks\u2019\u2019 by imposing sanctions to encourage them to \u2018\u2018do the right thing\u2019\u2019.\n\n'Doing the wrong thing'\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018We also have the case that the government could simply, instead of just advertising things to advance its political interests, how about they spend a bit of that advertising dollar on actually saying to the big four banks that they\u2019re doing the wrong thing, and enhancing the reputation of those smaller financial institutions that have passed on the full amount.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Financial Stability Review, published every six months, seeks to identify risks posed to the Australian financial system, such as external shocks, household debt levels and changing economic conditions.\n\nThe report is the first since the shock May election result that sparked a recovery in the housing market. Risks from falling house prices had reduced, the RBA said, but \u2018\u2018still exist\u2019\u2019 due to high vacancy rates and the potential for an oversupply of apartments in Sydney.\n\n\u2018\u2018The cuts to the cash rate, and the resulting reductions in borrowing rates, have contributed to a turnaround in some established housing markets.\u2019\u2019\n\nA change in lending standards, the Reserve Bank said, had led to an improvement in the asset quality of the banks.\n\nIt said it was important that banks were not overly cautious.\n\n\u2018\u2018Lending always entails a degree of risk but excessive risk aversion by financial institutions can curtail the provision of credit that facilitates economic growth.\u2019\u2019", "description": "The Reserve Bank has endorsed the health of the big four banks, ruling out a European style profit squeeze from ultra-low interest rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2463%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_9/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/059a907cf965dd5149b4bf066c376eebd7800caf", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
