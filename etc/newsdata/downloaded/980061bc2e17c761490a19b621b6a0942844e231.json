The whistleblower alleges that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter for their connections to a Ukrainian oil company. Hunter sits on the company's board of directors.\n\nDear Colleague,\n\nOn Thursday, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire will appear before the House Intelligence Committee in an open hearing. At that time, we expect him to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower\u2019s full complaint to the Committee. We also expect that he will establish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law.\n\nThe Intelligence Community Inspector General, who was appointed by President Trump, has determined that the complaint is both of \u201curgent concern and credible,\u201d and its disclosure \u201crelates to one of the most significant and important of the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe Administration\u2019s blocking of Acting DNI Maguire from providing Congress with the whistleblower complaint calls upon him to violate the federal statute, which unequivocally states that the DNI \u201cshall\u201d provide Congress this information. The Administration is endangering our national security and having a chilling effect on any future whistleblower who sees wrongdoing.\n\nWe must be sure that the President and his Administration are always conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President\u2019s personal or political interest.\n\nI am calling on Republicans to join us in insisting that the Acting DNI obey the law as we seek the truth to protect the American people and our Constitution.\n\nThis violation is about our national security. The Inspector General determined that the matter is \u201curgent\u201d and therefore we face an emergency that must be addressed immediately.\n\nIf the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\n\nThank you for your patriotism.\n\nbest regards,\n\nNancy", "description": "Wow..09/22/2019 19:10:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/196/ffb018ef-76b9-4f2c-b325-04ac8852976d.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
