It wants your forgiveness and attention. It wants undying love, while you\u2019re at it. The mark is to grammar what a Red Sox fan is to baseball, insisting it\u2019s the underdog yet coming out on top, spilling its beer on your lap in exaltation.\n\nTo Jonny Sun , a writer on \u201c BoJack Horseman \u201d and a viral tweeter, the exclamation point is the wild child. \u201cIt\u2019s a rebellion against the weighty rules of grammar that were passed down to us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe exclamation point is a way of saying we\u2019re bucking these rules because they feel old fashioned and dusty.\u201d The period, in contrast, \u201cfeels like a sigh.\u201d\n\nAuthors and editors typically denigrate the insurgent mark as undignified. Veneeta Dayal , a professor of linguistics at Yale, said formal communication has historically separated the informational from the emotional \u2014 and the exclamation point lines up with the latter. The author Elmore Leonard advised writers to measure out \u201ctwo or three per 100,000 words of prose.\u201d F. Scott Fitzgerald said exclamation points amount to \u201claughing at your own jokes.\u201d The mark was most at home on the children\u2019s shelf, in titles like \u201cOh, the Places You\u2019ll Go!\u201d and \u201cGood Grief, Charlie Brown!\u201d\n\nEager to please and good with kids, the exclamation point skews feminine. The writer Amelia Tait calls it \u201cemotional labor\u201d in grammatical form, shouldering the responsibility to ease tension or hurt. Gretchen McCulloch, a creator of the podcast \u201cLingthusiasm,\u201d said it functions as a \u201csocial smile\u201d and a mark of sincerity in a time when irony abounds. It just wants to Marie Kondo your sentences \u2014 to clear out a small space and spark some joy. (Its origin is the Latin symbol for joy , io.)\n\nTo some grammarians, attempts to condemn the mark smack of a dog whistle for sexism. \u201cUse too many exclamation points and you won\u2019t be taken seriously, use too few and you can come off as cold,\u201d said Deborah Tannen , a Georgetown linguistics professor who helped coin the phrase \u201cdouble bind.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the story of women\u2019s lives in a nutshell.\u201d", "description": "Some people who have been told to avoid them are wondering.
