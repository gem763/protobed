Nesbit,' by Eleanor Fitzsimons book review", "language": "en", "text": "Edith Nesbit got married at 18 when she was seven months pregnant. Her dandyish new husband, Hubert Bland, was so charming that Nesbit accepted his perennial waywardness \u2014 he seldom kept more than two mistresses at once \u2014 and even reared children from his liaisons as her own. Strikingly beautiful, Nesbit regularly engaged in light and serious flirtations herself. When playwright George Bernard Shaw ultimately declined to go to bed with her, she coldly informed him, \u201cYou had no right to write the preface if you were not going to write the book.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFamous for her bohemian caftans, an amber cigarette holder and the myriad bracelets she wore on her arms, Nesbit always worked on deadline at top speed. She could crank out 5,000 words in half a day \u2014 one draft, no revisions. Throughout the 1890s, she and Hubert (both leading members of the socialist Fabian Society) seemed tireless: writing tracts, throwing gigantic Christmas parties for hundreds of indigent children at their London home, hosting weekends of political discussion punctuated by badminton, charades and bibulous dinners. One regular guest, the married H.G. Wells, tried to run off with teenage Rosamund Bland \u2014 who wrongly believed that Nesbit was her mother \u2014 and the fleeing couple were only apprehended at Paddington station.\n\nSurprisingly, Nesbit opposed the women\u2019s suffragist movement, arguing that it took away energies better spent on furthering the socialist cause. Still, when a doctor in \u201cThe Railway Children\u201d explains that girls are \u201cpoor, soft, weak, frightened things like rabbits,\u201d Nesbit quickly dispels this nonsense with one of the most thrilling scenes in children\u2019s literature. To prevent a deadly crash, Bobbie must somehow stop the 11:29 express train as it comes barreling toward disaster. With no time to lose, she rushes onto the railroad tracks and stands there, frantically waving her torn-up red petticoat. She keeps shaking her makeshift flags, even after the speeding locomotive finally comes to a halt just yards in front of her.\n\nEven more than previous biographies, \u201cThe Life and Loves of E. Nesbit\u201d quotes liberally from Nesbit\u2019s poetry and her half-forgotten novels for adults. In particular, Fitzsimons emphasizes how often elements from real life \u2014 people, names, events, Fabian politics \u2014 are reflected or repurposed in the fiction. She also provides enjoyable pen portraits of the many extraordinary figures in Nesbit\u2019s circle, including the fiery theosophist Annie Besant and the notorious Frederick Rolfe, a.k.a. Baron Corvo (who left fleas wherever he sat). What Fitzsimons doesn\u2019t do, however, is discuss the books for children in detail.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn them, Nesbit\u2019s tone is light, humorous, gently ironic. When her bookish children play \u201cpretend\u201d or face real adversity, they almost always model their speech and behavior after their favorite reading. For example, during a game of hidden treasure, pagan princess Alice gives orders in an appropriately archaic high style: \u201cDig here, and that with courage and dispatch . . . Dig as you value your lives, for ere sundown the dragon who guards this spoil will return in his fiery fury and make you his unresisting prey.\u201d\n\nAt times, Nesbit can be almost Borgesian or Escher-like in her narrative intricacies. In \u201cThe Town in the Library in the Town in the Library,\u201d the plot turns on infinite regression. Children build a model city in their house\u2019s library, get miniaturized and discover that the city they have built includes their own house, inside of which is a library with a model city . . . and so on, forever.\n\nIn \u201cThe Enchanted Castle\u201d Nesbit produced a multi-stranded novel that plays with age-old questions about appearance and reality, the soul\u2019s relation to the body, the need for the numinous in ordinary life. Throughout it mixes Wodehousean comedy with the uncanny and, at one point, the truly nightmarish. Some Edwardian children decide to put on a play and, wanting an audience, create one out of coats, hats, gloves and old shoes held together by string and given vaguely human shape by coat racks and hangers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnfortunately, spunky Mabel casually says, \u201cI wish these creatures we made were alive. We should get something like applause then.\u201d At which point, the cobbled-together scarecrows and mannequins begin to clap.\n\nMatters soon grow metaphysically disorienting. The Ugly-Wuglies don\u2019t realize they are just agglomerations of household items. The intrepid Gerald follows one of these creatures to London, where it is recognized as a successful businessman: Mr. U.W. Ugli, Stock and Share Broker. Yet how is this possible? If this just-created Frankensteinian clotheshorse were again reduced to a coat and hat, would all memory of its \u201chuman\u201d existence disappear? \u201cWould the mahogany-and-clerk-furnished offices fade away?\u201d A philosophical abyss soon opens before the boy: \u201cWere the clerks real? Was the mahogany? Was he himself real?\u201d\n\nEnough for now. If you\u2019ve never read E. Nesbit\u2019s wonderful fiction, start with any of the titles I\u2019ve mentioned. If you already know her work, learn more about its astonishing author from Eleanor Fitzsimons\u2019s informative and entertaining biography.\n\nMichael Dirda reviews books each Thursday in Style.\n\nTHE LIFE AND LOVES OF E.
