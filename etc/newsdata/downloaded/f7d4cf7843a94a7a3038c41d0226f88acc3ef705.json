The excitement coincided with a 26% rally in Bitcoin, and also boosted stocks with more tenuous connections to blockchain, like baby-food producer Beingmate Co. and selfie-app developer Meitu Inc.\n\nXi said China will increase investment in blockchain technology after chairing a study session last week on developing the industry, state-owned Xinhua reported late Friday. The market reaction shows how far an endorsement from Xi can go in China, where high-level officials on Monday began their first major policy meeting since early 2018.\n\n\u201cMost of these companies, especially those that are just beginning to state their connection with blockchain today, are trying to take advantage of the hype,\u201d said Li Shiyu, fund manager at Guangdong Xiaoyu Investment Management Co. \u201cIt shows how much excitement can be triggered by something stressed as a priority by the top man himself.\u201d\n\nThe Shenzhen Information Technology Index closed 5.3% higher on Monday, its biggest advance in eight months. Hundsun Technologies Inc., Easysight Supply Chain Management Co., YGSOFT Inc. and dozens more companies with officially registered blockchain businesses rose by the 10% limit.\n\nIn Hong Kong, traders singled out Meitu due to its plans for an encrypted user-identification system. The shares surged as much as 30%. Pantronics Holdings Ltd. -- which earlier this month said it will change its name to \u201cHuobi Technology\u201d, a reference to a digital currency exchange -- rallied as much as 67%. American depositary receipts of Chinese blockchain companies also surged Friday.\n\nInvestors pressured other firms to jump on the blockchain hype, using an online Q&A platform to submit thousands of questions on their plans to use the technology.\n\n\u201cPlease proactively make expansion plans in blockchain to jump on state policies -- doing so would be the best reward to investors,\u201d urged one shareholder of development-store operator Hunan Friendship & Apollo Commercial Co.\n\n--With assistance from Ryan Lovdahl.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: April Ma in Beijing at ama112@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Sofia Horta e Costa at shortaecosta@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese investors snapped up every blockchain-related stock in sight after President Xi Jinping said Beijing wants to speed up development of the technology.The gains were widespread Monday, with Insigma Technology Co. and Sinodata Co. among more than 60 tech shares surging by the daily", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HIoqFlB7miKjl_ItVnO_yQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/1fb8fc8d33700aaf2898cb9b5def51de", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
