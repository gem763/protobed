We\u2019ve become too loud for people to handle so they try to silence us,\u201d she told reporters before the rally. \u201cWe should also take that as a compliment.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the climate strikes she inspired started in Asia and continued in Europe after similar strikes a week earlier.

She met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau privately for about 15 minutes in his capacity as a leader of the government not the Liberal Party.\n\nLater she was asked what her message to Trudeau had been.\n\n\u201cHe is of course obviously not doing enough but... this is such a huge problem,\u201d she said. \u201cMy message to all the politicians is the same, to just listen to the science, act on the science.\u201d\n\nTrudeau is promising more climate action but has also had to defend his decision to buy and expand a major oil pipeline in western Canada.\n\n\u201cYou are the problem!
