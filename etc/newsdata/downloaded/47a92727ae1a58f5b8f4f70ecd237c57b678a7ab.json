Taking a cue from Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight trilogy, Todd Phillips has given the Batman canon another gritty, more realistic origin story to explain its greatest antagonist in Joker \u2014 disturbing, affecting, but perhaps more ultimately nihilistic film than either Phillips or star Joaquin Phoenix intended.\n\nSet in 1981, a marker only indirectly gleaned, Joker tells the story of mentally ill, quasi-professional clown Arthur Fleck, who barely exists in his poverty-stricken life. It\u2019s difficult to tell at times if his constant degradation and victimization has caused his wretched mental state or if it\u2019s the other way around, but after a while you realize that it doesn\u2019t really matter. Gotham City has descended into social collapse that parallels the 1970s-80s version of New York City, and budget cuts are making it worse, especially for Arthur. He\u2019s forced to go off his meds while trying at the same time to pursue his dream of stand-up comedy, at which point it starts becoming more difficult for Arthur \u2014 and the audience \u2014 to tell what is real and what is delusion inside Arthur\u2019s head.\n\nMuch has been made of the politics of this film and its supposed celebration of violence, and of Arthur\u2019s stand-in for an \u201cincel movement,\u201d which is a contradiction in terms. The politics of this film are much more difficult to pin down than that, however, and are really only scenery to Arthur\u2019s meltdown, at least until the final act. Thomas Wayne is not a terribly sympathetic character, a change from the DC canon in which Batman\u2019s father is usually described in near-martyr terms, and the city\u2019s uprising as well as Arthur\u2019s own sympathies seem vaguely more in line with Antifa and Occupy Wall Street than Proud Boys and MAGAists. Even in the final act, the motivation matters much less than the reality of the chaos and utter collapse of Gotham in Joker\u2019s rise.\n\nJust as the role landed the late Heath Ledger an Oscar, Joaquin Phoenix seems destined to be at the top of the awards short lists next year. He gives a superb performance in the film, having lost more than 50 pounds to play Arthur and giving the role an almost spectral and haunted look. His physicality dominates the film, and in fact seems to be almost the entirety of the film.\n\nThe rest of the cast almost fades into the background. Robert De Niro seems both wasted and miscast as talk-show host and comedian Murray Franklin, a cheesy Johnny Carson knock-off. Frances Conroy does better as Arthur\u2019s mother Penny, but perhaps purposefully gives little hint about her reveals in flashbacks to come. Zazie Beetz, who did so well in Deadpool 2 as Domino, is given nearly nothing to do as Arthur\u2019s neighbor and potential love interest. Brett Cullen\u2019s Thomas Wayne lacks any real style at all, with nothing but his money and his (perhaps) arrogance to even mark his presence in the film. Everything sinks into the grimy and washed-out background of Gotham, including Arthur, at least until his alter ego finally emerges.\n\nJoker is no doubt an interesting and at times gripping film. But does this all work? By the time we get to the final act, viewers might wonder what the point of the film is. The climax is telegraphed, even if the choreography of getting there is undoubtedly compelling, which robs it of its shock value. The stretched-out fall of Arthur leaves less room to contemplate the rise of Joker, which makes the first part of the film an at-times frustratingly slow character study, leaving audiences stuck in the head of someone to whom they really can\u2019t relate at all.\n\nThe arrival of the last act, which is spectacular in its way, accentuates the essential meaninglessness of what preceded it. Joker shows us one version of how the Joker came to be, perhaps, but as an accident of fate rather than as a master plan of villainy. Ledger\u2019s Joker was a malign philosopher, a man with a distinct plan to prosecute the world for its imperfections. Phoenix\u2019s Joker almost literally falls into the role of master criminal, with few clues or skills to maintain it. There is no sense of paths-not-taken or deliberate choices and plans; Arthur and the audience are strapped to a roller-coaster car of fate, with one track and one destination \u2014 which we already know before the ride begins.\n\nIn the end, we realize that maybe we were better off not knowing the why of Joker. The Joker backstory mattered most in Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight because it was left untold and unknowable. The Joker just was, existing in his own moment and in no other, made all the more frightening for it. In both Tim Burton\u2019s Batman and especially this film, the backstory subtracts the \u201csuper\u201d from Joker\u2019s super-villainy, perhaps even more so in this case. What matters is Joker\u2019s threat, not Arthur\u2019s descent, and that makes most of Joker a very long, if incredibly well crafted, irrelevancy.\n\nStill, for what it is \u2014 and perhaps especially for its throwback sensibilities of 1970s cinema \u2014 Joker is still a good film. It\u2019s a rare merger of comic-book genre with realistic human drama, without superpowers, aliens, fantasy tech, and Justice Leagues getting in the way. On the Hot Air scale, I give Joker a four:\n\n5 \u2013 Full price ticket\n\n4 \u2013 Matinee only\n\n3 \u2013 Wait for Blu-Ray/DVD/PPV rental or purchase\n\n2 \u2013 Watch it when it hits Netflix/cable\n\n1 \u2013 Avoid at all costs\n\nJoker is rated R for realistic violence and language. It\u2019s way too intense for younger viewers, and I\u2019d be uncomfortable taking teens younger than 17 at all. It\u2019s not for those who recoil at bloody violence.\n\nIf you do go, however, watch for a couple of things in the final act. First, pay attention to the movie marquee, which captures Phillips\u2019 approach to this film in a unique manner. Also, see if you find the same reference to Turk 182! that I think I saw.
