Hunt Third-Quarter Profit Falls Short of Expectations", "language": "en", "text": "J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. reported roughly flat load volumes in its truck-rail intermodal business in the latest period, which still drove a better-than-expected 7% increase in overall revenue.\n\nProfit for the September quarter missed Wall Street expectations, and company officials said they expected continued pressure on the money-losing integrated capacity solutions segment.\n\nShares of the company, a freight industry bellwether, fell almost 1.9% to $109.49 in after-hours trading after closing Tuesday up 1.8% at $111.60.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe intermodal segment accounts for more than half of Lowell, Ark.-based J.B. Hunt\u2019s revenue and operating profit. The unit has struggled with lower volumes, although the company has managed to squeeze more money from each load.\n\nOn Tuesday, company officials reported the segment\u2019s revenue rose 1.8% to $1.24 billion in the September quarter, slightly below analysts\u2019 projections, reflecting roughly flat volume compared with the same period a year earlier and about a 2% increase in revenue per load.\n\nThe operator said it faced higher costs in buying freight rail service and higher costs to recruit and retain drivers.\n\nChief Financial Officer David Mee said during a conference call with analysts that freight volumes remain below 2018 levels.\n\nThird-quarter profit rose to $151.2 million, or $1.40 a share, up from $131.1 million, or $1.19 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Operating revenue, including fuel surcharge revenue, rose to $2.36 billion.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet expected about $1.44 a share in profit and $2.34 billion in revenue.\n\nJ.B. Hunt didn\u2019t update the status of a freight revenue dispute with BNSF Railway, its partner in the intermodal business. The matter is in arbitration, and J.B. Hunt has taken more than $100 million in contingency charges.\n\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com", "description": "J.B.
