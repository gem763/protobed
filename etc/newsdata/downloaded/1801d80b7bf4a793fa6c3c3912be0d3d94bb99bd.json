According to its agent, Bernadette George, asombrosa means \"amazing\" in Spanish, and the villa has bold and colorful modern elements. Inspired by the characteristic geometric shapes and block colors of Mexican architect Ricardo Legoretta, the symmetric design of Casa Asombrosa features parallel pillars and straight lines.\n\nDavid Brockelbank, the villa\u2019s project manager, considers the home\u2019s most attractive element to be an indoor-outdoor stairway that connects the courtyard with the second level at the front of the house.\n\nThe seamless transition between the interior and exterior of the home is enhanced by materials such as terracotta floor tiles found in both indoor and outdoor spaces, as well as its sliding doors and expansive windows.\n\nMore: Do I Still Have to Pay the U.K. Stamp Duty Tax if I Buy Property in Turks & Caicos or the Cayman Islands?\n\nStats\n\nCasa Asombrosa is comprised of two structures, a 3,578-square-foot, two-story main house, and a 1,160-square-foot guest house. The main house has three bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms, while the guesthouse has one bedroom and one bathroom.\n\nThe main house boasts an additional 1,860 square feet of patio space, and the property sits on 1.4 acres of land.\n\nAmenities\n\nAn elegant rectangular lap pool is designed to be perfectly sunny all day, while a spacious pool terrace provides plenty of room for lounging and entertaining. Off the kitchen is an open-air dining pavilion, topped by a wooden pergola, all benefitting from expansive ocean views.\n\nThe one-bedroom guest house echoes the modern design of the property, with matching columns, brilliant hues, and oversized bi-fold glass doors.. A wraparound glass wall allows for a breathtaking view of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThere\u2019s also a private entrance and parking area.\n\nFrom Penta: Objects of British and European Royal Provenance to Be Auctioned at Christie\u2019s\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nCrook\u2019s Bay Estate is located on a hillside above Crook\u2019s Bay on the southeastern coast of Virgin Gorda island, just a five-minutes drive from the Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbour, the main ferry dock, and the commercial center of Spanish Town.\n\nThe most private estate on the island and one of the most exclusive, according to Ms. George, Crook\u2019s Bay Estate is a low-density area with only 12 other residential parcels of land, only about eight of which have been built upon at present. The 13th parcel is a natural greenbelt located along the waterfront, which will be kept as a protected green space for residents to enjoy.\n\nThe beautiful Atlantic beaches of Virgin Gorda are the island\u2019s playgrounds, where residents can enjoy leisure activities of all kinds, from diving and fishing to yachting. The British Virgin Islands are known as the sailing capital of the Caribbean, if not the world, according to Mr. Brockelbank, who explains that the archipelago of islands is very protected with calm seas for the most part, and very consistent trade winds.\n\nAgent: Bernadette George, Smiths Gore, an affiliate of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\n\nView the original listing.
