In July, he griped on Twitter about a paper straw \u2014 marketed as an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic \u2014 getting soggy and useless in his sweet tea. And because environmentally friendly is often associated with liberal in the context of the culture wars, a $15 pack of Trump-branded plastic straws soon arrived on the campaign store.\n\nThe campaign sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of the red straws, it told RealClearPolitics.\n\nThe marker, on the other hand, is black and emblazoned with Trump\u2019s signature in gold, and sellslling in a pack of five for $15. For comparison, a pack of five Sharpie markers sells for $3.99 at office supply store Staples.", "description": "The product rollout came as a tongue-in-cheek reference to this week's hurricane controversy", "authors": ["Arren Kimbel-Sannit"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d7/34/38bf95584e42b677d6ad6a7fe0a2/190906-dj-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
