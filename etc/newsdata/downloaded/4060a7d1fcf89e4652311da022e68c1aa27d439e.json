(angela n./Flickr)\n\nRain was a bit more extensive than expected this morning, but it didn\u2019t amount to a whole lot in most spots. Of course, when it hasn\u2019t rained at all in 16 days, any rain feels like a lot. The clouds and damp conditions also helped keep us in the 70s, which is closer to where we should be this time of year than we have been in recent times. I certainly wasn\u2019t complaining.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: There could still be a random shower or two, mainly south and east. Clouds should try to break a bit through the evening, but some may remain stubborn into the night. As winds trend light, fog could form in a few spots thanks to some trapped low-level moisture. Lows settle across the 60s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday): Some thicker clouds could linger into the morning, but we should end up partly to mostly sunny with time. Highs will be mainly in the low and mid-80s, and humidity will be moderate but will rise (dew points heading up through the 60s). Winds will be from the south, around 10 mph.\n\nSee Jason Samenow\u2019s forecast through the weekend. And if you haven\u2019t already, join us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

We broke the streak of 16 days without any rain in the city. In the process, the 0.14 inches recorded at National Airport pushed us out of the tie for the driest September on record. With 0.25 inches on the month, it looks as if we\u2019re poised to finish fifth-driest, which is still quite something. Dulles picked up even less rain, only 0.07 inches, and BWI only received a trace. A few spots probably had upward of a quarter of an inch or so.\n\nThe trees were happy with whatever fell.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
