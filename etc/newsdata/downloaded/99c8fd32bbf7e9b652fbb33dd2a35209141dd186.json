He was awarded an Asahi Beer gift set worth 100,000 yen.\n\n\"Everything I made was from the 100 yen shop,\" Okinaka said, as he lifted up parts of his costume, including a finger sushi and eyeballs.\n\nHe explained that he had been waiting to redeem himself ever since failing to claim his $1,000 first prize at a different Halloween party years ago because he left too early.\n\n\"Today my dream came true,\" he said.\n\nA serving of any of the 30 different dishes and drinks could be exchanged for a ticket costing 250 yen each, of which pair sets were sold at the door. Popular stalls included Halloween cookies in a tin can and pumpkin chicken curry fried rice.\n\nAttendees then voted for their favorite dish by writing its number on a leaflet and dropping it in a box. The event was restricted to those aged 20 or older due to alcohol being served on site.\n\nShibuya Ward announced it would ban street drinking in areas near JR Shibuya Station during Halloween and the previous weekend.\n\nThe ordinance took effect from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. on Friday and Saturday and will be enforced again on Sunday from 6 p.m. to midnight, as well as on Halloween night.\n\nAlthough no penalties are stipulated for offenders in the ordinance, ward officials will patrol the area in groups of three to reprimand those violating the ban.\n\nForty-one stores in the area, including convenience stores and MEGA Don Quijote, were also asked to refrain from selling alcohol on Saturday night and Halloween.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Shibuya was brimming with superheroes and otherworldly creatures on Saturday night as costumed revelers congregated in one of Tokyo's major entertainment districts on the weekend before Halloween.
