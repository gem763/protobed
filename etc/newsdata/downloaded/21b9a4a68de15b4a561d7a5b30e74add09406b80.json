The son of a Surinamese-American father and Dutch mother, Dest has become a regular this season at Dutch power Ajax, which reached last year\u2019s Champions League final.\n\nHe said he is being recruited by the Royal Dutch Football Association. If he played in the new Nations League, which is an official competition, he would be tied to the U.S.\n\nBrenden Aaronson, an 18-year-old midfielder with Philadelphia, is the only newcomer among 26 players on the roster announced Wednesday by U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter.\n\nDefenders DeAndre Yedlin and Matt Miazga are on the roster after returning from injury layoffs.\n\nRecovered from groin surgery, Yedlin entered in the 74th minute of Newcastle\u2019s 5-0 loss at Leicester on Sunday, his first appearance in a game since April 6.\n\nMiazga hurt a hamstring while playing for Reading on Aug. 24 and returned to start in the League Cup against Wolverhampton on Sept. 25, although he did not play in the Royals\u2019 last two league matches.\n\nChristian Pulisic, the Americans\u2019 21-year-old star midfielder, was included despite his benching by Chelsea. Released early from U.S. camp after the Mexico match, he has appeared just once for Chelsea since then, in the League Cup against Grimsby on Sept. 25.\n\nToronto midfielder Michael Bradley and forward Jozy Altidore return after missing last month\u2019s matches to remain with their club.\n\nThe U.S. plays Cuba on Oct. 11 at Washington, D.C., then meets Canada four days later in Toronto, then hosts Canada on Nov. 15 at Orlando, Florida, and plays Cuba four days after at George Town, Cayman Islands.
