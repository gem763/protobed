China has been courting partnerships with several of India\u2019s neighbors \u2014 from Maldives to Bangladesh. And India has taken offense at one specific project in particular: The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n\nThe CPEC is a $60 billion infrastructure program that China launched as part of the BRI that\u2019s supposed to link China\u2019s Xinjiang region to Pakitan\u2019s Gwadar port.\n\nMap locating the route of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Countries outside of South Asia are also concerned about China\u2019s BRI and have launched various programs to address their concerns, which revolve around whether China is engaging in debt-trap diplomacy or creating opportunities for corruption.\n\nIn the U.S., Congress recently passed a bill that created a new U.S. development agency \u2014 the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation \u2014 that aims to offer what D.C.-based think tank CSIS calls a \u201cprivate sector, market-based solution\u201d to state-to-state lending issues that arise with China\u2019s BRI.\n\nThe European Union and Japan have also signed a deal to build infrastructure projects around the world, covering sectors from transport to digital industries, aimed at countering the BRI.\n\nIn the meantime, the Chinese economy is slowing down \u2014 which has caused BRI spending to slow down. China\u2019s GDP growth dropping last quarter to the lowest in nearly three decades.\n\n\u2014\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.
