(Rob Kruyt/Canadian Press)\n\nHeiner-Moller is using the China tournament to prepare for the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament in January/February 2020. The Canadian women are coming off a 4-0 loss to No. 10 Japan in Shizuoka on Oct. 6.\n\n\"If you want to take something positive out of a 4-0 defeat, it's the impact it does have on people,\" Heiner-Moller told a media conference call Wednesday. \"I can tell you we had a meeting just after the loss against Japan where we had a very hard conversation from me to them and in between players as well \u2014 like what it is to pull that (Canada) jersey over your head.\"\n\nThe Dane said his squad was still suffering from the hangover of its early World Cup exit during the summer in France, where Canada was beaten 1-0 by Sweden in the round of 16.\n\nHe wanted more commitment to the cause.\n\n\"Canada is about a team \u2014 a team of very good individuals but the team's more important than anything.\"\n\n6 players aged 21 or younger\n\nThe talk seemed to work. Canada played Japan to a 0-0 draw in a closed-door match the day after the 4-0 loss. The trips to Asia are also a chance to test the local waters ahead of the Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nSmith is one of six players on the aged 21 or younger. The others are Huitema and Jayde Riviere (18), Julia Grosso (19), Deanne Rose (20) and Gabrielle Carle (21).\n\nSmith started playing soccer at five in Whitby, Ont. She was 12 when she made her debut in the Canadian youth program in 2017 and represented Canada at the 2018 CONCACAF Girls' Under-15 Championship. She has also attended four under-17 camps.\n\nExcellent on the ball with good pace, she can beat defenders and feed teammates. Smith can also win the ball back.\n\nIn watching Smith, Heiner-Moller was drawn by how she kept on getting up and going after opponents after they had chopped her down.\n\nSmith made another impression in May when she was one of several local players summoned to fill out the numbers at a camp in Toronto before a pre-World Cup friendly with Mexico.\n\n\"If she comes in and she looks as good as I hope she will then she could definitely see some game action,\" Heiner-Moller said.\n\nHopes Sinclair continues to play\n\nVeterans on the team include Christine Sinclair (287 caps) and Sophie Schmidt (189 caps). With 182 international goals, Sinclair is two away from tying retired American striker Abby Wambach's world record of 184.\n\nHeiner-Moller says he hopes Tokyo will not mark Sinclair's last Olympics, saying she continues to play at the highest level.\n\n\"Her movement, her attacking movements are just second to none,\" he said.\n\n\"She impacts this group of people in a lot of ways ... I cannot speak highly enough of her as both an athlete, as a footballer, and also as a person,\" he added.", "description": "Canada coach Kenneth Heiner-Moller first noticed Olivia Smith last year when he travelled with the Canadian youth teams.
