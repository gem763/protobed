Our students deserve no less,\" he said.\n\n\"Our government will continue to negotiate in good faith in order to reach a deal that makes sure students remain in class. We look forward to continuing our work with all our partners.\"", "description": "A major union representing education workers in Ontario says 93 per cent its members have voted overwhelmingly in favour of a potential strike that could take effect by the end of the month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4308146.1568228053!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ridgemont-high-school-basement-class.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
