I\u2019m about to put my dukes up and the F-word hangs on my lips \u2014 and then I remember: \u201cAh, right: They\u2019re Israelis. They\u2019re supposed to be this way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the same women who are trying to run you over to get to the overhead bins they want would probably cook you a meal and tuck you in at night.\n\nAnd take up arms to defend you.\n\nCulture, culture \u2026\n\n\u2022 Inside the airport, there is a sign \u2014 a tourism poster: Follow Your Sunshine, Visit Florida. Huh. Yet there\u2019s plenty of sunshine here, isn\u2019t there? Regardless, I should not overthink a tourism poster \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 The immigration official looks at my passport very, very skeptically. There is a sour look on his face. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d he asks. I say that I\u2019m a journalist. If possible, his expression gets more sour. \u201cDo you have a journalist\u2019s ID card?\u201d he asks. No. I\u2019m not from a Communist country.\n\n\u201cWhere do you work?\u201d he asks. \u201cNational Review magazine in New York,\u201d I answer. \u201cWhat kind of magazine is that?\u201d he asks. I say that it\u2019s a magazine of politics and culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith an air of both annoyance and boredom, he turns to his smartphone and fiddles with it for a while. Suddenly, his face is wreathed in smiles. He grins at me almost goofily, like a girl. I have never seen such a sudden change of countenance. He immediately hands me back my passport and sends me on my way.\n\nDid he Google me? Had he received a billet doux from his girlfriend? I don\u2019t know \u2026\n\n\u2022 Israeli cabbies are legendary \u2014 legendary for trying to rip you off. There is a reason for the legend; it is grounded in fact \u2014 and really too bad. Because a cabbie is often a person\u2019s introduction to Israel. What a first impression, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a matter of national honor \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 All the clich\u00e9s about Tel Aviv are true: young, vibrant, hip, sensual. I am reminded of Miami. The beachtown sensuousness of Miami and the hipster vibe of Brooklyn (certain neighborhoods of).\n\nIt is humid as hell, by the way. The temperature is not high \u2014 only about 80 \u2014 but the humidity is very high.\n\nIs it worth mentioning that the girls and women are beautiful, and often exotically so? That\u2019s a little like mentioning that the bread in France is good, I know. But it\u2019s still true.\n\nOf course, the climate and the general beachtownness helps. Sundresses and all that.\n\nA middle-aged Israeli man tells me, \u201cThe nation got seriously prettier once the Russians started coming.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. is a nation of immigrants, so is Israel. It is a Jewish state, yes \u2014 but a nation of immigrants at the same time. There are so many skin tones, so many hair types. Years ago, I had a visit here, and a colleague \u2014 a young Jewish American \u2014 said, \u201cMy Jewdar is all screwed up here.\u201d\n\nIt ain\u2019t Scarsdale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 I am happy to see young mothers (and fathers, I guess) \u2014 young people with children. Sign of hope, some people think. Sign of a willingness to press onward.\n\nOnce, I asked Charles Krauthammer whether he thought Israel would survive. He said, \u201cIt depends on two things: the willingness of Israelis themselves to survive and the support of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Given the general looseness of Tel Aviv, I\u2019m surprised to see pedestrians waiting for the light to change at intersections \u2014 even when there are no cars coming. Where are we, Salzburg? My Ann Arbor feet want to get moving \u2026\n\n\u2022 At a restaurant, a waitress approaches a table and talks to the couple seated at it. She says, \u201cAre you from South Africa?\u201d Yes, they are. \u201cI\u2019m from South Africa,\u201d she says. Then they talk about places, etc., they know in common.\n\nThis is very Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Needless to say, one should go to various restaurants and order various dishes. Personally, I can\u2019t stop returning to one restaurant, for one dish: spicy ground lamb on Yemeni bread (with a fresh salad, of course).\n\n\u2022 Here is a Vietnamese joint \u2014 and I got a kick out of the sign, somehow:\n\n\u2022 A jaunt to Jerusalem with friends, to see the Sharanskys \u2014 Natan and Avital. To read a little about it, go here. I did an article.\n\n(After this article appeared, more than one person said, \u201cHe [Sharansky] is the greatest Jew alive.\u201d And one of the greatest people, no question.)\n\n\u2022 Bad news, and common news: There has been a stabbing this morning. More than one stabbing, by one terrorist, a young Palestinian. He carried out his attacks at the Damascus Gate, which is a main entrance to the Old City (Jerusalem).\n\nLet me quote from a news report, published later on:\n\nAn Israeli man who sustained life-threatening stab wounds \u2026 was released from a Jerusalem hospital on Wednesday, vowing to reporters, \u201cWe will not be afraid.\u201d Gavriel Lavi, 47, said he struggled to remember the details of the stabbing attack \u2026 but believed he had been saved from death by prayers and charity given by fellow students at his yeshiva, or Jewish religious seminary.\n\n\u2022 I attend a wedding, outside Tel Aviv. It\u2019s a lovely evening, but not un-humid. Many of the men are in jackets and ties; many of them are not. One in the latter category tells me, \u201cYou can tell who was born here and who wasn\u2019t. We sabras don\u2019t wear jackets and ties to weddings.\u201d\n\nHappily, I shed my jacket, though keep the tie in place.\n\n\u2022 Have I mentioned that the wedding is outdoors? Let me offer a quick shot of the scene:\n\n\u2022 The father of the bride gives a warm, elegant toast. He is from Iraq. (What a story the Iraqi Jews have.) In his toast, he quotes a Turkish saying, and a Persian one. He is a worldly man, a worldly Middle Easterner \u2014 cosmopolitan, you might say. This is a bad word in some quarters, but not to me, it isn\u2019t. The father of the bride is an Israeli patriot. He has also had a broad, rich experience of life.\n\nSo, sue \u2019im \u2026\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s not like me to shoot food porn, but get a load of this spaghetti:\n\nWhere\u2019s the beef? (Remember that slogan? It made its way into the 1984 presidential campaign.)\n\nPut it on simmer, baby:\n\nI could go on \u2026\n\n\u2022 At my table, there is a man named Moishe. \u201cOh, like \u2018Moses,\u2019\u201d I say. \u201cNo,\u201d he replies. \u201c\u2018Moses\u2019 is like \u2018Moishe.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is one of the greatest replies I have ever heard \u2026\n\n\u2022 In Tel Aviv, Ben-Gurion Boulevard is a major thoroughfare. Well, it should be. So is Begin Road. Ditto. (\u201cBegin\u201d as in \u201cMenachem,\u201d by the way, not as in \u201ccommence.\u201d) I also see Levi Eshkol Street. Do you know about him? The third prime minister of Israel, serving from 1963 until his death in 1969.\n\n(By the way, if you have any interest in Israeli politics at all, you will love \u2014 devour \u2014 Yehuda Avner\u2019s memoirs, The Prime Ministers. The book is like candy.)\n\nThere is also Rabin Square \u2014 where Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was murdered in 1995. The square used to be called \u201cKings of Israel Square.\u201d (Some people still call it that.)\n\n\u2022 Ah, the beach, the Med \u2014 which makes me think of another late prime minister, Shimon Peres. He met with a group of us journalists in 2005. The location was Davos. Let me fish out, and quote from, my journal:\n\nThe Labor head speaks first about the need for the economic betterment of the PA [Palestinian Authority]: Europeans, and others, should invest there. In Gaza, for example, unemployment is over 45 percent. Someone asks, \u201cWhat kinds of business would you like to see in the PA?\u201d He answers \u2014 I like this phrase \u2014 \u201cEverything that life calls for.\u201d He then elaborates: \u201chigh tech, low tech, no tech.\u201d He points out that Gaza, someday, should be ripe for tourism: It has \u201c43 kilometers of the most beautiful beaches in the Mediterranean.\u201d He wonders whether (abandoned) settlements can be converted to resorts.\n\nYeah, well \u2026\n\n\u2022 Tel Aviv\u2019s waterfront is very, very friendly to people who want to walk. You can walk alongside the beach forever (though the surfaces change, not unpleasantly).\n\nCare for a quick shot?\n\n\u2022 One of the sequence of beaches here is (officially) \u201cdog-friendly\u201d \u2014 meaning that Fido can frolic unleashed, as his owners look on, grinning.\n\n\u2022 Speaking of animals: I see five horses \u2014 beautiful thoroughbreds (I believe) \u2014 being walked by handlers on grassy areas (not knolls) just beyond a beach. Where are we, Kentucky?\n\n\u2022 On the beach, a mother in a bikini throws a football to her two young receiver sons. She has a good arm. A native Israeli, too (as her Hebrew indicates). I\u2019m impressed. I wonder if the boys appreciate that this is not entirely normal.\n\n\u2022 Want to get some reading done?\n\nAnd the other side:\n\n\u2022 You can hear cries of muezzins all over the world, including here in Tel Aviv. One rises from the Great Mahmoudiya Mosque, near the beach \u2026\n\n\u2022 Speaking of religion: I see some Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and their booth. I\u2019m reminded that these people are banned and persecuted in Putin\u2019s Russia, which burns me.\n\n\u2022 Amid the buildings in Tel Aviv, the Trade Tower gleams, which makes me think, contentedly, \u201cUp from the socialist past?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Have another beach scene:\n\nAnd spot the cat? On the rocks, at about 5 o\u2019clock?\n\n\u2022 I appreciate a blunt sign. Hard to get blunter than \u201cDanger of Death!\u201d\n\n\u2022 In my experience \u2014 limited, to be sure \u2014 Israelis are not great standers in line \u2026\n\n\u2022 You know where they learn to stand in line? The Zarkor School. It is my favorite school in Israel, and possibly in the world. It has just three grades, so far: pre-school, kindergarten, and first grade. I bet it will grow. Zarkor was founded by my friend Michael Friedman, and it is a pioneering effort. Learn about it here.\n\nMichael \u2014 who is a phenomenal story all by himself \u2014 is married to another phenom, Rachel Zabarkes Friedman, a scholar who has three degrees from Harvard, but the pinnacle of whose life, surely, was her internship at National Review \u2026\n\n(When I interviewed her, on the phone, I sat up a little straighter, because she was so authoritative, interesting, and compelling. She was just in college, mind you.)\n\n\u2022 You are familiar with the pop song \u201cSaturday in the Park\u201d: \u201cPeople dancing, people laughing, a man selling ice cream, singing Italian songs.\u201d Well, Saturday, it seems to me, is a deader, or emptier, or quieter day in Tel Aviv \u2014 yes, even in Tel Aviv, to say nothing of Jerusalem and elsewhere. (Tel Aviv is regarded as a secular city.) Friday is probably more like \u201cSaturday in the Park.\u201d\n\n\u2022 See the British embassy, here in Tel Aviv?\n\nIt reminds me that ours is now in Jerusalem. I wrote about this issue for years and years: from the point of view of U.S. foreign policy; from the point of view of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict; and from the point of view of U.S. politics. I should not repeat myself, as I\u2019m trying to breeze through a journal. Maybe I could provide a link.\n\nHmmm \u2014 here\u2019s a dollop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 I meet a woman who has a daughter in the third grade. She sings in a chorus (the daughter). One of the songs they sing is a patriotic one, saying that, surely, some of the little boys in their midst will grow up to die in Israeli wars.\n\nThis is not a country bereft of realism, you might say (putting it mildly).\n\n\u2022 It is also not a country bereft of stress. The difficulty of life in Israel is famous, or infamous. I meet a man who is hoping to emigrate to Canada. He is native-born (in Israel, I mean). After his military service, he went to Japan, where he worked for seven years. It is not uncommon for Israelis to do this kind of thing, he says. He loved Japan: its orderliness, its peacefulness. When he returned to Israel, he found the stress \u2014 the noise, the pressure, the tumult \u2014 almost unbearable.\n\nLook, this is just one testimony, one story, one guy. But no Israeli would be surprised to hear him.\n\n\u2022 I have not said anything about Prime Minister Netanyahu \u2014 and there is a lot of talk about him, among the people I meet. There was an election in April; there will be another in September. I\u2019m just breezin\u2019 along here, coming to a close. But let me say: Netanyahu is an interesting, impressive, and historic figure, with legions of admirers (including me). But even some of them say, or fear, that he has stayed too long.\n\nThis is an age-old problem. Leaders begin to equate their personal interests or desires with the national interest, you know? L\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est eux.\n\nAnyway, a big, big subject. (I used to call Netanyahu \u201cthe Leader of the West.\u201d I also applied the phrase to Stephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada.)\n\n\u2022 You want to see a funny sign? I don\u2019t have a picture, but I can quote it for you: Please Avoid Unpleasantness Involved in Towing Vehicles.\n\nAmen.\n\n\u2022 An Israeli tells me that shalom is used for goodbye in only one, special instance: when you are going away for a long, long time. Then it\u2019s an adieu (rather than au revoir); an addio (rather than arrivederci).\n\n\u2022 It still amazes me, after all these years, that people \u2014 modern people \u2014 call their dad \u201cAbba,\u201d just as in the Bible \u2026\n\n\u2022 One last shot of funkilicious Tel Aviv?\n\n\u2022 When I get back to New York, an airport official is jawing at a man who is hawking a car service, and he responds, \u201cI know my rights!\u201d\n\nAh, America. See you, dear ones, and thanks for going to Israel with me.\n\nOne more thing, maybe. Four years ago, I wrote an essay called \u201cHung Up on Israel\u201d: here. It answered the question, \u201cWhy do you care about Israel so much?\u201d At least, it answered it as well as I can.\n\nThanks again, and see you.", "description": "Sights, sounds, smells, and feelings in Israel\u2019s second-largest city.", "authors": ["Jay Nordlinger", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "David French", "Matthew Continetti", "Brian Stewart", "Jack Crowe", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kyle Smith", "Read More"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jerusalem-journal-main.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-06-20"}
