According to the RSPCA, a mother rabbit will close her bunnies into a burrow, returning to nurse around once a day. The baby bunnies, known as \u2018kittens\u2019, will start to emerge from the burrow at about 18 weeks, when they look like teeny adults. If the bunnies are found above ground, with their eyes closed, they will be too young to survive on their own and will need rescuing and taken to your local wildlife rehabilitator. If, like Sean, you find a rabbit abandoned in a cage, or in a bad condition, or you are worried about them, contact the RSPCA and your local vet ASAP.\n\nMORE: The purple shampoo challenge: Could it damage your hair?\n\nMORE: How to be an activist at Halloween\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A man has rescued a bunny after finding him alone and abandoned.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_94012776_1572459619.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
