Noticing Cavett\u2019s fidgeting, she wondered why she made everyone so uncomfortable. Because, a friend replied, no one knew if she was going to sing \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d or open her veins. \u201cSometimes I do both,\u201d Garland said, \u201cat the same time.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cJudy,\u201d Ren\u00e9e Zellweger plays a few variations on Garland near the end of her life: worried mother, needy lover, disaster, legend. The woman who remains out of sight, though, is the sadder, scarier Judy who threw a butcher knife at one of her children and threatened to jump out a window in front of another. Even so, Zellweger is solid in a movie that derives its force from its central mythic figure and your own Yellow Brick Road memories: the Hollywood supernova with the inner-child vaudevillian named Frances Ethel Gumm, a.k.a. Baby.\n\nOne of those biopics that tries to encapsulate the sweep and substance of a life by narrowing in on ostensibly representative moments, \u201cJudy\u201d concentrates on Garland\u2019s bumpy, weeks-long engagement at the Talk of the Town, a London cabaret-restaurant where patrons sometime s threw breadsticks at the faltering talent. When Garland arrived in London in late December 1968, she was broke. She had been forced to sell her house in Los Angeles \u2014 fans and servants had been helping pay the bills \u2014 and had effectively become a vagabond, which is how Gerald Clarke describes her in his sympathetic book \u201cGet Happy.\u201d", "description": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger plays Judy Garland near the end of her life, when she grasped onto one more comeback and one last chance.", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/arts/00judy1/00judy1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
