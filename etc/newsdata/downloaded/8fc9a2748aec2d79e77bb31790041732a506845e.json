I have no memory of any Dem in recent history with a national future daring to challenge \u201ckill \u2019em whenever\u201d orthodoxy. Gabbard is breaking new ground, which is also old ground:\n\nGabbard told Rubin she views abortion in a \u201clibertarian\u201d way, saying she doesn\u2019t think government should be dictating women\u2019s choices. \u201cI think that there should be some restrictions though,\u201d she added. Rubin asked if she had a \u201ccutoff point,\u201d to which she replied: \u201cI think the third trimester. Unless a woman\u2019s life or severe health consequences is at risk, then there shouldn\u2019t be an abortion in the third trimester.\u201d When Gabbard first became involved in politics in the Hawaii state legislature, she called herself pro-life, but later said having been deployed to Iraq changed her view of the issue. Since becoming a member of Congress, Gabbard has maintained a 100-percent rating from Planned Parenthood. She supports federal funding of abortion, but she did not co-sponsor a Democratic bill in the House that would repeal the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the direct use of taxpayer funds to cover abortion procedures. She also did not sponsor the Democratic \u201cWomen\u2019s Health Protection Act,\u201d a piece of federal legislation that would override state restrictions on abortion.\n\nBy no means is she pro-life, she\u2019s just a bit \u2014 a meaningful bit \u2014 less pro-choice than everyone else. Which is something.\n\nAnd so we turn again to one of the most confounding mysteries in politics this year: Why is Tulsi Gabbard running for president? What\u2019s her political endgame in taking a position like this, which is welcome to people like me who won\u2019t vote in a Democratic primary and not so welcome to people who will?\n\nThe Atlantic mulled Gabbard\u2019s strategy a few days ago and had no more luck than anyone else did in figuring out what she\u2019s up to.\n\nMany high-level Democrats I spoke with for this story, who insisted on anonymity to share their true feelings about her, suspect that Gabbard is up to something other than actually trying to win the party\u2019s nomination\u2014even if they can\u2019t quite identify what her goal is. These are people who have been wary since Gabbard became a Fox News favorite for criticizing Obama\u2019s foreign policy. They believed that their distrust was vindicated when Steve Bannon brought her in for a meeting with then-president-elect Donald Trump just two weeks after the 2016 election, which was one of Trump\u2019s first meetings with a Democrat. To this group, Gabbard looks like Jill Stein, who also talked about progressive politics and peace, but whose 2016 Green Party run was, to them, a self-centered campaign that blew a crucial hole in Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances, eating up money and getting Russian support along the way\u2026 Theories I\u2019ve heard from top Democrats include that Gabbard is trying to get a TV show\u2014\u201cI already know which network: Fox,\u201d one senior Democrat not affiliated with any campaign said, speaking anonymously to remain publicly neutral\u2014and that she\u2019s gearing up for a Trump-benefiting third-party run. \u201cGreen Party. Willing to take bets on this,\u201d Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden tweeted last week after Gabbard appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show to trash the Democratic National Committee because she hadn\u2019t qualified for the September debate. Gabbard later tweeted the clip with the banner \u201cNo transparency = no trust.\u201d (Gabbard has said publicly, and confirmed to me, that she will run only as a Democrat, but when I repeated that to Tanden, she remained skeptical.)\n\nIs that her game, winning over the hearts of Fox News fans with guest shots on Tucker, broadsides at Kamala Harris, and support for abortion regulations in the third trimester? I don\u2019t know how well a \u201cTulsi!\u201d show on Fox would fare if Trump ended up bombing Iran after all and the adamantly anti-war Gabbard had to face the Fox audience in \u201crally \u2019round the flag\u201d mode. And if ingratiating herself to Fox viewers while damaging her chances at the Democratic nomination is her new aim, she\u2019d have been better off renouncing support for abortion altogether. \u201cI oppose it in the third trimester\u201d is a nice start but still leaves Gabbard in the position of supporting the vast majority of abortions in the U.S.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, there\u2019s no meaningful constituency for her position in a Democratic primary. Black Democrats are often called socially conservative by pundits, which may be true relative to the fringy weirdness of leftists on an array of \u201cvalues\u201d issues. But black Protestants support abortion in all or most cases to the tune of 64 percent, a higher percentage than white mainline Protestants. Overall, 82 percent of Democrats favor abortion rights in all or most instances. Gabbard\u2019s in roughly the same position here as a Republican candidate who supports abortion rights in the first trimester: Most pro-lifers wouldn\u2019t dare vote for that person even though his or her position on the issue is \u201cmoderate\u201d since they wouldn\u2019t be able to trust the candidate not to \u201cevolve\u201d further once in office. Likewise for pro-choice Dems who want a president who\u2019ll show indomitable resolve in holding the line on abortion rights against Republicans, I assume. To those people, Gabbard\u2019s a nonstarter.\n\nIncreasingly I think she\u2019s just speaking her mind and letting the chips fall where they may, knowing that she has no chance at the nomination and believing/hoping that American politics will catch up with her in a few years. She\u2019d be one of the more compelling politicians in the country if not for her Assad baggage. Maybe she\u2019ll renounce that over the next few years, reposition herself as an unorthodox Democrat, and test her luck in 2024 with the benefit of higher name recognition and a national political scene that seems to be in constant flux. Gabbard\u2019s just 38 years old. Going her own way on issues \u2014 within reason \u2014 and refusing to apologize for it might build her a base over time.", "description": "\"Unless a woman\u2019s life or severe health consequences is at risk, then there shouldn\u2019t be an abortion in the third trimester.\u201d", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
