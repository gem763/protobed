crisis fighter at home in halls of power", "language": "en", "text": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 After a career breaking glass ceilings to join a tiny global elite, Christine Lagarde will bring experience of cool-headed crisis fighting to her job as first female head of the European Central Bank.\n\nThe 63-year-old Frenchwoman arrives at the ECB after weathering the financial crisis and its aftershocks at the French finance ministry, in 2007-11, and the International Monetary Fund in 2011-19 \u2014 the first woman to hold both jobs.\n\nShe faced one catastrophic threat after another, from financial sector meltdown in 2008 to the Greek and Argentine debt crises.\n\nFormerly a successful corporate lawyer, Lagarde is praised for tactical nous, levelheaedness and stamina.\n\nHer lack of a formal economics education also leaves her less bound by ideological convictions.\n\nAfter three ECB chiefs well-versed in tinkering with interest rates and soothing the fears of financial markets, she may have to work harder to secure credibility \u2014 a central banker\u2019s most invaluable asset.\n\nBut Lagarde, unused to failure, \u201cknows perfectly well what she has to do\u201d at the ECB, departing chief Mario Draghi said Thursday.\n\nHer one prominent black mark is a \u201cnegligence\u201d conviction over a business arbitration as economy minister that cost taxpayers dearly.\n\nJudges spared her a sentence out of concern for her \u201cinternational reputation\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Rapid rise \u2013\n\nThe daughter of two teachers, Lagarde was a champion synchronised swimmer in her youth.\n\nSome of her zeal for women\u2019s cause may date back to being refused a job as a young lawyer \u201cbecause you are a woman\u201d.\n\nUsually smiling and standing out by her stature and silver bob, Lagarde climbed the ladder into the circles of the powerful.\n\nHer ascent recalls the Latin motto of the elite Holton Arms high school she attended for one year in Maryland, \u201cInveniam viam aut faciam\u201d \u2014 \u201cI will find a way or create one\u201d.\n\nShe only really came to public prominence in 2005, when France\u2019s conservative government tapped the then-president of law firm Baker and McKenzie in its search for fresh faces.\n\nBeginning as trade minister, Lagarde ascended to the economy portfolio two years later, just before the 2008 financial crisis and global recession.\n\nWhen a new IMF chief was needed after former chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn\u2019s sexual assault scandal, she made the leap.\n\nLagarde was soon trotting the globe, selling economic orthodoxy in near-flawless English.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s widely-criticised role in repeated rescues of Greece brought her into close contact with the ECB, while she rarely hesitates to ruffle feathers among her former European partners or to break diplomatic protocol.\n\nIn her private life, Lagarde is an item with French businessman Xavier Giocanti, after splitting from the father of her two sons.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Adults in the room\u2019 \u2013\n\nFrom marking her political career in France, Lagarde\u2019s habit of speaking her mind took on new dimensions on the international stage.\n\nShe once urged austerity-battered Greeks to \u201cpay their taxes\u201d to help end the government\u2019s fiscal woes, as well as at one point bemoaning the lack of \u201cadults in the room\u201d at talks with Athens and its creditors.\n\nGreeks have also targeted her for the harshest criticism, with the leftist Syriza government once accusing the IMF of \u201ccriminal responsibility\u201d for the country\u2019s troubles.\n\nLagarde attempted to learn from the Greece crisis in dealings with Argentina, placing responsibility for reforms firmly on Buenos Aires\u2019 shoulders.\n\nWhile the country is struggling to repay its record $57 billion loan from the IMF, she insisted last month that things would be \u201ca lot worse\u201d if the fund had not intervened.\n\nAthletic, a vegetarian and a non-smoker, Lagarde is also known for offering glimpses of her personal life like her poor English as a teenager, her two failed attempts to enter the elite French civil service school ENA and her habit of undercover exercises for stomach and bottom muscles.\n\nIn a recent interview with US broadcaster CBS, she even showed off her poker-faced technique for appearing to drink wine without swallowing a drop.\n\nWeeks before, she had stood before the assembled IMF staff and guests to sing French megastar Edith Piaf\u2019s \u201cJe ne regrette rien\u201d \u2014 \u201cI regret nothing\u201d.", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 After a career breaking glass ceilings to join a tiny global elite, Christine Lagarde will bring experience of
