While Drew Scott got married back in May 2018, his brother and fellow HGTV star Jonathan Scott has remained single. Whether or not Jonathan was specifically waiting for Zooey Deschanel to announced her divorce from producer Jacob Pechenik last week, he made the right choice by staying on the market, like some kind of\u2026good\u2026house. Look, we\u2019re not the home renovators. They are. According to People, Scott and Deschanel were spotted on a date Friday in Los Angeles and photographed holding hands, the tell-tale sign of dating. Imagine. If Jonathan Scott had accepted even one of ABC\u2019s offers to be The Bachelor, this might never have happened. And if he accepts one now, it\u2019ll be the set-up to the kind of quirky Zooey Deschanel rom-com the nation has been craving as of late.", "description": "Zooey Deschanel is reportedly dating Property Brothers star, interior designer Jonathan Scott, after being photographed on a date in L.A.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/13-Zooey-Deschanel.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
