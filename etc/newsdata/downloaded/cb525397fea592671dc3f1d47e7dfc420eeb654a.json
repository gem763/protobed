Officials in Malaysia have banned the movie altogether after the distributor refused a request to cut the scene. The Philippines government has also objected to the movie.\n\nThe South China Sea has been a major source of contention between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors for decades. In 2016, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China can\u2019t claim rights to most of the sea, a decision that China rejected.\n\nOther countries that dispute China\u2019s claims include Brunei and Taiwan.\n\nIn the past decade, Hollywood studios have developed increasingly close business ties with China, which is the world\u2019s second largest movie market.\n\nAuthorities in Beijing put strict limits on the number of foreign films that can be shown on local screens, and studios hoping to land their moves in those coveted slots have grown increasingly wary of offending Chinese censors.\n\nTo help secure a release in China, Hollywood studios will often partner with a Chinese company to co-produce a movie, which is what the Comcast-owned DreamWorks Animation did in the case of Abominable.\n\nThe entertainment industry\u2019s appeasement of China\u2019s Communist Party has become so pronounced that the animated series South Park recently lampooned the issue in a recent episode, \u201cBand in China.\u201d\n\nDisney\u2019s ESPN recently forbade its journalists from discussing the Hong Kong protests while on air, after the Houston Rockets general manager expressed support for the pro-democracy demonstrators.\n\nDisney chairman and CEO Bob Iger recently said that \u201ccaution is imperative\u201d when discussing China and that taking a position that could harm the company would be \u201ca big mistake.\u201d\n\nAbominable has grossed a lackluster $54.6 million in the U.S. since being released last month. Ironically, the movie has been a box-office disappointment in China, bringing in just $14.8 million since opening earlier this month.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
