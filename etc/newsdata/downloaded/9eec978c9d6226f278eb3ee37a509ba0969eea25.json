And on a daily basis, headlines related to a potential trade deal are still the biggest mover of the stock market.\n\nBut on a company-specific basis, it is hard to find many companies being hit in a wider variety of ways than toymaker Hasbro (HAS).\n\nOn Tuesday, Hasbro reported earnings that missed estimates, with the company laying the blame on tariffs. In response, shares on Tuesday plunged by as much as 15%.\n\nHasbro CEO Brian Goldner called the current environment \u201cvery choppy\u201d on the company\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday morning. Goldner added that \u201cretailer order patterns have changed in response to potential tariffs, and our supply chain is being pushed to meet high levels of demand in condensed periods of time.\u201d\n\nThe mere threat of tariffs has been enough for Hasbro's customers to change their behavior, and for the company's bottom line to get hit. In other words, Hasbro doesn't even need to pay higher taxes on imported or exported goods to feel the pain of the trade war.\n\nThat merely anticipating new duties has hurt Hasbro's outlook so dramatically makes it the trade war's biggest loser right now.\n\nAlmost every executive team can find a way to massage any one quarter or year's numbers to mitigate the impact of a new cost. It's when a potential futures costs continue to remain\u2014 well, potential \u2014 that companies really have problems, and investors start to get antsy.\n\nAnd this news makes Hasbro stand out even more on a day when companies like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB) offered results that hardly mentioned the expected impact from the trade fight.\n\n(AUSTRALIA OUT) Monopoly board game with a piece stopped on 'Tax', 6 April 1998.

Comparing it to the fortunes of P&G and Kimberly Clark is not entirely fair to either party.\n\nBut as we continue to see third quarter results roll in, and investors try to make sense of how companies are handling the trade fight, Hasbro gives us a sense of the biggest negative from Trump's trade war. Which is that it's not really about the tariffs themselves, but about what the threat of these tariffs can mean to companies.\n\n\u201cThe threat of, and the implementation of tariffs in certain instances, impacted our shipments, and our ability to fully meet demand,\u201d Goldner said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDuring Q3 alone we saw multiple different dates for the enactment of list 4 tariffs come and be delayed, now scheduled for December 15, and yet the prospect had our retailers cancel major direct import program orders and rewrite many of these orders as domestic shipments,\u201d the CEO added.\n\nAs Trump changes his mind on trade so too are companies changing their plans. But each zig and zag in the trade war\u2019s drama leaves someone holding the bag.\n\nAnd this quarter, it was Hasbro.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
