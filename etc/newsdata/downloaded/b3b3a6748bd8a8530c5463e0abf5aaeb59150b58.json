In the harbourside district of Tsim Sha Tsui, a masked man walked dressed in a banana costume, the word \"Revolt\" emblazoned on its front.\n\nBut in Sheung Shui, close to the Chinese border, AFP reporters saw groups of masked protesters smashing the windows of businesses either owned by mainland Chinese entities or thought to be supportive of Beijing.\n\nPolice officers - many of whom had their faces covered and were not wearing identification numbers - were seen tackling a young couple wearing masks in the district of Central.\n\nCrowds shouted \"triads\" at the police and the couple were eventually released. But another masked man was handcuffed and led away soon after.\n\nMonths of chaos\n\nHong Kong has been battered by four months of increasingly violent pro-democracy protests.\n\n\n\nThe rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland, which fuelled fears of an erosion of liberties promised under the 50-year \"one country, two systems\" model China agreed ahead of the 1997 handover by Britain.\n\nAfter Beijing and local leaders took a hard line, the demonstrations snowballed into a wider movement calling for more democratic freedoms and police accountability.\n\nLam has refused major concessions, but struggled to come up with any political solution, leaving police and demonstrators to fight increasingly violent battles as the city tips into recession.\n\nHong Kong witnessed its worst clashes to date on Tuesday as China celebrated 70 years of Communist Party rule, with a teenager shot and wounded by police as he attacked an officer.\n\nOn Friday, Lam used a colonial-era law to ban face masks at protests, triggering another wave of mass protests and vows of defiance.\n\nIn the northern district of Yuen Long, a plainclothes police officer opened fire when he was surrounded in his car and attacked by protesters, a petrol bomb exploding at his feet.\n\nPolice on Saturday confirmed a 14-year-old boy had been shot in the leg, taken to hospital and then arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer and rioting.\n\nCity grinds to a halt\n\nHong Kong's subway network, which carries some four million people daily, remained out of action throughout Saturday, while major malls, Chinese banks and supermarket chains announced they were closing.\n\nEven the ubiquitous 7-Eleven stores - which usually operate 24 hours - said they would close their doors citywide later in the afternoon.\n\nLong lines formed at supermarkets throughout the day as residents stocked up, many shelves quickly stripped of meat, rice, toilet paper and other essentials.\n\nWhile the increased vandalism has shocked many in a city unused to such scenes, some moderate activists said they still have sympathy for those using violence.\n\nA 67-year-old property agent, who gave his surname as Luk, was surveying the damage to his local subway station, its windows shattered and walls daubed with graffiti.\n\nHe said he opposed vandalism, but wouldn't condemn those trashing the station.\n\n\"The government will not make any concessions,\" he told AFP. \"The government isn't having a dialogue with citizens, they are just pushing this one-sided behaviour.\"\n\nA French resident, who gave his first name as Marko, described the face mask ban as \"adding oil to the fire\".\n\n\"But I think the people who destroyed the stations are extremists.\"\n\nPro-China lawmakers and police have praised Lam's ban. Beijing has also voiced support, calling it \"extremely necessary\".\n\nBut critics said Lam's move was a major step towards authoritarianism.\n\nThe emergency power, last used by the British in 1967, allows Lam to bypass the city's parliament to make \"any regulation whatsoever\" during an emergency or moment of public danger.", "description": "Masked pro-democracy protesters have marched through Hong Kong in defiance of a ban on face coverings, as much of the city grinds to a halt, with the subway suspended and many shops closed following another night of violence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/67b95f1898b24841b6495c6a1d6b3df3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
