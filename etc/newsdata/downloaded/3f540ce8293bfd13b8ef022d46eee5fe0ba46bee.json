USA TODAY\n\nDenver Broncos quarterback Joe Flacco was none too happy about some of the strategic decisions his coaching staff made down the stretch of Sunday's 15-13 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nAnd he made that very, very clear in his postgame news conference, accusing Vic Fangio and company of being \"afraid to lose\" and \"afraid to be aggressive.\"\n\n\"I just look at it like, we're now a 2-6 football team and we're afraid to go for it in a two-minute drill, you know?\" Flacco told reporters. \"Like, who cares if you give the ball back to the guys with 1:40 left? They obviously got the field goal anyway.\n\n\"And once again: We're a 2-6 football team. And it just feels like we're kind of afraid to lose a game.\"\n\nFlacco's comments referred to the Broncos' penultimate possession of the game, when Denver was up 13-12 with 3:37 to play. The Broncos called four running plays and one short pass before punting the ball back to the Colts, who subsequently marched downfield and kicked the go-ahead field goal.\n\nDenver Broncos quarterback Joe Flacco (5) is sacked by Indianapolis Colts' Ben Banogu (52) during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019, in Indianapolis.

You're just putting your defense in these bad situations and I just felt like, what do we have to lose? Why can't we be aggressive in some of these situations? That's kind of how I feel about a lot of the game today.\"\n\nFlacco, the longtime Baltimore Raven who was acquired by Denver in the offseason, completed 20 of 32 passes on Sunday for 174 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
