That\u2019s the only penalty. The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has balked at calls for his impeachment after he allegedly repeatedly pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a major Ukrainian energy company, when his father was still in office.\n\nMr. Trump has admitted speaking to the Ukranian president in July about Hunter Biden but said he did \u201cabsolutely nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nMr. Weld said the allegations call for Mr. Trump to be removed from office.\n\n\u201cThe grounds for removal of office, impeachment \u2026 are treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about bribery anymore, although I think he\u2019s committed that. We don\u2019t have to worry about other high crimes and misdemeanors, although I think he committed many, he\u2019s such a lawless man. We\u2019ve got treason and we don\u2019t have to dribble around the court, we can go right for the hoop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well past time for this guy, in my opinion, to be carted off to save us all,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s daring us all to let him be totally lawless. He has no respect for the law, he doesn\u2019t understand the law, he has no knowledge base under any issues. Why do we want this man as president of the United States? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
