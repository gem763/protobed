The transfers, in June and July 2018, coincided with the timing of a final tranche of the total 336 million performance shares being issued to management and remain unexplained.\n\nMr Karantzis is also defending a legal dispute with early investors over their right to a portion of performance shares.\n\nThe company is \"actively engaging with the regulators and we are yet to see a question that gives our board or our executive team any cause for concern about our continuous disclosure, our due diligence or our business operations''.\n\nMr Karantzis said iSignthis was due to respond in detail over the next few days to further queries posed by the ASX, and working to lift the suspension as soon as possible.\n\n\"The outlook for the company continues to be extremely positive, with growth prospects in the EU looking favourable well into the future,'' he said.\n\niSignthis provides authentication, payment and settlement services for mainly online businesses. Its annualised processing transaction volume was $1.9 billion, while merchant service fees averaged 1.25 per cent over the quarter.\n\n\"We are very attracted to the economic model of this business, which offers a 'clip the ticket' style revenue model, delivered via scalable software and at very low incremental cost, with the majority of the cost base being fixed in nature,\" fund manager LHC Capital said in a letter to clients.\n\nThe hedge fund, which owns more than 8 per cent of the company, said iSignthis had undergone multiple audits and reviews as part of its integration into the European payments system and acceptance as a principal member of major credit card schemes.", "description": "iSignthis CEO John Karantzis told Goldman Sachs clients he is working towards getting a trading suspension lifted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6637%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_104%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78f8715d138badeedaad57ab640a475ee415602b", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
