Payroll tax is universally regarded as a drag on economic activity and is ultimately paid by employees through lower wages and higher prices for consumers.\n\nAbolishing this tax would remove a huge burden from our economy, put more people into work, and deliver higher productivity.\n\nThe idea was first given an airing in the 2010 Henry Tax Review, which recommended that \u201cstate payroll taxes should eventually be replaced with revenue from more efficient broad-based taxes\u201d. Compensating state and territories for lost revenue could be achieved by broadening the GST or by a modest (but politically courageous) lift in the GST from 10 to 12.5 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis month, we witnessed the federalist revival envisioned in Rebuilding the Federation when NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet announced that the state wanted to \u201cdrive a national vision for the federation that encourages innovation and competition\u201d.\n\nWhen the state and territory treasurers next meet Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, they could abandon their calls for an increase in infrastructure spending and Newstart, and instead stand united in a call for tax reform, which starts with the removal of payroll taxes in exchange for a broader-based consumption tax.", "description": "Federalism helps increase Australia's productivity.
