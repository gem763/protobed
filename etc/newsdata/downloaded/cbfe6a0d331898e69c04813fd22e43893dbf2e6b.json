Another closely watched measure of inflation that strips out food and energy rose 0.3% for the third month in a row.\n\nThe yearly increase in the so-called core rate advanced to 2.4%, matching a 13-month high. The last time the core rate of inflation was higher was in 2008.\n\nThe latest stirring of inflation is unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates next week, but the central bank is watching closely.\n\nRead: Weak unions, globalization not to blame for shrinking slice of income pie for workers\n\nWhat happened: Gas prices fell in August more than they usually do as the summer driving season tapered off. The cost of food was also flat.\n\nPrices rose for medical care, including prescription drugs. The cost of medical care has risen in the past 12 months at the fastest pace in two and a half years.\n\nThe cost of rent, used vehicles, airfares and recreational goods also rose.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, hourly wages jumped 0.4%. They have risen a solid 1.5% in the past year.\n\nRead: U.S. consumers are far from spent and that\u2019s a lifesaver for a wobbly economy\n\nBig picture: Inflation appears to be climbing back toward 2% or even higher after a big drop early in the year, but the Federal Reserve is still on track to cut interest rates next week.\n\nMost Fed officials simply aren\u2019t bothered about inflation right now after years of weak readings. They are more worried about the damage the U.S. trade war with China could cause to the economy. So far tariffs have had little effect on inflation, but the spat has harmed exports and business investment.\n\nIf prices keep rising and the economy continues to slow, however, the Fed could face a quandary later in the year or early in 2020. For now the risks seem low.\n\nRead: For the first time in 11 years, 80% of Americans in their prime are working\n\nMarket reaction: Market reaction:The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.85% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.72% were set to open higher in Thursday trades.
