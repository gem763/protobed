AFRICOM said it did not believe any civilians were injured or killed. This month\u2019s strikes in Libya are the first in more than a year by the U.S. military, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThis ongoing campaign against ISIS-Libya demonstrates that U.S. Africa Command persistently targets terrorist networks that seek to harm innocent Libyans,\u201d said Navy Rear Adm. Heidi Berg, director of intelligence at AFRICOM. \u201cWe will continue to pursue ISIS-Libya and other terrorists in the region, denying them safe haven to coordinate and plan operations in Libya.\u201d\n\nAFRICOM told TIME that for \u201coperational security reasons\u201d it could not disclose whether the coordinates for the airstrike came from U.S. or Libyan intelligence services. \u201cIt is important to preserve operational advantage and not signal to these terror elements when, where, and the various means available to disrupt them,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email.\n\nAn airstrike on Tuesday killed 11 people and a strike Sept. 19 killed eight\u2014all associated with ISIS, AFRICOM said.\n\nHuman rights groups have not called the lack of civilian deaths in Thursday\u2019s strike into question. But the U.S. military has understated civilian death tolls in the past.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition in Syria killed more than 1,600 civilians during the bombardment of Raqqa, Syria in 2017, according to an investigation by Amnesty International and Airwars. The U.S. has publicly admitted responsibility for only 10% of those.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a more precise air campaign in the history of armed conflict,\u201d the commander of the Raqqa operation, Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, wrote at the time. Since July 2019, Townsend has been the commander of AFRICOM.\n\nDonatella Rovera, senior crisis adviser at Amnesty International who led the investigation, suggested Thursday\u2019s airstrike in Libya should be investigated.\n\n\u201cI work on the basis that cases need to be investigated,\u201d she told TIME. \u201cIt may be that their [AFRICOM\u2019s] version of events in Libya is totally accurate, I don\u2019t know. I can tell you about the hundreds of cases I investigated in Syria and Iraq where their version of events was not accurate at all, in a very large number of cases, including practices that they themselves boasted about, notably General Townsend \u2026 honestly some of the statements that he made were really baffling.\u201d\n\nThe Libyan Government of National Accord, based in the northwest of the country, is currently fighting forces led by Khalifa Haftar, a strongman and U.S. citizen who rose to prominence in the northeast of the country amid the civil war that followed the death of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nRecent U.S. strikes against ISIS in Libya have been confined to the sparsely-populated southwest, away from the conflict between Haftar and the Government of National Accord. But ISIS has also been present in the north of the country in the past.\n\n\u201cU.S. Africa Command continues to support diplomatic efforts to stabilize the political situation in Libya in order to maintain our common focus on disrupting terrorist organizations that threaten regional stability,\u201d AFRICOM said in a statement.", "description": "It's the third U.S. strike this month", "authors": ["Billy Perrigo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NjUvBASMWqne4UFRh.4p0A--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/ea281ef001dede536a7a69e5bbc927bb", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
