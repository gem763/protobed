By the 1960s, people were leaving Detroit in droves.\n\nIn 2013, the city filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. Now, more than five years later, more and more programs are seeking to improve the city.\n\nWealthy entrepreneurs are investing in the city too, like Dan Gilbert, the billionaire founder of Quicken Loans. As Business Insider previously reported, after Gilbert moved his company to downtown Detroit in 2010, he started the real-estate firm Bedrock.\n\nNot only is Quicken Loans one of Detroit\u2019s largest employers and taxpayers, but as of 2018, Bedrock had invested or allocated $5.6 billion in roughly 100 properties in downtown Detroit and nearby neighborhoods.\n\nIn June 2017, Vincent Orr purchased this home for his mother through the Detroit Land Bank Authority\u2019s daily auction. It cost him $2,100.\n\nsource Detroit Land Bank Authority\n\nOrr, a native Detroiter, grew up in the same ZIP code where he purchased the home, in the northwestern Detroit neighborhood of Fitzgerald.\n\nOrr graduated from Wayne State University with a degree in media arts and is a production supervisor.\n\n\u201cMy family roots in this neighborhood run pretty deep,\u201d he told Business Insider. \u201cI wanted to stay around and bring it back to the level that I remember it at when I was a child.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I first purchased the house, it was in complete shambles,\u201d he said.\n\ncaption The patio before the renovation. source Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nAccording to the neighbors, the home had been vacant for about 10 years, Orr told Business Insider.\n\nOrr told Business Insider that the porch was torn up, the windows were missing, and the roof was caving in.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the exterior of the home Orr had to worry about \u2014 the interior needed work too. The upgrading process included, among many other steps, replacing pipes and walls.\n\ncaption Pre-renovation. source Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nWhen the home was purchased, the cabinets in the kitchen were worn down and dirty, with parts missing.\n\ncaption The kitchen before the renovation. source Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nOrr told Business Insider that he was able to do most of the work himself.\n\ncaption The pre-renovation bathroom. source Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nAll in all, Orr spent $40,000 over the nine-month renovation process, he told Business Insider.\n\nsource Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nHe installed all the windows, all the doors, and the furnace.\n\nsource Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nHe also handled the plumbing work and the electrical wiring.\n\nsource Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nOrr hired workers only when it came time to install the ductwork for a forced-air central heating system and to repair the roof.\n\nsource Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nThe hardest part of the process was finding contractors, Orr told Business Insider. Though he did most of the work himself, things like finding a roofing company turned out to be more difficult than he expected.\n\nHe even renovated the kitchen himself.\n\ncaption The kitchen before it was renovated. source Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nNow the renovated space sports white cabinets, marble countertops, and new appliances.\n\ncaption The renovated kitchen. source Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nOrr said that checking in with the DLBA went smoothly. To keep the organization up to date, Orr sent images of the home throughout the renovation.\n\nsource Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\n\u201cFor the final inspection, they didn\u2019t have to come out, because I documented everything with photographs and sent it to them. They had been following the process along the way,\u201d Orr told Business Insider.\n\n\u201cYou have to show them evidence of the house being occupied, so you show them furniture in the living room, furniture in the bedrooms, and appliances in the kitchen,\u201d Orr added.\n\nAs soon as the home was completed, Orr\u2019s mother was able to move in. Now, he said, they\u2019re focused on decorating.\n\nsource Vincent Orr/Facebook\n\nIn March, Orr purchased the home next door through the DLBA\u2019s Own It Now platform.

The Detroit Home Mortgage program, which was put in place in 2016, is working to increase homeownership in the city by lending qualified buyers the money needed to both purchase and renovate homes in the city.\n\nThrough the program, Detroiters can receive two loans: The first mortgage is for the appraised value of the home, while the second mortgage, which has a limit of $75,000, closes the gap between the home\u2019s sale price and its appraised value and covers the cost of renovations.", "description": "Business Insider - We caught up with Vincent Orr, a native Detroiter who purchased a home for his mother through a daily auction in June 2017..
