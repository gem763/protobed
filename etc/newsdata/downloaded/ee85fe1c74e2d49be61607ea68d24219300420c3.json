Her mother soon followed suit.\n\nJulie had an impressive four-octave singing voice which was soon put to profitable use\n\nAndrews, who never had time for much formal education, was 15 when she discovered her biological father was a family friend with whom her mother had had an affair.\n\nTed Andrews tried twice, when drunk, to get into bed with her. She prudently fitted a lock to her bedroom door.\n\nStarring roles in the West End meant Andrews was the family's main breadwinner when she was in her teens and able to buy the family home for them.\n\nA red-hot scene left her weak at the knees\n\nAndrews was in her late 20s when she moved into films, but admits that she was still painfully naive about men.\n\nMary Poppins, her first film, didn't make any calls on her romantically, but The Americanisation Of Emily, a wartime comedy drama also made in 1964, involved filming her first love scene.\n\nLuckily it was with James Garner, one of Hollywood's most charming male stars. Andrews, then 28, admits she was shaking at the prospect of their on-screen love-making.\n\nAndrews, then 28, admits she was shaking at the prospect of their on-screen love-making with James Garner\n\n'Terrified. I had no idea what one was supposed to do with a kiss and all of that,' she told ABC TV recently.\n\n'James Garner, who was delicious, made it very easy and I began to feel it's getting very hot in here.'\n\nShe went on: 'I thought I can manage this, and I got up and my legs buckled because it really had hit me rather hard.'\n\nAsked if she knew much about men at the time, she laughs: 'No I didn't!'\n\nHills were alive with the sound of chopper blades\n\nThe 1965 musical The Sound Of Music is cherished for Andrews joyfully singing 'the hills are alive with the sound of music', as she runs through an Alpine meadow in the movie's opening scene.\n\nHairy experience: Andrews as Maria in The Sound of Music\n\nFilming it, with the cameraman hanging out of a helicopter, certainly wasn't joyful, she says.\n\n'As the helicopter drew closer, I spun around with my arms open as if about to sing,' she recalls. 'All I had to do was walk, twirl and take a breath.'\n\nUnfortunately, as she completed her twirl, the downdraught from the helicopter's blades was so powerful it hurled her to the ground.\n\n'I'd haul myself up, spitting mud and grass and brushing off my dress and trek back to my starting position,' she recalls.\n\n'Each time the helicopter encircled me, I was flattened again. It took nine takes. Finally, the shot was deemed acceptable and I was grateful to return to my hotel and take a hot bath.'\n\nEven her hairdo was beset by misfortune. Her blonde crop was designed to cover up a hairstyling mishap that had turned her brown hair orange.\n\nAndrews admits she found the story 'too sentimental and saccharine and over the top' when she first saw it as a musical on Broadway: 'I mean, you have mountains and nuns and seven children \u2014 but all together?'\n\nJulie lights up in 1967's Thoroughly Modern Millie\n\nUncle Walt was left blushing\n\n'I swear a lot,' Andrews admitted recently. While filming Mary Poppins \u2014 released in 1964 \u2014 she was supposed to fly through the air on a flywire, but ended up hurtling to the floor 'like a ton of bricks'.\n\nAs a result, she says: 'I think I said a few words he [producer 'Uncle' Walt Disney] had not heard very often.'\n\nA few words? Karen Dotrice, who played her young charge Jane Banks, described her shock as an eight-year-old at seeing Andrews, then 28 \u2014 in full prim Edwardian costume \u2014 smoking a cigarette and exchanging some blue language with the film crew.\n\nAndrews also admits that she can be feisty, saying: 'I've got a good right hook.'\n\nTopless in a 'porn' shocker\n\nHaving played a magical nanny (and a novice nun-turned-nanny), Julie Andrews was determined to shed her saccharine-sweet image.\n\nShe once told an interviewer: 'Does Mary Poppins have an orgasm? Does she go to the bathroom? I assure you, she does.'\n\nShe got her wish in 1981's S.O.B., a satire of Hollywood made by husband Blake Edwards, in which she bared her breasts.\n\nAndrews played a squeaky-clean film star in S.O.B., a satire of Hollywood made by husband Blake Edwards, in which she bared her breasts\n\nShe played a squeaky-clean film star who allows her director husband to turn their floundering film into a soft porn movie.\n\nFeaturing a head-in-the-oven suicide attempt, an orgy, cross-dressing and giant erotic toys, the film had mixed reviews but cinemagoers never saw Andrews in quite the same way again.\n\nThe 'dangerous' older man she fell for\n\nAndrews learned quickly about men in Hollywood. She had moved there with first husband Tony Walton and their daughter Emma but the couple drifted apart because of work. She was making The Sound Of Music as they were heading towards divorce.\n\nTo save her marriage, she reveals in her memoir, Home Work, she saw a psychoanalyst and briefly thought about giving up acting and singing.\n\nAs she was leaving the therapist's office one day, she met her next husband, Blake Edwards, while he was driving through LA in his Rolls.\n\nFirst love: Andrews moved to Hollywood with first husband Tony Walton and their daughter Emma but the couple drifted apart because of work\n\n'I was trying very hard not to fall in love with him,' she says of the director of Breakfast At Tiffany's and the Pink Panther films.\n\n'He was devastatingly funny, wicked even, but there was something dangerous about him.'\n\nHe was 13 years her senior and it took her two years to agree to marry him, in 1969.\n\nBetween them, they had five children \u2014 Emma, Edwards's two, Jennifer and Geoffrey, and two adopted Vietnamese girls, Amy and Joanna.\n\nVolatile: Andrews's second husband, director Blake Edwards, was 13 years her senior\n\nAndrews became a real-life nanny with Blake, who was beset by gall bladder problems, chest pains, infectious mononucleosis (called 'the kissing disease'), back pain and flu.\n\n'Yes, very stressful times, always,' she says. They were together until his death from pneumonia in 2010.", "description": "Anyone who has seen the classic Disney musical Mary Poppins starring Julie Andrews may well have noticed the hint of sauciness about the morally-upstanding nanny in London.", "authors": ["Tom Leonard For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/22/19667048-0-image-a-54_1571001521298.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
