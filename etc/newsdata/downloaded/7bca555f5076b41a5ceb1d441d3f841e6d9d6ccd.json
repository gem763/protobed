Forecasters warned that Dorian could generate a storm surge as high as seven metres.\n\nBahamas Police Chief Samuel Butler urged people to remain calm and share their GPS co-ordinates, but he said rescue crews had to wait until weather conditions improved.\n\n\"We simply cannot get to you,\" he told Bahamas radio station ZNS, which shared reports from callers who said some people were stuck on roofs and in attics.\n\nAs many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.\n\nHere are the 5 PM EDT Key Messages for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dorian?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dorian</a>.

Forecasters expected Dorian to stay just off shore, but meteorologist Daniel Brown cautioned that \"only a small deviation\" could draw the storm's dangerous core toward land.\n\nAt 5 p.m. ET Monday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported the storm's top sustained winds were at 230 km/h and that Dorian was barely moving at all. It was located 40 kilometres northeast of Freeport, Bahama island.\n\nAmerican Airlines says it has cancelled 375 flights through Wednesday due to Dorian. It said operations have been suspended at seven airports it flies to in Florida and the Bahamas, and that there could be additional issues and delays throughout the week at other East Coast airports.\n\nTo help people evacuate the region, American said it would cap single-leg main cabin fares from all cities covered by travel alerts in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. It's also waiving fees for bags and pets.\n\nFort Lauderdale Airport has ceased commercial flight operations until further notice. Orlando International says it will cease operations at 2 a.m. ET Tuesday morning.\n\n'Not good'\n\nHouses in a neighborhood in Freeport were engulfed by 1.8 metres of water. \"It looks like they're boats on top of the water,\" said Rosa Knowles-Bain, 61, a resident who fled two days ago to an emergency shelter.\n\nInformation began emerging from the affected islands, with Bahamas Power and Light saying there is a total blackout in New Providence, the archipelago's most populous island.\n\n\"The reports out of Abaco [Island] as everyone knows were not good,\" company spokesperson Quincy Parker told ZNS Bahamas radio station.\n\nStrong wind from Hurricane Dorian blow the tops of trees while whisking up water from the surface of a canal in Freeport Monday. (Tim Aylen/The Associated Press)\n\nMeanwhile, Don Cornish, island administrator for Grand Bahama Island, told The Associated Press that officials received many calls from people in distress about flooded homes.\n\nMost people went to shelters as the storm neared. Tourist hotels shut down and residents boarded up their homes. But many people were expected to be left homeless.\n\nWatch video posted to social media that shows a Bahamas resort being hit by high winds:\n\nVideo posted to social media shows a resort in the Bahamas being hit by high winds, lightning and heavy rain as Dorian hits the area. 1:08\n\n\"It's devastating,\" Joy Jibrilu, director general of the Bahamas' Ministry of Tourism and Aviation, said Sunday afternoon. \"There has been huge damage to property and infrastructure. Luckily, no loss of life reported.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Dorian's maximum sustained winds reached 297 km/h, with gusts up to 354 km/h, tying the record for the most powerful Atlantic hurricane to ever make landfall.\n\nThat equalled the Labour Day hurricane of 1935, before storms were named. The only recorded storm that was more powerful was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with 305 km/h winds, though it did not make landfall at that strength.\n\nCurving toward U.S. seaboard\n\nForecasters said Dorian was most likely to begin pulling away from the Bahamas early Tuesday and curving to the northeast, parallel to the U.S. southeast seaboard. The system is expected to spin 64 to 80 kilometres off Florida, with hurricane-force wind speeds extending about 60 kilometres to the west.\n\nCanada's Global Affairs is advising Canadians to avoid all travel to the Bahamas and to the east coast of Florida, from north of Deerfield Beach to the mouth of the St. Mary's River.\n\nDue to disruptions in telecommunications caused by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HurricaneDorian?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HurricaneDorian</a> in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bahamas?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bahamas</a>, Canadians in need of emergency consular assistance should call the Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa directly at +1 613 996 8885. <a href=\"https://t.co/dKYMMJjdSb\">pic.twitter.com/dKYMMJjdSb</a> \u2014@CanadainBahamas\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued an order Sunday for the mandatory evacuation of his state's entire coast. The order, which covers about 830,000 people, was to take effect at noon Monday, at which point state troopers were to make all lanes on major coastal highways one-way heading inland.\n\n\"We can't make everybody happy, but we believe we can keep everyone alive,\" McMaster said.\n\nGeorgia, North Carolina warn residents\n\nA few hours later, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp ordered mandatory evacuations for the state's Atlantic coast, also starting at midday Monday.\n\nAuthorities in Florida ordered mandatory evacuations in some vulnerable coastal areas. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned his state it could see heavy rain, winds and floods later in the week.\n\nJoseph Spivey and his son Carson lay sand bags in preparation for Hurricane Dorian in St. Augustine, Florida Monday.

One showed floodwaters rushing through the streets of an unidentified town at nearly the height of a car roof.\n\nIn some parts of Abaco, \"you cannot tell the difference as to the beginning of the street versus where the ocean begins,\" Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said. According to the Nassau Guardian, he called it \"probably the most sad and worst day of my life to address the Bahamian people.\"\n\nThis was just sent to me from a Canadian whose parents are in the Abacos Islands in the Bahamas where Category 5, Hurricane Dorian has made landfall. This video was taken this morning. <br>The National Hurricane Centre says to expect \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/TRa70hUkRb\">pic.twitter.com/TRa70hUkRb</a> \u2014@JudyTrinhCBC\n\nThe Bahamas archipelago is no stranger to hurricanes. Homes are required to have metal reinforcements for roof beams to withstand winds into the upper limits of a Category 4 hurricane, and compliance is generally tight for those who can afford it. Risks are higher in poorer neighbourhoods, with wooden homes in low-lying areas.\n\nElsewhere across the Atlantic, things are looking quite active. NHC is monitoring 4 other disturbances, with 2 or 3 of them likely to become tropical cyclones during the next 5 days.

The same area was put under a storm surge watch. Lake Okeechobee was under a tropical storm watch.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders for low-lying and flood-prone areas and mobile homes were in effect starting either Sunday or Monday from Palm Beach County north to at least the Daytona Beach area, and some counties to the north issued voluntary evacuation notices. Weekend traffic was light in Florida despite those orders, unlike during the chaotic run-up to Hurricane Irma in 2017 when the unusually broad storm menaced the entire state.\n\nKen Graham, director of the hurricane centre, urged people not to bet on safety just because the forecast track had the storm a bit offshore.\n\nWith every new forecast, \"we keep nudging [Dorian's track] a little bit to the left,\" said Graham, which is closer to the Florida coast.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian continued to pound the Bahamas on Monday, barely moving, as it pummelled the islands with a fearsome assault that shredded roofs, hurled cars and forced even rescue crews to take shelter.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268165.1567458537!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/storm-dorian.jpg"}
