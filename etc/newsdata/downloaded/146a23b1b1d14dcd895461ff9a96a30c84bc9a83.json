Devan Dubnyk stopped 30 shots for the Wild, who beat the Senators 2-0 in Ottawa on Monday for their first win of 2019-20.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mriles4?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mriles4</a>\u2019s four helpers in the middle frame tied the Leafs franchise record for assists in a period!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LeafsForever?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LeafsForever</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/W81l88vZgS\">pic.twitter.com/W81l88vZgS</a> \u2014@MapleLeafs\n\n\"It was definitely not the second period we wanted,\" Dubnyk said. \"You want to try and find a way out of that better than we did.\"\n\nMinnesota head coach Bruce Boudreau lamented his veteran roster's lack of foot speed, which was evident all night against the high-powered Leafs.\n\n\"I wish I had a magic potion to make everybody faster,\" Boudreau said. \"But I don't. That's why you've got to grind it out.\"\n\nThe Wild weren't able to do that after their encouraging first.\n\nTavares got things going at 1:58 of the second when he wired a slapshot off the post and in on Dubnyk with Marner in front for his second of the season.\n\nChanges to Leafs' top line\n\nThe goal came after Babcock moved Trevor Moore up to play with Tavares and Marner, while Kasperi Kapanen slid down the lineup to join Alexander Kerfoot and Ilya Mikheyev.\n\n\"I've just been watching it ... no one seemed to be going,\" Babcock said of the switch. \"Tried it and it seemed to be OK, so we just stayed with it.\"\n\nMarner then gave the Leafs, who visit the Washington Capitals on Wednesday, their first lead on a power play at 7:17 when he fired a shot through the pads that Dubnyk could only get a piece of for his third.\n\nThe Wild, who will play 13 of their first 18 games on the road, appeared to have a good chance to get back even, but Ryan Hartman pulled down Leafs defenceman Jake Muzzin with Ryan Donato off to the races on a breakaway.\n\nDubnyk reacts after one of the Leafs' four second-period goals. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press)\n\nHartman, who had taken a big hit moments earlier, accused Muzzin of diving.\n\n\"It was embarrassing,\" said the winger. \"He knows what happened.\"\n\nBoudreau said Hartman has to keep his cool in that situation.\n\n\"He can blame Muzzin all night,\" he said. \"There was no need for it.\"\n\nPower play strikes twice\n\nToronto made the visitors pay just 10 seconds later when Johnsson batted a puck out of the air at 8:29 as the Leafs connected on two of their three man-advantage opportunities after coming in just 5-for-22.\n\n\"We wanted to get our power play going,\" Marner said. \"That was huge.\"\n\nThe home side went up 4-1 at 13:05 when Matthews scored his seventh on a pretty give-and-go with Marner after Dubnyk, who entered 0-4-0 with a 4.56 goals-against average and .862 save percentage, made the initial save.\n\nLucky number 7 for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AM34?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AM34</a> \ud83c\udfb0\ud83d\udd25<br>7 games.<br>7 goals.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LeafsForever?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LeafsForever</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/U2sKv9iqMS\">pic.twitter.com/U2sKv9iqMS</a> \u2014@MapleLeafs\n\nAndersen stopped Marcus Foligno on a breakaway in the final minute of the second at the other end, and had to be sharp five minutes into the third on a 3-on-1 rush when he robbed Zach Parise.\n\nJohnsson nearly got his second of the evening later in the period, but his blast from the hash marks rattled the crossbar.\n\nMayhew, who was making his NHL debut, scored late for the Wild, but Toronto improved to 2-2-1 at home and picked up its first victory at Scotiabank Arena since beating Ottawa in the season opener.\n\nHaving played just once at home, the Wild went up 1-0 at 5:29 when Kunin fired his second through a screen on Andersen.\n\nThe Leafs snapped a 0-2-1 stretch with Saturday's 5-2 road victory in Detroit over the Red Wings, and had a couple of opportunities to get even, but Dubnyk was there before the floodgates eventually opened after the intermission.\n\n\"It wasn't a terrible first period, but we still felt we had a lot more,\" Tavares said. \"It seemed like when we got that first one [and] drew some penalties, we were able to open the game up and put some pressure on.\"", "description": "Mitch Marner had a goal and two assists as the Toronto Maple Leafs overcame another slow start to down the Minnesota Wild 4-2 on Tuesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322246.1571190259!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tavares-marner-matthews-101519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
