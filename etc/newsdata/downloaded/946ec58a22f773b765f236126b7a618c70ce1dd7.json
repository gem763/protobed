Beyond this, many people seek out different foods specifically for their health benefits, hoping eating certain things might prevent or treat particular conditions. Here are five options that aren't nearly as beneficial as their reputation suggests.\n\nIt\u2019s true many foods contain \u201cbioactive compounds\u201d \u2013 chemicals that act in the body in ways that might promote good health. These are being studied in the prevention of cancer, heart disease and other conditions.\n\nBut the idea of food as medicine, although attractive, is easily oversold in the headlines. Stories tend to be based on studies done in the lab, testing concentrated extracts from foods. The effect seen in real people eating the actual food is going to be different to the effects in a petri dish.\n\nIf you do the maths, you\u2019ll find you actually need to eat enormous amounts of particular foods to get an active dose of the desired element. In some cases, this might endanger your health, rather than protecting it.\n\nThese four foods (and one drink) show the common healing claims around the foods we eat don\u2019t always stack up.\n\nCinnamon\n\nCinnamon, which contains a compound called cinnamaldehyde, is claimed to aid weight loss and regulate appetite.\n\nThere is evidence cinnamaldehyde can reduce cholesterol in people with diabetes. But this is based on studies of the chemical in large doses \u2013 not eating the spice itself.\n\nThese studies give people between 1 and 6 grams of cinnamaldehyde per day. Cinnamon is about 8% cinnamaldehyde by weight \u2013 so you\u2019d have to eat at least 13 grams of cinnamon, or about half a supermarket jar, per day. Much more than you\u2019d add to your morning porridge.\n\nRed wine\n\nThe headlines on the health benefits of red wine are usually because of a chemical in grape skins called resveratrol. Resveratrol is a polyphenol, a family of chemicals with antioxidant properties.\n\nIt\u2019s been claimed resveratrol protects our cells from damage and reduces the risk of a range of conditions such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and heart disease.\n\nThere is some limited evidence that resveratrol has benefits in animal models, although studies done in humans have not shown a similar effect.\n\nIt varies by wine, but red wine contains about 3 micrograms (about 3 millionths of a gram) of resveratrol per bottle. The studies that have shown a benefit from resveratrol use at least 0.1 grams per day (that\u2019s 100,000 micrograms).\n\nTo get that much resveratrol, you\u2019d have to drink roughly 200 bottles of wine a day. We can probably all agree that\u2019s not very healthy.\n\nBlueberries\n\nBlueberries, like red wine, are a source of resveratrol, but at a few micrograms per berry you\u2019d have to eat more than 10,000 berries a day to get the active dose.\n\nBlueberries also contain compounds called anthocyanins, which may improve some markers of heart disease. But to get an active dose there you\u2019re looking at 150-300 blueberries per day. More reasonable, but still quite a lot of fruit \u2013 and expensive.\n\nChocolate\n\nThe news that dark chocolate lowers blood pressure is always well-received. Theobromine, a chemical in chocolate has been shown to lower blood pressure in doses of about 1 gram of the active compound, but not at lower doses. Depending on the chocolate, you could be eating 100g of dark chocolate before you reached this dose.\n\nChocolate is a discretionary food, or \u201cjunk food\u201d. The recommended serve for discretionary foods is no more than 600 kilojoules per day, or 25g of chocolate. Eating 100g of chocolate would be equivalent to more than 2,000kJ.\n\nExcess kilojoule consumption leads to weight gain, and being overweight increases risk of heart disease and stroke. So these risks would likely negate the benefits of eating chocolate to lower your blood pressure.\n\nTurmeric\n\nTurmeric is a favourite. It\u2019s good in curries, and recently we\u2019ve seen hype around the tumeric latte. Stories pop up regularly about its healing power, normally based on curcumin.\n\nCurcumin refers to a group of compounds, called curcuminoids, that might have some health benefits, like reducing inflammation. Inflammation helps us to fight infections and respond to injuries, but too much inflammation is a problem in diseases like arthritis, and might be linked to other conditions like heart disease or stroke.\n\nHuman trials on curcumin have been inconclusive, but most use curcumin supplementation in very large doses of 1 to 12 grams per day. Turmeric is about 3% curcumin, so for each gram of tumeric you eat you only get 0.03g of curcumin. This means you\u2019d have to eat more than 30g of tumeric to get the minimum active dose of tumeric.\n\nImportantly, curcumin in turmeric is not very bioavailable. This means we only absorb about 25% of what we eat, so you might actually have to eat well over 100g of turmeric, every day, to get a reasonable dose of curcumin. That\u2019s a lot of curry.\n\nWhat to eat then?\n\nWe all want food to heal us, but focusing on single foods and eating mounds of them is not the answer. Instead, a balanced and diverse diet can provide foods each with a range of different nutrients and bioactive compounds. Don\u2019t get distracted by quick fixes; focus instead on enjoying a variety of foods.\n\nEmma Beckett, Postdoctoral Fellow (Human Molecular Nutrition), School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle and Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, PhD Student/Epidemiologist\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\n\nThis story has been updated since its original publication.", "description": "Food gives us the nutrients we need to survive, and we know a balanced diet contributes to good health.
