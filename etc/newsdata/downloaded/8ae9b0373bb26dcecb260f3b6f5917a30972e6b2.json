All the polls had given Mrs. Clinton the win as well. The anti-Trumpers emerged immediately to contest Mr. Trump\u2019s victory; this was not supposed to have happened.

We must create a means to have him removed from office.\n\nThis removal attempt has been ongoing for nearly three years now. Well, guess what?
