The revelation prompted a rush of moderate House Democrats to call for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, a step they had resisted for months. On Tuesday, Pelosi (D-Calif.) relented as well.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi said in a brief statement before a backdrop of American flags, repeatedly invoking the nation\u2019s founders. \u201cTherefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe confrontation between the Democratic-led House and Trump is likely to further divide a polarized nation ahead of the 2020 election while carrying implications for both parties. It remains unclear, however, who will capi\u00adtal\u00adize politically over the next 14 months.\n\n[What you need to know about the impeachment inquiry into Trump]\n\nTrump immediately lashed out at the Democrats, tweeting, \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\u201d\n\nThe White House also scrambled to respond, announcing plans to release on Wednesday the transcript of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nCongressional Republicans rallied to the president\u2019s defense, arguing impeachment would only motivate GOP voters.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a statement that Democrats \u201chave been trying to reverse the results of the 2016 election since President Trump took office. For them, this is all about politics. Not about facts.\u201d\n\nPelosi and many in her caucus had resisted calls for impeachment from the party\u2019s liberal base and several of the 2020 presidential candidates, citing the absence of public support and GOP backing.\n\nBut over seven days, the revelations that the president sought the help of Zelensky to investigate Biden infuriated Democrats, particularly lawmakers with national security credentials.\n\nTrump has denied pressuring Zelensky by withholding nearly $400 million in foreign aid. Trump said Tuesday that he withheld the money over his concerns that the United States was contributing more to Ukraine than European countries were.\n\nThe launch of an impeachment inquiry follows an intense 24-hour period in which 57 Democrats \u2014 including moderates from Trump districts who had long opposed impeachment \u2014 endorsed proceedings. In total, 196 Democrats support an impeachment inquiry, according to a Washington Post analysis \u2014 and the number is continuing to grow.\n\nIn a sign of the gravity of the situation, Rep. John Lewis, an influential member in the caucus, was one of the latest Democrats to back impeachment Tuesday. The Georgia Democrat, a staunch Trump critic and close Pelosi ally, had declined for months to weigh in out of respect for the speaker.\n\n\u201cThere comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect and preserve the integrity of our nation. I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come,\u201d Lewis said on the House floor. \u201cTo delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.\u201d\n\nCongress has launched impeachment proceedings against a president only four times in the nation\u2019s history. Pelosi\u2019s move all but ensures that the House will vote on articles charging Trump with \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d in a matter of weeks, according to senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\nPelosi personally informed Trump of her decision Tuesday morning. The president, in New York for the U.N. meeting, telephoned the speaker to discuss gun legislation, Pelosi told lawmakers in private meetings.\n\nThe conversation, however, quickly turned to the president\u2019s conversations with the Ukrainian leader. Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration\u2019s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions, according to individuals familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe the conversation.\n\nTrump told Pelosi that he wasn\u2019t the one blocking the complaint. \u201cHe said, \u2018you know, I don\u2019t have anything to do with that,\u2019 \u201d she told her caucus.\n\nShe responded that he had the power to fix it and challenged him to turn over the complaint: \u201cI said, \u2018Well, then undo it.\u2019 Undo it. Because you are asking the DNI to break the law. I mean, it\u2019s just outrageous.\u201d\n\nThe remarkable series of events on Capitol Hill will continue Thursday when the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who held back the whistleblower\u2019s complaint from Congress, testifies before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nWhile the House could vote to impeach Trump, his ouster would require a conviction in the Senate, where Republicans were dismissive of Pelosi\u2019s move as politically motivated.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi\u2019s much-publicized efforts to restrain her far-left conference have finally crumbled. House Democrats cannot help themselves,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u201cInstead of working together across party lines on legislation to help American families and strengthen our nation, they will descend even deeper into their obsession with re-litigating 2016.\u201d\n\nImpeachment has occurred only twice in U.S. history \u2014 against Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Neither was removed from office. President Richard M. Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House initiated impeachment proceedings but before an official vote, stepping down rather than face the embarrassment of such a rebuke.\n\n[Aaron Blake on Post Reports: \u201cObviously, this is a very significant moment, maybe more symbolically than practically.\u201d]\n\nTrump, however, has signaled he is ready for a fight. Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cthe misguided Democrat impeachment strategy is meant to appease their rabid, extreme, leftist base, but will only serve to embolden and energize President Trump\u2019s supporters and create a landslide victory for the President.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans wasted little time blasting out news releases taunting moderate Democrats in Trump districts for supporting impeachment. In a statement, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a PAC dedicated to helping House Republicans, said, \u201cDemocrats feeling euphoric in the moment, will awaken to a nightmarish hangover when they\u2019re forced to defend their decision to their constituents back home.\u201d\n\nProtecting her majority was one of the main reasons Pelosi resisted impeachment until now, arguing that Trump was \u201cjust not worth it.\u201d She had said any move to impeach would require bipartisanship and public support. She currently has neither, though the most recent polling on impeachment was conducted well before the Ukraine controversy erupted.\n\nBefore Pelosi made her announcement Tuesday, the speaker and her leadership team briefly considered the creation of a select committee to conduct the inquiry, with some in leadership questioning whether the House Judiciary Committee was up to the task. But liberals balked at the idea and defended Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and his ability to oversee the proceedings.\n\nBy the time Democrats huddled to discuss the historic move Tuesday afternoon during a somber caucus meeting, they appeared to be united.\n\n\u201cUnlike any other caucus meeting, there was broad consensus \u2014 I did not hear one word of dissent, and that\u2019s the first time that I recall that\u2019s occurred in a discussion of the president,\u201d said House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) upon exiting the meeting.\n\nThe House plans to vote Wednesday on a resolution condemning the administration\u2019s efforts to block the release of the whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump\u2019s promise to a foreign leader constituted an \u201curgent concern\u201d to national security.\n\nIn a rare, albeit subtle protest from the GOP-led Senate, lawmakers adopted a resolution on Tuesday calling for the White House to turn over the complaint to the intelligence committees, as is required under law.\n\nIn a separate move, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said the whistleblower wants to speak to his committee and is seeking guidance from Maguire about how he could do so.\n\n\u201cThe times have found us,\u201d Schiff told his colleagues during the Democratic caucus meeting. \u201cAnd in light of the damning allegations the president has admitted to, the time is now.\u201d\n\nBiden on Tuesday called for Congress to begin impeachment of Trump if the White House continues to stonewall congressional investigations, including questions regarding reports that Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cI can take the political attacks. They\u2019ll come, and they\u2019ll go, and in time, they\u2019ll soon be forgotten. But if we allow a president to get away with shredding the United States Constitution, that will last forever,\u201d Biden said in brief remarks Tuesday afternoon in Wilmington, Del.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "The House speaker\u2019s move came after the president acknowledged urging Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate Joe Biden, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination who holds a wide lead over Trump, polls show, in a potential general election matchup.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Karoun Demirjian", "September At Pm", "Rachael Bade Is A Congress Reporter For The Washington Post", "Primarily Focusing On The House.
