Pictured: HMS Kent, one of the Type 23 frigates\n\nLast night, former First Sea Lord Admiral Lord West said: 'Until recently our ability to put ships to sea has been dramatically better than other navies, so I am surprised that the Type 23s are sailing for such a short time.\n\n'But there has been a steady erosion of capability, a hollowing out of the Royal Navy, fewer spare parts, less logistical support and manpower shortages.'\n\nHMS Montrose, another Type 23 frigate, is currently patrolling the Persian Gulf\n\nDuring questions in Parliament last week, Mr Wallace addressed the issue of idle frigates and how their inactivity made it harder for him to convince the Chancellor to give the Royal Navy more money for ships.\n\nHe said: 'If I had more of our current fleet working, then I would have much more freedom to deploy to meet some of our ambitions and tasks.\n\n'I've made it very clear to the First Sea Lord one of my priorities is to get what we've got working.'\n\nLast night a Royal Navy spokesperson said: 'Type 23 frigates are true workhorses across the globe and have been vital to our missions across the world this year.\n\n'Providing this level of performance requires spells of hard-earned leave and maintenance to enable the ships to retain their warfighting edge.'\n\nHMS Kent and HMS Montrose, both Type 23 frigates, are currently patrolling the Persian Gulf.", "description": "The lack of activity of the Royal Navy's Type 23 frigates, considered their most versatile warship, enraged Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who has since demanded an explanation.", "authors": ["Mark Nicol Defence Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20226452-0-image-a-166_1572124439657.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
