The sewing for the outfit had to be completed on Lopez to ensure that it would stretch and move with the actress, he said, adding that it was \u201ctailored to within an inch of its life.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nUpon first showing the design to Lopez, Travers said he was nervous she\u2019d disapprove of the super-skimpy style, but he explained that he felt it was the right outfit to showcase her physique.\n\n\u201cI held it up, and I said, \u2018I know that this is crazy, but I really believe in this.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Let\u2019s go. I think I do too.\u2019\u201d Travers told Vanity Fair.\n\nThe designer also added that, when compiling costume ideas for the film, he looked to celebrities who were fashion icons back in 2007 \u2014 when the film takes place \u2014 and, naturally, Lopez\u2019s picture kept popping up.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nEven still, Lopez had said earlier this month that she found it \u201creally scary\u201d having to perform \u201cpractically naked\u201d during the striptease scenes. Speaking with Evening Standard magazine, she admitted she also kind of enjoyed the process, which required her to perform in front of hundreds of extras.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something liberating and empowering about it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you\u2019re really out there, physically, emotionally and psychologically.\u201d\n\n\u201cHustlers,\u201d starring Lopez, Constance Wu and Julia Stiles, earned more than $33 million on its opening weekend, reported Variety. The film is loosely based on a 2015 New York Magazine article by Jessica Pressler.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News\u2019 Dom Calicchio contributed to this report.", "description": "Viewers may not have realized it, but there was a lot of thought that went into the design of Jennifer Lopez\u2019s costumes in \u201cHustlers\u201d \u2014 even though there wasn\u2019t exactly much costume to design.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/HUstlersBarbara-NitkeSTXfilms-via-AP13.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
