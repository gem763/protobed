In short, it felt like a manager making an excuse.\n\nDavid Moyes did something similar at Sunderland in 2016. Realising he had made a mistake within weeks of joining the club, Moyes never missed an opportunity to detail the mess he had inherited. A lot of his grumblings were justified.\n\nAll the while, however, he was neglecting what should have been his number one priority of organising and motivating his team. Sunderland were ultimately relegated but Moyes did just about enough to protect his own reputation.\n\nDavid Moyes had consistently grumbled about the mess he inherited at Sunderland in 2016\n\nBruce, similarly, has not been dealt an easy hand. There is definite mitigation in the chaotic nature of his late appointment and the loss of last season's 23-goal strikeforce of Salomon Rondon and Ayoze Perez.\n\nSaying that, Bruce declared himself delighted with the club's 'remarkable' transfer business and, as recently as last week, was lauding the merits of signing \u00a340million striker Joelinton instead of an ageing player such as Rondon.\n\nBut Bruce, wrongly, believes the whole of Tyneside was against him from the moment he arrived. That is not true. Instead, he and his team are the cause of the criticism to which he takes such offence.\n\nHe called it 'insulting' the insinuation that he sends the team out to play without any instruction. That, incidentally, was never suggested. Rather, the criticism was that his players had failed to carry out whatever instruction he had issued.\n\nAnd given that Bruce has now accepted defeat and ripped up his own approach, he has as good as endorsed the critique.\n\nNewcastle had been defeated 5-0 at Leicester and Bruce accused his players of 'surrender'\n\nWhat you cannot ignore, however, is the danger in Bruce making public his sense of frustration at the paucity of speed and skill at his disposal. What was the motivation, other than protecting himself?\n\nOn the back of him accusing his players of 'surrender' during last Sunday's 5-0 defeat at Leicester, it hardly seemed like the smartest motivational tool, especially as there was an air of condescension to it all.\n\nBruce desperately needs his players on side and, as of last week, there had been no suggestion of him losing the dressing-room. But cracks are beginning to appear and murmurs of unease emerge.\n\nCaptain Jamaal Lascelles spoke candidly immediately after Leicester of a 'terrible' performance, but then took a train to London when Bruce had thought he was going to nearby Nottingham to see family, rather than return to the North-East with the rest of the team.\n\nGoalkeeper Martin Dubravka then claimed Bruce's tactics 'didn't work' and the manager was left with no option but to admit he was right.\n\nCaptain Jamaal Lascelles had spoken immediately after Leicester of a 'terrible' performance\n\nThen there are the mixed messages in public. In one breath Bruce says players can 'no longer hide behind me', but then claims 'the flak stops with me'.\n\nIn the space of five days now he has questioned the squad's commitment and ability. What is left without either of those?\n\nIt would appear that Bruce is clinging to the hope of Benitez's tactics and the remnants of the muscle memory drilled into the players by the Spaniard.\n\nThat, in fairness, is arguably his best option right now. But in making his reasoning public he has shifted this season's shortcomings onto the players. That could yet prove his biggest mistake of all.", "description": "CRAIG HOPE: Steve Bruce is playing a risky game when he suggests his Newcastle players are not capable of matching his own attacking ambitions.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/23/19345418-0-image-a-21_1570315075514.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
