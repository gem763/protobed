Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s two sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, who were born into wealth and work at a company their grandfather founded, have spent the last few weeks contending for the title of World\u2019s Least Self-Aware Person.\n\nFirst, one of them goes on TV or Twitter and attacks Hunter Biden for trading on his father\u2019s name, brushing aside their own histories of doing the same. Then the other one goes on TV or Twitter and wags their finger at Joe Biden allowing his son to profit off his name, never mentioning that their sister and brother-in-law are senior White House officials whose companies are raking in cash as they help craft U.S. policy. With each appearance, the irony and sanctimony are ratcheted up.\n\nThe brotherly competition reached its apex Wednesday night when Don Jr., who became an executive vice-president at his father\u2019s company at the age of 23, appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show and said this: \u201cWhen you\u2019re the father and your son\u2019s entire career is dependent on that, they own you.\u201d\n\nAn actual quote from Don Jr about Hunter Biden: \"When you're the father and your sons entire career is dependent on that, they own you\" pic.twitter.com/KABtg5XzSa \u2014 Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) October 17, 2019\n\nDon Jr. won. He is the World\u2019s Least Self-Aware Person \u2014 a man who shares his name with the president and routinely profits off his father\u2019s position in the White House is criticizing someone else for being \u201cdependent\u201d on his father. Where would Donald Trump Jr. be if his name was not Donald Trump Jr.? Probably not on TV. Not giving $50,000 speeches. And certainly not anywhere close to the White House.", "description": "Donald Trump Jr. criticized Hunter Biden on Fox News, saying: \u201cWhen you\u2019re the father and your son\u2019s entire career is dependent on that, they own you.\u201d Nevermind that he owes his own career and fame entirely to his father.", "authors": ["Adam K.
