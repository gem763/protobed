But you don\u2019t have the Mitt Romneys of the world, they stick together,\u201d he said, referring to the Utah Republican who\u2019s been critical of his Syrian policy in recent days.\n\nMr. Trump argued House Republicans who dogged President Obama at every turn were actually quite dovish, citing the Fast and Furious \u201cgun-walking\u201d scandal and political targeting of conservatives at the IRS during the prior administration.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t impeach them, they never even thought of impeaching him,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nDemocrats have called a steady stream of witnesses in their impeachment inquiry, which focuses on Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nOn the call, Mr. Trump asked for cooperation in investigating a 2020 rival \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden \u2014 and his son, Hunter, and questions around a Democratic National Committee server from 2016.\n\nMr. Trump says dozens of centrists who helped the Democrats retake the House in 2018 will regret pursuing impeachment, which he called a \u201cdirty, disgusting word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think those people want to see this,\u201d he said of vulnerable Democrats. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a big deal \u2026 this was a conversation, it was so perfect.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
