In the final moments of Episode 504, we take a trip with Joanie to the Montauk graveyard, where Cole Lockhart currently resides.\n\nThis is a big piece of information to begin with, but what proves truly seismic is the full shot, which features three gravestones: one for Cole, one for Cole\u2019s father (whose name turns out to be Gabriel Lockhart) \u2026 and one for Scott Lockhart. And they have dates on them. After literally years of frustration over wondering when The Affair takes place, we have answers! Carved in stone and everything!\n\nCole dies in the year 2053 (at the age of 74); meanwhile, Scotty\u2019s death date proves the most illuminating. The mystery surrounding his demise, of course, haunted the first two seasons of The Affair, and thanks to his gravestone we now know that the fateful night of Cole and Luisa\u2019s wedding, when he was killed by a car driven by Helen (after Alison pushed him into the road as he attempted to assault her), took place in 2017.\n\nAnd now, it\u2019s time to do some math: On the day of Scotty\u2019s death (as seen in the season-two finale), Noah says that Joanie is 18 months old. This means that Joanie was born in the year 2016, and presuming that Cole passed away relatively recently, this means that Future Joanie\u2019s storyline takes place in approximately the year 2053 or 2054. This would mean Joanie is about 37 or 38, which matches perfectly with Anna Paquin\u2019s casting (she\u2019s currently 37).\n\nBut more importantly, now that we know what year Joanie was born, we can pinpoint what year the \u201cpresent day\u201d storylines this season are taking place in, because of a comment made by Dr. Vik at the beginning of season five, during a video message to the Solloway family: He came into their lives \u201ceight years ago.\u201d If the events of episode nine in season two are to be trusted, the first time that Helen and Dr. Vik had sex was literally the same night that Joanie was born, meaning that Dr. Vik\u2019s funeral was eight years after 2016 \u2014 meaning that the show\u2019s \u201cpresent day\u201d is set in the year 2024.\n\nSo, in short, if those dates are to be trusted, this show has always been set slightly in the future, and has leaped further and further forward over the seasons. However, this has never really seemed to affect the writing or production in a significant way, which speaks to the way in which the show has always emphasized human relationships above all (or I\u2019m reading way too much into this and/or my math is wrong and/or hey, this is The Affair, there is no such thing as objective truth, right?).\n\nAnyway, other stuff also happened in this episode, like, for example, Whitney getting her own POV section for the first time! The eldest Solloway offspring has been polarizing since the beginning of the series, given how the character (as seen from her parents\u2019 perspective) was the platonic ideal of the bratty teenager, one whose misbehavior led to an abortion, some wild partying, and ill-advised affairs with at least two older men.\n\nAs she got older, her interest in the art world became something of a constant, and her passion for it gets at least some of the focus in her section, as we see her struggle through a tough two days: broke as hell, living with a fianc\u00e9 who spends most of his time hassling her about their upcoming immigration interview, and working for Andrea, a female gallery owner who might be the worst boss in the world.\n\nWhile she\u2019s clearly dissatisfied, when former lover and boss Furkat shows up in her life now, a few years after he hit her in Paris, Whitney is uninterested in reengaging with him. It\u2019s her boss who drags her to his opening at the Broad Museum, where Furkat pleads for her forgiveness, making a scene and kissing her in front of the entire party.\n\nAt the afterparty, Whitney gets high with her new friend, powerful gallery owner Dashiell (Tate Ellington). Confessing that \u201cI don\u2019t want to be looked at anymore \u2014 I want to be the one who does the looking,\u201d she tells him that if she had the money to start her own gallery, she\u2019d have a chance to support artists who have the ability to express something \u201cI don\u2019t have the language for.\u201d\n\nDashiell might be the key to her achieving that dream \u2026 for a price. When Furkat steals her away for some illicit sex in another room, Dashiell joins them because \u201che likes to watch.\u201d Whitney isn\u2019t into the idea of having a voyeur in the room, especially when Dashiell\u2019s hands slip into his pants, but Furkat\u2019s promise that \u201che could give you a gallery\u201d eventually leads her to keep going. When she returns home to Colin, she seems truly wrecked, clinging to her fiance, haunted by the choices she\u2019s made. Whitney may be a flawed character, but this season, Julia Goldani Telles has managed to capture the way in which her lingering adolescent narcissism is fading away to reveal the smart and confident young woman she may potentially become. Whitney is now downright bearable, which is a feat to behold.\n\nMeanwhile, another party that goes badly is Sasha Mann\u2019s Halloween soir\u00e9e, which Noah crashes in his section of the story. (Yeah, we\u2019re basically going in reverse order through the episode this week, what can I say? Time is a flat circle.) Only Helen and the kids are invited (as Helen and Sasha\u2019s relationship is now tabloid official), and Sasha has not only banned Noah from the set of Descent, but is actively seeking a co-writing credit for the film.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t stop Noah (after some encouragement from Margaret) from going to the party in an effort to sabotage Sasha and Helen\u2019s relationship. Rejecting Margaret\u2019s suggestion to plant a wild variety of sex toys in Sasha\u2019s bedroom, he instead decides to plant a pink lace bra under his pillows, directly echoing the moment when he and Helen ended things in season one. \u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole,\u201d Helen tells him when he\u2019s caught, and she says that not even knowing how Noah got the bra: by literally taking it off Erica the script girl after a quick bout of making out, leaving her topless in Sasha\u2019s yard. Poor, poor Erica, learning one of the world\u2019s most important lessons \u2014 never trust Noah Solloway with anything you value. Especially your dignity.\n\nThere Is No Objective Truth (Just Bullet Points)\n\n\u2022 Margaret\u2019s plan to plant sex toys in Sasha\u2019s room to encourage Helen to break up with him is ridiculous, but Noah throwing them away just feels wasteful. Sex toys aren\u2019t cheap, Noah! At least see if the Pleasure Chest has a return policy!\n\n\u2022 Speaking of throwing things away, the only other major development from Joanie\u2019s storyline is her fixing the solar cells on the roof of the old Lockhart house, and then pretty much throwing away any evidence of the human beings who once lived in that house, including framed photos and baby Gabriel\u2019s toy chest. The show is slowly unpacking Joanie\u2019s trauma for us, and her lack of sentimentality feels like a key puzzle piece.\n\n\u2022 Today in \u201cwhy does that person look familiar?\u201d: Megan Duffy, who plays Erica, had a brief but memorable role during the first season of Mad Men, playing the \u201cPoetry Girl\u201d who takes off her sweater after a cabaret performance in the East Village, in which she cooed, \u201cLast night, I dreamed of making love to Fidel Castro, in a king-sized bed at the Waldorf Astoria.\u201d\n\n\u2022 For those who might be craving a touch of Noah Comeuppance, the mockup for the poster of \u201cSasha Mann\u2019s Descent\u201d goes a long way.\n\n\u2022 Again, cannot say enough how happy it makes me to have actual dates now, especially since knowing the approximate years plays heavily into all of the futuristic details we see in Joanie\u2019s sections.\n\n\u2022 Whether or not these dates were the result of after-the-fact retconning, so far they hold up halfway decently \u2014 but it\u2019s not flawless. For example, Helen notes that Whitney is 24 years old in the \u201cpresent day,\u201d which means she was born around 2000, and was thus a teenager in 2016-2017. But in season one, it\u2019s said she\u2019s 17 the fall when she gets the abortion \u2014 which would theoretically be a while before the birth of Joanie and other subsequent events \u2026 Maybe I take it back. Maybe things were better before.", "description": "For the first time, Whitney gets her own POV storyline, and it\u2019s crushing.
