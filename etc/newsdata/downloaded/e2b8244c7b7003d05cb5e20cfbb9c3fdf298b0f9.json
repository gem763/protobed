According to Newzoo, the global games market is expected to grow from $137.9 billion in 2018 to $180.1 billion in 2021.\n\nWith that in mind, investors are looking to capitalize on opportunities within this constantly evolving space. When looking for the most compelling investments in this industry, analysts tell investors that 3 gaming stocks look especially poised to outperform.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at these 3 fast-growing gaming stocks.\n\nGlu Mobile (GLUU)\n\nGlu Mobile develops and publishes mobile games specifically for smartphones and tablets. Given the fact that shares are down 45% year-to-date, some analysts argue this gaming stock is undervalued.\n\nThe company\u2019s second quarter earnings results seem to support this argument. On August 1, GLUU reported that it generated $101.9 million worth of bookings, the largest in its history. It also saw its sixth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA profitability as well as launched two new games including WWE Universe and Diner Dash Adventures.\n\nAdding to the good news, GLUU has made significant efforts to expand its user base to include female gamers who are typically underrepresented. It released the Design Home and the Kendall and Kylie game back in 2016, with the company stating that several more games for this target audience are in development.\n\nOne analyst points out that GLUU\u2019s strategy of focusing more on games they fully own rather than celebrity licensed properties will pay off in the long-term.\n\n\u201cWe believe there are multiple potential positive catalysts for the stock in 2020,\u201d Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter stated. As a result, he reiterated his Buy rating and lowered the price target from $9 to $8 on August 2. The three-star analyst notes that the current share price of $4.44 presents a buying opportunity as he sees 80% upside potential for the stock.\n\nAll in all, the rest of the Street remains bullish on GLUU. It boasts a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 analyst consensus and a $9 average price target, suggesting 92% upside potential.\n\nSciPlay Corporation (SCPL)\n\nThe next gaming stock on our list has also had a bit of a rough going since its May 3 IPO. That being said, the online casino game company still offers investors plenty of upside potential.\n\nSome analysts are picking SciPlay based on the results from its latest quarter. The company announced on August 1 that Q2 revenue reached $118.1 million, up 18% year-over-year which was more than double the market growth rate according to estimates from Eilers and Krejcik. It doesn't hurt that profits and cash flow also gained year-over-year.\n\nManagement attributes this growth to its strong product offerings. Its largest game in terms of revenue, Jackpot Party, performed well with over 28% year-over-year growth. Adding to the good news, three of SCPL\u2019s games are ranked in the top 30 in the Social Casino Category on Apple's App Store, and six games are ranked in the top 30 on Google Play for Top Grossing Casino Games.\n\nThe company has also placed a substantial focus on analytics in an attempt to drive margin improvement.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It\u2019s no question that the gaming industry is taking off.
