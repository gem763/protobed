The once-sprawling company will instead focus just on power plants (pictured above), jet engines and windmills, plus related equipment and services\n\nPension plans are among the company's biggest liabilities and were underfunded by about $27 billion at the end of 2018. U.S. employees facing the pension freeze will be moved to a defined-contribution retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, in 2021.\n\nThe company has struggled to boost profits amid a slump in demand for its gas-fired turbines for power generation. It also faces potential costs of more than $1 billion in its jet engine unit from the grounding of Boeing Co's 737 MAX airliner.\n\nGeneral Electric, now known as GE, also is likely to set aside about $11 billion to cover liabilities for its long-term care insurance business.\n\nBy freezing the US pensions, pre-paying about $4.5 billion in contributions due in 2021 and 2022 and offering lump sums to about 100,000 retirees, GE said it expects to cut pension underfunding by $5 billion to $8 billion.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said there was no immediate net reduction in GE's pension liabilities given the 90 basis-point decline in long-term interest rates since the end of last year, which has caused its pension liabilities to creep up to about $34 billion from $27 billion toward the end of 2018.\n\n'The impact is being offset now, rather being reduced. So it is possible that investors are not cheering,' Heymann told Reuters. He added, though, that Culp 'is setting up (GE for) much better performance next year.'\n\nGE's windmill business is among the core businesses that the struggling conglomerate will hold on to.

The company had about 283,000 employees at the end of 2018, about 97,000 of them in the United States.\n\nGE expects to record a non-cash pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter, but did not specify the amount.\n\nThe company also said it would pre-fund about $4 billion to $5 billion of its requirements for 2021 and 2022 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by using a portion of the $38 billion in cash it is collecting from the sale of various businesses.\n\nGE said it was on track to hit its target of less than 2.5 times net-debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, by the end of 2020.", "description": "GE will freeze 20,000 US pensions to cut $6 to $8 billion in retirement underfunding, hoping to offset a rise in its pension obligations due to lower interest rates, under CEO Larry Culp.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
