Lighter blue colours show areas that are thinner\n\nA fatty diet may cause damaging inflammation at a time when a child's brain is still developing.\n\nBut another theory is that children had different brains before they became obese, which made fatty and sugary foods more rewarding and reduced their willpower, while also affecting their thinking abilities.\n\nThe study, led by the University of Cambridge, involved US children asked to do tests including remembering a list of animals in size order and spotting matching patterns.\n\nLean children scored almost six points higher than obese children, and almost four points higher than those who were overweight on average.\n\nThe tests are designed to measure 'executive function', which includes short-term memory and decision-making.\n\nHOW FAT ARE BRITISH CHILDREN? England's 10 and 11 year olds are fatter than ever, according to NHS figures published earlier this month that laid bare the nation's obesity crisis. A third of children in Year Six are now overweight, and almost a quarter \u2013 around 150,000 youngsters \u2013 are deemed obese or severely obese. Children in poor areas such as Wolverhampton are four times more likely to be obese than those residing in Richmond or other affluent places. The head of the NHS said the shock statistics showed the Government was 'not on track' to halve childhood obesity rates by 2030. It came after the nation's chief medical officer recommended a host of radical plans to tackle the growing obesity crisis, including a ban on eating on public transport.\n\nDr Lisa Ronan, first author of the study from Cambridge's department of psychiatry, said: 'The study shows reduced executive function in obese and overweight children, which might suggest they would struggle with planning, problem-solving and regulating emotions.\n\n'That could affect their performance at school, but not every child who is overweight will have these brain changes and test results, so the results cannot tell us much about the real world.\n\n'It may be the case that the changes in brain structure come before obesity, or that shared genes cause both.'\n\nAlmost one in five children in the UK are overweight or obese when they start primary school, putting them at greater risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer in later life.\n\nThe latest study is one of the largest to look at children's BMI (body mass index) and their thinking skills and brains.\n\nResearchers found heavier children did worse on tests of executive function, even when factors like their age and economic circumstances were taken into account.\n\nLooking at MRI scans of the children's entire brains, they found those who were most overweight had a thinner cortex - the 'grey matter' which makes up the outer layer of the brain.\n\nThe results, published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, found that a thinner cortex, particularly the pre-frontal cortex at the front of the brain, meant worse test results, and vice versa.\n\nThe findings raise concern for obese children, as problems with thinking skills in childhood tend to continue through to adulthood.\n\nIf being overweight causes brain changes, that might explain why obese adults who have weight loss surgery develop better cognitive abilities.\n\nHowever children with poor thinking skills may also have had them before they put on weight.\n\nThat is because executive function affects not only working memory but also the brain's reward pathway, which might make food more desirable, and children's impulsiveness, which might cause them to overeat.\n\nThe study will follow the children over time to see if losing weight improves their test results.\n\nProfessor Paul Fletcher, senior author of the study from the University of Cambridge, said: 'The findings contribute a small part towards our growing understanding of the causes and consequences of obesity in children.'", "description": "The study, led by the University of Cambridge, involved asking 2,700 children to do tests including remembering a list of animals in size order and spotting matching patterns.", "authors": ["Victoria Allen Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20083550-0-image-a-35_1571835642545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
