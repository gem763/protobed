(Skype)\n\nBe creative\n\n\u201cCreativity fuels the app,\u201d said 23-year-old Samantha Caleon, one half of the Caleon Twins from Toronto.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re creating short clips that are 15 seconds long, so you need to come up with content that fits into that short amount of time that\u2019s entertaining,\u201d said Madeleine, the other half of the sister duo, who together have over 3.3 million followers.\n\nBe yourself\n\n\u201cBe who you are,\u201d said Maxime Beaulieu from North Bay, Ont.\n\nWith 1.6 million followers, the 17-year-old with Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS) said the secret to his success is being real.\n\n\u201cThe way I was born, I have missing bones in my face, and that made me become who I am on TikTok,\u201c he said.\n\nFor Maxime, a good sense of humour is also key.\n\n\u201cI made fun of myself and my jawline in a video and it went viral,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTikTok has made me more confident in myself to know that people respect me for the way that I look.\u201d\n\nFollow trends\n\nAnother trick is to jump on trends from TikTok\u2019s For You page.\n\nJade Taylor-Ryan, 17, who had just been on the app for a month when she went viral, did just that.\n\nWithin 24 hours of posting a TikTok featuring her pet cat, Ed, Jade\u2019s video logged more than 6.8 million views and 1.2 million likes.\n\n\u201cI saw another user use the nine-person filter and the Mr. Sandman song combined and then it literally just popped into my head to use my cat,\u201d Jade said.\n\n\u201cWhen following trends, try to add a little twist to your videos so they are unique,\u201d she added.\n\nNow that Ed is a star, Jade is considering also making her pet dog, Sam, a TikTok star.\n\n\u201cLearning from this video, people seem to really like animals, so I would say another tip is to use your pets.\u201d\n\nLive stream with fans\n\n\u201cLive streaming creates a sense of community and a support system with our fans. In return, they're more engaged with our content,\u201d said the Caleon Twins.\n\nMatthew Scarfone, who also live streams to increase his fanbase, said it\u2019s a good way to generate an income on the app.\n\n\u201cFans send you gifts, which is great, but you do split half the amount with the platform,\u201d said the 18-year-old from Toronto, who has 1.2 million followers.\n\nCollabs/duets\n\nMatthew has gone viral many times with collaborations he made with his friend Malachi.\n\nHe said creating a series of videos allows you to build up hype.\n\n\u201cWe were at Walmart one day and decided to record a TikTok of us in front of a poster featuring two kids that kind of looked like us,\u201d Matthew said.\n\n\u201cWe post them on both our pages and we keep gaining a lot of fans that way. It\u2019s like our go-to video if we are losing followers. We just post one of those videos and it goes viral,\u201d he said.\n\nMatthew and Malachi\u2019s series of Walmart videos attracted more than 4.7 million views.\n\nAnother trend popular on TikTok is duets, where you react to other people\u2019s videos on a split screen.\n\n\u201cThis one girl put her hand on mine while I was going up an escalator and I turned around confused,\u201d said 15-year-old Luca Schaefer-Charlton from Vancouver, B.C, who has 1.4 million followers.\n\nSomeone filmed the interaction.\n\n\u201cAfter I found the video on the trending page, I edited a duet with it. It went viral with seven million views.\u201d\n\nFrequency\n\n\u201cWhat I did to start off was I posted at a regular time on a daily basis, so everybody would know to come back at that specific time,\u201d Luca said.\n\n\u201cFrequency is really important. We plan our videos in advance and we have set dates during the week for filming, editing and posting,\u201d said the Caleon Twins.\n\nFind your niche\n\n18-year-old Jayde Vincent from Calgary, who recently hit over one million followers, emphasized that following what you love is key.\n\n\u201cIf you're passionate about something and you\u2019re talented with it, show it. For me, it\u2019s dancing,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of Jayde\u2019s TikToks show her performing unique dance moves that fans can even learn from.\n\nJayde Vincent\u2019s passion for dancing led her to attract more than one million followers on TIkTok. (Skype)\n\nCreate suspense\n\n\u201cPeople want to be surprised,\u201d said Gregory Galant, CEO and co-founder of the Shorty Awards.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t focus on getting famous or going viral. Focus on making great content and connecting with the audience.\u201d\n\nBe careful what you do online\n\nYou must be 13 or older to register for TikTok, and like most social media platforms, it comes with a bunch of serious privacy and safety concerns.\n\nBecause the accounts are automatically set to public, this means strangers have access to kids\u2019 profiles and can easily message you.\n\nDon\u2019t share any personal information with people you don\u2019t know.\n\nAnd like YouTube, the content becomes public property, so remember that your TikTok videos can be widely shared without your knowledge or permission.\n\nThe app also has other drawbacks.\n\n\u201cTo be a star on TikTok [is] awesome, but in school, people will take advantage of you or pick on you. You just have to hang out with the right people,\u201d said Matthew.\n\nThe rewards\n\nOverall, it\u2019s been a rewarding experience for Maxime. He met Matthew through the app when they decided to collaborate.\n\n\u201cTikTok has helped me connect with people and make new friends like Matthew.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get messages from people that struggle with depression on a daily basis saying, 'You helped me.' As long as I\u2019m making one person smile a day, I feel like I\u2019m making a difference,\u201d Luca said.", "description": "Tips from some of Canada\u2019s top TikTokers on how to become a TikTok star.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/TikTok_thumbnail_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
