The State Department previously blocked him from testifying, spurring the committees to issue a subpoena to compel his testimony.\n\nAccording to his prepared opening statement, Sondland said he and other diplomats were \"disappointed\" that President Trump directed them to work with Giuliani shortly after the election of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"Please know that I would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters,\" Sondland said in his statement. \"However, given the President's explicit direction, as well as the importance we attached to arranging a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, we agreed to do as President Trump directed.\"\n\nSondland also said he was unaware of Giuliani was targeting former Vice President Joe Biden by urging Ukrainian officials to open an investigation in Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that appointed Biden's son Hunter to its board of directors in 2014.\n\nRead his prepared statement here:\n\nThe president's directive\n\nSondland said described a meeting at the White House on May 23, shortly after Zelensky was inaugurated president. He said he asked the White House to arrange a congratulatory call between the two leaders.\n\n\"However, President Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr. Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns,\" Sondland said. \"It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the President's mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani. It is my understanding that Energy Secretary [Rick] Perry and Special Envoy Volker took the lead on reaching out to Mr. Giuliani, as the President had directed.\"\n\nSondland said he thought career diplomats at the State Department should take the lead in crafting U.S. policy toward Ukraine, not the president's personal lawyer. But he said Mr. Trump gave him and others little choice but to work with Giuliani.\n\n\"[B]ased on the President's direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President's concerns,\" he said.\n\nThe ambassador said he was unaware that Giuliani intended to dig up dirt on the Bidens to help the president's reelection campaign, despite Giuliani's numerous public statements laying out his strategy.\n\n\"I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani's agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President's 2020 reelection campaign,\" Sondland said.\n\nThe July 25 phone call\n\nSondland said he was \"pleased to hear\" that Mr. Trump and Zelensky spoke on July 25, in a now-infamous phone call at the center of a whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry. In that call, Mr. Trump urged Zelensky to work with Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate supposed interference by Ukrainians in the 2016 U.S. elections, as well as Burisma, the gas company that had employed Hunter Biden.\n\nSondland said he was not on the call and had not seen the official summary of the conversation until the administration released it publicly under immense public pressure on September 25.\n\n\"None of the brief and general call summaries I received contained any mention of Burisma or former Vice President Biden, nor even suggested that President Trump had made any kind of request of President Zelensky,\" Sondland said. \"I had heard afterwards that the July 25, 2019 call went well in solidifying a relationship between the two leaders.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.
