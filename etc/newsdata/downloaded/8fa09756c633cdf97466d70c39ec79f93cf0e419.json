One person at TikTok told CNBC that the company offers salaries up to 20% higher than Facebook's to draw experienced employees from its competitors. TikTok has also reportedly hired employees from Apple, Google, Hulu, Snap, and other tech companies during this high-growth period.\n\nAlthough Facebook hasn't officially listed TikTok as a competitor in financial documents, the company seems to be aware of the growing threat from the short-form video app. In November 2018, Facebook launched Lasso, a standalone video app that was nearly identical to TikTok. Lasso didn't take off; Sensor Tower estimates it's been downloaded 420,000 outside of China, compared to TikTok's more than 500 million users.\n\nFacebook's Instagram also appears to be working on a TikTok competitor. Discovered by reverse app engineer Jane Manchum Wong, the tool will be called \"Clips,\" and it will allow users to combine short videos and add music, mimicking TikTok.\n\nWhile the number of TikTok's daily users are nowhere near Facebook's, the app's parent company ByteDance is growing quickly. ByteDance has been described as \"China's Facebook,\" and it is the highest valued private company in the world at $75 billion. ByteDance launched the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin, in 2016, and the international version under the name TikTok a year later. In late 2017, the company purchased another video sharing app, Musical.ly, and combined them in August 2018. By September 2019, TikTok was the top free non-gaming app in the US.\n\nIn leaked audio published by The Verge, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the company's plans to compete with TikTok, \"So yeah. I mean, TikTok is doing well...we're trying to first see if we can get it to work in countries where TikTok is not already big before we go and compete with TikTok in countries where they are big.\"", "description": "TikTok is further encroaching on Facebook territory by moving into the former Facebook-owned WhatsApp office in Mountain View, California.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5cd0ecc4a0a31a452be0d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
