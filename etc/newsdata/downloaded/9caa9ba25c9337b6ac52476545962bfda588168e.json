A spokesman for Schiff has also said that the committee didn't review the whistleblower complaint in advance, and that Schiff knew neither the details of the complaint nor the whistleblower's identity.\n\nThe Democratic chairman has become a central figure in Republican attacks as they look to push back on Democrats impeachment efforts.\n\nThe resolution comes as Democrats continue to move full steam ahead on their probe, which is overseen by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees.\n\nAmbassador William Taylor, currently the top diplomat in Ukraine, is set to testify on Tuesday. Taylor was involved in a text message exchange with two other U.S. diplomats that was made public after on testified.\n\nPhilip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of European and Eurasian affairs at the State Department and Michael Duffey, the associate director for national security programs within the Office of Management and Budget, are set to meet with lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, deputy assistant secretary of Defense Laura Cooper and Lt.

While, Matthew Palmer, a deputy assistant secretary, will testify before both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nThe hearings come after Vice President Pence announced that the United States and Turkey had agreed to a 120-hour ceasefire agreement, during which the administration would not apply additional sanctions against Ankara for its invasion of northern Syria.\n\nIf the ceasefire holds and becomes permanent, the Trump administration would also drop sanctions announced earlier this month.\n\nLawmakers are currently weighing potential legislation to respond to Turkey\u2019s military incursion.\n\nThe House passed a resolution last week that formally opposed Trump\u2019s strategy.

Elijah Cummings, 68, the former chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform is slated to lie in state in Statuary Hall on Thursday.\n\nCummings \u2014 the son of a sharecropper who climbed to being one of the most influential Democratic voices in Congress, having played a leading role in the impeachment inquiry \u2014 died on Thursday due to complications with long standing health challenges.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat has been lauded by members from both parties praised him for championing civil rights and having made a legislative impact on key issues.\n\n\u201cHe taught his colleagues how to persevere in the face of adversity, laboring through health challenges in recent years out of a love for serving his constituents and country,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton HoyerHouse Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment Scalise, Cole introduce resolution to change rules on impeachment Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg defends handling of misinformation in political ads | Biden camp hits Zuckerberg over remarks | Dem bill would jail tech execs for lying about privacy | Consumer safety agency accidentally disclosed personal data MORE (D-Md.) said in a statement following his death.\n\n\u201cHe taught us patience and fortitude when confronted with malice from opponents, which he answered with \u2018charity for all.\u201d\n\nVotes were cancelled and memorial service for Cummings family and their guests is expected to be held in the Capitol that morning followed by a viewing for the public, Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiTurkey sanctions face possible wall in GOP Senate Trump lashes out at Pelosi as she visits Jordan to discuss Syria Thomas D'Alesandro III, brother of Nancy Pelosi, dies at 90 MORE (D-Calif.) announced on Friday.\n\nMembers on both sides of the aisle are expected to attend a funeral service is scheduled to be held at 10 a.m. Friday, Oct. 25, at the New Psalmist Baptist Church, which is located in Baltimore, a city he represented.\n\nElection interference\n\nThe House is slated to take up a bill aimed at clamping down on foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\nThe Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy Act (SHIELD) \u2014 spearheaded by Rep.

The bill would also place restrictions on exchanging campaign information getween campaigns and foreign governments.\n\n\u201cMost Americans know that foreign governments have no business interfering in our elections. Instead, the Trump campaign and White House have welcomed and repeatedly solicited foreign assistance for his political activities. This behavior is unacceptable, and it is telling that the White House has gone to great lengths to hide it from the American people,\u201d ,\u201d Lofgren said in a statement upon its introduction.\n\n\u201cThe SHIELD Act will protect our elections from foreign interference by closing loopholes that allow dishonest behavior, increasing disclosure and transparency requirements, and ensuring that individuals engaging in conduct with foreign actors intending to influence the outcome of our elections will be held accountable by law.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat-lead bill faces an uphill battle in the upper chamber.\n\nGovernment funding\n\nMcConnell is turning the Senate toward trying to fund the government as the appropriations process has largely stalled in the Senate.\n\nThe GOP leader announced late last week that the Senate would try to take up two spending packages\u2014the first focused on domestic spending, while the second would include a mammoth defense bill. In an effort to entice Democrats into moving the funding bills, the Senate will first try to tackle the domestic spending bill, considered a priority for Democrats.\n\n\"In order to meet Democrats halfway, the first House shell we will vote on will be a package of the domestic funding bills. If we can get bipartisan support to take up that domestic funding bill, we will stay on it until we complete it,\" McConnell said.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbySenate GOP braces for impeachment trial 'roller coaster' McConnell tees up government funding votes amid stalemate GOP warns Graham letter to Pelosi on impeachment could 'backfire' MORE (R-Ala.) and Sen.

Asked if they would provide the votes this week, Leahy note it would depend on which funding bills were included.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to work out something,\u201d Leahy said late last week.\n\nThe government is funded through Nov. 21. To avoid a shutdown after that lawmakers either need to pass the 12 fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills or another stopgap continuing resolution (CR).\n\nThe Senate has passed none of its 2020 bills, while the House has passed 10. They\u2019ll need to reconcile their bills, before a compromise can be sent to Trump.\n\nTreaties\n\nThe Senate will vote this week on a treaty ratifying Macedonia\u2019s membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s vote comes after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoGOP lawmaker: Trump administration 'playing checkers' in Syria while others are 'playing chess' Trump-Graham relationship tested by week of public sparring White House officials work to tamp down controversies after a tumultuous week MORE said earlier this month that he was \u201cconfident\u201d that Senate would formally sign off on the country\u2019s membership in the international organization.\n\n\u201cI am confident that the United States Senate will ratify your accession protocol this fall so that we can formally fold you in to the NATO team,\u201d Pompeo said during a visit to the country.\n\nIn addition to the treaty vote, McConnell also teed up a vote on Andrew Bremberg\u2019s nomination ambassador the Office of the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva.", "description": "Tensions are set to escalate this week over the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry as Republicans try to formally rebuke Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calf.).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/schiffadam_pelosinancy_100219gn7_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
