He has spent his entire career at Nissan, and graduated from Japan's National Defense Academy, usually a track into the military.\n\nNissan has been undergoing a governance overhaul in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, which saw the tycoon accused of under-reporting compensation and using company funds for personal expenses.\n\nThe decision to name a new COO and vice-COO is intended to create a more open executive structure, experts said.\n\n\"The troika system was introduced to avoid the emergence of dictatorship,\" said Koji Endo, a senior analyst at SBI Securities.\n\nBut he warned that the decision could come with downsides.\n\n\"The troika management system may have some weakness when it comes to quick decision-making compared with a system led by a strong leader.\"\n\nAnd the team faces enormous challenges. In July the firm posted its worst first-quarter results since the global financial crisis and, while it has cited a global slowdown in the auto sector, Nissan is also suffering from a lack of innovation and reputational damage from the Ghosn scandal.\n\n\"The very first thing the new CEO has to do is to revise down Nisan's full-year earnings forecast... and then cut dividends,\" Endo said.\n\nThe alliance must also be strengthened, 12,500 job cuts implemented, and the U.S. business turned around, he added.\n\n\"It is a task that normally takes more than a year or two but it has to be fixed quickly.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Nissan's new chief executive Makoto Uchida is an insider with a global outlook, but he faces an uphill struggle to right the Japanese automaker still reeling from the Carlos Ghosn scandal.
