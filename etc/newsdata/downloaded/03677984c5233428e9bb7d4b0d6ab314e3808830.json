The only glitch came when she fell on her opening quadruple Salchow.\n\n\"Overall I am pleased with my performance, I am only upset that I missed the Salchow,\" Trusova told reporters. \"It happens in practice quite often that I miss the first jump, but I just pull myself together and carry on.\"\n\nTrusova had been only third after Friday's short program but dominated Saturday's competition.\n\nJapan's Rika Kihira, the short program leader, finished second with 230.33 points and South Korean You Young joined them on the podium with 217.49 points.\n\nBoth Kihira and You fell on triple axel attempts.\n\nPiper Gilles and Paul Poirier gave Canadians their own reason to cheer when they overcame two-time world medalists Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue of the United States to win the ice dance competition.\n\nGilles and Poirier, second after Friday's rhythm dance, surged to the top in Saturday's free dance to claim their first International Skating Union Grand Prix gold medal with 209.01 points.\n\nHubbell and Donohue took second (206.31) with Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson third (195.35).\n\nIn pairs, Russians took gold and bronze.\n\nAleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovskii won with 216.71 points with compatriots Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov earning third (202.29)\n\nThe silver went to Canadians Kirsten Moore-Towers and Michael Marinaro (208.49).
