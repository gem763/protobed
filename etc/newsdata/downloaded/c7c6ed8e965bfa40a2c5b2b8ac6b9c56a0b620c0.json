Whatever his faults, he stands up for U.S. citizens.\n\nI believe the response of the British Government has been pathetic.\n\nSix weeks have passed since the fatal accident and more than a month since the U.S. defied requests to waive diplomatic immunity. The best that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has managed has been to phone U.S. ambassador Woody Johnson to 'express disappointment'.\n\nIt is the prime duty of our elected representatives to stand up for our citizens and for the rule of law.\n\nBoris Johnson has said of this current disagreement with the U.S.: 'If we can't resolve it, then, of course, I will be raising it myself personally with the White House.'\n\nThis is the least he should do. A British citizen is dead, the suspect the wife of a U.S. diplomat who was then hurried out of the country.\n\nIf this is how our closest ally maltreats us, it sends the message to every other country in the world that Britain can be treated with disrespect.\n\nThe steps that Mr Johnson needs to take are very clear.\n\nHe must speak directly to Trump \u2014 a man who has described him as 'a very good guy, a very talented person' \u2014 and explain in the strongest terms that the lives of British citizens count.\n\nHe must stress that the American allegedly responsible for the death of a teenage motorcyclist in Northamptonshire should not be above the law.\n\nRaab's weak response gives the impression that Britain is the 51st state of America and kowtows to every decision from Washington. The Foreign Secretary should have summoned ambassador Johnson, the billionaire heir to the Johnson & Johnson consumer products fortune, to Whitehall and given him what is known in military circles as an interview without coffee.\n\nDominic Raab has built his career by fighting against what he believes to be the threat posed to British sovereignty from the European Union.\n\nBut what about our rule of law and not being countermanded by foreigners, in this case by Americans?\n\nFor all the agony of Harry Dunn's mother \u2014 she says the family are 'utterly broken' \u2014 I accept there are rare occasions when it is right for diplomatic immunity to be maintained. But this is not one.\n\nOf course, certain cases involve national security.\n\nThere are many countries which cannot be trusted to give the accused a fair trial, perhaps especially if they are an American citizen.\n\nBut that isn't the case with the British justice system.\n\nWe are a country which respects the rule of law. Our judicial system is utterly impartial and immune to government pressure, as seen with the recent ruling by the Supreme Court that Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful.\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, was killed in road crash near RAF base Northamptonshire where Anne Sacoolas's husband is said to have worked\n\nThe Americans must know that Mrs Sacoolas would get a fair trial in Britain.\n\nThe maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years and most people found guilty serve much less.\n\nThe very least the family of Harry Dunn deserves is to see the person responsible for his death face justice. I wonder how Woody Johnson would like it if one of his children had been killed in an accident in the U.S. and the suspect then claimed diplomatic immunity from prosecution and quickly left the country.\n\nTo be fair to our politicians, it has long been the bad habit of British foreign policy to pander to Washington and not challenge the U.S. government.\n\nTony Blair's decision to wage an illegal war in Iraq, which cost the lives of 179 British soldiers as well as countless Iraqis, was partly due to his desire to suck up to the U.S..\n\nBut not all British leaders have grovelled in this way.\n\nMargaret Thatcher's relationship with Ronald Reagan was always based on respect rather than subservience.\n\nFor example, she rebuked him after the U.S. invaded Grenada, a Commonwealth country, without consulting her first.\n\nHave we also not learnt anything from the shocking murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher on a London street?\n\nThe policewoman was shot by a gunman at Libya's London embassy 35 years ago but her killer was among 21 Libyan diplomats allowed to return home under the protection of diplomatic immunity.\n\nNo wonder cynics have described diplomatic immunity as being a 'get out of jail free card' \u2014 allowing foreign offenders to escape prosecution for a range of offences.\n\nAnne Sacoolas must return forthwith to Britain where she can be questioned and, if need be, charged with a criminal offence.\n\nIf she does faces trial, it would be under the impartial British justice system.\n\nWe should heed the wisdom of Rosalyn Higgins, who held what's considered to be the most prestigious legal position in the world, presidency of the International Court of Justice.\n\nShe has said diplomatic immunity 'allows diplomats to be able to carry out their functions within the framework of necessary security and confidentiality' but it 'does not entitle diplomats to flout local laws'.\n\nHarry Dunn's grieving family deserve that this dictum is honoured.", "description": "PETER OBORNE: Killing another human being, even by mistake, is a terrible act.
