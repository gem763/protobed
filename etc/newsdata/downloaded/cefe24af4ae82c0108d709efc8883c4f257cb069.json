And those friends have older siblings or YouTube and are often all-too-happy to introduce them to the horror villains of our childhood \u2014 Freddy Kruger, Pennywise, Michael Meyers, Jason Voorhees. Remember how creepy Gremlins were??\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened when Reddit user u/atavix sent her eight-year-old daughter to a friend\u2019s house recently for a playdate. Rather than enjoying a couple of hours of old-fashioned fort-building fun, her little girl met Chucky for the first time:\n\nShe was extremely clingy, and it was clear something was bothering her. When I asked her in the car, she told me that her friend had shown her videos of Chucky, and she was terrified. It was difficult to know for sure, but my understanding is that it was about 15 minutes of two or three YouTube clips that had Chucky in them.\n\nAfter several days of living in fear both at home and at school, u/atavix asked for advice and received a suggestion from u/DallySleep that got a solid Reddit community endorsement: Lift the horror-movie veil.\n\nMaybe find some suitable \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 videos of Chucky \u2014 how they painted him, how they got him to move, interviews with the actors, etc. It might help her to take some of the magic away when seen how it is all put together. The wider shots showing all the cameras and sets, etc., may also help her see how unreal it all is.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for little kids to understand how something that looks so real and so scary is just a bunch of people playing pretend. It doesn\u2019t look pretend, it doesn\u2019t sound pretend, and the images are too intense to simply take your word on it. But you can show them how it\u2019s pretend. Here are some other ways to do that:\n\nFind old episodes or clips of Face Off, a competition/elimination series featuring special effects make-up artists. Here\u2019s an example that shows how monsters and ghouls are made from silicone, spray paint and other materials \u2014 and you see the artists interacting with the models and taking their comfort into consideration.\n\nShow your kid how stop animation works to demystify animated characters. This behind-the-scenes look at how Kubo and the Two Strings was made is incredible (as a bonus, it shows how much patience and meticulous work goes into creating shows our kids love).\n\nIf your kids want to watch something you think they\u2019re probably ready for but might scare them a bit, you could do all of this preemptively. But when you\u2019re caught off-guard by sudden evil-clown-phobia, do damage control by searching for behind-the-scenes shots and interviews with the actors who play the characters that creeped them out.\n\nFair warning: Many Redditors who commented in favour of showing kids how horror works were scared by it themselves as kids. After a peek behind the scenes, they then fell in love with horror, even attempting to or dreaming of creating their own horror films. But, hey, that\u2019s better than remaining terrified that Chucky is around every corner \u2014 as long as they know not to share their newfound love of horror with their other little buddies.", "description": "Despite our best efforts to not scare the crap out of our kids at an early age, our kids have friends.
