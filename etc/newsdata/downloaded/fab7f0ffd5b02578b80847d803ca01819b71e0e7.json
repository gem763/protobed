It's natural to charge fees for providing services such as maintaining bank accounts,\" an official at the Financial Service Agency (FSA) said.\n\nWhile the additional revenue is attractive, many banks are cautious of charging fees for fear of angering depositors and prodding them to flee to their rivals - or shift to cash, the sources say.\n\n\"Depositors are accustomed to holding bank accounts free of charge,\" an official at a regional bank said. \"Just announcing plans of a fee would face heavy resistance.\"\n\nThe debate could affect the BOJ's decision on how quickly to ease and whether to deepen negative rates if it were to act.\n\nThe BOJ has signaled its readiness to ramp up stimulus to fend off shocks to the economy. But it has also stressed it would be mindful of any side-effects such an action could have, including the impact on financial institutions.\n\nCommercial banks in Japan, unlike those in many countries, do not charge maintenance fees for bank accounts and have flatly denied the possibility of applying negative rates to deposits.\n\nGiven strong public resistance to being charged bank fees, the topic is politically sensitive, particularly after household were hit by a increase in a sales tax hike this month.\n\n\"We may have no choice but to do so if the BOJ deepens negative rates,\" an official at another regional bank said.\n\nUnder a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and long-term rates around 0%.", "description": "BOJ's policy prod banks to charge fees, may affect negative rate debate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF970JV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
