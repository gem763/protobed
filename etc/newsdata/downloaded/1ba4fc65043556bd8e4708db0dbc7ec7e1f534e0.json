Keselowski got bottled up on the final restart and fell three positions in the final two laps, effectively going from being in the next round points-wise to being eliminated when he crossed the finish line.\n\n\u201cI got sandwiched \u2026 and just all bad, didn\u2019t do a good enough job,\u201d Keselowski said. \u201cIt is what it is. I don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s (championship hopes) all over now.\u201d\n\nChase Elliott finished second, earning enough points to pass Keselowski and move on to the Round of 8.\n\n\u201cWe had to stay fighting in these things, especially these late-race restarts,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cYou have to fight. \u2026 If you want to get to Homestead, that\u2019s what you have to do. We\u2019re excited to move on.\u201d\n\nKyle Busch finished third, Kurt Busch was fourth and Byron finished fifth.\n\nClick here for the results.\n\nPOINTS:\n\nEight drivers move on to the Round of 8, from which four drivers will emerge after the race at Phoenix and advance to race for the championship at Homestead-Miami Speedway a month from now.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose eight drivers (and their unofficial reseeded points) are: Kyle Busch (4,046 points), Martin Truex Jr. (4,042), Denny Hamlin (4,037), Joey Logano (4,030), Kevin Harvick (4,028), Chase Elliott (4,024), Kyle Larson (4,011) and Ryan Blaney (4,009.\n\nClick here for the reseeded standings.\n\nFollow @JerryBonkowski", "description": "Here are the results and standings after Sunday's elimination race.
