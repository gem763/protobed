However, the XRP/USD pair failed to gain strength above $0.2550 and recently declined. It broke the $0.2500 and $0.2480 support levels. Moreover, there was a close below the $0.2500 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nDuring the decline, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support near $0.2475 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair tested the $0.2420 support area and it is currently correcting higher. It broke the $0.2450 level, plus the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2544 high to $0.2415 low. However, the previous support near the $0.2500 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average are currently preventing an upside break.\n\nMoreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2544 high to $0.2415 low is acting as a resistance. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2500 on the same chart. Therefore, an upside break above the $0.2500 level might start a fresh increase. The next key resistance is near the $0.2550 level, above which the price could test the main $0.2620 resistance.\n\nOn the downside, an immediate support is near the $0.2450 level, followed by $0.2420. If there is a bearish break below the $0.2420 and $0.2400 support levels, the price may perhaps retest the main $0.2350 support in the near term.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is clearly trading in a bearish zone below $0.2550 and the 100 hourly SMA. It seems like there could be another dip towards the $0.2400 or $0.2350 support level. On the upside, the bulls need to gain strength above $0.2550 and $0.2620 for bullish continuation.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is slowly moving into the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is currently near the 50 level, with bearish signs.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2420, $0.2400 and $0.2350.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.2500, $0.2550 and $0.2620.", "description": "Ripple price is under pressure below $0.2500 against the US Dollar, similar to bitcoin.
