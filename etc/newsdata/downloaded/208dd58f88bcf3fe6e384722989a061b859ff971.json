That is the million dollar question.\n\nThe data suggests to pull the trigger before it\u2019s too late.\n\nAmazon\u2019s (AMZN) stock price has dropped in four of the past six years on the day following its third quarter earnings, points out Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. The company\u2019s third quarter earnings report is often very volatile as the digital beast spends aggressively ahead of the holiday season. That usually doesn\u2019t jibe well with always inflated expectations on Wall Street regarding Amazon\u2019s profits.\n\nThis go around looks to be no different. Amazon shares fell 6% in pre-market trading on Friday as third quarter earnings badly whiffed consensus forecasts, coming in at $4.23 a share versus the $4.58 a share expected. Profits were held back by Amazon\u2019s $800 million investment in the expansion of one-day delivery services. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services sales growth slowed to 35% versus 37% in the second quarter. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also saw its profit margins come under pressure amid increased competitive activity in cloud services.\n\nThe company warned on fourth quarter profits, as it prepared to spend $1.5 billion more in its one-day delivery rollout.\n\nFILE- In this Aug. 3, 2017, file photo, packages ride on a conveyor system at an Amazon fulfillment center in Baltimore.

Amazon\u2019s stock has gained each year in the following 90 days after negative reactions (four of the past six years) to its third quarter earnings, returning an average of 6%. Thill\u2019s research looks at the last six years of performance. The stock has outperformed the Nasdaq Composite by an average of 100 basis points. Including the two years out of the past six where Amazon\u2019s stock rose following third quarter earnings, the stock has returned an average of 8% in the following 90 days and outperformed the Nasdaq by 500 basis points.\n\nThill continues to rate Amazon\u2019s stock at a Buy with a price target of $2,180. Makes sense, per the data.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
