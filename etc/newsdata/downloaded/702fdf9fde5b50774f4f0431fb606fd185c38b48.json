We can all censor ourselves as we\u2019re singing right?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExplaining his viewpoint, the R&B singer continued: \u2018But as far as I\u2019m concerned, she\u2019s Latina right? Latina [is] black.\n\n\u2018A lot of people don\u2019t acknowledge that but she\u2019s black. She\u2019s from Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Mexicans believe it or not, we all here [rubs his skin], we all history.\u2019\n\nGina has apologised for causing offence (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nWhen asked by the photographer if Gina \u2018gets a pass\u2019, Shawn replied: \u2018Yes, come on man, she\u2019s cool.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s Latino. If you go to Puerto Rico right now there are people my shade right now.\u2019\n\nShawn then compared Gina to Love & Hip Hop star Amara La Negra who has Dominican heritage but is of a darker skin tone.\n\nThe paparazzo challenged the comparison by stating: \u2018But Gina don\u2019t look like that though,\u2019 to which Shawn replied: \u2018Alright but she still got the gene. Puerto Ricans, Latinos, you\u2019re all black.\u2019\n\nAfter Gina received further criticism for her first brief apology, she issued a full statement to Instagram on Wednesday, apologising for any \u2018pain\u2019 she may have caused.\n\n\u2018In song or in real life, the words that I spoke, should not have been spoken. I grew up loving the Fugees and Lauryn Hill. I thoughtlessly sang along to the lyrics of a favorite song, and even worse, I posted it,\u2019 the actress wrote.\n\n\u2018The word I sang, carries with it a legacy of hurt and pain that I cannot even imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018What consequences I face for my actions, today none will be more hurtful than the personal remorse I feel. Watching my own video playing back at me, has shaken me to my core. It is humiliating that this has to be a public lesson but it is indeed a much deserved lesson.\n\n\u2018I feel so deeply protective and responsible to the community of color but I have let this community down.\u2019\n\nShe concluded the message: \u2018I have some serious learning and growing to do and I am so deeply sorry for the pain I have caused.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Gina has found herself at the centre of a race row.\n\nLast year, she was accused of being \u2018anti-black\u2019 when she claimed black women get paid more than their Latina and Asian counterparts in Hollywood.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
