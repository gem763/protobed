But her perfect picture could be shattered when a natural disaster strikes.\n\nFinn (Rob Mills) is excited for his brother\u2019s return but he\u2019s distracted when he and Bea (Bonnie Anderson) get into an argument over Scarlett (Christie Whelan Browne).

They\u2019re both hugely taken aback when, during their row, she accidentally calls him Patrick.\n\nShocked by the moment, Finn turns his attention back to his brother, putting the argument out of his head as he attempts to get in contact with Shaun (Brad Moller) to find out his plans to return.
