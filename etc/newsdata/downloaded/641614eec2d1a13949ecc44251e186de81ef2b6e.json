The Republicans spoke on condition of anonymity so they could speak more freely about closely held conversations.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how close Sessions was to making a decision or the seriousness of the exploration. He has until 5 p.m. Nov. 8 to decide whether to be a last-minute entry into the 2020 race. The Alabama Republican Party sets the deadline.\n\nSen. Doug Jones, a Democrat, won the 2017 special election to fill Sessions\u2019 seat by defeating Republican Roy Moore. Republicans see recapturing the seat in the once reliably red state as a top priority in 2020.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, Moore and others.\n\nSessions was a beloved figure among state Republicans after serving in the Senate for 20 years. But a new campaign would face the impact of a soured relationship with President Donald Trump.\n\nSessions left the Senate to become Trump\u2019s first attorney general. He was ousted after enduring repeated public mocking from Trump for recusing himself from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nAn unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s bashing would affect a Sessions campaign, particularly if the president\u2019s criticism continued through a Senate race.\n\nTrump in June called his selection of Sessions as attorney general his \u201cbiggest mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say if I had one do-over, it would be, I would not have appointed Jeff Sessions to be attorney general,\u201d Trump said in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nTrump won 62 percent of the vote in Alabama in 2016.\n\n\u201cI suspect Sessions would become an immediate front-runner if he were to enter the race,\u201d said David Hughes, a political scientist at Auburn University in Montgomery.\n\nHughes noted that Alabama voters picked Moore over a Trump-backed primary candidate in 2017 and that \u201cSessions has done little to distance himself from Trump.\u201d\n\nIn a telephone interview Monday night, Merrill said, \u201cObviously, if he became a candidate, that would change the dynamic of the race dramatically.\u201d\n\nMerrill said he and others would have to decide what course of action their campaigns would take if Sessions entered the race.\n\nSessions received a standing ovation when he spoke at a party fundraiser earlier this month in which he reiterated his support for Trump.\n\n\u201cHe is relentlessly and actually honoring the promises he made to the American people,\u201d Sessions said in the speech at Huntsville.\n\nSessions did not mention the Senate race but criticized Democrats as the party that sees \u201cmore government\u201d as the answer.\n\nHe said he believes Republicans could achieve historic congressional majorities in 2020, but he cautioned that they must show they are responding to the concerns of average Americans.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is exploring the possibility of a run for his old Senate seat, according to three Republicans", "authors": ["Kim Chandler", "Alan Fram"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jeff_sessions_exploring_senate_run.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
