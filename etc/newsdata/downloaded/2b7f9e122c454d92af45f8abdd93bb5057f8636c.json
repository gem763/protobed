Try forgiving someone.", "language": "en", "text": "Researchers asked 1,423 American adults to rate themselves on how likely they were to forgive themselves for the things they did wrong and forgive others for hurting them. The participants also answered survey questions about how they had slept in the past 30 days, how they would rate their health at the moment, and how satisfied they were with their life.\n\nAD\n\nThe results suggest people who were more forgiving were more likely to sleep better and for longer, and, in turn, have better physical health. They were also more satisfied with life. This was true of people who were more forgiving of others and people who were more forgiving of themselves \u2014 although forgiving others had a stronger relationship with better sleep.\n\nAD\n\nWhile this study is small, it echoes the findings of several studies in recent years that indicate better slumber for those who are able to let go of their anger.\n\nForgiveness of self and others \u201cmay help individuals leave the past day\u2019s regrets and offenses in the past and offer an important buffer between the events of the waking day and the onset and maintenance of sound sleep,\u201d wrote the researchers, led by Luther College professor Loren Toussaint. Otherwise, as many troubled sleepers have experienced, we might have too much on our minds to get any rest.\n\nAD\n\nPeople who don\u2019t forgive, researchers explain, tend to linger on unpleasant thoughts and feelings, such as anger, blame, and regret. This can involve painful rumination \u2014 focused attention and repetitive thoughts about distress. That resentment or bitterness could be detracting from sleep quality and well-being, the study suggests.\n\nAD\n\nWhile we know sleep is important for overall health, this study offers a new perspective on forgiveness as a key factor in achieving healthy sleep. The more we can minimize ruminating about unresolved issues, the better our sleep (and, in turn, our overall health) may be.\n\nAs the researchers state: \u201cIf forgiveness of others and self-forgiveness can help people cope with the day\u2019s psychological and emotional burdens in a way that frees one\u2019s mind and promotes a more restful mental state for sleep, then they support the health-related process of sleep in meaningful ways.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis study doesn\u2019t prove that forgiveness causes better sleep, but it does suggest people who tend to forgive also tend to sleep better.\n\nSo while it isn\u2019t guaranteed to resolve your sleeping issues, forgiveness could be something to try out. Letting go of lingering difficult thoughts and feelings may help you not only avoid that stare-down with your clock tonight, but also feel better tomorrow.\n\nA version of this piece was originally published in Greater Good Magazine, published by the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley.
