On some sites it was prominently displayed, but in many cases it was difficult to find. Some sites have simply published a reference to the initial government announcement.\n\nThose that had no mention of the helpline at all include organizations representing some of Canada's largest participatory sports, like hockey, soccer, figure skating, gymnastics and basketball.\n\n\"We've done what we can,\" Duncan told CBC News when asked why the helpline hasn't received the prominence that was promised. \"There's more to be done to raise the profile,\" she said.\n\n(abuse-free-sport.ca)\n\n\"I am responsible for the national sport organizations. In order to work down to the club level I have to work with my sport ministerial colleagues across the country. That's what I have done.\"\n\nIn a follow up email from Duncan's office, her press secretary wrote, \"Sport Canada has reached out on a number of occasions to all of the sport organizations we fund, and will continue to work with them to raise awareness of the helpline in the coming months.\"\n\n60 calls to helpline\n\nCBC also reached out to dozens of local sports organizations across the country. None of the people who answered on behalf of the clubs said they had heard of the helpline or been given any new direction about how to deal with concerns about abuse.\n\nJesse Harrison is part of the Leaside Baseball Association, a midtown Toronto club where nearly a thousand children play baseball. Harrison first spoke to CBC News in February about what he saw as the lack of communication from larger sports organizations about how to handle concerns about abuse. In spite of the pledge from sports ministers at the provincial and federal level to do more, he says he's heard nothing from Baseball Ontario or Baseball Canada.\n\n\"We haven't seen any of those ideas or guidelines come to us directly,\" he says. \"And, really, the conversation has stalled. So it's difficult to pursue in a more meaningful way if we're not getting anything in return.\"\n\nThe Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC), the agency that runs the helpline, says it has not distributed any promotional posters to date but has a social media campaign planned for the fall. The SDRCC says 60 people have contacted the helpline since it was established.\n\nJesse Harrison is part of the Leaside Baseball Association, a midtown Toronto club where nearly a thousand children play baseball. He's says he\u2019s heard nothing from Baseball Ontario or Baseball Canada about new guidelines for dealing with issues of abuse. (Leaside Baseball Association)\n\nSandra Kirby, a former Olympic rower and University of Winnipeg professor who has done extensive research on the problem of abuse in sports, says the solutions that have been proposed are simply \"missing the boat.\"\n\nKirby says the helpline is \"only as good as your ability to get out into the hearts and minds of the athletes in sport.\"\n\n\"We have all of this information out there \u2014 nobody in sport could say that they don't understand this is an issue \u2014 and yet sport organizations themselves seem moribund to do anything,\" Kirby said, \"partly out of fear and partly out of they just simply hope it's going to go away or it's going to be in somebody else's sport and not theirs.\"\n\n'Off the radar'\n\nOnly days after CBC News published its initial investigation in February, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for sport, physical activity and recreation stood with Duncan at a meeting in Red Deer, Alta., and signed a declaration promising to make safe sport a priority.\n\nDays after CBC News published its initial investigation in February, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for sport, physical activity and recreation stood with federal minister Kirsty Duncan at a meeting in Red Deer, Alta., and signed a declaration promising to make safe sport a priority. (Terry Reith/CBC)\n\nCBC reached out to those same ministries to ask what steps they've taken, and found approaches differ from province to province. Most said they are still working on developing additional safe-sport policies.\n\nIn the meantime, 22 more coaches in Canada have been charged with sexually abusing a minor since the CBC News investigation. Those cases involve 12 different sports.\n\nDuncan defended the federal government's response, pointing to jurisdictional issues that prevent her from forcing changes at the provincial and local level.\n\n\"There is always work to be done,\" she said. \"I started a conversation in this country that had never happened 18 months ago \u2014 and you can imagine the pushback. People didn't want to talk about this.\"\n\nSandra Kirby, a former Olympic rower and University of Winnipeg professor who has done extensive research on the problem of abuse in sports, says the solutions that have been proposed so far are simply 'missing the boat.' (Trevor Brine/CBC)\n\nKirby says the commitment to forcing change, from the club level to elite sport, needs to be stronger.\n\n\"How the provinces do it and how the clubs do it has not been addressed in any way,\" Kirby says. \"What we need is partnership from the provinces to step up and help with the local and the provincial level. But the national promise has not been realized.\"\n\nHarrison and others hope the momentum for real change hasn't been lost.\n\n\"I feel like it's a relatively easy thing to begin to address and start those conversations. But it's definitely fallen off the radar, off the topic list, for sure.\"\n\nIf you have information to share on this story, please contact Lori Ward at lori.ward@cbc.ca or Jamie Strashin at jamie.strashin@cbc.ca.
