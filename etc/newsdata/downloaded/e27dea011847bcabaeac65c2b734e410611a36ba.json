As a spokesperson for athletics\u2019 governing body put it: \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been an official policy to drop the phrase \u2018fastest loser\u2019 but the move away from it reflects the evolution of the language. We want to recognise making finals or making it through a heat is a good thing, whatever place an athlete finishes.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nWith Qatar two hours ahead of Britain, much of the world championships will be shown in primetime on the BBC. That should provide a rare showcase for a British team that the UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, insists is \u201cincredibly well prepared\u201d and primed to do better than many expect.\n\nHowever, Black said the 1500m star Laura Muir, one of Britain\u2019s most reliable medal hopes alongside the sprinter Dina Asher-Smith and heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson, was not in ideal shape as she attempts to recover from a calf injury sustained in July.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Laura Muir is one of Britain\u2019s best medal hopes, although Neil Black, UK Athletics performance director, cast doubt on whether she is in ideal shape. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\n\u201cLaura doesn\u2019t have to race a lot to be able to race well,\u201d said Black. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting there in a week\u2019s time and the biggest challenge is the obvious one of three races in four days. That\u2019s the bit that\u2019s kind of unknown. Laura will be there in good shape. And then we\u2019ll all see what the outcome is.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed about her condition, Black added: \u201cEverything suggests she\u2019s in good shape, progressing towards great shape. The honest phrase is Laura Muir is still going to be competitive to win a medal.\u201d\n\nA spectacular 10 days of athletics almost certainly lies ahead. In the men\u2019s 200m the American Noah Lyles says he is going for Usain Bolt\u2019s world record, while the long-standing world record for the 400m hurdles could be broken by any one of Karsten Warholm, Abderrahman Samba or Rai Benjamin, the son of the former West Indies fast bowler Winston.\n\nIAAF make extra provisions for extreme heat at world championships in Qatar Read more\n\nOn the women\u2019s side the Belgian Nafi Thiam is aiming to show again she is the best female athlete in the world in the heptathlon while Asher-Smith is looking to become the first Briton to win three medals at the same world championships.\n\nHowever, many inside the sport are nervous about the potential poor crowds after the Guardian\u2019s story this week about only 50,000 tickets being sold \u2013 which will lead to migrant workers and children with free tickets being bused in. For context 700,000 people watched the same event in London in 2017.\n\nRichard Kilty, who is captaining Britain, believes the sport needs an injection of razzle and dazzle to appeal to more fans. \u201cI think we need to do a better job of building the image of our athletes,\u201d he said. \u201cEddie Hearn has just rejuvenated boxing completely by creating rivalries and then suddenly everyone\u2019s a boxing fan now. I think it\u2019s going to take someone like him to come in and slightly change the world.\u201d", "description": "On the eve of the world championships athletics\u2019 governing body is to move away from using the term \u2018fastest loser\u2019 after complaints from some inside the sport", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7377724544cc8e392d7746d578a6ebfb698c0cbe/686_339_5020_3011/master/5020.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0012af031612340da3d4a69f58513021", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
