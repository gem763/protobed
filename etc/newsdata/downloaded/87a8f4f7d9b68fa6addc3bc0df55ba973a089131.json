Over in China they\u2019ve got much more resources financially, they can put a better event on.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t really want to have to go through qualifying, but I suppose I\u2019ll have to if I want to play in quality tournaments.\u2019\n\nO\u2019Sullivan is a big fan of the Shanghai Masters (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAs always, you can never be certain whether the mercurial O\u2019Sullivan will stick to what he is saying or do something entirely different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving already skipped the first two Chinese ranking events of the season, Ronnie\u2019s new plan clearly has not kicked into gear yet, although he is playing in the World Open in Yushan later this month, an event he has not attended since 2010 and retained his Shanghai Masters title.\n\nIt is still yet to be seen if the Rocket will play in the Triple Crown events this season, with the UK Championship, Masters and World Championship all held in England.\n\nThe reigning UK champion declared earlier this year that he was not going to bother, but it would remain a huge shock for him not to enter and he admits that he has not finalised his plans.\n\n\u2018I really haven\u2019t scheduled what I\u2019m going to play in at the moment. I\u2019ll decide nearer the time,\u2019 continued the world number two.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d love to play a full schedule but I just couldn\u2019t do it, I\u2019d never be at home and I\u2019d be living out of a suitcase.\n\n\u2018Sometimes you have to look at the end of it and think \u201cis the prize worth the effort?\u201d For me, it\u2019s not so I choose to play minimum events because it\u2019s something for me to do.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO\u2019Sullivan returns to Crawley on Wednesday for a second round match at the English Open against Yuan Sijun.\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan reignites attack on English Open: \u2018Every day in Crawley is a day lost in my life\u2019\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan says he could still have 15 years left at the top of snooker", "description": "Ronnie O'Sullivan is planning a dramatic revamp of his playing schedule that would see him play the majority of events in China and only 'the odd few in the UK.'...", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1081120088_1571153759.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
