Outside of work she dressed as, and could simply be, who she was: a woman.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, it came to a boiling point,\u201d Stephens told The Daily Beast. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I could go forward. I knew for sure I couldn\u2019t go backwards, so where does that leave me? And if that\u2019s all there was, what was the point? So, in November 2012 I considered taking my life and getting it over with. I stood in the backyard with a gun to my chest for an hour. But I came to the conclusion that I couldn\u2019t do it\u2014that I liked me too much. I made the choice to live. And it was shortly after that that I drafted the letter to my boss.\u201d\n\nIt was that letter that Stephens, 59, said led to her getting fired by her employer, R.G. and G.R. Harris Funeral Homes in Michigan, after six years of working as a funeral director. Stephens claims she was fired after she told her boss in the letter that she was transgender, and would henceforth be dressing according to the firm\u2019s female dress code.\n\nIn March last year, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Stephens\u2014whose case is being supported by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC)\u2014was unlawfully fired and that federal sex discrimination laws protect transgender people. The funeral home is challenging that ruling at the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Oct. 8, Stephens\u2019 case will be one of three to be heard by SCOTUS, which will consider\u2014and ultimately adjudicate\u2014if current sex discrimination laws protect LGBTQ people from workplace discrimination. The cases represent as momentous a moment for LGBTQ rights and equality at the Supreme Court as the Defense of Marriage Act and marriage equality rulings did in 2013 and 2015 respectively.\n\nThe cases are being heard against the backdrop of the stymied passage of the Equality Act, which would enshrine anti-LGBTQ discrimination protections in federal law (28 states presently have no protections for LGBTQ employees). The Act passed in the House of Representatives, but has little chance of getting passed in a Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe other two SCOTUS cases will test if the current sex discrimination laws cover gay people, and will be heard together as they both focus on sexual orientation.\n\nIn 2010, Donald Zarda was fired from his job as a skydiver with Long Island company Altitude Express after coming out to a customer. Zarda died in a base jumping accident in Switzerland in October 2014, and his sister Melissa and his surviving partner Bill Moore are spearheading the case in his memory at SCOTUS, supported by the ACLU alongside lawyer Greg Antollino and Pam Karlan of the Stanford Law School Supreme Court Litigation Clinic.\n\nThe trial court found that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin, did not cover sexual orientation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit reversed that holding, claiming that sexual orientation discrimination was a subset of sex discrimination.\n\nLike Stephens\u2019 funeral firm, Altitude Express has taken the case to the Supreme Court. They argue that Zarda had touched a female customer \u201cinappropriately\u201d (which Zarda\u2019s family denies). Zarda had told the customer that he was gay, as he prepared to jump with her, to defuse any awkwardness with them being strapped together.\n\nThat customer, argued Zarda\u2019s lawyers, was homophobic. Altitude also alleged Zarda had behaved \u201cinappropriately\u201d in the workplace. Zarda claimed part of the discrimination he endured was because he \u201cdid not conform to the straight male macho stereotype.\u201d\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t know if he would have believed it would get this far, but he would be really excited to see it go as far as it has. I know he\u2019s glad everyone has continued the fight \u201d\n\nMelissa Zarda told The Daily Beast: \u201c It\u2019s pretty heavy. I feel like I owe this to my brother to fight as long as I can and if this case results in helping anybody in the LGBTQ community it just feels like the right thing to do. It is incredibly meaningful to do this in my brother\u2019s memory.\n\n\u201cWe talked about the case non-stop. This was so important to him. He was so upset by this case. I don\u2019t know if he would have believed it would get this far, but he would be really excited to see it go as far as it has. I know he\u2019s glad everyone has continued the fight.\u201d\n\nIn the third case, Gerald Bostock, a gay man fired from his job as a child welfare services worker by Clayton County, Georgia, also claims to have been a victim of unfair discrimination based on his sexual orientation. As summarized in SCOTUSBlog, Bostock claimed that the county falsely accused him of mismanaging public money, when it really fired him for being gay.\n\nThe district court ruled that Title VII did not cover sexual orientation, a ruling upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, and so Bostock has brought his case to the Supreme Court.\n\nBostock and his lawyer, Brian J. Sutherland, a partner at Buckley Beal in Atlanta, declined to be interviewed for this article. In a statement, Sutherland wrote: \u201cAt this time, we believe our court filing demonstrates the importance of this issue. We look forward to the hearing and to helping ensure all LGBTQ people are free from discrimination in the workplace.\u201d\n\nIn responses to the three cases submitted to SCOTUS, the Trump administration\u2014led by Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco and Department of Justice attorneys\u2014has argued that Title VII does not include sexual orientation or gender identity, and therefore it is perfectly legal to fire and discriminate against people on the grounds that they are LGBTQ.\n\n\u201cUnfavorable treatment of a gay or lesbian employee as such is not the consequence of that individual\u2019s sex,\u201d the Justice Department argued, \u201cbut instead of an employer\u2019s policy concerning a different trait\u2014sexual orientation\u2014that Title VII does not protect.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice has also filed an amicus brief in support of Stephens\u2019 employer, meaning that the federal government\u2014as well as arguing it should be legal to fire and discriminate against someone just because they are transgender\u2014is effectively arguing against itself as the EEOC is on Stephens\u2019 side.\n\n\u201cWe have a path to victory\u201d\n\nRia Tabacco Mar, senior staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & HIV Project , told the Daily Beast: \u201cI certainly know better than to predict what the Supreme Court is going to do, but I do think LGBT folks have reason to be optimistic here. I think we\u2019re right on the law. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination because of sex, and I think as the lower courts rightly recognized it is impossible to disentangle discrimination because of sex and discrimination because of sexual orientation.\u201d\n\nTabacco Mar said that over 200 well-known American businesses have submitted testimonies to the Supreme Court arguing in the LGBTQ employees\u2019 favor in their cases.\n\n\u201cThey say that inclusive workplace policies are good, and have increased productivity and retention rates,\u201d said Tabacco Mar. \u201cThey are asking the Supreme Court, \u2018Regulate us now, we want these rules to apply to us.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Zarda\u2019s case, said Tabacco Mar, if he had been a woman, she would not have been punished for being attracted to men; therefore his sex is key.\n\nThe cases involve observing statute, not the Constitution, Tabacco Mar asserted, so those justices on the court \u201cnot inclined to take an expansive view on whether the Constitution protects LGBTQ people this case is free of that question. You do not have to agree that Obergefell (the marriage equality case) was rightly decided to find for the LGBTQ employees here. I think that is critical when you look at the current make-up of the court compared to when the marriage equality decision was taken.\n\n\u201cWe have a path to victory that includes justices who may not agree with the marriage equality decision, but who can interpret the words of the statute to mean what it says. Those are the votes we need. Those are the votes I think we can get. I think these cases will test whether the conservative justices are true to their textualist principles, which actually cut in favor of the LGBTQ employees here.\u201d\n\nAnthony Michael Kreis, visiting assistant professor of law at Chicago-Kent College of Law, told The Daily Beast that even conservative judges have recognized trans people enduring discrimination because of \u201cclassic sex stereotypes.\u201d A concern, he said, would be if \u201chot button topics\u201d like bathroom access and dress codes would give the SCOTUS justices\u2019 pause.\n\nWhen it came to sexual orientation, Kreis\u2019 mind went back to Chief Justice Roberts stating, when the court debated same sex marriage in 2015, \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s necessary to get into sexual orientation to resolve this case. I mean, if Sue loves Joe and Tom loves Joe, Sue can marry him and Tom can\u2019t. And the difference is based upon their different sex. Why isn\u2019t that a straightforward question of sexual discrimination?\u201d\n\n\u201c Kavanaugh is more of a typical conservative as we think of them, but he is a textualist and these arguments are very grounded in textualism. If you get Justice Kavanaugh on board with the sex/sexual orientation analysis you probably have Chief Justice Roberts too \u201d\n\nThis echoes in the arguments over the employment cases, said Kreis. But whether the court will rule in favor of LGBTQ people is \u201c50-50,\u201d Kreis said.\n\nChief Justice Roberts could provide the swing vote, Kreis thought, but if he doesn\u2019t all eyes will go to Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch. \u201cEven though they are both conservative, they apply very different principles, which means they could diverge on their decisions. Kavanaugh is more of a typical conservative as we think of them, but he is a textualist and these arguments are very grounded in textualism. If you get Justice Kavanaugh on board with the sex/sexual orientation analysis you probably have Chief Justice Roberts too.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration telling the Supreme Court that it should be legal to fire someone just because they are gay is \u201cpartisan gloss,\u201d and not reflected in the decision of the lower court, Tabacco Mar said. \u201cThey are trying to make into a political issue when really what this is about is what text of the statute means.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court is mindful of the era it is sitting in, said Kreis. \u201cThe court doesn\u2019t like to be out of step with public opinion, particularly on hot-button issues like this. They will really think about these cases.\u201d\n\nKreis laughed. \u201cOf course, there is also the chance I am wrong, and their priorities about LGBTQ rights and claims color their perspectives too much and they won\u2019t make the connections that others do. Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch are the ones to watch. It is conceivable and plausible that either one of them votes for the LGBTQ employees, but time will tell.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to Stephens\u2019 case, Tabacco Mar said, there was \u201cno way\u201d to separate her being fired because she is transgender from her sex. There was no objection to her work performance. \u201cThe only objection was to her living openly as a woman\u2014something the employer would have had no objection to if Aimee had been assigned female at birth. She was assigned male, which led to her employer rejecting who she was, and so putting her out of a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a powerful history of Supreme Court interpretation of the sex provision to include broad forms of discrimination based on sex,\u201d said Tabacco Mar.\n\n\u201c We can\u2019t be judged on the kind of man or woman we are. Our sex should be irrelevant to employment decisions. The same applies to men like Don\u2014men who are not considered the \u2018right kind of men\u2019 because they are gay or bisexual \u201d\n\nThe ACLU is referring to a 1989 SCOTUS case involving Ann Hopkins, a Price Waterhouse employee who sued her employer after she was denied partnership because her firm objected to how she dressed and did her make-up.\n\n\u201cAimee\u2019s case flows on from that: We can\u2019t be judged on the kind of man or woman we are. Our sex should be irrelevant to employment decisions. The same applies to men like Don\u2014men who are not considered the \u2018right kind of men\u2019 because they are gay or bisexual.\u201d\n\nSome observers have said the sex discrimination laws should not be \u201cextended\u201d in this way\u2014but Tabacco Mar disputes these LGBTQ cases are \u201cextending\u201d the law at all. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about applying the law to a particular form of discrimination.\u201d\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hopkins, it made clear that gender stereotyping was as actionable as sex discrimination. Such cases test our increasing understanding of what sex discrimination looks like, said Tabacco Mar. In 1998, the Supreme Court accepted that a male oil rig worker had been sexually harassed by his male co-workers; it was conservative justice Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision for the court.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court will not be willing to roll over for the Trump administration just because the Trump administration says so,\u201d said Tabacco Mar. \u201cHopefully, the justices will continue their trend of skepticism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not asking for anything special. We just want the basic human rights that we should already have\u201d\n\nWhen we spoke, Aimee Stephens was \u201changing in there.\u201d She had a terrible cough, and was resting after one of her regular dialysis treatments, her kidneys having failed in 2014. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few good days in the last week, so all in all I\u2019m OK,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cIt\u2019s very draining. I come home exhausted and take a nap, after each treatment. I guess I will be on dialysis as long as I live.\u201d\n\nOverall, Stephens wishes her case wasn\u2019t headed to SCOTUS, \u201cbecause I already won in the lower court. But it is what it is. Maybe now we\u2019ll get clarification on it from this point on and know where we stand. When it first started out, I didn\u2019t even think about the fact it could end up in front of the Supreme Court, but now that it has: Bring it on and let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, having moved beyond the thoughts of suicide she recalled at the beginning of this article, Stephens gave her boss the letter informing him of her transition, laying out \u201cwhere I was at in my life and what was going on and where I needed to be. It said I would come back from vacation in my true self, dressed appropriately in women\u2019s attire according to what that was at the funeral home.\u201d\n\nHer boss looked at the letter, \u201cand said, \u2018This is not going to work,\u2019 and handed me a letter of dismissal along with a severance package.\u201d If she accepted those terms, said Stephens, she would have \u201csigned away all the rights I had to see him in court.\u201d Stephens came home, talked to her wife Donna, and both decided to reject the severance package. Then they got in touch with the ACLU.\n\n\u201c I had been doing my job and doing it well, and I didn\u2019t understand why what was happening had any effect on my job performance. Basically, they fired me because I was transgender \u201d\n\nStephens\u2019 former boss, Thomas Rost, has said he would have felt he would be \u201cviolating God\u2019s commands\u201d by allowing Stephens to come to work as a woman. As Bloomberg Businessweek reported, the right-wing group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing the funeral home, said that letting Stephens come to work dressing and presenting as a woman would \u201cdisrupt the healing process of grieving families.\u201d\n\nGetting fired from the funeral home, \u201cbothered me a lot,\u201d said Stephens, \u201cbecause I had been doing my job and doing it well, and I didn\u2019t understand why what was happening had any effect on my job performance. Basically, they fired me because I was transgender.\u201d\n\nIn a lower court, Stephens discovered her employer had used the reasoning that she didn\u2019t adhere to the dress code.\n\n\u201cI was perfectly willing to adhere to the women\u2019s dress code. His problem was he didn\u2019t see me as a woman. He saw me as a man and therefore if I did not wear a coat and tie I wasn\u2019t adhering to his dress code. He never got to see me as a woman.\u201d\n\nThe case, said Stephens, had been \u201ca rollercoaster ride,\u201d after she realized this kind of discrimination had not just happened to her. \u201cI took up this fight not just on my behalf, but for everybody, all transgender people.\u201d\n\nStephens was born and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and moved to Michigan 20 years ago. She thinks her sisters realized \u201csomething was different\u201d with her. Her biological father died when Stephens was 1, the man her mother remarried \u201cis the only dad I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d She took on his surname as her own.\n\nFrom a young age, Stephens said she knew she was \u201cdifferent,\u201d but didn\u2019t know how\u2014this was many years before the internet or when trans issues were discussed. \u201cI was brought up down South. It certainly wasn\u2019t something we talked about every day.\u201d\n\nFinally, through the internet Stephens realized she wasn\u2019t alone, but wasn\u2019t sure \u201cwhat to do about it.\u201d She started to see a supportive therapist in 2008, Stephens began to \u201cget clues about what I needed to do.\u201d\n\nDonna, Stephens said, has been \u201cright by my side. We\u2019ve known each other basically all our lives. We were best friends growing up.\u201d\n\n\u201c I wrote my dad a personal letter, and put pictures in it. When he had read it, he told my sister that I made a better-looking woman than I ever did a man \u201d\n\nBoth had been married previously before marrying each other 20 years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together ever since,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cWe didn\u2019t foresee any reason to grow apart (after her transition). You don\u2019t just walk away and leave your best friend. It took her a little while to accept everything that was happening as it would anybody, but there was no talk of us getting divorced or me moving out. We worked through it and here we are.\u201d\n\nStephens\u2019 mother died in 2003, long before her transition in 2012. \u201cI wrote my dad a personal letter, and put pictures in it. When he had read it, he told my sister that I made a better-looking woman than I ever did a man.\u201d He died this year.\n\nStephens\u2019 sisters are very supportive. They all speak two or three times a week. The rest of her family has been mostly supportive, except for one aunt \u201cwho told me I didn\u2019t exist any more\u201d when Stephens began her transition. \u201cSince then, she\u2019s come around. In fact I saw her, earlier this year down south, and she came up to me, hugged my neck and told me, \u2018I still love you, I still care about you.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c If you can\u2019t be true to yourself you\u2019re not only not going to be true to yourself, you\u2019re not going to be true to anybody or anything else. It\u2019s not easy, it never will be, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s worth it in the end \u201d\n\n\u201cIf I had to do it all over again I would,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cAnd to other transgender people on the verge of coming out, wondering what to and how to do it, I would say, more than anything else you have got to be true to yourself. If you can\u2019t be true to yourself you\u2019re not only not going to be true to yourself, you\u2019re not going to be true to anybody or anything else. It\u2019s not easy, it never will be, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s worth it in the end.\u201d\n\nStephens got her first job in a funeral home in the early \u201980s when still at college in North Carolina. The work bothered her at first. She couldn\u2019t sleep after helping prepare the first body she ever embalmed. \u201cBut I told myself, \u2018Look, you gotta work here if you want to stay in school. Learn to live with it, or else.\u2019\u201d Her career in funeral homes began.\n\nBefore her health problems, after her funeral home job ended, Stephens worked as an autopsy diener, cutting and removing organs for pathologists to look at. It was a natural flipside of the funeral home work she had done, preparing dead bodies for families and loved ones to view.\n\n\u201c I hope they recognize the protections are there, and that being transgender is not new. We\u2019ve always been here \u201d\n\nAfter her kidneys failed, Stephens has not been able to work. She is \u201cwiped out\u201d after her three-times-a-week treatments, but she would love to return to work (the ideal job would occupy her for the other four). If she could work again, she would teach funeral home-related skills at mortuary school.\n\nBut first, there is the case to fight at the Supreme Court. Stephens hopes the justices look at the history of favorable lower court rulings, uphold those rulings, and \u201conce and for all say there are protections for LGBTQ people. I hope they recognize the protections are there, and that being transgender is not new. We\u2019ve always been here. It is just now there\u2019s enough of us to come forth, and that it\u2019s open for discussion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re human beings. We deserve the same basic human rights as everyone else has. That\u2019s all we\u2019re asking for. We are not asking for anything special. We just want the basic human rights that we should already have anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for Donald, and for all LGBTQ people\u201d\n\nThe last years of Donald Zarda\u2019s life before his tragic death in 2014 were \u201cpretty much\u201d dominated\u201d by the case, his sister Melissa, a graphic designer, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe talked about the case non-stop. This was so important to him.\u201d\n\nDonald loved skydiving, Melissa said. \u201cIt was everything to him. Before the case it was all he talked about.\u201d There were always videos and photographs to see, and Donald went back to school to get a degree in aviation-related management and administration. \u201cAnything that involved being in the air was all he cared about.\u201d\n\nAn \u201cincredibly smart\u201d young boy, Donald was always intrigued by airplanes and air travel. Both his mother and father had pilot licenses. As an adult he spent a lot of time skydiving with friends and others who shared his passion. Melissa is scared of heights, and \u201ca huge regret\u201d was that she never jumped with her brother. He was warm, generous, and loving as a brother, and loved sharing his professional passion with others.\n\nDonald\u2019s family was immediately supportive after he came out; \u201cit was almost not an event,\u201d said Melissa. He did so in his mid-20s. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was delaying telling us for any other reason than he was busy traveling the world and skydiving. He was not around that much.\u201d\n\nHe died in 2014. \u201cJust hearing you say it gave me goosebumps,\u201d said Melissa. \u201cEven years later the emotion tied up with it is still that intense. He kept our family together. We\u2019re still tight, but he was such a force. It has been a devastating loss, unbelievably hard.\u201d\n\nDonald felt strongly that he was a victim of homophobia. \u201cHe absolutely was a fighter,\u201d said Melissa. \u201cHe could not stand anything unfair. He felt he had been discriminated against, and was immediately prepared to fight. He knew it was wrong, and he was going after it. He wanted to stand up, in case it happened to anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201c I can\u2019t bear the idea of anybody not feeling like the rights that are allowed to me are not allowed to them. It\u2019s just not fair \u201d\n\nFighting the case in her brother\u2019s memory \u201cis obviously a surreal thing,\u201d said Melissa. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how far this has gone. It has totally taken me out of my comfort level. But it was a no-brainer. Of course, we wish he was here to see this and for us to fight this with him.\u201d\n\nBefore the case, Melissa herself, \u201clike so many people,\u201d didn\u2019t realize that LGBTQ were not protected against discrimination in the workplace. \u201cI can\u2019t bear that. I can\u2019t bear the idea of anybody not feeling like the rights that are allowed to me are not allowed to them. It\u2019s just not fair.\u201d\n\nHad Donald been alive, he would have been grateful for everyone\u2019s support, and \u201cthen buckle down and fight as hard as he could knowing what was at stake. That would have made him fight harder.\u201d It motivates Melissa too. \u201cThis has been so upsetting. We saw how badly it hurt him, and we hear from LGBTQ people about the discrimination they have suffered. We are fighting for Donald, and for all LGBTQ people.\u201d\n\nThe Equality Act\u2014and what happens after SCOTUS decides\n\nA pro-equality decision from SCOTUS would be historic, said Tabacco Mar. \u201cThis is about the ability to earn a living, put a roof over our head and food in the refrigerator, rent an apartment, provide for ourselves and keep ourselves safe.\u201d\n\nA ruling in favor of the LGBTQ workers, Tabacco Mar said, would also send a powerful message about the unacceptability of anti-LGBTQ discrimination in many contexts; a decision against the workers \u201cwould send a deeply disturbing message about the membership of LGBTQ people in society, pose a barrier to inclusion, and place LGBTQ people at the higher risk of violence and discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe cases are taking place alongside the frustrated progress of the Equality Act. Tabacco Mar said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything less legitimate than getting a decision from the Supreme Court to say it\u2019s illegal to fire anyone 'cos they are LGBTQ. After all, marriage equality came from SCOTUS.\n\n\u201c There are contexts where federal law simply has a gap which Congress is going to have to fill \u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, we will need action from Congress to expressly state that it\u2019s illegal to discriminate against someone because they are LGBTQ for two reasons. One is we want to be crystal clear, to the extent there is any ambiguity in the word \u2018sex\u2019 for employers, that there is no question in anyone\u2019s minds.\n\n\u201cSecondly, federal law prohibits sex discrimination in some, not all, contexts. It prohibits discrimination in the workplace, schools, and healthcare. But it does not protect against discrimination in places of public accommodation, like bakeries. So there are contexts where federal law simply has a gap which Congress is going to have to fill.\u201d\n\nIn the lower courts, President Trump has appointed a number of conservative judges, with anti-LGBTQ records and who would not be favorable to such claims, Anthony Kreis said.\n\nIf SCOTUS rules in favor of the LGBTQ people in these three cases, \u201cwill the lower court judges be as fair and impartial with such cases as we would like them to be?\u201d he asked. Like the ACLU, for Kreis, a positive ruling would \u201ccommunicate something very powerful and positive more generally about LGBTQ people.\u201d\n\nIf SCOTUS doesn\u2019t rule in favor of the LGBGTQ workers, then all eyes turn to the currently stymied progress of the Equality Act. Kreis said a negative decision could embolden those who would like to discriminate more against LGBTQ people.\n\nPolitically, Kreis thinks a SCOTUS ruling against the LGBTQ workers would not energize Trump supporters as much as forming an issue to energize progressive voters\u2014suburban voters, and particularly educated suburban women in places like Maine, northern Georgia, and Denver, he said\u2014to get behind Democrats standing for Senate, with an eye on getting the Equality Act finally passed if the Senate became Democrat-controlled.\n\n\u201c You don\u2019t need both the SCOTUS decision and the Equality Act, but there is no harm in having both \u201d\n\nFor Kreis, \u201cThe Equality Act would be the surest way to effect non-discrimination as it would expressly protect people around sexual orientation and gender identity, and it would breathe a tremendous amount of life into civil rights in this country.\n\n\u201cThat being said, it is also important for SCOTUS to show it understands the relationship between sexual orientation and transgender discrimination and sex discrimination. If the court rules in favor of LGBTQ people, it is important to codify that in statutory law, and because it sends an important message beyond expanding protections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the belt and suspenders approach. You don\u2019t need both the SCOTUS decision and the Equality Act, but there is no harm in having both. They\u2019re achieving the same goal, twice, and that\u2019s a fine thing to do.\u201d", "description": "On Oct. 8, the Supreme Court is set to hear three landmark LGBTQ workplace-discrimination cases.
