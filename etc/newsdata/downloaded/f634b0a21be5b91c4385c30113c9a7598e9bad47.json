It\u2019s not \u2018could\u2019 it have a big impact. It \u2018will\u2019 have a big impact.\u201d\n\nFor another playing his last Rugby World Cup match, Canada winger DTH van der Merwe, it\u2019s \u201cthe make-or-break of our World Cup.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look back to our 2015 World Cup performance, we could\u2019ve beat Italy, but lost by five points. We lost to a kick against Romania, so that\u2019s classified as a failed World Cup. That\u2019s all our eggs in one basket, to get a win against Namibia.\u201d\n\nYears of heartbreak will end for the winner at intimate Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium.\n\nNamibia seeks a first win ever in the Rugby World Cup, having lost all previous 22 matches over the last 20 years.\n\nCanada has played in three extra Rugby World Cups and won seven matches, but none of its last 10 dating to 2011.\n\nTo Phil Davies, coaching his last match for Namibia, victory would validate the team\u2019s steady improvement across the Welshman\u2019s five-year tenure.\n\n\u201cThis squad would be able to achieve something the previous five haven\u2019t. That will keep enthusiasm up,\u201d Davies says.\n\n\u201cIt will show the investment we\u2019ve had has shown progression and development. The last World Cup, Namibia qualified through points difference. This World Cup (qualifying) we haven\u2019t been beaten in Africa for four years. We\u2019ve changed the average age of the squad from 31 to 24. There\u2019s a lot of things that have developed and grown. It\u2019s a big ask to say it all comes down to one game, but it is a big opportunity.\u201d\n\nNamibia has never beaten Canada but may have an edge from two extra days of preparation after playing New Zealand last Sunday. Davies made six changes, and yet lock Tjiuee Uanivi, wing JC Greyling and fullback Johan Tromp will have started all four pool games.\n\nLate to the party, Canada will play its fourth match in 17 days. They have had to replace four injured players, and the latest reinforcement, loose forward Dustin Dobravsky, is in the reserves. This crunch games comes only five days after a pounding from South Africa, but captain Tyler Ardron says \u201cwe\u2019ve got no excuses, we\u2019ll put everything we can out on the field.\u201d\n\nThe Canadians believe they match up with Namibia\u2019s forwards and can win it out wide through the back three of wings van der Merwe and Jeff Hassler, and fullback Patrick Parfrey, all former national sevens players.\n\n\u201cCanada with their sevens background, against Namibia\u2019s flair and courage, it\u2019s going to be a cracking game of rugby,\u201d Davies says.\n\nHis center disagrees. De la Harpe desperately wants to convert his last chance, and isn\u2019t concerned about aesthetics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a fancy game. It\u2019s going to be very physical, very tough, but I believe this team has got the character for it,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019m thinking about is getting the win. I don\u2019t care how. If it\u2019s the last kick, if it\u2019s 50-odd points, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nNamibia: Johan Tromp, Leslie Klim, Johan Deysel (captain), Darryl de la Harpe, JC Greyling, Cliven Loubser, Eugene Jantjies; Janco Venter, Wian Conradie, Prince Gaoseb, Tjiuee Uanivi, Johan Retief, Johannes Coetzee, Torsten George van Jaarsveld, Andre Rademeyer.
