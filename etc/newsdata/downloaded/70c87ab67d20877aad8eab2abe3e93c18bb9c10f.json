It didn't take long before she heard rumblings that Cats composer Andrew Lloyd Webber was 'going to write an original song for Victoria, the cat lead.'\n\nWeeks later, Swift got a call to rehearse her song Macavity at Lloyd Webber's home. After a run through, while sitting at a piano, he began to play a melody that she had 'never heard before.'\n\n'He's playing this, and I'm running through all the score of Cats, like, this is not in the original musical. There's no top line. So, a top line on a song is the words and the melody that somebody sings,' she explained.\n\nDream gig: Swift, 29, plays the flirtatious Bombalurina in movie musical of Cats\n\nAnother dream gig: Swift also co-wrote the lyrics for the new original song Beautiful Ghosts with Cats famed composer Andrew Lloyd Webber\n\nFrom there, the Pennsylvania native began to sing along to the melody, which resulted in her co-writing the lyrics of their song Beautiful Ghosts that will be sung by Hayward.\n\nIn an added bonus, Lloyd Webber told the Daily Mail that Swift will get to perform another version of Beautiful Ghosts over the film's end credits.\n\nDuring the Beats 1 interview, Swift also revealed she started out in musical theater as a kid and that the genre 'made her fall in love with performing as a medium.'\n\nLike the stage version, the star-studded film version of Cat is based on the poems of T S Eliot. The movie, slated to hit theaters December 20, also stars James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen and Rebel Wilson.", "description": "Taylor Swift revealed that she didn't have to audition for her role in the movie musical of Cats and how she benefited from Les Miserable screen test in 2012.", "authors": ["Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/01/20204258-0-image-a-53_1572051581836.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
