Meanwhile, King Princess\u2019 debut album is a strong first project from a young artist with a sound all her own. Frank Ocean feeds his fans with \u201cDHL.\u201d And Rex Orange County doubles down on his Gen Z style.\n\n\u201cLose You to Love Me,\u201d Selena Gomez\n\nFor a pop star, Selena Gomez has maintained an unusual amount of distance between her personal life and her music. So maybe that\u2019s why \u201cLose You to Love Me,\u201d the first official single from the singer-actor-entertainment-phenomenon heralding a new album after four years of one-off releases, feels so surprising. Sonically, it\u2019s an emotional ballad; lyrically, it\u2019s a breakup anthem about healing; and as far as production goes, it\u2019s a soaring bit of pop. There were plenty of cooks in the kitchen on this one, including writers Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter and producers Mattman & Robin and Finneas, brother of Billie Eilish. Together, they\u2019ve concocted something that is universal in its appeal, but hints at specifics that have played out in tabloids for years. We\u2019re used to hearing Gomez twist her voice into subtle murmurs over infectious beats; here, we hear her more clearly and cleanly than we have in a long time. That\u2019s no mistake, of course. Welcome to the new era of Selena Gomez.\n\n\u201cRaising Hell,\u201d Kesha feat. Big Freedia\n\nWhen we last heard from Kesha, she was clearing the air after a years-long record-label struggle; Rainbow was cathartic and emotional, with moments of self-empowerment. \u201cRaising Hell,\u201d her new single featuring rapper Big Freedia, promises she has plenty of party left to share. \u201cI\u2019m only f-cked up in my Sunday best, no walk of shame \u2019cause I love this dress,\u201d she sings. \u201cHungover, heart of gold, holy mess, doin\u2019 my best \u2014 b-tch, I\u2019m blessed.\u201d This is Kesha at her catchiest, with snappy lyrical snippets just begging for a singalong. \u201cRaising Hell,\u201d which takes its cues from gospel with electronic production and some rollicking \u201cTimber\u201d-like moments, doesn\u2019t counteract her maturity; it just accepts that sometimes, it\u2019s fun to be wild \u2014 a lesson Kesha has long been teaching.\n\n\u201cIf You Think It\u2019s Love,\u201d King Princess\n\n\u201cIf this is love,\u201d King Princess sighs, her voice manipulated into an electronic echo, \u201cI want my money back, cause I could use the check to spend it on a better heart to wear upon my sleeve.\u201d Then there are a few plinking synths, but in the end this is just about the lyrics. King Princess (real name: Mikaela Straus) became a name to know in 2018 with \u201c1950,\u201d a warm, retro-R&B-feeling viral hit; she also had a Mark Ronson co-sign and earned cult-favorite status. On her debut album, out this week, the 20-year-old New York artist promises plenty more in store. \u201cIf You Think It\u2019s Love\u201d closes out the album \u2014 it\u2019s more of an outro than a full track \u2014 but it still packs a punch. It\u2019s both a meditation on change (which came to Straus shockingly fast in the wake of newfound fame) and a reflection on accepting things for what they are. Sometimes, the simplest things speak the loudest.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The unhurried bass is so deep and resonant you feel it in your bones; his lyric flow is almost menacing in its low-register unbroken consistency during the middle section of the track. Ocean isn\u2019t bothered with things like typical song structure, and the result \u2014 as heard here \u2014 is a track that reads more as a meditation and a flex, or a prelude to work yet to come.\n\n\u201cFace to Face,\u201d Rex Orange County\n\nThere\u2019s something refreshingly direct about Rex Orange County, the low-key, young English artist who\u2019s been a Tyler the Creator collaborator and released his third album, Pony, this week. \u201cFace to Face,\u201d like the best of his music, is sweet and melodic, mixing a little bit of everything \u2014 gentle rap-singing, retro-feeling electronic production, chill R&B energy \u2014 into one undeniably pleasant listen, overlaid with relatable, youthful lyrics. There\u2019s a reason Rex Orange County is racking up millions of streams and a considerable Gen Z fanbase; Pony suggests he\u2019s just getting started.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "description": "New music from Selena Gomez, Kesha, King Princess, Frank Ocean and Rex Orange County rounds out a strong week of new music.", "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/selena-gomez.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
