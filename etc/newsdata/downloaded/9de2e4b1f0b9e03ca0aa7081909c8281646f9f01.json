Beyond these routine events, however, it is two others over the past year that are destined to shape the role of air power in our security calculus.\n\nThe decision to strike the Balakot terror camp was a bold departure from India\u2019s traditional reluctance to use air power because of possible escalatory implications and demonstrated the government\u2019s willingness to rewrite the rules of engagement in the proxy war. Not surprisingly, the CAS\u2019s anniversary message said: \u201cStrategic relevance of this is the resolve of political leadership to punish perpetrators of terrorism. There is a major shift in government\u2019s way of handling terrorist attacks.\u201d\n\nThe larger message to the IAF and indeed its sister arms is that finally, the potency and flexibility of air power in furtherance of our security interests, including in the realm of proxy warfare, has been recognised and with this must change outdated operational and defence management notions. How the \u2018three sena bhawans\u2019 adapt to this development, will be watched keenly by students of national security.\n\nThe second event was the message emanating from Beijing\u2019s recent military parade showcasing China\u2019s emergence as an increasingly ambitious global power with aeronautics and missile technology close to matching the best internationally. This China has achieved by steadfastly working to a strategic plan in aeronautics that talks of developing aeronautics with Chinese characteristics, which it broadly defines as technological progress, self-reliant advancement, aeronautical patriotism and priority to civil over military aeronautics. Further, this is being driven by the highest political leadership.\n\nThe larger message is that of the intimate link between a nation\u2019s self-reliance in defence systems and its global power ambitions. For India, which is the second-largest importer of weapon systems internationally, this sobering message coming from a nation with whom we have an unresolved border dispute, can only be ignored at our peril.\n\nNot surprisingly, the CAS\u2019s maiden press conference on the eve of Air Force Day highlighted both these subjects. Alluding to the Balakot operation, the CAS confidently asserted that the IAF will respond to any provocation by Pakistan and targets, as directed by the leadership, will be suitably dealt with.\n\nThe CAS also emphasised on IAF\u2019s continued commitment to indigenous development in keeping with the \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative and his proactive involvement to ensure that indigenisation remains one of IAF\u2019s main focus areas, and in times to come, indigenised equipment becomes its mainstay. Such an assurance must come as a surprise to those who fault the IAF for preferring import over indigenous, finding in this a smoke-screen to camouflage all that ails defence research and production in Indian aeronautics. Preferring status quo, they also fail to acknowledge that a blueprint of a National Aeronautics Policy, proposed by Dr Kalam when he was president of the Aeronautical Society of India, gathers dust in South Block.\n\nThe government has thrown down the gauntlet for the IAF not be found wanting when called upon to unleash the nation\u2019s air power. The IAF in turn has shown a mirror to the government by unreservedly committing itself to indigenous programmes in the hope that the latter will, in turn, introspect and formulate a National Aeronautics Policy, without which the IAF will be reduced to fighting with what they can get indigenously.", "description": "With Air Chief Marshal Bhaduria taking over reins as the chief of air staff (CAS), the Raksha Mantri formally accepting the first Rafale aircraft in France and IAF celebrating its 87th anniversary, the air force...", "authors": ["Brijesh Dhar Jayal"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Graphic-1-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
