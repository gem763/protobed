How does one fight an enemy if that enemy isn\u2019t named?\n\nSAG-AFTRA\u2019s biennial convention was attended by 400 delegates and the resolution was passed unanimously. It calls for a \u201cfree and unencumbered press\u201d, which is hardly bold and controversial language except in the minds of anti-Trump attendees, apparently. The resolution made headlines in the industry\u2019s publications. The press is protected in the First Amendment, after all. One phrase was included, though, just in case there is any nuance in the wording of the resolution. (There isn\u2019t.) \u201cEnemy of the people\u201d was specifically included.\n\n\u201cWe are living in an extraordinary time when the news media has been attacked as spreading false stories and as an enemy of the people,\u201d the resolution read. \u201cSAG-AFTRA has on at least two occasions since the last national convention, issued strong statements on behalf of a free and unencumbered press. \u201cSAG-AFTRA believes that the entities that employ journalists must do everything they can to ensure their freedom, protection and safety,\u201d it added. \u201cAs a proud labor union representing more than 160,000 broadcasters, actors and entertainers, the union stands with all of its members in ensuring that the basic rights of an unrestricted and independent press continue to be defended.\u201d\n\nNo American would argue against a resolution that supports the freedom of the press. What many Americans don\u2019t support, though, is the way in which much of the news is delivered in the Trump era. Lots of journalists and reporters seem to have forgotten how to report the facts without editorializing. There is, indeed, a lot of fake news out there, no matter who is making the accusation. Trump, as is his way, points his finger at members of the press or television news networks, or anyone else who has irritated him and calls them out. It isn\u2019t new for a president to have a contentious relationship with the press. What is new is a president who punches back every day.\n\nThere is irony in this resolution, too. \u201cThe four-day event is closed to members of the press, except for SAG-AFTRA delegates who are also broadcasters.\u201d Oh. Not very transparent, are they?\n\nPresident Trump himself is a member of the union. He even participates in the union\u2019s pension fund like the rest of the members. For example, in 2015 he included a SAG pension fund in financial disclosures.\n\nIn 2015, one of Trump\u2019s financial-disclosure forms revealed that he had $110,228 in a SAG pension fund. That sum, which seems surprisingly high, comes mostly courtesy of his hosting gigs on The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice. Trump has also made several cameo appearances in movies like Home Alone 2 and TV shows like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\n\nThe leftists in Hollywood included Trump as one of their own until he ran for president as a Republican, then all bets were off. Funny how that happens. It must be a constant thorn in their side that he is a fellow union member.\n\nThis resolution wasn\u2019t the union\u2019s first aimed at Trump.\n\nIn October, 2017, SAG-AFTRA issued a strong statement in support of a \u201cfree and unencumbered press\u201d after Trump threatened to strip networks of their broadcast licenses. That resolution also did not name Trump.\n\nOther resolutions were on the agenda but none of those made headlines.\n\nOther resolutions include expanding protections for LGBTQ performers and sexual harassment and assault survivors; banning casting directors from serving as members of the union\u2019s board of directors; establishing a code of conduct and disciplinary measures for members who carry out acts of misconduct against other members, staff and management, and purchasing a building to serve as the union\u2019s national headquarters instead of leasing. There\u2019s even a resolution calling on the national board to create a committee to craft a detailed proposal for eliminating the convention itself.\n\nReboots are popular these days in the entertainment world. Looks like the union is just rebooting the standard Orange Man bad rhetoric we hear every day. Freedom of the press in America is alive and well.", "description": "Union convention", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5b9e5dc0-35ab-45eb-83ac-958cd86d093f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
