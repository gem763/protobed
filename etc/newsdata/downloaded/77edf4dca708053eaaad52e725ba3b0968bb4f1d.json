An article about healthy eating advises her fans to aim for their \u2018leanest liveable weight\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m not signed up to Goop. Funnily enough, I\u2019m not in the market for a \u00a3126 stone essential oil diffuser. But these words set all my alarm bells ringing.\n\nAfter all, as Cambridge scientist Giles Yeo, an expert in how our brains control our weight, rightly says, \u2018many people will take it to mean they should be as thin as possible\u2019.\n\nSusanna Reid (pictured) who had her photos used by scammers selling weight loss products, argues that celebrities should be extra careful with the products that they endorse\n\nYikes. When I waded through the pseudoscience in the offending piece \u2014 an interview with U.S. psychologist Traci Mann \u2014 I found Traci isn\u2019t quite saying that, thank heavens. She\u2019s since insisted: \u2018The article is specifically about not trying to lose too much weight and not doing anything unhealthy or extreme. The phrase \u201cleanest liveable weight\u201d refers to the leanest weight you can be without strict dieting.\u2019\n\nBut I read every word, and I agree with Dr Yeo: the language is wide open to misinterpretation \u2014 especially when it\u2019s read by eager-to-be-thin Goop fans, who would do anything to have a figure like Gwyneth.\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest in a long line of bizarre and controversial endorsements by Goop for the likes of bee-sting facials, \u2018moon dust\u2019 smoothies and, most disturbingly, vaginal steaming \u2014 which left one woman with severe burns.\n\nGwyneth\u2019s response is to say she doesn\u2019t read everything on Goop. That\u2019s not good enough. People with her profile and influence need to be aware that power and success come with responsibility.\n\nYou are accountable to people who look up to you, and if her website \u2014 which is reportedly worth millions \u2014 promotes advice that might be misinterpreted by those susceptible to eating disorders, that account-ability isn\u2019t being upheld.\n\nGwyneth may claim she\u2019s just as entitled as anyone else to share opinions online, but the truth is people buy into products endorsed by celebrities, so we have to be extra careful. That\u2019s something I learned when I got caught in a diet scandal myself.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow (pictured) responded to an article advising her fans to aim for their \u2018leanest liveable weight\u2019, by saying that she doesn't read everything written on Goop\n\nSix months ago, I received a message on social media from a follower, complaining she hadn\u2019t received the \u2018keto diet pills\u2019 she\u2019d ordered after I allegedly claimed they\u2019d helped me shed almost two stone.\n\nOther messages followed: one woman said her mother paid \u00a3100 after seeing me \u2018advertise\u2019 the pills, but they\u2019d never arrived.\n\nThen people told me they\u2019d seen dodgy ads for the pills with my face on pop up on Facebook \u2014 a site which is itself one of the main drivers of the \u2018compare and despair\u2019 culture, prompting people to look for easy weight-loss answers in the first place.\n\nI was furious and upset. I don\u2019t credit diet pills for my weight loss. I would never flog any \u2018weight-loss\u2019 supplement. It was all a con by scammers who\u2019d used my photo. Still, I was devastated that people were out of pocket because of an ad falsely bearing my name.\n\nOff-air gossip I was brought to tears on GMB by Vinnie Jones\u2019s account of his wife Tanya\u2019s death from cancer in July. Vinnie told how, when she was gone, he saw a bright light above him. He blew it a kiss and it vanished. He is convinced Tanya was letting him know she was free. There\u2019s nothing like a strong man who dares to be vulnerable.\n\nI also faced inquiries from friends concerned I had packed in my job to go into the weight-loss industry. One celebrity pal asked for help for a relative to lose weight, while a respected journalist wanted to slim for a wedding. I was outraged and horrified at how quickly this scam spread, all on the strength of my supposed endorsement.\n\nLuckily, the Advertising Standards Authority stepped in to take the ads down. But the sorry affair taught me how powerful a celebrity\u2019s face on a diet product can be \u2014 which is why it\u2019s enormously irresponsible to put anything out there without careful scrutiny.\n\nLosing weight should be done for health, not because a star claims to have a magic product or formula. A website run by a Hollywood beauty needs to hold sacred its responsibility to readers when it talks about weight loss.\n\nEven using the word \u2018leanest\u2019, for instance, presents many of us with an impossible task. My natural curviness means I will never be considered lean. I can be healthy, but lean \u2014 no.\n\nWhen I did lose weight, by the way, I did it because my doctor recommended it. My secret isn\u2019t a pill. I took individual steps to eat more healthily, cutting down on unhealthy snacking and the empty calories of alcohol.\n\nSusanna was unimpressed by Heston Blumenthal's (pictured) comments on the lack of female chefs\n\nI don\u2019t have a secret weapon or a magic tablet.\n\nAnd neither does Gwynnie.\n\nGet back in the kitchen, Heston!\n\nI\u2019m not sure why Heston Blumenthal, thinks he\u2019s an expert on women. The recently remarried chef \u2014 famous for snail porridge \u2014 claims there are so few female chefs because we can\u2019t lift heavy pots.\n\nTosh! A big Le Creuset dish weighs more than a baby, but women easily carry both. How else do mothers across the country whip up dinner every night?\n\nI hope Heston\u2019s left with a nasty taste in his mouth after the sour reaction to his comments.\n\nNo, Strictly\u2019s NOT fixed . . . and I should know\n\nRidiculous rigging accusations were thrown at me on Strictly in 2013 \u2014 saying that, as a BBC employee, I must have had a helping hand.\n\nIt\u2019s the same every year. This weekend when Dev Griffin and Dianne Buswell, got voted off, some viewers took to Twitter to say their phone line wouldn\u2019t accept calls. The BBC said the blockage affected everyone equally.\n\nSusanna argues that BBC's Strictly isn't rigged, despite viewers complaining that they were unable to vote for Dev Griffin and Dianne Buswell (pictured)\n\nIt must be hugely frustrating for voters, but it\u2019s not proof of rigging. The problem is celebs at the bottom of the leader board after the judges\u2019 scores will often get a surge of support from fans. Celebrities at the top are safe, too. It\u2019s the dangerous middle zone where fans have to do the hard lifting. Dev and Dianne were 10th \u2014 they desperately needed votes.\n\nUltimately Strictly is a talent show, but it\u2019s also a popularity contest. Sometimes, the most popular couples keep going as better dancers drop out. That\u2019s why ungainly Mike and Chris are still in \u2014 they put smiles on their fans\u2019 faces.\n\nFans are calling for the public vote figures to be published. That\u2019s one way to put the \u2018fix\u2019 rumours to bed.\n\nSusanna says heartbroken mother Charlotte (pictured) was the most powerful person in the Oval Office when she met President Trump\n\nOne lady Trump can\u2019t push around\n\nPresident Trump has been outflanked by the dignity of a British woman.\n\nAs Trump shook hands with Harry Dunn\u2019s heartbroken mother Charlotte, she pleaded with him to help and refused to enter the same room as the woman allegedly responsible for her son\u2019s death. She wants Anne Sacoolas to face justice on UK soil. The most powerful person in the Oval Office wasn\u2019t the President, but a mother fighting for her son. Trump must now send Mrs Sacoolas back.", "description": "Susanna Reid who had her photos used by scammers advertising weight loss products, argues celebs need to be careful with their endorsements.
