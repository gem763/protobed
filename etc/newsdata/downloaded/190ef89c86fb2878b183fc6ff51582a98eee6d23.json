Although they have been occurring daily, with tens of thousands rallying in the city centre, Friday\u2019s was expected to be the largest.\n\nAhead of the strike and in anticipation of the likely transport problems, Spanish carmaker SEAT \u2014 which is owned by the Volkswagen group \u2014 halted production at its Martorell assembly plant near Barcelona which employs some 6,500 people.\n\n\u2013 La Boqueria market shuttered \u2013\n\nIn Barcelona, Spain\u2019s top tourist destination, most of the stalls were shuttered in the city\u2019s famed La Boqueria market, and its renowned Liceu opera house cancelled Friday night\u2019s performance.\n\nIn the streets, there was far less traffic than normal, and at El Prat airport, 55 flights were cancelled, the AENA airports authority said.\n\nElsewhere in the region, many roads were blocked off, in some cases by demonstrators, in others by burning tyres or mattresses, and in one area activists had even strewn nails on the roads, causing punctures among passing cars.\n\nWith the region mired in chaos, football giants Barcelona and Real Madrid have been told to postpone next weekend\u2019s Clasico match, a hugely popular clash which had been due to take place at the city\u2019s Camp Nou stadium on October 26.\n\nThe Spanish Football Federation said the two clubs would agree on a later date to schedule the match. Both clubs had reportedly refused an offer to hold the match in Madrid.\n\n\u2013 Fourth night of unrest \u2013\n\nThe latest mobilisation came after a fourth night of unrest, which saw hundreds of young protesters going on the rampage in Barcelona, chanting \u201cindependence\u201d as they torched improvised roadblocks and tossed Molotov cocktails at police, who responded with foam rounds, AFP correspondents said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, around 25,000 students joined a midday rally outside Barcelona city hall, local police said.\n\n\u201cThe actions we have been staging over the past few days testify to the helplessness we feel as the Spanish state continues to reject (independence) and threaten us,\u201d said David, a 23-year-old accountant who did not give his family name.\n\nEmergency services said 42 people were injured in unrest across the region overnight, most of them in Barcelona.\n\nAnd police said they had arrested around 110 people since Monday\u2019s verdict, at least 11 of them overnight.\n\nSpeaking to AFP on Thursday, Berta Barbet, a political scientist at the University of Barcelona, said the demonstrations \u201cin their current size\u201d would likely only last a week.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s explosive decision has thrust the Catalan dispute to the heart of the political debate as Spain heads towards its fourth election in as many years, which will be held on November 10.", "description": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 Spain\u2019s protest-hit northeast was gripped by a general strike Friday as thousands of \u201cfreedom marchers\u201d were due", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/5adc41_barcelona-was-burning-fourth-night-on-thursday-as-separatist-anger-sentencing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
