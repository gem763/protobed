We don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d\n\nLoughlin, 55, and husband Mossimo Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 to alleged scam mastermind William \"Rick\" Singer through his fraudulent Key Worldwide Foundation to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella recruited onto the University of Southern California's crew team, even though neither girl had rowing experience.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN WAS 'OBSESSED' WITH GETTING DAUGHTERS INTO USC, REPORT CLAIMS\n\nThe couple rejected the plea bargain that many other parents allegedly involved in the case (including Felicity Huffman) accepted. Giannulli, 56, and Loughlin were consequently slapped with additional charges of money laundering and conspiracy and would face up to 40 years behind bars if convicted on all charges against them.\n\nHuffman was sentenced last week to 14 days behind bars, a $30,000 fine and 250 hours of community service after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in May. She confessed to paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her older daughter's answers on the SAT.\n\n'FULLER HOUSE' STARS SEEM TO REFERENCE LORI LOUGHLIN IN KIDS' CHOICE AWARDS SPEECH AMID COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL\n\nLoughlin's onscreen husband, John Stamos, previously addressed her exit from the show similarly.\n\n\u201cI haven't been on the show yet and it hasn't come up, so I'm going to talk to some people about it this week and see what's going on,\" he told Entertainment Tonight. \"I'm just going to wait a little longer before I talk about it. It's a difficult situation for everyone involved. I don't mean just on our side.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast month, Stamos told GQ of Loughlin's criminal case, \u201cI gotta be careful. I want to wait until the trial happens, if it does, or whatever the result is, and then talk about it. \u2026 I\u2019ll tell you one thing that has been strange is: Honestly I can\u2019t figure it out. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d", "description": "Lori Loughlin's involvement in the college admissions scandal, which got her booted\u00a0from \"Fuller House,\" still has her co-stars reeling from her untimely exit from the Netflix revival of the classic sitcom.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/juan-pablo-di-pace-lori-loughlin-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
