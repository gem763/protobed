The department said Anderson \u201cconfessed that he made up the story\u201d because he didn\u2019t want to work his 11 a.m. shift at Hardee\u2019s.\n\nAnderson was charged with misuse of 911 and knowingly giving false information to law enforcement. Both charges carry a $500 apiece bond. He\u2019s still at Polk County Jail.\n\n\u201cIf his name was Jussie he\u2019d have gotten away with it,\u201d a Facebook user posted on the department\u2019s thread Tuesday night, referencing yesterday\u2019s controversial development in which prosecutors dropped all 16 charges against \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jessie Smollett but did not exonerate the TV star.\n\nSmollett had reported he\u2019d been the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago but law enforcement believed he\u2019d made the story up.\n\nBack to the Florida man, the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Department maintained a similar sense of humor: \u201cOn the bright side, Brian didn\u2019t have to go to his 11:00 a.m. shift at the restaurant,\u201d the Facebook post said.", "description": "Polk County Sheriff\u2019s deputies say Brian Anderson of Dundee, Florida, misused 911 by calling the emergency line to report an armed robbery so he could get out of his shift at Hardee\u2019s fast food restaurant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/hm0jhx/picture228490394/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/BrianAnderson%20PolkCS_fitted.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
