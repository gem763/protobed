Its participants have been gearing up to fight for more money and better Commonwealth co-ordination.\n\n1. Dan Tehan\n\nMinister for Education Dan Tehan heads up the education leaders. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nIn less than a year, the federal Education Minister saw off a Catholic-parents\u2019 revolt over school finances; commissioned a review of university funding (which he accepted in full), won an election and asked to stay in the education job.\n\nUniversities are regretting they wrote him off before the election. Three times in August he summoned vice-chancellors to meetings: in Wollongong, Canberra and Brisbane.\n\nThey all attended and they did not push back on the Wellings reforms, nor on the government\u2019s subsequent framework to counter foreign interference in universities.\n\nIt includes scrutiny of previously obscure arrangements for research collaboration, travel and sponsorship, which academics guard jealously. Tehan is somewhat underwhelming on TV but he is sure-footed in his portfolio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Vicki Thomson\n\nVicki Thomson, Chief Executive, Group of Eight (Go8). Attila Csaszar\n\nThe chief executive of the Group of Eight research-intensive Australian universities stayed friendly with the Education Minister before the federal election. And the Go8 was quick and comprehensive in accepting the findings of the Wellings Review into performance funding for universities. Thomson understands Canberra and everyone talks to her because she always knows something they don\u2019t. She\u2019s leading the fight for research funding, which is the real battle for universities.\n\n3. Mark Scott\n\nAs secretary of the NSW Department of Education, Scott is Australia\u2019s biggest employer of teachers and he\u2019s pushing them hard on accountability. Schools are getting new targets on literacy, numeracy and attendance. He pays more \u201chighly accomplished\u201d teachers than any other state and is fast-tracking strong teachers into leadership. Canberra likes all this stuff but it annoys the NSW Teachers Federation which used to think it pulled the ropes. He\u2019s not a fan of Naplan and he put noses out of joint by launching a curriculum review before the Feds did. But in education, authority is all about standing firm in the face of other people\u2019s wishes.\n\n4. Paul Wellings\n\nThe vice-chancellor of the University of Wollongong was the first to accept a $50 million gift from the Ramsay Centre to sponsor its Bachelor of Arts in Western Civilisation. Previous offers to other universities had been dogged by controversy. Yet Professor Wellings has kept out of the fray.\n\nIn December 2018, Minister Tehan commissioned Wellings to conduct a funding review, then bypassed Universities Australia and the sandstone universities when briefing VCs on the (harsh but realistic) report. Instead, all the VCs were asked to meet him at the University of Wollongong, where apparently Wellings did most of the talking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Fiona Mueller\n\nMueller has taught at schools and universities and been director of curriculum at the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority. As director of the education program at the Centre for Independent Studies, she recently railed against \u201cfads and trends\u201d in education, saying schools should focus on literacy and numeracy. Mueller may not be well known yet, but everything the CIS writes is read by the Coalition and it finds its way into government policy.\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.\n\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "The federal minister for education is more substance than flash at the top of the education heap.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3045%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_234/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f0f7b5bbf87e05c885bf210b61a0728d7dd3d10e", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
