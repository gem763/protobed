They have proved popular and profitable, apart from a disastrous period during the financial crisis a decade ago.\n\nAnnabel Brodie-Smith, of the Association of Investment Companies, says: \u2018Over the past ten years, private equity investment companies have generated returns for investors averaging 300 per cent \u2013 more than double the 125 per cent gain an investor would have made from the FTSE All-Share over the same period.\u2019\n\nShe adds: \u2018Businesses are choosing to stay private for longer which means that in many cases the lion\u2019s share of their growth has already happened by the time they list on a stock market. Reflecting this shift, more investment trusts are investing in private companies.\u2019\n\nMany investors have exposure to private equity perhaps in their Isas or pensions without even realising it via big, popular investment trusts such as Scottish Mortgage and F&C, which have allocated some of their portfolios to this area.\n\nPrivate equity is not a one-way bet. Unquoted companies can be volatile and illiquid \u2013 just ask investors in Neil Woodford\u2019s Equity Income fund who cannot get out of the fund because the manager is struggling to sell such investments quickly.\n\nInvestment trusts are more flexible than funds for ordinary investors as they can always sell their shares \u2013 even if they don\u2019t much like the price they sell them for.\n\nThere are about 20 investment trusts that focus on private equity.\n\nRyan Hughes, of broker AJ Bell, says: \u2018The investment trust structure is well suited to private equity investment because the fund manager doesn\u2019t need to worry about the daily buying and selling of the shares by investors. Instead they can focus on making long-term investments and managing the portfolio of companies they have invested in.\u2019\n\nWhat these different trusts invest in varies dramatically so it is important to research them carefully and be aware that charges are higher than more conventional trusts.\n\nThe best-known private equity specialist is 3i, which has been around since the 1940s and listed on the stock market in 1994.\n\nHughes says: \u2018Today it has a market value of \u00a310billion and a portfolio of some 30 companies spread across the world including both Belfast Airport and Audley Travel in the UK. It could make a useful first holding for those wanting private equity exposure.\u2019\n\nWhile 3i invests directly in companies, other \u2018fund of fund\u2019 style investment trusts \u2013 for example Standard Life Private Equity \u2013 spread their money around different private equity managers.\n\nOthers co-invest in direct deals alongside so-called private equity sponsors who invite other investors to join the deal. This is the strategy applied by NB Private Equity Partners.\n\nHughes says: \u2018The likes of Pantheon Ventures and HarbourVest have significant assets and look to build a diversified basket of private equity approaches right across the world to spread risk.\n\n'Pantheon\u2019s share price is up nearly 100 per cent in the past five years while HarbourVest is up nearly 150 per cent. Both have long pedigrees of investing in this area which is a key requirement when looking at private equity.\u2019\n\nThe fund of funds approach can be attractive as you end up with automatic diversification both by country and by business strategy. But Jason Hollands, of wealth manager Tilney, warns: \u2018The pitfalls are high total costs through multiple layers of fund costs and performance fees.\u2019\n\nWhile high returns are possible from private equity investments investors need to be comfortable with the greater risks involved.\n\nThe AIC\u2019s Brodie-Smith says: \u2018Private companies are often at an earlier stage of their development where things can easily go wrong.\n\n\u2018However, the share structure of an investment trust allows the fund manager to take a long-term view. They are never forced sellers which makes them an ideal way to invest in these hard-to-trade assets.\u2019\n\nMAKE SURE YOU\u2019RE IN FOR THE LONG TERM\n\nPrivate equity should be considered a long-term investment as investors will inevitably endure plenty of volatility along the way \u2013 but the rewards can be worth the wait. But to be safe, do not devote more than about 10 per cent of a portfolio to the sector.\n\nNB Private Equity Partners is a strong performing investment trust. Many of its current investments, which include office supplies business Staples and insurance brokerage USI, are US-based and because most have been made since 2016, there is the potential for exit windfalls.\n\nIts past performance has been attractive \u2013 over ten years \u00a31,000 has grown to \u00a35,280.\n\nRecently appointed chairman William Maltby says: \u2018Management incentives are much better aligned with private equity as they have the financial incentives to build value.\u2019\n\nThe fund\u2019s co-manager, Peter Von Lehe, adds: \u2018The perception is that all private equity investments end up in a flotation \u2013 or initial public offering. In fact, it is more common for an investment to be sold to a strategic partner or another private equity firm.\u2019\n\nMaltby has been brought in to market the trust and hopefully shrink the discount on the share price.\n\nA discount (or premium) is the measure of the share price versus the underlying assets \u2013 with NB Private Equity Partners currently trading at a 25 per cent discount. This makes it cheap for purchasers of its shares but anyone buying must hope that the discount will reduce.\n\nsally.hamilton@mailonsunday.co.uk", "description": "Many companies now choose to raise 'expansion capital' from private equity funds and only float on public stock markets later on - to 'crystallise' a high share valuation.", "authors": ["Sally Hamilton For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
