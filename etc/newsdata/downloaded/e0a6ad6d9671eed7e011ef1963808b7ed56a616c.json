And those efforts have fueled friction behind closed doors.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) ruled in a closed-door deposition Tuesday morning that any questions that might lead to the revelation of the whistleblower\u2019s identity were out of order, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nHis move frustrated Republicans. One source relayed that Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) ended up \u201cyelling at each other\u201d during a closed door deposition of Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council Director for European Affairs who testified that he raised internal concerns about Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nMeadows declined to discuss the deposition, but acknowledged the tension.\n\n\u201cThere is a great frustration among some of my Democratic colleagues because I know the rules extremely well,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.\n\nSchiff\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nTuesday\u2019s tensions underscored a growing fear among Democrats that Republicans may use parliamentary maneuvers to cast doubt on the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and disrupt future private and public impeachment hearings.\n\nTop congressional Democrats, including members of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, have been meeting privately for weeks to discuss messaging around the impeachment inquiry. And in a meeting on Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and other attendees discussed how to handle potential Republican efforts to reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity, according to two sources familiar with the talks.\n\nA third source who was in the meeting said they were not aware of discussion about protecting the whistleblower\u2019s identity. But the source did say that a good chunk of the discussion focused on how to handle Republican-led attempts to disrupt future public hearings, which impeachment investigators officially teed up on Tuesday. Some Democratic members have raised concerns that hearings could become chaotic political circuses with GOP lawmakers using the parliamentary rules to bog down the sessions. Republican members have used such tactics successfully during Judiciary Committee hearings led by Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.)\u2014most notably when Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski spent much of his time refusing to answer questions and berating his questioners. That hearing embarrassed many Democrats and was widely viewed as a mess, underscoring the need for new direction and leadership in oversight of the Trump White House.\n\nGoing forward, the third source said, Democrats wanted to better prepare for such \u201cstunts\u201d by setting firm rules for hearings.\n\n\u201cIt is going to happen at every turn, so we have to be prepared to address it,\u201d the source said. \u201cSo we may do it through the rule. And we need to come up with a message to deal with this.\u201d\n\nThe House Rules Committee is slated to vote on formal rules of the impeachment hearings on Wednesday, and the full House could vote on the new rules as soon as Thursday.\n\nMeadows said that any accusation that Republicans were trying to out the whistleblower were untrue because they did not know who to actually out.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who the whistleblower is, so there\u2019s no way that we can out someone that we don\u2019t know who it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI do believe that we need to hear from the whistleblower, but in terms of any ability to out the whistleblower, you have to know the name of him or her first and I can assure you that there\u2019s not a single Republican that knows the name of the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nSources have told The Daily Beast a different story. According to two knowledgeable people, a top staffer to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) has been circulating the identity of a person believed to be the whistleblower among House Republicans.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) exited the deposition and railed against Republican lawmakers for seemingly spending \u201cmost of their hours\u201d of questioning using a variety of tactics to try to get Vindman to reveal the whistleblower\u2019s name. She said that Republicans had been \u201crepeatedly halted\u201d from asking about the whistleblower during the session.\n\n\u201cIt certainly appeared they were trying to make sure they could put a universe of individuals who had been communicated with on the table,\u201d Wasserman Schultz told The Daily Beast during a break in the deposition.", "description": "Schiff moved to block questions that might reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity.
