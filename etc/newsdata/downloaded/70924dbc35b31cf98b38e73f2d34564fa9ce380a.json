Please refresh for live updates.\n\nWhen asked if he would implement mandatory buybacks for assault-style weapons, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke says, \"I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield.\"\n\nO'Rourke grew more passionate, as he continued: \"So many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa, there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell yes, we're going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against a fellow American anymore.\"\n\nMORE: 89% support background checks for all gun purchases, including private and gun show sales, per this week's @ABC News/WaPo poll; 86% back \u201cred flag\u201d laws allowing the police to take guns from individuals found by a judge to be a danger. https://t.co/841peOsUXt\n\nHarris, as multiple candidates on stage have already done, invoked former President Barack Obama and his signature campaign slogan when discussing her ability to carry out gun control via executive order.\n\n\"Yes, we can, because I'll tell you something. The way that I think about this is, I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you,\" Harris said.\n\nShe also praised Congressman O'Rourke's response to the mass shooting last month in El Paso, Texas.\n\n\"Beto, god love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy. You know, people asked me in El Paso, they said, you know, because I have a long-standing record on this issue,\" Harris said.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden says that since Sandy Hook, gun control \"went from a cause to a movement.\"\n\nHe then praised former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke for his response to the El Paso shooting:\n\n\"By the way Beto -- forgive me for saying Beto,\" Biden said.\n\nO'Rourke responded: \"That\u2019s okay. Beto's good.\"\n\nBiden continued: \"The way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful. To look into the eyes of those people, to see those kids, to understand those parents, you understand the heartache. But this is the problem. This is the problem.\"\n\nWhen Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was pressed on her eight-year tenure as a prosecutor in Minnesota, in which dozens of incidents where black men were killed by police, she responded, \"That's not my record ... when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them.\"\n\nShe added: \"I will make sure we don't just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act.\"\n\nThe conversation around racism then turned towards criminal justice reform, and Sen. Kamala Harris' record as a prosecutor came under direct scrutiny, a record she defended.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record. Let me be very clear. I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons. One, I've always wanted to protect people and keep them safe and second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias,\" Harris said.\n\n\"My plan is about making sure that in America's criminal justice system, we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement and that we work on keeping families intact. And as President of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete,\" Harris added.\n\nStory continues\n\n8:45 p.m.: Buttigieg talks up his 'Douglass Plan'\n\nAs he followed suit with his democratic rivals, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg addressed the system racism in the country, saying, it \"preceded this president and even when we defeat him, it will be with us.\"\n\n\"That's why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it,\" he continued. \"It's -- it's not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own ... This time, a Douglass plan that we invest right here at home. To make sure that we're not only dealing with things like the over-incarceration of black Americans.\"\n\n8:43 p.m.: Booker pitches a new path forward to attack 'systemic racism'\n\nBooker, fielding a question from ABC News' Linsey Davis, said a comprehensive criminal justice plan is central to combatting \"systemic racism,' in America.\n\n\"Racism exists, the question isn't who isn't a racist, it's who is and isn't doing something about racism,\" Booker said.\n\n\"It's nice to go back to slavery, but we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased, we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850. We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out and having a plan to do something about it,\" he added.\n\n8:41 p.m.: O'Rourke tackles racism in America standing on the stage of HBCU Texas Southern University\n\nWhen asked about addressing the racial divide in the country, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke said, \"Racism in America is endemic. It is foundational...I'm going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee's lead and sign a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundation. But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the white house and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke: \"Racism in America is endemic. It is foundational. We can mark the creation of this country not at the 4th of July, 1776, but August 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will.\"https://t.co/BOc41aqICy\ufffd#DemDebate pic.twitter.com/4kwZLxUqbt \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\nThe other Texan on stage, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro chimed in, first praising O'Rourke for his response to the El Paso shooting, and then arguing, \"We need to root out racism and I believe we can do that, because that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart. They need a leader to match that and I will be a president that matches that.\"\n\n8:38 p.m.: Outsider Yang injects his business background in health care debate\n\nAmid a tense moment between some of his fellow contenders, Andrew Yang said, \"We know we're on the same team here. We know we're on the same team. We all have a better vision for health care than our current president.\"\n\nHe then continued: \"I believe we're talking about this the wrong way. As someone who has run a business, I know that our current health care system makings it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. It's harder to change jobs. It's certainly harder to start a business. The pitch we have to make to the American people is, we will get the health care weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.\"\n\n8:36 p.m.: Castro goes directly after Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar tries to be the voices of reason\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Biden had a particularly contentious exchange, also over healthcare, with Castro accusing Biden of forgetting the details of his own healthcare plan.\n\n\"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in, and now you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that,\" Castro said to gasps from the audience.\n\n\"I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money,\" Biden said in defense.\n\n\"This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable. This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington. Scoring points against each other. Poking at each other,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n\"A house divided cannot stand. And that is not how we're going to win this,\" Klobuchar said.\n\n8:35 p.m.: Texas native O'Rourke argues some Democrats are offering a 'false choice'\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke spoke directly to his fellow Democrats to tell them, \"we've got to do better.\"\"I also think we're being offered a false choice between those who propose an all or nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto medicare and others who want to, as the vice president does, incrementally improve what we have, which will leave many, maybe millions uncared for,\" he said. \"We've got to do better.\"\n\n8:33 p.m.: Biden invokes Sanders 'socialist' label\n\n\"If you notice, nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this, large savings, the president -- my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer is going to give back if you negotiate as a union all these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They're going to give back that money to the employee?\" Biden asked Sanders.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, they will,\" Sanders responded.\n\n\"Well let me tell you something. For a socialist you got -- For a socialist, you have a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do,\" Biden said.\n\n8:31 p.m.: Kamala Harris cheers Obama, slams Trump\n\nAfter the second Democratic debate saw former President Barack Obama's legacy criticized, California Sen. Kamala Harris praised him: \"I want to give credit to Barack Obama for bringing us this far.\"\n\nShe then took aim at the current White House occupants, President Trump, telling the crowd, \"But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly on this subject, and not once have we talked about Donald Trump. So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\n8:29 p.m.: Buttigieg says he 'trusts the American people' on healthcare, Sanders hits back\n\nButtigieg also went after Medicare for All, and pitched his own plan that he dubs \"Medicare for All who want it.\"\n\n\"The problem, Senator Sanders, with the damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs, is that it doesn't trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not my way or the highway,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nSanders doubled down on his plan, Medicare for All, \"Medicare for All is comprehensive health care. Covers all basic needs, including home health care. It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not.\"\n\n8:27 p.m.: Amy Klobuchar seeks to carve out her path on health care by taking aim at Sanders\n\n\"Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals,\" said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \"And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill. And on page eight -- on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.\"\n\n\"That means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance. That's in four years. I don't think that's a bold,\" she added.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar: \"I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we've already got that in the White House. Houston, we have a problem. We have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show\" https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/oLXwsx3tv6 \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\n8:25 p.m.: Warren, Sanders join forces to defend health care plans\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders again defended their health care plans after Biden pointed out the high cost of the programs they are advocating for.\n\n\"So, let's be clear, I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company. I've met people who like their doctors, I met people who like their nurses, I've met people who like their pharmacists, I met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care,\" Warren said.\n\n\"Let us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we have spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on Earth,\" Sanders argued.\n\n8:23 p.m.: Biden keeps up the fight for Obamacare by taking aim at the progressive tag team\n\n\"This is about candor, honesty,\" the former vice president said. \"The tax of 2% that the Senator [Warren] is talking about, that raises about $3 billion. Guess what? That leaves you $28 billion short. The senator said before, it's going to cost you in your -- there will be a deductible - in your paycheck. You\u2019re gonna -- The middle class person, someone making 60 grand with three kids, they're going to end up paying $5,000 more.\"\n\n8:21 p.m.: Sanders forcefully defends Medicare for All after Biden's criticism\n\nSanders immediately defended his Medicare for All plan, and went after Biden for pushing for \"the status quo.\"\"Joe said that Medicare for All would cost over $30 trillion. That's right, Joe, status quo over ten years will be $50 trillion!\" Sanders said.\n\n\"We need -- we need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. I'll tell you how absurd the system is tonight on ABC, the health care industry will be advertising, telling you how bad medicare for all is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd,\" Sanders said.\n\n8:20 p.m.: Warren fields question on middle class taxes going up for health care\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren hedged when directly asked on if middle class taxes will go up under \"Medicare for All\"\"How do we pay for it? We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more. And middle class families are going to pay less,\" she said. \"That's how this is going to work.\"When pressed again, she responded, \"The answer is Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down and that's how it should work under medicare for all in our health care system.\"\n\n8:19 p.m.: Biden pushed back on Warren and Sanders' health care plans\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden kicked off the debate and pushed back on the health care plan being pitched by Warren and Sanders, Medicare for All.\n\n\"I think we should have a debate on health care. I think -- I know that [Senator Warren] says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack. I think it worked,\" Biden said.\n\n\"So as far, my distinguished friend, the senator on my left has not indicated how she pays for it and the senator has,\" Biden said gesturing to Sanders and Warren. \"In fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it, but it gets him halfway there.\"\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren: \"We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed healthcare in America, and committed this country to healthcare for every human being. And now the question is\u2014how best can we improve on it?\" https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/vvupnzXtUp \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\n8:17 p.m.: The top four candidates also give opening statements\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris targets President Donald Trump: \"But here's what you don't get. What you don't get you is that the American people are so much better than this. And we know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live or the party with which we're registered to vote ... And now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.\"\n\nSen. Kamala Harris has a message for President Trump in her opening statement: \"The only reason you were not indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime\" https://t.co/T37EaVOvlU #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/NGmmb90AxG \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 13, 2019\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pitched his long-standing message of fundamental economic change to benefit the country's working class: \"It goes without saying that we must and will defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country. But we must do more. We must do more. We have got to recognize that this country is moving into a form of society where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country.\"\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., talks up her Houston roots before touting why she should be at the top of the ticket: \"I got my big opportunity about a half mile down the road from here at the University of Houston, back when it cost $50 a semester ... I know what's broken, I know how to fix it and I'm going to lead.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Biden called back to a speech President John F. Kennedy gave when he launched the \"Moonshot Program\" to land on the moon: \"We're walking around with our heads down like \u201cwoe is me.\u201d We're the best-equipped nation in the world to take this on. It's no longer time to postpone. We should get moving. There's enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump,\" Biden said.\n\n8:12 p.m.: The next series of candidates give opening statements\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke invokes the shooting of El Paso in his opening remarks: \"On August 3rd, in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me ... The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is the cost and the consequence of his presidency ... The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now.\"\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker struck a unifying tone in his opening statement: \"That's the story of America. At our best, we unify, we find common cause and common purpose. The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party, not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose,\" Booker said.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg harkened back to the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, saying he wants to focus on the future of the country: \"We just marked the anniversary of 9/11. All day today I've been thinking about September 12th, the way it felt when for a moment, we came together as a country. Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n8:10 p.m. Andrew Yang officially announced plans to give 10 new individuals $1,000 a month\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang announced on tonight's debate stage 10 new people to receive the \"Freedom Dividend,\" a $1000 a month payment, his signature campaign policy, according to a Yang campaign source.

But the truth is that our problems didn't start just with Donald Trump and we won't solve them by embracing old ideas. We need a bold vision,\" he said. \"We have to win... it's what I can do in this race get back Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia and Arizona and finally turn Texas blue and say good-bye to Donald Trump.\"\n\n8:00 p.m.: The third Democratic debate gets underway\n\nThe third Democratic debate, hosted by ABC News and Univision, is starting from Houston's Texas Southern University.Here's how to watch the debate: The three-hour event airs on ABC, on Univision with a Spanish translation, locally on KTRK-TV and on ABC News Live.

(Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle via AP) More\n\nThe advisors said that Biden is not on the stage to attack other Democrats, but said that he would be pointing out substantive policy differences between himself and other candidates on the stage\u2014listing Warren and Sanders by name.\n\n\u201cYou will see him raise questions about how some of these plans that not just Senator Warren but Senator Sanders and others bring forward. how they\u2019re going to be paid for and how they\u2019ll be implemented,\u201d a senior adviser said.\n\nThe advisers were twice asked about how Biden would deal with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell specifically on guns, to which they said Biden would work with the other side in a bipartisan manner where he could. But if they prove uncooperative, Biden would take the fight directly to the American people and name check those in the GOP when he does, the advisers said.\n\nBiden's team downplayed the suggestion that his recent missteps on the trail were having an impact, and repeated their belief that voters know who he is, and that they will watch him on the trail and make their own determination on whether his age is an issue.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest mistake we can make in the campaign would be to not let Joe Biden be Joe Biden. People love that he speaks candidly, they know that sometimes he's going to misstate a date or a name or a location. But that's not you know--they also know that they're getting the real deal from him, when they hear from him,\u201d a senior advisor said.\n\nABC News' Mary Bruce and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.\n\n5:29 p.m. Sen.

We\u2019re too good \u2026 Mr. President, this is America. And we are stronger and great because of this diversity, Mr. President, not in spite of it.\"\n\n(MORE: Final lineup set for sole night of ABC Democratic primary debate)\n\n\"Our problems didn't start with Donald Trump,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told the crowd at the same debate one night prior, as she articulated her theme of striving for bold reforms. \"Donald Trump is part of a corrupt, rigged system ... We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness. We're going to solve them by being the Democratic party of big structural change.\"\n\n(MORE: Democrats target suburban voters in key battlegrounds ahead of 2020)\n\nFor the first time, the lineup includes polling front-runner Biden sandwiched in between Warren and Vermont Sen.

(Heidi Gutman/Walt Disney Television) More\n\nBut as the former vice president relies on winning back the voters that propelled the first African-American president, Barack Obama, to the White House, liberals Sanders and Warren are running a different kind of race, seeking to forge their own coalition to capture the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nMuch like in 2008, the 2020 contest could see a state-by-state battle for the nomination -- with each caucus and primary bringing a different front-runner and resetting the path to victory.\n\n(MORE: What to watch for in ABC News' Democratic presidential debate)\n\nThe divisions in the candidates' strategies were made clear at the second debates in Detroit, when several Democrats took aim at Obama's presidency -- both directly and indirectly -- and the very legacy Biden is running to extend.\n\nRehashing the Obama legacy\n\nDespite the former president being the party's most popular member, the more liberal flanks and some lower-polling candidates forced Biden to fend off the attacks on his former boss, particularly on health care and immigration.\n\n\"Right now we have a dysfunctional health care system. Eighty-seven million uninsured or underinsured, 500,000 Americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills, 30,000 people dying while the health care industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit,\" said Sanders, who along with Warren spent a large portion of their time vigorously defending Medicare for All.\n\n\"Medicare for All will fix that and that's why I'll fight for it,\" said Warren about the legislation introduced by Sanders and seen by some as a more comprehensive replacement for Obama\u2019s signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The reality is that our plan will bring health care to all Americans under a Medicare for All system,\" said California Sen. Kamala Harris, defending her plan which is more of a hybrid health insurance system that allows private companies to be able to offer health insurance plans within the Medicare system for consumers. \"Your plan by contrast leaves out almost 10 million Americans,\" she said of the Sanders.\n\nOn immigration, although the previous White House took steps to overhaul the immigration system -- even using executive powers to protect Dreamers -- several 2020 Democrats took aim at the three million deportations under the Obama presidency, leaving Biden as the sole navigator of those criticisms.\n\nAt one point, Booker interrupted the elder statesman: \"You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.\"\n\nPHOTO: Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders addresses a Medicare for All town hall campaign event, Aug. 30, 2019, in Florence, S.C. (Meg Kinnard/AP) More\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, too, challenged Biden over Obama-era immigration policies on that stage, without using Obama\u2019s name.\n\n\"Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn't,\" said Castro, who served under Obama. \"My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system because we do have a problem with that.\"\n\nBiden responded by calling out his fellow Democrats for unleashing friendly fire against Obama instead of railing against Trump.\n\n\"To compare him to Donald Trump, I think is absolutely bizarre,\" Biden said at one point during the July debate.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg echoed Biden\u2019s sentiment to reporters in Las Vegas days after the debate, saying, \"[I\u2019m] a little puzzled that when we're all running against President Trump, some folks felt the need to run against President Obama.\"\n\nEven the president saw the last debate as more of a disavowing of Obama than of himself.\n\nAt a rally in Cincinnati following the second round of debates, Trump called out his Democratic rivals for unleashing on his predecessor, telling the crowd, \"The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically.\"\n\nThose who took aim at parts of Obama's record -- either by backing Medicare for All over Obamacare or by rejecting certain aspects of his immigration agenda -- might run into a tougher road ahead as they seek to win back those voters who drifted from Democrats and turned to Trump.\n\n(MORE: ABC News announces details for 3rd Democratic primary debate)\n\nFinding a lane in a still crowded primary\n\nAt this next debate, the contenders outside of the top tier -- standing on the edge of the stage and in need of a breakthrough -- will likely be trained on finding their lane by giving Democratic primary voters more than just a return to the pre-Trump era (like what Warren and Sanders are pitching), without alienating moderates or disapproving of the Obama legacy (which Biden is campaigning on).\n\nFor some in the field hoping to pick up voters that might stray from the 76-year old Biden, that middle ground oftentimes reflects a message of \"generational change,\" \"unity\" and rising above the divisiveness.\n\nButtigieg, who touts a refrain fueled with urgency, said over the weekend in New Hampshire, \"None of us can afford to wait to act on our current problems, because they're becoming a crisis \u2026 It's not enough to think up a good policy. We have to unify Americans around these solutions or nothing will actually get done.\"\n\n\"The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president, but the unification of the people,\" he added.\n\nHarris invokes her prosecutorial past and compelling backstory to appeal to a broad coalition -- often telling voters as she did in the last debate, \"I come from fighters ... My sister Maya and I joke we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults that marched about this thing called 'justice.' And I'm prepared to march with you, to fight with you for the best of who we are, and to successfully prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m going to make sure the American people know about my strong, compelling vision for the future of our country. I believe that I can bring our country together, that we can reunite the old Obama coalition and then take that to the next level,\" Castro, who frequently pushes for a fairer system to even the playing field, said in Beaufort, South Carolina last month.\n\nBooker, who is looking to assemble support by inspiring his audience, told the New Hampshire Democratic Party state convention over the weekend: \"Beating Donald Trump is the floor it is not the ceiling. Beating Donald Trump gets out of the valley, but it does not get us to the mountaintop. I want to go to the mountaintop.\"\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, newly impassioned by a mass shooting in his native El Paso that killed 22 people last month, is on an unvarnished quest to fill the void in moral leadership he sees in the era of Trump.\n\n\"Though we're connected to a president with no values and no morals, we're also connected as a people by our ambitions and aspirations,\" he told reporters over the weekend, later admitting that he might swear on the debate stage. \"Democrats, Republicans, independents, before any of those things, we are Americans first and need to start treating each other like it.\"\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who traded few barbs at the previous two debates while focusing on her roots in the Midwest -- and her ability to work across the aisle -- seeks to restore dignity to the presidency for \"all of America.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be the president for half of America, I want to be the president for all of America,\" she said Saturday after her speech to the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\n\nFor entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who is carving out his own base in the shape of an eclectic cult-like following, the debate stage is an opportunity to attract a wide swath of voters, across the ideological spectrum, as his substantive campaign seeks to make the masses \"think harder.\"\n\nPHOTO: Former Housing the Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro participates in the second of two Democratic presidential primary debates, July 31, 2019, in Detroit. (Paul Sancya/AP) More\n\n\"We automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. If those states sound familiar, those are all the swing states that Donald Trump needed to win and did win. So to me this was a straight automation story that immigrants are being scapegoated for economic problems they have little to nothing to do with ... It's not immigration, it's automation,\" he said in a recent interview with CBS This Morning.\n\n(MORE: Here's how the 3rd 2020 Democratic presidential debate works)\n\nIn store this time around will be opportunities for the contenders to hash out differences that first drew sparks in the earlier rounds and across different stages.\n\nThe main event\n\nBut the main show will be at center stage, where Biden and Warren will face off side-by-side, as she continues to narrow the gap between them in recent polling. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll out this week, the former Harvard professor saw a six-point gain from June.\n\nBiden argued at a campaign stop in Laconia, New Hampshire on Friday that sharing the stage \"will be a good thing\" because he says, \"I\u2019ve never had to break through.\"\n\nWarren, too, appeared to dismiss a potential clash with Biden, telling ABC News it does \"not really\" change her approach.\n\n\"The way I see this is, this is a chance to talk to people all across the country, about how we've got a government that works great for the wealthy and the well connected, just not working for everyone else. And we got a chance to change that in 2020,\" she said.\n\nWhile all eyes seem to be on the moderate vs. progressive showdown between the two, an advisor for Biden suggested that he will be ready to take on Warren\u2019s \"I have a plan for that\" mantra -- saying Biden\u2019s plans were anything but middle of the road.\n\n\"I expect you\u2019ll see Biden echo an important point he made during last week's climate forum: We need more than plans, we need a president who can deliver progress on the most pressing issues facing Americans, which Joe Biden has proven he can throughout his career,\" the official told ABC News.\n\nABC News' John Verhovek and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.", "description": "Democratic debate live updates: Gun control proposals takes center stage originally appeared on abcnews.go.comThe 10 highest-polling candidates will appear for a single night of debate in Houston hosted by ABC News and Univision -- the smallest roster yet in the third matchup of Democratic National Committee-sanctioned", "authors": ["Kendall Karson", "Benjamin Siu", "John Verhovek"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bhslfjnzIVjXBOzAc1q.lQ--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/democratic-debate-09-gty-jc-190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
