In fact, RingCentral reports in a recent survey that 70% of respondents use click-to-call functions from search ads to transact with companies, and that 65% prefer to contact businesses by phone rather than email.\n\nThat\u2019s surely music to the ears of Invoca, a Santa Barbara, California-based provider of AI-powered call tracking and conversational analytics solutions. The company today revealed that it\u2019s raised $56 million in fresh capital on the heels of a $30 million series D round in June 2016, bringing its total financing to date to $116 million. Existing investor Upfront Ventures and new investor H.I.G. Growth Partners co-led the round, which saw participation from other backers including Accel and Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners.\n\nInvestors were no doubt pleased by Invoca\u2019s continued growth \u2014 year-over-year bookings increased 75% year-over-year in the first half of 2019 with a $50 million run rate. Plus, the company has signed heavy-hitting customers like Dish Network, OpenTable, Vivant, AmTrust, Credit.com, Frontier Communications, LendingTree, Genesys, Mayo Clinic, Navistar, SunTrust, Samsung, University Hospitals, and U.S. Bank, which benefit from Invoca\u2019s strategic partnerships with Google, Facebook, Adobe, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n\nCEO Gregg Johnson said the proceeds from this latest round will support the product development and the broadening of its digital advertising, marketing technology, customer relationship management, and affiliate marketing partner ecosystem. \u201cMarketers are investing heavily in Google and Facebook to drive awareness and customer acquisition,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cYet over 90% of commerce still happens offline via contact centers and retail stores \u2026 Brands are struggling to connect digital advertising investments to the human conversations that drive sales. Invoca addresses this gap.\u201d\n\nImage Credit: Invoca\n\nInvoca \u2014 which was founded in 2008 by Colin Kelley, Jason Spievak, and Robert Duva \u2014 develops an eponymous platform that tracks and attributes calls using dynamic phone numbers. It collates online and offline data in a single call profile that it uses to personalize call routing. And, leveraging rule-based call analytics and AI, Invoca classifies and segments conversations while detecting call outcomes such as purchases made, appointments set, or applications submitted.\n\nFor instance, an ecommerce customer might see data from Invoca like whether a caller loaded a shopping cart before they called and their estimated household income. They\u2019d also see the caller\u2019s last-viewed webpages and any keywords and knowledge base articles they searched, as well as the number of times they\u2019d called before. Post-call, the retailer might be notified if the caller mentioned or purchased a product of theirs.\n\nInvoca\u2019s Signal AI, which recently launched, goes a step further by analyzing previous calls and automatically grouping conversations into topics based on speech similarities. It identifies call topics and outcomes (e.g., quote inquiry, claim filing, policy purchasing) to track using a custom-generated predictive model, and it applies the predictive models against live calls and automatically pushes conversions to third-party marketing platforms.\n\nInvoca plays nicely with products like Google Ads to optimize paid search campaigns and Google Analytics to attribute calls and create audiences. Customers using Adobe Experience Cloud and Salesforce Sales Cloud can use the call data it collects for segment creation, or integrate call analytics for closed-loop attribution.\n\nInvoca says that all of its products are both HIPAA and GDPR compliant, and that they offer granular controls for call recording, data redaction, and data access. But it asserts this privacy sensitivity doesn\u2019t come at the expense of robustness \u2014 Invoca claims its platform can handle up to 10-times usage spikes and scale to handle more than 100 million call transactions per year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming into an era where technology is being used to enable and improve human connections, instead of replacing them,\u201d said H.I.G. growth partners managing director Scott Hilleboe. \u201cInvoca is on the forefront of this shift, giving marketers the tools to uncover and act on conversational insights in a way that is simple and scalable, similar to what they\u2019ve been doing on the digital side for years. Given H.I.G.\u2019s extensive investment experience in digital media, analytics, and call centers, we quickly recognized the incredible power and value of Invoca\u2019s technology. We are truly excited to co-lead this round and usher Invoca into its next phase of growth, building on already impressive business momentum and a customer-first culture.\u201d\n\nInvoca has offices in Lone Tree, Colorado and San Francisco in addition to its Santa Barbara headquarters, and its workforce now numbers 230 employees.", "description": "Invoca, which provides business tools that apply AI and analytics to voice calls, has raised $56 million in a funding round.", "authors": ["Kyle Wiggers"], "top_image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/invoca-logo.png?w=1200&strip=all", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
