This year, it\u2019s at 67,\u201d said Saadia Zahidi, head of the WEF\u2019s Center for the New Economy and Society. \u201cThat 10-rank increase is in part because the economy has been able to use the current situation in terms of the trade war to attract some of the investments to be able to become a little bit more of a regional trading hub.\u201d\n\nZahidi said there\u2019s not enough information yet to assess the full impact of tariffs on competitiveness, but that the restrictive trade measures appear to be linked to a \u201cdownturn in business sentiment\u201d that could bode badly for the global economy.", "description": "The United States is less competitive than it was a year ago and the global economy remains hobbled by low productivity despite a decade of cheap money from...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GF336_singap_ZG_20180312225318.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
