(Photo by Emilee Chinn/Getty Images)\n\nThe New York Knicks family has sustained several tragedies in the last few days. According to the New York Post, Dennis Smith Jr.\u2019s stepmother died suddenly on Sunday. On Tuesday, just two days later, it was reported that Reggie Bullock\u2019s sister had also died.\n\nThe team Twitter account sent condolences to Smith and Bullock from Knicks president Steve Mills.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOn behalf of Knicks President, Steve Mills: Our Knicks family is deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Reggie Bullock & Dennis Smith Jr\u2019s close family members. At times like this, we are reminded that life is bigger than basketball. Our thoughts are with them & their families. \u2014 NEW YORK KNICKS (@nyknicks) October 29, 2019\n\nThe Post reported that Smith, 21, had been raised by his stepmother after his biological mother left his family shortly after he was born. Smith missed Monday\u2019s game, and Knicks coach David Fizdale told the Post on Tuesday that Smith would be away from the team indefinitely.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving that up to him right now. He\u2019s got to take care of his family. Obviously we want to get him back as soon as he can. But when you lose somebody like, you\u2019ve got to take care of his family first. Dennis is back home with his family now. Thoughts and prayers are with him right now. We\u2019re going to miss him.\u201d\n\nBullock, 28, is currently rehabbing from back surgery he had in July, so is not in danger of missing any time due to the death of his sister. Bullock lost another family member in 2014, his transgender sister Mia, when she was stabbed to death in Baltimore. The murder remains unsolved, but inspired Bullock to become active in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Knicks are dealing with tragedy after the deaths of two players' family members.", "authors": ["Liz Roscher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1x1AS5yr7lqYpxkSk1h1wA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MDG2O27DHzJ7_0nrKMQQJQ--~B/aD0zNDI2O3c9NTEzOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6d6372f0-fa81-11e9-aa6f-275a3db5cbdf", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
