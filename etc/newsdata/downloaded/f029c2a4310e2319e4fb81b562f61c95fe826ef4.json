It was the 13th boat from Sri Lanka attempting to travel to Australia to seek asylum in the past 18 months.\n\nUnder Canberra's hardline immigration policy, would-be asylum-seekers intercepted at sea while trying to reach Australia are returned to the boat's country of origin.\n\nAsylum-seekers who reach Australia are sent to Australian-run detention camps in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific island of Nauru, where they are held in conditions widely criticized by organizations such as the United Nations.\n\n\"Australia's boarder protection policies remain strong and unchanged and we want Sri Lankans to know the truth about this and encourage the communities to get this message out,\" Furini said.\n\n(Reporting by Ranga Sirilal; writing by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Darren Schuettler)", "description": "NEGOMBO, Sri Lanka (Reuters) - The number of Sri Lankans trying to enter Australia illegally by sea is rising, an Australian general said on Tuesday, a day after Canberra said it had intercepted a 13th boat carrying asylum seekers from the Indian Ocean island.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png"}
