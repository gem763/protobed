Bush administration, who likened American elections to a blowout college party \u2014 and American laws to the cavalier bouncers a boisterous fraternity might employ.\n\n\u201cWe have a great big money party and foreigners are going to want to participate,\u201d Painter continued. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a big party on a college campus but saying students under 21 can\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nDemocrats blame on Trump\u2019s behavior \u2014 like his private ask of Ukraine and public goading of China to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s family \u2014 for why more foreigners feel inclined to be involved in elections, while Republicans continued to defend the president. But people in both parties aisle are troubled by the uptick in foreigners trying to illegally spend their way into American politics.\n\n\u201cThis is something that I believe is an increasing issue,\u201d said one Republican election lawyer, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about issues relating to his work. \u201cWhen we\u2019re dealing with foreign money, pretty much everyone agrees that it\u2019s not allowed. You\u2019re dealing with nefarious actors who are intentionally circumventing the law.\u201d\n\nProbes examining Trump\u2019s fundraising date back to his 2016 campaign, a time when those raising money for the president were hungry for donors to help propel his insurgent bid for office.\n\nFederal prosecutors have been probing whether a pro-Trump super PAC, Rebuilding America Now, and the fund that raised money for Trump\u2019s inauguration accepted donations from American shell contributors serving as conduits for foreign money \u2014 called \u201cstraw donors\u201d \u2014 while Trump associate Tom Barrack was fundraising for the groups. The donations may have come from countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to a report in The New York Times.\n\nAccording to the indictment released Thursday, Parnas and Fruman allegedly created another straw donor, a fake company called Global Energy Producers LLC, that they used to donate to pro-Trump super PAC America First Action and another committee.\n\nThe donations helped Parnas and Fruman \u201cgain access to exclusive political events and gain influence with other politicians,\u201d while they worked to advance their own business goals and that of at least one Ukranian government official they were working on behalf of.\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman (center) in federal court Thursday. | Dana Verkouteren/AP Photo\n\nParnas and Fruman partnered with a powerful Washington ally, Giuliani, with whom they worked on efforts including a push to have the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine removed from her post. The indictment alleges Parnas and Fruman successfully agitated for Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s removal at the behest of a Ukranian official they were working with.\n\nKelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for America First Action, said on Thursday that the super PAC had put the funds into a \u201csegregated bank account\u201d when a complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission in July 2018 about the donation.\n\n\u201cWe take our legal obligations seriously and scrupulously comply with the law and any suggestion otherwise is false,\u201d Sadler said.\n\nThe FBI has also opened an investigation into Yang, who ran a business that promoted access to Trump and his family to Chinese executives, often via Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. Yang and foreign guests have attended political events for Trump, raising questions about how the foreigners paid for tickets and gained access to the events, which are often fundraisers.\n\nIllegal lobbying on behalf of former governments has also ensnared former Trump officials. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an associate, Rick Gates, were indicted after extensive foreign lobbying work and accused of filing false statements in their claims about lobbying for foreign countries, including a pro-Russian party in Ukraine. The indictment claimed Manafort laundered more than $18 million. Former national security advisor Michael Flynn was also convicted of secretly lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government, after Flynn cooperated with prosecutors in the case.\n\nAnd Broidy, a once-shunned GOP fundraiser who made a comeback as a top backer of Trump\u2019s campaign and inauguration, helped promote the interests of Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia to top West Wing officials after Trump became president, but later came under federal investigation for failing to properly register for his work.\n\nThough derided by critics, legal lobbying on behalf of foreign governments and companies has long been a practice in Washington, so long as it\u2019s properly registered and documented. And there have been moments in the past when foreign governments tried to sway U.S. elections, most notably a 1996 scheme in which China donated funds to Bill Clinton\u2019s reelection campaign. Later, foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation drew criticism, despite their legality, from people who said the money would influence Hillary Clinton\u2019s decisions were she to become president.\n\nBut the recent raft of foreign governments trying to illegally influence the U.S. is a \u201chuge departure\u201d from in the past, said Ann Ravel, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we don\u2019t want foreign money in our campaigns is because it takes away from our autonomy as a country. When foreigners feel that with impunity they can give money and not be in any way subject to the laws, then obviously the money is being given for the purpose of influencing policy,\u201d said Ravel. \u201cThat\u2019s why most people give campaign contributions anyway.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6b/ec/988a0ae042ee8d6d01351af41198/191010-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
