REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\n\nMalaysia has said smoke from fires on Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra and Borneo islands over the past month has drifted over the border, forcing it to close schools and issue public health alerts.\n\nIndonesia has dismissed those accusations saying fires have broken out in other countries - and Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar told Reuters some of the fires in Indonesia had been spotted in palm oil plantations owned by at least four subsidiaries of Malaysian companies.\n\nThe plantations had been sealed off after the fires were spotted, she said.\n\nTwo of the Malaysian parent companies said their subsidiary\u2019s plantations had not been sealed off as a result of any fires and they were on high alert for blazes. A third company confirmed a fire in its plantation, while the fourth did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSoutheast Asia has suffered for years from annual bouts of smoke caused by slash-and-burn clearance of forests for farms and palm oil plantations, raising worries about public health and the impact on tourism.\n\nThe minister identified the subsidiaries as Sime Indo Agro, a unit of Sime Darby Plantation; Sukses Karya Sawit, a unit of IOI Corporation; Rafi Kamajaya Abadi, a unit of TDM Berhad; and Riau-based Adei Plantation and Industry, a unit of Kuala Lumpur Kepong Group.\n\n\u201cThese are the total of foreign firms (whose lands) we have sealed,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\n\u2018HIGH ALERT\u2019\n\nKuala Lumpur Kepong confirmed a fire at P.T.

But it said several small fires had been extinguished in recent months.\n\n\u201cSKS has been on high alert and has put in place measures to deal with the dry weather and the risk of fire. We were able to quickly extinguish several small fires that have occurred over the last couple of months and have assisted other companies and villagers to respond to fires on our neighboring lands,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nTDM Berhad, which is owned by the Malaysian state of Terengganu, did not reply to an email and phone call requesting comment.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nSukses Karya Sawit, Rafi Kamajaya Abadi and Adei Plantation and Industry could not be reached for comment.\n\nTeresa Kok, Malaysia\u2019s minister in charge of palm oil, said any report of fires on land controlled by Malaysian companies was a \u201cserious accusation\u201d.\n\nKok said she had contacted the four Malaysian companies and they would cooperate with the authorities to \u201ccorrect this accusation and put matters right quickly\u201d.", "description": "Indonesia's environment minister said on Friday some forest fires in its territory had started on land used by subsidiaries of Malaysian companies, as the neighbors traded blame for blazes that have spread haze across the region.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429456236&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1B5", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
