Part of the accord included Mexico dispatching national guard soldiers to its southern border to help intercept the migrants.\n\nAfter reaching the deal, Trump said his potential new tariffs were \u201cindefinitely suspended,\u201d and he\u2019s regularly praised Mexico\u2019s efforts since. As recently as last week, the president said: \u201cThey\u2019ve done a fantastic job, so we appreciate that very much.\u201d\n\nMigration over the southern U.S. border tends to drop in August due to high summer temperatures. A senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said in July that it wasn\u2019t yet clear what share of the drop from May\u2019s high can be attributed to Mexico\u2019s actions, and how much is seasonal. Morgan said seasonal factors didn\u2019t account for the drop.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Josh Wingrove in Washington at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Joshua Gallu, Justin Blum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The number of people apprehended or turned away at the U.S.-Mexico border fell for the third consecutive month in August as the Trump administration pushes to curb crossings, though numbers remain higher than in recent years.U.S. officials apprehended or denied entrance to roughly 64,000", "authors": ["Josh Wingrove"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2vgD4mtIqn_gVp.3jDmmyg--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/7638c0cc311f50bb3e158fe2f6c142a1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
