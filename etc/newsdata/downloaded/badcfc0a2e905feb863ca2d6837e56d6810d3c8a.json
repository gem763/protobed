The connected app can tell exactly how the cube is configured at any given point, so it can help you learn how to unscramble the cube on your own. And once you\u2019ve learned the finer points of cubing, it can help you improve your skills, as well as track your progress and compete against friends through an online leaderboard.\n\nThere\u2019s also a more advanced version, the GoCube Edge, which offers more accurate tracking (down to 0.001 seconds, versus the 0.25 second accuracy of the regular GoCube), as well as more advanced stats for things like rotation speed and the ability to save stats offline.\n\nThe GoCube is available to back on Kickstarter starting at $59 for early bird pricing, or $79 for the GoCube Edge. Given that a regular, non-Bluetooth equipped cube costs about $5, you\u2019re definitely paying a premium for the extra smarts here. But if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s really, really passionate about your Rubik\u2019s Cube game, it might be worth it. GoCube hopes to ship the first batch of cubes in March 2019, although they are a first-time company, so use your own judgement before you back.", "description": "Kickstarter has once again risen to the challenge of making a smart device out of something that probably didn\u2019t need to be a smart device with the GoCube, a Rubik\u2019s Cube with Bluetooth.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Ars0NC6cmaS-x472TRTGiQuX-U=/17x0:1331x688/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11547641/Screen_Shot_2018_06_15_at_5.23.44_PM.png", "published_at": "2018-06-17"}
