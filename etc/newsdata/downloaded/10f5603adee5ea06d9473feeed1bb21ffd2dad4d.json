Bencic can read Osaka\u2019s game, maybe even read her mind, and has now beaten her three times in their four official matches, with all the victories coming this season.\n\nThe danger could not have been clearer for Osaka, and to Bencic\u2019s credit, she was able to produce the same high-quality performance in their first meeting in a Grand Slam tournament.", "description": "Belinda Bencic beat Osaka, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, for the third time this year.", "authors": ["Christopher Clarey"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/02/sports/02open-promo/02open-promo-facebookJumbo-v6.jpg"}
