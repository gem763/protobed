Congrats, everyone: With Kamala Harris having faded and Boot Edge Edge serving as a trash receptacle for left-wingers\u2019 disposable income, the battle tonight really is down to Grandma versus the two Grandpas.\n\nThe winner is whoever falls asleep last.\n\nLotta moving pieces to this spectacle. Biden remains the prime target for the simple reason that he remains the frontrunner, although at least one poll has Elizabeth Warren pulling into a tie with him and virtually all polls have showed her gaining since the second debate in July. Because only 10 candidates made the cut for this one, everyone\u2019s on the same stage \u2014 which means this is the first time Biden and Warren will face each other. Due to the luck of the draw, they ended up in different groups for the first two debates. She\u2019s going to come hard at him for being a corporatist DINO; he\u2019s going to come hard at her for being a big-spending phony who was happy to court rich donors until recently. In fact, Biden crony Ed Rendell published a splashy op-ed this morning in WaPo previewing that line of attack. Title: \u201cI like Elizabeth Warren. Too bad she\u2019s a hypocrite.\u201d\n\nWarren attacked former vice president Joe Biden for holding a kickoff fundraiser in Philadelphia in April, which she criticized as \u201ca swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors\u201d in an email to supporters the next day. Well, I helped organize that affair, and I thought her attack was extremely hypocritical because nearly 20 of us who attended the Biden fundraiser had also given her $2,000 or more in 2018 at closed-door fundraisers in \u201cswanky\u201d locations. Warren didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble taking our money in 2018, but suddenly we were power brokers and influence peddlers in 2019. The year before, we were wonderful. I co-chaired one of the events for the senator and received a glowing, handwritten thank-you letter from her for my hard work.\n\nRendell told Politico this afternoon that he was getting ripped by the \u201cElizabeth Elites\u201d on Twitter for his piece but added mischievously that the \u201cBernie Bots,\u201d who normally detest him for his centrism, \u201creally liked the column.\u201d That touches on the central mystery tonight: Will Bernie come after Warren for being insufficiently socialist or will their nonaggression pact hold? If he holds his fire and she has a big night, she might bounce out ahead and never look back. If he attacks her, some Warren voters might be enraged and Biden might benefit long-term. No good options.\n\nTeam Biden has had enough of the media trash-talking their guy, meanwhile:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody who has taken as sustained and vitriolic a negative pounding as Biden and who has come through it with the strength he has,\u201d said a top Biden adviser. \u201cSo why isn\u2019t the argument not that he\u2019s a \u2018fragile front runner,\u2019 but instead why is this guy so strong? How is he able to withstand this? Because it is unrelenting. Every story that has been written about Biden for a month has been negative! I would ask Warren and Sanders and these folks: He\u2019s been pummeled for months. For months! So why is he going to fall apart now?\u201d\u2026 They brandish the many predictions of his demise as evidence of their more sophisticated understanding of the Democratic electorate. \u201cHe\u2019s still leading the race nationally. He\u2019s leading in Iowa. It looks like he\u2019s in a dead heat in New Hampshire,\u201d said the top Biden adviser. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the story in New Hampshire isn\u2019t how Bernie Sanders went from sixty to fourteen. And why is it that Biden is beating Warren in Massachusetts? And he\u2019s way ahead in South Carolina. And this is all on the back end of really the most vicious press I think anyone\u2019s experienced. So that to me is a statement of strength. And anyone who\u2019s sitting around waiting for him to fall apart\u2014you know what, it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\n\nI wonder if that top advisor\u2019s name rhymes with \u201cEd Rendell.\u201d The good news for Team Joe is that tonight\u2019s outcome will resolve their dilemma one way or another. If Biden does well in his first debate with the entire top tier onstage together, some of the \u201csoft frontrunner\u201d buzz will quiet down. If he doesn\u2019t do well, it\u2019ll get louder and it\u2019ll seem perfectly justified. It\u2019s not just Warren who\u2019s coming for him either, needless to say. Harris is desperate to use this opportunity to turn her sinking campaign around; her best option to do that remains targeting Biden and trying to pry loose some of his black supporters, who have stayed loyal to him after a brief flirtation with Harris following the first debate. Cory Booker\u2019s going to try the same approach \u2014 this is his moment to elbow past Harris as the most formidable black candidate in the race and make an impression on the South Carolina electorate.\n\nAs for the other five onstage, there isn\u2019t much to say. Beto\u2019s been warned not to curse. Joaquin Castro is running for VP. Klobuchar\u2019s hanging around just in case Biden forgets his own name and centrists need somewhere to run. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign is essentially one long fundraiser now. The only interesting figure in the bottom half of the top tier is Andrew Yang, whose campaign promised yesterday that he\u2019d do something unprecedented onstage tonight \u2014 a tease which he\u2019s been having fun with ever since:\n\nFor those wondering I will be crowdsurfing in sandals at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nTwo words for the debate stage tomorrow night: Gold chain. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nIt seems to me that ninja-style headwear makes everything cooler. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nA likable guy who\u2019ll benefit from the extra attention he\u2019ll receive tonight in a smaller debate crowd. He won\u2019t be the nominee but there\u2019s a nonzero chance that he\u2019ll be in the top four(!) in the next round of polling if he does well this evening. Right now Harris is fourth in the field averaging 6.5 percent, Buttigieg is fifth at 4.8 percent, and Yang is sixth at 3.0 percent. But he actually polled a point better than Buttigieg in a recent Harvard survey and was just one point behind him and Harris in the latest from Reuters. He\u2019s a wild card. I\u2019m rooting for him.\n\nOne more thought about the big three before the debate starts, this time from RCP elections analyst Sean Trende. Every four years people start heavy-breathing about a brokered convention and every four years it doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s not as unlikely this time as it has been in the past, though:\n\nThe modern era of elections, where fundraising is effectively crowdsourced on the Internet and where candidates can reach millions of voters through social media effectively for free, seems to suggest that at some point in the next few cycles we will have a situation where no candidate wins a majority of the delegates. The Democratic Party seems particularly vulnerable to this outcome, since delegates are awarded proportionally (once candidates cross a certain vote threshold). This is unlike the Republican primaries where the final ones are winner-take-all; this is probably the only thing that prevented a brokered convention in 2016 on the Republican side. This Democratic nightmare scenario doesn\u2019t involve six or seven candidates making it to Super Tuesday \u2013 that is unlikely to happen. Instead it involves two or three candidates, and then a factional candidate who continues to draw 15% in the polls in most states and refuses to drop out as two other candidates duke it out. In other words, something like Biden vs. Warren vs. Sanders.\n\nRight, Bernie might hang around to the bitter end even if he\u2019s reliably landing in third place in primary voting, believing that he owes it to progressives to give them a pure socialist option on the ballot. There might even be tactical reasons for him to keep going, as some polls show that more of his supporters prefer Biden to Warren as their second choice and thus Bernie would be aiding the progressive Warren by hoarding those voters himself. Imagine if Biden finishes with the most delegates, Warren finishes second, and Sanders finishes third but with enough delegates that he and Warren together have a majority. Who\u2019s the nominee in that scenario? Biden because he finished ahead or Warren because a majority of delegates are pledged to progressive candidates? (Presumably Bernie would endorse her too.)\n\nThe debate will air live on ABC and online on ABC.com and on the ABC mobile app and on the ABC YouTube account \u2014 which is embedded below, so it\u2019s virtually impossible to avoid this thing.
