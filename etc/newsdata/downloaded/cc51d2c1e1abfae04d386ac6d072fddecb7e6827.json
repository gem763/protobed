These are the very people that the EFF and Shivambu claim to represent,\" said Steenhuisen at the time.\n\n\"Even if Shivambu had declared the money he is alleged to have received for his wedding expenses, the DA maintains that he would still be in breach of the code of conduct, which requires MPs, among other things, to always act in a manner that maintains public confidence and trust in the integrity of Parliament.\n\n\"It also requires that members adhere to values such as integrity, openness and honesty. Shivambu's reported actions clearly betrays the trust of thousands of voters who believed that the EFF cares about them.\"\n\n- Compiled by Jenna Etheridge", "description": "EFF deputy leader Floyd Shivambu was the directing hand behind two companies managed by his brother, using money stolen from the now collapsed VBS Mutual Bank to fund his lifestyle, according to a report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2633/77a260eceac040d191654503f69c1978.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
