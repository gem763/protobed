The Dow DJIA, +1.21% and S&P SPX, +1.09% closed off session highs, but buyers are wary amid a report China wants more talks.\n\nIndeed, our call of the day, suggests last week\u2019s bullish reaction may have been overdone.\n\nMorgan Stanley MS, +2.14% says those who are banking on this trade deal wrapping up are getting ahead of themselves and that the deal with China is an \u201cuncertain\u201d arrangement at best, according to a note from strategists Michael Zezas and Meredith Pickett.\n\n\u201cThere is not yet a viable path to existing tariffs declining, and tariff escalation remains a meaningful risk,\u201d the bank wrote. \u201cThus, we do not yet expect a meaningful rebound in corporate behavior that would drive global growth expectations higher.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, investors seem to be focusing on the silver lining. Trump said Washington will suspend a tariff hike planned this week on $250 billion of Chinese goods, in return for China agreeing to buy as much as $50 billion of American farm goods.\n\nFuture hikes remain in place, though.\n\nFor real progress to be made, Morgan Stanley says it will need to see more progress on issues like enforcement and intellectual-property protections.\n\n\u201cUntil such evidence is available, we must conclude that this pause is more \u2018uncertain\u2019 than \u2018durable,\u2019\u201d the strategists wrote.\n\nThe chart\n\nKevin Muir, strategist at East West Investment Management, calls this illustration from Crescat Capital\u2019s Tavi Costa his \u201cnew favourite chart.\u201d\n\nOutlook for rising prices is at a fresh 40-year low while core & median CPI are at decade highs.\n\n\n\nInflation tends to surprise investors at the top of the business cycle.\n\n\n\nI mostly agree with the deflationary concerns, but is inflation the most underrated risk out there? pic.twitter.com/n8JDfycxOY \u2014 Otavio (Tavi) Costa (@TaviCosta) October 13, 2019\n\n\u201cTavi\u2019s chart illustrates clearly the market is completely complacent about inflation,\u201d Muir wrote on Twitter TWTR, +2.07% . \u201cYeah, I know the deflationists will argue that it will resolve itself with a GFC-type-bust. Maybe, but true financial crises occur when something happens that NO-ONE-BELIEVES-CAN-HAPPEN.\u201d\n\nThe buzz\n\nWhile traders are understandably preoccupied with the trade deal, the third-quarter earnings season kicks off this week with the first reports expected Tuesday from big banks JPMorgan JPM, +1.69% , Goldman Sachs GS, +2.41% and Citibank C, +2.16% , along with fellow Dow components Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.76% and UnitedHealth Group UNH, -0.74% .\n\nAway from the markets, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador caught up in the latest White House controversy, is expected to tell Congress his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what President Trump told him. Stay tuned.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of build-up heading into Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, and with Elizabeth Warren challenging Joe Biden for the front-runner label, the backdrop is significantly different from prior discussions.\n\nThe stat\n\n12.4% \u2014 That\u2019s how much Brown University\u2019s $4.2-billion endowment rallied in fiscal 2019. No other Ivy League school managed to beat the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +1.09% 10.4% over the same time period, Barron\u2019s reported.\n\nThe economy\n\nBanks are closed for Columbus Day, and there are no economic releases on the schedule. Notable reports coming up this week include retail sales figures and September housing starts, due out Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nRandom reads\n\nOversubscribed! The utter failure of cutting the cord.\n\nKen Fisher is paying the price for his inappropriate comments.\n\nAlex Trebek gets real about his situation.\n\nShould we soak the rich? Absolutely!\n\nThis dark video was shown to a bunch of Trump supporters at the president\u2019s Miami resort last week, according to the New York Times.\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
