BeIN Sports paid \u00a3328m for the Middle East rights.\n\nBut Al-Obaidly said piracy \u2013 such as Premier League matches streamed illegally to pubs and online - is set to drastically devalue sports rights unless action is taken.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cOur industry, and rights-holders in particular, are still sleep-walking towards a financial cliff,\u201d he told the Leaders in Sport Summit at Twickenham.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you how the endless growth of sports rights is over - the glorious media rights bubble is about to burst. And while most people here think they\u2019ve got their house in order, the truth is that our industry is completely unprepared.\n\n\u201cA rights holder will tell you we want a lot of market correction in the inflation of these rights if this piracy continues. And basically if you look at Premier League clubs, if you take Watford or Bournemouth, the revenue they get today mostly comes from broadcast revenues.\n\n\"Broadcast revenues thanks to the deal with Sky in Europe is 88 or 90% of their total revenues so if these rights are sold non-exclusively, the broadcasters will not come and just find that amount of money for the same price. Because it's literally non exclusive.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"And that is my response. If we don't do anything about piracy, you will have to have a big big element and the quite a value of reduction in rights.\n\n\"Last year BBC research showed that 50% of fans in the UK had accessed Premier League streams through unofficial providers; and a third of fans didn\u2019t even know it was illegal!\n\n\u201cThese are commercial revenues that are being shop-lifted every day and shop-lifting is seen as acceptable behaviour by consumers.\u201d\n\nBeIN Sports, which has a \u00a312.16bn portfolio of sports rights, has a particular problem with piracy as the channel is banned in Saudi Arabia as part of an economic boycott.\n\nBut the broadcaster's content is widely available through cheap boxes - beoutQ boxes - provided by a Saudi-backed company.", "description": "The Premier League sold its broadcast rights from 2019-22 for a record \u00a39.2billion", "authors": ["Neil Mcleman", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539087.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sheffield-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
