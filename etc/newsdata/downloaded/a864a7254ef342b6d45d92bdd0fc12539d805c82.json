How did this vital fact get left out?\u201d\n\nKelly, meanwhile, replied that there was \u201cno desire to withhold important information from our readers,\u201d pointing out that all of that information was included in their book. She went on to say the point of the essay was about Deborah Ramirez, one of Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers, and her experiences at college in contrast to the future justice\u2019s.\n\nThe reporter further noted that the other allegation was included in the Times piece because it was \u201cgermane\u201d to the conversation, adding that there was an \u201coversight\u201d in the editing process that left out a \u201ckey detail\u201d surrounding the new accusation. From there, McCain wondered why the authors included the woman\u2019s name in the book if she didn\u2019t want it out there.\n\n\u201cHer name is in the book because we think it\u2019s relevant information and we think it\u2019s accurate and we know that her name was provided to members of the Senate and the FBI by a witness named Max Stier, who is a good governance activist in Washington,\u201d Kelly responded. \u201cThis name is in a letter.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the panel took the reporters to task over the editing process of the Times story and why certain information was initially left out, prompting Pogrebin to declare that \u201cwe corrected it and they wrote an editor\u2019s note and they restored it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you realize it because Molly Hemingway made the correction?\u201d McCain retorted, referencing the conservative commentator who called out the Times over the weekend. \u201cI just want to know blankly, you understand why so many people think this is a hatchet job?\u201d\n\nPogrebin answered by defending their book, stating that they wrote it because \u201ceverybody can kind of demonize [Kavanaugh] and everyone can kind of demonize these victims and the reality is somewhere in between, considerably more complicated.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI think this is sort of ground zero for why... the New York Times is nicknamed the \u2018New York Slime\u2019 by many people in conservative circles.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568740092/view_62_vtyscu", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
