In the past few years, the genre has emerged as hip-hop\u2019s new sound \u2013 so prolific that even pop now sounds like trap.\n\nHip-hop as a whole has long had a strong pull over those who engage with it. We sag our jeans even if we aren\u2019t carrying a weapon, we wear high-top sneakers that are overpriced and, more recently, we visit the pharmacy to purchase an inexpensive ingredient for a drink that is known on the streets by many names, most commonly sizzup or lean.\n\nLean is codeine and promethazine, which you can find in common cough syrups and purchase over the counter in most pharmacies. A more accurate description from the Independent Community Pharmacy Association (ICPA) is that it\u2019s a centrally active, low efficacy opioid or narcotic analgesic.\n\nIt is derived from the opium poppy plant and is related to the drug heroin. Since codeine is a member of the opiate drug class, it has similar morphine-like effects on the body, giving users a sense of calm and well-being. Codeine is contained in over-the-counter, schedule 2 medication and is typically found in common medicines used to treat the symptoms of colds and flu, to suppress coughs, and to ease headaches and general pain.\n\nYoung users mix this with a soft drink, the most popular being Sprite. Once the cocktail is mixed, it\u2019s referred to as a Dirty Sprite, or you might hear people say they\u2019re \u201csipping muddy\u201d because the drink mixed with cough or fever syrup gives it a brown tinge.\n\nDrinking sizzup is usually paired with smoking weed, and some users drop in jelly babies so they soak up the chemicals. You then eat them afterwards. On the label of popular codeine-based syrups such as BronCleer (about R37 a bottle) and Stilpane (about R24), there is a warning label that states how these medications can cause sleepiness and drowsiness.\n\nThe idea of lean is to fight the urge to pass out, which gives users a strong high. Users are put under a potent daze in between wakefulness and sleep.\n\nA codeine culture\n\nIt would be simplistic to say that hip-hop is solely to blame for young people\u2019s affinity for codeine. We live in South Africa, the land of few opportunities and great disadvantages. In any township you go to, you\u2019ll find two things: a church and a tavern. Both offer a means to escape the harsh realities of an African life.\n\nAt church, you\u2019re offered prophecy and the idea that things can only get better if you pray hard. The rest of us heathens opt to dull the pain with chemical aids, liquor, or, given that it is so much cheaper, codeine.\n\nNevertheless, the romanticisation by hip-hop of lean cannot be ignored. Users are drawn to it because of the glamour assigned to this drug by rappers looking to emulate the blueprint laid down by the likes of Weezy [Lil Wayne] and Future.\n\nThe idea of feeling \u201cwavy\u201d stems from the euphoric and lackadaisical high the drug brings. Many people\u2019s first recollection of someone sipping muddy is US rapper Lil Wayne \u2013 due to years of codeine abuse, his vocals fragmented. Back when he was pretty much the best commercial rapper alive, he even paid a guy to hold his double cup of lean as he went about his day.\n\nIn 2015, trap music received arguably one of the most pivotal records from Atlanta-based trapper Future. His Dirty Sprite 2 album changed the way this genre was crafted through his production team of Metro Boomin and Southside.\n\nThe contents of Dirty Sprite 2 painted a dark story of a man consumed by his lust for women, and who numbs the pain of heartache and the traumas that come with selling drugs in \u201ca whole lot of dirty soda\u201d and prescription drugs like Xanax.\n\nTrap has pollinated other avenues of music. On his 2016 Malibu album, Anderson Paak sings: \u201cVolume 1 was too freaky for you frail niggas/ so I got lean like codeine and pills.\u201d\n\nAs with most pop culture trends, US rappers\u2019 profanity for singing about codeine has filtered across to our shores. In 2014, one of the hardest local duos came into the light. Sjava and Saudi gave us the street classic Vura over a DJ Citi Lyts production. In the second verse, Saudi kicks a scheme about taking an envelope to Baba Nxumalo. After a brief tangent, he says: \u201cOkay back to the story I showed them the funds/ we poured up the lean Bese sayenz\u2019 Iplan/ Pulled up on Andile he was the one that showed me thezidakamizwa [the drugs].\u201d\n\nOn the heater Plug, which means drug dealer, Emtee spits: \u201cI\u2019m drippin/ I\u2019m sippin/ I show love to the streets.\u201d\n\nLean Team is a group of local rappers whose entire approach is based on the drink. Their front runner, Flame, prior to the rift at the Wrecking Crew, threw a few darts on a Zooci Coke Dope record, Sweet Revenge: \u201cRolling, I\u2019m rolling/ I\u2019m rolling mixing soda/ Pour it, I\u2019m going in/ I\u2019m going in till it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nAmbitiouz Records wouldn\u2019t let Saudi or Sjava speak to us about their affinity for the drink. This scheme is probably a story of Saudi\u2019s reality, and he rhymes about it proficiently and proudly, even if he may be unaware of how his verse could be interpreted or how aspects of it are being copied.\n\nLean Team spit their raps with their chests puffed all the way out, but ran for the hills when we asked them for a simple, judgement-free conversation about lean.\n\nLocally, Emtee has become somewhat of a poster boy for lean. In fact, the brother apparently doesn\u2019t drink alcohol and I\u2019d guess his proclivity for the sweet tonic was behind the social media slip-up on Instagram Live last year when he accidentally revealed his penis.\n\nBut he recently told City Press that he no longer drank this highly addictive beverage, which has become as synonymous with hip-hop as Nuvo champagne in 2009 and Cristal throughout the 1990s.\n\nCodeine use\n\nCodeine is now the most purchased over-the-counter drug in South Africa, with figures around usage estimated at 600 000, according to the ICPA. According to Vice, the numbers are even higher in Zimbabwe, where people drink the syrup neat.\n\nStavros Nicolaou is Aspen\u2019s senior executive for strategic trade development. Aspen produces Stilpane, a fever syrup for children that\u2019s a popular choice for lean mix. He says there are plans to replace codeine in Stilpane.\n\n\u201cWe are presently in discussions with the regulator as to what role it can play to use alternative analgesics. This, to a large degree, depends on SA Health Products Regulatory Authority [SAHPRA] expeditiously approving these alternative analgesic products,\u201d Nicolaou says.\n\nHe spoke to us about the need for pharmacies to follow certain procedures when selling these products.\n\n\u201cSuch professional care includes keeping a register of purchases of scheduled products made by consumers.\"\n\n\u201cWhile many pharmacy chains and independent pharmacists have ensured the proper implementation of the relevant legislation, others have failed to do this. There are bodies that monitor and police this kind of activity, and non-compliance with the relevant regulations can be reported to these,\u201d he says.\n\nAny good pharmacy will also have a notice at the dispensary that says products containing codeine are limited to 40 tablets or 100ml per transaction.\n\nA local pharmacist explains that the issue is that the database at his pharmacy may differ to that of another, and so a person may cap their limit at his and then simply head to another pharmacy and procure more.\n\nHe says making these medicines a higher scheduled drug might be the answer.\n\nKavitha Singh, speaking on behalf of Adcock Ingram, which produces another highly favoured codeine syrup, BronCleer, says that creating a centralised database that shows codeine purchases would be more effective than upping the schedule.\n\n\u201cWe support the responsible use of medicines and are not convinced that up-scheduling this product or other products containing codeine will mitigate illicit use and distribution.\n\n\u201cScheduling is related to a product\u2019s safety profile and therapeutic indications. We do believe that a centralised database for patients should be established and government should advise if the custodian should be the SAHPRA or the SA Pharmacy Council,\u201d she says.\n\nAs mentioned before, there are a few steps in place to curb codeine abuse.\n\nSingh gives us a brief breakdown: \u201cAdcock Ingram has internal controls in place to identify and block customers from purchasing abnormal volumes of products containing codeine, and works closely with the SAHPRA on this through regular engagement on the subject.\u201d\n\nShe says that schedule 2 medicines may only be sold under personal supervision of a pharmacist and may not be kept in an open shop. Every sale of a schedule 2 medicine must be recorded in a prescription book, thus ensuring the pharmacy has details of patients to whom the medicines are sold.\n\nSchedule 2 medicines are not to be sold to anyone younger than 12, unless there is a prescription issued by a registered medical practitioner.\n\nShe adds: \u201cFurthermore, the Medicine Act has scheduling regulations, which are used to \u2018schedule\u2019 a medicine when registered with the SAHPRA. In these regulations, products containing codeine are allowed to be sold as schedule 2 medicines in the permissible quantities.\u201d\n\nBronCleer syrup with codeine is sold in 100ml bottles. When more than 100ml is sold, it is no longer considered a schedule 2 medicine and the higher volume may not be sold without a prescription.\n\n\u201cThis, in effect, implies that a pharmacy may not sell more than one bottle of 100ml BronCleer with codeine to a patient without a valid prescription,\u201d Singh says.\n\nEasy to buy?\n\nI decided to head into the streets and see how easy lean is to buy. Ready with a story about my boss requiring cough syrup for her sick six-year-old, I head to the big commercial pharmacies first, Clicks and Dis-Chem. The woman at the Dis-Chem at Campus Square in Auckland Park lists all the paracetamol-based syrups I should try.\n\n\n\nWhen I mention Stilpane, she says that it would not work well for a child who had the symptoms I faked. I try to push for it, but she stares at me blankly. I am forced to leave. I try the same thing at Clicks. The pharmacist at first buys my story and then suggests a slightly more expensive codeine-based syrup. I dash to the car to get more money and, when I return, a different man says: \u201cOh, I see, you just want the codeine.\u201d\n\nYes, I do. \u201cListen my guy, I\u2019m personally not going to sell this to you because I care about you. I\u2019ve seen too many of my homies go down this road and I can\u2019t have a hand in this. Sorry, bra,\u201d he says.\n\nHe projects well, so the people in line hear him and they \u201cmmmhmm\u201d in agreement as I stand there feeling like a junkie. Given that both pharmacies are in Campus Square, a mall frequented by students, it is unsurprising that the staff are vigilant about selling codeine.\n\nThe next day, I head to an independent pharmacy east of Johannesburg. After a short wait in line, I walk up and ask if I can get two bottles of Stilpane.\n\nThe woman at the counter, who didn\u2019t look like a pharmacist says: \u201cSure, if you want to kill yourself.\u201d\n\nDespite her words of warning, she still takes my cash and hands me 200ml of lean.\n\nThe damage?\n\nAccording to the SA Pharmacy Council, in addition to disrupting an addict\u2019s social and work life, codeine addiction can result in seizures, liver and kidney damage, depression, anxiety and even death.\n\nGeneral practitioner Dr Hassim explains what this cocktail does to the mind: \u201cKids will perhaps be prescribed this after an operation and continue to use it once they feel the euphoric effects of it.\n\n\u201cIt does cause this, along with listlessness, apathy, drowsiness and a relaxing feeling. Especially when it is combined with alcohol or other opioids.\u201d\n\nShe says abuse of the drug can lead to breathing problems that manifest when a person overdoses, which can lead to a coma in some cases.\n\n\u201cThe signs to look out for are unusual sleep patterns, confusion and difficulty breathing.\u201d\n\nSome users note a discolouration of their fingernails and, given the sweetness of this drink, tooth decay is not uncommon.\n\nThis epidemic has claimed talent in South Africa and abroad. US rapper Mac Miller may very well have been drinking lean on the day he died.\n\nSome view lean as a gateway to prescription drugs such as Xanax and Percocet. These are incredibly strong pharmaceuticals used to treat anxiety and pain, but, truth be told, getting a prescription for them is laughably easy. Some users take these in conjunction with dirty soda, creating a terribly dangerous concoction. Top graffiti artist Ronske from Cape Town overdosed on it late last year.\n\nWe spoke to legendary deejay and producer Grand Master Ready D about the proliferation of lean in the Cape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly disturbing. Unfortunately, in this instance, hip-hop does start to get the blame. There are Americans who have glorified the use of these substances \u2013 either through interviews they do or through their music videos.\u201d\n\nBut, he says the idea of substance abuse finding its way into music is not unique to hip-hop.\n\n\u201cI love trap music from a production standpoint. I know artists speak about what they experience on a daily basis through the music, but you will also get those who glorify the negatives. So as far as the messaging goes, I don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d\n\nReady D first heard about it eight or 10 years ago and didn\u2019t really pay attention to it. He\u2019s been drug-free his whole career, and he doesn\u2019t adhere to the notion that there is a link between narcotics or substance abuse and creativity.\n\n\u201cUsing drugs puts a damper on the culture and people get painted with the same brush if you say you\u2019re a hip-hop artist or practitioner. And the culture does get pointed at. Hip-hop seems to be the scapegoat for a lot of society\u2019s issues.\u201d\n\nRashid Kay, the brains behind the SA Hip-Hop Awards, explains how lean was around even before the trap era took a firm hold of the culture: \u201cIt became popular during the Crunk era, when it was called \u2018sizzup\u2019 [syrup]. Only the name \u2018lean\u2019 or \u2018purp\u2019 became popular during the trap era, but it was already there.\u201d\n\nKay is ambivalent about the notion of hip-hop being blamed for this epidemic. He traces the origins of this drink and when it first infiltrated the culture.\n\n\u201cIn the US, Pimp C died from codeine. Lil Wayne had multiple seizures. ODB [Wu Tang], Mac Miller and a few others died from drug overdoses. Locally, HHP [Jabulani Tsambo] had a narcotic situation that might have propelled him to suicide.\n\n\u201cWe all saw Emtee falling off the stage, and he\u2019s an open lean user. It\u2019s not only a talent loss to fans, but to their families as well. Most of these artists had young kids when they passed on. These kids were denied an opportunity to make their parents proud. The dearly departed won\u2019t get to see their kids graduate or achieve amazing things. One late artist may have employed 10 or more people, meaning 10 or more families have lost their livelihood.\u201d\n\n.
