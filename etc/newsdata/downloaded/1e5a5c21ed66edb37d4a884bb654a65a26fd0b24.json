Walker said after the game he was just trying to go for the ball and described the call as \u201cawful\u201d \u2013 a word he would use multiple times to describe the officiating.\n\nNEW YORK GIANTS' DANIEL JONES RECALLS TOM BRADY-LED PATRIOTS SPOILING HIS SUPER BOWL FUN\n\n\u201cAwful. It was an awful call,\u201d he said, according to ESPN. \u201cI felt like I went for the ball and [it] just so happened we collided, but I was looking for the ball. It was an awful call by them. It is what it is, though.\u201d\n\nReferee Clete Blakeman explained in the pool report that regardless of intent Walker\u2019s helmet-to-helmet contact will always draw a penalty.\n\nNEW YORK GIANTS' KAREEM MARTIN DELIVERS SUPER BOWL TICKETS TO VOLUNTEER FOOTBALL COACH WITH DOWN SYNDROME\n\nWalker, a second-year safety, expressed his frustrations to reporters with the referees after the Lions\u2019 23-22 loss to the Packers.\n\n\u201cExtremely pissed off right now,\u201d Walker said. \"It is what it is. Disappointed. Hurt. We had that game. I'm going to say the same s\u2014t. We should have won it. It is what it is, though. Got to bounce back.\"\n\nHe added that even though there were some \u201cawful calls\u201d he knows the team had to play through it.\n\nWalker was asked if he cared whether he gets fined for his comments, he said he didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDetroit vs. Everybody,\u201d Walker said, according to the Detroit Free Press. \u201cI\u2019m saying it. Detroit vs. Everybody. It\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\nDetroit defensive end Trey Flowers also had trouble with the officiating as he was flagged twice for illegal use of hands. According to ESPN, he explained exactly what he was doing.\n\nJACKSONVILLE JAGUARS' GEOFF SWAIM RECEIVES BRUTAL HIT FROM NEW ORLEANS SAINTS' DEMARIO DAVIS\n\n\u201cI actually changed the position of my hand, because it was to the chest initially,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cWhich is right here. I was doing it all game. I didn't know that was a flag to the chest, so I could change it to [motioning somewhere else on his chest]. They called it again.\u201d\n\nWalker and Flowers\u2019 frustrations were echoed by Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders.\n\n\u201cThat is sickening... the @NFL needs to look at a way to prevent that from happening. Two phantom hands to the face calls really hurts us tonight. Yes, we could have scored TDs, but @Lions played too well to have the game end this way,\u201d Sanders wrote in a tweet.\n\nDetroit was called for eight penalties for 50 yards. The Packers were also flagged six times for 48 yards.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cWe all know we can\u2019t have those penalties, whatever it was that caused those to take place,\u201d Lions coach Matt Patricia said, according to the Detroit Free Press. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back and take a look at it and make sure we\u2019re coaching it better, make sure we\u2019re doing the right things. Just can\u2019t have them. We know how dangerous Aaron Rodgers is and how detrimental those penalties are.\u201d", "description": "Criticism of NFL referees overshadowed Monday night\u2019s game between the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions as players and even one Hall of Famer chimed in on the officiating.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
