We came here on the back foot, but we pulled through.\"\n\nAfter winning his last two titles in Mexico without even finishing on the podium, it was ironic for Hamilton to win but know he has to wait for a sixth coronation.\n\nBottas, who survived a heavy crash in qualifying on Saturday, said: \"Considering what happened yesterday, it's a good result... I don't think we could have done much more.\"\n\nHamilton added: \"I don't mind not winning the title here. I can wait. I just love racing and I am happy to take each race as it comes.\"\n\nFour-time champion Vettel said: \"It was a long race with no break, but I think Lewis was just cruising for most of his second stint. I'm happy, but we could have had a sharper strategy.\"\n\nThe race began in warm and dry conditions, Leclerc making a clean getaway from his seventh pole, ahead of Vettel, as Ferrari enjoyed their 65th front row lockout, gifted by Verstappen's qualifying penalty.\n\nThe Dutchman, angered by his Saturday demotion from pole for ignoring yellow flags when Bottas crashed, made an aggressive start and, as Hamilton recovered from being squeezed off-track by Vettel, banged wheels with him at Turn Two.\n\nBoth drivers had to regain control and, after another off-circuit excursion, re-joined down in fifth and eighth respectively. Their misfortune was a gain for Albon and Sainz who took third and fourth before Hamilton split them when he passed the Spaniard on lap four.\n\n'TYRES ARE DEAD'\n\nBy then, the first Virtual Safety Car (VSC) intervention, to clear debris, had been completed to be followed by another burst of 'mad Max' fury when he lunged into Bottas and picked up a puncture.\n\nThis led to his right rear tyre falling off the wheel -- and a pit-stop that left him to re-join 20th and last having switched from mediums to hards.\n\nAt the front, Leclerc pulled 2.3 seconds clear of Vettel by lap 15 before pitting, Ferrari responding to Red Bull's decision one lap earlier to bring in Albon for new mediums. The Monegasque, thus committed to a two-stop strategy, re-joined fourth, behind Vettel, Hamilton and Bottas.\n\nIn a flux of varying strategies, Hamilton fought rear tyre-wear to stay close to Vettel, with Bottas 7.2 seconds adrift in third by lap 24 before the champion pitted for a set of hard compound tyres.\n\nOver 10 laps later Bottas pitted to be followed by Vettel, Leclerc regaining the lead ahead of Hamilton, but facing a second stop.\n\n\"My front tyres are dead,\" complained Leclerc, shortly before a slow second stop on lap 44 in 6.2 seconds.\n\nHe came out fifth, rising to fourth when Albon pitted in 2.5 while Hamilton led the race, all the front-runners on hard tyres of varying ages as they approached the final laps.\n\nLess than six seconds separated the top four with 14 laps to go with Vettel, Bottas and Leclerc in hot pursuit of Hamilton. A dramatic finish, governed by tyre wear, was in prospect.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Life & Culture - [MEXICO CITY] Lewis Hamilton drove to a near-flawless victory, but not yet a sixth drivers' world championship on Sunday when he claimed his 10th win of the season for Mercedes at the Mexican Grand Prix. .
