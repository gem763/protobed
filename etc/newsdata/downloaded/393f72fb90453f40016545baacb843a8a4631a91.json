And though the $8 billion valuation fell well short of speculations of $100 billion, Uber is still one of the biggest names on the market today.\n\nWith such eye-popping numbers, it\u2019s difficult to remember a time when the 10-year-old company wasn\u2019t the juggernaut it is today. Uber currently has more than 2 million drivers ferrying passengers in more than 63 countries.\n\nBut back in August 2008, founder Garrett Camp was laying out his dream of a \u201cnext-generation car service\u201d in a slideshow on his computer. Little did he know that dream would grow exponentially into a company that now handles grocery delivery, that has a rapidly growing on-demand food delivery segment in Uber Eats, and is developing a fleet of self-driving taxis.\n\nAs part of our coverage of the genesis of today\u2019s successful companies, BI Prime took a look at how Camp envisioned Uber (then UberCab) 10 years ago in his original pitch deck:\n\nThe core concept was largely the same: a fast and efficient on-demand car service that he described as the \u201cNetJets of car services\u201d\n\nUber originally wanted to screen its customers by only picking up members and banning hailing from the street\n\nAll of Uber\u2019s projected use cases, from airport pickup/dropoff to travel to and from restaurants, still hold up today\n\nSome of what Camp laid out in the pitch deck no longer holds up, such as a few of Uber\u2019s projected eco-friendly benefits and the makeup of Uber\u2019s fleet of cars.\n\nThe rest of the deck outlines some key points such as:\n\nPlans for surge pricing\n\nThe company\u2019s project valuation\n\nPotential outcomes for the company, including a best-case scenario\n\nFuture optimizations\n\nMarketing ideas\n\nAnd more\n\nBI Prime is publishing dozens of stories like this each and every day, chock full of exclusive content and industry analysis.
