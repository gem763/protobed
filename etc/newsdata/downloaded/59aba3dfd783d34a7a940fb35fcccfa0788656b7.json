I\u2019m so excited.\u2019\n\nTaylor surprised Shaun\u2026 (Picture: BBC)\n\nMeeting up with Taylor backstage, the ecstatic Olivia gave Taylor a fair bit of warning of just how much her being there would mean to Shaun.\n\n\u2018He doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re coming and he might wee,\u2019 Olivia said, with an unfazed Taylor replying: \u2018We can do cleanups, this is taped.\u2019\n\n\u2026Thanks to his Broadchurch co-star Olivia (Picture: BBC)\n\nNaturally surprising Shaun, the duo reunited, with Taylor confessing: \u2018I\u2019m a big Broadchurch fan, by the way. Massive.\u2019\n\nThis is what dating a British guy does to you\u2026\n\nThe actress\u2019s comment prompted incredulous laughter (can you blame him?) from Shaun, who played villain Ricky Gillespie in the second series, reassuring Taylor: \u2018I\u2019m not as nasty in real life.\u2019\n\nWell, there\u2019s a crossover we didn\u2019t ever really expect to see.\n\nEarlier on in the episode, Olivia put in another celebrity favour, roping in her Fleabag co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge to help her on her own track.\n\n\u2018Olivia Colman has just sent two texts and got Taylor Swift and Phoebe Waller-Bridge to rock up. The clowns I hang out with can\u2019t even reply the same day,\u2019 one fan joked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlivia\u2019s power is truly unbeatable.\n\nChildren In Need: Got It Covered is available to purchase on Friday 1 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
