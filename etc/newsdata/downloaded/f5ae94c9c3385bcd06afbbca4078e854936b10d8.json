Yesterday, Dataracer highlighted a tweet by a comics editor named Heather Antos. To be clear, I\u2019m not interested in criticizing Antos so much as pointing to her as an example of what seems like a much broader trend on Twitter.\n\nAs you can see, Antos hasn\u2019t written much herself about this tweet. She\u2019s boosting a claim made by someone named Rachel Miller who has a problem with the forthcoming Joker movie. Specifically, Miller doesn\u2019t like the idea of making the Joker sympathetic and doesn\u2019t want to be around \u201cany of the lonely white boys who relate to it.\u201d\n\nWhy the Joker movie is problematic. Rachel Miller nails it. pic.twitter.com/vTHlVOBHCY \u2014 Heather Antos (@HeatherAntos) September 5, 2019\n\nAs you can see, tens of thousands of people have agreed with Miller and Antos about this. In case it wasn\u2019t clear how Antos herself feels, she also added this reference to Aurora shooter James Holmes:\n\nIt was not that long ago when a socially isolated disgruntled white man who felt \"wronged\" by society quite literally dressed up as the Joker and shot up a movie theater in Colorado. \u2014 Heather Antos (@HeatherAntos) September 6, 2019\n\nSo far there\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about this. Lots of people have been criticizing the new Joker movie (which they haven\u2019t seen) on similar grounds. What is odd Antos doing so is that she works in the comics industry. And can you guess who one of her favorite characters is? If you guessed Joker, you guessed right. Just a few years ago she was posting Joker memes:\n\nAnd talking about her joker keychain:\n\nMy keys are now complete! Thanks @DCComics for creating this lovely little Voodoo #Joker key chain!!! #batman pic.twitter.com/xKwrhulwWk \u2014 Heather Antos (@HeatherAntos) September 8, 2013\n\nAnd saying she had an obsession with the Joker:\n\n@TheOtherMarioC I second that\u2026.except, a 5'10\" Blonde with an odd obsession with the Joker\u2026. \u2014 Heather Antos (@HeatherAntos) July 23, 2014\n\nAnd of course, drawing the Joker:\n\nThere more, but you get the point. Joker was one of her favorite characters as recently as 2014. By 2016 she was beginning to express some reservations about the character from the perspective of an abusive relationship survivor:\n\nAs someone who has survived an abusive relationship, seeing all of these \"I'd be Harley Quinn to the Joker any day\" posts make me sick. \u2014 Heather Antos (@HeatherAntos) August 7, 2016\n\nAnd now three years later DC is putting out a Joker movie with a top actor and Antos thinks it\u2019s just too problematic. She got woke.\n\nI think you can argue that some of this seems to happen to people as they grow older. Remember when George Lucas decided that Greedo should shoot first so Han Solo wasn\u2019t problematic? Remember when Steven Spielberg digitally replaced the shotguns in ET with walkie talkies?\n\nRemember when Spielberg replaced the guns in ET with walkie-talkies? Maniac. pic.twitter.com/cafofF874G \u2014 Dave Brain \ud83e\udde0 (@Ornsack) January 1, 2017\n\nSo some of this seems to happen as we get older, but I think there\u2019s an argument to be made that Twitter changes people by rewarding them for preaching the party line. I mean, that tweet up top has 52k likes! That\u2019s a football stadium full of people who are reinforcing that this was the right thing to say. No one was doing that back when Heather Antos was talking about loving the Joker. Back then she was lucky to get 5 likes.\n\nThe saying \u201cGet woke, go broke\u201d may be true for large corporations with a lot to lose, but for regular people on Twitter the opposite is true. This clip by Jeremy at the Quartering makes the point that Twitter seems designed to reinforce exactly this kind of group-think. Any tendency toward wokeness gets rewarded, so over time people who enjoy the social media likes tend to preach to the choir. There\u2019s not much social media success to be had in being a woman who likes the Joker. But there\u2019s social media gold to be mined in being a woman who finds the Joker problematic.", "description": "Why so serious?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-Joker.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
