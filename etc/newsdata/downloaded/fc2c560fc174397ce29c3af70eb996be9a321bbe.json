Miller, who challenged the government over Article 50 in 2016, is appealing the decision of London\u2019s High Court, which dismissed claims that the suspension of parliament was unlawful.\n\nThe government is also appealing a decision made last week by Scotland\u2019s highest court. The Scotish courts, which apply a different legal system to the rest of the U.K., ruled the prorogation of parliament to be unlawful.\n\nThe Scottish Court of Session found that Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament for almost five weeks stymied debate ahead of Brexit.\n\nParliament was suspended last week and will not sit again until the Queen\u2019s Speech on 14 Oct., leaving little time for parliament to agree on a new deal with the European Union before its scheduled departure on 31 Oct.\n\nIn the event parliamentary suspension is deemed unlawful, parliament may be recalled with immediate effect with or without the Queen's Speech. If Johnson is found to have misled the Queen when he sought approval for prorogation, he could be made to resign.\n\nBefore its suspension, MPs passed a bill to compel the Prime Minister to request a Brexit extension from the EU in the event it had not reached an exit agreement.\n\nJohnson has previously stated that the U.K. will leave the European Union on its Halloween exit date \u2018do or die\u2019.\n\nThe pound was lower as the court proceedings began. At 09:50 GMT, fell 0.34% to 1.2399.\n\nWatch live as the Supreme Court hears claims suspension of parliament is unlawful.\n\nWatch Live: U.K. Supreme Court Hears Appeals on Prorogation of Parliament", "description": "Watch Live: U.K. Supreme Court Hears Appeals on Prorogation of Parliament", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC4I15Y_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
