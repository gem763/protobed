If the Democrats wanted to help the American people in these areas, they would have held hearings on these matters, drafted bills and negotiated with the White House and Republicans. But they haven\u2019t. In contrast to their slowness in pursuing beneficial legislation, however, the Democrats are so focused on impeachment that, even though Congress is in recess, the Democrats are staying in Washington and holding hearings on impeachment-related matters. Democrats hardly ever work in Washington during a recess, even when the government is facing a shutdown.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 action and work ethic on impeachment shows their ability to focus and work hard on matters they find important. Unfortunately, it also demonstrates that passing legislation which benefits the American people does not rank high on the Democrats\u2019 priority list.\n\nMICHAEL B.
