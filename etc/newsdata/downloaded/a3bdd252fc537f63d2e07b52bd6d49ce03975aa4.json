Koke, whistled by his own fans on Tuesday, improved and there was a clean sheet for an unfamiliar back four, in the absence of injured duo Stefan Savic and Jose Gimenez.\n\nBilbao, who slip to 10th, were disappointing and have now lost three of their last five games, drawing the other two.\n\nYet they might have been ahead in the opening two minutes had Jan Oblak not dived to his right and brilliantly clawed Inigo Martinez\u2019s header away from the top corner.\n\nAtletico took the lead in the 28th minute and Correa provided it, his wiggling run through three Bilbao defenders ending with a poked pass to the arriving Saul, who made no mistake.\n\nKieran Trippier did well to block a stinging shot from Raul Garcia and he was involved in his side\u2019s second shortly after the hour.\n\nHe collected the ball on the right from Thomas Partey\u2019s pass and set the ball back for Koke. Bilbao expected the cross but instead Koke slid a ball inside for Correa, who drove the ball to the back post where Morata could not miss.\n\nMuniain went close late on with an acrobatic volley after Inaki Williams\u2019 header found him free but his shot found the side-netting and any hopes of a comeback were dashed.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Diego Simeone\u2019s decision to leave out Diego Costa was vindicated on Saturday as Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/31bd48_alvaro-morata-scored-atletico-madrid-goal-in-win-athletic-bilbao-on-saturday-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
