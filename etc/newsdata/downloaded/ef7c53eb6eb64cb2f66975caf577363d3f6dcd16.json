It will be incredibly sad to see him go. It would be nice if we could give ourselves another fortnight in Japan for him.'\n\nJosh Navidi, who owes his resurgent career to Gatland having been left in the cold between his first and second caps in 2013 and 2017, echoed Jenkins' sentiments.\n\n'We want him to finish on a positive and give him the send-off he deserves,' said the back-rower.\n\n'It speaks for itself, with the three Grand Slams and all the campaigns he's been part of and what we've achieved as a nation.\n\n'He's been there and done it so it gives us confidence. We know he can push us through the week and make sure we're ready.'\n\nNeil Jenkins described Gatland as 'an incredible rugby coach and incredible person'\n\nJosh Navidi wants to give a fitting send off, with Gatland heading back to New Zealand\n\nWales are set to bring back their big guns for Sunday's game. Sportsmail understands Dan Biggar, Jonathan Davies, George North and Hadleigh Parkes will start in the backs, despite the latter missing Wednesday afternoon's training session in Beppu.\n\nKen Owens explained why he thinks this highly experienced Wales side are so formidable under Gatland. 'It is the confidence we have got in each other,' said the 70-cap hooker.\n\n'Everybody is pretty comfortable with their role in the squad, on and off the field.\n\n'We've had good continuity in the squad over the last two years, which helps galvanise us. There is experience right across the squad in big games. Liam Williams has been successful in England, a lot of players have played in big games for their clubs.\n\nKen Owens thinks the big-game experience has helped Wales develop as a side\n\n'The more you play in the big games, the more you get used to them; the build-up, what is expected and how to deliver. The management prepare us well and there is no stone left unturned.'\n\nJenkins described Gatland's ability to keep his head when all about him are losing theirs.\n\n'It's probably us he has to calm down, the rest of the coaching staff,' he said. 'He's been here for 11 years and whatever he does, everyone looks up to him. Gats is an incredibly smart rugby man.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN BEPPU: The Wales players have one simple message as they target victory over France in the World Cup quarter-final on Sunday: Win it for Warren.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19806464-0-image-a-15_1571258573953.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
