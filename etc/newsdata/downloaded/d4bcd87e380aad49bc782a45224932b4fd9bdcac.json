Swanson estimates that she saves about $8,000 a year.\n\nShe said, \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes along the way but going from two incomes to one income and having a baby, which is very expensive, I knew I had to do something to save money.\u201d\n\nSix years later, she\u2019s still couponing.\n\n\u201cMy favorite thing about couponing is definitely that shopping high,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cBeing able to walk out of the store with stuff for free or even being paid to take it. That amazing feeling just doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\nAs for TikTok, sharing her knowledge about saving money began as a complete accident.\n\n\u201cI never joined it for couponing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until someone asked what my username is and I showed a quick 15-second video of my stockpile and it got 3 million views and I think it kind of blew up from there.\u201d\n\nSince then, Swanson has been known as \u201cCoupon Katie\u201d and her TikTok channel has garnered over 600,000 fans and thousands of video likes. She also shares her tips on YouTube under the same name.\n\nThe mother of two keeps it light by using humor and informative clips that show people how to score big savings on things like make-up and household items or showing off her latest couponing haul at the store.\n\n\u201cI think couponing works so well for TikTok because a lot of deals are time-sensitive, they come and go and TikTok allows users to create videos in a very fast way,\u201d said Glum.\n\n\u201cI do think I\u2019ve put a spin on couponing,\u201d said Swanson. \u201cIt\u2019s attracting more young people into the couponing world... Couponing is not dorky. It\u2019s not lame. It\u2019s something interesting and neat and different.\u201d\n\nHere are some of Swanson's tips for successful couponing:\n\n1. Don't overwhelm yourself\n\nFor those that want to start couponing, Swanson said to take baby steps and to take one deal at a time. She said, \"You might see some of my stockpiles, my hauls, and I'm grabbing a cart full of stuff, and you want to do that too, that\u2019s what I made a mistake with when I started couponing is that I got a cart full of stuff and I didn't know what I was doing and I screwed up and I was about to quit.\"\n\n2. It's not a competition\n\nMany may want to purchase everything in sight when it comes to couponing, but Swanson said that it's not a competition. \"At the end of the day, we're all here to save money,\" she said.\n\n3. Use couponing to your advantage\n\nSwanson encourages younger people to use couponing to help save money. While she says it's not the answer to everything, Swanson points out, \"Why would you want to pay $3 for a thing of toothpaste when you can get it for free? That $3 can be spent elsewhere and it does add up fast.\"", "description": "Katie Swanson uses TikTok to teach young people how to coupon.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191016_gma_worley_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
