A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\u201d\n\nSince entering the White House, Mr Trump has steadfastly refused to release the documents, bucking a tradition going back to Richard Nixon that presidents make their tax returns available to demonstrate they do not have conflicts of interest.\n\nWhile Mr Trump said in 2016 that he would be happy to release them if elected, he has since backtracked, claiming variously that he was unable to do so while they were under audit and insisting that people were not interested in seeing them.\n\nJudge Marrero wrote: \u201cAs the court reads it, presidential immunity would stretch to cover every phase of criminal proceedings, including investigations, grand jury proceedings and subpoenas, indictment, prosecution, arrest, trial, conviction, and incarceration.\n\n\u201cThat constitutional protection presumably would encompass any conduct, at any time, in any forum, whether federal or state, and whether the president acted alone or in concert with other individuals.\u201d\n\nHe said that he could not endorse \u201csuch a categorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process as being countenanced by the nation\u2019s constitutional plan, especially in the light of the fundamental concerns over excessive arrogation of power that animated the Constitution\u2019s delicate structure and its calibrated balance of authority among the three branches of the national government, as well as between the federal and state authorities\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, was jailed for crimes including campaign finance violations connected to the payments.\n\nHe claimed that the payments were made at the instigation of \u201cIndividual 1\u201d, believed to be Mr Trump. The president has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "Donald Trump has been ordered to release his tax returns after a judge ruled that being president did not make him immune from investigation.
