To them, Yang's use of Asian stereotypes is damaging and hurtful.\n\nKarthick Ramakrishnan, of Riverside, California, is the founder of AAPI (Asian-American Pacific-Islander) Data, an agency that offers demographic data and research on the Asian-American Pacific-Islander population. He believes while Yang's handling of his race may draw him some support, it's also worked to repel his Asian-American base.\n\n\"I think this week was a turning point where he lost a lot of Asian-Americans, in which they don't see Andrew Yang as someone who's expressing bold ideas or fresh angles,\" he said.\n\nIs Yang sincere, or is he just using his Asian-American identity as a ploy in the election?\n\nRamakrishnan is referring to Yang's response to Shane Gillis, who earlier this week was fired from \"Saturday Night Live\" after video of Gillis using racist terms and saying hurtful things about Asians emerged. In a Twitter thread on Sunday, Yang recalled his own experiences with race-based bullying.\n\n\"I've been called chink and gook any number of times in my life. It can be extraordinarily hurtful to feel like you are somehow not part of the only country you have ever known. I have certainly felt that - the churning sense of alienation, anger, and marginalization,\" he wrote.\n\nBut Yang, a son of Taiwanese immigrants, offered forgiveness to Gillis and said he shouldn't have been fired from his job.\n\nYang, went on to take issue with cancel culture.\n\nMembers of the Asian-American community were disappointed.\n\n\"I think I wanted him to fight,\" Stephanie Hao, a Taiwanese-American student living in Rochester, New York, told Insider. \"It's important for someone to stand up for the minority and tell Gillis that was blatant racism.\"\n\n\"As an Asian-American presidential candidate, if you're not willing to make a strong stance for the minority, how is anyone else supposed to look up to you?\" Hao said.\n\nComedian Shane Gillis.

He thinks Yang is treating his presidential campaign like a startup \u2014 and that tactic has consequences.\n\n\"Coming from an entrepreneur background like him, I understand what he's doing. He's using the things that he has to get people's attention,\" Chen added. \"I guess he had to latch onto the whole Asian stereotype because people think it's funny.\"\n\nIn other words, Asian-Americans have observed Yang use his Asian-American identity as a political tool to garner attention and curry favor with voters whenever possible. At the same time, Yang needs non-Asians votes to win the nomination. It's a slippery balancing act between playing spokesperson for Asian-Americans and appealing to a broader support base.\n\nEven if Yang is confident, the 'model minority' myth is still harmful\n\nNot all Asian-Americans condemn Yang's continued evocation of Asian stereotypes on his campaign trail.\n\nGlenn Luk, a Chinese-American living in New York, believes the jokes demonstrate the extent to which Yang is comfortable in his skin.\n\n\"I think it takes a next-level confidence in one's Asian-American identity to say those things,\" said Luk. \"He seems to be very confident in being Asian, and he's happy to reinforce the positive stereotypes.\"\n\nPositive stereotypes, however, tend to play into the idea of the model minority myth, which experts say was built on racism and destructive grounds. The myth's roots go back to the 1960s, when those in political power used the term to point at Asians as a well-behaving minority group from which other nonwhite, \"problematic communities\" could learn.\n\nYang buying lemonade for some of his staff and supporters during the Des Moines, Iowa State Fair in August. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nYang has also been criticized for his belief that society treats racism towards Asians and blacks differently.\n\n\"Anti-Asian racism is particularly virulent because it's somehow considered more acceptable,\" Mr. Yang argued on Twitter. \"If Shane had used the N-word, the treatment would likely be immediate and clear.\"\n\n\"Black and Asian-American treatment are just not comparable,\" said Franklin Odo, the founding director of the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American program Amherst, Massachusetts, who's spent much of his career since the 1990s trying to dispel the model minority myth.\n\nAsian-American groups view Yang as the beginning of a new wave\n\nBeyond Yang's fickle approach to his identity, every Asian-American Insider spoke to agree that Yang has an unconventional but potentially effective platform. His campaign, which centers on tackling automation and mass unemployment through Universal Basic Income, has attracted both white, male Trump supporters and progressive Asian-Americans.\n\n\"Despite his comments, I don't think he's necessarily harming our race because he himself is proving that Asians can be more than engineers and doctors and I respect him for that,\" said Kevin Park, a Korean-American from New York.\n\nYang at the September primary debate.

His presence in the 2020 presidential field is an unprecedented moment for the Asian community in America.\n\nIt also speaks to an overall increase in Asian presence in both candidates and voting pools. For the first time, there are three Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) candidates running for a major party's nomination for president: Andrew Yang, Kamala Harris, and Tulsi Gabbard. Research has also shown that the rate among Asian youth voter participation has nearly tripled from 9 to 26 percent in the past few years.\n\nYang speaking at the Philadelphia Council AFL-CIO Workers Presidential Summit in September.

But the Asian-American community knows he is just the beginning of a new wave.\n\n\"I think a lot of younger Asian-Americans will probably be inspired to run for office thinking in unconventional ways he has,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"But hopefully not make the same mistakes.\"", "description": "Democratic 2020 presidential nominee Andrew Yang often makes jokes about his Asian-American identity.
