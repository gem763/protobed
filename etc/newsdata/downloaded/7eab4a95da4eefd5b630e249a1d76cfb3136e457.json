REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis/Files\n\nRussia is jostling to capture market share in fast-growing India against rivals Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates.\n\nDharmendra Pradhan said he had met the chief executive of oil producer Rosneft and that four Indian companies planned to increase their investment in Russian oilfields.\n\n\u201cToday I met excellency Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft. We elaborately discussed the possibility of oil imports,\u201d Pradhan told reporters.\n\nIn the wake of weekend attacks that have hampered Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil output, the oil minister also attempted to calm nerves on supply, saying he was confident that India, the world\u2019s third-largest oil consumer, had a diverse crude basket.\n\nRosneft, the world\u2019s largest listed oil producer by output, confirmed that a possible increase of oil supplies to Indian refineries had been discussed.\n\nRosneft and the government also discussed the development of Nayara \u0415nergy, a company in which Rosneft holds a majority stake.\n\nThe consortium is reviewing an option of a two-fold increase in refining throughput at the Vadinar Refinery, Rosneft said.\n\nIn the first stage, the consortium has committed to invest $850 million towards the building of a petrochemical unit within two years.\n\n\u201cThe consortium is also planning to expand Nayara Energy\u2019s retail presence, which is currently the fastest growing pan-India fuel retail network with over 5,300 retail outlets,\u201d Rosneft said in a statement.\n\nIt also said joint projects - specifically Sakhalin-1 (oil and gas project), Taas-Yuryakh and Vankor (oilfields in Russia) - were being reviewed, but did not elaborate.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, and the second-largest supplier of crude to India after Iraq. India reduced the Middle East\u2019s share in its total oil imports to about 56% in July from around 60% a year ago, while increasing its share of imports from Africa and the United States.\n\nTwo sources briefed on state oil company Saudi Aramco\u2019s operations told Reuters it might take months for oil production to return to normal. Earlier estimates had suggested it could take weeks.\n\n\u201cThis incident is huge,\u201d India\u2019s Pradhan said in his first news conference following the attacks.\n\n\u201cBut yesterday we lifted oil, and today also we lifted oil,\u201d he said.", "description": "India is looking at raising oil imports from Russia, its oil minister said on Tuesday, at a time of surging oil prices after an attack on Saudi Arabian facilities halved the kingdom's production.", "authors": ["Sudarshan Varadhan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430793066&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0OP", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
