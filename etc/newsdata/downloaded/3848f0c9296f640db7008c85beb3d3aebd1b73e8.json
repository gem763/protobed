The Iran-aligned Houthi militant group in Yemen claimed responsibility.\n\nPublicly, the Pentagon has responded by sending thousands of additional troops and equipment to bolster Saudi defences - the latest US deployment to the region this year.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment about the cyber strike.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of policy and for operational security, we do not discuss cyberspace operations, intelligence, or planning,\u201d said Pentagon spokeswoman Elissa Smith.\n\nThe impact of the attack, if any, could take months to determine, but cyber strikes are seen as a less-provocative option below the threshold of war.\n\nTensions in the Gulf have escalated sharply since May 2018, when Mr Trump withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Tehran \u2014 otherwise known as the Iran Nuclear Deal \u2014 that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for the easing of sanctions.\n\nIt was unclear whether there have been other US cyber attacks since the one in late September.\n\nReuters contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\nIran oil tanker on fire after \u2018being hit by rockets in terror attack\u2019", "description": "The US conducted a secretive cyber operation against Iran in September shortly after Tehran was accused by Donald Trump\u2019s administration of carrying out attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.Two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity told Reuters the operation took place in late September", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/f8HKxOdRWEKPnP1LTsmNWA--~B/aD0yOTY7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/7a8622a77bf98520ddcfb052612a81d4", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
