Formal china isn\u2019t a staple in many homes anymore. According to Jeffra Trumpower, a senior creative director at WeddingWire, \u201cEntertaining has become much more casual. Couples are registering for things to make that experience more their own instead of the things that used to define fine dining or entertaining.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat to do with stacks of dinnerware is a hot issue in many households. The topic swirls through family holiday meal discussions and decluttering forays. Between guilt and sentimentality, many households have trouble releasing their heirloom china.\n\n\u201cI was just at a house today where the woman had nine sets of china,\u201d says Libby Kinkead of Potomac Concierge, which offers downsizing and moving services. When clients protest that they are keeping all of this \u201cin honor of granny,\u201d Kinkead says she asks them: \u201cHow are you honoring your grandmother\u2019s memory by keeping your china sitting in a box in the attic? That\u2019s not honoring anything.\u201d\n\nWhy vintage tableware is making a comeback in restaurants and homes\n\nSo what else can you do with heirloom plates and cups? You could take a hammer to them and make the broken pieces into jewelry or a pique assiette mosaic mirror. But that might be too disturbing. Here are five other ideas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCreate a plate wall\n\nGeorgia designer James Farmer is a big fan of hanging plates in an arrangement on the wall. \u201cIf you can\u2019t use your plates every day, they can become art,\u201d Farmer says. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful way to celebrate your heritage.\u201d He suggests starting with a larger piece, such as a platter, in the middle as inspiration and hanging the rest around it. He mixes patterns, shapes and sizes and sometimes adds in art for more of a gallery wall look.\n\nFarmer\u2019s method is usually to first arrange plates on the floor or on a tabletop until he is pleased with the look. He takes a photo of the final placement for reference, then puts up the nails and hangs the plates, which he has secured with old-fashioned wire plate hangers. His favorites are Tripar brass-coated plate hangers from Ace Hardware. Sometimes he adds a bit of Collectors Hold Museum Putty to anchor them, especially if plates are hanging near a doorway.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA lot of people think this is part of a Southern tradition, but it\u2019s very French and English,\u201d Farmer says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re watching a Jane Austen movie, check out the walls. They are adorned with plates that have been hanging there for hundreds of years.\u201d\n\nUse dishes to deliver a gift\n\nIf you must divest yourself of a set of china and you want to feel as though it is going to a good home, take matters into your own hands. Start making host or hostess gift plates, says Kinkead: plates you fill with homemade cookies or bars and bring to your friends and family when you are invited over. Use the cups and saucers to fill with a selection of nice teas, and gift those to your nearest and dearest. If you feel inclined, write a charming note on a gift card describing the provenance of the china.\n\nThis can work for presents for housewarmings, baby showers or birthdays. Be creative. If you\u2019re drowning in Spode Christmas Tree plates, give them away during December when others can make use of them as appetizer serving plates.\n\nHave china upcycled\n\nThe Brooklyn Teacup sells ready-made tiered stands made of vintage plates that Davis finds in thrift shops or on Facebook Marketplace. She also does custom design for customers who provide her with their china. Davis can take several-size plates and a teacup and create a stand, in whatever arrangement you like. A custom three-tier stand costs about $50 between the hardware and the drilling; she has a minimum order of $250, which will get you about five stands you can share with family. Then you can \u00adde-accession the rest of the set without feeling guilty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSadie Horton of Brooklyn Heights was a recent customer. \u201cIt\u2019s all about finding new ways to use old things,\u201d says Horton, who uses hers for fruit in her kitchen. \u201cThis is a great way to repurpose something that you would really hate to just put out in recycling.\u201d\n\nRepurpose pieces as planters\n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty about breaking up a china set: Soup tureens and teacups can be repurposed as beautiful containers for plants. Sell or donate the rest.\n\nCynthia Nouri, owner of the luxury gift registry Sasha Nicholas, often counsels couples on how to refresh and repurpose old china and posts ideas on her popular Instagram feed. You can fill a flower-bedecked Herend serving bowl full of orchid plants or plant herbs in a row of Wedgwood teacups you keep on a windowsill. \u201cAn interesting soup tureen with the matching platter underneath filled with plants can make a beautiful centerpiece,\u201d Nouri says. \u201cLooking at these pieces reminds you of sitting at the table with old friends and past generations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe suggests putting small pebbles at the bottom for drainage. \u201cI\u2019ve seen tea cups used with cute fresh flower arrangements on a table or as an accent in a powder room,\u201d Nouri says. \u201cThere are so many ways to use these pieces. You don\u2019t need to keep the whole set to remind you of its history.\u201d\n\nGive it one last party\n\nYou\u2019ve concluded that you just can\u2019t keep the china you inherited from your great-aunt. If you\u2019ve emailed every distant relative and canvassed your friends and can\u2019t find anyone who wants the Noritake Nanarosa, it\u2019s time to party. \u201cUnwrap it all and set your table, invite your friends and have one last great time with your china,\u201d Kinkead says. Take lots of photos and post them on Instagram. Then, get over it and kiss the china goodbye.\n\nAD\n\nIf you can\u2019t find a consignment shop, give it away on Craigslist, Freecycle or your neighborhood email group. You could call a local church and see if they have a family who might like some china for the holidays. Your conscience can then be clear. Your basement and attic will be liberated, your kitchen cabinets will have more space for food, and your sideboard can be filled with pieces you really like and use. \u201cThen it\u2019s your memories you hold on to,\u201d Kinkead says, \u201cnot all that stuff.\u201d\n\nMore from Lifestyle:\n\nAmid a national decluttering frenzy, 5 families share the heirlooms they can\u2019t part with\n\nAmericans are pack rats.
