Bipartisan lawmakers have panned the operation as threatening to groups that allied with the U.S. in the fight against ISIS.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump said in a statement Monday he is slapping sanctions on government officials in Ankara and \u201cany persons contributing to Turkey\u2019s destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.\u201d\n\nThe sanctions targeted the Turkish Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Energy and National Resources, as well as the leaders of those two agencies and the head of the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nThe sanctions include an increase on steel tariffs from 25 percent to 50 percent and a halt in trade negotiations with Turkey.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s military offensive is endangering civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan: Turkey\u2019s action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.\u201d\n\nSome critics of the sanctions said they were insufficient, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi says Trump sanctions package on Turkey 'falls very short' Graham throws support behind Trump's Turkey sanctions Feehery: Trump may be down, but he's not out yet MORE (D-Calif.) saying the package \"falls very short of reversing that humanitarian disaster.\"\n\n\u201cYes, they do,\u201d Swalwell responded when asked by CNN host Jim Sciutto if sanctions have a chance of working. \u201cTurkey, as you know, Jim, is also a NATO ally and I don\u2019t think they want to be kicked out of NATO, which is also something that I think may be on the table here. And so we should in a bipartisan way seek to do that to change Turkey\u2019s behavior.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, which removed the chief deterrent to Turkey\u2019s operation, was also the focus of bipartisan ire on Capitol Hill, with many saying it paved the way for the offensive.\n\nThe Pentagon on Monday announced the official withdrawal of U.S. forces from northeastern Syria, adding that \"a small footprint\" of U.S. forces will remain at the al-Tanf garrison in southern Syria \"to continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS.\"", "description": "Rep.
