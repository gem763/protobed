The bird population in the United States and Canada was probably around 10.1 billion nearly half a century ago and has fallen 29% to about 7.2 billion birds, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal Science.\n\n\u201cPeople need to pay attention to the birds around them because they are slowly disappearing,\u201d said study lead author Kenneth Rosenberg, a Cornell University conservation scientist. \u201cOne of the scary things about the results is that it is happening right under our eyes. We might not even notice it until it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nRosenberg and colleagues projected population data using weather radar, 13 different bird surveys going back to 1970 and computer modeling to come up with trends for 529 species of North American birds. That\u2019s not all species, but more than three-quarters of them and most of the missed species are quite rare, Rosenberg said.\n\nUsing weather radar data, which captures flocks of migrating birds, is a new method, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark paper. It\u2019s put numbers to everyone\u2019s fears about what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Joel Cracraft, curator-in-charge for ornithology of the American Museum of Natural History, who wasn\u2019t part of the study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even more stark than what many of us might have guessed,\u201d Cracraft said.\n\nEvery year University of Connecticut\u2019s Margaret Rubega, the state ornithologist, gets calls from people noticing fewer birds. And this study, which she wasn\u2019t part of, highlights an important problem, she said.\n\n\u201cIf you came out of your house one morning and noticed that a third of all the houses in your neighborhood were empty, you\u2019d rightly conclude that something threatening was going on,\u201d Rubega said in an email. \u201c3 billion of our neighbors, the ones who eat the bugs that destroy our food plants and carry diseases like equine encephalitis, are gone. I think we all ought to think that\u2019s threatening.\u201d\n\nSome of the most common and recognizable birds are taking the biggest hits, even though they are not near disappearing yet, Rosenberg said.\n\nThe common house sparrow was at the top of the list for losses, as were many other sparrows. The population of eastern meadowlarks has shriveled by more than three-quarters with the western meadowlark nearly as hard hit. Bobwhite quail numbers are down 80%, Rosenberg said.\n\nGrassland birds in general are less than half what they used to be, he said.\n\nNot all bird populations are shrinking. For example, bluebirds are increasing, mostly because people have worked hard to get their numbers up.\n\nRosenberg, a birdwatcher since he was 3, has seen this firsthand over more than 60 years. When he was younger there would be \u201cinvasions\u201d of evening grosbeaks that his father would take him to see in Upstate New York with 200 to 300 birds around one feeder. Now, he said, people get excited when they see 10 grosbeaks.\n\nThe research only covered wild birds, not domesticated ones such as chickens.\n\nRosenberg\u2019s study didn\u2019t go into what\u2019s making wild birds dwindle away, but he pointed to past studies that blame habitat loss, cats and windows.\n\n\u201cEvery field you lose, you lose the birds from that field,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that so many things are killing birds in large numbers, like cats and windows.\u201d\n\nExperts say habitat loss was the No. 1 reason for bird loss. A 2015 study said cats kill 2.6 billion birds each year in the United States and Canada, while window collisions kill another 624 million and cars another 214 million.\n\nThat\u2019s why people can do their part by keeping cats indoors, treating their home windows to reduce the likelihood that birds will crash into them, stopping pesticide and insecticide use at home and buying coffee grown on farms with forest-like habitat, said Sara Hallager, bird curator at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n\u201cWe can reverse that trend,\u201d Hallager said. \u201cWe can turn the tide.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears and Christina Larson at @larsonchristina .\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
