As it happens, Thursday night's referee is Ivan Bebek of Croatia, who was in charge of the Bulgaria v England game, although Neil Lennon stressed that he wanted to accentuate the positive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping tomorrow is a celebration of football between two great clubs. In the main I think Lazio have a great support,\u201d said the Celtic manager. \u201cThere is always a minority who want to make noise for the wrong reasons or put a stain on the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping at the end of the game we\u2019re talking about the great atmosphere for two great sides playing in a great game of football.\u201d\n\nRyan Christie, the Celtic midfielder, added: \u201cIf racial abuse becomes a part of this game then it\u2019s up to Uefa and the referees to make a decision. I\u2019d obviously have no qualms about walking off the park.\n\n\u201cIn this day and age, it\u2019s probably going to need strong stances like that to really put a message across and try and stop it.\u201d\n\nOn the field of play, Lennon hopes to see an end to Celtic\u2019s poor record against Italian opposition. Although their greatest triumph was against Inter Milan in the 1967 European Cup final of 1967, the Hoops have won only four of another 24 ties.", "description": "Celtic\u2019s home tie against Lazio in the Europa League on Thursday evening has the potential to be a gala occasion for the Scottish champions \u2013 already top of Group E \u2013 but the occasion could also be a platform for racist behaviour of the sort which nearly forced England\u2019s players to walk off during their recent Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000155299094-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPyfDuPkl4WkL6HIHGe9AHwmZI4N0_9-i5kM6sXqxWwE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
