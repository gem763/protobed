You should be, according to this list", "language": "en", "text": "Who runs the world? These girls.\n\nThe BBC dropped its 2019 list of the 100 most inspiring and influential women across the globe on Wednesday, and it should come as no surprise that U.S. congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Swedish anti-climate-change activist Greta Thunberg and American soccer star and equal-pay advocate Megan Rapinoe made the cut.\n\nThis year\u2019s list was drawn from the question, \u201cWhat would the future look like if it were driven by women?\u201d And these formidable females have certainly been driving conversation this year.\n\nNews cycles spin around Ocasio-Cortez, 29, no matter what she does \u2014 from endorsing Bernie Sanders for her party\u2019s presidential nomination to visiting migrant detention facilities on the U.S. border \u2014 even getting a haircut.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for a future where no person is left behind,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the BBC. \u201cWhen people want to stop talking about the issues that black women face, trans women face, immigrant women face, we\u2019ve got to ask them, \u2018Why does that make you so uncomfortable?\u2019 Because it\u2019s not just about identity; this is about justice. Everyone deserves justice.\u201d\n\nThunberg, 15, led the largest climate protest in history across 150 countries last month. She also gave an impassioned U.N. speech that sparked strong responses from the likes of President Trump \u2014 after crossing the Atlantic in a solar-powered boat to get there, encouraging others to reduce their own carbon footprints. She\u2019s also advocated for special needs by referring to her Asperger\u2019s diagnosis as a \u201csuperpower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cAnd now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly.\u201d\n\nU.S. Women\u2019s National Team co-captain Rapinoe, 34, led Team USA to the Women\u2019s World Cup, and scored the honor of Best FIFA Women\u2019s Player 2019 while in the midst of taking legal action against the U.S. Soccer Federation over gander-based pay inequality. She has also advocated for LGBTQ rights, and spoken out against racism by taking a page from NFL star Colin Kaepernick\u2019s playbook and protesting during the U.S. national anthem.\n\n\u201cIf everybody was as outraged about racism as those who suffer it, if everybody was as outraged about homophobia as LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about the lack of equal pay as women, that would be the most inspiring thing for the future to me,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\nThe female trailblazers on BBC\u2019s list who are credited with \u201cdriving change on behalf of women everywhere\u201d include MIT scientist Katie Bouman, whose algorithm led to the first real image of a black hole earlier this year; U.K. sprinter Dina Asher-Smith, the fastest woman in British history; and Malaysian trans woman and activist Nisha Ayub, who was put into a male prison at the age of 21.\n\nCheck out the complete list below.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s 100 most inspiring and influential women for 2019:\n\n\u2022 Precious Adams, ballet dancer, U.S.\n\n\u2022 Parveena Ahanger, human rights activist, Indian-administered Kashmir\n\n\u2022 Piera Aiello, politician, Italy\n\n\u2022 Jasmin Akter, cricketer, U.K.-Bangladesh\n\n\u2022 Manal AlDowayan, artist, Saudi Arabia\n\n\u2022 Kimia Alizadeh, athlete, Iran\n\n\u2022 Alanoud Alsharekh, women\u2019s-rights activist, Kuwait\n\n\u2022 Marwa Al-Sabouni, architect, Syria\n\n\u2022 Rida Al Tubuly, peace campaigner, Libya\n\n\u2022 Tabata Amaral, congresswoman, Brazil\n\n\u2022 Yalitza Aparicio, actor and human-rights activist, Mexico\n\n\u2022 Dayna Ash, cultural activist, Lebanon\n\n\u2022 Dina Asher-Smith, athlete, U.K.\n\n\u2022 MiMi Aung, project manager at NASA, U.S.\n\n\u2022 Nisha Ayub, transgender activist, Malaysia\n\n\u2022 Judith Bakirya, farmer, Uganda\n\n\u2022 Ayah Bdeir, entrepreneur, Lebanon\n\n\u2022 Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, monk, Thailand\n\n\u2022 Mabel Bianco, doctor, Argentina\n\n\u2022 Raya Bidshahri, educator, Iran\n\n\u2022 Katie Bouman, scientist, U.S.\n\n\u2022 Sin\u00e9ad Burke, disability activist, Ireland\n\n\u2022 Lisa Campo-Engelstein, bioethicist, U.S.\n\n\u2022 Scarlett Curtis, writer and campaigner, U.K.\n\n\u2022 Ella Daish, environmentalist, U.K.\n\n\u2022 Sharan Dhaliwal, artist and writer, U.K.\n\n\u2022 Salwa Eid Naser, athlete, Nigeria-Bahrain\n\n\u2022 Rana El Kaliouby, AI pioneer, Egypt\n\n\u2022 Maria Fernanda Espinosa, U.N.
