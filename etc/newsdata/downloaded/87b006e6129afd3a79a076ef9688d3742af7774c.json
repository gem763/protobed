As I write this column on Friday evening, no indictment has been returned against McCabe. From this, and what seems to be some hopeful speculation about \u201chints of the case\u2019s weakness\u201d that could possibly have caused grand jurors to \u201cbalk,\u201d the Times and the Post suggest that maybe the grand jury has voted against an indictment.\n\nThis supposition has prompted a letter to the Justice Department from McCabe\u2019s attorney, Michael Bromwich \u2014 a former colleague of mine who, besides being a skilled and shrewd attorney, is a Democrat and was last seen representing Christine Blasey Ford, Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser. Bromwich says he is hearing \u201crumors from reporters\u201d about the filing of a \u201cno true bill\u201d \u2014 i.e., a grand-jury vote rejecting a proposed indictment of McCabe.\n\nWhile conceding that he \u201cdo[es] not know the specific basis for the rumors,\u201d Bromwich intuits that they must be reliable because the newspapers ran with the story. Mind you, neither the Times nor the Post claims to have been told by any grand jurors that they declined to indict McCabe; nor do they report hearing from any knowledgeable government official that a no true bill was voted. Nevertheless, McCabe\u2019s legal team is demanding that the Justice Department disclose whether an indictment was declined and refrain from seeking an indictment in the future.\n\nThis gambit, of course, floats the narrative that the case against McCabe must be crumbling \u2014 the media reports spur the Bromwich letter, which spur more media reports, rinse and repeat. But even allowing for the erosion of standards, this is thin gruel for both news reporting and legal claims.\n\nI\u2019ll add more detail presently. To cut to the chase, though, there is no reason at this point to infer that the grand jury has voted against indicting McCabe.\n\nNow, let\u2019s back up.\n\nAs I reiterated in a column on Thursday, the criminal probe of McCabe stems, at least in part, from an investigation by Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz. That inquest centered on McCabe\u2019s orchestration of a leak to the Wall Street Journal of investigative information \u2014 specifically, of the fact that the FBI was investigating the Clinton Foundation. McCabe is alleged to have lied in several interviews by FBI agents. It is a crime to make false statements to investigators. IG Horowitz outlined the false-statements allegations against McCabe in a meticulous 35-page report, filed in February 2018.\n\nAs is required when the IG turns up evidence of potential criminal conduct, the matter was referred to the Justice Department for consideration of whether charges should be filed. Because the IG probe and the alleged false statements occurred in Washington, the matter ended up in the United States attorney\u2019s office for the District of Columbia.\n\nThere, the U.S. attorney, Jesse Liu, has reportedly decided that there is enough evidence to charge felonies. Bromwich, however, was permitted to appeal Liu\u2019s decision to the Justice Department \u2014 specifically, to Jeffrey Rosen, the deputy attorney general. According to media reports, DAG Rosen was unpersuaded; the Justice Department thus advised the McCabe defense team in an email that their appeal has been rejected, and that any further questions should be taken up with U.S. Attorney Liu\u2019s office.\n\nIt was assumed when this news broke on Thursday that the Justice Department\u2019s rejection was the last hurdle standing in the way of charges, and therefore that an indictment must be imminent. It has now been reported that, although the grand jury met on Thursday, no indictment was filed.\n\nThat, however, is no reason to conclude that an indictment was sought, much less that the grand jury declined to vote one.\n\nLet me begin with the basics. No competent federal prosecutor should ever get a no true bill from a grand jury. In nearly 20 years as a prosecutor, it not only never happened to me; I could count on one hand the number of times I heard of it happening to any other prosecutor in the office, and still have fingers to spare.", "description": "In coverage of the Andrew McCabe investigation, there seems to be a lot of adding two plus two and coming up with five.The New York Times and Washington Post have reported that a grand jury met on Thursday in connection with a probe involving McCabe, the FBI\u2019s former deputy director.
