Respondents were 1,721 likely 2020 voters, including an oversample of 1,227 likely Democrat primary voters. The poll\u2019s margin of error is \u00b12.4.\n\nThe poll\u2019s outcome places a spotlight on the vast disconnect between the education platform of the Democrat Party \u2014 one that remains closely aligned with the demands of the national teachers\u2019 unions \u2014 and a plurality of its base.\n\nThough several Democrat candidates were once staunch supporters of charter schools, as presidential candidates they have focused more on criticism of the Trump administration\u2019s central education theme of school choice and of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.\n\nAs Education Week reports, Democrat candidates Joe Biden, Cory Booker, and Michael Bennet had all been supportive of charter schools prior to becoming presidential candidates.\n\nIn May, however, Biden said he will \u201cnot support any federal money for for-profit charter schools. Period.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders has been clear he would ban charter schools from being run by for-profit entities and would audit all existing charter schools.\n\nElizabeth Warren said, \u201cMoney for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else.\u201d However, she praised the charter schools in her home state of Massachusetts as \u201csuccessful, thoughtful, and innovative.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg has said he would \u201ctake steps\u201d to pull back on charter school expansion, while Juli\u00e1n Castro has said he would demand more \u201caccountability\u201d for charter schools than is required now due to the fact they are run independently.\n\nKamala Harris acted against charter schools when she was California\u2019s attorney general and supported the Los Angeles teachers who demanded more rules for charter schools when they went out on strike in January.\n\nAmy Klobuchar has said charter schools must meet \u201chigh standards\u201d if they want to meet the definition of public schools.\n\nAndrew Yang said, \u201cI am pro-good school\u201d during the last Democrat debate.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke has said for-profit charter schools should be banned, but, in June, said \u201cthere is a role\u201d for them.\n\nDFER states school choice is \u201cin line with the Obama education legacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that our public schools need to be better funded, but that\u2019s just the beginning of the story,\u201d said Shavar Jeffries, president of DFER, and added:\n\nThe public sees that we need to more fairly fund underserved schools and pay teachers more who teach hard-to-staff subjects and serve in high-need schools. The poll findings are a call to action to continue the work started by President Obama and find ways to make our schools more equitable.\n\nLeft-wing groups, such as Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and LGBT activist organizations, have muscled their way into charter schools in California. In 2018, the California Healthy Youth Act required comprehensive sex education (CSE) to be taught in charter schools as well as traditional public schools.\n\nMeanwhile, some teachers\u2019 unions have opened membership to charter school teachers. In December 2018, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and the American Federation of Teachers backed the nation\u2019s first strike by charter school teachers.\n\nHowever, officials from the Illinois Network of Charter Schools (INCS) criticized CTU\u2019s involvement in the negotiations, saying the strike would restrict the independence of the charter school.\n\n\u201cIf we accede to the idea that every unionized charter in Chicago has to have the exact same (working conditions), pretty soon we\u2019re going to lose what the movement has contributed to the city \u2014 which is a vibrancy, a differential approach,\u201d INCS president Andrew Broy said, according to the Chicago Tribune. \u201cIt would be a step backward for the city if we go down that path.\u201d\n\nThe acceptance of charter schools in the education platform of the Democrat Party would likely mean a more robust attempt on its part to force charter schools to become more like traditional public schools under the banner of \u201caccountability\u201d for taxpayer dollars.", "description": "A new poll finds 81 percent of Democrat primary voters, including 89 percent of black Democrat primary voters, support charter schools.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Charter-schools-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
