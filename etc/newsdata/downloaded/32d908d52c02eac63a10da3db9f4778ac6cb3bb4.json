Maybe he was 11.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been four years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really mind.\u201d\n\nHe stopped knocking on doors with friends not because he dislikes the holiday. He stopped because he really, really loves it. He stopped because he wanted to spend that evening giving his D.C. neighborhood \u2014 and the strangers drawn there each year by homes that tend to hand out full-sized candy bars \u2014 a haunting experience.\n\nHis neighbors in The Palisades already know that as soon as the sun sets on Oct. 31, the teenager\u2019s garage will open to visitors, and inside, they will find carefully crafted decorations, eerie music and costumed actors ready to jump out with terrifying timing.\n\nThey will find scenes that took Chase months to put together and that show an impressive attention to detail \u2014 and not only because of his age.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe focus the work takes does not come easy to Chase, who is a ninth grader at the Lab School of Washington, which describes its students as \u201clearning differently.\u201d He was diagnosed years ago with severe attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.\n\n\u201cIt makes me really distracted,\u201d Chase says. He explains that he can go from sitting in class to noticing a squirrel outside the window and suddenly his thoughts are chasing that squirrel. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a distraction, a distraction, a distraction everywhere.\u201d\n\nBut for his haunted creation, he uses the very skills that, even with medication, can be elusive for him: concentration and commitment. Months before Halloween, he starts brainstorming ideas, planning out the space and searching for bargain-priced props. On the day of the holiday, he does the makeup for all his friends and puts the final vivid touches on the scenery outside the family\u2019s home and inside their garage.\n\n\u201cThat requires an incredible amount of dedication and focus,\u201d says his mother, Melina Bellows. She recalls how after the arm broke on a figure outside their home, her son called the manufacturer and when he didn\u2019t hear back from anyone, went to Home Depot to find the right adhesive. \u201cWe all have our challenges. But if you can find your passion, you\u2019ll find a workaround. He just works tirelessly on this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs we talk on a recent evening, she points toward a fog machine. The white smoke spilling from it contains a strange, yet familiar scent. It takes a moment, and a few deep inhales, before I recognize the smell of a hospital. Think Vicks VapoRub. Chase found the special fog online while looking for items that would fit this year\u2019s theme of asylum.\n\nAll across the family\u2019s yard are items that he has given a lot of thought toward. Some he found at bargain shops. Others he pulled from dumpsters. A few were given to him as birthday and Christmas presents.\n\nFrom his grandmother, he received a towering white figure in a pinstripe suit with wispy black hair. \u201cI am everywhere,\u201d it says. \u201cCome to me, my children. Come with me. You are all my children now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSeveral steps away, a child-sized doll dressed in a stained sailor shirt sits on a battered red tricycle. Chase found him in an antique store on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore. The conversation with the salesman, he recalls, went something like this.\n\nAD\n\nSalesman: That thing is creepy. We think it\u2019s haunted.\n\nChase: Perfect.\n\nHe still remembers the first Halloween decoration his family bought. He was maybe 5 when his mother brought home a 6-foot-tall dancing Frankenstein. \u201cIt was the funniest thing ever,\u201d he recalls.\n\nChase was about 10 when he first turned his garage into a haunted space. That year, it wasn\u2019t scary at all.\n\n\u201cNow, people are hesitant to go in,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were people that cried last year.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLast year, when the theme was \u201ctoy factory,\u201d between 200 and 400 people shuffled through the small space in one night, the teenager and his mother estimate. This year, they are not sure how many to expect.\n\n\u201cThe kids in the neighborhood look forward to it all year,\u201d Melina Bellows says. \u201cThey start their Halloween here and end their Halloween here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThose who come this year will find themselves walking through a maze of white sheets hanging from the ceiling. They will pass by yellowed and tattered posters that show \u201cmissing\u201d people and \u201crules for patients.\u201d And before they exit a minute later, they will feel long strands of dangling hair brush against them and watch actors, played by Chase\u2019s friends, pop out unexpectedly.\n\n\u201cWhere your foot is, they\u2019re going to reach out,\u201d he tells me during an early tour.\n\nAs the 15-year-old talks, he holds a plastic severed hand as if it\u2019s an empty water bottle. The more animated he gets, the more the lifeless limb moves. After he reveals some of his creative secrets, such as how he rubbed oats and acrylic paint together to create one doll\u2019s frightening appearance, I ask him to show me what he is most proud of. He can\u2019t decide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of proud of everything,\u201d he says. \u201cThat I was able to do this in two months. This is a big thing for me. I have to focus on one thing to get it done, and it can be really draining sometimes.\u201d\n\nIn years past, the haunted experience has been free. This year, Chase will ask visitors to leave one piece of candy as an entry fee.\n\nHe and his mom plan to donate whatever is given \u2014 Milky Way bars and all \u2014 to the Mattie Miracle Cancer Foundation, which distributes the candy to hospitals and nonprofits that assist children with cancer and other needs.\n\nOnce Halloween ends, most young people divide their sugary treats, put away their costumes and fall back into their normal routines. Chase will still have work to do. He has to clean the garage so his mother can park her car in it again. He also plans to search Halloween sales for items he can use next year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlready, he is thinking about that display. This year, his mom vetoed his suggestion to use a chain saw prop. She also \u2014 once again \u2014 told him he could not expand his creation into the house.\n\n\u201cBut next year,\u201d he tells me, \u201cwho knows?\u201d\n\nRead more from Theresa Vargas:\n\nAD", "description": "Chase Bellows, 15, has been transforming his D.C. garage into a Halloween haunt for neighbors since he was 10.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4Gm1t85mPvwGNwpYiyVwnVWHWc0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E6HSYOX24MI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
