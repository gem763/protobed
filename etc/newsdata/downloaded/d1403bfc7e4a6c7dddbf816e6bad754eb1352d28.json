Cointelegraph Brasil reported on Sept. 20 that, according to the administrators of the building that housed the company, the rooms that belonged to Unick have already been handed over and are ready to be rented.\n\nOn Oct. 1, Leidimar Lopes, the president of Unick Forex, published an official statement claiming that the firm will continue to operate as normal, following a purported upgrade to the platform. The executive stressed that the firm will pay its customers through an extrajudicial agreement, promising that all clients will be able to withdraw their funds as requested.\n\nIn the statement, Lopes noted that Unick Forex is not an investment platform, but rather an educational platform for sharing content in areas such as online marketing, personal finance, financial markets and cryptocurrencies.\n\nUnick Forex\u2019s assets blocked by court\n\nSubsequently, the Sao Paulo Court of Justice reportedly ordered to block the assets managed by Unick Forex, granting an urgent injunction request to a client that complained about delay withdrawals from the platform. According to a court order published on Oct. 3, Unick Forex is free to appeal the decision.\n\nUnick Forex was previously ordered to pay $28,500 to a client who filed a lawsuit against the company for a delay in platform withdrawals.\n\nLeaked: GBB CEO owns 25,000 Bitcoin\n\nAlso this week, Cointelegraph Brasil reported that the CEO of Brazilian cryptocurrency firm Grupo Bitcoin Banco (GBB) claimed 25,000 Bitcoin (BTC), worth $196 million at press time, in a 2018 filing with the Department of Federal Revenue in 2019.\n\nAs suggested by legal experts, CEO Claudio Oliveira\u2019s personal funds could potentially be used to cover the GBB\u2019s debt to its customers.
