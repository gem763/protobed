In most of the city-state, particularly the glitzy Monte Carlo district, the wealth was evident. Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Range Rovers, BMWs, and other high-end cars were everywhere I looked. Seemingly every woman I saw was carrying a designer handbag, whether it was Chanel, Louis Vuitton, or the elusive but even more esteemed Goyard.\n\nDuring my time in Monaco, I felt out of place, keenly aware that I was neither a millionaire nor a VIP guest of the yacht show. I found much of the city to be ugly and unappealing. But there was one neighborhood I found to be laid-back, charming, and beautiful: Monaco's unassuming historical quarter.\n\nMonaco's old town was quiet, charming, and laid-back\n\nPerched on a hill overlooking a port full of superyachts, Monaco's old town is home to the 18th-century Prince's Palace of Monaco, the official residence of the royal family.\n\nThe glossy towers and drab, densely packed high-rises that I found to be so ugly elsewhere in the city were nowhere in sight. Instead, the French and Italian architecture and medieval elements in old town made me feel like I was stepping back in time. The colorful, narrow streets, ice cream shops, museums, and casual restaurants had a charming and relaxed vibe.\n\nThe Prince's Palace of Monaco. Katie Warren/Business Insider\n\nThe crowd in old town was also noticeably different than elsewhere in Monaco.\n\nThere were tourists, of course \u2014mainly clustered around the Prince's Palace \u2014but most of the locals seemed to be regular people rather than millionaires decked out in designer duds.\n\nAll in all, I found Monaco's old town to be much more down to earth and charming than the rest of the city. It reminded me of nearby Nice, France, a city that's a 20-minute train ride away and much prettier than Monaco, in my opinion.\n\nWhile I wouldn't necessarily be the first person to recommend a visit to Monaco, for those who make the trip, the old town is a must-see.", "description": "Monaco's old town, with its colorful, narrow streets, ice cream shops, museums, and casual restaurants, was charming and laid-back.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db7131adee0196d723d85b9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
