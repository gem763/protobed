Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nLast week, a number of media organizations, including the New York Times, CNN and Politico, ran reports saying Clinton told the podcast \u201cCampaign HQ with David Plouffe\u201d that Russians were \u201cgrooming\u201d a female Democratic candidate \u2014 widely assumed to be Gabbard \u2014 for a third-party run to play a potential spoiler in the 2020 election.\n\nBut apparently Clinton meant Republicans \u2014 not Russians \u2014 were doing the grooming.\n\nThe New York Times ran this correction Wednesday night: \u201cAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly an element of Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent comments about Representative Tulsi Gabbard. While Mrs. Clinton said that a Democratic presidential candidate was \u2018the favorite of the Russians,\u2019 and an aide later confirmed the reference was to Ms. Gabbard, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remark about the \u2018grooming\u2019 of a third-party candidate in the 2020 race was in response to a question about the Republicans\u2019 strategy, not about Russian intervention.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press said: \u201cIn a story Oct. 18 about Tulsi Gabbard and Hillary Clinton, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Hillary Clinton said she believes the Russians have \u2018got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u2019 She was referring to Republicans, not Russians, according to an aide.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear Wednesday night how so many news reports misunderstood Clinton\u2019s quote, or why it took so long to clarify the remarks.\n\nEither way, Clinton\u2019s comments were still a slam on Gabbard, who she referred to as \u201ca favorite of the Russians.\u201d Clinton also called former Green Party candidate Jill Stein \u201ca Russian asset.\u201d\n\nThe reports last week sparked a furious response from Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat, who in a tweet called Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full quote from the podcast:\n\nPlouffe: \u201cSo [Trump\u2019s] gonna try and drive the people not to vote for him but just to say, \u2018you know, you can\u2019t vote for them either.\u2019 And that seems to be, I think, to the extent that I can devine a strategy, their key strategy right now.\u201d\n\nClinton: \u201cWell, I think there\u2019s gonna be two parts and I think it\u2019s gonna be the same as 2016: \u2018Don\u2019t vote for the other guy. You don\u2019t like me? Don\u2019t vote for the other guy because the other guy is gonna do X, Y and Z or the other guy did such terrible things and I\u2019m gonna show you in these, you know, flashing videos that appear and then disappear and they\u2019re on the dark web, and nobody can find them, but you\u2019re gonna see them and you\u2019re gonna see that person do these horrible things.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also gonna do third party again. And I\u2019m not making any predictions but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far, and that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up. Which she might not, \u2018cause she\u2019s also a Russian asset.\u201d", "description": "In a curious turn of events, a number of major news organizations ran corrections Wednesday night over week-old reports that sparked a testy war of words...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT654_gabbar_ZG_20191019150959.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
