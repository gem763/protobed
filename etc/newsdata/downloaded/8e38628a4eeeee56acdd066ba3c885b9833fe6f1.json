It was reported as the world\u2019s attention is on the southern African nation and the upcoming burial of former leader Robert Mugabe.\n\nMagombeyi sent a message Saturday night alerting colleagues that three unidentified men were forcibly taking him away, said Masimba Ndoro, vice president of the association, which represents hundreds of newly qualified doctors who are doing their residencies.\n\n\u201cEfforts to locate him have been unsuccessful since then. We demand to know his whereabouts, we demand his release,\u201d Ndoro said.\n\nPolice spokesman Paul Nyathi said he was yet to receive details of the case.\n\nMagombeyi had complained of the poor state of Zimbabwe\u2019s hospitals and staffers\u2019 low salaries in interviews with several foreign journalists. The doctors, who earn less than $40 a month, are demanding a review of their salaries and allowances.\n\nAbout two dozen doctors gathered at Parirenyatwa Hospital in the capital, Harare, where they sang and chanted slogans denouncing Magombeyi\u2019s abduction and demanding his release.\n\n\u201cAbductions will not work,\u201d read one placard. \u201cFree Dr Magombeyi unharmed now,\u201d demanded another and a third said \u201cNo Peter, No Negotiation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur homes and workplaces are no longer safe. We don\u2019t know who will be taken next so we will not go to work until our safety is guaranteed. Right now, we are vulnerable,\u201d said Tapiwa Mungofa, another of the association\u2019s leaders.\n\n___\n\nThis version corrects the name of the other association leader to Tapiwa Mungofa.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A group of Zimbabwean doctors marched at the country's biggest hospital Sunday, demanding the release of one of their leaders who they say was abducted after calling for a pay strike.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Farai Mutsaka"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/zimbabwe_abduction_40401_c0-241-5760-3599_s1770x1032.jpg?5744a6e428d626295d3fe14d6d300f488e16a9a8", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
