He, at that time, did not just talk big, he talked huge. As well he might. Since its launch in 2010, WeWork had opened sellout sites in New York and London, and was expanding at a ferocious speed. Already, back then it was being spoken of as a $10bn (\u00a38bn) corporation.\n\nNeumann, tall with jet black, wavy hair and a pumped-up physique, cut a charismatic figure \u2013 he was deliberately messianic in image and the way he talked. At 36, he wasn\u2019t just providing his clients with desks, where they could plot their own tech and creative ideas, he was speaking about transforming the entire global office culture, offering a whole new work-life balance. Said Neumann: \u201cWe treat [tenants] the way we want to be treated ourselves. For us and them, working is about much more than achieving material goods.\u201d\n\nThey were not any old punters as such, but members. They had to apply to join, and they were vetted. \u201cNo call centres, we don\u2019t want people who will just man phones and sell.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWeWork was on a mission. Millennials, Neumann declared, \u201cswitch nine jobs on average. What we\u2019re doing is helping them find what they love doing\u201d. He continued: \u201cDo you know that in the US, 35 per cent of all workers are independent workers. That\u2019s 45 million people. And it will rise to 40-42 per cent by 2020. In London, currently, it\u2019s 30 per cent, but the trend is in the same direction. More and more people are working for themselves. Why? Because they want to do something more meaningful.\u201d\n\nHis objective, he said, seriously, was \u201cto change the world. Are we going to fulfil that potential? I don\u2019t know, but I do know we\u2019ve got a spectacular business model\u201d. Today, Neumann is out of that business. He\u2019s been ousted, and an IPO, valuing WeWork at $47bn, has been canned.\n\nPotential investors took fright at that valuation figure, and they were further spooked by Neumann\u2019s management style and governance issues. It was revealed that the hippyish, right-on, non-materialistic boss had taken $700m out of the company before the IPO. They were also unimpressed with shares being divided into two classes, aimed at giving Neumann and his associates total control even after the IPO.\n\nThere were reports of marijuana smoking on the company private jet, and business meetings fuelled by tequila shots. His successors appointed to sort out the mess are reportedly planning substantial job cuts and other cost-saving measures, including the sale of that $60m jet bought last year, as they try to stem WeWork\u2019s massive losses \u2013 $3bn over the past three years alone.\n\nChris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein and Co, reckons the figures are so bad that the company could run out of money some time after the first quarter of 2020. Among the other disclosures was that Neumann was talking about trying to make himself immortal. To be fair, he did not mention it when we met. He was full of enthusiasm, though, for his concept, anxious to show off the detail: how WeWork customers, sorry members, had access to well-appointed bars, cafes, breakout areas furnished with comfy sofas, meeting rooms, IT support and more, as well as their own desks of course, in return for rent. It was more trendy Soho House than bog-standard office block.\n\nThat, however, was also the point. What WeWork was actually supplying was not unique. Indeed, Soho House, while not promoting itself as a shared workspace, did allow members to work on their laptops at its tables. But not just Soho House. Anyone could get hold of an old office building, strip it down, give it a makeover, install cabling, cool desks and chairs, beer fridges and a barista machine, and they would get close to replicating the WeWork style. Similarly, any coffee bar or pub lounge could also allow clientele to use their laptops.\n\nSure enough, in the short time since I saw Neumann, rival shared workspace facilities have sprung up all over. Walk along any high street and you will see people galore hunched over their laptops in bars, encouraged by the owners, while former offices are also busy promoting shared working.\n\nNeumann was anxious his brand should be seen as a tech disruptor star, and enjoy the high ratings attached to that label, rather than as a traditional property play \u2013 and a not-very-good, easily replicated one at that. WeWork, he insisted, was not just about renting out square footage, but about \u201cmeeting the needs of like-minded individuals, creating a community that they can feel part of\u201d.\n\nHe accepted, begrudgingly, there was nothing to stop me finding a building and trying to do the same. But he claimed, I would not be able to match WeWork\u2019s scale, and I would lack what Neumann termed its \u201csecret weapon \u2013 we know how to provide exactly the right culture\u201d.\n\nPeople, he said, had \u201ca choice. They can stay at home and work from there, from a study. Or they can come into WeWork and be surrounded by people they can talk to, who can help them, who they can bounce ideas off.\u201d\n\nNo matter how bold or idealistic his patter, cut it away, and you find a straightforward property company. Despite Neumann\u2019s boasts, WeWork is not special. The IPO found his brand cast into an unknown, unforgiving, less understanding territory, of explaining to would-be shareholders the underlying financials. They\u2019re interested in the return they can expect, and are not moved by airy-fairy talk about creating communities and changing the world.\n\nWhat drives investors is performance. And this, without the lurid details of management excess. Neumann may have to focus on trying to be immortal; since, as far as running a publicly listed company is concerned, he is very much over.", "description": "Four years ago, I met Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, the shared workspace company.
