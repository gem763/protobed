Kamala Harris is demanding that Trump\u2019s Twitter account be suspended.\n\nA half-century ago liberals pretended to be supporters of free speech, but now they are its biggest enemy. \u201cHis Twitter account should be suspended,\u201d Democratic presidential wannabe Kamala Harris told CNN on Monday.\n\n\u201cI think there is plenty of new evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people. And so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him,\u201d she added.\n\nCensorship is central to the liberal playbook to try to regain power, and then reshape America as the Far Left wants. Harris is echoing the views of Big Tech in California, which already seems to censor ordinary Americans expressing conservative views.\n\nJoe Biden just took that liberal censorship a step further by demanding that television networks refuse to allow Rudy Giuliani to speak in favor of Trump anymore. Even the leftwing Daily Beast admits that \u201crarely, if ever, has one campaign made an affirmative demand that a top aide to a rival candidate no longer be given a platform,\" as Biden desperately insists.\n\nGiuliani tweeted in response, \u201cThink of the Biden arrogance and entitlement to protection. They believe they own the media and they are demanding that they silence me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know I have incriminating facts, not hearsay, because they know what they did in selling Joe\u2019s office to a Ukrainian crook,\u201d he added in reference to Biden, who has the most to lose in this brouhaha.\n\nPresident Trump released the transcript of his phone call with the President of Ukraine, and yet Joe Biden continues to hide behind the concealment of transcripts of his conversations with Ukraine officials during which he may have improperly intervened on behalf of his son Hunter.\n\nThe Republican National Committee has called on Biden to release his call transcripts, so that the public can decide for itself how Biden misused his position of power for financial gain for his family. But there is no transparency by the Left while it demands answers by others.\n\nUkraine, which has been independent for more than a quarter century, should no longer be referred to as \u201cthe Ukraine\u201d as though it were still a vassal state of the communist Soviet Union. Ukraine\u2019s president has fully exonerated President Trump amid the false accusations by House Democrats.\n\nBut Trump is receiving less due process and constitutional rights here at home. \u201cLike every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u2018Whistleblower,\u2019 represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment in the Bill of Rights guarantees the basic right of an accused to confront someone who makes accusations against him. Yet Trump is being denied this fundamental right while the Deep State circles its wagons to attain its goal of bringing down the president.\n\nIt does not matter to the Trump haters that a nothing-burger is at the center of this phony scandal. In this power struggle, Trump\u2019s enemies care little about what the facts are, and instead try to use the process to swing public opinion in their direction.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s political base remains rock solid, and smears from the Left are not going to alienate his longtime supporters. Trump himself shows no signs of backing down, and he is often at his best when under political attack.\n\nThe liberal Democrats have given Trump the means by which he can galvanize the American people, who are already fed up with the inside-the-Beltway mentality that prevails in the halls of Congress. Trump tweeted out a map of American counties which voted for him in 2016, and it is a massive sea of red showing his broad support.\n\nYet little can stop the insatiable desire of a lynch mob, which is what House Democrats have become. Ironically the biggest victim of their renewed witch hunt may be the only person thought to have a chance to defeat Trump next year: Joe Biden.\n\nBiden\u2019s political fortunes are being badly sullied by the mud that splatters backward onto him. It is a sign of desperation that his campaign feels the need to censor Rudy Giuliani on television, lest he embarrass Biden further with revelations about Biden\u2019s misconduct in connection with Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani is making up for all his prior missteps in fending off the same sharks who previously circled Trump for prior non-issues. Censorship of one\u2019s political opponents is not something Trump would ever do, but his Democratic rivals think that censorship is the only way they can win.\n\nJohn and Andy Schlafly are sons of Phyllis Schlafly (1924-2016) and lead the continuing Phyllis Schlafly Eagles organizations with writing and policy work.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates are trying to censor President Trump and .10/02/2019 8:47:04AM EST.", "authors": ["John", "Andy Schlafly", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/502723a6-7627-4299-9563-e156bae92961.png"}
