More plea hearings are scheduled for October 21 and November 26.\n\nUnidentified La Vernia High School students - who were juveniles at the time - got five years probation, deferred adjudication with community service this week after no contest plea\n\nIn June 2017, a total of 13 male athletes were accused of using deodorant bottles, cardboard rods, flashlights, soda bottles, pipes, and a baseball bat to sodomize young boys\n\nThere were some of six adults and seven juvenile accused of assaulting at least 10 football, baseball and basketball players. One child's admission about being sexually assaulted in a bathroom prompted others to come forward.\n\nOne victim's parent said at the time: 'They hold them down and stick various items up their rectum... including coke bottles, deodorant bottles, steel pipes, baseball bats and broomsticks.'\n\nParents were informed by police in March 2017 that their sons may have been victims. One parent told The Daily Beast that when she asked cops what the alleged assailants used on her son they told her: 'I'd rather not tell you. You don't want to know.'\n\nAs the court battle continued, many of the student athletes accused were free on bail and still lived near their alleged victims.\n\nThe mother of one victim said that in the past two years she had even seen some of the suspects in the 1,200-person town's grocery store.\n\n'I'm still angry about the whole thing and I want them to pay for what they did,' the unidentified mother of an accuser told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. 'It was very upsetting to me that everything seemed to disappear and was forgotten. There's so much corruption and drama there.'\n\nThe mother said about her son: 'He doesn't like to talk about it.'\n\nOne Friday, an attorney for one of the teens accused said he and his client were 'happy to put this behind us'.\n\nLa Vernia police said the hazing primarily involved the La Vernia Bears football team\n\nA baseball bat was said to be used to sodomize a younger student. Police said the baseball team was involved in the 'hazing' to a lesser degree\n\nWeidner, Roberts, John Rutkowski, 18, and an unnamed minor were allegedly involved in an incident where a 15-year-old was sodomized by the basketball players with a flashlight in February 2017.\n\nOther students involved in the large investigation are football players Ibarra, Dustin Norman, 18; and Robert Olivarez Jr., 17, who allegedly sodomized a 16-year-old teammate with the threaded end of a carbon dioxide tank to initiate the minor into the varsity team, according to police.\n\nThey were arrested in March 2017.\n\nThe Texas Rangers took over the case on April 3 to ensure impartially as most of the suspects and victims involved in the case know the local law enforcement agents\n\nA 15-year-old was allegedly sodomized by the basketball players with a flashlight in February 2017\n\nTwo families have filed civil lawsuits against the school district and claim that coaches 'turned a blind eye' to what was going on and 'sanctioned these rituals'.\n\nIn the suit, the victim, identified as Child Doe, claims to have been sexually assaulted when he was 15 years old and had just been bumped up from the junior varsity team to the varsity football team, when he was told to 'get ready' by upperclassman teammates.\n\nA short time afterwards, three older students allegedly forced him to the ground and forced a Gatorade bottle inside his anus over his shorts inside the locker room.\n\nThroughout the academic school year of 2015-2016, the victim claims he was harassed and bullied multiple times by the upperclassman on the football team.\n\nThe following year, the minor also claims to have been sexually assaulted by senior members of the varsity team, this time with a cardboard tube from a coat hanger.\n\nThat claim against coaches from an April 2017 filing was backed by a January 2018 lawsuit that claims a coach ignored a victim 'screaming and yelling as loud as he could' during two assaults. That lawsuit claims the victim was raped more than 30 times in five months on the school premises and at homes of fellow athletes.\n\nIn June, (left to right) Alejandro Ibarra, Dustin Norman, Colton Weidner, and Christian 'Brock' Roberts - who were 18 at the time of the accusations - were indicted for engaging in organized criminal activity\n\nLocal police have said that the hazing included members from the school's football, baseball and basketball programs and could have started in the 2014-2015 school year.\n\nLa Vernia police said the hazing primarily involved the football team at the school, and the basketball and baseball teams were involved to a lesser degree.\n\nThe civil cases have been consolidated and will go to trial in February 2020.\n\n'Our client is relieved that the truth has finally surfaced and that the community can begin the healing process,' said Rodriguez.\n\n'These past two years have been very difficult for our client, who was ostracized by his classmates at the high school and considered to be a 'snitch' for standing up against the misplaced culture to the point that he had to transfer schools.'", "description": "Four juvenile Texas high school athletes pleaded no contest on Friday after were accused as part of a group of 13 who allegedly sodomized La Vernia High School teammates during hazing rituals until 2017.", "authors": ["Leah Reid For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19447088-0-image-a-4_1570545589297.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
