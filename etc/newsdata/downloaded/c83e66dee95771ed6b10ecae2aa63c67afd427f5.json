Young people are the army politically, which has arrived in the United States. You put a spotlight on this issue in a way that it has never been before, and that is creating a new X factor.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease save your praise. We don\u2019t want it,\u201d Thunberg replied. \u201cDon\u2019t invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it because it doesn\u2019t lead to anything. I know you are trying, but just not hard enough. Sorry.\u201d\n\nThunberg emphasised that lawmakers should be looking to scientists for ways to best address the climate crisis.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump\u2019s long-term plan to destroy Obama\u2019s green legacy\n\nTo highlight this point, she sent congress the IPCC\u2019s 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C, with eight sentences of her own, rather than submit the personal statement customary at such testimonies.\n\n\u201cI am submitting this report as my testimony because I don\u2019t want you to listen to me,\u201d she wrote. \u201dI want you to listen to the scientists. And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take action.\n\nThose lawmakers gathered at the packed testimony were among the most ardent supporters of climate action in congress, but they have struggled to pass meaningful legislation in a senate controlled by Republicans.\n\nPerhaps surprised by the bluntness of Thunberg\u2019s accusation that they were not doing enough to address the climate crisis, some politicians reportedly laughed while others applauded. Mr Markey vowed that those in attendance would ensure climate change was placed at the heart of US politics.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6086415663001\n\nGreta Thunberg explains why she chose not to fly to US\n\n\u201cWe hear you,\u201d Mr Markey responded, vowing that lawmakers \u201cwill redouble our efforts to make sure that we inject this issue into the politics of this building and this country because time is running out.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Thunberg, a number of youth activists from across the Americas were invited to address the task force in an attempt to build momentum for serious climate action in the run-up to a week of global climate strikes beginning on Friday.\n\nThere will be 4,638 events in 139 countries, Thunberg said. In New York City, children will not be penalised for skipping school, while in Australia, the government of Victoria has encouraged people to strike.\n\n\"We want our kids to be engaged in the world around them, so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to criticise students for holding a peaceful protest about an issue as important as this,\u201d a government spokesperson said. \"We should celebrate the fact they care enough to want to do something about it.\"\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Trump\u2019s long-term plan to destroy Obama\u2019s green legacy", "description": "Former US president Barack Obama met with teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg on Monday, describing her as \u201cone of the planet\u2019s greatest advocates\u201d.The pair discussed the school strikes for which Thunberg achieved fame, with the Swedish activist praising the enthusiasm of the schoolchildren who gathered", "authors": ["Andy Gregory"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ESSK4TBinglc77_mMjjw1Q--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/d43bb7a0d308a6a42a26e902fe65cf0e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
