I think sometimes you've been telling a story a long time -- it grows. I've done it ... you tell a story and it's like 'Oh, you know what and remember that happened too?' And then suddenly you were marching up the hill, and then you brought all the kids, and then you had your own baby, and you delivered it yourself,\" she said.\n\nWhen Hostin responded, she said it was \"unfortunate\" that people were making Biden's comments an \"issue of mental clarity as opposed to someone who is just trying to be a good storyteller.\"\n\nThe hosts also took turns comparing Biden to President Trump, whom they claimed was much worse.\n\n\"If he was running against Abraham Lincoln, he'd have an issue,\" co-host Joy Behar commented, \"but he's not.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarlier in the segment, Behar also said Biden looked like the theoretical physicist Albert Einstein compared to Trump.\n\n\"Compared to Trump who thinks Frederick Douglass is alive and who looks directly into the sun during an eclipse -- this guy is like Albert Einstein.\"\n\nBehar added that Biden was like \"teflon\" in that people continued supporting him despite his gaffes. When co-host Abby Huntsman pointed out that Trump supporters said the same about the president, Behar predicted that his approval rating would decline when \"the recession comes.\"", "description": "\"View\" co-hosts Sunny Hostin and Whoopi Goldberg pushed back on the idea that former Vice President Joe Biden wasn't sharp mentally or that he lied when he bungled a military story he told on the campaign trail.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
