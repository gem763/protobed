The Supreme Court is involved, the public is divided, and entertainers are seemingly getting screwed. But who really owns a meme?\n\nFor the answer to that question we turned to legal experts and the ghost of a dancing celebrity from the 1930s.\n\nPart of the problem with meme-related lawsuits is that there\u2019s no precedent for copyright or intellectual property (IP) suits concerning them. Another part is that memes \u2013 specifically those that imitate movements made popular through viral videos or celebrities \u2013 don\u2019t appear to qualify for copyright protection.\n\nThere\u2019s no copyright to infringe on\n\nThere are basically only two types of cases concerning alleged intellectual property infringement through appropriation of dance moves that appear as popular memes: claims of copyright infringement and claims of unauthorized use of personal likeness. Unfortunately for the entertainers suing game companies, none of the individuals bringing lawsuits forth actually applied for and received copyrights for their intellectual property beforehand.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known case is that of Alfonso Ribeiro, the actor who played Carlton on the seminal 1990s TV show \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\u201d His Carlton Dance, made famous decades before Fortnite was created, is just as recognizable to fans as the opening lyrics of the tv show. But Ribeiro\u2019s had to suspend his lawsuit after the US Copyright Office refused to issue a copyright for his work.\n\nSo is Epic\u2019s use of the Carlton Dance the equivalent of copyright infringement or IP theft? The short answer is that it probably isn\u2019t, at least, according to the letter of the current law.\n\nTNW spoke to legal document assistant and certified paralegal Carla Navarro, founder of Legal Form Solution, who told us:\n\nDoes a single, repetitive dance move constitute intellectual property? No. Copyright law says that any body of work that is protected must be an original creation that has been memorialized in a tangible form. One dance step is not considered a creative body of work, because it is not enough material to cover. According to The Copyright Act section 102(a)(4), \u201c[\u2026] Choreography is the composition and arrangement of a related series of dance movements and patterns organized into a coherent whole. [\u2026] Choreography and pantomimes consisting of ordinary motor activities, social dances, commonplace movements or gestures, or athletic movements may lack a sufficient amount of authorship to qualify for copyright protection.\u201d Individual movements or dance steps by themselves are not copyrightable.\n\nWorse, for Ribeiro\u2018s case, there\u2019s plenty of non meme-related precedent for the courts to handle infringement of trademark, copyright, or intellectual property theft when it come to dance moves. Michael Jackson popularized many dance moves but none of them are copyrighted (though he did patent a shoe).\n\nHis most famous dance move, the moonwalk, really wasn\u2019t even his. See for yourself in this video from 1932 featuring Cab Calloway:\n\nOther celebrities performed similar moves throughout the years, including Judy Garland and Johnny Carson \u2013 all before Jackson debuted the dance in 1983. Again: US law says you can copyright complete choreography, but not a few repetitive movements strung together as a dance.\n\nTNW asked Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University School of Law who specializes in advertising and IP law, whether he thought Ribeiro\u2019s case was likely to end in success. He told us:\n\nThe Copyright Office refused his registration, so he will either have to persuade them otherwise or sue without the benefit of the registration (which will likely cause the Copyright Office to enter the litigation). So I\u2019ve assumed that the lawsuit is functionally dead, despite the rhetoric.\n\nWhat about unauthorized use of a person\u2019s likeness\n\nIn the case of Ribeiro versus Epic Games, copyright law isn\u2019t on the former\u2019s side \u2014 especially considering he\u2019s on the record claiming he created the dance by imitating Eddie Murphy and Courteney Cox. If it\u2019s on his lawyers to convince the courts that he\u2019s the sole creator of the moves and that they constitute a fully choreographed dance worthy of being considered intellectual property, he may be forced to consider a different route.\n\nAnd that just leaves cases like musician Leo Pellegrino\u2019s. He\u2019s suing Epic over its use of what he considers his iconic saxophone playing style. Rather than pursue infringement of copyright \u2014 which, like Ribeiro, he doesn\u2019t have \u2014 he\u2019s suing for unauthorized use of his personal likeness.\n\nAccording to The Verge\u2019s Nick Statt:\n\nPart of the claim appears to be that Pellegrino uses \u201coutward pointing feet\u201d while playing and that his other signature is \u201chis love of putting on energetic performances playing the saxophone.\u201d\n\nIs that even enough to constitute intellectual property theft or unauthorized use of personal likeness? Judge for yourself:\n\nWe asked Goldman if he had any thoughts on Pellegrino\u2019s case:\n\nThat lawsuit has no chance of success. That suit doesn\u2019t claim copyright infringement. Instead, it tries to fit the claim into publicity rights and trademark law. But neither law protects a \u201csignature move,\u201d especially not in the circumstances that Pellegrino is claiming. Pellegrino will be lucky if he doesn\u2019t have to write a check to cover Epic\u2019s defense costs.\n\nBad news for meme creators\n\nNavarro told TNW she doesn\u2019t think cases like these will get very far (at least not for the entertainers suing), but they could \u201cset forth case law that could be damaging to artistic expression.\u201d If the courts don\u2019t rule in favor of Pellegrino, or other entertainers suing for non-copyright claims related to their creation of a meme, then the precedent will dictate that meme creators without copyrights have no ownership \u2014 something that could limit earning potential for those who go viral.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for meme creators to recognize that viral fame doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to money in the pockets of those who, for lack of a better way of putting it, most deserve the credit. As Georgetown legal professor Jonathan Band told OneZero:\n\nIn the olden days, you created content, you sold content, and that\u2019s how you made your money. Now you create content and find other ways to make your money.\n\nAfter all, Cab Calloway never saw a cent of Michael Jackson\u2019s $236 million dollar estate. It\u2019s hard to imagine that Ribeiro or Pellegrino are legally entitled to any of Fortnite\u2018s $2.4 billion in profits and counting. It\u2019s still up to the courts to decide, as long as there are open cases, but future meme creators should probably consider obtaining a copyright before their work goes viral instead of a lawyer after.\n\nRead next: Sony announces Death Stranding release date in bizarre Twitch stream", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F05%2Fcarltondance.jpg&signature=f73a80c6af9b20ab65834eabef7dd03c", "published_at": "2019-05-29"}
