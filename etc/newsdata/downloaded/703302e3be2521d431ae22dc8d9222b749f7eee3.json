A score of 50 indicates no change, while above 50 shows growth and below 50 indicates contraction. The further from the 50-median, the faster the pace of growth or decline.\n\nOther factors such as lower new orders, input prices and average wages also pulled the headline index lower in September.\n\nOne hopeful sign was in detached house-building. The pace of decline slowed as that sector's activity sub-index rose 2.3 points to 46.2, marking six months of pick-up from March's six-and-a-half-year low. New orders also rose 2.4 points to 44.2.\n\n\"Both the activity and new orders indexes in house building recorded further increases in September suggesting the pace of decline in this part of the industry at least has eased noticeably over recent months,\" said Peter Burn, head of policy at Ai Group, which produces the monthly index with the Housing Industry Association.", "description": "The decline in house-building eased in September even as apartments and engineering work contracted at a faster rate, collectively pulling the construction industry into its 13th straight month of decline, the latest Performance of Construction Index shows.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d8d3173d0d05dbc0150a4d4c6208766f8a2c955d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
