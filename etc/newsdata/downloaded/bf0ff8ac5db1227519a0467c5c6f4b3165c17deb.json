He either needs to go away or fight, and it\u2019s me or Dustin.\"\n\nHe added: \"I wrote him a message like f**king seven months ago just trying to be his friend.\n\n\"I\u2019ve tried every route. I\u2019m trying reverse psychology. I\u2019m trying to be his friend.\n\n\"I\u2019m trying every f**king route that there is to draw this man out. And I can't draw him out.\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\n\"And he\u2019s calling out Frankie Edgar. So, it\u2019s a slap in the face to me, to other lightweights, and to really the standard that we do here.\"\n\nMcGregor said in August he had been calling out Gaethje for a fight in July, but had to shelve those plans after suffering a hand injury in a sparring session.\n\nPoirier this week claimed he is fighting McGregor next , while the Dubliner's trainer John Kavanagh last week suggested Edgar would be the perfect comeback opponent for his fighter.\n\nMcGregor has not fought since he was choked out by lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov last October.", "description": "American says he has been trying to draw out McGregor for UFC return for months without success", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images", "Zuffa Llc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20048148.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1167451686.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
