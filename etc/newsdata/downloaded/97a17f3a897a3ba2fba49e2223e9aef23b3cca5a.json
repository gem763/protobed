Magouirk was stabbed at least seven times and Syren was stabbed at least nine times. Afterwards, Crutsinger stole Syren's car and credit card. He was found three days later 300 miles away in a bar in Galveston. DNA tied Crutsinger to the crime and he confessed.\n\nHis defense attorney had argued that he had a history of alcoholism and became violent when drunk. But in her petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to try to stop the execution his current attorney, Lydia Brandt, said the jury heard nothing about his life that might explain in his alcoholism in relation to the murders.\n\nShe also insisted that Crutsinger had been represented on the appellate level by an incompetent attorney. The Supreme Court declined to intervene.\n\nCrutsinger was the fifth inmate executed in Texas this year and 10 more are scheduled by the end of the year. Overall, 14 inmates have been executed in the U.S. this year.", "description": "Billy Jack Crutsinger, 64, was the 14th inmate executed in the U.S. this year and the fifth in Texas.
