He\u2019s even recycling his urine\n\n\u2018I have a lot of piss,\u201d says Gavin Turk. He\u2019s going to need it. He shows me a drink can he\u2019s made from silver bearing the label \u201cartist\u2019s piss\u201d in several languages as we stand in his studio, fittingly located in Canning Town, London.\n\nTurk is planning to fill as many cans like this with his own urine as necessary \u2013 in order to buy, well, a can of excrement made by his hero, the late Piero Manzoni. Before his untimely death aged 29 in 1961, Manzoni \u2013 or so art world orthodoxy has it \u2013 filled 90 tin cans with his own ordure, sealing and labelling it \u201cMerda d\u2019Artista\u201d.\n\nA facsimile of Merda d\u2019Artista by 1960s Italian artist Piero Manzoni. Photograph: Mazzoleni Art\n\nIn 2012, Christie\u2019s auctioned number 12 , expecting it to sell for \u00a340-60,000. Instead, it went for \u00a3103,250. \u201cThey\u2019d probably fetch \u00a3200,000 now,\u201d says Turk. So you\u2019d better get to work. \u201cI already have,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m storing samples in plastic bottles upstairs.\u201d\n\nTurk has no idea how much each can will sell for, nor who might buy it, though he does have a roster of possible collectors, including fellow Young British Artist (YBA) Damien Hirst. Perhaps Deutsche Bank, who already have a collection of Turk\u2019s drawings on display at their Frankfurt HQ, might like some Piscia d\u2019Artista for the foyer.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping to do,\u201d sums up Turk, \u201cis convert piss into shit.\u201d The artist has, after all, been an alchemist for three decades now, making art from bin bags, apple cores, flat tyres, cardboard boxes, spent matches and other detritus cast in bronze and meticulously painted. He even made cufflinks in resin and 24-carat gold modelled on spat-out chewing gum. Then there was the crushed Transit Van that was the subject of last year\u2019s A Brexit Portfolio and Other Transit Disasters, in which he produced silkscreen images riffing on Andy Warhol\u2019s car crash canvases.\n\n\u201cWe are what we throw away,\u201d says the man the Financial Times recently called the laureate of waste. For his new exhibition, Letting Go, Turk has picked up around 500 bottles from the streets of London and put rows of them in plywood cases that will be displayed in the windows of the Reflex gallery in Amsterdam. Inside, visitors will be able to see watercolour paintings of crushed water bottles, a pair of bronze cast flattened bottles \u2013 one called Pet, the other Pete, both with an \u00a38,500 asking price. \u201cSomeone posted on Instagram, \u2018I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d spend \u00a38,500 on a discarded bottle,\u2019\u201d laughs Turk. Naive: like much of Turk\u2019s art, it\u2019s likely to be a good investment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Water Bottle Bottle by Gavin Turk. Photograph: Gavin Turk/Reflexamsterdam.com\n\nBut there is a political dimension to the work. As his gallery statement puts it: \u201cThe demand in the ironic symbolic purity of water is causing our oceans to be filled with microplastics. PET plastic is highly recyclable, yet big companies believe that consumers would not buy a slightly murky or imperfect bottle. So instead, 93% of all plastic water bottles are newly formed.\u201d\n\nI have a method. I might drink some water before I go out, and when I get there, I might drink some more\n\nHe tells me: \u201cThe thing about these bottles is that they\u2019ve become so socially unacceptable they\u2019re going to disappear. At which point, my collection will become valuable.\u201d So how do you carry your water, if you\u2019re so clever? \u201cI have a method,\u201d says Turk. \u201cYou see, I might drink some water before I go out, and when I get there, I might drink some more.\u201d It could catch on.\n\nThe 52-year-old has long been an artist of nothing. His 1991 MA show at the Royal College of Art was called Cave, and consisted of a room empty except for an English Heritage-style blue plaque mounted in a case. It read: \u201cBorough of Kensington, Gavin Turk. Sculptor, Worked Here 1989-1991.\u201d Turk believes the RCA\u2019s then rector \u2013 Jocelyn Stevens, who was soon to become chairman of English Heritage \u2013 took offence, and he thinks that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t get a degree.\n\n\u201cI had no idea he was up for that job, so Cave had nothing to do with him. But as he was touring the show with his politician friends like David Mellor, they teased him about the blue plaque and his face went like that shot in Jaws when the shark\u2019s mouth opens really, really wide.\u201d Turk demonstrates and I see right down his throat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pop, 1993 \u2026 Gavin Turk as Sid Vicious. Photograph: Gavin Turk, Live Stock Market.\n\nBut failure allowed Turk to burnish his credentials as what the mild-mannered Guildford-born artist never was really: a YBA bad boy, the Sid Vicious of conceptual art. He actually depicted himself as Vicious in a life-sized waxwork and went on to cast himself in further roles, including French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat stabbed in his bathtub. He even made a waxwork of himself as Che Guevara, complete with military fatigues. It was due to be displayed in Zaha Hadid\u2019s Mind Zone at the Millennium Dome but it was pulled due to worries of upsetting its sponsor, arms manufacturer BAe-Marconi.\n\nTurk insists, however, that he had no wider agenda, saying: \u201cI just wanted a sculpture of Che in the Dome!\u201d But don\u2019t recent protests - for example, Antony Gormley speaking out against BP-sponsored exhibitions \u2013 show the art world is compromised by what some might call dirty money? \u201cI do worry about this, especially because art can be used to sanction space and detoxify brands. And art stands for values that business doesn\u2019t: it\u2019s opposed to hierarchies, for instance. But it\u2019s difficult for me because I want to keep the channels of access open, make art available as much as possible.\u201d\n\nFor the private view of Charles Saatchi\u2019s Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1997, Turk arrived dressed as a tramp. \u201cSomething amazing happened as I walked through Soho,\u201d he says. \u201cI suddenly had this space around me.\u201d Was this because of the smell? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that. I\u2019d become socially undesirable.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gavin Turk in his London studio. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nHe felt something similar one day last year when he got tapped on the shoulder by a police officer. He was lying on the street near Lambeth Bridge as part of the Extinction Rebellion protest when he was arrested. \u201cProbably because I was on the edge of the protesters, so easy to get to. I got asked to move. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t see anyone else moving.\u2019 The officer said, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to arrest you\u2019. And I said, \u2018Well OK.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey took me to Savile Row where there\u2019s a police station.\u201d I glance at Turk, admiring his three-piece suit and trilby. Handy for your tailor. \u201cSo they put me in a cell for four hours and then this inspector comes in and says, \u2018You all right, sir?\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m excruciatingly bored, but it\u2019s getting kind of interesting without anything to read or having my phone.\u2019 He said, \u2018Have you counted the tiles yet?\u2019 It was only then that I noticed his name was Inspector Wall! As soon as he closed the door on me, I started counting tiles. Of course.\u201d\n\nThe private me who got involved in Extinction Rebellion and doesn't fly and doesn't feel he ought to have a car is putting a lot of pressure on Gavin Turk the artist\n\nIs your art getting more political? \u201cArt is bound to get caught up in what\u2019s happening in the wider world. What\u2019s happening is that for a long time there were two Gavin Turks: one the artist, the other the private me. But now the private me who got involved in Extinction Rebellion and who doesn\u2019t fly and who doesn\u2019t feel he ought to have a car, is putting a lot of pressure on Gavin Turk the artist.\u201d Do you fear your art will become reductively political, even ephemeral as a result? \u201cEverything\u2019s ephemeral. And art was always something that reflects the times and becomes obsolete. Well, my art at least.\u201d\n\nSky TV is currently considering commissioning Turk to build a life-size steel blue whale to draw attention to the plastic crisis afflicting oceans. I wonder what private Gavin makes of artist Gavin doing that. Can such art change the world? \u201cProbably only incrementally, if at all.\u201d\n\nPerhaps you should stop making things, I say. There\u2019s already too much stuff in the world. \u201cMaybe I should. I know young artists working on social media. That\u2019s where their art is - in the cloud, not the real world.\u201d But now the YBA has become a MABA (Middle Aged British Artist), he can\u2019t quite make that leap into cyberspace. \u201cI\u2019m too weirded out by the idea that it\u2019s going to be lost in a power cut or something. Maybe I should stop, but I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d\n\nGavin Turk\u2019s Letting Go is at Reflex Gallery, Amsterdam, from 19 October to 6 December", "description": "The former YBA once put a plaque up to himself \u2013 but these days he\u2019s more likely to be getting locked up with Extinction Rebellion.
