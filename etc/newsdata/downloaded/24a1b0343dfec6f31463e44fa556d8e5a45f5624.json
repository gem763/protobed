(Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nA year after Hurricane Florence poured about 8 trillion gallons of water over North Carolina, Teresa Seal is still trying to rebuild.\n\nShe and her husband have been living in one upstairs room while they repair their home\u2019s ground floor, which was saturated by three feet of water in the 2018 storm. Neighbors are camped out in RVs, outside of homes unable to withstand another soaking. If Hurricane Dorian strikes, it will be this neighborhood\u2019s third major storm in three years.\n\nFor Seal, 51, Dorian is the latest confirmation that climate change may one day cause catastrophic damage to her home, but she has no interest in moving.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t feel like starting over,\u201d Seal said. \u201cI told my husband, I don\u2019t care if we have to tent out on the dirt right now \u2014 I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of attitude that North Carolina officials are combating, as climate change realism settles over this once highly skeptical state. A triple blow of devastating hurricanes \u2014 Matthew in 2016, Florence in September 2018 and Michael weeks later \u2014 has had a profound impact on thinking here. The debate is no longer about \u201cif\u201d another megastorm will come but \u201cwhen.\u201d\n\nAs a result, state leaders are attempting to shift their approach to extreme weather from reactive to proactive. Among the new strategies is an effort to buy out homeowners in neighborhoods that have been struck multiple times and move them to safer locations. The state recently established an Office of Recovery and Resiliency in part to halt the cycle of destruction and rebuilding, identifying less-vulnerable locations to move people like Seal and her neighbors before they have to be rescued by boat.\n\n\n\nHoses extend to the ocean on Wednesday in anticipation of flooding before the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Carolina Beach, N.C. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nBut here in New Bern \u2014 a river town of about 30,000 people just off North Carolina\u2019s central coast \u2014 the logistical and emotional challenges of relocating are clear.\n\nAt a recent community meeting about disaster recovery, residents asked state officials to find a way to save the Stanley White Recreation Center, which was heavily damaged by floodwaters in Hurricane Florence \u2014 but without moving it.\n\nThe only other option, officials said, is to raise the building at least 11 feet. The facility is located in a flood plain that didn\u2019t exist when it was built in the mid-1970s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a pillar of the community for over 40 years,\u201d said New Bern Alderman Barbara Best. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that it can\u2019t be rebuilt in its current location.\u201d\n\nBest said it will take a lot of public engagement by city, state and federal officials to convince residents to buy into the concept of \u201cresiliency,\u201d the steps a community takes to anticipate and quickly recover from increasingly frequent and severe weather events.\n\nMoving out of flood plains is a key component of climate resilience. But right now, Best said, residents are deeply attached to their homes and just want to get back to their neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re in a neighborhood for years and years, it\u2019s kind of hard for the city to come to them and say they can\u2019t rebuild or they have to elevate,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear that. They just don\u2019t want to move.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s new emphasis on resiliency follows 16 other states and the District of Columbia that have developed comprehensive statewide climate adaptation plans. Many of the decisions that affect resiliency are made on a local or state level, including adjusting building codes and zoning laws, regulating local utilities and upgrading storm water systems.\n\nIn southeast Florida, four counties \u2014 Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe and Palm Beach \u2014 banded together a decade ago to develop a regional \u201cclimate change compact\u201d that includes long-term planning on repairing beach erosion, creating salt- and wind-resistant urban tree canopies and increasing the use of renewable energy sources. The U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 25 governors formed in 2017 after President Trump announced he would withdraw from the Paris agreement, has extended its focus beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions to resilience, sharing states\u2019 plans for identifying their climate vulnerabilities and addressing the risks.\n\nMany advocates say more federal action is needed to mitigate the property destruction and other losses caused by the universal threat of climate change, which has no respect for state borders.\n\n\u201cSome aspects of mitigation simply work best at the federal level,\u201d said Heather Hurlburt, director of the New Models of Policy Change project at New America. \u201cBut we are seeing more action in large cities and more on the state level than the federal level.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, responsible for federal disaster response, said the agency is \u201ccommitted to building resilient communities,\u201d including setting aside 6 percent of certain disaster expenses to provide funding for reducing disaster risk. North Carolina, for instance, recently received federal funding for Hurricane Matthew recovery that included $168 million for buyouts and elevating houses like Seal\u2019s.\n\nWhile the human and financial costs of relocating communities can be huge, the broader financial considerations are compelling: A 2017 National Institute of Building Sciences report found that every $1 spent on mitigation efforts can save the nation $6 in disaster spending.\n\nIn North Carolina, a change in administrations drove the shift in focus to climate resilience. Since his election in 2016, Gov. Roy Cooper (D) has pushed a combined strategy of resilience and greenhouse gas reduction, issuing an executive order last year that requires state agencies to adopt policies that support preparing for extreme weather, instead of just responding to it.\n\nJessica Whitehead, a scientist who worked with farmers and small communities on climate change adaptation, was tapped as the state\u2019s first chief resiliency officer. The state\u2019s director of emergency management, Mike Sprayberry, said Whitehead distilled the importance of integrating emergency management and resiliency in an early conversation.\n\n\u201cShe said the best rescue is the one you don\u2019t have to make because you already moved that family out of the flood plain into good, affordable housing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state faces a daunting task in a region where affordable housing was scarce outside of the flood plains even before the storms. The new resiliency office recently announced $16.6 million to build 128 units in the inland cities of in Fayetteville and Goldsboro, but after Matthew and Florence, the deficit of affordable housing in eastern North Carolina went from 190,000 units to 300,000 units.\n\nThe office wants to find ways to better leverage federal disaster recovery funds to move residents to higher ground before the next flood. Given the region\u2019s economic struggles and the strong attachment to place in many communities, that will be a challenge, Whitehead said, but a realization is setting in that change is coming.\n\n\u201cPeople are beginning to realize that we can\u2019t put things back exactly the way that they were and expect a different result,\u201d she said.\n\nDoug Harr, executive director of Religious Community Services in New Bern, which runs a shelter and community kitchen, said that with memories of Florence still fresh, people are having a hard time with the idea of Dorian, let alone thinking further ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to have therapists in the streets if we get hit again this month,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will not deal well emotionally.\u201d\n\nFor Seal, a case worker for residents still struggling with the impacts of the storms, the ties to home outweigh the realization that extreme weather is a growing threat. With Dorian looming, Seal still believes her only option is to rebuild her home, though hopefully higher than it sits now.\n\n\u201cIf not, I guess I\u2019ll just have to build it back like it was and pray,\u201d she said.\n\nSellers reported from Washington.
