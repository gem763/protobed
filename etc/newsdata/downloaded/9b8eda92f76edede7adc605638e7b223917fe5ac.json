The Japan head Joseph backed up prop Yusuke Kizu\u2019s accusation that Ireland prop Cian Healy \u201csteps out\u201d and scrummages in at an illegal angle.\n\nIreland head coach Joe Schmidt insisted his side have one of the least penalised scrums in the Test arena in offering a frustrated response to Kizu on Thursday, insisting Healy scrummages square. But after Japan had named their team \u2013 confirming squad captain Michael Leitch\u2019s demotion to the bench \u2013 Joseph refused to back away from Kizu\u2019s comments about Ireland\u2019s scrum.\n\n\u201cI think first thing, Kizu is a young man, probably his first media experience, so that would be the first thing around Kizu-san,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up against a very strong scrum. Yes, at times they are illegal, but at all times they are a very strong scrum. We know that\u2019s a difficult part of the game, but we\u2019ve really improved our scrum and lineout recently. And it\u2019s an area we\u2019ve been focusing on all week.\u201d\n\nMatteo Minozzi seals Italy\u2019s seven-try romp over Canada at Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nHosts Japan saw off Russia 30-10 to kick-start the first World Cup in Asia, with the players admitting they had been overawed by the scale of the occasion in Tokyo. Now the Brave Blossoms will host Ireland in Shizuoka and Joseph admitted Japan will need \u201cthe game of their lives\u201d to beat Ireland.\n\nPieter Labuschagne will captain Japan from the off, with Joseph backing Leitch to have a big impact off the bench. \u201cWhat I believe around the game, in terms of our bench, we\u2019ve got to have an impact. If we\u2019re going to be in a position to win the match, it\u2019s going to come down to the last five or 10 minutes,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll need clear leadership. Michael has had an injury all year, he\u2019s only played four or five games, and he\u2019s a very key player. We have in-form players playing really well and experienced players coming on. So as a coach I get to have both things.\n\n\u201cLappies doesn\u2019t speak Japanese, he speaks English, but so does the referee. His leadership is natural, his work around the game is outstanding. I\u2019ve been impressed with him as a leader in the last two years at the Sunwolves and he is respected by the players, which is key.\u201d\n\nIn Pool C, meanwhile, Argentina have dropped the experienced pair of fly-half Nicolas Sanchez and hooker Agustin Creevy for the match aginst Tonga at the Hanazono Rugby Stadium on Saturday.\n\nThey are two of four changes made by the head coach, Mario Ledesma, from the side defeated by France in their opener, with loose-forward Javier Ortega Desio also among the replacements, and wing Ramiro Moyano out of the match-day 23 altogether.\n\nThey have been replaced in the starting XV by Julian Montoya at hooker, No 8 Tomas Lezana, fly-half Ben Urdapilleta and wing Santiago Carreras. For Urdapilleta, it is a first Argentina start since 2013 following his return to the squad this year.\n\nIn Pool B a new-look South Africa plan to adjust their strategy to a high-tempo, running game for the match against minnow neighbours Namibia at the City of Toyota Stadium on Saturday.\n\nThe Springboks have made 13 changes to their starting side for the encounter, which includes moving mobile hooker Schalk Brits to the back of the scrum in a loose trio that also includes Sevens veteran Kwagga Smith and Francois Louw.\n\nThat, along with the half-back pairing of fly-half Elton Jantjies and scrum-half Herschel Jantjies, suggests the Boks are going to look to keep the ball in hand.\n\nNamibias coach Phil Davies has made 10 changes to the Namibian starting lineup from the defeat by Italy. Against South Africa key wing Lesley Klim plays after recovering from a calf problem.", "description": "Jamie Joseph doubled down on claims that Cian Healy \u2018steps out\u2019 at a scrum despite Ireland\u2019s denials", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b048c36e8bd248b8651650cf1c90edf284b4ded9/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b91e7ab3b3c77eadc469f69628ca6ded", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
