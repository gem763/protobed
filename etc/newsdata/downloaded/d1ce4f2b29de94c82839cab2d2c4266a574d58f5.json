REUTERS/Neil Hall/Files\n\nSpot gold was up 1% at $1,503.60 per ounce, as of 0601 GMT. Prices had dipped 1.2% in the previous week on hopes that an end to the U.S.-China trade tiff could be near.\n\nU.S. gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,511.40 per ounce.\n\nThe attacks on Saudi oil installations have lead to a rotation of interests out of stocks and into safe-havens, said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.\n\nThe risk-averse sentiment in the market underpinned the bullion, often seen as an alternative investment during times of political and financial uncertainty.\n\nWith escalating tensions in the Middle East and hopes of more stimulus measures from major central banks, the next target for gold will be $1,530, Halley added.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack over the weekend on the world\u2019s biggest oil-processing facility.\n\nHowever, a senior U.S. official said that evidence indicated Tehran was behind it, and President Donald Trump said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response to the attack, souring its already strained relations with Iran.\n\nThe event hurt risk sentiment in the markets, with Asian equities trading lower at 515.4, and the safe-haven yen up 0.4% to 107.64 per dollar. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was 0.2% lower at 98.053.\n\nInvestors also await the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan\u2019s policy meetings on Wednesday, for signals on their future policy path.\n\n\u201cAccommodative monetary policy by global central banks will support bullion\u2019s appeal for 2H 2019,\u201d Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu said in a note.\n\nCentral banks globally are facing increasing pressure to dole out monetary support for flagging economies as the U.S.-China trade dispute hurt trade and business sentiment. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar.\n\nDenting risk sentiment was dismal data from China, which showed factory and consumer sectors slowed further in August, with industrial production growing at the weakest pace in 17-1/2 years, a sign of increasing weakness in an economy lashed by trade headwinds and soft domestic demand.\n\nSpot gold could retest resistance at $1,524 per ounce, as it has temporarily bottomed around a support at $1,480, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver jumped as much as 3% to $18 an ounce and platinum was up 0.5% at $953.31. Meanwhile, palladium rose 0.5% to $1,614.00 per ounce.", "description": "Gold prices jumped 1% on Monday as attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities dented risk appetite, boosting demand for the safe-haven bullion, while investors awaited for clues on monetary easing from major central bank meetings due this week.", "authors": ["Karthika Suresh Namboothiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430338282&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F08U", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
