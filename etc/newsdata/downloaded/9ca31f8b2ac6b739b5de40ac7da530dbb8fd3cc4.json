Bernie Sanders, who unveiled a sweeping wealth tax plan earlier this week that would, over the course of 15 years, halve the wealth of billionaires in the U.S. The Democratic presidential candidate vowed to implement new tax brackets on the ultra-rich, from a 1 percent tax imposed on married couples with $32 million to an 8 percent tax on those with more than $10 billion.\n\n\u201cThere is no justice when three billionaires are able to own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire country,\u201d Sanders said in a tweet.\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren has likewise hinged her presidential bid on a wealth tax, which she first introduced in January. Under her plan, individuals with $50 million would pay a 2 percent tax. That would increase to 3 percent for individuals with more than $1 billion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "Coastal states, including Florida, New York, California and Connecticut, led the way in income inequality.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
