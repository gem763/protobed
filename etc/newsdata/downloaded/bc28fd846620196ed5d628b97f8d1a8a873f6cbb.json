(The S&P 500 isn\u2019t as diversified as its name implies because the index\u2019s five largest companies \u2014 Microsoft MSFT, +1.84%, Apple AAPL, -0.81%, Amazon AMZN, +0.22%, Alphabet GOOG, +0.51% GOOGL, +0.49% and Facebook FB, +1.06% \u2014 make up 17% of the market value.)\n\nLeaving cap-weighting aside, mid-cap stocks are often overlooked, despite good performance characteristics.\n\nAmy Zhang, who manages the Alger Small Cap Focus Fund AOFAX, +0.14% (which has had an incredible performance run) launched the Alger Mid-Cap Focus Fund AFOIX, +0.00% in June. In an interview at her office in New York, she said mid-cap stocks offered \u201cthe best of both worlds,\u201d with quality \u201cclose to large-cap\u201d stocks, while the group\u2019s growth \u201cis closer to small-cap.\u201d\n\nShe also discussed, below, three of the companies held by the Alger Mid-Cap Focus Fund.\n\nCrit Thomas, global market strategist at Touchstone Investments in Cincinnati, said in a phone interview that mid-cap stocks were \u201cunder-represented\u201d in investors\u2019 portfolios as money continues to flow into large-cap index funds. He then helped to explain basic misunderstandings of the Russell 1000 Index RUI, +0.00%, which consists of the largest 1,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index RUA, -0.03%.\n\nPeople often speak of the Russell 1000 as a large-cap index, but it also includes mid-cap stocks. The largest 200 companies in the index account for 73% of the Russell 1000\u2019s market capitalization. This group is called the Russell Top 200 Index RT200, +0.08%. The remaining 800 make up the Russell Mid-Cap Index RMCC, -0.22%.\n\nHere\u2019s a 15-year comparison of total returns (with reinvested dividends) for the Russell Mid-Cap Index against the Russell Top 200 Index, the full Russell 1000 and the S&P 500:\n\nFactSet\n\nHere\u2019s a performance comparison for the indexes for different periods:\n\nIndex Total return - 2019 through Sept. 18 Average return - 3 years Average return - 5 years Average return - 10 years Average return - 15 years Average return - 20 years Russell Mid-Cap Index 23.3% 11.9% 8.7% 13.1% 10.0% 9.3% Russell Top 200 Index 21.2% 15.0% 11.0% 13.3% 8.8% 5.5% Russell 1000 Index 21.8% 14.1% 10.4% 13.2% 9.2% 6.5% S&P 500 Index 21.7% 14.3% 10.6% 13.2% 9.0% 6.2% Source: FactSet\n\nSo the mid-cap group has been the best performer for 15 and 20 years, while trailing over the past 10 years, during the post-crisis recovery and the central-bank-driven bull market.\n\nWhy mid-cap stocks now?\n\nReasons to broaden your horizons beyond large-cap stocks, which have worked so well during recent years, include lowering your risk via diversification, especially if you are worried about a significant decline for the stock market. But Thomas pointed out that better earnings growth and better expected earnings growth might also make this an excellent time to consider mid-caps.\n\nFrom a base line in calendar 2015, here are actual cumulative earnings-per-share growth figures for the Russell Mid-Cap Index and the Russell Top 200 Index through the past three full calendar years, with projected earnings growth through the next three full years, based on analysts\u2019 consensus estimates:\n\nRussell Mid-Cap Index Russell Top 200 Index 2016 3.1% -2.9% 2017 15.3% 8.1% 2018 40.9% 38.6% 2019 Estimate 61.4% 48.0% 2020 Estimate 79.1% 64.1% 2021 Estimate 98.4% 82.1% Source: Bloomberg\n\nThe mid-cap group is expected to remain the earnings growth winner, justifying its inclusion in a broad equity investment strategy.\n\nIn summary, Thomas called mid-caps \u201dthe best-performing asset class in terms of market cap within equities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese companies are less cyclical because they are a bit larger than small-caps,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a little bit more diversification, which gives them more stability. They are not as deeply indebted.\u201d\n\nHe added that their relatively small sizes, when compared with large-cap companies, mean \u201cthere is room for growth.\u201d\n\nAn aggressive approach to mid-cap investing\n\nAmy Zhang manages the Alger Small Cap Focus Fund AOFAX, +0.14%, which has an excellent performance record. (She discussed small-cap stocks in April 2018 and in February 2019.) The fund\u2019s success and rapid growth has led Alger to close the fund to new investors. However, the firm launched the Alger Mid-Cap Focus Fund AFOIX, +0.00%, also managed by Zhang, in June.\n\nOne might reasonably expect a mid-cap fund following a very similar strategy to the same manager\u2019s small-cap fund to be a slower grower, but Zhang said that over the long term, \u201cmid-cap as an asset class has the best risk-adjusted return,\u201d and that over short periods, \u201cit can go either way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the point of having two products,\u201d she said.\n\nZhang uses the same \u201chigh-conviction\u201d strategy to run the new mid-cap fund, with the top 10 holdings (of 49) making up nearly 30% of total assets as of Aug 31:\n\nVeeva Systems VEEV, +0.55% has a market cap of $19.3 and is held by both the Alger Small Cap Focus Fund and the Alger Mid-Cap Focus Fund. Zhang stressed the importance of \u201cletting winners run.\u201d She said that Veeva has achieved an operating margin of 28%, and that this was the \u201chighest among SaaS companies.\u201d SaaS stands for software as a service.\n\nVeeva\u2019s Vault system is a cloud-based content-management platform used in the life-sciences industry that has been providing an increasing portion of the company\u2019s total revenue \u2014 now more than 50%, according to its second fiscal-quarter earnings release. According to Zhang, Vault has a much higher profit margin than the company\u2019s legacy customer relationship management (CRM) system, which it developed in partnership with Salesforce.com CRM, +0.54%.\n\nThe top holding of the fund is Planet Fitness PLNT, -0.15%, which has a market cap of $5.2 billion. Zhang believes the company still has a very long runway for growing its franchise base from a total of 1,859 stores as of June 30.\n\n\u201cThere are not that many great consumer companies [with] franchise concepts,\u201d she said.\n\nPlanet Fitness\u2019 advantages include \u201cvery seasoned franchisees,\u201d many of whom wish to expand by opening more stores, Zhang said. She said the company had \u201ca rare combination of unit growth and comparable [same-store sales] growth\u201d and that she believed its goal of expanding to 4,000 stores is attainable.\n\nIdexx Laboratories IDXX, +0.39% is another holding of the Alger Mid-Cap Focus Fund, with a market cap of $23.5 billion. The company focuses on providing diagnostic products to the veterinary industry. Idexx reported a 7% increase in second-quarter sales from a year earlier, while earnings per share were up 17%.\n\nZhang said that as the largest player in companion animal diagnostic testing, Idexx is uniquely positioned to take advantage of an important secular trend: \u201cThere is increasing pet ownership among millennials. There is an increasing notion that pets are part of the family.\u201d\n\nConsider how likely you might be to spare no expense in an effort to help your own beloved cat, dog or other pet.\n\nZhang called Idexx \u201ca compounder\u201d that she has been following for years. She cited \u201cvery strong customer loyalty\u201d and continued share buybacks as attractive features, while emphasizing \u201cthe humanization of pets.\u201d\n\nPassive approaches to mid-cap investing\n\nThe iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF IWR, -0.30% holds all the stocks in the Russell Mid-Cap Index and has annual expenses of 0.29% of assets.\n\nFor a non-ETF option, the iShares Shares Russell Mid-Cap Index Fund BRMIX, -0.27% has the same objective, with a net expense ratio of 0.11%, including waivers. (The fund\u2019s gross expense ratio is 0.13%.)\n\nYou might prefer index funds that focus on a smaller subset of the mid-cap world by tracking the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index MID, -0.19%. Stocks in this index have market caps of up to $14.5 billion, according to data provided by FactSet, while 182 of the roughly 800 stocks in the Russell Mid-Cap Index have market caps above that level, with 96 above $20 billion and 17 above $30 billion.\n\nHere are some ETFs that track the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index:\n\n\u2022 SPDR S&P Mid-Cap 400 ETF MDY, -0.19% \u2014 expense ratio: 0.24%.\n\n\u2022 Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 ETF IVOO, -0.20% \u2014 expense ratio: 0.15%.\n\n\u2022 iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF IJH, -0.21% \u2014 expense ratio: 0.07%.\n\nThrere are various ETFs and index mutual funds that track mid-cap indexes and subsets of them. Some may be available through your employer-sponsored retirement account. It is a good idea to check periodically to see what is available in your plan \u2014 it may be more flexible than you realize, and you should periodically consider whether your investment allocation is the best one.\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "Mid-cap companies can offer large-cap quality with small-cap growth.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR657_PLNT_2_ZG_20190919135048.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
