Why are you 'lending' guns to people unsupervised who can't pass a basic background check?' Ocasio-Cortez questioned in a tweet Wednesday. 'The people you're giving a gun to have likely abused their spouse or have a violent criminal record, & you may not know it. Why on earth would you do that?'\n\nShe was responding to a tweet from Crenshaw Tuesday where he lamented if Congress passed a universal background check law his friends who don't own a gun might not be able to defend themselves through borrowing his firearms.\n\n'Situations like this story are why we protect the 2nd Amendment. Side note: With universal background checks, I wouldn't be able to let my friends borrow my handgun when they travel alone like this. We would make felons out of people just for defending themselves,' he wrote Tuesday.\n\nCrenshaw's tweet was attached to a local news story in Houston, Texas \u2013 which is included in the district he represents \u2013 where a woman was able to evade a potential robbery by shooting her gun from her car at five men.\n\nFreshmen Reps. Dan Crenshaw and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got into a Twitter spat after Crenshaw said universal background checks would prevents him from being able to loan his gun to friends for personal protection\n\nOcasio-Cortez questioned 'why on earth' her Republican colleague would loan out a gun to someone that couldn't pass a background check\n\nCrenshaw suggested that Ocasio-Cortez wasn't familiar with America outside of New York City, where she represents parts of The Bronx and Queens. He claimed people lend guns to friends for self-defense and hunting\n\nOcasio-Cortez pushed back again, insisting Crenshaw \u2013 a former Navy SEAL and Purple Heart recipient \u2013'keep up,' because New York state is one of the safest states in terms of gun violence rates\n\nThe two representatives got into a back and forth over gun reform on Twitter, with Crenshaw suggesting Ocasio-Cortez wasn't familiar with America outside of New York City. Ocasio-Cortez's district includes parts of The Bronx and Queens.\n\n'Just so I'm clear: you think my friends are domestic abusers/criminals? Seriously that's your argument? That they can't pass a background check?' Crenshaw clapped back at his fellow freshmen representative.\n\n'Wrong,' he continued. 'People lend guns to friends, esp if they don't own a gun, for self-defense and hunting purposes. This is America outside NYC.'\n\nOcasio-Cortez, however, pushed that her colleague needed to 'keep up,' claiming that New York state is the safest in terms of gun violence in the U.S. She also said no one should be lending guns to those who potentially wouldn't pass a background check.\n\n'You said w/ universal background checks, you wouldn't be able to 'lend' guns to friends. If a background check would be a problem, then you shouldn't 'lend' a gun,' she wrote. 'And btw, NY is one of the safest states in the country when it comes to guns, incl rural areas. Try to keep up.'\n\nIn terms of the rate of deaths as a result of gun violence, it appears New York is in the top five safest states, while Texas ranks somewhere in the low to mid 20s.\n\nOcasio-Cortez (left) and Crenshaw (right) were both elected to their first term in Congress in the 2018 midterms and have been serving since they were sworn in January 2019\n\nThere have been increased calls for stricter background check laws after a string of mass shootings recently. The latest in Texas over the weekend when a gunman killed seven people as he shot at passerby cars and pedestrians during a rampage that spanned about 10 miles\n\nCalls for more gun reform, including more strict background checks, have increased after a string of recent mass shootings.\n\nAt the beginning of August, two shootings in one weekend resulted in 31 combined deaths in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. And over the weekend, seven more died after a driving gunman shot seemingly randomly while fleeing from police after a routine traffic stop.\n\nThe shootings have reinvigorated attempts from Democrats to make obtaining firearms more difficult through gun reform, and even Donald Trump said last month that the U.S. has an 'appetite' for more strict background check laws.\n\nCrenshaw, a former Navy SEAL who lost his right eye in 2012 after a bomb detonated in Afghanistan during his third deployment, is a big advocate for the Second Amendment.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, on the other hand, pushes for gun reform, including calling for a federal ban on assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.\n\nBoth the progressive Democrat and conservative Republican were elected in the 2018 midterms and began their tenure in Congress in January 2019.", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lashed out Wednesday after Republican Dan Crenshaw complained that stricter background check laws would prevent him from loaning his gun to friends.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/04/21/18076762-0-image-a-10_1567630154117.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
