A woman is the first to leave, and is told repeatedly by the soldiers to be calm. She protests that there are children inside.\n\nThen the young cartel leader, believed to be around 27 years old, comes out of the house and is searched by police.\n\nHe is handed a phone and asked to call off the violence which is happening all around the house in the city of Culiacan, Sinaloa state. He refuses to help calm the chaos.\n\nOutside the house, cartel members were waging war on the city - freeing prisoners from a city prison, setting vehicles on fire and launching an all-out assault using trucks mounted with machine guns.", "description": "The Mexican government has released footage of the disastrous raid to capture Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman's son, which ended with 19 soldiers and police officers injured, and Ovidio Guzman eventually released by the armed forces.", "authors": ["Harriet Alexander", "Allister Heath", "David Goodhart", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/RHvwgUzWmzg/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
