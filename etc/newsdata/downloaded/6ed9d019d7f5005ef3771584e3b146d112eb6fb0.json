(MCD) , which fell 2.65% on Tuesday. Hitting the stock was a research note from JP Morgan analysts, saying that same-store sales would be disappointing this quarter. The analysts are confident that estimates are too high for the quarter, Cramer said. McDonald's is losing market share to competitors and delivery will not be as impactful as investors hope.\n\nThis is a tough call, Cramer said, pointing out that the analyst still has a buy rating on the stock. For his part, Cramer agrees that McDonald's stock is a buy. But that's part of the problem, as almost every analyst has a buy rating on MCD. That means it could get hit by downgrades at some point.\n\nIf you're a long-term investor in McDonald's, Cramer suggests riding out the possible storm. Let's check out the charts and indicators to see what downside risk may be cooking.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of MCD, below, we can see that the month of September was a time of weakness. MCD gapped below the flat 50-day moving average line in early September and more recently failed at the underside of the line. Prices are close to making a new low for the move down from the August high.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is still in an uptrend but close to turning lower.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is below the zero line in sell territory.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MCD, below, we can see a mixed picture. Prices are still above the rising 40-week moving average line but we know this is a lagging indicator.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been flat the past three months and that is a bearish divergence when compared to the price action.\n\nThe trend-following MACD oscillator crossed to a take profits sell signal at the beginning of September.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MCD, below, we can see a modest downside price target in the $193 area. If this price target is reached it means the rising 200-day average line has been broken.\n\nBottom line strategy: To me, risk is a function in part of your purchase price. If you are long MCD from much lower levels a pullback to the $193 area is not terrible. But if a profit could turn into a loss you should take action.", "description": "Let's check out the charts and indicators to see what downside risk may be cooking....MCD", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Mcdonald'S Could Weaken Further In The Weeks Ahead", "Let'S Check Out The Charts", "Indicators To See What Downside Risk May Be Cooking.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Alex Frew Mcmillan", "Bret Jensen", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/57224bbc-fd4b-11e8-86d7-dd605207f4b2.jpg"}
