As you pay down debt or save more, that number will continue to rise.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nFinancially speaking, everyone has a net worth. It's what you're left with after subtracting your liabilities (what you owe) from your assets (what you own).\n\nNot to be confused with income \u2014 that's what you earn from your job and what's reported on an income-tax return \u2014 your net worth is a single figure that represents your financial standing. It can be negative or positive, large or small. While a $1 million net worth is often coveted in popular culture, there's no \"right\" number. Many people's net worth increases with age, though.\n\nImportantly, a high income doesn't necessarily translate to a high net worth, which is why the latter is often a better benchmark for measuring wealth. As of 2016, the typical American family had a net worth of $97,290.\n\nHere's how to calculate yours:\n\nHow to calculate net worth\n\n1. List your assets\n\nFirst you need to list out everything you own that has substantial value. While this does include some intangible assets like your investment accounts, it does not include your salary. Your income is part of your cash flow, not your net worth.\n\nHere's what you should include:\n\nModes of transportation, including cars, motorcycles, and boats (note that there is a more complicated calculation to determine the actual value of depreciating assets like these, but we won't get into it for the sake of this example)\n\nThe market value of your home, if you own it\n\nThe cash value of a permanent life insurance policy\n\nThe balance of any retirement accounts\n\nThe balance of any taxable investment accounts\n\nThe balance of any savings accounts\n\nThe balance of any checking accounts\n\nSome things you may consider including:\n\nThe cash value of any expensive jewelry, fine art, furniture, or clothing\n\nBusiness interests\n\n2. List your debts\n\nYour debt is what you owe to creditors or lenders.\n\nHere's what you should include:\n\nThe balance of any mortgage(s)\n\nThe total balance on any student loans\n\nThe balance of an auto loan\n\nThe balance of a personal loan\n\nThe balance of a business loan\n\nThe outstanding balance on any credit cards\n\nAny outstanding tax liability\n\n3. Subtract your liabilities from your assets\n\nAfter tallying up the above figures, you'll need to subtract your liabilities from your assets. The number you're left with is your net worth.\n\nBut remember that net worth is a snapshot in time. If you're regularly making debt payments, or saving automatically in your 401(k), for example, your net worth will rise over time. On the flip side, if you take out a new loan or rack up a big credit-card bill, your net worth may fall. You can use an online tool like Personal Capital to link up all your accounts and automatically update your net worth and track it over time.\n\nNet worth isn't the be-all and end-all when it comes to financial health, but it can be a simple and valuable tool for tracking progress toward your financial goals.", "description": "You'll need your total assets and total liabilities to calculate your net worth.
