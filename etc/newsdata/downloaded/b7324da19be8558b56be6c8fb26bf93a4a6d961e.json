(AP) - It\u2019s easy for Demarcus Robinson to get overlooked in the Kansas City Chiefs\u2018 offense.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is the record-setting quarterback and reigning league MVP. Tyreek Hill is the wide receiver with the game-breaking speed. Sammy Watkins is the former No. 4 overall draft pick living up to expectations at long last. Travis Kelce is one of the game\u2019s best tight ends.\n\nSo when Hill went down with a fractured collarbone in a Week 1 rout of Jacksonville, everyone assumed those other guys would pick up the slack. Or perhaps rookie wide receiver Mecole Hardman or the running back tandem of LeSean McCoy and Damien Williams.\n\nIt sure looked like the Oakland Raiders thought that, too.\n\nRobinson took advantage of them overlooking him, hauling in all six passes Mahomes threw his way for 172 yards and two of the Chiefs\u2018 four second-quarter touchdowns. The scoring strikes covered 44 and 39 yards, and a couple of his grabs were the kind of highlight-reel stuff of superstars.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that gets lost in the shuffle of things sometimes,\u201d Mahomes said after the 28-10 victory Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that\u2019s super talented and makes a lot of big plays happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everything from catching the ball on scrambles to catching touchdowns when he\u2019s my last read across the middle of the field,\u201d Mahomes continued. \u201cHe\u2019ll make the blocks and do whatever he can to help his teammates out. When you have guys that play hard for each other and they find their time to shine, it\u2019s always good to see that.\u201d\n\nRobinson has never been the flashiest wide receiver. Never been the No. 1 option. Never been the focus of attention, particularly given the vast array of weapons in the Kansas City offense.\n\nHeck, he wasn\u2019t chosen until the fourth round of the 2016 draft. He was the 14th wide receiver selected, though part of that was due to character concerns that followed him out of college.\n\nRobinson was suspended twice as a freshman at Florida for failing multiple drug tests. He failed another the following season, then stayed out of trouble until November 2015, when he was suspended one more time just over an hour before kickoff against rival Florida State - this time, it was because Robinson had allegedly met with a marketing agent in violation of NCAA rules.\n\nThe Chiefs under coach Andy Reid have become a land of second chances, though. Some of the guys brought in with off-the-field issues haven\u2019t worked out - running back Kareem Hunt or cornerback Marcus Peters - while others have steered clear of trouble and become crucial pieces of a Super Bowl contender.\n\nRobinson suddenly fits into the second category.\n\n\u201cMy hat goes off to him,\u201d Reid said. \u201cHe had a big day. Do your job and don\u2019t worry about results, don\u2019t worry about any of the credit or anything else. He kind of does all the dirty work.\u201d\n\nIt helped that Oakland appeared to zero in on Watkins and Kelce, allowing Robinson to find open seams down the field. But he also made a couple of tough grabs in traffic, and his willingness to block in the running game or serve as a decoy in the passing game ups his value.\n\nEspecially with Hill expected to miss at least another month.\n\n\u201cI got a chance to make some plays and I did,\u201d Robinson said with an audible shrug. \u201cEvery week can be a big week for us. We don\u2019t go out thinking it\u2019s Mecole\u2019s week or Kelce\u2019s week or Sammy\u2019s week. It can be all of our week. A lot of us got into the end zone. We made a couple of plays.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs will need to continue to make them.\n\nThey finally get a home game after a pair of road wins, but it\u2019s red-hot Baltimore rolling into Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday. Then, they hit the road against for a game in Detroit.\n\n\u201cWhenever guys get their opportunity, they\u2019re able to make plays,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about somebody else going down, it\u2019s about having the next-guy-up mentality. We\u2019re ready to hopefully get Tyreek back here soon, but at the same time, while he\u2019s not here those guys are going to step up.\u201d\n\nNOTES: McCoy was expected to undergo an MRI on his ankle Monday, though the Chiefs do not appear to think the injury is serious. He had 11 carries for 29 yards in Oakland. \u2026 Williams also is banged up, hurting his knee against the Raiders. That could mean more work for rookie RB Darwin Thompson when Baltimore comes calling this weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's easy for Demarcus Robinson to get overlooked in the Kansas City Chiefs' offense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/aptopix_chiefs_raiders_football_34460_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
