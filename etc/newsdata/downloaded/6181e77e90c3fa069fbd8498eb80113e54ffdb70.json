Two more declined later, she said.\n\nNow, it appears that all have turned down the government\u2019s invitation of bids. In a response to the Guardian\u2019s enquiry, the Hong Kong government\u2019s information services department said: \u201cThe quotation exercise lapsed as no bid was received by the close of the quotation period.\u201d\n\n'I'll take the blow for them': the volunteers protecting Hong Kong protesters Read more\n\nThe government said it \u201chas no immediate plan to conduct a procurement exercise of a similar nature. According to a copy of the government brief carried by the Holmes Report, a PR trade publication, the government was aware that the ongoing protests have raised concerns over Hong Kong\u2019s reputation \u201cas a global business and financial hub with a stable environment underpinned by the rule of law\u201d and the safety for business travellers and tourists.\n\nThe document said the government was seeking advice to \u201caddress negative perceptions in key markets overseas to maintain confidence in Hong Kong\u201d and to \u201cunderscore the strengths and attributes that differentiate Hong Kong from other cities in the region.\u201d It also wanted advice on how to \u201cbring out the success of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019\u201d policy - under which Hong Kong has been ruled under China after its handover of sovereignty from Britain in 1997.\n\nThe document called for \u201can initial assessment of Hong Kong\u2019s image overseas\u201d following the wave of protests that started in June, along with a proposed PR strategy to cope with the crisis. The campaign sought to target \u201cbusiness persons, investors, entrepreneurs, politicians and high-income leisure and business travellers\u201d from Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America. The submission period ended in late August.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam Photograph: Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters\n\nThree international PR firms that reportedly turned down the government contacted by the Guardian had not responded to emailed enquiries by late on Monday.\n\nPublic relations experts told the Guardian they were not surprised that the government was turned downbecause it is widely reviled by large numbers of Hong Kong citizens for its response to the protests.\n\nThe wave of demonstrations over a controversial extradition bill started in June but have since morphed into a broader anti-government campaign seeking democratic reforms.\n\nThe Guardian view on Hong Kong: what next? | Editorial Read more\n\nPR campaigns are no use unless concrete actions are taken by the government to address public demands, said Andy Ho, a veteran public relations consultant and a PR adviser to the chief executive from 2006 to 2012.\n\nAgainst such a background, Ho said a recent Hong Kong government advertisement placed in international newspapers in early September was ineffective. The advertisement said: \u201cWhat you read, see, hear \u2013 or \u201cshare\u201d on social media \u2013 is just one piece of a complex social, economic and political jigsaw puzzle. It is a puzzle that we will solve on our own.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut here we are, in the 15th week [of protests], we can\u2019t see much of an ability to solve [the puzzle],\u201d said Ho. \u201cYou watch TV and see riot police, tear gas, metro stations closing, airport lockdown \u2026 This is having a completely opposite effect.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Eight companies turned down opportunity because it would harm their reputations", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c1ff9a2ad26880a6cca0be4641d9e773a5c47e/0_169_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=36fc1bb47204f8241a7afd11a25786b2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
