Barricades and bloodshed in Bolivia. Weeks of unrest that have pushed Haiti to the brink and forced Ecuador\u2019s president to relocate his government.\n\n\u201cThis is a social revolution,\u201d said Andrea Lyn, a 61-year-old actor who took to the streets of Santiago this week. \u201cIt is us saying: \u2018No more\u2019.\u201d\n\nLatin America has been called \u201cthe forgotten continent\u201d \u2013 but in recent weeks it has hardly been out of the news.\n\nA succession of dramatic \u2013 and in several cases unforeseen \u2013 social explosions have catapulted the region into the global consciousness and left some asking if a Latin American spring has arrived. A headline in Mexico\u2019s El Universal newspaper this week declared Latin America and the Caribbean \u201cRed hot\u201d.\n\nIn an enormous and disparate region of 33 countries, more than 630 million people and governments from authoritarian left to far right, there is no single explanation for the political and social tremors currently rattling the region, from Quito to Caracas.\n\nBut longtime observers do see some common threads linking many of the convulsions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A supporter of President Evo Morales shows her support during a march in La Paz, Bolivia, on Wednesday. Photograph: Juan Karita/AP\n\nMichael Reid, the author of Forgotten Continent: The Battle for Latin America\u2019s Soul, saw three key catalysts: the economic discontent of an emerging middle class, fury over political roguery and the influence of other global protest movements shaking cities from Paris and Barcelona to Hong Kong.\n\nSix years of economic stagnation had brought an abrupt end to a commodity-fuelled 12-year period of growth and optimism during which poverty and inequality were reduced across Latin America.\n\n\u201cInequalities that were tolerable when there was a sense of opportunity and that the future was going to be better become less tolerable now \u2013 and you are seeing outbreaks of frustration when people feel that their wages are not going to go up or their children are not going to be better off than they are,\u201d Reid said.\n\nA second stimulus was public rage against Latin America\u2019s political machine after a wave of corruption scandals that have discredited traditional political elites, sparked furious protests in countries including Peru and Haiti, and propelled a new generation of populists to power in Brazil and Mexico.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Catholic faithful demonstrate in a silent and non-violent march in Port-au-Prince against the Haitian government on Tuesday.

Photograph: Dolores Ochoa/AP\n\nSuch sentiments are echoed in Haiti, where months of protests have left more than 20 dead and paralysed much of the country. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t do anything for us,\u201d fumed Jerome, a resident of the ramshackle Cit\u00e9 Soleil shanty in the capital Port-au-Prince. \u201cWe are left to literally live in shit.\u201d\n\nReid said he remembered only two other moments in his four decades covering Latin America when the region was in such a state of upheaval: during a period of \u201csavage austerity\u201d in the 1980s and then in the years leading up to Argentina\u2019s devastating economic crash in 2001. \u201cI think Latin America is up against it,\u201d he said.\n\n'They smashed me in the head': anger at Pi\u00f1era as Chile's bloodied protesters allege brutality Read more\n\nBut Reid was not completely pessimistic about the region\u2019s latest moment of ferment. \u201cI think this is a catharsis \u2013 and we will see what happens on the other side.\u201d\n\nGuillermoprieto said she felt trepidation as she watched the surge of protests sweep a region she has chronicled since the 1970s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any kind of forward movement as a result of these protests. [I feel] extreme worry and grimness,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople have been talking about whether this is the Latin American spring. And I really don\u2019t think it is because \u2013 just like in the US \u2013 there is absolutely no one waiting in the wings.\n\n\u201cSo I think it is bound to mostly end in tears,\u201d Guillermoprieto added. \u201cThere is a lot of frustration \u2013 but I don\u2019t see how it can lead anywhere.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Charis McGowan in Santiago, Dan Collyns in Quito and Joe Parkin Daniels in Port-au-Prince", "description": "From Chile to Ecuador and Bolivia to Haiti police and protesters are clashing on the streets, but what are the common threads and will they lead to change?", "authors": ["Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c523fda7d695ed575a4add69709d14c6bd36957/1020_709_1845_1107/master/1845.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ae0cc9351a90a8a624a27ed59f54e19", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
