Its participants \u2013 mainly amiable former public schoolboys named Mike \u2013 discussed the imminent retirement of a grey-haired freelancer, who had been working with the BBC for almost four decades. \u201cWe need to think about who is going to take over from David when this series is finished,\u201d a junior producer, Mike Gunton, remembered his boss saying. David Attenborough was nearing 65 and putting the finishing touches to The Trials of Life, the third of his epic series about the natural world. These programmes had been broadcast around the globe. They had established a new genre, perhaps even a new language, of wildlife films. It was a fine legacy. Now it was time to go.\n\nWhen Alastair Fothergill became head of the BBC Natural History Unit a few years later, executives were still worrying over the same question. The BBC director-general asked him to find a new David Attenborough. \u201cI remember thinking, that\u2019s not very sensible,\u201d said Fothergill. \u201cHe has always been this great oak tree under which it\u2019s been hard for a sapling to grow.\u201d Today, Mike Gunton has ascended the ranks to become creative director of the Natural History Unit. He still attends meetings on Whiteladies Road. But, three decades after the subject was first broached, finding the next David Attenborough is no longer on the agenda. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t got an answer and I don\u2019t want one,\u201d Gunton told me.\n\nAttenborough was born on 8 May 1926, 17 days after the Queen. And, like the Queen, he has become a symbol of stability in a turbulent world. It is hard to imagine a time before he was on our screens, affably engaging with sloths or giant turtles \u2013 partly because there wasn\u2019t. Television was invented the year after he was born, and only began to enter people\u2019s homes in the 1950s, when he was beginning his career. The first programme he made was watched by barely 10,000 people gazing at 405 flickering black-and-white lines on large boxes in living rooms in the south-east of England. This spring, his series Our Planet became Netflix\u2019s most-watched original documentary, watched by 33 million people in its first month. This autumn, the BBC will broadcast Seven Worlds, One Planet, the 19th blockbuster series he has written and presented (add a zero and then some if also counting his pre-70s series, short series and one-offs). The television executives who keep offering this 93-year-old freelancer bountiful employment agree that he is more powerful than ever.\n\nAttenborough and the Queen are more than just contemporaries. \u201cI see them quite a lot,\u201d Attenborough said of the royal family when I met him at his home in Richmond earlier this year. He first encountered the Queen\u2019s children, Charles and Anne, in 1958, when they toured the BBC\u2019s Lime Grove studios and the young presenter introduced them to his pet cockatoo, Cocky. In 1986, the year after Attenborough was knighted, he produced the first of six Christmas broadcasts for the Queen. Earlier this year, he was interviewed by Prince William on stage at Davos; the future king asked him for advice on how best to save the planet.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Attenborough on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury in June. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nIn our fractured age, Attenborough is the closest we have to a universally beloved public figure. Last year, a YouGov poll found him to be the most popular person in Britain. The crowd at Glastonbury\u2019s Pyramid stage roared when he appeared on stage this summer. Viewers of Love Island expressed outrage when one contestant declared she found his programmes boring. But Attenborough transcended national treasure status some years ago. He is a truly global figure now. So many Chinese viewers downloaded Blue Planet II \u201cthat it temporarily slowed down the country\u2019s internet\u201d, according to the Sunday Times. The premiere of his new series, which took place earlier this month in London, was broadcast live in South Africa and India, where rapt schoolchildren held up signs: \u201cThank you for being you \u2013 Sir David A\u201d and \u201cSir David please come to India please\u201d. As he moves from the White House to the World Economic Forum, urging presidents, businesspeople and the public to better protect the environment, he has come to be viewed, in a way he sees as overblown, as a keeper of humanity\u2019s conscience. \u201cThat man who saves the world,\u201d is how my seven-year-old daughter describes him.\n\n\u201cThere will never be another David Attenborough. What makes him special, apart from all his personal qualities, is the timing of his life,\u201d said Fothergill. When Attenborough began travelling the world in the 1950s, Fothergill noted, we were in a different geological epoch, the Holocene. Today, we live in the Anthropocene, an epoch defined by Homo sapiens\u2019 disruptive dominance of the planet. \u201cHe\u2019s seen more of the natural world than any human being that has ever lived on the planet and he\u2019s also seen more change than anyone else. And he feels a responsibility.\u201d\n\nDespite the adulation, one charge has dogged Attenborough for decades. Critics argue that he has built himself a unique storytelling platform, only to fail to tell the most important story of all: the destructive impact of people on the planet. But one reason Attenborough has thrived on screen for seven decades is because he has always sensed how attitudes are changing, and moved with the times. For a long time, he maintained that his programmes must showcase the wonders of the natural world, and not speak of the human one. Now his newest series are filled with urgent messages about environmental destruction. Still, he resists the idea that he has changed; he prefers to say that it is the public mood that has transformed. After a lifetime of caution, almost despite himself, he has become a leading champion for action.\n\nAttenborough fell in love with the natural world as a boy, exploring his way through his neighbourhood in Leicester, looking for bugs, insects and amphibians. The middle child of three brothers, he grew up in a family of teachers. His father was principal of University College, Leicester. His mother was a talented pianist. Education was revered. When I met Attenborough in the spring, he spoke of his boyhood passions \u2013 keeping tanks of tropical fish, venturing across northern England on his bike as a young teen, alone, in search of fossils.\n\nTo this day, Attenborough is still a collector \u2013 of tribal art, books and music \u2013 but although more than a dozen species are named after him, including a flightless weevil, Trigonopterus Attenboroughi, and a genus of dinosaur, Attenborosaurus, he is not an authority on natural history. \u201cEveryone thinks he\u2019s an amazing naturalist,\u201d said the producer and writer Mary Colwell, who worked with him at the Natural History Unit in the 2000s. \u201cHe isn\u2019t at all. He\u2019s a great storyteller. Everyone thinks he makes these programmes. He doesn\u2019t \u2013 but without him they wouldn\u2019t sparkle in the way they do.\u201d\n\nAttenborough agrees. \u201cWork and reputation get separated,\u201d he said. Forty years ago, he travelled around the world three times in order to make his groundbreaking series Life on Earth. He wrote the script, and every page of the accompanying book. \u201cBut now I just write and speak the words. And people say: \u2018What was it like when you saw that animal charging in?\u2019 And I say: \u2018I wasn\u2019t there. Thirty cameramen worked on this thing.\u2019 I\u2019m given credit for things I don\u2019t do. I am grateful, but I\u2019m also embarrassed.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Attenborough with a bird-eating spider in 2005 during an episode of Life In the Undergrowth. Photograph: BBC/Bridget Appleby/BBC\n\nIt is even worse, he said, when viewers assume he is a source of scientific wisdom. \u201cOK, I was a biologist once, but I\u2019m a hopeless birder. If I go out with a birder I keep my mouth shut. I just nod. \u2018Mmmm. Mmmm.\u2019 So to use a horrible word, I\u2019ve become a kind of icon. Using it in its original meaning, I\u2019m the image of what they think of as a naturalist. I\u2019m a reasonable naturalist, but I\u2019m not the great all-seeing source of all information, knowledge and understanding.\u201d At times, Attenborough\u2019s self-deprecation almost sounds like imposter syndrome. When I asked him to list his failings as a person, he narrowed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m too convincing,\u201d he laughed, comparing his own expertise unfavourably to other wildlife broadcasters such as Simon King and Liz Bonnin. \u201cWhen it comes to, as it were, conning your way through, I\u2019m not bad at it. Never identify things unnecessarily.\u201d\n\nEven so, plenty of colleagues recall Attenborough relishing his ability to surprise them with his knowledge. Jonny Keeling, the executive producer of Seven Worlds, One Planet, was excited to show his presenter never-obtained-before footage from China of a golden snub-nosed monkey. \u201c\u2018Oh yes, Rhinopithecus roxellana,\u2019\u201d remembered Attenborough instantly: he knew all about it and had tried to film it many years before.\n\nThe only praise Attenborough will accept is for his skill as a storyteller. Robert Attenborough, David\u2019s son and an anthropologist at the University of Cambridge, remembered, as a teenager, \u201cwatching him in the raconteur role as a host of a dinner party and admiring the skill with which he would tell a funny story. Sometimes they get slightly improved. That\u2019s something we used to tease him about. Of course he wouldn\u2019t do that, then or now, when making a serious point.\u201d\n\nAttenborough\u2019s storytelling has been honed over seven decades in television \u2013 and he is, above all, a TV man. After studying natural sciences at Cambridge, he married his university sweetheart, Jane Oriel, and ditched his boring junior publishing job for the glamorous new world of television. He started off behind the camera, after one of his first bosses decided his teeth were too big for a presenter. In 1954, Attenborough travelled to Sierra Leone with Jack Lester, London Zoo\u2019s curator of reptiles, to film a new series, Zoo Quest. The concept was simple: they would catch wild animals \u2013 their bounty from Sierra Leone included pythons, bird-eating spiders and their big prize, the bald-headed rockfowl \u2013 and bring them back to London to add to the zoo\u2019s collection. At the outset, Attenborough was the producer, director, sound man and animal-wrangler. He only ended up being the presenter because Lester was taken ill after the first episode.\n\nZoo Quest was broadcast in black and white, but the original colour footage, which was later discovered by BBC archivists, is beautiful. Attenborough narrates his encounters in clipped, 1950s, BBC-issue received pronunciation, with little trace of his more expressive later style. Although the colonial animal-snatching conceit of Zoo Quest is extremely dated, each episode focuses as much on the human worlds he visits as the exotic animals. Attenborough\u2019s script is factual, respectful and open-minded; his films unsensationally depict nudity, polygamy and other cultural traditions, alongside the animal hunt.\n\nOver the next few years, new series of Zoo Quest appeared and Attenborough\u2019s reputation grew. With his keen eye for the perceptions of his TV audience, he adapted cannily to a rapidly expanding industry. By the dawn of the 60s, as he admitted in his autobiography, Zoo Quest was looking \u201cincreasingly antiquated\u201d. He realised that it was time for a new approach. His next Quest series, filmed in northern Australia, eschewed attempts to bring animals home and instead depicted the cultural lives of Aboriginal peoples.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Attenborough with an armadillo on BBC TV in 1963. Photograph: BBC\n\nThe trip to Australia inspired him to take a part-time postgraduate degree in anthropology, but he was tempted back to full-time TV work before he could complete it. In 1965, he became controller of BBC Two, an appointment greeted with scepticism by \u201cTV professionals\u201d quoted in newspaper columns of the day. At first, he was considered lightweight, a youthful bit of eye-candy, but he was soon hailed for his \u201cunexpected\u201d success, as a Daily Express profile put it. \u201cEverybody forgot I wasn\u2019t just a naturalist \u2013 I was always a trained TV man,\u201d he told the paper in 1965. \u201cHell, I love it. I watch everything. Straight home from the office \u2013 switch to BBC Two \u2013 see all my babies.\u201d\n\nAs the channel\u2019s controller and then director of programmes for both BBC channels, Attenborough was a great innovator. In 1967, the government decided that BBC Two would become the first channel to switch to colour, and he set about exploiting this advantage. He put snooker on the channel and helped devise new forms of sport: one-day cricket and rugby league under floodlights. Programmes that emerged under his watch include Dad\u2019s Army, Porridge and Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. In 1972, he championed \u201ccommunity programming\u201d that included what has been described as the first sympathetic portrayal of transgender people on British television; he even suggested phone-ins to widen audience participation, years before they became a staple of TV and radio.\n\nOne of his lasting innovations was the all-you-need-to-know documentary, beginning with Kenneth Clark\u2019s Civilisation. Attenborough designed this epic, 12-part series about the history of art and culture to showcase the glory of colour television. These monumental series became known as \u201csledgehammers\u201d, and there followed uncompromisingly highbrow treatments of human evolution, economics and US history. But Attenborough believed the best subject for sledgehammer treatment was yet to come: natural history.\n\nAttenborough\u2019s achievements at BBC Two made him a prime candidate for director-general, the top job at the corporation. But he was tiring of the senior executive\u2019s life \u2013 desk-bound, constant meetings \u2013 and in the early 70s he resigned. \u201cThe fact he didn\u2019t want to stay as an executive and wanted to go back to programming says something very important about him,\u201d his son Robert told me. Attenborough yearned to be more creative, and had seen the thankless politics involved in the top job. \u201cThe Archangel Gabriel couldn\u2019t do the DG\u2019s job,\u201d he remarked to me.\n\nInstead, he persuaded the BBC that he could create a Civilisation-style treatment of the evolution of plants and animals. This series took three years to make, and the budget was so big that Attenborough had to pitch to US networks for funding. (He still enjoys impersonating a sceptical American TV man aghast at the prospect of funding a series that opened with \u201cslime mould\u201d.)\n\nLife on Earth was broadcast for 55 minutes on 13 consecutive Sunday evenings in 1979. It \u201cstarted quietly,\u201d according to Mike Salisbury, a former producer who worked on the programme. Despite the presence of a safari-suited Attenborough, binoculars around his neck, skipping between exotic locations, the early episodes often feel like a lecture with moving pictures. Our handsome presenter tries to make the best of diagrams of DNA, micro-organisms and 200m-year-old fossils. \u201cA whole lot of worms have left this delicate tracery of trails in what was mud,\u201d he enthuses in the Grand Canyon. Salisbury chuckled at the difficulty of bringing this to life on television: \u201cFossils, for God\u2019s sake. They don\u2019t even move.\u201d\n\nBut as its epic story slowly unfolds, the series warms up. The writing is often superb: \u201cFour million animals and plants in the world,\u201d says Attenborough, \u201cfour million different solutions to staying alive.\u201d The penultimate episode, on primates, features the first memorable Attenborough \u201ctwo shot\u201d, where he appears alongside another animal. He joins a grooming session among mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and still has the presence-of-mind to whisper: \u201cThere is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with a gorilla than any other animal I know.\u201d Although some facts have changed \u2013 we now know there are more than 8m species, not 4m \u2013 the series stands the test of time; one Cambridge professor still shows his undergraduates the primates episode each year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Attenborough introducing Prince Charles and Princess Anne to his cockatoo, Cocky, in 1958. Photograph: PA\n\nFor old-timers at the BBC, history is divided into before and after Life on Earth. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t realised what a game-changer it was going to be,\u201d said Salisbury. \u201cBy the end there were 14 million people watching it.\u201d The series established what television executives call the \u201cblue-chip\u201d natural history blockbuster. While the BBC has relinquished its dominance over most genres, it remains the pre-eminent maker of natural history programmes, according to Fothergill. So much of that \u201cis down to David\u201d, he said. Much imitated, these blockbusters are still a huge global export: the BBC will not reveal what profit, if any, these series make, but Planet Earth II and Blue Planet II were sold to more than 235 territories.\n\nAfter the success of Life on Earth, Attenborough spent much of the 80s completing what became a triumvirate of blue-chip behemoths, with The Living Planet exploring ecology and The Trials of Life revealing animal behaviour. He also turned his attention to series about less fashionable subjects: plants, spiders, stick insects and other invertebrates. Audiences liked his enthusiasm, his quick wit and his affection for animals, already evident from his early days bottle-feeding a tiny African bush rat in Zoo Quest.\n\nFrom Natural History Unit veterans such as Salisbury to colleagues today, everyone paints the same picture of Attenborough \u201cin the field\u201d: a team-player, carrying kit, energetic, curious, without vanity, funny, not suffering fools and preternaturally lucky. Everyone has a story about him joining a crew that has lucklessly staked out a target species for two weeks, only for that creature \u2013 whether Hungarian mayfly or polar bear \u2013 to suddenly hove into view. \u201cI don\u2019t like presenters on the whole. I don\u2019t think they are particularly nice people,\u201d one producer told me. But Attenborough was different. \u201cHe\u2019s not a prima donna. He\u2019s not an ego on a stick. He doesn\u2019t need to be now.\u201d\n\nBy the early 80s, Attenborough\u2019s programmes had been broadcast around the world and he became recognised wherever he went. But he was not yet, to use another label that vexes him, a global superstar. Until recently, when Attenborough\u2019s series were shown on US television, broadcasters would replace his narration with voices they thought an American audience would prefer. In 2010, when Life was broadcast in the US, Oprah Winfrey was the narrator.\n\nViewers tend to assume Attenborough writes every word he says on screen, while TV people think his lines are written for him. The truth is somewhere in between. Attenborough\u2019s scripts are written by production teams, but he is an unusually rigorous editor and rewriter. Even today, Attenborough rewrites each script to fit his own turn of phrase and checks for accuracy. \u201cIf I send him a script, he goes through it with a fine-tooth comb. More than any other presenter,\u201d said Mary Colwell. \u201cHis attention to detail is incredible and he won\u2019t say anything he doesn\u2019t want to say.\u201d\n\nGet the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n\nWhen filming, according to Mike Gunton, Attenborough does not learn his lines precisely. \u201cHe looks at it and comes back and says: \u2018What do you think if I say it like this?\u2019 His turn of phrase and the way he delivers these turns of phrase \u2013 it\u2019s got such power. He has the same genes as his brother,\u201d meaning Richard, the Oscar-winning actor-director, who died in 2014. \u201cI\u2019ve often said he\u2019s as good a performer as his brother,\u201d Gunton said.\n\n\u201cYou change the pace, you change the timbre, you change the mood, and the commentary has organic flow,\u201d Attenborough told me. \u201cIf the last sentence ended 10 seconds ago rather than one minute ago, you start in a different kind of way. I don\u2019t think other people do that. It\u2019s a craft, and I quite enjoy it, actually.\u201d His colleagues think his voice has improved with age. \u201cIf you go back to the older programmes, even on Blue Planet [from 2001], it\u2019s quite a clipped voice,\u201d said Fothergill. \u201cIt\u2019s now the voice of an older man, but it\u2019s become even more powerful, with a timbre and an emotional resonance.\u201d\n\nBy his own admission, it took some time for Attenborough to realise just what a threat humankind posed to the environment. When he was younger, he said, people knew of species that had gone extinct, such as the Arabian oryx and the dodo, but \u201cyou didn\u2019t perceive it as a major ecological problem. And in point of fact, let\u2019s be honest, if the Hawaiian goose disappears, the world doesn\u2019t actually judder in its revolutions.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until Life on Earth that he came to see that species decline was systemic and \u201cactually the disappearance of the giant panda represented some major change\u201d.\n\nFor most of his life, Attenborough\u2019s environmentalism has been the old-fashioned, off-screen variety, lending his support to numerous green charities. Ever since he was asked, as a bit of a joke, to open a visitor centre at a nature reserve by the village of Attenborough in Nottinghamshire, in 1966, he has given rousing speeches (I have seen several) at hundreds of events for nature charities across Britain. It is hard to find a visitor centre at a Wildlife Trust nature reserve that does not feature a silver plaque declaring that it was \u201cOpened by Sir David Attenborough\u201d.\n\nTo his critics, these good deeds do not make up for what they see as Attenborough\u2019s great failing as a broadcaster. Putting the case for the prosecution, the journalist George Monbiot has accused Attenborough of \u201cknowingly creating a false impression of the world\u201d by making films that underplay humanity\u2019s impact on the planet and fail to identify the forces driving mass extinction and the climate crisis. Another environmentalist told me that Attenborough possesses irreproachable integrity, but his long silence on extinction and global warming in his television work has contributed towards a popular knowledge deficit.\n\nRichard Mabey, a naturalist who worked in television before almost single-handedly reviving British nature writing, has long made a version of this argument. \u201cWhen Life on Earth came out in 1979, and The Living Planet five years later, I was concerned about the fact that this wasn\u2019t a place I recognised,\u201d Mabey told me. \u201cWhat one saw was magnificent, but it was what one didn\u2019t see \u2013 no humans, no environmental degradation. It was like an idealised biosphere on another planet.\u201d Once, in the early 80s, Mabey bumped into Attenborough at a lunch. \u201cI asked him, genuinely curious, why this picture of the planet was so devoid of environmental strife? He said, very simply: \u2018We wouldn\u2019t have got the viewers, they would have turned off.\u2019 I was quite distressed.\u201d\n\nTV executives repeat Attenborough\u2019s argument today. A blue-chip series costs millions to produce and requires global funding. BBC programme-makers are terrified of being seen as \u201cpolitical\u201d. At the launch of Seven Worlds, One Planet, Keeling insisted that it\u2019s not \u201cpreachy\u201d. As Miles Barton, a long-standing Attenborough producer, put it: \u201cThe more preachy you are, the lower the numbers are going to be.\u201d The lower the numbers, the less money the series will make, the less funding for the next. Mabey understood this equation. \u201cAttenborough has power over the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he has power over the money men. My initial worry about him not including environmental disasters in his early series may have been less his personal choice than corporate pressure.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Attenborough taking part in a discussion with Christine Lagarde, managing director of the Internation Monetary Fund, in Washington earlier this year. Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty\n\nAs a young producer, it was drilled into Attenborough that private convictions must not be aired in public. He has always upheld the values of the liberal establishment \u2013 avowedly internationalist and anti-populist in his veneration of expertise \u2013 and taken the traditional BBC line on party-political neutrality. \u201cI\u2019m not a political chap, I know about bugs,\u201d he protested when asked about Brexit in 2017. (When pushed, he revealed that he voted to remain.)\n\nLike most in the Natural History Unit, Attenborough has also long defended his work with a \u201cshow the wonders and then people will care\u201d argument. When we spoke earlier this year, Attenborough put it more bluntly: \u201cPeople ought to be concerned because they think the natural world is important. If they know nothing about the natural world they won\u2019t care a toss.\u201d\n\nTo a sympathetic observer, the lack of campaigning films in Attenborough\u2019s oeuvre might look like a canny political calculation about the most effective way to shift popular opinion over the long-term. But it may just reflect his temperament. \u201cI made natural history programmes not because I was a rampaging proselytiser preaching about conservation,\u201d he told me. \u201cI like looking at animals and seeing what they do.\u201d Attenborough praises more outspoken broadcasters, such as Chris Packham. \u201cChris is to be admired, actually, because he would sacrifice his career in the name of something that he thought was important about conservation. He would. And more strength to his elbow,\u201d he said. But that is not Attenborough\u2019s way. He acknowledged that he would \u201cprobably not\u201d ever risk getting banned from the BBC.\n\nIn public, he has always been reserved. Journalists have often noted his refusal to emote in interviews. This image of an emotionally repressed English gentleman, a man of his era, is not his private self at all, says his son. \u201cI regard him as an exception to all the rules of English maleness,\u201d said Robert. \u201cIn personal life, he\u2019s not shy with his emotions. I would not see him as a classic English male in that sense \u2013 he\u2019s a warmer person, a more expressive person than that.\u201d When Attenborough\u2019s wife, Jane, died 20 years ago, \u201chis grief was intense and fully expressed,\u201d remembered Robert.\n\nEven so, his public reticence and natural caution have made the final stage of his career all the more striking.\n\nIn November 2004, nearly 20 years after the phrase \u201cglobal warming\u201d was first coined, Attenborough attended a lecture in Belgium given by Ralph Cicerone, an American expert on atmospheric chemistry. The graphs that Cicerone presented, showing the rise in global temperatures, finally convinced Attenborough, beyond any doubt, that humans were responsible for the changing climate. Attenborough insists he was never a sceptic about man-made climate change; just cautious. Even after Cicerone\u2019s lecture, he still believed his job was to make programmes about wildlife. He worried that people would think he was setting himself up as an expert on climate science.\n\nAttenborough\u2019s output changed, however. This distinction may mystify those beyond the Natural History Unit, but its film-makers distinguish between natural history and \u201cenvironmental\u201d film-making. The former focus on animal or plant biology and behaviour; the latter address environmental issues. Attenborough\u2019s 2006 BBC two-parter, The Truth About Climate Change, was his first to address global warming explicitly. Three years later came How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?, which reflected his long-standing concern over the rising human population. (Attenborough\u2019s position incurred criticism from some who argued he was focusing more on environmental harm caused by poorer nations rather than over-consumption by wealthier populations.) This year came a new Attenborough BBC documentary, Climate Change: The Facts. Next year, the BBC will broadcast another, Extinction: The Facts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Extinction Rebellion protesters hold up an image of Attenborough in Parliament Square in April. Photograph: Richard Baker/In Pictures via Getty\n\nThe arrival of Blue Planet II in 2017 heralded a new urgency to Attenborough\u2019s blockbusters, helping transform popular attitudes towards waste and pollution with its images of plastic enveloping a turtle, and albatrosses unwittingly feeding plastic bags to their chicks. When I interviewed Attenborough this spring, his Netflix series Our Planet had not yet been released. It was billed as a significantly more pressing appeal to save the world, and Fothergill, its producer, was keen to assert its environmental credentials. Attenborough, meanwhile, seemed equally keen to assert that it wasn\u2019t so different to his earlier work: \u201cIf you forget the flummery and the propaganda and the press releases, what does it do? It shows the most breathtaking sequences you\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 beauty, wonder, spectacles filmed in a way that you never saw before, with drones and in fabulous colour, with surging music, and so on, and then at the end, it says it\u2019s all in danger. That\u2019s what they do. I\u2019m not ashamed of that. I think it\u2019s a perfectly valid thing.\u201d\n\nBut the strange thing, when you sat down to watch Our Planet, was that it did not match Attenborough\u2019s billing. Each episode began with him discussing the moon landing. \u201cSince then, the human population has more than doubled,\u201d his voiceover continued. \u201cThis series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain, and reveal what we must preserve to ensure that people and nature thrive.\u201d The series returned, relentlessly, to this manifesto. It explained the importance of rainforest for a habitable climate, and almost no stunning sequence of wild animals came without Attenborough emphasising the precariousness of their continued existence. Likewise, in Seven Worlds, One Planet, the environmental messages are no longer restricted to an appeal at the end of each episode. The first story about the impact of climate change comes 16 minutes into the opening episode. Throughout, there are sequences that highlight the human actions \u2013 climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, poaching \u2013 causing Earth\u2019s sixth great planetary extinction. \u201cWe are a behavioural wildlife show and we\u2019ve got a whole sequence without an animal in it \u2013 that\u2019s a remarkable change,\u201d said the series producer, Scott Alexander.\n\nThis shift in Attenborough\u2019s work reflects a response by film-makers, and particularly the Natural History Unit, to accusations that they have pulled punches in the past. Yet, as his protestations suggest, being \u201cenvironmental\u201d has not come easily to Attenborough. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s naturally an environmentalist at all,\u201d said one former colleague. \u201cHe\u2019s not eloquent when it comes to environmentalism. But you can\u2019t take away his intelligence, his understanding of the zeitgeist and his integrity.\u201d According to the source, Attenborough was initially reluctant to include the plastics story in Blue Planet II, worrying once again that \u201cit would be a turn-off\u201d. If that was the case \u2013 and senior BBC executives deny it \u2013 by the time the series was broadcast in 2017, Attenborough was fully behind the plastics episode. \u201cDavid really led on the plastics thing, talking about plastics before the series went out,\u201d said the producer Miles Barton.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Attenborough on location in Iceland for Seven Worlds, One Planet.

Susan, his daughter, keeps a watchful eye on him and tries in vain to scale back his speaking engagements and charitable commitments. (He has never put his name to any commercial product.) The BBC want him to narrate Planet Earth III, but he will be 96 when the time comes. Meanwhile, he devotes most of his considerable stamina to appealing for radical action to tackle the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. In Poland, at the UN climate change summit in 2018, he was chosen to represent the world\u2019s people in addressing leaders from almost 200 nations. At Davos, in early 2019, he questioned the wisdom of perpetual economic growth: only \u201ca madman or an economist\u201d would cling to this notion, he argued.\n\nEarlier this month, Attenborough launched Seven Worlds, One Planet with an exhausting round of interviews to journalists from six continents, while a police helicopter buzzed over Extinction Rebellion protests on the streets of London. At the premiere, when I asked if he was comfortable about his films inspiring Extinction Rebellion, he replied sharply: \u201cExtinction Rebellion doesn\u2019t have the monopoly of people who care about the planet. That\u2019s a section of people who care about the planet, but everybody should care about the planet. We\u2019re citizens of the planet. We have the dominance of it and we ought to care about it.\u201d\n\nThe Anthropocene epoch: have we entered a new phase of planetary history? Read more\n\nAttenborough has been supportive of school climate strikers, and likes to suggest that the planet now belongs in younger hands. He remains visibly fascinated by all kinds of life and social change around him, but instinctively cleaves to the role of his lifetime \u2013 as an interested observer, watching a new generation clamouring for environmental change. \u201cI\u2019ve had my share of the platform. I\u2019d be better off standing apart from it and trying to be as dispassionate as I can,\u201d he told me last week. \u201cI\u2019m old and they are young. They have their own techniques and their own ethos. It\u2019s their world, not mine, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "description": "The long read: He is the most beloved figure in Britain, and, at 93, a global superstar.
