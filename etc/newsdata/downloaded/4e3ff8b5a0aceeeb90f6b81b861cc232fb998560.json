Having lost more important votes more rapidly and immediately than any of his 76 predecessors and with no options left to break out of the trap his opponents have created for him, Johnson seems destined to rank amongst both the least effective and shortest of premierships.\n\nYet there is competition, quite apart from George Canning, who, after 119 days in office in 1827, succumbed to pneumonia. His last words were \u201cSpain and Portugal\u201d. In the past hundred years, the closest parallel to the current crisis and Johnson\u2019s dilemmas is probably Stanley Baldwin. Although now remembered as a towering figure who, with Ramsay MacDonald, dominated the politics of the inter-war era, Baldwin too had a terrible start to his premiership. He inherited the premiership in May 1923 after the departure of his Conservative colleague, prime minister Andrew Bonar Law, due to ill health. Baldwin then had to decide upon a Brexit-style great trade issue.\n\nThe question, which bedevilled British politics and divided the Tory party bitterly for decades, was whether the UK should be a fully free-trading nation, tariff-free and open to the world; or whether it should operate a policy of \u201cImperial preference\u201d, in which tariffs and the barriers to trade would be imposed on imports to the UK (including on foodstuffs and grains), but with lower or no duties levied on produce form the (then) British Empire and Commonwealth. Thus \u2013 hence the contemporary echo \u2013 there would be a bigger import tax on, say, dairy produce, meat or wheat imported from continental Europe than on equivalent produce from Canada, New Zealand or Australia.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Baldwin\u2019s gamble failed, and he lost the overall majority the Tories had gained at the November 1922 election.\n\nBaldwin did head the largest party, by some margin, in the Commons, but it was a hung parliament, and he felt he had no choice but to resign and make way for one of the opposition parties. That could have either been MacDonald\u2019s Labour Party, which came second, or HH Asquith\u2019s Liberals, who\u2019d finished third. Asquith passed on the opportunity, and thus Britain\u2019s first Labour government was formed by a man many regarded as little more than a Bolshevik Marxist extremist, the Jeremy Corbyn of his time.\n\nMacDonald\u2019s government didn\u2019t manage to achieve much, in the circumstances, but the historic symbolism of a working-class cabinet was obviously powerful. After a few months, the Labour government fell, oddly enough with a scandal about Russian interference in British politics hanging over it (in fact based on a forgery).\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nNor were the Baldwin and MacDonald episodes entirely isolated. So rocky was Sir Alec Douglas-Home\u2019s support in his own party in 1963 that when the Queen asked him if he could form a government \u2013 the usual formal courtesy \u2013 he was forced to reply: \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d He did remarkably well in the year he had in power.\n\nShort-lived governments plagued by having little or no majority in parliament but simultaneously trying to tackle monumental issues are in fact more common than is often believed. We have to look back only as far as John Major\u2019s troubled administration in the mid-1990s (again wrecked by rows about European integration) to see that. Other examples would be the Callaghan government of 1976-79 (though it lost relatively few votes and the cabinet stuck together even under severe economic pressures); and the short premiership of Anthony Eden 1955-57, infamously destroyed by the Suez crisis, an episode in which the realities of diminished British power and status proved a body blow to the political class. The parallels hardly need labouring.\n\nAnd so Boris Johnson is not quite alone as he trudges up and down the famous stairs in 10 Downing Street, past the portraits of so many past premiers, famous and obscure, successes and failures. He might derive some comfort, if not inspiration, from their troubles.
