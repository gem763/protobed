That she\u2019s not one to take herself so seriously as to believe there is anything heroic or legendary about her life is another reason to celebrate her.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the seemingly countless, varied roles or numerous honors, including three Oscars. As author Erin Carlson states, \u201cMost of all, she represents a meaningful goal for women: the courage to shed fear and inhibition and live a big, bold, authentic life.\u201d\n\nStreep created her first role in high school when she tamped down a naturally bossy, opinionated and loud personality to become more popular among the girls and with the boys. Her reward then was the crown of homecoming queen. At Vassar and Yale the real Meryl emerged, now impressing her drama teachers and classmates with her excellence at performance.\n\nTheater roles led to her first film, 1977\u2019s \u201cJulia\u201d with Jane Fonda, and the Emmy-winning miniseries \u201cHolocaust\u201d the next year. Prominent supporting roles in back-to-back winners of the Oscar for best picture - \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d in 1978 and \u201cKramer vs. Kramer\u201d in 1979 - signaled a talent that could carry a movie on its own steam. She became the go-to interpreter of complex women, whether fragile or strong, adorable or horrible, funny or sad.\n\nCarlson provides a serious but playful account of Streep\u2019s career and enough private moments to back up the actress\u2019 reputation as a generous colleague and a devoted wife and mother of four. Managing to have a life beyond stage and screen while conquering both venues points to her indefatigable nature and the courage to take roles that, on their face, don\u2019t seem right for her.\n\nSeveral come to mind: a Polish survivor of a Nazi death camp in \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice\u201d; an Oklahoma nuclear worker in \u201cSilkwood\u201d; the Danish author Karen Blixen in \u201cOut of Africa\u201d; an Italian war bride in \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County\u201d; British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in \u201cThe Iron Lady\u201d; and a songbird in the musical \u201cMama Mia!\u201d Time and again, she makes a role her own.\n\nOnly those who follow Streep closely may know that she is an outspoken liberal on many public issues - among them climate change, #MeToo and Donald Trump - because she doesn\u2019t demand center stage to be involved. Trump\u2019s declaration that she is \u201cone of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood\u201d is hardly the worst review she\u2019s received, but it might be one that she\u2019s proud of.\n\nBiographies of stumble-free high achievers are notoriously dull if informative. To put some spring in her research, Carlson writes in the breezy tone often found in celebrity profiles. She can\u2019t tap the drama overflowing in the lives of film\u2019s golden age actresses - Bette Davis and Joan Crawford come to mind - who lived large and played out their triumphs and tragedies in public. Not only is Streep private, her story lacks multiple husbands, on-set romances, scornful children and bitter professional feuds.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the work and the life beyond, a refreshing break from angst-ridden Hollywood backstories. Now 70, Streep still has the power to make us believe and question and feel, and the joy she has drawn from her efforts to blaze a singular path shines through in \u201cQueen Meryl.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDouglass K.
