Ashes fourth Test: England player ratings 1/11 Rory Burns - 6/10 Offered another example of his admirable application with a first-innings 81, confirming his status as the most prolific opener in the series, only to bag a three-ball duck in the second. AFP/Getty Images 2/11 Joe Denly - 5 Shuffled back up to the top of the order and showed the right kind of resolve as England searched for a draw, holding out for 123 balls. Will be on duty at the Oval but at 33, for how much longer? AFP/Getty Images 3/11 Joe Root - 5 Made a battling 71 on day three then became the first England captain to make three ducks in a series when Pat Cummins bowled him with a snorter on the fourth evening. A second unsuccessful Ashes campaign as skipper. Getty Images 4/11 Jason Roy - 4 Swapped positions with Denly after a torrid time at opener, making 22 and 31. Still looks a long way from proving himself a Test batsman. PA 5/11 Ben Stokes - 4 A crash back to earth after his unforgettable outing at Headingley. Could not produce a third batting miracle of the summer and injured his right shoulder after an expensive stint with the ball. Getty Images 6/11 Jonny Bairstow - 4 Another disappointing return with the bat for a man whose tank might just be empty after a huge workload. Solid with the gloves. Action Images via Reuters 7/11 Jos Buttler - 7 Gave a good account of his battling qualities in each innings in what was easily his best game of the series. Needs a major score soon to silence doubts but this was a start. Getty Images 8/11 Craig Overton - 5 Selected to some surprise ahead of Chris Woakes and Sam Curran, the Somerset man's home debut was a mixed bag. His seamers were only a notch above functional but he dug down for nearly three hours in forlorn pursuit of a draw. AP 9/11 Jofra Archer - 4 Wicketless for the first time in his short Test career in the first innings and down on pace before his juices started flowing midway through the match. Still a huge talent but the quietest of his three outings to date. Action Images via Reuters 10/11 Stuart Broad - 7 Continued his playground bullying of David Warner, dismissing him twice for nought, and took his series wicket tally to 19 with five in the match. No blame attached here. Action Images via Reuters 11/11 Jack Leach - 5 Will forever rue the front-foot no-ball that cost England the best part of 100 runs from Steve Smith's bat, but plugged away and turned in another diligent tail-end defence.
