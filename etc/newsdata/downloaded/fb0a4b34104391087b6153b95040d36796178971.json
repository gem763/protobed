REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nIn a 30-day period between August and September, the group, dubbed \"Phosphorous\" by the company, made more than 2,700 attempts to identify consumer email accounts belonging to specific customers and then attacked 241 of those accounts.\n\n\"Four accounts were compromised as a result of these attempts; these four accounts were not associated with the US presidential campaign or current and former US government officials,\" the blog post said. \"Microsoft has notified the customers related to these investigations and threats and has worked as requested with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them.\"\n\nMicrosoft's blog post did not identify the election campaign whose network was targeted by Phosphorous hackers. Nineteen Democrats are seeking their party's nomination to run for president in the November 2020 election. Three Republicans have announced their candidacy to challenge Trump in the party's nominating contest.\n\nHacking to interfere in elections has become a concern for governments, especially since U.S intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a hacking and propaganda operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump become president. Moscow has denied any meddling.\n\nRead more: Chinese troops apparently wore QR codes on their body armor in the massive 70th anniversary parade\n\nTensions between the United States and Iran have risen since May 2018 when Trump withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions. Trump has since reinstated US sanctions, putting increased pressure on the Iranian economy, including its oil trade.\n\nThe Iranian government did not issue any immediate comment through state-run media on Microsoft's statement.\n\nPhosphorus is also known as APT 35, Charming Kitten, and Ajax Security Team, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based company said Phosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts.\n\nThe attacks were not technically sophisticated, the blog said. Hackers tried to use a significant amount of personal information to attack targets, it said.\n\n\"This effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering,\" the blog post said.\n\nMicrosoft has been tracking Phosphorus since 2013 and said in March that it had received a court order to take control of 99 websites the group used to execute attacks.\n\nA computer network used by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign here was hacked in a cyberattack on Democratic Party political organizations in that US election.\n\nBig tech companies are under pressure to ramp up security for next year's US elections and others around the world.\n\nCompanies including Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft and Twitter met with US intelligence agencies earlier in September to discuss security strategies.\n\nMicrosoft had said in a blog post in July that about 10,000 customers were targeted or compromised by nation-state attacks in the past year. Most of the activity originated from hackers in three countries: Iran, North Korea and Russia, the company said.\n\nReporting by Christopher Bing, Raphael Satter, Akanksha Rana, Vibhuti Sharma; Writing by Grant McCool; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Daniel Wallis", "description": "Donald Trump's official campaign website is the only remaining major contenders' site that is linked to Microsoft's cloud email service.", "authors": ["Christopher Bing", "Raphael Satter"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d97adc2707bdf16db559bfc?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
