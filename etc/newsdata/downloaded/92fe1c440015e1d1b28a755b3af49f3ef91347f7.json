A survey released earlier this week had PiS with 45 percent support, while the Civic Coalition \u2014 a grouping fronted by Civic Platform \u2014 trailed far behind on 30 percent. The opposition has been unable to dent that lead despite a host of scandals besetting Law and Justice.\n\nKidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska is supposed to change that.\n\n\"People want calm and common sense. Poles want someone who will think of them and who will be concerned with their issues,\" Schetyna said as he made the announcement.\n\nSchetyna is copying a similar move made by his rival, PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski. In 2015 Kaczy\u0144ski, who is also seen as divisive and unpopular, put forward Andrzej Duda as his party's presidential candidate and Beata Szyd\u0142o as prime minister \u2014 both of whom won. Although he's officially just an ordinary MP, Kaczy\u0144ski is Poland's de facto ruler.\n\nPiS hasn't said whether current Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki (also chosen by Kaczy\u0144ski) will continue in that role if the party wins the parliamentary election.\n\n\"First we have to win the election,\" Morawiecki said during a recent party rally, \"then the political leadership will make a decision.\"\n\nMorawiecki added that \"I am convinced that [Kaczy\u0144ski] would be an excellent and the best prime minister\" \u2014 a sentiment echoed by other senior PiS officials.\n\nPOLAND NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "Civic Platform leader unexpectedly steps back from the limelight.", "authors": ["Jan Cienski", "Eddy Wax"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_53232958-1200x628.jpg"}
