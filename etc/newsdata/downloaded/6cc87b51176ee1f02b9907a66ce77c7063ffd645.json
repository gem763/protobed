(USA Today Sports)\n\nWith one succinct tweet, delivered Tuesday morning, a new day unfolded in East Rutherford, New Jersey \u2014 and an era came to a screeching halt.\n\n\u201cDaniel Jones has been named Giants starting QB,\u201d the team formally announced on Twitter.\n\nTwo games into a season that initially belonged to Manning, the team felt it had no choice but to move on.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here\u2019s how.]\n\nIn 16 seasons, he helped lead the Giants to two Super Bowl wins, threw for 56,537 yards and 362 touchdowns, and, since 2005, has started every game except one. Frustrated fans will point to his lack of mobility, his waning play and his 116-116 career record as proof that he should have been shown the door a long time ago. But when given opportunities to devise a strategy that would allow their longtime quarterback to bow out gracefully in the transition to a new quarterback future, Mara and head coach Pat Shurmur repeatedly insisted Manning had their full support and that he gave them their best chance to win.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI hope Eli has a great year and Daniel never sees the field,\u201d Mara told reporters in mid-August. \u201cThat would be, in an ideal word, you\u2019d like to see that. At the end of the day, that is going to be a decision by the head coach as to when, or if, Daniel ends up playing this year.\u201d\n\nA month later, the Giants are turning the page on the Manning era altogether.\n\nTruth be told, Mara had to sign off on a move as monumental, as emotional and as franchise-defining as this. Especially after the team decided to keep Manning this offseason instead of cutting bait.\n\nManning was on borrowed time. That much was clear when former head coach Ben McAdoo botched the benching of the four-time Pro Bowler for Geno Smith in Week 13 of the 2017 season. That fiasco led to McAdoo\u2019s firing and the organization reaffirming its faith in Manning publicly. Even though it waned behind closed doors.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 mishandling of their quarterback situation also didn\u2019t end there.\n\nThey chose not to draft Sam Darnold or another quarterback in 2018 (in favor of selecting running back Saquon Barkley at No. 2 overall), and then made the curious decision not to cut bait with Manning earlier this year. Instead, a team with enormous roster holes to fill paid its aging quarterback $17 million in March \u2014 a $5 million roster bonus and $12 million salary.\n\nUltimately, the Giants did the expected. Albeit far sooner than anyone anticipated.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is a move that I felt was best for this team at this time,\u201d Shurmur said, via the team\u2019s web site. \u201c... This move is more about Daniel moving forward than about Eli.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 preseason performance paved the way for this dethroning. But exhibition games against backup defenders and vanilla defensive schemes is no indication of a true franchise guy. The first real test for Jones will be Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Todd Bowles\u2019 blitz-happy defense. And the Giants better hope \u201cDanny Dimes\u201d can adjust quickly to the steep NFL learning curve.\n\nThere was no doubt Manning\u2019s time would soon be up. Save for Barkley, the Giants\u2019 offense is nothing short of lifeless. The boos that rained down from the MetLife Stadium crowd during New York\u2019s 28-14 loss to Buffalo this past Sunday was further proof the fan base had simply had enough.\n\nJones is the hero they\u2019ve been waiting for. But how soon until the kid draws their ire?\n\nDeveloping NFL quarterbacks requires patience, plays built around his strengths and an unwavering commitment to see the process through.\n\nHopefully, for Jones\u2019 sake, the Giants do right by him. Because there is no going back to Manning.\n\nNot now.\n\nNot ever again.\n\nThe Book of Eli \u2014 at least, in New York \u2014 is complete.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Ultimately, the Giants did the expected.
