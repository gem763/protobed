South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris are at 6 percent each, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former El Paso congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke are at 3 percent, and businessman Andrew Yang polls at 2 percent.\n\nBiden\u2019s newfound lift can be attributed to increases in support among several key Democratic demographics. Forty-three percent of moderate and conservative Democrats now support Biden, compared to just 29 percent last month, while 42 percent of racial and ethnic minorities support the former vice president, up from 28 percent last month. Biden has seen an increase in support among both older and younger voters as well.\n\nThe spike in support for Biden comes as his campaign weathers controversy over his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, which have also become a focal point in the impeachment investigation against President Trump.\n\nDuring a July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to help his administration investigate allegations that Biden used his position as vice president to help Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma Holdings avoid a corruption probe soon after the younger Biden was appointed to its board of directors.\n\nBiden vigorously defended himself and his son during the Democratic debate earlier this month, saying neither had committed any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted from October 17 through 20 and surveyed 1,003 adults, 424 of whom were registered Democratic voters or Democratic-leaning independents. The margin of error is 3.7 percentage points for the entire poll and 5.8 points among potential Democratic voters.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "A new CNN poll shows former vice president Joe Biden surging past his 2020 opponents and retaking the lead in the race to the Democratic presidential nomination after falling behind for several weeks.Biden enjoys the support of 34 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, the highest", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5z97G9twP8zu5Q5uPrD7DA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/dc6b7811f87920e3b05450192c1c6b67", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
