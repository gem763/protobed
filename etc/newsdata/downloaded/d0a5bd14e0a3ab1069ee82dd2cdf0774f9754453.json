But the night ended with the Cardinals on top 7-6. \u201cMagic\u201d doesn\u2019t do this effort justice, but it\u2019s a lot more poetic than \u201copportunistic hitting and strategic small-ball engineering\u201d ... so we\u2019ll go with \u201cmagic.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the Cardinals do this before. Yadier Molina rallied St. Louis past the Mets in 2006 with a ninth-inning Game 7 NLCS homer, a run that ended in a world championship. You saw the wild-card-winning Cardinals dispatch these Braves and then fight their way back from Game 6 elimination against the Rangers\u2014literally down to their last strike\u2014to win the World Series. They scrapped their way to three more championship series and a World Series appearance only to go quiet after 2014. But maybe they weren\u2019t dead, only sleeping.\n\nThis was a game of three acts, and much like a magician making us believe he\u2019s just sawed his lovely assistant in half, the Cardinals suckered in the Braves, making them believe they had control of this game when St. Louis was lurking all along, waiting to drop history on Atlanta\u2019s beleaguered heads.\n\n\u201c[We have] the expectation to win, confidence in ourselves,\u201d third baseman Tommy Edman said after the game. \u201cWe have that confidence, our coaches have that confidence, having a bunch of veteran guys who\u2019ve been around forever\u2014those guys set the tone, and the young guys follow suit.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAtlanta\u2019s Dallas Keuchel opened up with four-plus innings of pitching that showed why the Braves picked him up midseason: to give Atlanta a stable start to October. Keuchel set down the Cardinals in order in the first, allowed one baserunner in the second, and induced two separate third-to-first double plays in the third and fourth. But by the fifth, he was laboring in the Georgia heat\u201494 degrees at first pitch\u2014and Braves manager Brian Snitker brought out the hook.\n\nThat was Act I, the Braves\u2019 missed opportunity. Atlanta could only manage one run through the first five innings despite running up Cardinals pitcher Miles Mikolas\u2019s pitch count early. The Cardinals manufactured a run in the fifth\u2014single, sacrifice, steal, score\u2014and the game hit the turn knotted up.\n\nAct II gave the Braves enough false hope to keep the sellout crowd of 42,631 chanting and chopping. A two-run play in the sixth\u2014Dansby Swanson hit a screamer to shortstop Paul DeJong, who forced a bad throw to second, allowing two runs to score\u2014gave Atlanta some breathing room.\n\nThis is not how you win postseason games \ud83d\ude2cpic.twitter.com/aRkMwKa9Kv \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 3, 2019\n\nAnd then came Act III. Much like in Houdini\u2019s famed water tank, Atlanta\u2019s breathing room didn\u2019t last long, and the Braves didn\u2019t realize they were chained up until it was too late. Luke Jackson came on to open the 8th for Atlanta, and his first pitch to Paul Goldschmidt ended up somewhere south of the Atlanta airport. A DeJong single, a Kolten Wong single, a Matt Carpenter flare into shallow left, and presto: Atlanta\u2019s lead was gone for good.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt hit it a mile\n\n\n\n(via @MLB) pic.twitter.com/OnzcKxX2Ko \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 4, 2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got guys that don\u2019t quit,\u201d Carpenter said after the game. \u201cWe keep fighting. We\u2019re relentless, we want to win every game. We\u2019re competitors. Tonight was a good example of that.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis dropped the hammer in the ninth, Marcell Ozuna doubling home two runs and Wong doubling home two more. Atlanta woke up in the bottom of the ninth, with Ronald Acuna Jr. and Freddie Freeman pounding homers to draw within one, but it was already too late. The Cardinals had put the game out of reach\u2014and with Cardinals ace Jack Flaherty on pace to start two of the final four games, the route to the LCS just got a whole lot tougher for Atlanta.\n\nNot that St. Louis is celebrating yet\u2014or at all. While the stadium loudspeakers played Vicki Lawrence\u2019s \u201cThe Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia\u201d\u2014a little on the nose there\u2014the Cardinals were in the visitors\u2019 locker room buttoning up and packing up, halfway done with their business trip.\n\n\u201cWe just try to play the game. We don\u2019t get too caught up. We go out there and try to do our best,\u201d Goldschmidt said, a quote as opaque as a closed curtain.\n\nSo what is it about this franchise that seems to make it a perpetual threat to break out and wreck standings? The players themselves don\u2019t subscribe to the \u201cmagic\u201d theory\u2014that\u2019s getting too deep in the weeds for many of the grinders in the Cardinal clubhouse\u2014but they will allow that there\u2019s something about the lineage of this team that gives them hope in every situation.\n\n\u201cYou have Opening Day, [the introduction of] the Cardinals Hall of Fame,\u201d Mikolas said. \u201cYou see those guys there, and it\u2019s kind of amazing. You\u2019re on a team here with [Adam] Wainwright and Yadi, and you see what they do. It filters down through the clubhouse. Guys are all go, no quit.\u201d\n\nThe odds remain long for the Cardinals to do much more than get past Atlanta, but a couple more wins in a couple more tight spots, and you never know. We\u2019ve seen what kinds of tricks this franchise can pull if you give them even one strike.\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
