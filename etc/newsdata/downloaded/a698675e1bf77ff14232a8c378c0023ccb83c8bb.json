In them Giuffre tells how Epstein directed her to have sex with other powerful men in his orbit, including, she said, the Queen\u2019s second oldest son, Andrew.\n\nGiuffre has previously alleged she was recruited by Epstein when she was 15 and was coerced into sexual activity with him and associates in return for payments.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Virginia Giuffre.

In a December 2014 court filing she claimed she was made to have sex with Andrew, among other friends of the financier. The prince has always vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nIn 2015 a court decided that the allegations made by Giuffre about the prince were \u201cimmaterial and impertinent\u201d and ordered them to be struck out of a defamation claim against Epstein\u2019s friend Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe prince hosted Epstein and Maxwell, a daughter of the late, disgraced British newspaper publisher Robert Maxwell. Ghislaine Maxwell has been accused of assisting Epstein\u2019s abuse, but denies any wrongdoing.\n\nGiuffre told NBC news anchor Savannah Guthrie about her allegation that Maxwell played a crucial role in the financier\u2019s alleged sex trafficking racket.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe first time in London, I was so young. Ghislaine woke me up in the morning and she said, \u2018You\u2019re gonna meet a prince today.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know at that point that I was going to be trafficked to that prince.\u201d\n\nShe added of Prince Andrew: \u201cHe denies that it ever happened. And he\u2019s going to keep denying that it ever happened. But he knows the truth. And I know the truth.\u201d\n\nThe prince has previously strongly denied any inappropriate behaviour or of being aware of any such behaviour from Epstein, in rare statements issued from Buckingham Palace. The palace pointed to those previous denials when asked about the Giuffre claims on Friday.\n\nThe prince said in a statement last month that he made Epstein\u2019s acquaintance in 1999 and saw him once or twice each year. The prince also said he stayed at several of Epstein\u2019s homes.\n\nHe said he did not \u201csee, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to [Epstein\u2019s] arrest and conviction\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release [from prison] in 2010 and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.\u201d\n\nThe prince also said: \u201cHis suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.\n\n\u201cThis is a difficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epstein\u2019s lifestyle. I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince Andrew with Virginia Roberts (centre) and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001.

And we went out to club Tramp. Prince Andrew got me alcohol. It was in the VIP section. I\u2019m pretty sure it was vodka.\n\n\u201cPrince Andrew was like, \u2018Let\u2019s dance together.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018OK.\u2019 And we leave club Tramp. And I hop in the car with Ghislaine and Jeffrey, and Ghislaine said, \u2018He\u2019s coming back to the house. And I want you to do for him what you do for Epstein.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nLast month, lawyers for some of Epstein\u2019s victims said Prince Andrew should give sworn testimony on \u201ceverything he knows\u201d about Epstein, after the prince said he was appalled by Epstein\u2019s sex crimes.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida: one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail, followed by a year of community control or house arrest.", "description": "Virginia Giuffre claims prince was participant in disgraced financier\u2019s exploitation of her", "authors": ["Joanna Walters"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d5bd63c6b0e800be177b9ecd7572ceb7851ad24/0_0_4094_2456/master/4094.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc52d64cb0cc92094f3b26018129a56b", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
