Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s seen a bit of a boom in polls for president lately, came forward with a statement about President Donald Trump\u2019s whistleblower affair that if nothing else, serves as a classic textbook example of How Liars Lie.\n\nThe unabashed ones, anyway.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump believes he is above the law \u2014 and he will continue to commit crimes from the White House until we hold him accountable,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nExcept, of course, that Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been found guilty of committing any crimes.\n\nYes. There is that.\n\nBut impeach away, Warren wrote.\n\n\u201cThe House needs to vote on articles of impeachment \u2014 and when it comes to the Senate,\u201d she tweeted, \u201cI will do what the Constitution requires.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the crime? What\u2019s the impeachable offense?\n\n\u201cDonald Trump solicited foreign interference in our elections from the Oval Office,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cHe attempted to cover up his actions. And his appointees intervened, against the law, to attempt to suppress this whistleblower complaint.\u201d\n\nExcept, of course, that Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been found guilty of any such thing.\n\nSmall fact. Small item to note.\n\nSmall, small facts that when omitted, lead to big, big lies.\n\nWarren, dubbed Pocahontas by this president for her omission of truths about her real, genuine ancestry, might want to reel in the indicting, impeaching rhetoric a bit \u2014 at least until Trump\u2019s found guilty of a crime. That\u2019s kind of how it works in this country; the crime comes before the hanging.\n\nUnless you\u2019re in the business of lying, that is.\n\nNot that she\u2019s the only one on the left who does this. But if this is what Democrats have to offer for their pick for president \u2014 if it\u2019s going to be Warren, not Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, or anyone else who faces Trump for the White House in 2020 \u2014 well then, voters ought to take note: She\u2019s got a track record of dishonesty.\n\nShe\u2019s blatantly telling lies right now about Trump as a way of advancing her own political designs.\n\nAnd she\u2019s about as unabashed, unapologetic, unashamed about her deceptions as they come.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
