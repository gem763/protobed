Broke: Gun control?", "language": "en", "text": "With virtually all other political news besides impeachment screeching to a halt, some liberal activists are raising an uncomfortable question. Weren\u2019t we supposed to be working on a new gun control deal? That\u2019s going to be the topic at a forum in Las Vegas today when ten Democratic 2020 hopefuls will be discussing the issue close to the anniversary of the worst mass shooting in the country\u2019s history which took place in that city. They clearly would all like to score a win on background checks at a minimum, but for some strange reason, the Republicans (and the President) might not be quite as willing to go along with the program. (Associated Press)\n\nAfter back-to-back mass shootings in Ohio and Texas this summer, gun control burst back on the scene as a major political issue for Democrats. Now it risks taking a back seat as impeachment fever overtakes Washington. Gun control advocates are determined to prevent that from happening. Ten White House hopefuls will be in Las Vegas for a forum on gun policy on Wednesday \u2014 almost two years to the day after a gunman killed 58 people at a country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. The event is being hosted by MSNBC, March for Our Lives and Giffords, the advocacy organization set up by former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was shot and gravely wounded during a constituent meeting in 2011.\n\nSo the Democrats in general and their presidential candidates, in particular, want to make sure that \u201cprogress\u201d on a new gun control bill isn\u2019t lost in all the impeachment hoopla? I\u2019m just trying to picture how that conversation with the President would go and nothing comes to mind.\n\nWe already know that no type of gun ban is going to make it through the Senate, and the President hasn\u2019t indicated that he\u2019s willing to go that far. And the only reason that there was any discussion of an expanded background check bill standing a chance was that Trump was talking about approving it. Even then, background checks weren\u2019t going to be an easy sell and wouldn\u2019t have drawn a majority of the GOP to their side.\n\nBut that was then and this was now. Support among Republicans will probably shrink significantly if they know that Trump won\u2019t sign off on it. And all of these Democrats who are meeting in Vegas are left in the position of having to basically say, you\u2019re a horrible person who needs to be impeached right now. And oh, by the way\u2026 would you mind supporting our gun control bill that\u2019s going to enrage your base?\n\nThe President appears to be pretty much on a rampage against the Democrats at the moment and there\u2019s little on his mind other than impeachment, witch hunts, and the 2020 election. Asking him for a favor right after saying you\u2019re going to try to throw him out of office might not turn out to have been the wisest strategy.", "description": "Change of plans", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-20.jpg"}
