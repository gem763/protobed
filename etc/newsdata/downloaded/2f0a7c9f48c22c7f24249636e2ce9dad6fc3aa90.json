But like prior bull markets, the rise in price is not continuous and we are in the midst of a consolidation, with potential downside risk near-term. In other words, the crypto market is not about being greedy, but rather, to keep sufficient dry powder to take advantage of dips.\"\n\nMr Lee said the start of this risk-off period was July 31st because Fundstrat\u2019s proprietary Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) fell below 66. \"Historically, a downturn in the BMI and a break below 66 signalled forthcoming weakness. And this has largely played out in 2019. We are now waiting for the BMI to fall below 30 before concluding sentiment has properly reset.\"\n\nWhat could go wrong? Mr Lee asks: \"White House and Congress have incrementally turned hostile to crypto, particularly because of Libra. As we have noted multiple times recently, we think the US remains the central crypto story over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\"Bottom line: We remain risk-off for bitcoin and crypto but see a higher probability of conditions improving within the next 10 weeks. Thus, bitcoin below $US7000 would be an attractive risk/reward (current ~$US7500).\"\n\nCommodities\n\nTD said it's looking for an inflection point in aluminium. \"As we look ahead to the horizon, however, we see some early signposts that global data may soon be troughing, after months of more frequent and larger misses on growth. This leads us to believe that aluminium may look for a bottom in the coming months, before a lukewarm recovery in 2020Q2 is possible, as prices are helped by a stabilising demand profile but capped by a substantial recovery in supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Heading into year-end, a wide-array of macro landmines could still test the market's fragility. Should a downside catalyst materialize and prompt markets to reach a point of 'maximum fragility', we could be tempted to bargain hunt if the opportunity presents itself, ahead of a potential normalisation in growth which should still lead prices to average $1850/t by mid 2020.\"\n\nZinc prices rose on Wednesday as available stocks in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses slipped to their lowest levels in more than two decades despite expectations of increased supply.\n\nCopper also ticked higher after protests disrupted some supply in top producer Chile.\n\nBenchmark zinc reached a three-month high of $US2487.50 a tonne before settling unchanged at $US2468.\n\n\"The fundamental story (with zinc) is that the transition to a surplus market keeps being pushed back,\" ING analyst Wenyu Yao said. Before long, however, additional supply will come through and push prices lower, she added.\n\nOn-warrant inventories in LME-registered warehouses fell to 35,125 tonnes, the lowest since at least 1998.\n\nCash zinc traded at a $US35 premium to three-month metal, up from around zero over July-September, suggesting lower availability of nearby material.\n\nSpeculative positioning was largely flat after a bout of short covering, brokers Marex Spectron said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe global zinc market saw a 106,000-tonne shortfall over January-July, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group said this month.\n\nAustralian sharemarket\n\nAXA Rosenberg sees new ways to predict volatility: Asset prices are high, interest rates are low and investors wonder how long markets will stay calm.
