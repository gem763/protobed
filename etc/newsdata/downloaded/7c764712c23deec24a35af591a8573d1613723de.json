But those advisers say her liberal stances on some issues and her \u201clikeability\u201d problem with segments of general election voters make her weaker against Trump than even a Biden hindered by gaffes, generational dissonances and a son with personal drama and a lobbying record.\n\n\u201cHe still feels safe,\u201d a Trump campaign adviser said of how U.S. voters perceive Biden. The former vice president is not saying \u201ccrazy, radical\u201d things and \u201cpeople think Biden will bring some semblance of normalcy.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s supporters also insist that Warren would put more states in play than most anyone: \u201cShe makes winning Wisconsin a sh*tload easier, and Michigan \u2014 are you kidding me?!\u201d a former White House official said.\n\nTo date, the attack strategy Trump\u2019s team has tested most successfully with voters who backed him in 2016 is painting Dem candidates as socialists, and it\u2019s a lot easier to stick a socialism tag on Warren than on Biden.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
