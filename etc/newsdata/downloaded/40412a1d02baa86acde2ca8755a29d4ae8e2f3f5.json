The Queen\u2019s Speech, which usually takes place annually, allows the government to set out their political agenda for the next Parliamentary session. During the speech, the Queen announces laws the government wants Parliament to approve, which is televised from the House of Commons. The queen has performed this duty more than 60 times during her 67-year reign. Watch the Queen\u2019s Speech live here: Lady Usher of the Black Rod (Picture: AFP) It is part of the State Opening of Parliamentary ceremony, which starts with the Queen travelling in horse-drawn carriage \u2013 the Diamond Jubilee Coach \u2013 from Buckingham Palace to Westminster. Before departing for the occasion, Queen Elizabeth II would have received the speech, written by ministers, from the throne of the House of Lords. Before she arrived, the priceless Imperial State Crown and other regalia used in the ceremony was brought to Parliament in a separate heavily-guarded carriage. The crown includes 2,868 diamonds, including the Second Star of Africa diamond, and many other gems.

As the Queen made her way over, MPs were called to the House of Commons by Black Road \u2013 a House of Lords official.
