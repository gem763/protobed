She was just 17 when they married in 1980; they divorced in 1985.\n\n\u201cThe night before we got married, instead of working on my vows, I was calling a guy I\u2019d met on a movie set,\u201d Moore writes. \u201cI snuck out of my own bachelorette party and went to his apartment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did I do that? Why didn\u2019t I go and see the man I was committing to spend the rest of my life with to express my doubts? Because I couldn\u2019t face the face that I was getting married to distract myself from grieving the death of my father,\u201d she writes. \u201cBecause I felt there was no room to question what I\u2019d already put in motion. I couldn\u2019t get out of the marriage, but I could sabotage it.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Demi Moore\u2019s Memoir Reveals She Was Raped at 15 and Abused Vicodin After Miscarriage: Report\n\nFollowing their split, Moore then married Bruce Willis in 1987, with whom she had three children: Rumer, 31, Scout, 28, and Tallulah Belle, 25.
