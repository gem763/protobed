Another 18 were missing and 175 injured after typhoon Hagibis, which paralyzed Tokyo on Saturday, dumped record levels of rain, public broadcaster NHK said. Almost half a million homes lost power.\n\nTen rivers in central and northeastern Japan burst their banks while dozens of others had overflowed, the government said, complicating rescue efforts. Evacuation centers filled up with residents, while some perished on their way to seek shelter, washed away by the flooding.\n\nSome of the worst damage hit Nagano city, central Japan, where the Chikuma River burst its banks, inundating large swaths of land in brown water and forcing military helicopters to airlift stranded people from homes.\n\nAt one evacuation center there, Kiyokazu Shimokawa, 71, said he waited all night with his wife and mother until they were finally rescued around 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) on Sunday. \"I made the mistake of figuring that as long as we were on the second floor of the house, we'd be fine,\" \u009d he told Reuters. \"When we realized that maybe we should evacuate, it was too late -- the water rose very quickly.\"\u009d\n\nRie Hasegawa, a woman in her 30s, said she never imagined her landlocked town would face a water-related disaster, recounting how shocked she was at how fast it all happened. \"The force of the water was incredible. It was dark, frightening, and I thought this might be the end,\" she said.", "description": "Japan Sends in Troops After Deadly Typhoon Floods Towns", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/14/2019101400461_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
