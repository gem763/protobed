Turkey invading, Kurds fleeing, ISIS escaping?! Like, the Middle East was already a geopolitical Jenga tower, with everyone trying to figure out the right move, and then Donald Trump comes in and he\u2019s like, \u2018What if we move the whole table?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump has justified his position to pull out of Syria by saying this is all part of his larger plan to bring American troops back home, and that makes sense,\u201d Noah continued. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t make sense is that \u2018home\u2019 seems to be another country in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nYes, Trump has reportedly sent 2,800 troops to Saudi Arabia in response to alleged attacks on Saudi oil facilities that the Trump administration has blamed on Iran. \u201cWe are sending troops and other things to the Middle East to help Saudi Arabia. But, are you ready? Saudi Arabia, at my request, has agreed to pay us for everything that we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s a first!\u201d Trump said during one of his regular White House lawn pressers.\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s right\u2014that is a first. I don\u2019t think America has ever rented out its military before. Like, that is a wild thing,\u201d offered Noah. \u201cHe\u2019s selling the military and \u2018other things\u2019? What are the \u2018other things\u2019? Does anybody ask? Nobody? What, does he just sneak Eric into the shipment?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird that you can rent out America\u2019s military,\u201d Noah added, before throwing to the show\u2019s senior war correspondent, Desi Lydic, to help \u201cclear things up.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is just fulfilling his promise to pull U.S. troops out of the Middle East,\u201d said Lydic. \u201cAnd you know what? It\u2019s refreshing! A lot of men say they\u2019ll pull out, but they don\u2019t. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me seven times\u2026 I have seven kids now.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cDaily Show\u201d host can\u2019t believe what Trump is pulling in the Middle East, from abandoning Kurdish allies and allowing ISIS prisoners to escape to protecting the Saudis.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_712,w_1266,x_0,y_28/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571115513/Screen_Shot_2019-10-15_at_12.44.25_AM_cgks33", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
