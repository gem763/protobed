But the truth is, it can also be a dangerous one for your company. Every new product launch \u2013 even if you\u2019ve successfully facilitated a few in the past \u2013 brings with it myriad opportunities for making crucial, company-impacting mistakes. This is something that\u2019s top-of-mind for me and my team as we\u2019re in the middle of launching our next product.\n\nFor one thing, if you\u2019re setting ambitious goals for your launch \u2013 including beating your competition and meeting your customers\u2019 perhaps raised expectations \u2013 you\u2019ll be shooting for it to be even bigger and better than your last. And in trying to one-up yourself, so to speak, you increase your chances of making mistakes. That risk becomes more pronounced the more confident in your product-launch process you are, as it can translate into complacency.\n\nNow, some mistakes will be small, but some can be truly damaging. So it pays to be overly cautious and aware of potential pitfalls heading into the launch process. This, of course, allows you to more purposefully avoid them. Here are the four mistakes you should pay close attention to.\n\n1) Not giving yourself enough time to prepare for everything\n\nAt my company, one of the biggest mistakes my team has made in the past is not giving ourselves enough time to prepare everything for the launch.\n\nThis is a remarkably easy mistake to make, especially when you\u2019re feeling confident that you understand everything a launch entails and don\u2019t plan for any of the inevitable complications that pop up. These complications can be financial (think unexpected costs), time-related, or a matter of misallocated human resources. Whatever the case, these things happen.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important, when planning, to bake in more time than you think you\u2019ll need. Give yourself more breathing room than you anticipate needing. That breathing room doubles as buffer space to manage the unknowable hiccups that are certain to come up.\n\nJust to give you an example, my team aims to launch our next product this November, but we started planning in June.\n\n2) Relying on what you think you know\n\nIn everyday life, we\u2019d label taking on a new project or job without first learning everything you can about it as shortsighted. Yet, in business \u2013 and when launching products, especially \u2013 far too many of us rely on our existing knowledge without investing adequately in education.\n\nPart of this has to do with our egos. We think just because we\u2019ve launched a product before, we understand the process. But that\u2019s not so. I realized this when we launched the first version of our product years ago.\n\nAt the time, my team was confident in its ability to manage media relations and conduct email marketing, and we thought that those two means of raising awareness would suffice in getting folks interested in our product. As a result, we didn\u2019t investigate anything related to, say, e-commerce optimization, or price variation, or forming strategic partnerships. We didn\u2019t think about what else we could have done. This ultimately held us back.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when you have adequate resources and you\u2019ve given yourself enough time, you absolutely need to invest in acquiring new knowledge, experimenting with different ways of doing things, and fostering new partnerships. In my experience, about 15-20 percent of your resources should go to this.\n\nSimply put, you can\u2019t rely on what you know. That\u2019s inherently limiting. Instead, look hard for additional information, insight, and expertise. Assume you never know everything.\n\n3) Relying on previous data to forecast future growth.\n\nSimilarly, don\u2019t rely on old data to plan for the future. If last year you made $1 million in sales, to use that as a benchmark for your next launch \u2013 or even 2x that as a benchmark \u2013 is foolish. You\u2019re essentially guaranteeing that you\u2019ll copy old processes and utilize the same channels as you have in the past. You\u2019re also limiting what you could achieve if you set your sights higher.\n\nSo, instead, flip the question around and ask what you need to accomplish your goals for this year. Say your goals are $5 million in sales. Guess what? If you plan for hitting that goal, and then actually shoot for that higher number, you\u2019re giving yourself a much better shot of reaching it. With the upcoming version of our product, for example, our goal is 4x growth over our last upgrade, so we\u2019re bolstering our product marketing and intelligence-gathering processes accordingly.\n\n4) Not being where your customers are\n\nFinally, for a product launch to resonate and succeed, you must be attuned to what your customers want and expect. That way, you can deliver. You can\u2019t simply sit in your office in the US and think you\u2019ll understand what your users in Japan want out of your product. That\u2019s the same issue as assuming you know more about business development than you actually do. When it comes to your customers, assume you can always be learning more \u2013 especially if those customers are in new markets.\n\nTo learn more about your customers, then, you need to actually go to that market and immerse yourself in it so as to understand it. In developing our new product (as well as in marketing it), we innovated and designed our messaging in accordance with what we understood our customers in each of our key regions wanted. A one-size-fits-all marketing plan simply won\u2019t resonate as strongly as it would were it tailored specifically for the German market, the American market, or the Japanese market.\n\nBut, again, you can\u2019t acquire the requisite knowledge from your siloed office. You have to go where your customers are and work to truly understand them. Don\u2019t expect them to come to you. They won\u2019t, nor should they be expected to.\n\nRemember that you\u2019re always going to have people who criticize certain aspects of your product launch\n\nAt the end of the day, you won\u2019t be able to please everyone. You\u2019ll make mistakes, and certain critics, competitors, and even customers may criticize you for it.\n\nBut you can\u2019t let them get you down. Instead, focus myopically on giving yourself the best possible chance to succeed. Which is to say, focus on planning intelligently, researching heavily, and then executing your launch effectively. This is what will allow you to avoid the pitfalls that commonly befall founders launching new products, and it\u2019s what, ultimately, will allow you to succeed.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alex Tsepko", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/podium?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fdownload30.png&signature=a4cb02ff37464e1147c105cacd0dff5c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
