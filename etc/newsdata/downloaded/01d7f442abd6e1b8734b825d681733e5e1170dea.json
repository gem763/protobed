It was the worst day for the market in weeks.\n\nThe decline was sparked in part by a weak reading from the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), which stood at 47.8 in September, the lowest reading since 2009. Any level below 50 indicates a contracting manufacturing sector. The lackluster reading fanned fears of a recession, which have been heating up in recent months, especially with the inversion of the yield curve in August. That has historically preceded past recessions.\n\nThe most recent Oct. 1 decline of more than 1% was back in 2014, when the S&P 500 fell 1.3%. It then gained 3.7% for the rest of the month and 5.8% for the rest of the year, according to data examined by Bespoke.\n\nIn fact, for all of the declines that exceeded 1% on the first trading session of October, the average S&P 500 gain for the rest of the month was 3.75% and 7.22% for the rest of the year, according to Bespoke.\n\nVolatile months for stocks\n\nHistorically, October and September are volatile months for stocks. Yet, Sept. 2019 was quite calm.\n\n\u201cWhat has us worried this October is the fact that September this year was historically calm. If we know one thing, it is that markets don\u2019t stay calm forever, and after a dull market last month, we could be due for some usual October volatility,\u201d wrote LPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick in a note to clients. \u201cThe S&P 500 in September 2019 didn\u2019t have a single 1% drop and only two 1% gains. This normally volatile month could be passing some big moves to October this year.\u201d\n\nFor the past 18 months, the stock market has been worried about the continuing trade war between the U.S. and China. The market has become sensitive to trade headlines during this time. Adding fuel to expectations of an already volatile October trading month are media reports that trade negotiations between the U.S. and China are set to resume on Oct. 10.\n\n\u201cMarkets will be looking for positive commentary from both sides going into this meeting and tangible steps to an agreement immediately after,\u201d wrote DataTrek Research co-founder Nick Colas in a note.\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
