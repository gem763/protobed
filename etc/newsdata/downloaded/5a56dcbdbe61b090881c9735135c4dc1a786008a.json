The problem that I had is that the judges were not even listening to me and not even looking at all the evidences that are just proving that I was innocent.\"\n\nHe says the odds were stacked against him from the beginning.\n\n\"At that point I would say that my take on the whole issue is I knew I was targeted. I knew that for the last 30 years I was demonised because of who I represent in the French political and public scene and the way I was treated here was quite clear. 'We are going to get him and he will end in jail.' This was my feeling from day one when I entered the police station.\"\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "The prominent professor of contemporary Islamic studies discusses the ongoing sexual assault accusations against him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/25/d77a992ecd634a798a684ff2f27e0a74_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
