(AP) - It\u2019s hard to regard Ellie as a menace.\n\nWhen Greg Manteufel is frustrated or feeling down, she sits by him. At night, she sleeps under his covers. At dinner, she\u2019s there next to him, knowing he\u2019ll throw something her way. She belies the stereotype of the vicious pit bull.\n\n\u201cWe love her like she\u2019s our daughter,\u201d he said of the dog.\n\nAnd yet, Ellie may be the reason Manteufel nearly died.\n\nGravely ill, he lost parts of his arms and legs, as well as the skin of his nose and part of his upper lip. The cause was capnocytophaga (cap-noh-seye-TOE\u2019-fah-gah), a germ from Ellie\u2019s mouth or from another dog he encountered.\n\nCapnocytophaga is commonly found in the saliva of cats and dogs and almost never leads to people getting sick, unless the person has a compromised immune system. But Manteufel was perfectly healthy. In fact, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever used his health insurance before he fell ill.\n\nThe case is extremely rare and doctors at his hospital, Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin, had no explanation on why he got so sick. But over the last 10 years there have been at least five other healthy people who have had severe reactions to the germ. A team of researchers connected with Harvard Medical School has developed a theory on why - a gene change in all the victims.\n\nAnd their finding means doctors can\u2019t rule out the capnocytophaga bacteria could strike Manteufel and other victims again.\n\n___\n\nGreg Manteufel thought he was getting the flu in June of 2018. He had a fever, vomiting and diarrhea. But when he started getting confused, his family took him to the hospital.\n\nDoctors did blood cultures and found capnocytophaga, which caused sepsis, a severe blood infection that led to his blood pressure dropping and many of his organs shutting down.\n\n\u201cDo what you have to,\u201d he told the doctors.\n\nHe had so much to live for - foremost, his wife of 16 years, Dawn, and 26-year-old son, Mike. He was just starting to get really good at his day job, painting houses. He cherished his Harley Davidson Electric Glide. He was in the middle of fixing up his \u201866 El Camino. And of course there was Ellie, the pup.\n\nAnd so he persisted, through more than 20 surgeries, including amputations of his left and right arms just below the elbow, and legs through the middle of the knee.\n\nHis wife and son stayed optimistic, because he was.\n\n\u201cGreg said he didn\u2019t come this far to lay down and let this beat him,\u201d Dawn Manteufel said.\n\nHe was out of the in-patient rehab unit in about two weeks, learning to move from his wheelchair to the bed, toilet and car. The usual stay is three to four weeks, said Dr. David Del Toro, medical director for the inpatient rehab unit at Froedtert.\n\nManteufel made similar quick advances using his arm prosthetics and leg prosthetics.\n\n\u201cHe does not seem like any other patient I\u2019ve met before,\u201d Del Toro said. \u201cHe\u2019s just, you know, full speed ahead.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, connected to Harvard Medical School, as well as Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center had been investigating cases like his.\n\nThe team has done genetic testing on five otherwise healthy people who suffered capnocytophaga infections to see if they could find anything in common. They discovered all had a gene connected to the immune system that was working differently - a genetic variant.\n\n\u201cIt was a really thrilling moment,\u201d said Elizabeth Fieg, a genetic counselor at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cThe stakes are so high with these cases and the patients have gone through so much.\u201d\n\nThey believe it makes those people more susceptible to developing severe medical problems from capnocytophaga. But they are also trying to determine if there are other risk factors.\n\nOf the five in the study, three survived with amputations and two did not. Fieg hopes their research can determine why some did not survive.\n\nShe also hopes if their theory is confirmed, it will help diagnose cases faster, and perhaps save lives and limbs.\n\nThat\u2019s why Greg Manteufel jumped at the chance to take part when he was approached in August.\n\nResearchers need to gather more evidence, but hope to publish their study in the next year to 18 months.\n\n___\n\nManteufel\u2019s life now includes frequent occupational therapy appointments to perfect his use of arm prosthetics - the kind with metal moveable hooks at the end. He\u2019s using a fork regularly and he\u2019s now working on picking up the TV remote, opening doorknobs, cutting vegetables and doing the dishes.\n\nHe\u2019s using shortened leg prosthetics, called stubbies, to get his body conditioned to eventually use to full-sized ones. Those are expected to arrive any day.\n\nPlastic surgeons plan another surgery to perfect his nose. They\u2019ve already moved skin from his forehead there. It looks oversized now, but it will eventually fit in with the rest of his face.\n\nHe plans to get his car revamped so he can drive with prosthetics. He wants to get a special pole so he can go fishing again. He is even considering going back to work painting.\n\nHe\u2019s also become less quiet and a lot more outgoing. \u201cNow everybody I see wants to hear something or talk to me. I tell them a 15-minute story about what happened. They probably want me to leave, you know,\u201d he said, chuckling.\n\nEllie\u2019s often by his side.\n\n\u201cShe loves kids. She loves puppies. Other dogs,\u201d Manteufel said.\n\nAs harmless as she seems, she may have capnocytophaga germ.\n\nThe results of Manteufel\u2019s genetic tests are expected in three to four months. Fieg said people with the gene variant are at increased risk for recurrent capnocytophaga or other infections in the future.\n\nWhile Manteufel doesn\u2019t like the sound of that, he said Ellie\u2019s accidentally scratched him since he\u2019s been home and even licked his mouth. He\u2019s been fine.\n\nAnd even if he does have the gene variant, he said, it changes nothing.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even bother testing her,\u201d said Manteufel. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to get rid of her if it was her that caused it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just love her to death.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's hard to regard Ellie as a menace.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Carrie Antlfinger"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/dog_lick_amputation_87158_c0-512-2991-2255_s1770x1032.jpg?281f64aad13e4bc8136a7fef4fe490542afc2c6b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
