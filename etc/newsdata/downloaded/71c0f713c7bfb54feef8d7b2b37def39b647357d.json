Brenner has merely joined the George Institute for Global Health. By no definition does a medical research institute qualify as corporate. Nor does its divulgence in a national newspaper pass as \u201cquietly\u201d.\n\nIndeed, only a client of Sue Cato\u2019s could find themselves the subject of an \u201cexclusive\u201d story in which they were unavailable for comment.\n\nFor excruciating inelegance, the naked rehabilitation attempt was up there with the May 2018 column \u2013 also in The Oz \u2013 in which Cato met Brenner for solidarity coffee outside Chifley Towers. A News Corp photographer just so happened to be standing by. Marvel at the elephantine stealth of 1990s PR.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping Brenner\u2019s actual return to corporate life looks a great deal less torturous than this.", "description": "Only a client of Sue Cato\u2019s could find themselves the subject of an \u201cexclusive\u201d story in which they were unavailable for comment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0383%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_8/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5965f6ea012580a818c2d1e69d87ab503a3868a1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
