This was slightly frustrating, as the trend continued to print lower highs and test key support levels, whilst at the back of our minds wondering if SNB were going to ratchet up the pressure and create a bearish shakeout. Well, it turns out they didn\u2019t need to.\n\nhas seen a clear shakeout at the lows and momentum suggests we could be looking at a deeper correction. Despite closing beneath 1.0835 last Tuesday, an inverted hammer on Wednesday warned of a reluctance to push lower. Thursday\u2019s bullish engulfing candle took it firmly back above support and created a 3-bar reversal pattern (morning star reversal) to suggest a bear-trap had been triggered. Furthermore, yesterday\u2019s clear break of the bearish trendline further suggests a new directional move could be underway.\n\nFrom here, we\u2019d want to see build a level of support along the broken trendline, or the swing high near 1.0928.\n\nCurrently resistance has been found near the 1.0962 low and 50% retracement level but, given the clear momentum shift form the lows, we\u2019d consider buying a dip and use the 1.0881 low as the \u2018invalidation point\u2019 to the counter-trend idea\n\nKeep in mind that ECB are due to meet on Thursday, so Euro crosses will be prime candidates for bouts of volatility. Whilst markets are expecting a 10-20bps cut, we also need to factor in revised staff projections and potential for asset purchases (with many expecting them to move into equities). Either way, there\u2019s a lot of expectation for ECB to act so, if these are not met adequately, we could end up with a higher Euro.\n\nRelated analysis\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: EUR/CHF.
