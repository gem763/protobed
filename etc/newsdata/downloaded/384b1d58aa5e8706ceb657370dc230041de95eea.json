If you compare what Chris Wallace said yesterday to what diGenova is saying today, it sounds like the Fox report was true \u2014 except for one important detail, if diGenova is to be believed.\n\nHere\u2019s what Wallace said:\n\n\u201cFox News has learned the president\u2019s private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was not acting alone in trying to get dirt from Ukrainian officials on 2020 rival Joe Biden. Two high-profile Washington lawyers, Joe diGenova, who\u2019s been a fierce critic of the Democratic investigation, and his wife Victoria Toensing were working with Giuliani to get oppo research on Biden. According to a top U.S. official, all three were working off the books apart from the administration. The only person in government who knows what they were doing is President Trump.\u201d\n\nPretty straightforward. Rudy wanted oppo from Ukraine on Biden, diGenova was helping, and they were doing it unofficially but with Trump\u2019s knowledge. Now here\u2019s diGenova in an interview this morning with WBAL, calling the report \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile [Giuliani] was looking into [evidence in Ukraine that people tried to frame Trump with the Russia collusion story], he came across information about Hunter Biden and Joe Biden that came up concerning the threat to hold back money and that Biden\u2019s son had received bribes. The prosecutor involved in that was the one that Biden had fired.\u201d \u201cHe asked us \u2013 Rudy \u2013 he asked us to represent any of the Ukrainian whistleblowers who wanted to provide information to U.S. law enforcement about what they had heard and learned,\u201d diGenova said. \u201cThey were fearful to come to U.S. law enforcement because the United States ambassador in the Ukraine at that time had threatened these individuals not to give information because, as she, the ambassador, put it, Trump was going to be impeached and Biden was going to be president.\u201d \u201cThe trip to Ukraine was cancelled,\u201d diGenova said. \u201cNo-one ever went there. No-one was ever talked to. We never had an opportunity, our law firm, to represent any whistleblowers. Any conversations we may have had with anybody prior to that time obviously are privileged. We were never representing the President of the United States. Mr Giuliani was. So, that\u2019s the story.\u201d\n\nSo Giuliani did solicit diGenova\u2019s help in producing Ukraine dirt on Biden. And diGenova implies that some sort of work was done in the early stages of that project but he can\u2019t discuss it because those chats would be privileged. What about Wallace\u2019s claim that this was all being done with Trump\u2019s knowledge? \u201cTotally false,\u201d diGenova said, \u201cThe President was not involved with any of this.\u201d Here\u2019s what Rudy said when he was asked about this today:\n\nOn Monday morning, Giuliani told The Daily Beast that \u201cJoe is absolutely right,\u201d and that President Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t know about this at this point. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even briefed him yet [on this specific matter]\u2026 They weren\u2019t working on the investigation with me. I did the investigation with my people. This was not a matter that was brought to the president\u201d while the trip was being planned. Giuliani said that he had planned to bring \u201cVicki\u201d Toensing with him on the aborted Ukraine trip earlier this year, to offer her services to Ukrainian individuals as independent counsel. When asked if he had told the president about any of this after the trip fell apart, Trump\u2019s personal attorney said \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you what I told the president\u201d and cited privilege.\n\nSo it sounds like Rudy brought diGenova and Toensing in on the effort early, on his own initiative and without Trump\u2019s knowledge \u2014 \u201coff the books,\u201d as it were, just as Rudy\u2019s informal outreach to Ukraine was. Some preliminary work was done but then D&T dropped the matter for whatever reason before it reached the stage of them visiting Ukraine. Trump may have been made aware of their involvement after the fact, though; Giuliani is notably coy about whether POTUS was told of diGenova\u2019s and Toensing\u2019s early participation later on. It would also stand to reason that \u201cThe only person in government who knows what they were doing is President Trump,\u201d as Wallace claimed. If all of this were being done \u201coff the books\u201d via private attorneys, only Rudy\u2019s client, Donald Trump, would know the extent of their involvement.\n\nIn fact, Rudy didn\u2019t need to tell POTUS that diGenova and Toensing were involved in the early stages of the Ukraine outreach. Back in May, when news first broke into public view about Giuliani\u2019s interest in Ukraine, the New York Times reported the couple\u2019s connection to the matter. Quote: \u201cMr. Giuliani has been working on the effort with other allies of Mr. Trump whose involvement has not been previously reported, including Victoria Toensing, a lawyer who was named last year, along with her husband, as part of the legal team representing the president in the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The appointment was rescinded less than one week later amid concerns about conflicts of interest, but Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team suggested that Ms. Toensing and her husband, Joseph E. diGenova, would assist the president \u2018in other legal matters.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll of this jibes with what Wallace reported. Where Wallace went wrong \u2014 again, if diGenova is to be believed \u2014 was in not making clear that diGenova\u2019s and Toensing\u2019s work on the Ukraine matter allegedly ended early, without the two visiting Ukraine or representing any Ukrainian whistleblowers. DiGenova claims that Fox was informed of that but declined to mention it, which amounted to overselling the two\u2019s involvement. All Wallace will say (for now) is that Fox stands by its story. Hmmm.\n\nEven if you take the most diGenova-friendly view of all this, though, it remains a mystery why he was offered to Tucker Carlson\u2019s audience last week as a disinterested legal expert countering Andrew Napolitano\u2019s opinion of whether Trump\u2019s actions were criminal. By his own admission, he was asked by the president\u2019s personal lawyer to represent Ukrainians who might have information on Biden. DiGenova never claims that he turned Rudy down either; to the contrary, the Times story from May says Toensing was working with him, at least for a time. Why was the conflict of interest not mentioned to Fox viewers? That was the whole reason Fox\u2019s news division broke this scoop, I assume \u2014 to expose diGenova\u2019s former work for Giuliani on this matter while he plays dispassionate pundit about it on primetime. Maybe that\u2019s why Wallace stands by the story.", "description": "Spin?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/w-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
