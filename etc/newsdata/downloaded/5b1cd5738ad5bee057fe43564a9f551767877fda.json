It's just utter stupidity, and she is taking out her own negativity.'\n\nMs Reid replied pointing out the customer's own ironic negativity and how much his comments had brought her down.\n\n'I have feelings too and I have the right to ask very politely for my clients to use better etiquette when they are in my cafe,' she wrote.\n\nMs Reid told Daily Mail Australia the man's behaviour was just another example of how rude and inconsiderate a small number of diners were.\n\nStaff pose for a photo inside the shop which has been running since 2012 in central Townsville\n\nMs Reid said the man's behaviour was just another example of how rude and inconsiderate a small number of diners were\n\nShe said at least once a month she would find clipped toenails on the floor of the cafe or even on the furniture.\n\n'That really baffles me, I mean who brings scissors in their bag and cuts them while they wait for their lunch to be made? It's pretty gross,' she said.\n\n'Chewing gum also does my head in. You furnish your shop with nice furniture and someone.\n\n'Also clogging the toilets and walking away. It's not the staff toilets so we don't notice it until one of our customers berates us because the toilets are disgusting.'\n\nMs Reid said someone took three stars off a review because the toilets were left in a state during a very busy lunch rush.\n\n'They said there was a lovely atmosphere, shop was beautiful, staff were friendly, the food was amazing the coffee was great... but the state of the toilets was absolutely disgusting,' she said.\n\nA staff member shows off a tray of baked goods that appear to have been made as a test to develop the best version\n\nMs Reid said at least once a month she would find clipped toenails on the floor of the cafe or even on the furniture\n\nStolen cutlery, plants, and decorations were also rampant because 'people think it's just fine to take what you want, anything is fair game'.\n\nRearranging chairs and tables without permission or thought for others was also a problem - and some even left dirty tissues behind when they left.\n\nBut Ms Reid's biggest gripe was that she was considered rude for telling customers, like the man on the stool, to behave in her own cafe.\n\n'Why are we not allowed to say that we're not happy? Why couldn't I tell him not to put his feet on the chair? So now I'm an inconsiderate moron,' she said.\n\n'If you're asked politely to do something a different way, what's the harm? Why does it rate a one-star review? We don't get the opportunity to review them?'\n\nShe believed social media made people more likely to complain instead of asking staff to fix an issue on the spot.\n\nMs Reid's biggest gripe was that she was considered rude for telling customers, like the man on the stool, to behave in her own cafe\n\nWhen Ms Reid told the man to not put his feet on the stool, he responded that he had a back issue and needed to sit like that, so she suggested he use one of the many comfortable padded chairs in the cafe\n\n'People say whatever they want and don't have to worry about the consequences, it's cowardly,' she said.\n\n'They get instant gratification in saying ''I told them'' when really they didn't have the balls to confront me to my face. Ten years ago you had to think about it.'\n\nMs Reid also believed customer behaviour had worsened over her decades in the hospitality industry.\n\n'Manners and etiquette don't seem to be pushed in school or at home as much as they used to be,' she said.\n\n'My mother would have kicked me in the bum if I did any of this, maybe we aren't passing it down to the next generation.'", "description": "Ann Maree Reid, 51, let loose on boorish customers to her Townsville cafe who put their feet on seats, cut their toenails, and steal cutlery then leave poor reviews online.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/20037892-0-image-a-8_1571752382424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
