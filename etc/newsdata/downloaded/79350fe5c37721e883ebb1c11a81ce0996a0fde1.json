Never did we think he'd be allowed back into the community less than a year after the attack.'\n\n'When he attacked my granddad he had been released from Harplands Hospital six weeks earlier to self medicate because they said he was safe to leave.'\n\nDisbelief: Donna Flynn, Jennifer Clowes and Barbara Morris (left to right) have been left outraged after receiving notification Muguti will be allowed back on the streets\n\nThe assisted living unit in Clayton, Stoke-on-Trent where Muguti carried out the attack on Mr Clowes\n\n'We feel completely and utterly let down by the justice system. How can somebody like that be released back into the public for two hours a week?'\n\n'My dad was a serving police officer and this is how he's being repaid.'\n\nThe family received the letter from the Ministry of Justice on September 9. It came just 11 months after Muguti carried out the attack on October 14 last year.\n\nJohn's wife Jennifer Clowes says the night of the attack was like a 'horror film'.\n\nThe 74-year-old, who has since moved to Baldwins Gate with husband John, said:\n\n'John has dementia and I've had to tell him that Muguti is going to be released and now he's convinced that he is going to come after him. It's brought it all back.'\n\nBarbara Morris, John's neighbour, who was also targeted by Muguti, has also been 'gutted' by the latest news.\n\nShe said: 'At the trial they said he could be dismissed from attending the proceedings because they believed if he heard what had happened it would cause him to react, so how can somebody who was like that five months ago now be allowed in public?'", "description": "GRAPHIC CONTENT: An 'insane' man from Stoke-on-Trent who brutalised retired police officer, John Clowes, 77, will soon walk the streets again after being granted accompanied leave.", "authors": ["John Bennett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/10/19580754-0-image-a-14_1570786146652.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
