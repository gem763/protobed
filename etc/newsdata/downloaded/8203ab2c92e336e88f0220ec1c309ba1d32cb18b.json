The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u201cIt hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u201d She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow. Lauer then asked her if she liked it. She tells him yes. She claims that \u201cshe bled for days\u201d.\u2019\n\nShe reportedly added: \u2018It was non-consensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent. It was non-consensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u2019\n\nBrooke is thought to have told multiple colleagues and superiors at NBC, but nothing was pursued until 2017, when the Today Show host had his contract with NBC terminated over the allegations.\n\nLauer has denied all the claims, branding the accusations \u2018categorically false\u2019 and insisting himself and Brooke had a \u2018consensual\u2019 affair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a lengthy statement, he said: \u2018In a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault. It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\n\n\u2018I had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts.\n\n\u2018We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual.\n\n\u2018The story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter. Nothing could be further from the truth.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
