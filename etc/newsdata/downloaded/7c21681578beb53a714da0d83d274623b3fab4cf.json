Of the \u00a31.8bn it already makes from products other than cigarettes, \u00a3318m comes from vaping.\n\nBAT declined to comment on whether Trump\u2019s plans could punch a hole in its \u00a35bn revenue target for \u201cpotentially reduced-risk products\u201d.\n\nThe company said: \u201cWe welcome the Trump administration and the FDA shining a spotlight on the important issue of youth access to vapour products. We have always been clear that youth should not use vapour products and have had stringent measures in place to address this for some time.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\u201cWe share President Trump\u2019s concern that some flavours, such as those resembling \u2018kid-friendly\u2019 food products, may play a role in increasing youth appeal and that marketing activities should not be directed to youth.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that we do not market such vapour flavours and in fact we have supported measures to remove vapour products intended to mimic children\u2019s food products or otherwise designed to target youth, and have procedures in place to ensure our products are only marketed to adult tobacco consumers.\u201d\n\nBAT said it would continue to work with the FDA but made no mention of concern among US health professionals about potential links between vaping and lung disease.", "description": "Company aims to increase revenues from \u2018potentially reduced-risk products\u2019 to \u00a35bn", "authors": ["Rob Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed1ba917df0bfbdb664f09d5b787f3ca01986984/0_23_1812_1087/master/1812.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f69f9a0ebe471ac51aed9f84d80586c7", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
