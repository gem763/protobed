American forces must realise [they] will never win the war by killing innocent civilians,\u201d said Javed Mansur, who lives in Jalalabad city.\n\nIsis fighters first appeared in Afghanistan in 2014 and have since made inroads in the east and north where they are battling the government, US forces and the Taliban.\n\nThe exact number of Isis fighters is difficult to calculate because they frequently switch allegiances, but the US military estimates there are about 2,000.\n\nThere has been no let-up in assaults by Taliban and Isis as Afghanistan prepares for a presidential election this month.\n\nIn a separate incident, at least 20 people died in a suicide truck bomb attack on Thursday carried out by the Taliban in the southern province of Zabul.\n\nHundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting across Afghanistan after the collapse of US-Taliban peace talks this month. The Taliban has warned Donald Trump will regret his decision to abruptly call off talks that could have led to a political settlement to end the 18-year-old war.\n\nThe United Nations says nearly 4,000 civilians were killed or wounded in the first half of the year. That included a big increase in casualties inflicted by government and US-led foreign forces.", "description": "Forty were also injured in the Wednesday attack which struck farmers and labourers who just finished work, Afghan officials say", "authors": ["Reuters In Jalalabad"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a37bf21bed467dafd3047fa18e8cd00b7586536/0_267_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d2fa00f21362f9e02929bc4154f493d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
