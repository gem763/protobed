So is the pressure of making lunch boxes just an issue for kids at private schools or in other words \u2013 rich families?\n\nA tool of communication\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue is: lunch boxes are not just for young children in Japan. According to a recent survey, many senior high school students (aged 15 to 18) still bring home-cooked lunch boxes to school, and the majority of them are made by their mothers.\n\nBut according to Risako, who has been making bento for 10 years and plans to continue making them until her daughter is 18, it\u2019s about building the relationship between mothers and children.\n\n\u201cWhen rebellious teenagers often stop talking to their parents, by eating their mothers\u2019 food, they still feel the love and be grateful,\u201d she says. \u201cI also ask my daughter what she liked most in the lunch box, so it\u2019s a communication tool.\u201d\n\nThere is widespread consensus in Japan that home-cooked food is healthier than store-bought \u2013 another reason why Japanese mothers still prepare their teenage children\u2019s lunch boxes.", "description": "Working mothers have it tough in Japan \u2013 creating Instagram-worthy, healthy lunches is one of many pressures they say they face", "authors": ["Mariko Oi"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7q/yn/p07qyngc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
