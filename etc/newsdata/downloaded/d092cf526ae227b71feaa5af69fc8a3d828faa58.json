Joseph Votel, who led US Central Command during the campaign against ISIS, wrote in The Atlantic on Tuesday, \"Eventually, the YPG became the backbone of the fighting force against ISIS in Syria. Without it, President Donald Trump could not have declared the complete defeat of ISIS.\"\n\nKurdish forces control the northeastern part of Syria, as well as a sliver of land north of Aleppo. However, after Trump decided to abandon Syrian Kurds, who are under imminent threat of attack by Turkey, that territory may change.\n\nTurkish forces control a few scattered bits of land near the Syrian city of Aleppo, as well as a strip along the Syrian border, south of the Turkish city of Gaziantep.\n\nTurkey has been critical of the SDF, seeing it as allied with the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which is based in Turkey and Iraq.\n\nThe PKK has clashed with the Turkish government, which in the past prohibited Turkish Kurds from speaking their language or expressing their ethnic identity at all.\n\nSeveral times since its founding in the 1970s, the PKK's demands for autonomy within Turkey have turned violent, causing many governments, including Turkey and the US, to label the PKK a terrorist organisation.\n\nAccording to the BBC, approximately 40,000 people have died in the conflict between Turkey and the PKK.\n\nIn northeastern Syria, Turkey has established a \"safe zone\" where it can resettle Syrian refugees who fled the civil war and create a buffer between itself and Kurdish forces. The US agreed to the safe zone, but with a sudden absence of US forces, it's not clear how far Turkey intends to push into Syria, Reuters reports.\n\nAssad regime forces hold most of Syria.\n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad, with significant support from Russia, Iran, and the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah, has fought to regain control of significant parts of Syria.\n\nThe regime controlled only a portion of western Syria in 2015, as the ISIS presence grew there.\n\nAssad has vowed to retake \"every inch\" of Syria, but during his campaign civilians have suffered brutal attacks, including the use of chemical weapons.\n\nSome 11 million Syrians have been displaced inside and outside the country during the conflict, and more than 500,000 have keen killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nOther, smaller pieces of the country are held by groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which holds territory in the northwest.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) was founded as Jabhat al-Nusra around the start of the Syrian civil war.\n\nIt announced its split from from al-Qaeda in 2017, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, although the US and the UN said as recently as last year that HTS was still linked with al-Qaeda.\n\nHTS's raison d'etre is to topple the Assad regime and establish an Islamic emirate in Syria, according to the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford.\n\n\"HTS is seen as extreme and authoritarian,\" Mouas Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, told PBS NewsHour. \"The fact that the regime continues to target civilians is one reason HTS is tolerated, but as soon as there is a lull in violence, populations go back to protesting HTS.\"", "description": "The post-ISIS map of territorial control in Syria shows the Assad regime and Kurdish forces as the major players in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1784/9f1e668698404e28b4f9c68c44646241.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
