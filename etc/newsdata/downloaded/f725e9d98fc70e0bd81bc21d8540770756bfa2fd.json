In Tuesday\u2019s European session, the metal is trading at 17.70, down $0.15 or 0.86% on the day. After a late-week rally, the metal has reversed directions and is down 2.0% this week.\n\nAhead \u2013 GDP and the Federal Reserve\n\nInvestors are keeping an eye on Wednesday, with some key releases on the calendar. The U.S. will release the initial release for third-quarter GDP. The final reading for second-quarter GDP came in at 2.0%, and the markets are braced for a weak reading, with a forecast of just 1.6%. The U.S. economy is clearly undergoing a slowdown. The manufacturing industry continues to sputter as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war as taken a toll on U.S. exports.\n\nAnother key event is the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary decision. The Fed trimmed rates by 25 basis points at the last two meetings, and policymakers are expected to repeat this move on Wednesday, bringing rates to a range between 1.50% and 1.75%. The FOMC has priced in the likelihood of a rate cut at 96%. Still, the markets could react, given the magnitude of a third consecutive cut. This could translate into gains for precious metals such as gold and silver, as the Fed continues to cut rates in an attempt to boost the U.S. economy, which is undergoing a slowdown.\n\nSilver Technical Analysis\n\nSilver tested resistance at the 18.00 line on Monday but has retreated in Tuesday trade. The trend has been down this week, but with the 50-EMA providing support at 17.52, there may not be much room for the current downward trend to continue. I continue to keep an eye on the 18.00 line, which remains vulnerable. On the downside, there is support at 17.00, followed by the 200-EMA at $16.37.\n\n[fx-image src=https://www.tradingview.com/x/hIKajZmA/ originalWidth=1347 ratio=1.76 data-zoom-target=https://www.tradingview.com/x/hIKajZmA/]\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Silver took a shot at the $18.00 level on Monday, but has retreated on Tuesday.
