Instead of pursuing those petty courtroom battles, he broke off his legal studies and began a literary career full of confrontation. His generation had so much to argue with. Unlike German language authors before him, such as G\u00fcnther Grass and Heinrich B\u00f6ll \u2013 the latter Handke vehemently spoke out against when he burst onto the scene with his 1966 debut novel The Hornets \u2013 Handke seemed to pick a fight with language itself. For him, and his contemporaries Elfriede Jelinek and Thomas Bernhard, the entire German language bore the stain of Nazi abuse and needed to be recovered, word by word.\n\nOlga Tokarczuk and Peter Handke win Nobel prizes in literature Read more\n\nI still remember the experience of seeing his 1966 play Publikumsbeschimpfung, in Berlin in the seventies. In English translation it was called Offending the Audience \u2013 though the word \u201cberating\u201d seems more appropriate for a play made up of actors doing nothing but shouting at shocked and inspired audiences. He followed it up with Kaspar, a 1967 play based on the legend of Kaspar Hauser, the man who stumbled onto the streets of Nuremberg without any grasp of language. Handke\u2019s characters attempt to speak, but their fight with words make them even more mute; it is as though they have become part of a post-Holocaust condition in which the world must rebuild everything, even linguistics, from scratch.\n\nHis striking titles have always pointed inwards at his own tumultuous, hugely original, and fearless literary force, like his more recent play, 2010\u2019s Immer noch Sturm (Storm Still). His characters are often brought into the psychological laboratory to be tested for emotional inhibitors: like the central figure in 1972\u2019s The Goalie\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, who descends into a traumatised moral vacuum to coldly murder a cinema cashier. (The novel was later filmed by Wim Wenders in 1975; Handke\u2019s own film career would begin in three years after that, when he directed an adaptation of his own novel The Left-Handed Woman.)\n\nHandke turned to more personal subjects in books like his 1972 novel Wunschloses Ungl\u00fcck (Sorrow Beyond Dreams), in which he wrote \u2013 without overt emotion \u2013 about the suicide of his Slovenian-born mother. She is described, not from the point of view of a son in mourning, but simply as the story of a woman who methodically lays out her clothes before calmly taking her own life.\n\nSince then, his novels have continued that extraordinary life work of discovering human existence with forensic analysis, writing about all manner of subjects and attempting to explain them to us. An attempt by the author to travel deep into the landscape to find himself, an attempt at mushroom hunting, even an attempt at understanding the toilet.\n\nIt was a shock to see him taking up the cause of the Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, going so far as to attend his trial in the Hague and later, his funeral. Perhaps it can be vaguely explained, if not forgiven, as part of Handke\u2019s need to be awkward and wrong, that artistic impulse to uncover the hornet\u2019s nest and get stung himself.\n\nHow will his fellow citizens in Austria view their latest controversial laureate, I wonder. When his compatriot Elfriede Jelinek won the prize some years ago, the Vienna tabloids blazed their fury and called her a Nestbeschmutzerin or \u201csoiler of her own nest.\u201d Will they do the same to Handke?\n\n\u2022 Hugo Hamilton\u2019s latest novel is Dublin Palms (Fourth Estate).", "description": "Since his 1966 debut The Hornets, the Austrian playwright and author has tested, inspired and shocked audiences", "authors": ["Hugo Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a59e24043dcbc4a5d95eaae181d76ddb6c6535f0/0_57_2976_1786/master/2976.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fb66c32de29b6552043d27dceaa947f7", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
