The first step involves the referee bringing play to a halt and making an announcement over the PA system, insisting that the behaviour stop immediately.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIf the abuse continues once the game has restarted, the referee will suspend the match for a \u201creasonable period of time\u201d and both teams will return to the dressing rooms. The third and final step sees the referee abandon the match entirely.\n\nIt is understood that England players will attempt to follow the Uefa protocol in the event of any abuse but, as Abraham confirmed, the players are ready to walk off of their own accord if they feel it is the right thing to do.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Picking England's XI and squad for Euro 2020 1/24 England XI and squad for Euro 2020 Gareth Southgate has the most exciting front line of a generation but has decisions to make in defence and midfield PA 2/24 Bench - Nick Pope The Burnley goalkeeper is an excellent shot-stopper and a very competent backup to Pickford. Getty Images 3/24 Bench - Tom Heaton Another extremely good shot-stopper, Heaton would also be a reliable option to call upon if injuries struck. Action Images via Reuters 4/24 Bench - Kyle Walker Walker\u2019s pace is his best asset, but he has proved at Man City that he is capable of playing in a technical set up. His attributes over that of Aaron Wan-Bissaka are more suited to Southgate\u2019s style of play. Action Images via Reuters 5/24 Bench - Joe Gomez Gomez has been very unlucky with injury, and needs a run of games to remind people that he is a very good centre-back. He is capable of defending, reading the game and at playing out from the back. AFP/Getty Images 6/24 Bench - James Tarkowski His clubmate Ben Mee has somehow alluded an international call up, but Tarkowski is a very talented defender who delivers a 7/10 minimum in almost every game. Action Images via Reuters 7/24 Bench - James Tarkowski Chilwell is still developing as a left-back at Leicester and is good, without excelling, both defensively and offensively. REUTERS 8/24 Bench - Declan Rice Rice is another who\u2019s enjoyed a quick rise to the England squad, and is a promising ball-winning midfielder. Without having top-level experience it is hard to argue for him to start over Henderson. Action Images via Reuters 9/24 Bench - Mason Mount Mount, despite his age, has demonstrated his game-changing ability and possesses excellent decision-making ability that earmarks him ahead of more experienced midfielders. REUTERS 10/24 Bench - James Maddison Maddison perhaps operates best as a no.10, a position Southgate has not really used. However, his playmaking and set-piece abilities are a valuable weapon off of the bench despite not yet being capped. REUTERS 11/24 Bench - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Another who needs to prove his fitness to remind people of his talent, Oxlade-Chamberlain is quick, can beat a man, and is capable of playing most midfield positions. Getty Images 12/24 Bench - Callum Hudson-Odoi Hudson-Odoi has displayed a lot of ability in his short career at club and international level, and is another who is an excellent option to have from the bench. Action Images via Reuters 13/24 Bench - Marcus Rashford Rashford\u2019s role in this squad is to provide coverage across the front line, and his pace and attacking versatility could prove very valuable later in the tournament. Getty Images 14/24 GK - Jordan Pickford Pickford has not quite progressed at the rate many thought he would when he first signed for Everton, but he remains a good stopper and his distribution is a useful tool for Southgate. EPA 15/24 RB - Trent Alexander-Arnold Although he is less defensively capable than his right-back contemporaries, Alexander-Arnold\u2019s technical and set-piece abilities are a weapon that England should look to exploit. REUTERS 16/24 CB - Harry Maguire Despite giving away a penalty against Kosovo, Maguire is the most \u2018solid\u2019 out of England\u2019s centre-backs and his aerial presence in both boxes can be game-changing. Action Images via Reuters 17/24 CB - John Stones Centre-back has been England\u2019s Achilles heel for several years, with all of the candidates looking error-prone at times. Stones has experience and ball-playing ability on his side, which suits Southgate\u2019s style of play. PA 18/24 LB - Danny Rose Rose gets the nod over Ben Chilwell because he is slightly more athletic and defensively capable and has the advantage of playing for a top club, making him more suited to the intensity of tournament football. Getty Images 19/24 DM - Jordan Henderson Although he has box-to-box capabilities, Henderson\u2019s ability to sit back and allow other players to be more creative is invaluable and his contributions often go undervalued. Action Images via Reuters 20/24 CM - Ruben Loftus-Cheek Despite being currently injured, Loftus-Cheek at his peak is a devastating midfielder and has a fantastic talent for carrying the ball between the lines. Having said that, he must get fit and start regularly for Chelsea soon. REUTERS 21/24 CM - Dele Alli When England (hopefully) advance to the latter stages, they are likely to line up more defensively, but the dual threat of Alli and Loftus-Cheek in the final third could be very potent for the Three Lions. Getty 22/24 LW - Raheem Sterling Sterling has been in world-class form for the last two seasons and is one of the first names on the teamsheet. Playing in his favoured position on the left allows him to replicate his phenomenal performances for Manchester City. EPA 23/24 RW - Jadon Sancho Sancho is another who possesses frightening natural ability, but is equally capable of coming inside and playing quick passes as he is beating someone for pace and driving in a cross and should be a sure starter next summer. Getty 24/24 ST - Harry Kane Captain Kane is England\u2019s only striker who plays at a high level for club, with Marcus Rashford preferred out wide for United.

Kane has already demonstrated his scoring potential at a major tournament... Getty\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve touched base on how to deal with the situation,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cHarry Kane even said that if it happens and we\u2019re not happy with it, we speak to player and if he\u2019s not happy, we all come off the pitch together. It\u2019s a team thing. Don\u2019t isolate one person, we\u2019re a whole team. If it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.\n\n\u201cWe did speak about that. Harry Kane did ask the question about instead of going through the three steps, if we decide that we want to stop the game and we want to stop the game \u2013 no matter what the score is \u2013 if we\u2019re not happy with it, as a team we\u2019ll decide whether or not to stay on the pitch.\n\n\u201cI do [think it could happen]. Watching the gaffer speaking yesterday, he was quite keen on putting a stop to it. No one wants it in football. It\u2019s not just affecting one person, it\u2019s affecting the team. It\u2019s a team decision if we decide in the end that we don\u2019t want to play this game anymore because of what\u2019s going on, we\u2019ll come off as a team.\u201d\n\nAbraham added: \u201cI think if that happens and we do decide to leave the field, obviously it\u2019s serious. We\u2019d just let the FA or whoever deal with whatever\u2019s next, the scores or what happens with the points. At the time, it\u2019s about making sure we\u2019re a team. We don\u2019t stand for it and we want the world to see that, that we don\u2019t stand for the silly abuse.\u201d\n\nThe game in Sofia next Monday will be played in front of a reduced crowd after Bulgaria were found guilty of racist behaviour during their June qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Kosovo, while several black England players were abused during a 5-1 win over Montenegro in Podgorica earlier this year.\n\nAbraham suggested that Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol was not strong enough and that \u201cone strike\u201d should be enough, although he reiterated that England will attempt to follow the process and only \u201cmake a decision\u201d if required.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, I think it\u2019s just one strike because it gives people excuses,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cOne time, twice, three times \u2013 it gives silly people excuses. Like we were all saying yesterday, if it happens and let\u2019s say there\u2019s a warning or whatever in the stadium, then it happens again, we have to make a decision as a team and with the staff.\u201d\n\nAbraham was subjected to racist abuse online in August after missing a decisive penalty in Chelsea\u2019s Super Cup defeat to Liverpool. \u201cI think I dealt with it in the best way possible,\u201d the Premier League\u2019s joint top scorer said.\n\n\u201cI just stayed away from Twitter and all social media, I just spent time with my team-mates and my family. Everyone saw it, everyone was aware of what was happening. Like I said, I spoke many times about it. It\u2019s not acceptable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse for people to hide behind computers and say whatever they want to say. But whoever doesn\u2019t have my personality might be affected more. Like I said, I think I dealt with it the best way. I stayed away, ignored it and just let the football do the talking.\u201d", "description": "Tammy Abraham has said that England\u2019s\u00a0players are prepared to walk off the pitch in their forthcoming European Championship qualifiers if subjected to racial abuse, regardless of Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol.", "authors": ["Mark Critchley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/19/tammy-abraham.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
