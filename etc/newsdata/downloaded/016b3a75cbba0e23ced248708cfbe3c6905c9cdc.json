With her simple, likeable and totally relatable roles, Deepti Naval, her subtle performances struck a chord with the audiences. But did she get the recognition that she deserved?\n\nAfter a four-decade-long career in the industry, Deepti Naval talks about the struggles, heartbreaks, disappointments and frustrations she has been through. She says she didn\u2019t follow the trend and she is proud of that fact. However, she did face a lot of ups and down and that it was disappointing when a serious actor was ignored by the Indian cinema.\n\nTwitter\n\nThe veteran actor is thankful that she never became \"convoluted\" during the highs and lows. Despite being advised to do roles in commercial cinema, Deepti Naval spearheaded her career in parallel cinema that she was told \u201cno one watches.\u201d But she still, starred in movies like Chashme Buddoor, Ankahee, Mirch Masala in the \u201880s.\n\nTwitter\n\nDon't Miss 139 SHARES 20 K SHARES 4.4 K SHARES 7.2 K SHARES 2.6 K SHARES\n\nShe most recently starred in Amazon Prime\u2019s Made In Heaven. \"Every decade there's a new trend of films. Something else is more liked by the audience, something else is more popular. People say you need to realign your career with the new, of course, but you have to basically stick to what you believe in doing,\" Naval told PTI.\n\nTwitter\n\n\"You've to stand for the work that you do. The trend in cinema will keep changing, but do the kind of work you want to do within that changing scenario, keep picking what convinces you,\" she adds.\n\nTwitter\n\nTalking about the ups and downs in her four-decade-long career, the 67-year-old actress said, \"I have gone through mine, when I felt the kind of cinema I want to be a part of isn't there at all. The 80s were marvellous, splendid years for all of us- Shabana (Azmi), Me, Smita Patil, Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, Farooq Shaikh, we did our best work then.\n\n\"Then in the 90s there was some lucky work coming along but after that, somewhere in the late 90s, I felt that not much is happening and I was not getting the stuff I wanted to do.\"\n\npinimg.com\n\nShe says the lean period she experienced could have hit her hard if she hadn\u2019t branched out to find more outlets of creativity.\n\n\"I had been writing throughout for a long but (during that phase) I went back to painting in a major way because I felt I have to be creative at all costs, under all circumstances whatever it is. My creative process shouldn't stop.\n\n\"Because I had other means of expressions, I was lucky that I didnt go under and start becoming all convoluted in my head. That can happen, if you're a serious actor and you're here to really be a part of cinema, and when cinema ignores you, it can be devastating,\" she says.\n\nTwitter\n\nFor Deepti Naval, the phase lasted for a few years before she picked up steam again with films like Firaaq, Memories of March and Listen Amaya.\n\n\"My painting and writing has always been parallel. That's why probably where my colleagues have done 300 films, I have done only about a 100, out of which I'd say at least 30-35 films I am even proud of.\"\n\n\"You can't be in the industry without your share of heartbreaks, disappointments, and frustrations also. But as long as you're able to stick to your guts and pick the roles you really want to do, the whole journey becomes worthwhile,\" she added. Naval was recently honoured with Excellence in Cinema award at the JIO MAMI Mumbai Festival with Star.\n\nWith inputs from PTI", "description": "After a four-decade-long career in the industry, Deepti Naval talks about the struggles, heartbreaks, disappointments and frustrations she has been through.
