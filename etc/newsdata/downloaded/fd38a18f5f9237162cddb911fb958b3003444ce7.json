It was the first cut in the CCyB ratio since it was introduced in 2015.\n\n\u201cEconomic indicators and other relevant evidence have signaled that the economic environment in Hong Kong has deteriorated significantly since June 2019,\u201d HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said in the statement.\n\n\u201cLowering the countercyclical capital buffer at this juncture will allow banks to be more supportive to the domestic economy and help mitigate the economic cycle,\u201d Yue added.\n\nHong Kong, which has been rocked by four months of often huge and violent protests against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the Chinese-ruled city, is facing its first recession in a decade.\n\nThe economy shrank 0.4% in April-June from the previous quarter, revised government data showed on Friday, and conditions have sharply deteriorated since then.\n\nThe Asian financial center, which also has one of the world\u2019s busiest ports, was already under intense pressure from the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war and China\u2019s biggest economic slowdown in decades.\n\nHKMA has recently denied rumors, circulating on social media platforms and messaging apps, which have raised concerns about the monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe have emphasized many times that Hong Kong\u2019s banking system is robust and sound, with strong capital positions, ample liquidity and good asset quality,\u201d Yue said in his blog on Monday. \u201cIt is well positioned to withstand market shocks.\u201d\n\nThe CCyB was introduced in line with international standards in 2015, ensuring adequate capital buffer for banks which can be deployed during an economic downturn to boost credit growth.", "description": "The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has cut the amount of cash that banks must keep as reserves, releasing an extra HK$200-300 billion ($25.50-38.24 billion) into the broader economy which has been hit by months-long protests and the Sino-U.S. trade war.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
