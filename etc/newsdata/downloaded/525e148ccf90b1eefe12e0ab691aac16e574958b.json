Offering services to the underserved \u2014 unbanked consumers who lack access to banking products, and underbanked consumers who make only limited use of mainstream financial services \u2014 has long been economically unviable. But two forces have flipped the conversation from CSR to a genuine business opportunity. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nFirst, digital tools from mobile banking to AI are driving down costs and allowing financial institutions (FIs) to offer previously untenable products, such as fee-free accounts or credit scoring based on unconventional data.\n\nSecond, the US' financial landscape is more competitive than ever, as fintechs, incumbents, and even tech companies like Amazon vie for larger shares of the overall space. That's creating a compelling reason for banks to seek out fresh growth opportunities, and the financially underserved represent just that. And with close to 33 million US households either unbanked or underbanked, the opportunity for fast-moving banks is huge.\n\nIn Fintech and Financial Inclusion, Business Insider Intelligence explores the business opportunity for incumbent banks looking to tap the growing opportunity presented by the financially underserved, highlights through case studies how innovative players are utilizing technology to capture share in this market, and outlines recommendations for how banks can enter the space as well.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report are: Amazon, BBVA, Chime, Citi Bank, Experian, FICO, LendingClub, Petal, and Synchrony.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nDespite the US being one of the most developed financial ecosystems in the world, a quarter of households in the country make little or no use of mainstream banking products.\n\nSeveral barriers have stymied underserved consumers' adoption of mainstream banking products, both from the consumer and FI perspective.\n\nInnovation in digital banking channels has helped reduce some of these barriers to adoption, making financial products viable for consumers and FIs alike.\n\nBanks planning to target consumers that are financially underserved need to consider a number of factors, including product fit, financial literacy, and how they measure metrics for assessing of a financial inclusion effort.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nDetails the key reasons why millions of US households are either unbanked or underbanked.\n\nForecasts the market opportunity of serving this group.\n\nExplores how seven players have leveraged technology to tap into this lucrative market \u2014 Citi Bank, Chime, BBVA, LendingClub, Petal, Amazon, and Synchrony Financial.\n\nProvides actionable recommendations for how banks can successfully pursue a financial inclusion project.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
