While it may be hard for some to buy bras in Japan, there\u2019s nothing that should stop you from taking care of your breast health.\n\nLadyknows Fes 2019\n\nOctober is Breast Cancer Awareness month, and from now until Friday, Oct. 11, Ladyknows Fes 2019 will be taking place at Trunk by Shoto Gallery in Shibuya. This event is designed for women to join together to learn about and how to manage their overall health\u2014both mental and physical.\n\nAccording to their (and government research), nearly 40 percent of women in their 20s, and almost 45 percent of women in their 30s in Japan have not (or do not) get their annual physical examinations. In comparison, both rates are higher than men in Japan who do not get regularly screened. These health screenings are so vital, especially for women, because female-specific cancers, such as breast cancer or cervical cancer, can be detected here in its earlier stages. Unfortunately, however, many women in Japan don\u2019t get their physical examinations done, meaning early detection of breast cancer is scarce.\n\nbreast cancer remains the number one leading cause of death of women in Japan aged 30-64.\n\nIn fact, an older friend of mine had never even considered getting checked until Empress Emerita Michiko had surgery for breast cancer in September. \u201cIt never crossed my mind that my breasts could harbor something that could kill me.\u201d (Junko, Japanese, 53)\n\nBreast Cancer Statistics in Japan\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Registry Summary published by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, a near one million new cases of cancer were found in Japan in 2016. Women made up almost half of those cases and breast cancer was the most prevalent type, making up 20 percent of all female cases. What is even more terrifying is that the rate of women who lose their lives to breast cancer in Japan is continually increasing: 14,285 women lost the dreaded fight against breast cancer just last year, a number that is more than three times what it was 35 years ago. Consequently, according to the Japan Cancer Society, breast cancer remains the number one leading cause of death of women in Japan aged 30-64.\n\nBut there is hope! Based on a report done by Japan\u2019s National Cancer Center, if breast cancer can be detected early on, there is a three-year survival rate of nearly 100 percent for stage I breast cancer in men and women. The rate remains extremely high at 98 percent for stage II breast cancer and over 80 percent for stage III breast cancer.\n\nKnow The Symptoms\n\nIf you have any of the following symptoms, you should make an appointment with your doctor right away:\n\nAny skin changes in one/both breasts (swelling, redness, pitting of skin similar to an orange peel, skin irritation, itchiness, overall color)\n\nChanges to one or both nipples (discharge other than milk, discoloration, peeling or flaking of the skin, sudden inversion)\n\nA sudden increase in breast size or shape\n\nChange in touch (feels hard or warmer than usual)\n\nThe presence of any lumps, nodes or otherwise hard/thick \u2018bumps\u2019 in or around the breast tissue\n\nIf you have one or more of the above symptoms, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have breast cancer, but they are symptoms that every woman should be aware of and quickly get checked out.\n\nThis anecdote from an American friend might help convince you to get these symptoms checked: \u201cMy mother got this weird rash across her chest and it wouldn\u2019t go away so she went to the hospital. The doctor there told her it was dermatitis (skin irritation from a new body soap), but during the exam, he spotted something not normal with her breast. Long story short, stage II breast cancer was spotted in time and my mother is fine now.\u201d\n\nWhen Should You Get Checked?\n\nWomen of all nationalities over 20 years old should familiarize themselves with their breast health\u2014giving yourself a biannual self-breast exam is generally considered enough at this age.\n\nFor women in their 30s who have no family history of breast cancer, most doctors believe that regular self-checks and screenings every two to three years is reasonable enough. If you are over the age of thirty, have not had children, and have a family history of breast cancer, then you should inform your doctor of this and they will tailor an exam schedule to best suit you. For some women, this may mean screenings every year, while for others, it may be every six months.\n\nFor women aged 45 and over, screenings should be done every year (for those with a family history of it) and every other year for women without a family history.\n\nWhere To Get Checked\n\nIn Tokyo and the surrounding areas, those who are part of the National Health Insurance plan can be undertaken at any cancer clinic or hospital, and often costs less than \u00a52,000. In Kawasaki, for example, you may qualify to receive a voucher for a free cervical and breast cancer screening.
