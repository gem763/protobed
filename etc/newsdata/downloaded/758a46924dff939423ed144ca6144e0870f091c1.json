Money, sex, and struggle, Mad Libs\u2013style. The \u201cI\u2019m a young CEO\u201d conceit of his signature hit, \u201cSuge,\u201d for example, wasn\u2019t exactly groundbreaking, but DaBaby\u2019s high-word-count approach afforded a lot of room for personality. He\u2019s hilarious and callous and clear about the social contexts of his domination, as when he sketches out this Modern Love column: \u201cShe\u2019ll send me a text and then delete the message / He tryna find out, it\u2019s confusin\u2019.\u201d I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s confusin\u2019 is so funny, but it is, every time. The video features him as a mailman gone rogue, dancing with his delivery dolly and peeing on doorsteps. Such simple, irrepressible slapstick\u2014think live-action, PG-13 versions of Sunday-morning cartoons\u2014marks most of his visuals.\n\nHis second album in a year seeks to capitalize on his hot streak. It brings in a slew of notable guest vocalists (including Minaj, Gucci Mane, Chance the Rapper, and his fellow hot baby Lil Baby) and pairs DaBaby with some novel-to-him beats. But in doing so, it mostly confirms\u2014and is almost overwhelmed by\u2014what he does best. \u201cIntro,\u201d a reflection about his father dying right at the moment of his son\u2019s breakout success, conjures some rare gravitas, with a hushed backing and solemn sentiments. Yet DaBaby raps as speedily and smoothly as ever, for a familiar hypnotic effect. \u201cThinkin\u2019 \u2018bout my grandma and shit,\u201d goes the first line, tipping off the level of vagueness he\u2019s working at when trying to be vulnerable. In the stylish but touching music video, friends and family bond in majestically filmed ATVs.\n\nKirk perks up with \u201cOff the Rip,\u201d which acknowledges his main sonic gimmick\u2014\u201cStraight off the rip, you know I don\u2019t wait for the drop\u201d\u2014and spirals out into a nice display of talent that forgoes any chorus. By contrast, the titles of the subsequent three tracks openly announce radio-conquering intentions: \u201cBop,\u201d \u201cVibez,\u201d \u201cPop Star.\u201d DaBaby\u2019s self-awareness, whether courting respect or popularity, is thick. On \u201cBop,\u201d he goes, \u201cAyy, when you gon\u2019 switch the flow? I thought you\u2019d never ask,\u201d addressing the prime criticism he receives, for monotonousness. Sure enough, the flow varies a number of times on Kirk: DaBaby affects trendy slurriness on \u201ciPhone,\u201d creeps against a moody instrumental on \u201cThere He Go,\u201d and, most excitingly, performs a verbal balancing act against the tricky rhythms of \u201cReally.\u201d But these read as only mild departures. His voice and tics are just so strong, so signature.\n\nThat\u2019s fine for now, because no one else sounds like him\u2014though there are, of course, comparisons that can be made. The drawls of Gucci Mane and Kevin Gates, who is also featured on Kirk, seem like big influences. He clearly admires the current women of rap, too: Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s \u201cCash Shit\u201d featured DaBaby essentially rewriting the Kama Sutra; Minaj gets a kaleidoscopic turn on Kirk\u2019s \u201ciPhone\u201d; and Cardi B references abound on \u201cVibez,\u201d whose chorus resembles \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d The affinity between DaBaby and these rappers makes sense, as they share a hard-edged playfulness and intoxicating way of shout-rapping. There\u2019s also the case to be made that he inverts the energy of pop moaners such as Post Malone: DaBaby\u2019s raps coat the ear too, but they also keep you awake.", "description": "The North Carolina artist\u2019s second album in a year, Kirk, confirms that no one does what he does, and that he does a lot of it.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19175058979912/facebook.jpg?1569953561", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
