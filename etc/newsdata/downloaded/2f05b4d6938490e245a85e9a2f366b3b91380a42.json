Liu is scheduled to meet Trump at the White House at 2:45 p.m. EDT (1845 GMT), according to the White House public schedule.\n\n\"Good things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days. I will be meeting with the Vice Premier today. All would like to see something significant happen!\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nBloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter, reported the two sides had reached a partial agreement that would broker a truce in the trade war and lay the groundwork for a broader deal that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could sign later this year.\n\nThe White House did not confirm the report.\n\nMajor U.S. stock indexes were trading sharply higher on Friday on hopes the talks would produce some sort of a deal, with the S&P 500 index up about 1.6%. The MSCI world equity index also jumped.\n\nAsked whether investors were right to be hopeful, Mnuchin told reporters at the White House \"the stock market is always right.\" He noted that Trump would be briefed on the outcome of the talks before his scheduled meeting with Liu.\n\nChina extended an official invite to Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and their teams for trade talks in China ahead of next month's APEC summit, a CNN reporter tweeted.\n\nA Chinese state newspaper said on Friday that a \"partial\" trade deal would benefit China and the United States, and that Washington should take the offer, reflecting Beijing's aim of cooling the row before more tariffs kick in.\n\nBoth sides have slapped duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods during the dispute, and Trump is threatening to raise tariffs to 30% from 25% on about $250 billion in Chinese goods on Oct. 15 if there is no progress on a deal.\n\nOn Thursday, Liu said China is willing to reach agreement with the United States on matters that both sides care about so as to prevent friction from leading to further escalation of the trade war. He stressed that \"the Chinese side came with great sincerity.\"\n\nAdding to that, the official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial in English on Friday: \"A partial deal is a more feasible objective\".\n\n\"Not only would it be of tangible benefit by breaking the impasse, but it would also create badly needed breathing space for both sides to reflect on the bigger picture,\" the paper said.\n\nTrump has previously insisted he would not be satisfied with a partial deal to resolve his two-year effort to change China's trade, intellectual property and industrial policy practices, which he argues cost millions of U.S. jobs.\n\nInvestors and business groups, however, saw China's dangling of a partial deal as a sign of progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHINA'S ACTIONS\n\nChina's securities regulator on Friday also unveiled a firm timetable for scrapping foreign ownership limits in futures, securities and mutual fund companies for the first time. Increasing foreign access to the sector is among the U.S. demands at the trade talks.\n\nBeijing previously said it would further open up its financial sector on its own terms and at its own pace.\n\nChinese officials also are offering to increase annual purchases of U.S. agricultural products, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday confirmed net sales of 142,172 tonnes of U.S. pork to China in the week ended Oct. 3, the largest weekly sale to the world's top pork market on record.\n\nA U.S.-China currency agreement is also being floated as a symbol of progress in talks between the world's two largest economies, although that would largely repeat past pledges by China, currency experts say, and will not change the dollar-yuan relationship that has been a thorn in Trump's side.\n\nStory continues", "description": "WASHINGTON/BEIJING, Oct 11 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials on Friday signalled good news was coming in trade talks with China, while Beijing indicated it was open to a \"partial\" deal that would avoid a planned hike in tariffs on its goods.
