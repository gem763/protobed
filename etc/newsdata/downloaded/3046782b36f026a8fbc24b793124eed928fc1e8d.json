I don\u2019t blame you if you\u2019re currently wandering around in the woods, staring up at the trees, listening to the melancholy whistle of the September wind, and wondering what\u2019s the point of watching football anymore.\n\nSuddenly, you spy a wise-looking owl, and you ask it a question.\n\nSTEELERS FAN: Oh wise owl, what should I do? My Steelers are 0-2. And now Ben Roethlisberger is out for the season with an elbow injury that requires surgery. I don\u2019t even know the name of our backup quarterback.\n\nWISE OWL: It\u2019s Mason Rudolph, silly.\n\nSTEELERS FAN: That sounds like the name of a wholesale furniture store. \u201cHey, I got my couch at Mason Rudolph!\u201d\n\nWISE-LOOKING OWL: Come on. Rudolph might surprise you. He was quite good at Oklahoma State.\n\nSTEELERS FAN: I may just build myself a bed of leaves here on the forest floor, and cry myself to sleep until April.\n\nWISE-LOOKING OWL: Like a Dolphins fan? I wouldn\u2019t do that. Look at the AFC North, buddy. The Bengals are a joke. The Browns are mortal. The Ravens should return to earth. Come back and talk to me in November.\n\nOK, it\u2019s that time of the year again. It\u2019s time for an alliterative Premature Panic Party.\n\nMason Rudolph will take over at quarterback for the Steelers.

The Steelers are oh-fer-2, as are the Dolphins, the Broncos, the Bengals, the Giants, the Panthers, the Jaguars, and Dan Snyder\u2019s Washington Sadness Machine\u2014and whoever loses Monday night\u2019s Styrofoam sword fight between the 0-1 Jets and the 0-1 Browns.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of one of these franchises, is it time to find an alternative hobby? Should you trade in another season of miserable Sundays to develop a healthier habit, like smoking unfiltered cigarettes?\n\nAbandonment is anathema to grizzly football culture, of course. Could you look Mike Ditka in the eye and tell him you\u2019re quitting watching football?\n\nThen again: Has Mike Ditka watched the 2019 Dolphins?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s more productive to try something else. What if you learned the Art of French Cooking? Get the cookbooks, watch Jacques Pepin videos, the whole deal. Instead of screaming at the television, you learn to make a classic beef bourguignon, and invite all your friends over on Sunday afternoon to eat it. If your friends are busy, you could simply eat an entire beef bourguignon by yourself, alone in the dark. Still more fun than watching the Bengals!\n\nWhat if you learned Esperanto?\n\nOr to play the oboe?\n\nWhat if you made a life-size butter sculpture of Brent Musburger? And gave it to Brent Musburger? I bet he\u2019d love it.\n\nWhat if you simply went down to the park on Sunday afternoons and covered yourself with birdseed, and let the park birds settle atop your body and nibble?\n\nYou mean to tell me that\u2019s a less satisfying way of spending the day than watching the Dolphins?\n\nDolphins players during a 43-0 loss to the Patriots. Miami fell to 0-2. Photo: Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press\n\nI know: I should stop being a pessimist. It\u2019s entirely possible a miserable club will turn it around. The 1993 Dallas Cowboys, 2001 New England Patriots and 2007 New York Giants all won the Super Bowl after beginning the season with an 0-2 record.\n\nTurnarounds happen. I am not sure it\u2019s quite the time for Steelers fans to flee, even with Big Ben out. Jacksonville should be better, but lost its starting quarterback, Nick Foles, replacing him with lovable backup named Gardner Minshew, who looks like a rogue detective in a \u201870s cop drama. The Jags gave Houston trouble on Sunday. Maybe they\u2019ll climb out.\n\nBut Dolphins fans should flee. I\u2019m not sure even the Dolphins\u2014who have been outscored 102-10 in two games, and are widely viewed to be tanking in order to land a high pick\u2014want to watch the Dolphins.\n\nI am starting to wonder if dolphins\u2014the species\u2014are worried about reputational damage to their brand. Does that happen? Do other marine animals mock dolphins about the Dolphins? Are dolphins taking a lot of grief from sea horses and anemones? I bet that would get old fast. Anemones are merciless cranks.\n\nAll of this is a mere suggestion. If you are a fan of one of the 0-2 outfits and want to stay the course, you have my condolences and my strangely fascinated admiration.\n\nDenver dropped to 0-2 with a loss to the Bears.

The Saints will have to play without Drew Brees, who hurt his hand on Sunday, and the referees continue to conspire against them. The Vikings had a fetid loss to Green Bay to drop to 1-1. The 2-0 New England Patriots are accumulating public ire as they wait out an NFL investigation into sexual assault charges against Antonio Brown.\n\nMeanwhile, the Detroit Lions are undefeated at 1-0-1, which is a bizarre sentence to type. The Buffalo Bills are 2-0, which I thought was illegal.\n\nThe point is that football isn\u2019t life. It may be the most popular entertainment product in America\u2014the last true shared experience we have, other than yelling at each other on Twitter\u2014but it doesn\u2019t have to rule your existence.\n\nIf you\u2019re 0-2, consider your options. Make that beef bourguignon. Feed those pigeons. Start playing Sunday golf.\n\nJust don\u2019t blame me when the golf feels worse than 0-2.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Your favorite NFL team is 0-2.
