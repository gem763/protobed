Picture: Gary Ramage\n\nThe other pillars of change the coalition of media outlets want is the right to contest the application for warrants for journalists and media organisations, for journalists to be exempt from national security laws that affectively threaten them with jail for doing their job, a new regime that limits which documents can be stamped \u201csecret\u201d, a properly functioning Freedom of Information regime that currently allows governments to shut down reporting and reform to defamation laws that have effectively been weaponised to stop reporting of public interest issues.\n\nOur national obsession with national security has seen 75 pieces of related bipartisan-backed legislation pass parliament since the 9/11 terror attacks but there is growing evidence their use is being broadened to keep secrets unrelated to national security.\n\nAt a parliamentary inquiry, the now former AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin said in the last five years there had been 75 referrals of potential unauthorised disclosures of information and only two raids, including on the home of a journalist from News Corp Australia and the ABC Sydney headquarters. Media organisations believe that is two is too many.\n\n\u201cThe raids on Annika Smethurst and the ABC are the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d News Corp Australasia executive chairman Michael Miller said.\n\nmedia_camera Michael Miller, Executive Chairman of News Corp Australasia.\n\n\u201cWe have been warning about the culture of secrecy and laws that wrongly criminalise journalism for a decade.\u201d\n\nNews Corp policy executive Campbell Reid said no professional media outlet would knowingly endanger lives with disclosures and governments, police and military forces often take the media into their confidence.\n\n\u201cBut on the other hand the same people keep drafting new laws with the power to lock up the very people that they are prepared to trust when it suits them,\u201d he said.\n\nYour Right To Know Campaign All of us should be suspicious when the government is introducing laws that mean we don't know what's going on.\n\nOriginally published as Six reforms Australia needs right now", "description": "Media outlets across the country have joined forces to demand six key legal changes needed now so Australians can find out about the issues that directly affect their lives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7a4c891356579355ca51f9cf9c1f2df5", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
