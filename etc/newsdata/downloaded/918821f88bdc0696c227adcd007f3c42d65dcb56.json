This was on top of the land being purchased for \u00a3200,000.\n\nIn a stark lesson for any self-builders who underestimate expenses and the things that can go wrong, the family's project nearly collapsed, with costs mounting and money running out.\n\nThe project delivered a three-bedroom home at a cost of \u00a3370,000, which included buying the land and building the house\n\nBut equally as inspiration for those building their own home who do find themselves in an awkward position, the Wilsons pulled it back.\n\nTo get the project back on track, the couple ended up selling off some of the original parcel of land they bought for \u00a3100,000. Their final build costs came in at \u00a3270,000, delivering a three-bed home in the countryside for \u00a3370,000 in total.\n\nThe key to the final success was getting by with a little help from their friend.\n\nJess Barker, an architect and childhood friend of Steph's, stepped in at the eleventh hour with a new design that included affordable black corrugated sheets on the outside and even a climbing wall for one of the children's bedrooms inside.\n\nMailOnline Property was given an exclusive interview with owner Steph about how the project would not have survived without her childhood friend.\n\nChildhood friend and architect Jessica (pictured left) talks though the design with Steph\n\nSteph and Alex's original plans for a luxury home on the 27 acres of land that they had bought proved over ambitious when costs mounted and he lost his job.\n\nAlthough they had sold their existing home to help raise funds for the build and were living in a caravan on site to save on bills, their project struggled to get off the ground.\n\nSo, how did they deal with the scenario where a self build was going wrong?\n\nAfter the original plans were ditched due to cost, the family got help when Steph's friend Jessica stepped in, as she is now an architect in London at Stolon Studio.\n\nTwo years later than expected, work began on a new design that rescued their dream of a home.\n\nSteph said: 'Jessica has been such a good friend and it was great to work with her. She totally saved the project.\n\n'We had reached a point where the other design was dead in the water and we didn't know where to go as we didn't have the money.'\n\nSteph added: 'Jessica suggested a different design and guided us through it. We paid her, but at a discounted rate and we are very grateful as she put so much time and work into it - and she did that out of friendship.\n\n'Her ideas have been amazing, using budget materials that look designer.'\n\nIn the programme, which first aired last night on Channel 4 and is now available on demand, Kevin commented: 'This project may have been inspired by family but its design and execution has grown out of friendship.'\n\nSteph and Alex Wilson built a three-bedroom house in Herefordshire on her Grandfather's land where she played as a child\n\nA childhood friend - who is now an architect - stepped in at the eleventh hour with a new design that included a climbing wall for one of the children's bedrooms\n\nJessica points out that she remembers playing as a child on the land with Steph, describing the project as an honour.\n\nJessica said: 'Anyone watching anyone they know go through this, it was just desperate times.\n\nAny self builder who has to abandon their original design will obviously be disappointed, but if a new one can get a home built then it is worth considering.\n\nIn Steph and Alex's case, they are delighted with their new home, even though it is not the one they initially imagined.\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline Property, Steph said: 'It is way better than we thought. What we have ended up with is a style that we really like.\n\n'We always wanted a barn version and thought we would go for a traditional wood version but Jessica persuaded us otherwise and we are really pleased with the result.\n\n'The balcony makes it really special and it enjoys the sun all day.'\n\nExtra touches: Kevin stretches over the glass balustrade on the bedroom balcony\n\nChildhood friend - and now architect in London at Stolon Studio - Jessica Barker was responsible for the final project\n\nThe home cost \u00a3270,000 to build and after clearing half the \u00a3200,000 land cost by selling some of it off, the final bill was \u00a3370,000.\n\nHowever, Steph says that the property is on an acre, which only eats up about \u00a38,000 of the value of the remaining land. Take that remaining land value into account and in theory the cost of building their own home drops to \u00a3278,000.\n\nThe good news was that although they had to swap out their original design for a cheaper one to build, there was some money left in the pot at the end to add extra touches.\n\n'We saved money by being in the caravan so long without a mortgage and bills that we spent a little extra at the end on items we had not planned to such as the balustrade on the balcony,' says Steph.\n\n'We had planned a wooden one to save money but decided to go with the glass one.'\n\nJessica's design also included a climbing wall in one of the child's bedrooms and the floor, fixtures and fittings in the bathroom.\n\nAnd when asked about what Kevin could expect to see when he returns to visit them in a few years, Steph said: 'The whole aim was to live on the farm. A sense of being here. It will be a bit more cluttered and less minimalistic but on the whole it will not be much different as it is everything we hoped for.'\n\nAlthough she added: 'We hope that the wild flower bed on the terrace surrounding the house grows.'\n\nIf you missed Steph\u2019s episode of Grand Designs, catch up on Sunday at 5.30pm on Channel 4 or on demand via All 4", "description": "Steph Wilson, who appeared in Grand Designs this week, tells MailOnline Property how although it wasn't the original plan, her self build is 'way better than we thought'.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/11/08/4944874-0-image-a-2_1539243594112.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-11"}
