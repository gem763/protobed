But watch out for scammers looking to put one over you on classified car sites.\n\nREAD | The thrill of the first-time car buying journey\n\nHere are some red flags that should get your attention:\n\n1. Documentation\n\nWhile it's understandable that you can lose your registration documents for your car, it's relatively cheap to have duplicated printed.\n\n\n\nSo beware of ads where the seller advertises that there are 'no papers for the car' or the 'papers are with the previous owner'.\n\nWhile not illegal, this usually indicates that someone is looking to make a quick buck by offloading a dodgy vehicle, leaving you saddled with a long-term headache when you try to register the car in your name. Walk away.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Engine\n\nAs a rule, I would steer clear of cars where the seller advertises that the engine has been customised for performance.\n\nImage: iStock\n\nThink about it, if the engine has been customised to perform better, why is the car being sold? Also, backyard performance upgrades usually do not include braking and tyre upgrades to match the engine performance.\n\nREAD | Avoid these mistakes when buying a new car\n\nDon't be suckered into paying for someone else's vanity project of which they\u2019ve grown tired. Thank you, next.\n\n3. Problems\n\nIf I had a 10c for every time I saw an ad where the car had a \"small problem\" or \"requires some TLC\" I would be rich enough to buy an Italian sports car.\n\nImage: iStock\n\nOnce, when going to see an Audi A4 with a \"small problem\", it turned out that the Audi had been in a smash and someone had done a DIY repair. The light and wiper switches didn't work properly, and the driver's side window would only go down and not come up again.\n\nOther problems you can spot in an ad include \"small electrical problem\" or \"battery required\" - this is usually code for: \"There's no way you will be able to drive this car home.\"\n\n4. Car body\n\nLook carefully at the pictures in the ad.\n\nCars with smashes - especially around the suspension are bad news as this is an indication of a pricey fix. I've seen homemade alignment jobs where cars crab-crawl down the road. This is why I have the owner drive his or her own car first. Look for rust on the pics in car ads - especially around the windows, doors and pillars.\n\nImage: iStock\n\nOn the side view, check that the panel gaps look consistent and if are not, don't bother calling because it's likely an indication of bigger (and more expensive) problems lurking below the surface.\n\nSome sellers take horrible pictures of the cars: Photos taken into the sun, out of focus, night-time, or obscured images may be accidental - or a deliberate way to obscure the worst bits of a car. Once, when looking to buy a Toyota, the picture in no way matched the disaster of the actual car.\n\nBut the picture was only of the interior which wasn't bad, but the car was a wreck and should have gone straight to scrap. It wasn't going right.\n\n5. Areas of sale\n\nWithout any discrimination, there are some areas you shouldn't go to buy a car because it would certainly place you at risk \u2013 even more so if you plan on carrying cash with you. Most genuine sellers will agree to meet in a public or neutral venue to conduct the sale and if they point blank refuse (within reason) it is perhaps better to walk away from that buy.\n\nImage: iStock\n\nAlso, it is better to conduct deals during the day when you can see everything clearly - including the seller's details.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, when you look at an ad and see a great car, in wonderful condition, and the cheapest price ever - be aware that it might just be a scam. People don't generally sell perfect cars at rock bottom prices - even if they are \"emigrating\" or \"leaving the province urgently\".\n\n\n\nKeep your wits about you.", "description": "'It's easy to shop for your next ride within close proximity of your home so going to view a car is an easy win.
