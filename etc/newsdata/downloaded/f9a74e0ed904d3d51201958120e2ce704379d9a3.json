Charles Richard, the nominee to be commander of U.S. Strategic Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee he would give the president his \u201cbest military advice\u201d on the New START and Open Skies treaties, and listed several pros and cons with each.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut he would not definitively say at his confirmation hearing whether he supports staying in the treaties or withdrawing despite several senators\u2019 attempts to get him to do so.\n\n\u201cI will support any arms control or other treaty that enhances the security of this nation,\u201d Richard said generally when asked about both treaties.\n\nNew START, negotiated by the Obama administration, caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads the United States and Russia can have at 1,550 each.\n\nNew START is up for renewal in 2021. The Trump administration has indicated it wants to expand the scope of the treaty as a condition of extension, by taking steps such as folding in China and other weapons not currently covered by the agreement.\n\nSupporters of New START say the Trump administration\u2019s conditions are poison pills meant to kill the treaty.\n\nThe Open Skies Treaty, meanwhile, allows the pact\u2019s 34 signatories to fly unarmed observation flights over the entire territory of other signatories. The intention is to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.\n\nThe United States has also used treaty in recent years to show support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, flying observation flights in 2018 after Russia seized Ukrainian naval ships and in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea.\n\nBut Republicans for years have accused Russia of violating the treaty by blocking flights over some of its territory, including Kaliningrad and areas near its border with the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\nDemocrats first raised the alarm earlier this month that the administration was considering withdrawing from Open Skies, writing a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room Iraqi defense minister: US troops leaving in four weeks Trump announces he's lifting sanctions on Turkey MORE and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoTrump's new challenge is officials dishing dirt Tehran's tyrants have been provoked Senators ask State Department to expedite visa for Kurdish commander should he visit US MORE that said they \u201cunderstand\u201d a withdrawal in under consideration.\n\nOn Thursday, Sen.

Everyone agrees it would be best if we brought Russia back into compliance. Everyone agrees it would be great if everyone had a pony, as well. But we\u2019ve spent years trying to get Russia into compliance with this treaty, and in the meantime, Russia has continued to gain significant intelligence advantage over the United States.\u201d\n\nRichard told Cotton his analysis of Russia\u2019s violations was \u201cquite correct,\u201d but would not commit one way or the other on the treaty.\n\n\u201cYou are hitting at the factors that have to be considered on whether or not we stay in the treaty,\u201d Richard told Cotton.\n\nAsked later by Sen.

It provides valuable insight and partnership opportunities with our allies. But it does require us to make the capital and resource investments to fully use the provisions inside that treaty, and it does come at a counterintelligence cost the United States.\n\nOn New START, Duckworth and committee ranking member Sen. Jack Reed John (Jack) Francis ReedErdo\u011fan got the best of Trump, experts warn Senators fear Syria damage 'irreversible' after Esper, Milley briefing This week: Congress returns to chaotic Washington MORE (D-R.I.) pressed Richard on the benefits of the agreement.\n\nRichard said New START has provided \u201cvaluable insight\u201d on the makeup of Russia\u2019s strategic forces, but raised concern that the treaty does not cover some types of weapons and appeared to allude to China not being a party to the treaty.\n\n\u201cThe New START treaty has provided us with valuable insight into Russian, in this case, capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives us a feel for their size, capacity, capability, but it also doesn't address large categories of weapons that are not treaty constrained. It is only with Russia, and they are developing new systems. And I would provide my best military advice, if confirmed, into the pros and cons of any future agreement, including this one.\u201d", "description": "The admiral nominated to lead the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pentagon_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
