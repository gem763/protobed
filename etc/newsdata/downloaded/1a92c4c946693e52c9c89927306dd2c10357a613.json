A progression image of Andrew with glasses (right)\n\nAndrew skipped school in his hometown of Doncaster and left on a train to London. His father describes Andrew as having an 'unusual' right ear, deaf in his left ear, highly intelligent and speaking quickly and quietly, without a strong accent\n\nIn the 'Help us to find Andrew' blog created by Andrew's father Kevin Gosden, specific details of the missing 26-year-old could help solve the mystery of his disappearance.\n\nHe describes Andrew as having an 'unusual' right ear, deaf in his left ear, highly intelligent and speaking quickly and quietly, without a strong accent.\n\nWhen Andrew went missing, his vision was very poor and he needed strong lenses but the new picture shows him without glasses as he may now be using contact lenses.\n\nThere is also CCTV footage showing Andrew's walking gait which is shown to be a quick pace.\n\nDetective Inspector Andy Knowles, who has been overseeing the police investigation into Andrew's disappearance since 2017, said: 'While this latest photograph may not seem to show much change, someone's face can look drastically different without glasses and therefore it's important that we share this photograph in case it helps jog someone's memory.\n\n'Andrew has now been missing for 12 years and his family are understandably desperate for any answers that may help them understand what happened to their loved one.\n\n'Sharing specific features of Andrew's appearance and character is intended to help the public and reduce the number of generalised sightings we receive.\n\n'We want you to study Kevin's blog closely and think hard about anyone in your lives who may have one or more of these traits.\n\nCCTV which features on the blog to find Andrew shows his walking gait which appears to be quite quick. The footage was captured of the 14-year-old on the day of his disappearance September 14 2007\n\nKevin Gosden, from Doncaster, lost everything when his son Andrew went missing in 2007. Kevin says he would rather know that his son was dead than to be stuck in 'limbo'\n\n'Anyone in your life who has an incomplete life history, anyone who might not have easy access to a bank account or a passport possibly, with the distinctive right ear markings that we know Andrew had - we'd be really keen to speak to those people.'\n\nMr Knowles added: 'Andrew, know that you can contact us completely confidentially - let us know you are safe so we can reassure your family that you have come to no harm.'\n\nMore information about Andrew can be found on Mr Gosden's blog.\n\nAnyone who believes they have information about Andrew is asked to contact South Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 161 of 13 September 2017, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.", "description": "Andrew Gosden, now 26, disappeared from the Balby area of Doncaster in September 2007 aged 14.
