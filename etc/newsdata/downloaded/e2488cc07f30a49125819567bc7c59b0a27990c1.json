He just brought us back down to earth, and told us, \u2018You have to play well first, and everything else will come\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see it come together. It will mean a lot for us to go all the way as a team.\u201d\n\nFlanker Francois Louw added: \u201cHe had a challenge\u2026 to align the players on a specific plan.\n\n\u201cSo far so good, we\u2019ll see on Saturday whether it\u2019s worked.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Rassie Erasmus has led South Africa from the depths of despair to the Rugby World Cup final, his coaching ethos built around handing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/96fb8c_erasmus-has-bonded-springboks-depths-despair-world-cup-final-springbok-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
