It is too late.\u2019\n\nDuncan Lawrence, 60, repeatedly refused to answer questions about a new regime he ushered in at Lancaster Lodge in Richmond, south-west London (Picture: PA)\n\nMr Bennett believes that \u2018pivotal input\u2019 from Lawrence, led to a major change in how the care home was run.\n\nHe said: \u2018It has been a constant and exhausting struggle to try and ensure that all the processes, investigations and inquiries are properly conducted and completed.\n\n\u2018The inquest should have finally revealed the full truth to us about Sophie\u2019s avoidable death.\n\n\u2018Duncan Lawrence\u2019s behaviour denied us this.\u2019\n\nThe court heard how the teenager, from Tooting in south-west London, was bipolar and had atypical autism and social anxiety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was found hanged in a bathroom on May 2, 2016 and died two days later in Kingston Hospital as a result of her injuries, a post-mortem examination found.\n\nAn inquest jury in February this year found she did not intend to take her own life, the court was told.\n\nNickie and Ben Bennett, the parents of Sophie Bennett (Picture: PA)\n\nJurors also found that the changes to care, inadequately trained staff and the fact that staff were \u2018in the deep end\u2019 and \u2018learning on the job\u2019, all contributed to Ms Bennett\u2019s death.\n\nThe jury said that a \u2018grossly inadequate\u2019 observation plan was put in place for Ms Bennett, and not understood or followed.\n\nShortly before her death, regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) criticised the facility as inadequate in a number of areas \u2013 six months after it had been rated good by the same body.\n\nLawrence, who was no longer working at the care home at the time of Ms Bennett\u2019s death, initially said he could not attend the three-week inquest in person as he was caring for his sick mother in Alaska.\n\nNicky Morgan stands down as an MP\n\nBut he failed to appear before the coroner on video-link amid claims he was actually in south London \u2013 not the US \u2013 at the time, later stating his no-show was down to \u2018ongoing stress\u2019 in his \u2018personal life\u2019.\n\nIt also emerged during the inquest that Mr Lawrence did not have a legitimate medical doctorate while in his role as a consultant, and had instead obtained a certificate from a \u2018degree mill\u2019 in Denmark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sentencing on Wednesday comes as the CQC attempts to bring a separate legal action against the Richmond Psychosocial International Foundation (RPFI) and manager Peggy Jhugroo, who was a senior figure at Lancaster Lodge at the time of Ms Bennett\u2019s death.\n\nNeed support?
