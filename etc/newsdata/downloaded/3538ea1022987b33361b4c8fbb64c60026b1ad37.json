However, the three seats of the CDS-PP should be enough to form a coalition with the PSD, if the two center-right parties can overcome a history of rancor on the island.\n\n\u201cIf what happened in Madeira today is repeated on the mainland, that would suit me just fine,\u201d chuckled the PSD\u2019s national leader Rui Rio as the result was confirmed.\n\nThat looks unlikely.\n\nLatest polls have Costa\u2019s Socialists winning close to 40 percent of the vote in the October 6 national ballot, compared to around 25 percent for the PSD.\n\nUnless there\u2019s a major turnaround, Europe\u2019s most successful Socialist looks sure to again buck the trend of declining center-left fortunes elsewhere on the continent.\n\nPORTUGAL NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nVoters are pleased with how Costa and Finance Minister M\u00e1rio Centeno have managed the past four years of economic recovery. They still blame the center right for austerity measures introduced in return for a \u20ac78 billion bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund that kept finances afloat after the country was clobbered by the eurozone debt crisis.\n\nThe only real electoral suspense is whether Costa can secure an absolute majority or be obliged to continue his geringon\u00e7a (contraption) alliance with two smaller, far-left parties.\n\nBoth his partners fared badly in Madeira. The Left Bloc lost its two seats in the regional assembly and the Portuguese Communist Party kept just one after seeing its vote drop from 5.5 percent to 1.8 percent.\n\nNationwide, however, the leftists' vote seems to be holding up better. The Left Bloc is polling around 10 percent and the PCP close to 7 percent. Both have warned that giving the Socialists an absolute majority will hand Costa excessive power and tempt the PS to lurch further to the center, away from \u201cprogressive\u201d policies.\n\nWith Portuguese voters continuing to reject right-wing populism (two hard-right parties running in Madeira scored a combined total of 0.61 percent), the main insurgent party is the animal rights outfit People Animals and Nature (PAN).\n\nIt failed to make a breakthrough in Madeira but got its first MEP in May\u2019s European Parliament election and is polling over 4 percent nationwide with a program that includes creating a \u201csort of national health service\" for pets, a ban on bullfighting and setting up a network of \u201cpet-friendly\u201d beaches.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll wipe out our economy, wipe out investment and everybody will be forced to live like beggars like in Venezuela\u201d \u2014 Miguel Albuquerque, outgoing presidentof Madeira\n\nDespite such ideas, debates have been rather tepid.\n\nA Costa vs. Rio face-off carried live during primetime on all three main national TV networks last week focused on technical points of tax policy and healthcare spending. It was completely lacking in the personal attacks and populist fireworks that have become familiar in much of Europe.\n\nThey notably agreed to make the fight against climate change a cross-party national priority. \u201cWe all have to be together on this, right and left,\u201d Rio said. \u201cIt\u2019s too serious to be the PSD against the PS, I even agree with the Left Bloc\u2019s slogan: there is no planet B.\u201d\n\nThe Madeira campaign, in contrast, was a no-holds-barred affair as the right struggled to defend its stronghold on the sub-tropical vacation island.\n\nLying in the Atlantic, some 500 kilometers off the coast of northwest Africa and 1,000 kilometers southwest of mainland Portugal, the autonomous region consists of Madeira island, its much smaller neighbor Porto Santo and a scattering of uninhabited rocks. It has enjoyed a wide degree of self-rule since the 1970s. Portugal\u2019s other Atlantic archipelago, the Azores, have a similar status.\n\nPSD leaders on the island warned a victory for the left would lead to communist-style economic ruin and unrest.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll wipe out our economy, wipe out investment and everybody will be forced to live like beggars like in Venezuela,\u201d Miguel Albuquerque, the outgoing regional president, cautioned in a final rally. \u201cIf they want Venezuela, they should go and live there.\u201d\n\nThat message resonated with a significant section of the population.\n\nTens of thousands of Madeiran islanders emigrated to Venezuela during the country\u2019s mid-20th century oil boom. Recently, their descendants have been flocking back to escape the economic ruin and political chaos under the left-wing regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\n\u201cSocialism and communism aren\u2019t exactly the most popular words in our dictionary,\u201d Ana Cristina Monteiro, president of the Venezuelan Immigrant Community Association, told the SAPO24 news site last week. She was elected on the CDS-PP list.\n\nVenezuelan-Portuguese voters accounted for around 5,000 of the 258,000 registered voters in the Madeira election and the PSD\u2019s margin of victory over the Socialists was just over 5,200 votes.", "description": "Polls show Socialists on course for four more years.", "authors": ["Paul Ames", "Stephen Brown", "Ivo Oliveira"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55392676-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
