Cole never let the Rays up for air, giving up just two hits and striking out 10 in eight innings, throwing 99-mph in his final pitch.\n\nNow, America gets what they wanted all along.\n\nThe New York Yankees and Astros in the ALCS.\n\nA heavyweight fight between two powerhouses that combined for 210 victories during the regular season, and six more in the postseason.\n\nRound 1 will be Saturday night at 8:08 ET at Minute Maid Park, and the winner of this best-of-seven series will be the overwhelming favorite to win the World Series.\n\nGerrit Cole reacts after an inning-ending double play in the seventh inning. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt\u2019s a rematch of the 2017 ALCS when the Yankees led 3 games to 2, only for the Astros to win the next two games in Houston, eliminating New York.\n\nThe Astros went onto to win the World Series in seven games over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe Yankees went onto fire their manager, Joe Girardi, who was in broadcast booth Thursday night.\n\nNow, with a new manager, Aaron Boone, and a team that hit 306 home runs, just one shy of the major-league record, the Yankees are back again.\n\nThe Astros, if nothing else, showed their vulnerability.\n\nCome on, if the Rays can take the Astros to five games, and beat likely Cy Young winner Justin Verlander and former Cy Young winner Zack Greinke, what in the world can the powerful Yankees do to them?\n\nWell, we\u2019re about to find out.\n\nThe Yankees, if nothing else, now don\u2019t have to face Cole until Game 3, who also is lined up for Game 6. Verlander is scheduled to go Game 2 and Game 6. Greinke will go Game 1 and likely Game 5.\n\nThe Yankees will have a fully rested bullpen with starters Masahiro Tanaka and Luis Severino ready to go Games 1-2, and could activate injured lefty CC Sabathia and center fielder Aaron Hicks for the series.\n\nNo matter.\n\nThe Astros aren\u2019t scared.\n\nThey are oozing with confidence, and plan to use the Yankees simply as a reference on their resume to the title of one of the greatest teams ever assembled.\n\n\u201cI think this is the best team we\u2019ve had here,\u2019\u2019 MVP finalist Alex Bregman told USA TODAY Sports, \u201cby far. If win the World Series this year, I think we have a chance to be one of the best teams of all time.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet, to be considered among the greatest teams of all time, the Astros need another World Series championship -- their second in three years -- to go along with their three consecutive 100-victory seasons.\n\nThat will be the only way they\u2019ll be forever remembered.\n\nThe Yankees vs. the Astros.\n\nIt\u2019s finally here.\n\nFIRED: With Kapler out, who's up next for Phillies?\n\nSTUNNER: Kershaw takes blame: 'I may not get over it'\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Houston beat Tampa Bay in Game 5 of the ALDS to give what America wants  most-- a Yankees-Astros matchup in the ALCS.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
