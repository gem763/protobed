It has improved from No. 17 in 2017 and No. 15 last year.\n\nKorea ranked in the top tier in such categories as ICT adoption and macroeconomic stability, but slid in labor market evaluations such as hiring and firing practices and cooperation in labor-employer relations.\n\nThe WEF ranks the global competitiveness of countries based on 12 \"pillars\" which are organized into four \"overarching components.\" Korea also received high marks for infrastructure (No. 6), health (No.8) and innovation capability (No. 6).\n\nAccording to the report, Korea's weaknesses are its product market (59th), labor market (51st) and institutions (26th). In the product market pillar, the most dismal performances were extent of market dominance (93rd) and trade tariffs (91st).\n\nEven worse in the labor market pillar were redundancy costs (116th), hiring and firing practices (102nd), cooperation in labor-employer relations (130th) and ease of hiring foreign labor (100th).\n\nAs for institutions, the WEF gave the country low marks for burden of government regulation (87th), government ensuring policy stability (76th), social capital (72nd) and, perhaps surprisingly, judicial independence (69th).\n\nSingapore topped the overall ranking, up from second last year, still followed by the U.S. Next were Hong Kong and the Netherlands.
