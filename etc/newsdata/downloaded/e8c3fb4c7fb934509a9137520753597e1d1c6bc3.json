Having seen many great lit fest events, a shame this was so poor.'\n\nOne audience member said: 'Odd moves on Roth's part included asking questions such as, 'From the Switzerland tour...was there anything that happened that you maybe don't remember, or anything that you're only remembering now?', prompting a blank look from his interviewees.'\n\nRoth has also been accused of speaking more than his interviewees and dropping in 'groan-inducing' jokes.\n\nFans have now taken to social media to share their scathing reviews, prompting sarcastic responses from Roth including, 'thanks for coming on the tour bus.'\n\nDebbie Harry, 74, and Chris Stein, 69, of Blondie appeared at the event to promote her memoir 'Face It'\n\nAudience members have hit out at the host Rob Roth (not pictured), accusing him of 'terrible, disjointed questioning' and being the 'worst interviewer ever'\n\nRoth also told audience members: 'We don't want to hear your life story - think about a really good question and make it count!'\n\nAnother tweeted: 'Debbie Harry interview was appalling. The interviewer was possibly the worst I've ever seen. So many people left.'\n\nRoth's style of interviewing seemed to reign as the main criticism, with one festival-goer tweeting: 'Amazing to see Debbie Harry but boy, was it poorly done. Terrible, disjointed questioning. Such a shame.'\n\nSteve Kemsley said: 'Fantastic festival but what the hell was that Debbie Harry debacle? Walked out with loads of others! Worst ever. Disgrace!!!\n\nFollowing the talk Harry and Stein signed books and took pictures with fans.\n\nThe Festival organisers have been approached for a comment.", "description": "The Blondie singer, 74, appeared at the Cheltenham Literature Festival to promote her new biography 'Face It' but fans were left disappointed by her interview with Rob director Roth.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/13/19691242-0-image-a-35_1571055059762.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
