He also admitted to kissing \u201cplenty of girls who have turned their heads before\u201d.\n\nIn a statement shared this morning, Wellington denounced Glasgow\u2019s behaviour.\n\n\u201cWith his appearance on the reality TV show The Bachelorette, Councillor Jess Glasgow has revealed behaviour that is totally inappropriate for a Noosa councillor, indeed for any individual.\n\n\u201cThe behaviour displayed was misogynistic, crude, and highly offensive.\u201d\n\nGO OFF, TONY.\n\n\u201cWhether or not Mr Glasgow was simply performing for the cameras, he showed incredibly poor judgement in allowing himself to be filmed lying, being extremely and consistently disrespectful of women, and outright offensive.\u201d\n\nWellington was also not amused by Glasgow\u2019s constant references to Noosa, which has unfortunately copped a lot of flack on the socials.\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s premiere episode, Wellington confirmed he would refer Glasgow to the Office of the Independent Assessor \u201cas a result of his behaviour bringing the Council and community into disrepute\u201d.\n\nWellington binned Glasgow\u2019s claims that he sought his approval before hopping on the show. Also, Glasgow has apparently fibbed to the media about \u201csupposed accrued leave and pay entitlements.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving now viewed last night\u2019s second episode of the program, I have spoken to Cr Glasgow and told him to seriously consider resigning from his position as Councillor on the Noosa Council.\n\n\u201cWhilst I do not have the legal authority to remove a sitting councillor, he has arguably brought the Council into disrepute and undermined the good reputation of our Shire.\n\n\u201cPut simply, there is absolutely no room for vile misogyny and loutish behaviour in Noosa or in Noosa Council.\u201d\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY!", "description": "Noosa Mayor\u00a0Tony Wellington\u00a0has called for the resignation of Councillor Jess Glasgow,\u00a0after his frankly repulsive behaviour on\u00a0The Bachelorette.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/f3390297aed9a0c1edb0bde0409dff6c-748678.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
