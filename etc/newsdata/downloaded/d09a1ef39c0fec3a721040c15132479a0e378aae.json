She hates the country,\u201d he said.\n\nTurning his attention to next year\u2019s election, Trump said he was convinced he would win in 2020, no matter what.\n\n\u201cLooks like Bernie lost his chance, huh?\u201d Trump said, in apparent reference to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a 2020 Democratic contender who suffered a recent heart attack.\n\nTrump\u2019s Louisiana rally comes after he barnstormed a gathering in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Thursday, vowing a \u201cbacklash\u201d against Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed, they want to erase your voice and they want to erase your future, but they will fail because in America, the people rule again.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2020 this will \u201cproduce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018False claims\u2019 \u2013\n\nBack in Washington, former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was fired by Trump, testified before three House committees on Friday, despite White House attempts to stop witnesses from appearing before congressional investigators.\n\nShe told legislators that she was forced from her job as a result of \u201cfalse claims,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nThere was possibly worrying news for Trump as troubles mounted for his colorful, but controversial personal attorney Rudy Giuliani \u2014 a central figure in the administration\u2019s murky contacts with Ukraine.\n\nCongressional investigators see Giuliani as Trump\u2019s point man in a campaign to extract dirt on Biden from the Ukrainians. On Wednesday, two of the lawyer\u2019s clients were arrested in a campaign finance violation case involving foreign money.\n\nAsked Friday if Giuliani continued to be his lawyer, Trump gave a less than convincing answer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good attorney and he has been my attorney.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s previous personal attorney Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years prison in 2018.\n\n\u2013 Respite from DC troubles \u2013\n\nDemocrats who have accused Trump of abusing his office throughout his first term believe they have finally cornered the president with the impeachment probe.\n\nTrump was shown in the rough transcript of a phone call summary issued by the White House to have pressed new Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky to open a corruption probe of Biden and his son.\n\nThe president has pushed back, refusing to allow anyone in his administration to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPublic support for impeachment, though, is increasing. A poll from Fox News \u2014 a channel favored by US conservatives \u2014 shows 51 percent back his removal from office.\n\nWith control of the lower house of Congress, Democrats are likely to vote to impeach in the coming months, even if few believe the Republican-led Senate will actually convict Trump and force him from power.\n\nTrump has however faced a rare party rebellion this week over his abrupt decision to remove US troops from the Turkish-Syrian border, effectively abandoning Kurds who had fought alongside the United States in Syria to a Turkish assault.", "description": "Lake Charles (United States) (AFP) \u2013 As impeachment pressure mounted on Donald Trump, the president left Washington for the second day in a row", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/48a28d_framing-as-victim-democratic-fake-news-plot-trump-galvanized-supporters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
