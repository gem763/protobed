It sparked massive protests that have become increasingly violent and caused the airport to shut down earlier this month.\n\nBut Lam said in a pre-recorded television message on Wednesday that the government would not accept other demands, including an independent inquiry into alleged police misconduct against protesters. However, she named two new members to a police watchdog agency investigating the matter.\n\nProtesters have also called for the release of those detained without charges, but Lam said this was unacceptable.\n\nThe Hang Seng HSI, +0.26% surged 3.9% on Wednesday, the best gain since November, ahead of the formal announcement.\n\nIn Europe SXXP, -0.08% , stocks exposed to China and Hong Kong in particular rallied, including HSBC Holdings HSBA, +0.45% .

Authorities in turn have employed water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and batons. More than 1,100 people have been detained.\n\nThe mostly young protesters say that a degree of violence is necessary to get the government\u2019s attention after peaceful rallies were futile. Lam\u2019s administration says the violence must end before any dialogue can begin.\n\nIn Beijing, the mainland office responsible for Hong Kong slammed the escalating violence and warned that China will \u201cnot sit idly by\u201d if the situation worsens.\n\nThe prolonged protests have hurt Hong Kong\u2019s economy amid a slowdown in the Chinese economy and its trade war with the United States.\n\n\u2014 The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced the withdrawal of the extradition bill that has sparked the nearly three-month old protests, a move that triggered...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ629_lam_09_ZG_20190904071515.jpg"}
