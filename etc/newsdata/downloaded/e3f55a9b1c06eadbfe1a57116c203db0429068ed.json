The Nazi death camp is located near Danzig - which is now the Polish city of Gdansk\n\nHe said he heard screams and banging shortly after, but added: 'I didn't know that they were being gassed.'\n\nDey said that about 20 or 30 prisoners were led in, and that they didn't resist. He said he couldn't say whether they were men or women, because their heads were shaved, or whether they were Jews or other prisoners. And he also couldn't say what happened afterward.\n\n'I didn't see anyone come out,' he said.\n\nHe testified that, on another occasion, he saw a group of 10 or 15 men being led into the gas chamber, but they then came out and were taken to the crematorium building by people in white overalls. He heard that the prisoners were supposed to work outside the camp and had to be checked first, he said.\n\nDey said he and around 400 other soldiers were brought to Stutthof in June or July 1944 and he didn't know at the time what kind of people were incarcerated there.

The former SS man is being prosecuted in a juvenile court because he was 17 when he first arrived at Stutthof\n\nThough there is no evidence that Dey was involved in a specific killing at the camp near Danzig, today the Polish city of Gdansk, prosecutors argue that as a guard he helped the camp function.\n\nDespite his age, Dey is being tried in a juvenile court because he was 17 when he started serving at Stutthof.\n\nHe faces a possible six months to 10 years in prison if convicted.
