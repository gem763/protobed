They took away all the cattle in the villages,\" he said.\n\n\"They operated for two hours unchallenged (by any security forces) because of the difficulty of the terrain which makes it hard to access,\" said the chief.\n\nAlu Ibrahim, a resident of the village of Kamitau, where 23 people died, said villagers had pursued the bandits in a bid to recover their stolen cattle -- key to survival in the poor, remote region.\n\n\"The bandits turned their guns on them and killed many. This was the reason for the high death toll from Kamitau,\" said Ibrahim.\n\nCriminal gangs of cattle rustlers have increasingly targeted rural communities in Sokoto state.\n\nLast month, motorcycle-riding bandits killed 43 people in two days of attacks on five villages in Rabah and Isa districts, according police and locals.\n\nRural communities in the north of Nigeria have for years been terrorised by gangs who raid villages, stealing cattle, kidnapping for ransom and burning homes after looting food supplies.\n\nVillagers have taken up arms to defend themselves, but these vigilantes are now accused of extra-judicial killings of suspected bandits.\n\nThe bandit gangs are one of a string of security challenges facing Nigeria, including attacks from a Islamic State-backed Boko Haram faction and renewed clashes between livestock herders and farmers.\n\nThis has left the military overstretched and Buhari criticised for failing to protect lives and property, despite promises to boost security.", "description": "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday \"strongly\" condemned recent attacks by cattle raiders on three villages in the country's northwest that officials said killed 37 people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9071/690b6df32a02455e8533eb3a19fac8f1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-21"}
