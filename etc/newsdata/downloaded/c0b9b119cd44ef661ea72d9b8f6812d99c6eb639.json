Obviously against Australia we started really well in the first half but we dropped off (in a 29-25 win). We need to start hard and keep that up for the whole game.\"\n\nWales and Japan are the only two teams at this World Cup to have achieved a perfect played four, won four record in the pool phase, with fellow quarter-finalists England, France and New Zealand's concluding group matches cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nJapan have been earning most of the plaudits for their fast-paced and accurate passing game that has seen them to wins over two established nations in Ireland and Scotland.\n\n\"We know it has been quite hot out here and sweaty, so the passing was unbelievable,\" said Williams of Japan's dramatic 28-21 victory over the Scots in Yokohama on Sunday.\n\n\"Scotland didn't really have any answers.\"", "description": "Liam Williams believes Wales' recent history means they can win the Rugby World Cup for the first time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2841/9df762def15f4112a4bcb64e0cf7e174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
