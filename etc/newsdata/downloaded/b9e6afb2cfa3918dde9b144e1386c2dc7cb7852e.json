But Dorian has already battered the Bahamas, leaving homes under water, cars flipped, trees uprooted and residents praying to be rescued.\n\nAs many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis says at least five people have died in the Abaco Islands as of Monday evening.\n\nCooper is taking shelter in Freeport, the main city on Grand Bahama Island. He spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off on Monday as the storm was still hammering his city. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nHow intense is this storm where you are right now?\n\nThe winds are just extremely powerful. Every tree is bending right now, including the coconut trees and the pine trees that I'm looking [out of the window at.]\n\nThe canal that the house is near \u2014 the water is like the ocean right now. If you can visualize waves in the ocean about four feet, we're getting that kind of push from the wind and the pressure that's over us right now.\n\nIt's really, really remarkable how powerful hurricane Dorian has become, and is sitting right on top of us.\n\nIt has been really quite a nightmare just sitting here ... in broad daylight to watch this whole thing.\n\nHurricane Dorian is hitting the northern Bahamas as a catastrophic Category 5 storm with record 295 km/h winds ripping off roofs, overturning cars and tearing down power lines as hundreds hunker down in schools, churches and shelters. 4:34\n\nWhere are you that it's safe?\n\nI'm actually from the West End of the island, which is very low-lying and probably submerged right now. But the home that I'm in is in the Freeport, Lucaya, resort area. I'm at my cousin's house, and luckily for us, the house is extremely well built. It's standing up quite well to the storm.\n\nWe haven't had any damage in our immediate vicinity. But I can only imagine what the streets look like \u2014 if I were to walk out onto the highways and go onto the main thoroughfares, I'm almost certain that there's going to be all kinds of fallen debris from business signs and from other people's homes.\n\nIt's probably going to be a nightmare just driving through the streets of Grand Bahama, and especially in the downtown area of Freeport as well as through the residential areas here. Because we know that the devastation is just unprecedented. And we're just hoping and praying that we'll get some relief and some assistance here from people around the world.\n\nStrong winds batter Oceanhill Boulevard in Freeport.

And so that's the best we can do right now. We have no water. We won't have any, probably for a very long time.\n\n\n\nYour family's all with you?\n\nI've got my cousins with me. I have no wife or children, so I'm very lucky. But my pets are at the Humane Society. And even the animals on the Islands are being affected. The Grand Bahama Humane Society is being flooded. So I don't know what the condition is like over there.\n\nSo the poor animals that a lot of the Bahamians have taken \u2014 we don't know how they are doing.\n\nWhat about your own house?\n\nI live right on the water's front, probably no more than 100, 110 [feet] from the water's edge. I sealed up my house. I closed every window.\n\nThe water will probably be up to my doorstep, if not above it, when I get to my house later on next week.\n\nYou already had quite a loss of your home and property back in 2016 with Hurricane Matthew, didn't you?\n\nI lost everything that I owned at the time \u2014 even my vehicle. And because we did not know just how devastating that storm was going to be, unfortunately I left all my belongings in the house. And when we came back ... all the windows and boards had come off the home.\n\nEvery appliance was destroyed. Every personal item that I owned. In fact, all of my documents and papers and clothes. And you can only imagine walking into a mess like that.\n\nKeith Cooper spends most of his days in the ocean, as a tour operator. But right now, he's taking shelter in Freeport, the main city on Grand Bahama Island. (Keith Cooper/Facebook)\n\nHave you ever experienced a storm like this one?\n\nNever in my life have I witnessed anything so devastating and horrific. This is the most unbelievable storm I think that has ever hit the islands of the Bahamas, and for that matter any Caribbean island over the last 25 to 30 years.\n\nThis is really a devastating situation down here. All I can say is that we're going to need a lot of help and from a lot of people, because there's going to probably be nothing left for anybody to clean once we have the storm settle down and it's past us and it's moving up the coast of the United States.\n\nAnd what do you say to those people there who are bracing themselves? What advice would you give them at this point?\n\nLeave your house. Do not even take the chance and risk your life and that of your pets. Move away from this ocean. This storm is devastating. It will tear you apart, and it will destroy you and it could possibly kill you.\n\nSo heed my warning: leave. Do not stay on any coastal areas of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Please people, go away, and seek shelter in a safe place.\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear and Jeanne Armstrong with files from The Associated Press. Interview produced by Jeanne Armstrong.
