The result was a torrent of blood that made her fear for her life and resulted in her being admitted to A&E.\n\nMailOnline contacted Mad Tatters Tattoo Parlour in Wellingborough for comment.\n\nAbii Mayes, 17, from Wellingborough, (pictured) had a big scare when her mouth started to bleed unexpectedly\n\nA close-up picture shows the piercing in Abii Mayes' mouth before the 17 year old from Wellingborough started to bleed\n\nAbii explained she feared for her life after losing an impressive amount of blood and heading to the A&E\n\nAbii posted the images to social media on October 21, writing: 'So four days ago I got my tongue pierced.\n\n'When having it pierced it bled and it was very wonky. However I was told after the swelling had gone down it would be fine.\n\n'An hour after having it done it still was bleeding and I returned to the shop and told them I believed it had gone through a vein. The piercers said it was fine and I should leave it to heal and see how it goes from there.'\n\nShe added: 'On the fourth day of having my piercing I was ready to go out and suddenly felt blood running down my tongue.\n\n'I was in the toilet for 20 minutes spitting pure blood with huge clots and was scared for my life due to the amount of blood I had lost.\n\nA picture shows how much blood Abii lost when her new piercing punctured her tongue earlier this month\n\nThe A&E staff were horrified to see how much blood Abii had lost after she used a blanket to control the bleeding\n\n'As soon as I slid the bar out the tongue splurged with even more blood than before.I used a blanket for the blood to fall into.\n\n'We rushed straight over to A&E where the nurses and doctors were extremely shocked with how much blood I had lost and was immediately seen.'\n\nIn the same post, Abii added that when she returned to the shop to complaint after her A&E trip, she was told that she couldn't be admitted to the shop, as she was a minor.\n\nThe teen added the piercing parlour had been 'more than happy' to pierce her nipple, and had not required ID from her to do so.\n\nAbii had to rush to the hospital when the bleeding wouldn't stop. She said her tongue hurt for four days after the initial piercing, before starting to bleed on its own\n\nAbii said the tattoo parlour where she got pierced refused to let her in when she went to complain after the ordeal.
