They worked as gardeners, housemaids and cooks in houses, hotels and resorts \u2014 until Hurricane Dorian\u2019s ferocious winds and rains swept away their homes.\n\n\u201cI would like for somebody to help me and my baby,\u201d said Altima, 39, as her 2-year-old son, Berkley, played inside a Haitian church in Nassau. \u201cI don\u2019t have any place to go and nobody here.\u201d\n\nHaitians are the largest minority group in this nation of 400,000 people. By some estimates, they make up as much as one-fifth of the population. The country has long relied on their labor \u2014 and debated whether and how to grant them citizenship.\n\nMany remain undocumented and vulnerable: Dorian flattened shantytowns such as the Mudd and the Peas on Great Abaco Island, killing dozens and leaving thousands homeless.\n\nIn the wake of Dorian, the Bahamian government has suspended deportations of victims from the Abacos and Grand Bahama. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis has declared that all services will be provided to all victims.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister himself has stated that there is to be no discrimination against any nationality,\u201d Carl Smith, spokesman for the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency, said at a briefing Thursday. \u201cThere is no discrimination.\u201d\n\nBut Haitians and their advocates say they have suffered a history of discrimination here and fear they will be targeted for more abuse once the aid groups and news cameras leave. They and the Haitian government are asking for more protection.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like Haitians in this country,\u201d said Julie Oliboice, 28, who was born in Haiti but said she is a naturalized citizen of the Bahamas. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to help the Haitians.\u201d\n\n[When Hurricane Dorian blew through the Bahamas, it exposed one of the world\u2019s great faultlines of inequality]\n\n\n\nHurricane Dorian flattened the Mudd and the Peas neighborhoods of Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco Island.

(Dante Carrer/Reuters)\n\nThe U.S. State Department has noted \u201cwidespread\u201d claims of discrimination, including reports of forced labor, allegations of government extortion and warrantless arrests.\n\nHaitians grew from less than 4 percent of the population in 1970 to nearly 12 percent in 2010, according to the government. Some researchers say the number is probably larger. Thousands are estimated to be here illegally, and thousands more are stateless: They were born here but don\u2019t have citizenship. The Bahamas does not grant birthright citizenship to the children of noncitizens.\n\nSome Haitians said they were turned away this week from the Kendal G.L. Isaacs National Gymnasium, one of the largest shelters, but others received meals and airbeds, the Haitian Embassy confirmed. Soldiers at the shelter said it was full. Officials did not allow reporters in.\n\nLaurie Ferguson, a 46-year-old Bahamian, stood outside the shelter this week in a yellow vest. She had volunteered to help.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any form of discrimination,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there was discrimination, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nDorval Darlier, charge d\u2019affaires at the embassy, said Haitians were being treated well at the shelters. He was compiling lists of hurricane victims in hopes the Bahamian government would grant them amnesty, allowing allow them to stay in the Bahamas to work and to help rebuild.\n\n\u201cI cannot tell them how to govern their country,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course they need Haitians. They need the Haitian labor. The Haitians participate in the construction of this great country.\u201d\n\nThe Bahamian government, still in the midst of disaster relief, has not yet responded to the Haitian request.\n\nThe debate in the Bahamas has echoes in the United States and other countries where Haitians have sought refuge from poverty, repression and political turmoil.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants have urged the Bahamas not to expel Haitians in the wake of Dorian and the United States not to deport Bahamians.\n\n[Crews in the Bahamas keep finding bodies. The official Hurricane Dorian death toll is rising more slowly.]\n\n\n\nPaul Justin, pastor at Solid Rock Baptist Church in Nassau, speaks with Haitians who evacuated from Great Abaco Island. (Maria Sacchetti/The Washington Post)\n\nPaul Justin, pastor at Solid Rock Baptist Church, a sea-green chapel in a Nassau neighborhood much like the ones destroyed on Abaco, took donated clothes to Haitians in shelters and at church members\u2019 houses.\n\nAt a little white house in Nassau, he found four cousins, all men, who had been sleeping on a church volunteer\u2019s floor. They said they hoped contractors would hire them to help rebuild Abaco. They said work permits were costly and hard to get before the storm, and Haitians are often paid little.\n\n\u201cEven though we have the same color as them, they treat us very differently,\u201d said Rockens Elie, 25, an undocumented laborer who lived on Abaco.\n\nOn Fifth Avenue in Nassau, Justin found a family of eight who lived under a mango tree in the Mudd. They were sleeping on a friend\u2019s living room floor.\n\nSainvernio D\u2019Haiti, 38, a construction worker who has lived in the Bahamas since 1993, recently fell from a two-story roof and cannot work.\n\nHis niece, Theresa, 18, is the only family member born in the Bahamas. She speaks English with a Bahamian accent but is considered Haitian.\n\nTheresa D\u2019Haiti said she cannot afford college here. She said she has applied for citizenship but has not heard back.\n\nJustin, the pastor, tried to comfort them. \u201cI know that you\u2019re traumatized,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember you have life. There is hope.\u201d\n\nAt the Solid Rock church hall, Thamika Petit-Jean, a 13-year-old girl born in the Bahamas, looked frustrated and bored. Before the storm, she lived with her Haitian mother and 15-year-old twin sisters in Murphy Town. Now they are homeless, and her mother appears lost.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d the girl said.\n\n[In Dorian\u2019s wake, a shattered town haunted by its missing]\n\n\n\nHurricane Dorian left mountains of debris in its wake and flattened the Mudd and the Peas enclaves.
