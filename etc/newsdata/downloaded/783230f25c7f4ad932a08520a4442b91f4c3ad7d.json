His latest, prehistoric action tale Primal, hits Adult Swim this week \u2014 and we got the chance to talk to him about it.\n\nThe show \u2014 about a caveman and a dinosaur, fighting to survive as both an Odd Couple-esque duo and a deadly fighting team in the harshest environment imaginable \u2014 has a slightly unusual structure; it\u2019ll be airing each night this week, with more to come next year.\n\n\u201cWe have 10 episodes total,\u201d Tartakovsky explained. \u201cBecause we could only have five ready this year, we decided to release these five, and then the next set is next year.\u201d\n\nWill Primal return for more, after its first 10 episodes? Tartakovsky hopes so: \u201cSo far it\u2019s been received very positively, and I think the network is being very supportive. At the same time, we haven\u2019t gotten ratings and all that good stuff in yet, so we\u2019ll see \u2014 but I think everybody\u2019s very excited about the show.\u201d\n\nWe got a chance to check out the first four episodes of Primal ahead of our interview with Tartakovsky, but won\u2019t be getting into plot specifics at all \u2014 other than to say you won\u2019t want to miss this wonderful, brutal, totally unique new series.\n\nGenndy Tartakovsky: I wanted to do something different, especially after doing the last season of Samurai Jack and doing something more adult. I really enjoyed it. There\u2019s things that we have to do for family audiences that are sometimes limiting. You know, as much variety as we\u2019ve done, sometimes you kind of feel like you\u2019re holding back. Because the last season of Samurai Jack was received so well, and everybody kind of talked about the visual sequences \u2014 the sequences without any dialogue \u2014 it kind of came into my mind, like, could I actually just do those sequences? Can I tell a story that way, and can I make a series like that? I started to get excited about that idea because it\u2019s so new and different for me.\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019d been playing around with this boy riding a little dinosaur idea that I had for a long time. None of the stories that I had were clicking with it, and then when this started to come together, I realised, \u201cOh, I could do something really different.\u201d So the two thoughts met, and I updated my idea to be much more adult and gritty and more pulpy.\n\nEddy: Since not incorporating dialogue was the plan from the start, did you encounter any pushback to the idea at all?\n\nTartakovsky: It\u2019s been nothing but support. I think if anybody questioned it, it was me, because when we were putting together the first episode, when we started to get sequences in and edit it together without any music or sound effects, I was watching it and I started to get nervous. I started to think, \u201cWait, are people going to miss the dialogue because we\u2019re so used to it? You see a character, why isn\u2019t he saying anything?\u201d\n\nBut then once we started to fill in with the sound effects and the music, and him screaming and grunting \u2014 so we know he can talk, he just doesn\u2019t know how \u2014 then it filled in those missing gaps and everything was working great. One of the greatest things that came from it was that people felt like they had to really pay attention. That\u2019s what you want, you want people to be completely dialed in and not on their phones or anything. Just watching the show.\n\nEddy: Primal is set in a fantasy version of past \u2014 obviously, since it shows dinosaurs and humans together \u2014 but did you still end up doing any kind of scientific research going into the show?\n\nTartakovsky: It\u2019s not reality, of course. But at the same time, while it\u2019s a fantasy world, we do a lot of things that are realistic. Even though the crutch of the science is completely made up, we tried to do real anatomy, we tried to do some more historical things. But at the end of the day, yeah, it\u2019s science fiction for sure.\n\nIt\u2019s fantasy, it\u2019s pulp, it\u2019s our caveman Conan, whatever that means. It has more of that than anything else. We wanted it to be fun and dark and different in tone than what you\u2019ve seen in that past \u2014 that was a big goal, to have some kind of different experience.\n\nEddy: The show does an incredible job balancing these huge, life-or-death action sequences with funny and sometimes even sweet moments. There\u2019s even a poop joke at one point! How did you set about finding the right tone to support that emotional balance?\n\nTartakovsky: It was challenging! I\u2019m actually not a very violent person \u2014 I don\u2019t like gore and guts and horror. I\u2019m actually kind of a softie. So we wanted the intensity that you get from that, but at the same time, we wanted it to be a character story.\n\nAt the end of the day, if this show succeeds, I think it will be because of the relationship \u2014 we wanted this man and beast relationship, not like specifically a man and dog, where the man controls the dog, but kind of equals. How did these two creatures who share a very similar tragedy, how does that bond them to be together and help them survive this horrific world?\n\nAnd yet I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re saying that [it\u2019s also funny and tender]. It\u2019s kind of hard to sell that emotion in a trailer, so we made the trailers very intense and violent. But there\u2019s a lot of heart and emotion, and the more you connect with these characters and the more you see how much they care for each other, the more intense the violence is going to be. That\u2019s what\u2019s exciting: We\u2019re doing something a little different and not just violence for violence\u2019s sake, because we can.\n\nEddy: You mentioned a man and his dog, but did you have any other specific inspirations behind the relationship between the caveman and the dinosaur?\n\nTartakovsky: It\u2019s really my dog, in a way. I have this giant St. Bernard and she is a terror, and she doesn\u2019t listen, and we love her so much. But there\u2019s a lot of little things that she does that \u2014 I think a lot of animals do, it\u2019s not just completely dog-specific. I definitely mined a lot of that feeling from our relationship.\n\nYou know, we\u2019ve always talked about doing things that the audience finds accessible. On Dexter\u2019s Lab, it was the brother-sister relationship \u2014 that\u2019s what we kind of got right. So for this, we needed a relationship to hang everything else on. These two animals, to a degree, have to find a way to survive together \u2014 and myself and [my dog] have to find a way to survive together [laughs], so there\u2019s a lot of little nuances that we picked up on and put it into the show.\n\nEddy: Based on a certain campfire scene on Primal, I\u2019m guessing your dog might snore.\n\nTartakovsky: She soooo snores [laughs].\n\nEddy: Now that we\u2019ve acknowledged the more tender moments on Primal \u2014 there also are tons of fight scenes, and they\u2019re all so intense. What kind of planning went into those sequences?\n\nTartakovsky: It\u2019s funny because we\u2019ve done so many fights through Samurai Jack and Clone Wars and Sym-Bionic Titan, it\u2019s kind of become somewhat second nature. Like, if you were to ask me what was the most challenging thing, it wouldn\u2019t be the action.\n\nIn this case, the hardest thing about the fights was to come up with a new fighting style. I didn\u2019t want to do martial arts, I didn\u2019t want [the caveman character] to seem like he\u2019s got kung fu training with a spear. I wanted it to be very brutal, very ape-like.\n\nSo, I did look at some apes fighting and mannerisms \u2014 the more intense things get, the more on-all-fours he gets, and walks and fights more like a gorilla. You wanted it to have that individuality that\u2019s very specific to him. So that was one of the little challenging things.\n\nThe bigger thing was, \u201cOh my god, I\u2019ve never drawn a T-rex before. I\u2019ve never drawn a T-rex fighting.\u201d That\u2019s a whole new thing; she uses her mouth, her feet. Those are all new things for a creature to use, and that brought in some fresh things that we could storyboard and mess around with.\n\nI\u2019ve always treated action as a musical sequence. It\u2019s got rhythm, it\u2019s got highs and lows, it\u2019s got fast and slow parts. That kind of dictates the way we go with it. And the fights are fun \u2014 that\u2019s the great thing about it! It wasn\u2019t just another samurai fight with a sword that we\u2019ve done so much. It was completely unique: A hundred raptors chasing them and then fighting while they\u2019re running was super difficult to do, but at the same time super fun.\n\nEddy: Just to pull out something you brought up just now. Primal doesn\u2019t go out of its way to confirm that the dinosaur is female, but it\u2019s implied...\n\nTartakovsky: Yeah, I mean I think it\u2019s something that you can infer. It felt more interesting as a female and a male together. It made it one level more interesting because she\u2019s a mother, she has lost; he\u2019s a father, he has lost. And now the two are together.\n\nEddy: What artwork inspired you and your team when you were designing the look of the show?\n\nTartakovsky: Scott Wills is the one who does all the painting, and Christian Schellewald does all the drawing. Basically, Christian draws almost like kind of a Moebius-y style where it\u2019s much more illustrative. Even though he\u2019s worked in animation for a long time, his background is much more illustration. So that brings right away a different mindset to the way he composes.\n\nIt makes it a little bit more \u201chim\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s just the way he draws, really. That\u2019s when you really know you\u2019ve struck gold, is when you find somebody with such a unique style that you just want to do their style. So he\u2019s amazing.\n\nAnd then when Scott and I were talking about what Primal is going to look like, we\u2019re both \u201870s kids, and so we love the grittiness of the \u201870s, the cinema of the \u201870s, and the sci-fi paintings. Of course Frank Frazetta is a huge influence for both of us, so we looked at a lot of his paintings. That was always the gold standard: How could you make a Frank Frazetta painting come alive? They\u2019re so beautiful and iconic and there\u2019s so much to it.\n\nSo Scott started to develop this look, working with Christian\u2019s background, and how the two were going to blend together. At the same time, we knew we didn\u2019t want to just repeat what we\u2019d done in Jack \u2014 we wanted to push further for the world to come alive and to define itself under Primal. We referred everything to the title of the show to make sure it\u2019s the rawest and most savage that it can be, or the simplest.\n\nThat started to really come together like that, and we also looked at a lot of sci-fi illustrations, paintings, and of course some of the Ralph Bakshi stuff. We wanted this gritty, not-clean, textural linework, very drawn show. And then when we started the character design, it fell into place.\n\nThe initial character designs I was doing were much more [Osamu] Tezuka-influenced, they kind of looked more like Astro Boy. Like a man version of Astro Boy. And I realised, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s too derivative, number one, and it just doesn\u2019t feel like it fits any more with the direction that we\u2019re going.\u201d So then myself and Stephen DeStefano started doing these drawing that are much grittier, more comic book-y illustrations.\n\nThere\u2019s a very big mould for animation, for the way you can do things, and a lot of animation designs start to blend together. So we wanted to kind of push away a little bit. There\u2019s a certain familiarity with what we end up with, but at the same time, it\u2019s a little bit unique to itself.\n\nEddy: The episode titles read a bit over the top, but once you see them in context they are perfect. My favourite is the genuinely scary \u201cTerror Under the Blood Moon\u201d! You mentioned earlier that you\u2019re not a big horror fan, but did you always know you wanted to do a horror episode?\n\nTartakovsky: For sure. There\u2019s sometimes a fine line between horror and monster movie, and I like when I\u2019m doing horror, I just don\u2019t like watching horror. I like thrillers \u2014 I like the suspense, versus just the cheap scare around the corner. It\u2019s funny that you mention the titles because they\u2019re the most pulpy, cheesy thing about it, but that\u2019s what gives it its framework, and because the show is, I think, honest to what it\u2019s trying to do, it kind of connects.\n\nAnd yeah, that episode, the fourth episode was titled \u201cThe Killing Fields\u201d because they\u2019re just in this field of terror. And then Scott painted this red moon, and I was like \u201cOh yeah! Blood moon.\u201d And it changed the framework of the episode, which was great.\n\nWe\u2019re all trying to tell the same story, either with colour or with music or with visuals or with action. And that\u2019s the amazing part of it, once you watch episodes five through 10, they\u2019re completely different than the first four. Each one has its palette, each one has its own unique story, and that\u2019s what I think is fun about the show.", "description": "Animator and director Genndy Tartakovsky already has a string of well-known credits to his name, like Samurai Jack, Star Wars: Clone Wars, Dexter\u2019s Laboratory and the Hotel Transylvania films.
