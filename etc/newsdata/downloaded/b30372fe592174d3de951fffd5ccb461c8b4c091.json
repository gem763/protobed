Max Rose (D-NY) said Friday that President Donald Trump should \u201cprove\u201d his innocence regarding the impeachment charges Democrats have levied against him.\n\nRose \u2014 a freshman Democrat that represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, New York \u2014 said Friday that President Trump is the sole person to blame after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) started an impeachment inquiry into him.\n\nDuring his travels throughout Staten Island on the campaign trail, Rose has brushed off his support for impeachment, suggesting that he did not want to back impeachment of Trump. Rose pinned the blame on President Trump, claiming that he forced Democrats\u2019 hand on impeachment.\n\nThe Staten Island Democrat suggested that President Trump has to \u201cprove\u201d his innocence, rather than have Democrats prove that he committed an impeachable offense during his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cI do not want to be here. This is the last thing I want to be doing,\u201d Rose said. \u201cBut no one is to blame but the president. The president says he is innocent, so all we are saying is \u2018prove it.\u2019 But that is not what they are doing. They are not cooperating, and we need to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Rose also blamed Republicans for going \u201cdeaf, mute, and blind whenever allegations against the president are brought up.\u201d\n\nRose\u2019s comment mirrors those of Democrats during the Senate confirmation of then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. In September 2018, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) refused to say whether Kavanaugh was presumed innocent. Hirono instead said that his accuser needed \u201cto be believed.\u201d\n\nRose\u2019s rhetoric on impeachment has appeared to have shifted dramatically. Last month, the New York Democrat wrote an op-ed in which he urged Democrats to focus on their agenda.\n\n\u201cWe are in danger of losing the trust of the American people if we choose partisan warfare over improving the lives of hardworking families,\u201d he claimed.\n\nRose\u2019s message mirrors other vulnerable 2020 Democrat representatives such as Rep. Susan Wild (D-PA). Wild said last week that moderate Democrats need to ensure that impeachment does not \u201covershadow\u201d their legislative agenda.\n\nRose also slammed former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and his position on a Ukrainian oil company, Burisma.\n\n\u201cIt was the wrong decision for Hunter Biden to be on that board. In no way, shape, or form should someone\u2019s public service benefit their family,\u201d\n\nHowever, he quickly pivoted toward attacking President Trump\u2019s family.\n\nRose said:\n\nBut if we are going to question Hunter Biden, we should also question Donald Trump Jr. and the way his companies have benefited, and not just Donald Trump Jr., but the other guy \u2014 the one who is even less impressive. What\u2019s his name again? Eric! That\u2019s right, Eric.\n\nNew York Republicans have moved to highlight Rose\u2019s shifting positions on impeachment.\n\nJessica Proud, a top New York GOP operative who worked for Rose\u2019s opponent in 2018, said, \u201cStaten Island is Trump country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are very resistant to the notion of leftist elitists in Washington who are perpetually offended by everything. They view this as just an attempt to get Trump out, and I don\u2019t see how it is going to serve Rose,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt cuts right to the heart of the brand he is trying to create for himself, that is going to go to Washington and not join the partisan fray. It puts him squarely in the Democratic camp,\u201d Proud added.", "description": "Max Rose said Friday that Donald Trump should \"prove\" his innocence regarding the impeachment charges Democrats have levied against him.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/max-rose-podium-speech-microphone-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
