I have no update right now.\u201d\n\nEU negotiator Michel Barnier said a text must be on the table by early Wednesday if it is to be put before leaders at the two-day EU summit starting Thursday.\n\nA special sitting of the British parliament is scheduled for Saturday.\n\nIf the early-Wednesday deadline is missed, officials said talks could always resume next week and a special summit be called just in time for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to fulfil his pledge to lead Britain out of the bloc on October 31.\n\nOne European source told AFP that it was \u201cpossible\u201d a preliminary legal text could be reached perhaps by late Tuesday. But another was unable to confirm any breakthrough.\n\nVaradkar said: \u201cWhether we\u2019ll be able to conclude a revised withdrawal agreement, which after all is an international treaty, in time for the summit on Thursday, that\u2019s as of now unclear.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Positive momentum\u2019 \u2013\n\nEuropean leaders are firm that, while they are keen for a deal, they will not let Britain use Northern Ireland as a back door to the single market.\n\nThey have been urging London to go beyond broad proposals on the table if a deal is to be done this month. Johnson is said to have given ground on customs rules for Northern Ireland in a bid to reach a formal text.\n\nBarnier said as he arrived in Luxembourg to brief EU ministers that he was cautiously optimistic but that \u201cit is high time to turn good intentions into legal text.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron apparently shared the guarded optimism, with an aide telling reporters there was \u201cpositive momentum\u201d behind the talks.\n\nDowning Street said Johnson had called Macron and had a \u201cconstructive\u201d and \u201cgood discussion\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe want to make progress towards securing a deal as soon as possible and we want to make progress ahead of the EU council on Thursday,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nBut German Chancellor Angela Merkel outlined why EU officials are driving a hard bargain and hoping Britain will commit to a \u201clevel playing field\u201d in post-Brexit trade and commerce.\n\n\u201cOne thing is clear, Britain will develop into another competitor on the doorstep of Europe,\u201d she told industrialists. \u201cAnd therefore the EU will be challenged to become more competitive and to assume geopolitical responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Glimmer of hope \u2013\n\n\u201cThe last moment is always a bit later than you think,\u201d one German government official told AFP, suggesting that Brexit day would have to be postponed beyond the end of the month if talks are to succeed.\n\n\u201cI am sceptical that we will have a full agreement tomorrow (Wednesday) on a legal text \u2026 the question is whether the work can be done in the next few days or whether it will take another two months.\u201d\n\nBritish Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay joined Barnier in Luxembourg in what was seen as a positive sign for the talks, and said \u201ca deal is still very possible\u201d.\n\nBarclay later tweeted a picture of himself with Irish, Polish, Greek, Swedish and Portuguese counterparts, saying they shared his desire to \u201cget Brexit done.\u201d\n\nMore than three years after Britain\u2019s 2016 referendum vote to leave, talks remain stuck on how to avoid customs checks on the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.\n\nThe EU has reservations about London\u2019s proposed customs arrangements and the role for Northern Ireland\u2019s Stormont assembly in giving consent to the plans.\n\n\u201cJohnson has modified his original proposals to the effect that he has clearly stated that there will be no customs border on the Irish border,\u201d a European diplomat told AFP.\n\nIf no deal is reached by Saturday, Johnson will fall foul of a British law demanding he ask the EU to postpone Brexit for a third time rather than risk a potentially disastrous \u201cno deal\u201d departure.\n\nburs-dc-pdw-rmb/dt", "description": "Brussels (AFP) \u2013 Britain and the EU were seen to be closing in on a detailed draft Brexit deal on Tuesday, although officials voiced scepticism it", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/15/f25d48_weeks-gloom-few-days-glimmer-hope-brexit-deal-can-reached-eu-uk-closing-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
