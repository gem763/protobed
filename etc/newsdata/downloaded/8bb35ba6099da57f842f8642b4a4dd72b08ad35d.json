Josi is in the final year of a seven-year, $28 million contract and would have become a free agent on July 1.\n\nIn a news conference announcing the signing on Tuesday, Josi, 29, said there is nowhere else he\u2019d rather play.\n\n\u201cI love everything about the city,\u201d said Josi, who is Swiss. \u201cWe have the best fans in the league. This city is home.\u201d\n\n\u2014Colorado Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog is out indefinitely because of a lower-body injury.\n\nLandeskog, 26, played in the team\u2019s most recent game \u2014 a 5-2 loss to the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday \u2014 and practiced on Sunday, but the team did not announce when or how the injury occurred.\n\nThe left winger has three goals and four assists in 11 games this season. Landeskog posted career-bests in goals (34) and assists (41) last season while playing in 73 games.\n\n\u2014Made a healthy scratch for the second straight game, Chicago Blackhawks alternate captain Brent Seabrook expressed his frustration.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been playing good,\u201d Seabrook told reporters in Nashville, where the Blackhawks were scheduled to play the Predators on Tuesday night. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously been on for some goals against. Tough situation, but I feel like I\u2019m skating better. I feel like I\u2019ve got a lot to offer this team.\u201d\n\nThe veteran defenseman was also a healthy scratch before Chicago played the visiting Los Angeles Kings on Sunday night, when the Blackhawks ended a four-game losing streak with a 5-1 victory.\n\n\u2014Pittsburgh Penguins forward Alex Galchenyuk and defenseman Brian Dumoulin were activated after their recent stints on injured reserve.\n\nGalchenyuk, who was traded from the Arizona Coyotes to the Penguins in a June deal for veteran forward Phil Kessel, was limited during the preseason because of an undisclosed injury. He had been on IR since Oct. 9.\n\nDumoulin, who sustained a lower-body injury, has three assists in eight games. He is in his seventh season with the Penguins.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Defenseman Roman Josi signed an eight-year deal with the Nashville Predators on Tuesday, with the contract carrying an annual average value of just more than $9 million.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446353447&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T00Q-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
