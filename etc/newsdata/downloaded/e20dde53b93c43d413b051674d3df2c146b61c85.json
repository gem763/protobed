'He don't f*** with black people, so if you f*** with Donald Trump, you racist as f*** and I can't f*** with you - period.'\n\nThe song was a the center of a controversy after Hussle's March 31 killing, when Fox News personalities Laura Ingraham and Raymond Arroyo snickered their way through an segment on The Ingraham Angle in April about Hussle's funeral, and his collaboration with YG.\n\nUpset: When the man refused, 'No you won't? Get his a** out of here, get him off stage! F*** up on out of here!'\n\nOutspoken: YG is one of many musical artists to publicly speak out about the president\n\n'Yesterday in L.A., thousands lined the streets to say goodbye to rapper Nipsey Hussle ... now this dear artist recently released a song called FDT,' she said. 'Now that's a very creative refrain ... the chorus it goes on and on.\n\n'Is that related to the lowest unemployment ever basically for African Americans?'\n\nThe tone of the segment prompted an outcry of anger toward the right wing host, as Snoop Dogg, The Game, T.I. and Justin Bieber were among the prominent names calling for blowback against Ingraham and her employer.", "description": "YG invited the fan onstage and referred to how when he'd spotted him in the crowd and asked him if he liked the president, the fan didn't know.", "authors": ["Adam S.
