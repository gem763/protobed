An aging patient population and rising burden of chronic disease have caused healthcare costs to skyrocket and left providers struggling to keep up with demand for care.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nMeanwhile, digital technologies in nearly every consumer experience outside of healthcare have raised patients' expectations for good service to be higher than ever.\n\nOne of the key mechanisms through which healthcare providers can finally evolve their outdated practices and exceed these expectations is wearable technology.\n\nPresently, 33% of US consumers have adopted wearables, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, to play a more active role in managing their health. In turn, insurers, providers, and employers are poised to become just as active leveraging these devices - and the data they capture - to abandon the traditional reimbursement model and improve patient outcomes with personalized, value-based care.\n\nAdoption is going to keep climbing, as more than 80% of consumers are willing to wear tech that measures health data, according to Accenture \u2014 though they have reservations about who exactly should access it.\n\nA new report from Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, follows the growing adoption of wearables and breadth of functions they offer to outline how healthcare organizations and stakeholders can overcome this challenge and add greater value with wearable technology.\n\nFor insurers, providers, and employers, wearables present three distinct opportunities:\n\nInsurers can use wearable data to enhance risk assessments and drive customer lifetime value.
