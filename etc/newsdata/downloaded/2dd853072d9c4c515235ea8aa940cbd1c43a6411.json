Already, Hong Kong has canceled fireworks planned for the anniversary in light of the unrest.\n\nThe tensions also showed that public anger with the police continues to run high after a number of incidents this summer that many people believe involved excessive force. Two months ago, in one of those incidents, police charged protesters with batons and pepper spray inside the New Town Plaza mall in Sha Tin, the site of Sunday\u2019s protests.\n\nSunday\u2019s protest included a large collection of origami cranes.

The smell of spray paint\u2014which demonstrators used to cover parts of the mall with antigovernment and anti-China slogans\u2014permeated the air.\n\nLater, protesters built another barricade outside the mall and set it ablaze to defend their front lines before riot police fired tear gas and began to charge, chasing protesters around the vicinity of the mall and its surrounding park and town hall. Protesters hurled trash cans and other debris at police from an elevated walkway as police crossed under. Most of the crowd dispersed before nightfall.\n\nThe scuffles on the 16th straight weekend of protests create a challenge for authorities ahead of two crucial anniversaries that are expected to draw huge crowds. This coming weekend will mark the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the pro-democracy \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d protests, while Oct. 1 is the 70th anniversary of the founding of People\u2019s Republic of China. Some of the posters put up Sunday called for the whole city on Oct. 1 to wear black, the unofficial color of the protests.\n\nThe mood on the ground is creating more tension rather than relieving it. Protesters\u2019 use of firebombs has increased, and a police officers\u2019 association warned that officers could respond with live ammunition. Meanwhile, the government has resisted calls for a judge-led inquiry into incidents of police handling of the protests.\n\nEarlier this month, the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, acceded to one of the protesters\u2019 five demands: the withdrawal of an extradition bill that would have allowed for suspects to be tried on the mainland. But protests have persisted, with demonstrators saying they would not back down until their other demands are met. They include democratic reform and amnesty for protesters. They also include the independent investigation into how police have handled the protests, something public polls have consistently shown to be a top concern. Mrs. Lam has said an existing police-commission inquiry is sufficient.\n\nAs police moved in, protesters on Sunday used objects from the mall including oil, soap and water, to slick the floors and deter police.

Residents were angry at mall manager Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. over the fact that police had been let in at the time. The company didn\u2019t answer phone calls outside regular business hours Sunday.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, hundreds of residents of all ages, a number of them unmasked, gathered in the atrium of the mall. They hung banners calling for support for the protesters and pointing to China\u2019s suppression of Tibet and Xinjiang. Anti-China stickers, posters and spray-painted slogans were visible throughout the mall. At one point, they defaced and stepped on the Chinese national flag, dragging it around the mall before some protesters threw it into a nearby river.\n\nThe hard-core protesters who typically hold the front lines put on hard hats and masks and rushed through the crowd, as news of the riot police\u2019s arrival circulated. Shops such as Zara and cosmetics outlet Chanel Beaut\u00e9 that had remained open during the rally quickly closed as the scuffles began and mall management asked shoppers to calmly leave.\n\n\u201cEvery time the police come through there is a fight,\u201d said one 68-year-old grandmother surnamed Ko. She said she had the day off from taking care of her grandchildren, aged 4 to 16, and came because she wanted to show support for the young people in the front lines.\n\n\u201cThe future belongs to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government needs to listen to their demands.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, shops also closed as a group of protesters faced off with police in the Elements shopping mall across the city. On Saturday evening, hundreds gathered at a shopping center near a subway station in Yuen Long to mark the two-month anniversary of an attack by a group of white-shirted men, which left dozens of protesters and bystanders injured.\n\nThat attack helped magnify the focus of the protests from the extradition bill to the conduct of police. Many protesters believe police didn\u2019t do enough to protect people and haven\u2019t made finding the perpetrators of that attack a priority. Police have charged some in relation to the attacks in recent weeks.\n\nProtesters set fire to improvised barricades during a clash with police in Sha Tin.

One police official said there were situations in the past when lethal force would have been justified but wasn\u2019t used, which is evidence of officers\u2019 restraint.\n\nFelix Wu, a 64-year-old supermarket worker who lives in Sha Tin, came to the mall Sunday to support the protesters. He said harsh police methods had forced protesters to adopt more violent tactics and was there to help protect them by capturing the action in video on his phone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about the violence to this shopping mall,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cI worry about the protesters. They are facing very brutal violence from the police.\u201d\n\nMany of the protesters said they were getting ready for the coming weekend.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no turning back now,\u201d said Candy Siu, 22, who has been protesting since June. \u201cThese few months have shown us that the government only listens to the Chinese Communist Party, and not us. This is all we have left to make them hear our voice.\u201d\n\n\u2014Mike Cherney contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com", "description": "A peaceful rally at a major suburban shopping mall turned into a battle scene Sunday, after riot police showed up and protesters built barricades and lighted fires.", "authors": ["Natasha Khan", "Natasha.Khan Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109636/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
