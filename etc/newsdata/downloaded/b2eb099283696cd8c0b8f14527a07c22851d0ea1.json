That could all fall apart though based on how she performs in court.\n\nThere is no body or murder weapon, so it is her testimony that will convict Frazee - unless his lawyers are successful in arguing that she was the one who plotted the murder of Berreth.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nVictim?: Krystal Kenney was asked to murder Berreth on four occasions she told prosecutors, but never told police officers about Frazee's plot (Michelle Stein above with Krystal Lee Kenney)\n\nDefending a friend: In a new episode of 48 Hours that will air Saturday at 10pm on CBS, Kenney's friend Michelle Stein (above) says she knew of the murder plot before Berreth's death\n\nIn a new clip from the episode, Stein discusses how she came to learn that Kenney was being asked to commit murder by Frazee, with whom she was having an affair.\n\n'She told me that he had asked her to take care of his baby mama,' said Michelle Stein in a preview for 48 Hours.\n\nThat left Stein 'shocked' she said, but not enough to reach out to law enforcement.\n\nNikki Batiste, who is anchoring this week's episode, expressed some shock of her own at how quickly Stein was able to seemingly dismiss what ultimately proved to be a very real threat.\n\n'I would think you would say, call the police, talk to my friend, someone's asking her to kill someone,' said Batiste.\n\n'But do you have regret?'\n\nStein, who grew increasingly nervous throughout the exchange, teared up as she responded: 'You're right. Of course I regret it. I regret it every day.'\n\nIn a previous interview, Stein said that Kenney was driven by fear.\n\n'She had very, very good reasoning for whatever it is she may or may not have done,' said Stein.\n\nWhen pressed for further detail she added: 'I can't really comment completely, but fear. And legitimate fear.'\n\nStein was then asked if Krystal feared that Frazee might murder her next, to which she replied: 'Yes, that's what I believe, yes.'\n\nStein also explained why Krystal would have helped Frazee if this was the case, saying that he was a 'dangerous person.'\n\nVictim: It is claimed that Krystal did not know that Frazee was engaged or had a child until very recently, according to Stein\n\nWhen asked if Krystal had ever stated that she was fearful of Frazee, Stein replied: 'She did tell me that she's never seen that kind of evil in anybody.'\n\nThat is why she agreed to not only dispose of Berreth's phone, but also make texts to her employer and Frazee from the cell.\n\n'I will just tell you Krystal was very, very scared,' said Stein.\n\n'Krystal is a level headed, kind, fun-loving, happy-go-lucky person. She's a tough cowgirl. She was absolutely scared and extremely upset.'\n\nAt this point in the interview Stein begn to cry a bit while thinking about her friend.\n\n'She had very, very good reasoning for whatever it is she may or may not have done,' said Stein.\n\nOne thing she did not do however was participate in the actual murder.\n\n'I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever,' said Stein on that subject.\n\nProsecutors shared their timeline of events earlier this year, depending almost entirely on the claims made by Kenney.\n\nShackled: Frazee plans on arguing that Kenney is responsible for the murder of Berreth at trial, according to documents filed in Teller County, Colorado (Frazee leaving court in December)\n\nTarget: Kenney faces no more than three years behind bars on a single charge of evidence tampering as part of her plea deal with prosecutors (Krystal leaving court in February)\n\nFrazee allegedly killed Berreth on Thanksgiving and then called his mistress Krystal Lee Kenney, telling her that 'she had a mess to clean up.'\n\nKrystal then drove 13 hours overnight from Idaho to Colorado, where she cleaned Berreth's blood-soaked house for four hours, it is claimed.\n\nFrazee meanwhile left the murder scene to have Thanksgiving dinner with his family and then allegedly returned to collect Berreth's body before burning it on a pile of haystacks at a nearby farm, said Slater.\n\nPrior to that, Frazee had asked Krystal to kill Berreth four times, and she almost carried out those orders on two occasions, said Slater.\n\nThe first time was in September, when she befriended Berreth by pretending to be a neighbor and then gave the woman a drug-laced beverage from Starbucks, it is claimed.\n\nFrazee then asked her to bludgeon Berreth with a bat and beat her to death with a pipe, which Krystal told agents she almost did, backing out when she arrived at Berreth's home and saw she was not alone, the court heard.\n\nKrystal had been in Reno on the fourth occasion and could not book a ticket to fly in to Colorado, said Slater.\n\nSlater said that the mistress did all this because she feared for her life and the lives of her two children.\n\nKrystal did not carry out Frazee's final order either, according to Slater, opting to leave two patches of blood as evidence in the house for authorities to find when they searched for evidence.\n\nShe then went to eat at a nearby Sonic.\n\nThe head of the Woodland Park Police testified on Tuesday that when Frazee called Berreth's phone the day after she went missing, both cells pinged at the same exact spot.\n\nThat continued until November 25, at which point the cell began to move westward towards Idaho, at the same time Krystal took the cell to dispose of the evidence.\n\nSlater said Krystal told agents she had purposely pinged towers along the way by turning on the cell from time-to-time.\n\nShe also said that she had disposed of Berreth's gun by giving it to a friend, and tried to avoid detection by driving a friend's car during the trip.\n\nFrazee had wanted to give the appearance that Berreth had killed herself, according to Krystal.\n\nAuthorities got their big break when Krystal took authorities to the location that Frazee allegedly burned the evidence, where they found a burn mark and traces of accelerant.\n\nSlater also said that Frazee and Krystal had been in a relationship since March of last year, confirming the story that DailyMail.com broke last month.\n\nKrystal was not aware that Frazee had a fiancee or a daughter however until July.\n\nKenney was also told by Frazee that Berreth was a drug addict and abused their daughter.", "description": "It has been almost one year since Kelsey Berreth disappeared from her home in Colorado, and later this month her former fiance Patrick Frazee will finally stand trial for her murder.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/9676082-0-image-a-22_1570206090954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
