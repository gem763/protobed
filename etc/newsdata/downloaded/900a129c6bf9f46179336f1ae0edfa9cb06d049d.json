Across Quebec, 53 schools experienced declining performance.\n\nNotably, the schools showing improvement are located across the province, including in Forestville, Sept-Iles, Chibougamau, and Saint-Damien-de-Buckland.\n\nThe fastest-improving school provincewide\u2014Sainte-Marie in Princeville\u2014improved its rating from 4.3 out of 10 in 2014 to 6.9 in 2018.\n\nPolyvalent des Rivieres in Forestville, the second-fastest improver provincewide, improved its rating from 5.5 in 2014 to 8.0 last year. Crucially, more than 40 per cent of its students have special needs (EHDAA).\n\nJeanne-Mance in Montreal continues to show significant improvement this year, rating 4.0 out of 10, compared to 1.8 out of 10 in 2014. In 2013, the school rated just 0.3 out of 10. It, too, has a high percentage of special needs students (46.2 per cent).\n\n\u201cThis Report Card proves that improvement is possible in every corner of the province, in every type of school serving every type of student,\u201d Labrie said.\n\n\u201cParents should use this Report Card every year to assess how their child\u2019s school is doing, and when necessary, ask the principal how he or she plans to turn things around.\u201d\n\nSee detailed results of all 463 schools at www.compareschoolrankings.org .\n\n10 fastest-improving secondary schools in Quebec (fastest at the top)\n\nSchool Location Overall\n\nrating in\n\n2014\n\n(out of 10) Overall\n\nrating in\n\n2018\n\n(out of 10) Sainte-Marie Princeville 4.3 6.9 Polyvalent des Rivieres Forestville 5.5 8.0 Saint-Damien Saint-Damien-de-Buckland 5.9 7.7 Louise-Trichet Montreal 4.4 7.0 Nouvelles Fronti\u00e8res Gatineau 6.8 8.7 Pierre-Dupuy Montreal 2.7 4.5 Jeanne-Mance Montreal 1.8 4.0 Institut d'Enseignement Sept-\u00celes 4.5 6.5 La Porte-du-Nord Chibougamau 6.3 7.9 Du Coteau Mascouche 3.3 5.2\n\nMEDIA CONTACT:\n\nYanick Labrie, Senior Fellow\n\nFraser Institute\n\ncommunications@fraserinstitute.org\n\nTo arrange media interviews or for more information, please contact:\n\nBryn Weese\n\nFraser Institute\n\n(604) 250-8076\n\nbryn.weese@fraserinstitute.org\n\nFollow the Fraser Institute on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe Fraser Institute is an independent Canadian public policy research and educational organization with offices in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal and ties to a global network of think-tanks in 87 countries.
