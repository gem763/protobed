She spent a week in a coma.\n\nHer mother Amy Partridge, 28, was eventually told by doctors that Brogan-Lei needed to have her feet and then both of her legs amputated after contracting septacemia.\n\nAmy Partridge, 28, told how Brogan-Lei Partridge lost both legs to meningitis after A&E medics sent her home with a 'tummy bug'\n\nMedics initially diagnosed a stomach bug, but she was readmitted hours later after her condition worsened and she spent a week in a coma. Her mother was eventually told by doctors that Brogan-Lei needed to have her feet and then both of her legs amputated after contracting septacemia\n\nMs Partridge is now urging parents to be more aware of the symptoms of the potentially deadly condition, as Brogan-Lei tries to reclaim her independence.\n\nThe mother-of-four said: 'We'd just came back from a family break when she contracted Meningitis B, Brogan-Lei was only seven at the time.\n\n'She did not seem herself. She'd had a sleepless night and was vomiting.\n\n'We took her to A&E but they sent us home, saying she only had a tummy bug.\n\n'I didn't know the symptoms of meningitis at the time. But within about three hours of leaving A&E, she was rushed back in after she started getting a rash.\n\nMs Partridge is now urging parents to be more aware of the symptoms of the potentially deadly condition, as Brogan-Lei tries to reclaim her independence.

Pictured before she fell ill\n\nMs Partridge added: 'We're so lucky that she was saved but we were devastated when Brogan-Lei had to have her left foot amputated due to the septicaemia.'\n\n'The damage was done within just a few hours, but only time will tell how much the disease will affect her life.\n\n'We were later told told she will need to have her right foot amputated too.\n\n'When we first found out she was going to lose her legs, we thought there was absolutely no way that could happen.\n\n'I didn't want my little girl to lose her legs but it was the only option.'\n\nFour years on and brave Brogan-Lei, now aged 11, is working on rebuilding her life and becoming independent once again.\n\nHer mother said: 'She was completely oblivious to it all because she was so heavily medicated at the time.\n\n'Her education suffered because of it. But now she's 11, she's adjusted to everything really well.\n\n'She's always had a good mindset and is determined to get her full independence back.'\n\nRob Dawson, Director of Support and Communications for Meningitis Research Foundation, said: 'Meningitis acts quickly and is difficult to spot.\n\n'In the early stages in can be confused with flu but it can kill in less than 24 hours.\n\n'The consequences of bacterial meningitis can be devastating: 1 in 10 will die and many more are left with life-changing impairments, such as brain injury or amputations.\n\nBrogan-Lei and her family pictured.
