They were accompanied over lunch in Luxembourg by the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and U.K. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay.\n\nBoth sides billed the meeting as a chance to \"take stock\" of the talks, but the Commission statement said there had been no game-changing proposals from Johnson's team. \"President Juncker recalled that it is the UK's responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement,\" the Commission statement read. \"President Juncker underlined the Commission's continued willingness and openness to examine whether such proposals meet the objectives of the backstop. Such proposals have not yet been made.\"\n\nAn EU27 diplomat clarified that \u201c'legally operational' means that these solutions can be implemented by day one.\u201d\n\nThe Commission statement said there had been no game-changing proposals from Johnson's team.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the talks had been \"constructive,\" adding: \u201cThe leaders agreed that the discussions needed to intensify and that meetings would soon take place on a daily basis.\"\n\nA second EU27 diplomat expressed pessimism about the chances of a deal. \u201cI\u2019m increasingly convinced there is no plan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only plan is to move [the Irish border problem] into transition,\u201d he added, referring to the standstill period immediately after the U.K. leaves the EU. \u201cThey are willing to do a deal but we don\u2019t like what they seem to offer because it\u2019s way over our red lines.\u201d", "description": "A spokesperson for Boris Johnson says talks would now \u2018intensify\u2019 and will soon take place on a daily basis.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Hans Von Der Burchard", "Neale Richmond", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1168623607-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
