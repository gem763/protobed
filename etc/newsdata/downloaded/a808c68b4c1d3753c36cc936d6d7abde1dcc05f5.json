But as a professional footballer, I have to respect the decision of the coach. Not being involved, watching from home, makes me feel helpless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I want to be part of the side, I want to support my team-mates to succeed. I\u2019m not training all the time just for the sake of it, I\u2019m ready to play. This should not be about me or the coach, only the club. I have to give everything, be fit and focused, and I\u2019m training hard to be ready.\n\n\u2018Pre-season went very well and although things were disrupted by the [moped] attack, since then I\u2019ve been fully available and when the coach has selected me I\u2019ve been ready, played and always tried to give my best.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve trained at the same level my whole career but because I\u2019ve not had minutes recently, I\u2019m doing extra work with the fitness coach and in the gym to get even fitter than normal. I know what is needed and believe in myself.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve worked under some of the biggest coaches in the world \u2014 Arsene, Jose Mourinho, Joachim Low \u2014 and always I show respect. It\u2019s the same for Unai.\n\n\u2018We might not see eye-to-eye on everything but that\u2019s normal, it\u2019s life and it\u2019s the same with my family and friends. You have to accept it and go forward.\u2019\n\n\u2018I will play. I believe in myself to do what he asks of me and I want to help the club to reach our goals.\u2019\n\nMORE: Arsenal issue Alexandre Lacazette injury update ahead of Sheffield United clash\n\nMORE: Mesut Ozil insists he\u2019ll see out Arsenal contract despite struggles under Unai Emery", "description": "Mesut Ozil insists he respects Unai Emery, despite not always seeing 'eye-to-eye' with the Arsenal manager.
