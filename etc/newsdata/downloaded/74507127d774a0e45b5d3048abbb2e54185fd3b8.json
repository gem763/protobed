Over the weekend, the airport became a \"massive mess,\" according to a San Francisco Chronicle report.\n\nSan Francisco Airport (SFO) is the seventh-busiest airport in the US, according to data from the FAA, moving more than 53 million passengers in 2016.\n\nAs hundreds of travelers faced delayed and cancelled flights over the weekend and Monday, some wondered whether the flight reductions \u2014 a 13% decrease \u2014 was enough, and what more could have been done.\n\nMore than 800 flights were delayed between Saturday morning and Monday afternoon, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightAware cited by the Chronicle, with delays averaging an hour. On Tuesday morning, around 85 flights to or from SFO had been cancelled, with another 80 delayed \u2014 the number was likely to increase throughout the day. According to FlightAware, inbound flights were delayed an average of about three-and-a-half hours.\n\nPassengers were left unprepared for the delays, leading many to complain to their airlines on Twitter.\n\nSee also: Apply here to attend IGNITION: Transportation, an event focused on the future of transportation, in San Francisco on October 22.\n\n\"Hey @AmericanAir, would have been nice to know when purchasing tickets to SFO that runways were set to be closed,\" one passenger tweeted. \"Beyond frustrated right now. 3+ hour delays.\"\n\n\"@AlaskaAir 5 hour delay on our 2 hour Seattle to SFO flight due to a PLANNED construction,\" another user asked. \"What part of this was a surprise? Will the flight take off tonight at all?\"\n\nSFO has four runways: two running parallel to each other (10L/28R, and 10R/28L), and another two runways going perpendicular (1L/19R, and 1R/19L), crossing the first two runways.\n\nThe issue is that that in 2017, engineers saw that a 1,900 foot strip of runway 28L was in desperate need of repairs, with pavement in the concrete base layer deteriorating. However, that strip of affected concrete is crossed br the two perpendicular runways \u2014 1L and 1R. That means that repair work isn't as simple as closing one runway and using the others. Take-offs and landings instead need to be coordinated around when crews will be working on the intersecting portions.\n\nThe airport said that it waited until September because it needed dry weather to complete the repairs, and the busy summer travel season made July or August an impractical time to close a runway.\n\nMost major US airlines are letting passengers scheduled to fly to or from SFO to change their flights if they want to \u2014 contact your airline for more details.\n\nThe repairs are expected to continue from September 7-26, with the runway reopening the morning of September 27.", "description": "One of the four runways at SFO will be closed from September 7\u201326.
