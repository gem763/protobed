(Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)\n\nTORONTO \u2014 The marketing materials for \"Jojo Rabbit,\u201d the new World War II comedy that premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on Sunday, contain an unusual proclamation. \u201cAn anti-hate satire\u201d reads the message above the more traditional actor information.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual move for Fox Searchlight, the powerhouse Oscar-generating company bought by Disney earlier this year \u2014 defining the movie\u2019s subgenre amid the marketing hype.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame the specialty studio for taking extreme care in rolling out the Germany-set film, which arrives in theaters Oct. 18. Directed by Marvel filmmaker Taika Waititi (\u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d), \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d tells of a 10-year-old Nazi convinced that he wants to kill Jews; suggests moments of high camp as comic personalities like Rebel Wilson and Stephen Merchant commit gleeful acts of fascism; and features Hitler as a child\u2019s imaginary friend.\n\nThe movie could upset the left for its casual use of Nazi iconography and the right for implying any connections to present conservatism. Conveying its message of unity is, for filmmakers, just as critical as highlighting the comedy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t say \u2018Never forget\u2019 as a joke,\u201d Waititi said after the screening Sunday. \u201cWe have to find new and inventive ways to tell the story and move forward with love.\u201d\n\nIf you haven't heard about \u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d you soon will.\n\nThe film centers on the titular German boy who, in seeking a father figure, embraces Nazism and an imaginary Hitler friend. Then his mother, played by Scarlett Johansson, begins hiding a Jewish girl in their house, complicating the boy\u2019s image of Jews. The movie is high on comedy, sometimes of a cutting-edge modern kind: \u201cWell, I\u2019m massively into swastikas, so,\u201d the boy says when the girl questions whether he is really the anti-Semite he claims. There are plenty of spoof-y jokes besides. But it also seeks to dissect how children come to hate \u2014 no one is, indeed, born racist \u2014 and by implication how that can be stopped.\n\nThe movie\u2019s embrace by the Toronto audience was complete \u2014 multiple standing ovations and rapturous enthusiasm for Waititi and the cast at its premiere. Pundits, however, have been sharply divided.\n\nCommentators like Variety critic Owen Gleiberman extolled the movie and its Oscar potential. The Boston Globe\u2019s Ty Burr noted, \u201cAt long last, a generation has its \u2018Life Is Beautiful,' \u201d referencing the comedy that became an Oscar powerhouse two decades ago.\n\nOthers, however, have not been persuaded. \u201cThe cartoon Nazis in \u2018Jojo Rabbit\u2019 are so far removed from reality that they make it all too easy to laugh off the circumstances at hand,\u201d wrote IndieWire\u2019s Eric Kohn. \u201cThat\u2019s not only crass but disingenuous. Nazis weren\u2019t just a bunch of dopey chumps.\u201d He said the movie \u201cburies the awful truth.\u201d\n\nGearing up for this sort of criticism has been a full-time job for Searchlight, which has been carefully readying its counterplan for months.\n\nThe studio held the movie back from the Telluride Film Festival, a more boutique affair, to premiere at Toronto, which tends to get a larger and more diverse population (if also, given the cost of tickets, a largely upscale one).\n\nThe studio also will release the movie slowly \u2014 despite its big stars and buzz, Oct. 18 will see a release in N.Y. and LA \u2014 before moving to other large cities and eventually middle America.\n\n\u201cJojo\u201d was acquired by Fox when it was still controlled by the Murdochs \u2014 Rupert Murdoch was made aware of the film and expressed concern behind the scenes but did not intervene, according to a person who was familiar with Murdoch\u2019s reaction but spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect confidential conversations.\n\nFox Searchlight executives have maintained they have full support from Disney executives and have touted an upcoming screening hosted by chief executive Robert Iger. But one source with knowledge of Disney executive discussions said the company has had executive-level meetings in recent months over potential fallout.\n\nAt Disney, the movie will not run into some of the political crosscurrents it might have under Murdoch, who also controls the conservative Fox News cable channel. But Disney, as a family-entertainment company, has long sought to stay above the political fray \u2014 a posture that will prove difficult here.\n\nIf there was any thought of shying away from politics, Waititi wasn\u2019t having it. Without addressing particular politicians or countries, the New Zealand-born filmmaker said 2019 has seen the same dangers as Germany faced at the time of the Nazis\u2019 rise.\n\n\u201cIn 1933 every week, one small change [would happen],\" he said. \"People would say 'that\u2019s wrong,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t big enough to get everyone up in arms. It wasn\u2019t big enough until it was too late.\n\n\u201cToday we say \u2018there are only 10 people over there, or 200 people over there,\u2019 \u201d he added, referring to proponents of racist sentiments. \u201cBut [that] is exactly what they said in 1933. The ignorance, and the arrogance to forget, is a big human flaw. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to tell these stories.\u201d", "description": "\"Jojo Rabbit,\" the talk of the Toronto International Film Festival, is a comedy about a boy whose imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler.", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S.", "September At Pm", "Steven Zeitchik Covers The Business Of Entertainment For The Washington Post", "Examining The Industry'S Trends", "Challenges", "Issues", "Ideas.
