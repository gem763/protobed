Even if it destroys itself again tomorrow?\" she asked. The man agreed.\n\nIn her new book, Fox shares several interactions like this, experiences that she hopes will help teach an important lesson.\n\n\"When I saw us domestically in this country begin to lose the ability to even listen to our friends and neighbors, let alone the people who are trying to kill us, it seemed that it would be valuable to share some of these interactions and let people take from my personal journey what they might have taken if they had had some of the same interactions themselves.\"\n\nShe told Insider that \"the greatest act of patriotism any of us can engage in right now is trying to find common ground and not allow our adversaries to weaken us from the inside out.\"\n\nThis is how she sees the US confronting the one threat that keeps her awake at night. As for the rest of the threats, her advice is to trust the professionals.\n\n\"I can't lie and say that they are not out there because they certainly are,\" Fox told Insider, revealing that most Americans \"would be overwhelmed\" if they really knew just how many threats were being tackled behind the scenes every day, but there are men and women working tirelessly in secret to protect this country and keep people safe from harm.", "description": "There are many existential threats, but the one that keeps this former CIA clandestine services officer awake at night is not what you might think.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da37c6acc4a0a64c16cd6e2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
