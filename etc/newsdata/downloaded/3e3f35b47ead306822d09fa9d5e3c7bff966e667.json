They don't want to go there.\n\nCritical to Trump's defense of himself -- up to and including a misleading campaign ad, and the president's attempts to malign and perhaps threaten the whistleblower -- is to focus scrutiny on former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOlivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Democratic 2020 contenders may not love the arrangement that saw Hunter Biden gain work from foreign entities while his father was vice president. But there's no sign of them turning on the Democratic front-runner.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, leave Joe Biden alone,\" Sen. Kamala Harris said over the weekend.\n\n\"I will be standing firmly in defense of Joe Biden throughout this process, because this in no way can besmirch his character, his honor, and his incredible service to this country,\" Sen. Cory Booker said on CNN Sunday.\n\nGOP defenses of Trump could run counter to public opinion. An ABC News/Ipsos poll out Sunday shows nearly two-thirds of Americans view Trump's ask of the Ukrainian president as a serious problem. Such among 9 in 10 Democrats -- and, perhaps more surprisingly, nearly a third of Republicans.\n\nThe president is playing the victim card. But Trump's strategy truly only works if he can victimize others -- something his rivals aren't inclined to allow.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nLate Friday night Trump signed a continuing resolution to keep the federal government open and funded until right before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe bipartisan deal averted a possible government shutdown this week.\n\nWith an impeachment inquiry now underway, the question now becomes whether Trump and Republicans will play ball again or risk grinding the government to a halt over pending investigations.\n\nErin Scott/Reuters\n\n\"If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,\" the president said during his February State of the Union address.\n\nDemocrats have sworn they can walk and chew gum at the same time: investigate and legislate, but that theory will be tested with real consequences very soon.\n\nThe TIP with Justin Gomez\n\nThe clock is ticking on Sen. Cory Booker's self-imposed deadline to fundraise $1.7 million in 10 days to cap off the end of the third quarter, which he says is required to continue his presidential campaign.\n\nCJ GUNTHER/EPA-EFE/REX\n\nThe latest figure released by Booker's campaign, late Sunday night, showed he was about $10,000 shy of his goal heading toward Monday night's midnight deadline.\n\nWhen the call for help originally was announced Sept. 21, the senator insisted this was not an \"end-of-quarter stunt\" and that the 10-day window would decide whether he had a \"path in this race.\"\n\nAnother confidence boost for Booker should he hit his fundraising target is the revelation he's made the donor threshold to qualify for the November Democratic presidential debate. The senator now just needs two more qualifying polls to make the stage.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast.
