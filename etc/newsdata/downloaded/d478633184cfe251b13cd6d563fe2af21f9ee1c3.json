A telling decision by Schiff, a capable former prosecutor: If you have an extortionate conversation, you quote it. If you need to imagine it into something it isn\u2019t, that means it is not an extortionate conversation.\n\nANDREW MCCARTHY: TRIANGULATING MANAFORT -- OBAMA, CLINTON AND UKRAINE\n\nAlso telling: Chairman Schiff came flying out of the starting block describing how overwhelmingly dependent Ukraine is on the United States and its president. Of course, this fact must be forced to the fore because it is not obvious from the Trump-Zelensky conversation \u2014 again, Schiff does not have evidence that Trump extorted Zelensky for the purpose of aiding Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut more to the point, the relationship of dependency intensified in 2015 due to the flight to Moscow of Ukraine\u2019s president, Viktor Yanukovych. At that point, a new Ukrainian government more to the Obama administration\u2019s liking, under President Petro Poroshenko, came to power.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe new government was desperate for American help, financially and security-wise, which is why Vice President Joe Biden was in a position to pressure it into firing the prosecutor who was conducting a corruption investigation of Burisma, the energy company that had appointed Hunter Biden to its board and was lavishly compensating him.\n\nIn \u201cBall of Collusion,\u201d I outline some of the extensive evidence that in 2016, the Obama administration\u2019s law enforcement agencies pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to revive a dormant corruption investigation of Paul Manafort.
