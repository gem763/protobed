He said that in a scenario in which 20 million people died in the U.S. as opposed to 150 million, the nation could then emerge as the stronger side and prevail in its objectives.\n\nHis argument was that with enough planning and civil defense measures, such as \u201ca certain layer of dirt and some reinforced construction materials,\u201d the effects of a nuclear war could be limited and that U.S. would be able to fairly quickly rebuild itself after an all-out conflict with the then-Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cIt may take 15 years, but geez, look how long it took Europe to recover after the Second World War,\u201d Kupperman said. Referring to the Japanese city on which the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb in 1945, he also claimed that \u201cHiroshima, after it was bombed, was back and operating three days later.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Kupperman was executive director of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament. He made the comments during an interview with Robert Scheer for the journalist\u2019s 1982 book, \u201cWith Enough Shovels: Reagan, Bush, and Nuclear War.\u201d\n\nThe National Security Council did not immediately respond to questions on whether Kupperman, 68, still holds the same views of nuclear conflict as he did in the early 1980s. Kupperman\u2019s seemingly cavalier attitude toward the potential death of millions of people was criticized at the time both by Democratic politicians and arms control experts.\n\n\u201cIt seems reasonable to suggest the crazies are in charge of the nukes,\u201d Jeremy Stone, president of the Federation of American Scientists, wrote about Kupperman and his colleagues in 1984.\n\nContemporary nuclear experts similarly criticize Kupperman\u2019s beliefs as wrongheaded and dangerous.\n\n\u201cKupperman\u2019s comments might as well have come straight from the script of (the film) \u2018Dr. Strangelove.\u2019 He was part of a group of defense analysts at the time who weren\u2019t shy about sharing such views,\u201d said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association, who first noted Kupperman\u2019s views in a Twitter post in January when Kupperman was hired as the deputy national security adviser.\n\n\u201cThe simple fact is that a nuclear war can\u2019t be won and must never be fought,\u201d Reif said.\n\n\"Kupperman's comments might as well have come straight from the script of 'Dr. Strangelove.'\"\n\nBut rather than being sidelined as a relic of Cold War hubris, Kupperman now holds one of the most powerful positions in the White House. Although his role is temporary, civil rights groups have also already called on him resign over his extensive ties to the Center for Security Policy, an anti-Muslim think tank founded by conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney.\n\nGaffney is a prominent anti-Muslim activist who repeatedly promoted the conspiracy theories that members of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration were working to enforce Islamic law in the U.S., that the Muslim Brotherhood had infiltrated top levels of government and that Obama was secretly Muslim himself. Kupperman served on the board of directors for Gaffney\u2019s Center for Security Policy between 2001-2010.\n\n\u201cCSP has continuously promoted Islamophobic conspiracy theories, and anyone, like Mr. Kupperman, who has so closely associated with them for so long is \u2015 at the very least \u2015 complicit in their brand of anti-Muslim bigotry and should not be entrusted with one of the highest-ranking security roles in the United States,\u201d Council on American-Islamic Relations Executive Director Nihad Awad said Tuesday.\n\nBefore joining the NSA, Kupperman served as an informal adviser to Bolton and worked as a defense industry executive at Boeing and Lockheed Martin. He was a critic of the Iranian nuclear deal and in 2017 co-signed a letter to Trump backing Bolton\u2019s plan to withdraw from the agreement.\n\nHere are excerpts of Kupperman\u2019s comments from his interview with Scheer:\n\nOn what kind of life we could visualize after a nuclear attack:\n\n\n\nIt means that, you know, it would be tough. It would be a struggle to reconstitute the society that we have. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be the same society [as] prior to an exchange, there is no question about that. But in terms of having an organized nation, and having enough means left after the war to reconstitute itself, I think that is entirely possible. It may take 15 years, but geez, look how long it took Europe to recover after the Second World War.\n\nOn disagreeing with the Physicians for Social Responsibility organization\u2019s view of nuclear war:\n\nScheer: But in terms of nuclear war, do you factor in what those doctors were saying?\n\nKupperman: Yes, that is why I want to have a civil defense system, because it can be very effective in reducing casualties. That is my point. If doctors are so concerned about it, the answer isn\u2019t necessarily disarming the United States or cutting our weapons programs. \u2026 it might be having a civil defense program. You can make a very good case that is exactly what those doctors ought to be shouting for.\n\nScheer: But they say that it is impossible to protect the population from nuclear attack.\n\nKupperman: Yes, but the thing is, nuclear weapons have certain effects and if you take steps to deny those effects, you save a lot of people. And unless you are right in the middle of ground zero, you are not going to have a lot of burn victims if you take those steps. And if you evacuate these people out of the targeted areas, or what you think are targeted areas, they are not going to get burned or destroyed.\n\nOn society surviving nuclear war:\n\nScheer: Is it possible to survive it with your civilization intact?\n\nKupperman: Well, it is possible to survive it with a certain amount of society intact, it depends on what steps we take to ensure that survivability. It certainly won\u2019t be the same as before the war. But generally societies have been intact \u2015 like Germany and Japan and Western Europe in the Second World War weren\u2019t the same after the war as they were before. But generally societies have been intact. The question really gets down to political credibility in the conduct of your foriegn policy. If you look like you are serious about defending yourself and your allies with real civil defense programs and other measures, I think that has political credibility with the adversary. An adversary isn\u2019t going to take somebody seriously if they don\u2019t take steps to protect themselves. Nuclear war is a destructive thing, but it is still in large part a physics problem.\n\nScheer: What do you mean?\n\nKupperman: Well, sheltering yourself against nuclear effects can be done, it just depends on how much effort and money one wants to spend on it, but a certain layer of dirt and some reinforced construction materials can assure the survivability of somebody, assuming they aren\u2019t at ground zero of a detonation. Hiroshima, after it was bombed, was back and operating three days later. So it is certainly a destructive weapon, and nobody wants a nuclear war, but I don\u2019t think the United States in the past has been serious enough about planning for its survival in the event of a nuclear war...\n\nOn winning nuclear war \u201cin a classical sense\u201d:\n\nKupperman: It depends on what one considers all-out. If the objective in a war is to try to destroy as many Soviet civilians and as many American civilians as is feasible, and the casualty levels approached 150 million on each side, then it\u2019s going to be tough to say you have a surviving nation after that. But depending on how the nuclear war is fought, it could mean the difference between 150 casualties and 20 million casualties. I think that is a significant difference, and if the country loses 20 million people, you may have a chance of surviving after that.\n\nScheer: Would that mean the other nation would survive as well? You\u2019re not talking about winning a nuclear war, you\u2019re talking about a stalemate of some kind.\n\nKupperman: It may or may not be a stalemate, depending on who had more surviving national power and military power.\n\nScheer: So you think it is possible to win?\n\nKupperman: I think it is possible to win, in the classical sense.\n\nScheer: What does that mean, \u201cin the classical sense\u201d?\n\nKupperman: It means that it is clear after the war that one side is stronger than the other side, the weaker side is going to accede to the demands of the stronger side.", "description": "Questioning \"mutual assured destruction,\" Charles Kupperman called nuclear conflict \"in large part a physics problem.\"", "authors": ["Senior World News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ba4e0230000e90352cc82.jpeg?cache=dghrczf94j&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
