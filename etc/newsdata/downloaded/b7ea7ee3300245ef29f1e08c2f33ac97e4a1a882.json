It's never nice to lose, especially in the manner that we're losing right now,\" Rabada, now the spearhead of the Proteas fast bowling unit in the absence of Steyn, said.\n\n\"We're going through a transition period at the moment in our team. It's fresh and it's young.\n\n\"The best thing we can do is look where we can improve but also remember our strengths as a team and build on that.\n\n\"It's been a huge learning curve so far, but we need to challenge ourselves to execute what we felt we have learnt.\"\n\nIt may be a transition period in the sense that there is a new coach at the helm in Enoch Nkwe, but the fact is that only Senuran Muthusamy and Anrich Nortje went into the second Test with less than 10 caps to their name.\n\nStill, Rabada is looking to stay optimistic.\n\n\"It makes me determined to improve. We've been put under immense pressure and I don't know if we can be put under any more pressure than that, so this pressure can hopefully produce something for us in the years to come,\" he said.\n\n\"It's about looking at the bigger picture as to where we're going as a team. Unfortunately, it hasn't started off well ... but we're constantly looking to improve.\n\n\"The guys are in that phase where they're learning about their games and playing international cricket in different conditions.\"\n\n2-0 down, South Africa have already lost the series heading into Saturday's third and final Test in Ranchi.\n\nSkipper Faf du Plessis has hinted at a couple of personnel changes, while there are still points in the ICC Test Championship to play for.\n\n\"We believe that we can win, and it would be great to back it up with a good performance before we leave. It would give us a lot of confidence knowing that we can win here,\" Rabada said.\n\n\"There is still the belief and that is what makes us a tight unit. It's just about implementing certain gameplans and skills so we can fire, but it is all invaluable experience.\n\n\"We know that we are representing the country and we are trying our best.\"", "description": "The Proteas have lost their last four Test matches - their worst run in the format since they lost five in a row in 2005/06.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7936/6621927384df4ab6987368ec77094a87.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
