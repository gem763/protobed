While observed instances of toddler behavior from the president have skyrocketed since August, his peak toddler output came in late August and early September 2018. It was when that op-ed landed at the same time as Bob Woodward\u2019s \u201cFear\u201d and Arizona U.S. Sen. John McCain\u2019s funeral.\n\nThis column, however, is not about Trump but about the Beltway reaction to this book. Anonymous\u2019s return has inspired a fair amount of derision within the chattering class. Axios reporter Jonathan Swan tweeted, \u201cIs this douchebag still quietly, oh so quietly, saving the republic? Spare us.\u201d Soledad O\u2019Brien wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t be an anonymous coward.\u201d You get the gist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis reaction is surprising to me. As the announcement noted, the author has taken no advance (the easiest and safest way for authors to make money) and intended to donate a large fraction of the royalties to nonprofit organizations. That is certainly more altruistic than most authors I know. As Politico\u2019s Jack Shafer noted Wednesday, an awful lot of folks in Washington talk to reporters under the cloak of anonymity. James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay published the Federalist Papers under the guise of \u201cPublius.\u201d This anonymous senior official is not even remotely in the league of the Founding Fathers, but Shafer is not wrong about how well that op-ed has aged:\n\nTime has been remarkably good to Anonymous\u2019 op-ed. When first published, it seemed vague, unnecessarily guarded and excessively self-congratulatory about its own courage. But read in the context of what we\u2019ve learned since about resistance by senior officials to President Donald Trump\u2019s orders, the op-ed seems a lot smarter. The op-ed boasted that the Trump administration was filled with many senior administration officials \u201cworking diligently from within to frustrate\u201d parts of Trump\u2019s \u201cagenda and his worst inclinations.\u201d A steady stream of news stories has appeared \u2014 and continues to appear almost daily \u2014 confirming the assertion of aggressive sandbagging of the president by top administration officials.\n\nSo why the blowback? I suspect because this announcement happened during the same moment that a number of civil service and political appointees have demonstrated far more courage than the anonymous senior official. The author of \u201cA Warning\u201d still has the cloak of anonymity. Current and former officials such as Laura Cooper, Fiona Hill, William Taylor, Marie Yovanovitch, Michael McKinley, George Kent and Philip Reeker defied the Trump White House and agreed to testify in front of the House impeachment inquiry. Unlike the author of \u201cA Warning,\u201d they don\u2019t have the luxury of thinking about lucrative book contracts; they are probably concerned about their mortgages and their legal fees. Nonetheless, they have all spoken truth to power in a far braver and riskier way than the op-ed writer.\n\nMany Trump officials have consoled themselves with leaking damaging tidbits and writing anonymous op-eds. But the people brave enough to follow rules and go on record\u2014Fiona Hill, Bill Taylor, the whistleblower who started it all\u2014are the one who actually protected this country. \u2014 Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) October 23, 2019\n\nThe contrast between these people and, say, Jim Mattis is also striking. Ever since he stepped down, the former defense secretary has been attempting to walk a tightrope between discretion and discussion about his time in the Trump administration, but with a strong bias toward the former. He has gotten even more closemouthed about Trump since plumping his book on Sunday morning talk shows. Despite many commentators begging him to start talking, he keeps acting like a retired military officer rather than a former civilian official. Even though former military officers are speaking out about Trump, the most Mattis can do is joke about him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLet\u2019s stipulate that those testifying as part of the House impeachment inquiry deserve praise for greater political bravery than Mattis or the anonymous official. And sure, I would love for Mattis or Rex Tillerson or H.R. McMaster or John Kelly to be more forthcoming about Trump\u2019s unfitness for office.\n\nBut perhaps we need to judge the political courage of these folks against a slightly different standard. Like, say, members of Congress.\n\nRecently, after the Trump White House announced the 2020 Group of Seven summit would be hosted at his Doral, Fla., resort but before Trump backed down, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) praised the announcement, saying, \u201cIt may seem careless politically, but on the other hand there\u2019s tremendous integrity in his boldness and his transparency.\u201d Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said, \u201cThere\u2019s no conflict of interest in holding anything in the great state of Florida.\u201d When Trump backed down, it was not because of these two clowns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen there are the GOP members of the House of Representatives.\n\nTried to ask Rep. Mo Brooks about Taylor testifying that he had been told Trump wanted probes announced before releasing aid and he erupted over the question. \"The opening statement doesn't make any difference!\" he said. Asked about the substance, \"it doesn't make any difference\" pic.twitter.com/1O7KXkvClE \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) October 23, 2019\n\n.@Jim_Jordan defends Trump calling the impeachment inquiry a \"lynching\": \"The president's frustrated.\" pic.twitter.com/MZ9oCoPJnp \u2014 Oliver Willis (@owillis) October 22, 2019\n\nThis is an awfully long way from John F. Kennedy writing, \u201cWhen party and officeholder differ as to how the national interest is to be served, we must place first the responsibility we owe not to our party or even to our constituents, but to our individual consciences.\"\n\nIn a party filled with toadies and sycophants, any form of backbone or dissent from \u201cthe genius of our great President\u201d mantra should be welcomed by critics of this administration. In normal times, I would want former chief of staff John Kelly to flatly state that Trump is unfit for office. In these times, well, I can live with Kelly telling the Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker, \u201cSomeone has got to be a guide that tells [Trump] that you either have the authority or you don\u2019t, or Mr. President, don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t hire someone that will just nod and say, \u2018That\u2019s a great idea Mr. President.\u2019 Because you will be impeached.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWatergate did not end Richard Nixon because Deep Throat came forward out of the goodness of his heart. It happened in part because Mark Felt was hoping to use the scandal to advance his own career. One can praise the political courage of people including Yovanovitch or Cooper without rejecting what anonymous officials have to say in books. In a world in which GOP members of Congress are terrified of the base, even mild forms of dissent from the party line should be encouraged.\n\nAD", "description": "Are we defining political courage down?", "authors": ["Daniel W.
