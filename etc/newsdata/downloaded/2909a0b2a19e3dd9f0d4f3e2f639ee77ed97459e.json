Testamentary trust arrangements can provide tax advantages to beneficiaries.\n\nFirst announced in the 2018-19 budget, the changes will apply from July 1 this year.\n\nCurrently, income received by minors from testamentary trusts is taxed at normal adult rates, rather than the higher tax rates which generally apply to people under 18.\n\n'Small gain'\n\nBut Treasury says \"some taxpayers are able to inappropriately obtain the benefit of this lower tax rate by injecting assets unrelated to the deceased estate into the testamentary trust\".\n\nThe planned changes will tax minors at adult marginal rates only in respect of income a testamentary trust generates from assets of the deceased estate, or the proceeds of the disposal or investment of these assets.\n\nIf successful, the rule change will have \"a small unquantifiable gain\" to the budget bottom line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Molesworth said the draft legislation's requirement that a minor beneficiary be part of the defined class at the time of the will maker's death is problematic because it was not part of the original budget announcement.\n\n\"The proposed legislation has retrospective application because it potentially affects amendments to deeds already made.\"\n\nUndermining the tax system\n\nHe said rules allowing for the appointment of further beneficiaries, or classes of beneficiaries, were also problematic.\n\n\"The testator may have relied on this power and the discretion of his or her trustees to \u2018do right\u2019, rather than trying to imagine every potential class of beneficiaries that he or she may want to benefit under the testamentary trust.\n\n\"The legislation assumes that the terms of the testamentary trust are thought about and set by the testator immediately before death and with the benefit of full knowledge. This is not always the case.\"\n\nHe said repeated references to the Tax Commissioner's opinion undermined the self-assessed nature of the tax system.\n\n\u201cQuite clearly, it is positively harmful to efficient compliance with, and administration of, the law where the satisfaction of the commissioner\u2019s opinion becomes the touch point for challenge, rather than objectively observable facts,\" Mr Molesworth said.", "description": "The Morrison government is going ahead with changes to stop people stuffing assets into a trust after someone dies to take advantage of lower tax rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_13/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b33b8c706f987858b65dfccd3559f999b1701ffc", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
