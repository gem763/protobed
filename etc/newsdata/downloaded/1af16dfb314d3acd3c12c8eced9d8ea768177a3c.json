The U.S and China have reached a truce in their trade dispute, but have yet to resolve their disagreements. \"U.S monetary policy can not reasonably react to the day-to-day give and take of trade negotiations,\" he said.\n\nMr. Bullard voted for a larger rate cut than the majority of his fellow policy makers when the Fed eased policy in September. He said the central bank could reverse course if the U.S. economy avoided a sharper slowdown.\n\n\"We can take back that insurance in 2020 and 2021,\" he said.\n\nWrite to Paul Hannon at Paul.Hannon@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 15, 2019 05:19 ET (09:19 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
