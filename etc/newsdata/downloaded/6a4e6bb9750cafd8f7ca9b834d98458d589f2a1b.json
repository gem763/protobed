Houston hosts the Washington Nationals in Game 1 of the World Series at 8 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe Astros used stellar defense and an early home run to take control of the game at Minute Maid Park in Houston. Yankees first baseman D.J. LeMahieu tied the score at 4-4 in the top of the ninth frame before Altuve gave the Astros a 6-4 victory with a 406-foot bomb to left field.\n\n\u201cIn the at-bat, I just wanted to get a good pitch to hit,\u201d Altuve told Fox Sports. \u201cI wanted to be on time for the fastball but I was looking for something I could hit.\n\n\u201cIt just happened.\u201d\n\nGO CRAZY, HOUSTON!!! pic.twitter.com/QCOSDExsSV\u2014 FOX Sports (@FOXSports) October 20, 2019\n\nAstros first baseman Yuli Gurriel hit a 3-run homer in the first inning and Houston held onto the lead until the final frame.\n\nThe Yankees answered Gurriel\u2019s homer with Gary Sanchez ripping an RBI double to score Didi Gregorius in the top of the second inning. Gio Urshela blasted a 395-foot solo shot off Astros reliever Jose Urquidy in the top of the fourth frame to make the score 3-2.\n\nAstros right fielder Josh Reddick made a spectacular diving catch to prevent a game-tying run in the top of the sixth inning. Astros star Alex Bregman grounded into a force out in the bottom of the inning, but Altuve scored on the play, pushing Houston\u2019s lead to two runs.\n\nAstros left fielder Michael Brantley provided another defensive gem in the top of the seventh inning. Yankees center fielder Aaron Hicks hit a ball to left field on the play. The ball looked like it was about to drop in front of Hicks, but the Astros outfielder dove to catch it before throwing to first base for an inning-ending double play.\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME! MICHAEL BRANTLEY!\n\nOne of the best defensive plays you will ever see! pic.twitter.com/YeBKjQnplH\u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 20, 2019\n\nAstros reliever Roberto Osuna allowed LeMahieu\u2019s game-tying blast in the top of the ninth frame.\n\nChapman entered the game for the Yankees in the bottom of the final inning. He struck out Martin Maldonado in his first exchange before forcing Reddick to pop out. Chapman walked George Springer before settling in against Altuve.\n\nThe Astros star worked for a 2-0 lead in the count before Chapman threw a slider for a strike. Chapman tossed in another slider for his fourth offering of the exchange. Altuve smacked the offering over the right field fence, prompting the crowd to erupt, and winning the game for Houston.\n\n\u201cI get asked to describe Jose Altuve all the time,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cMVP is what he is.\u201d\n\nAltuve went 2 for 4 with two RBIs, three runs scored and a walk in the win. Starting pitcher Brad Peacock allowed two hits and one run in 1.2 innings for Houston. Yankees starter Chad Green allowed two hits and three runs in one inning of work.\n\nGurriel went 2 for 4 with three RBIs and a run scored. Urshela went 3 for 3 with an RBI, a walk and a run scored in the loss. Gregorius was 2 for 4 for the Yankees.\n\nThe Astros are looking to win their second World Series title in three years. The Boston Red Sox beat the Astros in the 2018 ALCS and went on to win the World Series. Houston beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games during their 2017 World Series run.\n\nThe Nationals swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS to reach the World Series for the first time in franchise history.", "description": "Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 Jose Altuve belted a two-run homer off New York Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman in the ninth inning of Game 6 of the American League", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
