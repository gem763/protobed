It says it is committed to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement and denies meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs.\n\nChina is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by its obligations under the 1984 declaration.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Declaration is a legally binding treaty between the UK and China that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed and ratified over 30 years ago,\u201d a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in June.\n\n\u201cAs a co-signatory, the UK government will continue to defend our position.\u201d\n\nBut there is little London can do to force Beijing\u2019s hand, pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with the world\u2019s second-largest economy after Britain leaves the European Union as planned at the end of next month.", "description": "Hong Kong pro-democracy activists plan sit-ins at shopping malls on Saturday after a night in which protesters took to the hills to form lantern-carrying human chains, the latest demonstrations in months of unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429626908&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8D00E", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
