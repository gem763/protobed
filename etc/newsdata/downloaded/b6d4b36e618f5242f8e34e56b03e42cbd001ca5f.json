The hotline is expected to go live on Friday.\n\nSources say the decision for the firm to hugely expand its Brexit team has to be kept secret for \u201cpolitical reasons\u201d.\n\nOne said: \u201cThe workers have been told it is top secret \u2013 but it\u2019s chaos. No one knows what happens, and the new recruits are totally unprepared to deal with something so complex.\n\n\u201cThe first few weeks of \u2018training\u2019 consisted of them sending out crosswords and word searches with Brexit-related words in them.\n\n\u201cThen new starters were given scenarios pretending to be from a customer and everyone was meant to reply saying how they\u2019d respond.\n\n\u201cBut how can they advise on complex business issues when we don\u2019t know how our relationship with the EU will look? It\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\nA Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: \u201cGetting businesses ready for Brexit is our top priority. Leaving the EU presents British business with an historic opportunity and we will work together to forge an outward looking, free trading, entrepreneurial and creative United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe whole of government has stepped up a gear and increased the pace of our preparations as we get ready to leave on 31 October, implementing the democratic mandate of the British people.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Up to 250 short term workers are being recruited to answer queries from small businesses about the impact of leaving the EU", "authors": ["Dan Warburton", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20655511.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-650855505.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
