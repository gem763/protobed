The woman, Sonia Ng, said she was assaulted in a darkened body-search room at a detention center near the mainland Chinese border on Aug. 31 and wasn\u2019t the only one who \u201csuffered sexual violence.\u201d\n\nNg removed the face mask she was wearing in front of a crowd of more than 1,000 people and challenged university administrators present to take a stand against police violence.\n\nSpeaking later on a radio show, Ng added that she received threats by phone from people with mainland numbers and had her personal information made public on the internet after sharing her story, Radio Television Hong Kong reported. She also clarified that the alleged abuse took place at the Kwai Chung Police Station about 35 kilometers (22 miles) away, it said.\n\nThe Hong Kong Police Force said in a statement that they hadn\u2019t received a formal complaint and vowed to \u201cproactively\u201d seek Ng\u2019s account to investigate. The police \u201caccord high priority to such a serious allegation,\u201d the force said on its Facebook page.\n\nPolice and protesters have repeatedly accused each other of abuses over weeks of tense clashes in the former British colony, with human rights group Amnesty International last month saying authorities used \u201cunnecessary and excessive force\u201d amounting to \u201ctorture.\u201d While Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has promised to investigate any claims of police misconduct, she has so far resisted demands for an independent commission of inquiry.\n\nHong Kong Protesters Debate Halt to Vandalism Ahead of Weekend\n\nNg said she was arrested at Prince Edward Station in the city\u2019s Kowloon district during one of the most controversial episodes of the four-month-old protest movement. Riot police raided the station after scuffles between protesters and other passengers.\n\nSubsequent accusations of police violence and official cover-ups have fueled weeks of vigils and rallies at the station and helped inspire widespread vandalism of properties owned by rail operator MTR Corp.\n\n\u201cDo you know when we got beaten up, the MTR staff looked at us and didn\u2019t do anything?\u201d Ng said. \u201cI like CUHK. I wish this home can give us true care and protect us.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Iain Marlow in Hong Kong at imarlow1@bloomberg.net;Fion Li in Hong Kong at fli59@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Daniel Ten Kate\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong police pledged to investigate a protester\u2019s allegation that she was sexually assaulted by officers, after she dramatically shared her story at a university event.Police responded after the student aired the claim Thursday at a town hall-style event at Chinese University of Hong", "authors": ["Iain Marlow", "Fion Li"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
