She said she\u2019s starting a full-time music career.\n\nSpeaking to RT\u2019s video agency Ruptly after her performance at the opening of the New Little Italy district in Los Angeles, the Russian-born Zamourka said she felt \u201clike never before in her entire life.\u201d She sang an aria from Italian opera composer Giacomo Puccini.\n\nI feel this is... my chance of teaching people the real me, who I was the whole time.\n\nIt all started with a tweet of Los Angeles Police Department that launched the miraculous transformation of Zamourka\u2019s life from a homeless woman sleeping on the cardboard to a celebrity with an offer of a recording contract from Grammy-nominated producer. LAPD posted a video of Zamourka singing on the platform of Koreatown metro station, taken by one of the officers. More than 1.1 million of people watched her performance \u2013 and many were impressed by her singing skills.\n\n4 million people call LA home. 4 million stories. 4 million voices...sometimes you just have to stop and listen to one, to hear something beautiful. pic.twitter.com/VzlmA0c6jX \u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) 27 September 2019\n\nBut before reaching this high point in her life, Zamourka did experience quite a few lows. Her prized $10,000 violin was grabbed and destroyed by a man after a street performance in 2016, depriving the woman of her main source of income. Someone then pushed her off a bus, causing her to fracture her wrist, and ending her playing career for good. She also suffered severe health problems, and was eventually unable to pay her rent.\n\nI don\u2019t deserve all those bad things that people did to me, I\u2019ve never done anything bad to anybody, all I wanted was to touch people\u2019s spirits with my music.\n\nAnd touch the spirits she did, with hundreds of fans now donating to Emily via GoFundMe to help her out of her situation, with more than $67,000 raised since Tuesday.Emily is very thankful. The vocalist burst into tears, describing how hopeful she had previously been that some of the videos of her singing taken by passers-by would attract attention.\n\nPeople recorded me a lot but I\u2019ve never seen it. So I guess now they get to be revealed and it just touches me because... I just went back to how I was, and I want to go back to how it was, and this is going to help me.\n\nZamourka said she wanted to become a \u201cworking artist\u201d and it was something \u201cshe is already doing today.\u201d Music producer Joel Diamond, who made her a contract offer, earlier said that he\u2019s already recorded some tracks, which feature \u201ca classical crossover with EDM.\u201d An album titled Paradise is now in the works.\n\nEmily Zamourka was born in Russia, where she learned classical singing and the violin. She emigrated to the United States in 1992. Zamourka gave piano and violin classes to make a living until her health deteriorated. Friends from Russia and the US helped her get by, but after one American who aided with her bills died of a heart attack, she was left all on her own.\n\nWATCH FULL INTERVIEW WITH EMILY ZAMOURKA:\n\nLike this story?
