It lowers to 1,000 euros from 3,000 the threshold above which it is illegal to make cash transactions.\n\nIn addition, the government plans to set a lower rate of value-added tax for purchases made by card rather than cash.\n\nTo encourage people to ask retailers for receipts, the budget also launches lotteries in which holders of the winning receipts, identified with a number, get a tax-free cash prize.\n\nThese \"receipt lotteries\" have already been adopted in several countries including Portugal, Slovakia and Malta.\n\nA new \"web-tax\" on digital companies aims to raise around 600 million euros each year, the draft showed.\n\nThe levy, applied on companies with annual global revenues worth at least 750 million euros and digital services exceeding 5.5 million euros in Italy, obliges them to pay a 3% levy on internet transactions conducted in Italy.", "description": "Italy readies 2020 budget that cuts taxes, cracks down on evaders", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
