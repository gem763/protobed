If the teams and the league can\u2019t reach an agreement on the date, it will be up to the federation to make the final decision.\n\nThe match is likely to be played in December, before the winter break. The league has proposed moving the game to Dec. 7, a Saturday, which would mean the teams\u2019 matches, which had already been scheduled for that weekend, would have to be moved.\n\nThere was also the possibility of playing it on Dec. 18, a Wednesday, but then Copa del Rey matches would have to be rescheduled. In addition, the league doesn\u2019t want the game to be played midweek because it would potentially hurt television rights holders. The Oct. 26 match was scheduled for a 1 p.m. kickoff local time, which favors the important Asian market.\n\nThe league runs the top two tiers of Spanish soccer, while the federation controls regulations and fixtures for professional and amateur games.\n\nBarcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said earlier Thursday he and his players preferred to keep the schedule unchanged and show everyone that the game could take place safely despite the current problems in Catalonia.\n\nThe region has seen violent protests for the last few days with police clashing with protesters angered by a Supreme Court decision to sentence nine separatist leaders to prison. Separatist groups have called for supporters to rally in Barcelona on the day of the match.\n\nCatalan independence flags are a regular feature at Barcelona\u2019s home games at the Camp Nou Stadium.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "This month's Spanish league \"cl\u00e1sico\" match between Barcelona and Real Madrid is expected to be postponed until December because of a planned separatist rally in the Catalan capital.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tales Azzoni"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/spain_soccer_la_liga_30686_c0-146-3500-2187_s1200x700.jpg?50e117847fba66c2d01efa712c1454d317fcd0c6", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
