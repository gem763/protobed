Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nThe chairmen had previously sent two letters requesting the documents from Pompeo, and he complied with neither.\n\nThe letter caps a tumultuous week in Washington which saw the Trump administration release a memorandum summarizing the call between Mr. Trump and Zelensky. The call was a subject of a whistleblower complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community and had initially been withheld from Congress by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. The complaint was released on Thursday, shortly before Maguire testified to the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe summary, which was not a verbatim transcript, showed that the president urged Zelensky to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate the aspects of the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, as well as \"the other thing\" \u2014 Biden's efforts in 2016 to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor widely seen by the West as corrupt.\n\nMr. Trump and Giuliani have alleged Biden acted to remove the prosecutor to protect his son, Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that had been under investigation. The whistleblower's complaint noted Giuliani's outreach to Ukrainian officials on this topic, citing information from press reports.\n\nGiuliani told Fox News' Laura Ingraham that he didn't act on his own \u2014 \"I went to meet Mr. Zelinsky's aide at the request of the State Department. Fifteen memos make that clear.\"\n\nThe chairmen also sent a separate letter to Pompeo notifying him that the committees had scheduled depositions for former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, and U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland \u2014 all of whom were mentioned in the whistleblower complaint.", "description": "The subpoena comes after the acting director of national intelligence testified before Congress earlier this week about the whistleblower complaint involving President Trump", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/b42c583c-037a-4d2d-9b66-657ac29de2b4/thumbnail/1200x630/01ce94f7a55b3b0854a3744fab19f664/gettyimages-1135802477.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
