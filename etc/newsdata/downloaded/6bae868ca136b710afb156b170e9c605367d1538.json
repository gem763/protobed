I\u2019m two feet away,\u201d Navarro fired back, causing the audience to let out a loud \u201cOooo!\u201d\n\nMcCain, naturally, grumbled while she shot Navarro a death glare as liberal co-host Joy Behar quickly handed it off to a commercial break.\n\nMeanwhile, as the camera panned out while the show\u2019s announcer hyped the upcoming segments, McCain could be seen abruptly leaving the table and storming off backstage.", "description": "\u201cExcuse me, maybe I was clumsy in the way that I said it!\u201d the conservative co-host exclaimed after frustrating her colleagues with an incoherent argument.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568994631/navarro-mccain_ozrnqw", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
