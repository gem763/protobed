So nice to see!\u201d\n\nMr Trump's favourite TV network, Fox News, was forced to apologise to the teenager after one of its guests suggested she was mentally unwell. And on Friday Bernard Arnault, the richest man in Europe, claimed the 16-year-old's efforts were \"demoralising\" for young people.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

We should also take that as a compliment.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish climate activist did not address Mr Trump by name but told protesters she did not \u201dunderstand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s just incredible to be united in such a way for a common cause. It just feels great, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nGreta was joined in Montreal by aboriginal Canadians, a group she described as \u201coften the ones who are at the front line\u201d of global warming.\n\nShe also met with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian leader, privately for around 15 minutes. \u201cHe is of course obviously not doing enough but... this is such a huge problem,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy message to all the politicians is the same, to just listen to the science, act on the science.\u201d\n\nGreta began her activism a year ago, by protesting alone outside the Swedish parliament. Her campaign has since galvanised thousands of schoolchildren to take part in protests demanding action to save the environment.\n\nStudents conducted a second wave of global protests on Friday, with tens of thousands taking to the streets in New Zealand.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Greta Thunberg\u00a0has marched alongside an estimated 500,000 people\u00a0at a global climate strike\u00a0demonstration\u00a0in\u00a0Montreal, telling protesters\u00a0she did\u00a0not understand why adults mock children for campaigning against global warming.", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/23/greta-thunberg-montreal-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
