In democracy, we supposedly have the power. But in Chinatown, there\u2019s nothing you can do. Forget it, Jake. It\u2019s an oligarchy.\n\nIs the impeachment inquiry the false hope, the cocky detective?\n\nThis was the week that made it glaringly clear that the president put his fragile ego, idiotic conspiracy theories and political prospects ahead of American national security interests. But watching Mike Pence and Marco Rubio and the red firewall of Republican lawmakers pervert principles to protect Donald Trump elicits dread that there will be more lawlessness.\n\nAs John Huston\u2019s Noah Cross says when Jake confronts him over his turpitude: \u201cMost people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place they are capable of \u2026 anything.\u201d\n\nIn this desolate scenario, is Nancy Pelosi Jake?\n\nNot really. The speaker is anything but na\u00efve. She is well aware that Mitch McConnell \u2014 an icy film noir villain if there ever was one \u2014 will snuff out any threat that Trump will be ousted. (And don\u2019t forget, as the House demands documents from the vice president in the impeachment inquiry, if Trump and Pence have to go, we\u2019ll have our first Madam President.)\n\nTrump biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio predicted that being in the White House would distill Trump to his essence. And his essence, D\u2019Antonio says, is a dark swirl of cruelty, violence and fear. That is on disturbing display in \u201cBorder Wars: Inside Trump\u2019s Assault on Immigration,\u201d the new book by Times reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.\n\n\u201cPrivately,\u201d they wrote in an adaptation of the book in The Times, \u201cthe president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him.\u201d\n\nThe sordid moment where we find ourselves is at once stunning and ineluctable: the House move to impeachment, Trump\u2019s lunatic denials about his blatant transgressions, and his even more lunatic bouts of self-incrimination.", "description": "Donald Trump drags us down to Chinatown.", "authors": ["Maureen Dowd"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/opinion/06Dowd1/06Dowd1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
