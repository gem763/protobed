I also asked Cruise Critic editor in chief Colleen McDaniel and Emerson Hankamer, CEO of Houston-based Vacations To Go, one of the largest sellers of ocean cruises, for their advice on finding deals. Here are our suggestions.\n\nWait until the last minute . . . Most cruise lines have cancellation policies allowing for some sort of refund up to 90 days before departure. That\u2019s why the biggest discounts usually appear in that three-months-to-sailing window. \u201cCruise lines use a book-to-fill model, meaning they want to fill 100 percent of cabins for each voyage to maximize their profit,\u201d Hankamer says. \u201cSince they want to sell out the ship, they offer markdowns on any available cabins.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEight rewards card pitches that travelers should ignore\n\nWhile you may get a great price, booking last minute may limit your choice of cabin category or location, as well as shipboard restaurant reservations and popular shore excursions. To find the latest cruise deals, you can check the 90-Day Ticker at Vacations To Go or sign up for Cruise Critic\u2019s Price Alerts and receive notifications by email when prices drop or increase on specific sailings, itineraries, destinations and cruise lines.\n\n. . . Or be an early bird. If you know exactly which ship, cabin type and location, when you want to sail, and the itinerary, however, you can often get a good deal by booking as soon as an itinerary is announced \u2014 typically 18 to 24 months in advance, according to McDaniel. While the cruise lines may not discount the cabin per se, they reward early bookers with add-on incentives such as free or discounted airfare, beverage packages, prepaid gratuities and onboard credits, which can save you hundreds of dollars. Early birds may also be rewarded with the chance to bid for stateroom upgrades; programs include Celebrity Cruises MoveUp, Norwegian Upgrade Advantage, Azamara Upgrade and Royal Caribbean RoyalUp.\n\nConsider repositioning. Ships don\u2019t stay in the same place year-round and must be repositioned for maximum service. The Mediterranean is not smooth sailing come winter, and Alaska\u2019s ports of call essentially shutter from October to early May. That means many ships may deploy to the Caribbean or look to ports in Southeast Asia such as Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam in the winter. As I mentioned before, cruise lines hate sailing empty, so a trip from Barcelona to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, or from Seattle to Miami is priced aggressively to sell.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring our interview, Hankamer found a 14-night transatlantic trip from Barcelona to Rio de Janeiro on the luxury brand Oceania Cruises for $1,899 per person and in recent years has seen cruise fares as low as $75 per night per passenger.\n\nRepositioning cruises have trade-offs. On the plus side, you may experience some unique ports of call, transit the Panama Canal, or have more time for in-depth workshops and onboard lectures themed around topics of interest such as cooking, world affairs or photography. In the minus column: Depending on the route, you may have numerous days at sea, cross large expanses of open, sometimes rough water and have to deal with the extra cost of an \u201copen-jaw\u201d airline ticket \u2014 where the origin and destination are not the same in both directions.\n\nLook to shoulder seasons. If I could predict the weather, I would have become a meteorologist instead of a journalist. Cruise lines aren\u2019t any more accurate in long-range forecasting than the rest of us. So while they schedule Alaska sailings in May and September, they also know many passengers worry it will be too cold. Those willing to take a chance that the weather gods will look kindly upon them \u2014 and I know hardy people who have trekked across glaciers in May wearing shorts and a T-shirt \u2014 will probably find extra discounts. In fact, the savings may be as much as 75 percent off regular fares, plus value-added amenities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFirst time taking a cruise? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nThe same holds true for sailing the Mediterranean in April, May and September. Plus, McDaniel says, any time kids are in school is a good time to sail, because you will probably have a more adult experience and family-oriented cruise lines are more likely to have extra cabins they need to fill.\n\nBe willing to take a risk. One of the best times to find an affordable cruise is during hurricane season \u2014 from late May to late October in the Caribbean. \u201cI often cruise during hurricane season and have never had a trip disrupted,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cThe great thing about cruise ships is that they can change course and move away from storms. So worst case is you may see different ports than originally planned.\u201d She notes that while the odds are in your favor, you should buy travel insurance just in case.\n\nFind an experienced travel agent. A good one will take the time to understand your needs and match you to the right cruise. They may also have access to deals not found on cruise line websites or widely publicized and will give you notice of sales or deals when they see a price drop. In fact, cruise lines often rely on partners such as travel agencies to let customers know about last-minute deals, Hankamer explains.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShop warehouse stores. Cruising doesn\u2019t exactly come to mind when traversing the aisles of your local Costco or BJ\u2019s Wholesale, but members of these warehouse stores reap big rewards. For instance, book through Costco and you may receive a shipboard credit. If you don\u2019t spend it all on board, let the cruise ship\u2019s reception desk know, and Costco will issue a refund to your credit card for the unused amount. Or, in lieu of the onboard credit, Costco may offer a rebate in the form of a Costco Cash Card received after your cruise is over. In addition, executive members earn an annual 2 percent reward on Costco Travel purchases, including cruises. Members of BJ\u2019s Wholesale who book a qualifying cruise may receive a BJ\u2019s gift card up to $500 and/or onboard spending credits.\n\nLook into every possible discount. There are other options for obtaining a deal. Being loyal to a specific cruise line can net you some savings; repeat passengers typically get a small discount on a future cruise. McDaniel also reminds travelers they may able to use points or miles accrued through credit cards toward a cruise. Hankamer says you may also find discounts based on age (55-plus) or profession, such as first responder, military officer or teacher. Also home in on the base price of the cruise. Your price may bundle in a drink package, airfare or shore excursions. Often the cruise line will reduce the fare by subtracting the add-ons you don\u2019t plan to use.\n\nMcDaniel puts it best when she reminds cruisers, \u201cYou need to understand the difference between a good value versus a great deal. If the ship isn\u2019t a fit, then no matter how little you paid, it\u2019s not a deal. But if you are happy with the price you paid and have an experience that blows your mind, then that\u2019s the best deal of all.\u201d\n\nDaily is a consumer writer based in Colorado.
