We think that\u2019s good, not because \u2014 we like the Iranian people to thrive \u2014 we don\u2019t have a conflict with the Iranian people.\u201d\n\nDayan added that \u201cthe significance of that [is] Iran has less recourse to give to the proxy terrorists they support, to promote terrorism all over the world, to promote instability all over the world, to supply arms to Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\nIn that context \u201cit\u2019s a very clever policy of the United States. Sanctions work. Sanctions against Iran work,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cAnd as crippling as they are, they\u2019re more important.\u201d\n\nA Saudi military officer walks by what was described asa the remains of Iranian cruise missiles and drones used in an attack this weekend that targeted the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry, during a press conference by military spokesman Col. Turki al-Malki in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019. Though Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed the assault, the U.S. alleges Iran was behind it. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil) More\n\nDayan wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call for military intervention in Israel, but he added that \u201cIran is a threat to the stability of the world\u201d \u2014 including the U.S. and Israel.\n\nTehran has denied involvement in the drone attack on Saudi Arabia, but reports emerged that debris found implicate Iran, which backs Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels that have claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDayan said that even if Iran didn\u2019t \u201cpush the button\u201d themselves, Houthi rebels are a \u201cproxy of Iran. They do nothing without Iran\u2019s knowhow. They do nothing without Iran\u2019s consent. Exactly like Hezbollah in our Northern border.\u201d\n\nTypically, Israel hasn\u2019t commented on strikes made against Iran, however it has been reported that Israel has attacked Iran-backed sites in Syria.\n\nIn one publicly confirmed offensive, Israel says it struck sites in Syria to prevent Iran \u201cusing killer drones.\u201d\n\nKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
