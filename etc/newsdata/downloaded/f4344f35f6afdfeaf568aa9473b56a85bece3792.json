I'm sure you want what's best for her. Please return Isabel to a safe location or contact us and let us know how we can help you reunite her with her family.\"\n\nLynch is an ex-boyfriend of Hicks' mother, ABC Richmond affiliate WRIC reported, citing family members.\n\nAuthorities said Monday that Lynch is known to the teen but did not discuss their relationship.\n\nThere is no evidence the 14-year-old was taken forcefully, authorities said; however, Lynch is believed to have a handgun and is considered dangerous.\n\nHicks' brother, Blake, told reporters last week, \"We want you to come home. Please just let us know you are safe however you can.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m still your big brother and I\u2019ll love you forever. I just need my best friend back,\" he said.\n\nSheriff's officials have asked the public to be on the lookout for Hicks, Lynch and this 2003 Toyota Matrix. The rear passenger side door handle is missing, authorities said.\n\nFBI\n\nLynch is described as having brown hair and brown eyes, standing at 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighing 195 pounds. He has cross tattoos on both upper arms and has a tattoo that says \"Bruce\" on the top of his back.\n\nLynch left with camping gear; authorities suspect the two may be staying in wooded areas.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Richmond Division of the FBI at 804-261-1044.\n\nABC News' Amanda Maile contributed to this report.", "description": "Isabel Shae Hicks, 14, was last seen in the early hours of Oct. 21.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/hicks-ht-er-191024_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
