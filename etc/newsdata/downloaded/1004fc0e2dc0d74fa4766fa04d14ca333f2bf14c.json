Virtually all of them rely on Vincristine to battle their illnesses.\n\nVincristine is used in children's chemotherapy treatments for diseases like leukemias, brain tumors, and lymphomas\n\nPfizer and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries were the only drug manufacturers who supplied Vincristine until 2019. Teva made a 'business decision to discontinue the drug' in July\n\nDemand for the drug has created a back log on the medicine that Pfizer is struggling to fill.\n\n'Pfizer has experienced a delay, and we are working closely with them and exploring all options to make sure this critical cancer drug is available for the patients who need it,' the F.D.A. said in a brief statement to the New York Times.\n\nPfizer spokeswoman Jessica Smith said the company will rush additional Vincristine shipments over the next few weeks to 'support three to four times our typical production output,' to try picking up the workload created by Teva's pullout.\n\nAs it stands, the situation has created a 'nightmare' scenario for cancer doctors who are now being forced to weigh difficult choices that will probably affect juvenile patients.\n\nVincristine is used in children's chemotheraphy treatments. It works by stopping fast-dividing cancer cells from growing by blocking each of them from assembling its 'skeleton,' when it attempts to multiply\n\nDemand for the drug has created a back log on the medicine that Pfizer is struggling to fill\n\n'This is truly a nightmare situation,' Dr. Yoram Unguru, a pediatric oncologist at the Herman and Walter Samuelson Children's Hospital at Sinai in Baltimore, told the New York Times.\n\n'Vincristine is our water. It's our bread and butter. I can't think of a disease in childhood cancer that doesn't use Vincristine,' she added. 'There is no substitution for Vincristine that can be recommended. You either have to skip a dose or give a lower dose \u2014 or beg, borrow or plead.'\n\nVincristine is just the latest drug of which doctors are experiencing a 'critical shortage,' according to Forbes.\n\nEight out of the 10 drugs typically used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia - the most common childhood cancer accounting for nearly 25 percent of all juvenile forms of the disease - have been unavailable at times during the past 10 years.\n\nDr. Yoram Unguru, a pediatric oncologist at the Herman and Walter Samuelson Children\u2019s Hospital at Sinai in Baltimore, has been warning of the 'health care crisis' posed by drug shortages for several years.\n\n'The government needs to take a position. They already do with companies to guarantee water, electricity \u2013 why not these essential drugs?' Unguru told Cancer Therapy Advisor. 'These medicines are truly part of our critical infrastructure and we need to treat them as such...\n\n'It\u2019s hard enough for any family having a kid with cancer,' Unguru told the New York Times, 'and having a child with cancer likely to be cured, except we can\u2019t give them the drug, is beyond the imagination. How can we do that to families?'", "description": "The recent scarcity of\u00a0Vincristine in the U.S. has created, 'a nightmare situation' for U.S. doctors who use it to treat all kinds of childhood cancers.
