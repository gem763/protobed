(Picture: NBC)\n\nA 12-year-old boy was suspended from school for physical assault \u2013 all because he hugged his gym teacher.\n\nThe incident that originally earned the student a ten-day suspension and a record for assaulting a teacher occurred at Forest Grove Middle School in Worcester, Massachusetts last month.\n\nThe boy\u2019s foster mother, Julie Orozco, said her foster son left a \u2018difficult home situation\u2019 in March and has since worked hard to get good grades and have perfect attendance. Now she fears the situation will damage his permanent record.\n\nOrozco told NBC: \u2018I was told he had put his hands on a teacher. I was shocked and asked for details on what happened, and then I was told that he hugged his gym teacher.\u2019\n\nThe boy, who is not named because of his age, said: \u2018At the end of the day, I just hugged her, nothing really happened.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOrozco told the Telegram that her foster son\u2019s race might have been a factor, as he is black and his teacher is white. Oroszo also said a school administrator told her the incident could have been perceived as sexual assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe admitted that he was fooling around with classmates in his gym class. He said his teacher then told him to sit out of the class dodgeball game.\n\n'European girl', 10, drowns in hot tub in Dubai after hair gets stuck in filter\n\n\u2018And then I went over just like, and gave her a hug and said, \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want to sit out\u201d because I like the game,\u2019 the boy said.\n\nAfter five minutes, the teacher allowed him to participate in the class, but he was then called to the principal\u2019s office during the next period.\n\nOrozco said: \u2018I don\u2019t expect the teacher to have to be OK with being touched or being hugged, but I do expect as an educator that she educate what the boundaries are in her classroom.\u2019\n\nPervert arrested after 'breaking into family's home wearing bra and panties'\n\n\u2018If you can admit to me that you didn\u2019t have a mechanism or a process, or any way of informing students what your expectations were, but then in the same breath you say to me, \u201cHe\u2019s 12, he should know hugs are not OK,\u201d it\u2019s confounding.\u2019\n\nAfter calling, emailing, and meeting with the school, Orozco was able to get the boy\u2019s suspension reduced to four days and the \u2018physical assault\u2019 mark on his record reduced to \u2018disruption of school.\u2019\n\nThe school has not commented on the matter.", "description": "A 12-year-old boy was suspended from Forest Grove Middle School in Worcester, Massachusetts for hugging a teacher.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1571164486_1571166165.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
