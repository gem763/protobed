At the UN he accused NGOs of wanting to keep the Amazon tribes living like \u201ccavemen.\u201d\n\nRaoni made it clear his people want to continue living as they always have on the ancestral lands that are increasingly under threat of invasions by illegal loggers, miners and land grabbers since Bolsonaro took office in January.\n\n\u201cMy concern is for the environment. Today everyone is worried. My work is to preserve the forest for all, for the survival of my grandchildren, the reservation lands, the indigenous peoples and the environment.\u201d\n\nLeftist PSOL party leader Ivan Valente said indigenous resistance was a roadblock to Bolsonaro\u2019s plans to open up the Amazon to development.\n\n\u201cHe is a national hero and known abroad as the greatest defender of the forest,\u201d Valente said.\n\n\u201cThat is why they fear the name Raoni,\u201d he said.", "description": "Indigenous chief Raoni Metuktire, proposed for the Nobel Peace Prize, said on Wednesday his people would not leave the Amazon and called on Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro to step down, a day after the head of state accused him of being a pawn of foreign interests.", "authors": ["Anthony Boadle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433899629&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O230", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
