The two new \u201cPro\u201d models, on the other hand, are follow-ups to the iPhone XS and XS Max, which supplanted the iPhone X.\n\nRead more: These are Apple\u2019s new iPhones: the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max\n\nWhile the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are tempting smartphones with all the latest Apple tech, the iPhone 11 is an incredible phone in its own right. Here are 9 reasons to consider the iPhone 11 instead of Apple\u2019s two new \u201cPro\u201d phones.\n\n1. The iPhone 11 is significantly cheaper than the iPhone 11 Pro models.\n\nsource Apple\n\niPhone 11 starts at $699\n\niPhone 11 Pro starts at $999\n\niPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099\n\nIn other words, you can save at least $300 by choosing the standard iPhone 11 instead of a \u201cPro\u201d 11, especially since all three new iPhones have the same starting storage of 64 GB.\n\nKeep this in mind as we examine the other differences.\n\n2. The iPhone 11 comes in more colors than the Pro models.\n\ncaption The iPhone 11 lineup. source Apple\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro models come in just four colors: space gray, silver, gold, and midnight green.\n\nThe iPhone 11, however, comes in six colors: purple, yellow, green, black, white, and red.\n\n3. The iPhone 11 has the ideal screen size: Not too big, but not too small.\n\nsource Apple\n\nHere are the new iPhone 11 sizes, from smallest to largest:\n\niPhone 11 Pro: 5.8-inch display\n\niPhone 11: 6.1-inch display\n\niPhone 11 Pro Max: 6.5-inch display\n\nWhile I personally love the 5.8-inch screen, I think the 6.1-inch display on the iPhone 11 will be best for most people. The Pro Max display is massive, while the normal Pro is solid, but potentially a little small for some people.\n\n4. The iPhone 11 doesn\u2019t have an OLED screen like the \u201cPro\u201d models, but its Liquid Retina display is still fantastic.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nOLED screens, like those in the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, produce richer colors and deeper contrast so blacks, in particular, really look inky and not gray.\n\nWhile the LCD screen in the iPhone 11 can\u2019t pull off the same OLED effect, the Liquid Retina display still provides high-quality picture and accurate colors. It\u2019s one of the best LCDs in any smartphone.\n\n5. The iPhone 11 and Pro models have identical rear camera systems, with one exception \u2014 but the one difference isn\u2019t a dealbreaker.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nThe iPhone 11 and 11 Pro models have a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens. The Pro models also have a 12-megapixel telephoto lens for zooming.\n\nA telephoto lens is only good for optical zooming, which doesn\u2019t lose any detail compared to digital zooming. But it\u2019s not a must-have feature. In fact, if you really care about smartphone photography, you shouldn\u2019t be using the zoom feature much to begin with.\n\n6. The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro models have identical front-facing cameras.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nThe iPhone 11 and 11 Pro models have a 12-megapixel selfie camera that supports 4K video up to 60 frames per second. They also have the same TrueDepth camera system that allows for Face ID, which can unlock your phone and help you make purchases.\n\n7. All three new iPhones have the same brains: Apple\u2019s A13 Bionic chip.\n\nsource Apple\n\nThis is a big deal. Apple\u2019s chipset \u2013 which contains the CPU, GPU, and neural engine to make your smartphone nimble and power-efficient \u2013 is the same across all three iPhones. So you shouldn\u2019t see any dip in performance by opting for the cheaper phone.\n\nAlso, the A13 Bionic is a monster.\n\nApple\u2019s A11 Bionic that powered the iPhone X was capable of 600 billion operations per second.\n\nThe A12 Bionic inside the iPhone XS and XR could power 5 trillion operations per second.\n\nThe new A13 Bionic, though, is capable of 8.5 trillion operations per second.\n\n8. The iPhone 11 is going to have incredible battery life.\n\nsource Apple\n\nLast year\u2019s iPhone XR had the best battery life in any Apple smartphone ever, with the ability to get about 15.5 to 16.5 hours in a single charge.\n\nThe iPhone 11 is expected to get one more hour of life compared to its predecessor, for about 16.5 to 17.5 hours.\n\nThe iPhone 11 and 11 Pro also have big batteries. The standard 11 Pro should have about the same 16.5 to 17.5 hours of life, but the 11 Pro Max should get a whopping 18.5 to 19.5 hours of life, according to Apple.\n\n9. The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro models share many of the same specs.\n\nsource Apple\n\nAll three models include the same:\n\nsplash and dust resistance rating (IP68)\n\nspatial audio with Dolby Atmos support\n\nBluetooth, WiFi 6, and LTE support\n\nDual-SIM support\n\nPhoto and video features like Night mode, QuickTake, and Deep Fusion\n\nthe new U1 chip for direct AirDrop file transfers\n\nWhile the iPhone 11 Pro has a few advantages over the standard 11 \u2014 a superior display, a telephoto lens, slightly more water resistance, and slightly faster cell connectivity \u2014 those differences probably don\u2019t justify a $300+ price difference for most people.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nIf you\u2019re on the fence between these phones, opt for the more affordable iPhone 11.\n\nThis may be the last year of the \u201cnotch\u201d \u2013 that blocked-out portion of your iPhone\u2019s display that allows room for the front-facing camera system \u2013 and you might want to upgrade once the iPhone adopts a cleaner look. Plus, 5G support is rumored for next year\u2019s iPhones, and you might want a piece of that action in just 12 months from now.\n\nUnless you haven\u2019t upgraded in years and you desperately want the best Apple can offer, most people are going to be very happy with the standard iPhone 11. It means you can spend less money now on a quality phone, and save more money for the future when you\u2019re really ready to invest in an all-new experience.\n\nYou can learn about Apple\u2019s new iPhones, and preorder them, on Apple\u2019s website. All the new iPhone 11 models will release to the public on Friday, September 20.\n\nDo you plan on buying one of the new iPhone 11 models?\n\nsource Apple\n\nTell us what you\u2019re thinking: Do you like the iPhone 11 best, or are you tempted by the iPhone 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max?
