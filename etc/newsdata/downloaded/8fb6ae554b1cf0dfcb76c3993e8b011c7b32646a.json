(AP) \u2014 Apparently, not everything's perfect with No. 3 Clemson.\n\nTigers coach Dabo Swinney said backup kicker Steven Sawicki would start on Saturday against Louisville after starter B.T. Potter missed a 24-yard field goal try right before halftime against Florida State. It was Potter's second straight miss after a 40-yard attempt at North Carolina didn't go through.\n\nClemson's offense originally lined up for a fourth-and-2 at the FSU 7 right before the half and leading 28-0. But Swinney called time out and sent Potter in for the chip-shot kick.\n\nAfter the miss, Swinney angrily lit into Potter and yelled at him as both walked down the sidelines.\n\nSwinney said Sunday he was \"disappointed\" with Potter and felt like it was time to give Sawicki the chance.\n\nSawicki made both extra points and a 26-yard field goal in the second half of Clemson's 45-14 win over the Seminoles.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
