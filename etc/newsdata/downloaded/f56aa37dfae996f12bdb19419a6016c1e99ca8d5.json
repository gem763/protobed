People only \u2018know\u2019 what they see on the internet.\u201d\n\nCyrus went on to address the double standard between men and women when it comes to dating.\n\n\u201cMen (especially successful ones) are RARELY slut shamed,\u201d she said. \"They move on from one beautiful young woman to the next MOST times without consequence. They are usually referred to as \u2018legends,\u2019 \u2018heart throbs,\u2019 \u2018G,\u2019 \u2018Ladies Man,\u2019 etc\u2026. where women are called sluts/whores!\u201d\n\nMILEY CRYUS TEASES NEW MUSIC, SAYS SHE'S FEELING 'INSPIRED' AFTER KAITLYNN CARTER SPLIT\n\n\u201cI am trying to just THRIVE/survive in a 'mans' world,\u201d Cyrus explained. \u201cIf we can\u2019t beat em, join em!\n\n\u201cIf our president can \u2018grab em by the p-----\u2019\u2026. can\u2019t I just have a kiss and an a\u00e7ai bowl?!?!\u201d she added.\n\nAs previously reported, Simpson, 22, and Cyrus were seen sharing a kiss at an eatery on Thursday, according to video obtained by TMZ. (The two were first linked back in late 2014, but in 2015 Simpson told GQ Australia that they were \"just mates.\")\n\nMILEY CYRUS SPOTTED KISSING SINGER CODY SIMPSON AFTER KAITLYNN CARTER, LIAM HEMSWORTH SPLITS\n\nCyrus split from Hemsworth, 29, in August after just seven months of marriage. As the news of her divorce broke, Cyrus was spotted on an Italian vacation with reality TV star Kaitlynn Carter, who in turn had just split from her husband Brody Jenner.\n\nCarter, 31, and Cyrus called it quits in September after just over a month of dating.\n\nIn a follow-up post, Cyrus explained that she is going to continue to be out-and-about with the person she is \"dating.\"\n\nMILEY CYRUS INSISTS SHE NEVER CHEATED ON LIAM HEMSWORTH\n\n\u201cI refuse to recluse and \u2018date\u2019 from home cause A. That\u2019s not fun B. Extremely uncomfortable/puts me in a vulnerable position,\" she said. \u201cI would like to share an activity with someone I am dating and not be stuck at home with pretty much nothing to do but \u2018Netflix and chill.'\n\n\"This \u2018dating\u2019 thing is new to me too,\u201d she continued.\n\n\"I've never been an 'adult'/grown a-- woman experiencing this .... I was in a committed relationship for almost All my teens and early 20s; with the exception of a few breaks,\" the \"Break Away\" singer added, seemingly referencing her relationship to Hemsworth. (The pair first met on the set of the 2010 film \"The Last Song\" and became engaged in 2012 only to end their relationship in September 2013. They rekindled their romance in 2015.)\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nCyrus went on to say that \"usually in those times\" she was working her \"a-- off with not much R&R.\"\n\n\"And 'meeting/trusting' people in my position is really tuff,\" she noted. \"Don\u2019t f--king pity me, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking for. I have a great life I wouldn\u2019t trade for \u2018privacy\u2019 but PLEASE don\u2019t make this awkward for me!\u201d\n\nShe concluded her post by saying: \u201cI am trying to make light and like always MAKE FUN of myself/and the public\u2019s perception of me! Get used to me dating \u2014 this is where I\u2019m at! #HotGirlFall.\"", "description": "Miley Cyrus is speaking her piece.", "authors": ["Mariah Haas"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Miley-Cyrus-GettyImages-1154326430.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
