(Karsten Moran/The New York Times)\n\nSaving the oceans is key to fighting the climate crisis, according to Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a Brooklyn-born marine biologist and activist who is a rising figure in the climate movement.\n\nJohnson, 39, is the founder of Ocean Collectiv, a conservation consultancy, and of Urban Ocean Lab, a think tank, and speaks frequently at TED Talks, climate rallies and her salons at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn. Protecting the ocean is crucial for people at all economic levels, she said, not just bicoastal elites who look down their noses at plastic straws.\n\nQ: You have talked a lot about how the oceans are crucial in the fight against climate change. How so?\n\nA: When people talk about the destruction of the Amazon, and how forests in general are the lungs of the planet, I always want to jump in and say the ocean is a huge part of that, too.\n\nPhytoplankton \u2014 these tiny little plants in the ocean \u2014 produce a huge percentage of the oxygen we breathe, and the population of phytoplankton is declining. That should be a cause for concern for every single person.\n\nQ: You hear a lot of talk about plastic straws. Is that issue really a big deal or is it greenwashing?\n\nA: Straws are not the biggest problem facing the ocean, but they are an opportunity to think about what else we can do to reduce our impact on the planet.\n\nIt really cracked me up the other day. I was walking down the street in Fort Greene, the neighborhood where I grew up and where I live now, and I saw this guy looking super-stylish carrying an iced coffee in a plastic to-go coffee cup with a plastic lid, and I turned to look, and he\u2019s got a metal straw in the cup.\n\nPart of me wanted to just hit it out of his hand and be like, \u201cDude, you\u2019re totally missing the point! If you\u2019re going to bring a straw, just bring your own cup!\u201d\n\nQ: Some of those straws, I guess, can end up in the \u201cGreat Pacific Garbage Patch.\u201d Are there any steps we can take to tackle that?\n\nA: I kind of recoil at this question, to be honest, because I feel like this has been done a million times: carry your own water bottle, carry your own grocery bags. But I think there is a harder answer, which is that it does actually require some sacrifice.\n\nLike I\u2019ll be walking down the street and I want to get a Juice Press because I\u2019m hungry and I didn\u2019t bring enough snacks for the day, and I don\u2019t. There is an element of: \u201cDon\u2019t buy the thing that\u2019s in plastic.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no cute answer, right? Nothing that is disposable can be sustainable.\n\nQ: The United Nations says that 93% of commercial fish stocks are being fished at or beyond capacity. What kind of fish should we avoid eating?\n\nA: Pending changes which could come at any moment, the U.S. still does a very good job of managing our fish population. So eat U.S. seafood and support your fishermen who are doing it right.\n\nAnd eat lower on the food chain. Instead of tuna, eat sardines and anchovies \u2014 those little ones that are reproducing super-quickly. Because tuna is so far up the food chain, if we were eating the land equivalent of tuna, it would be like eating whatever kind of dragon eats a lion. It\u2019s this incredible beast, and we will never be able to have sustainable tuna fishing at scale.\n\nQ: Is farmed seafood preferable to wild?\n\nA: The sustainability of fish farming is improving, but farmed fish are still often grown in high densities, and so there\u2019s a lot of spread of disease and pollution.\n\nBut ocean farming of shellfish \u2014 oysters, mussels and clams \u2014 and seaweed is super-sustainable, and we should all be eating more of those things because they actually just live off of nutrients in the water and sunlight.\n\nIn fact, eating shellfish like oysters can be more sustainable than being totally vegan, because it\u2019s just such an efficient and low-carbon way to make protein. Shellfish are absorbing carbon as they\u2019re making their shells. And seaweed is absorbing tons of CO2, because they\u2019re plants.\n\nQ: Some people think ocean conservation is an elitist issue for people with beach houses. Why does it matter for people across the economic spectrum?\n\nA: It\u2019s no coincidence which communities bear the brunt of sea level rise, pollution and strengthened storms. Along the coasts, it\u2019s poor communities and communities of color who are most at risk. It\u2019s those who already have the fewest resources who are most in danger, not people with vacation homes and yachts.
