Ten years later that figure has risen starkly from 3.7% to 12.5%\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014 the rate of children in absolute poverty went from 5% to 10% with the same trend for those in so-called \"relative poverty.\"\n\n\"Today, we have across Italy, over 1.2 million children in absolute poverty. These children are distributed across the country, with those in the greatest difficulties in the Southern regions,\" says Head of Poverty Department at Save the Children Italy, Annapaola Specchio.\n\nThe report from the campaign \"Let's Light Up The Future\" also said one in seven children in Italy has dropped out of education.\n\n\"Educational poverty prevents children from building their future, in particular, it prevents them from developing their talents. These conditions put an entire generation out of the country's growth,\" says Specchio.\n\nWATCH: Michele Prosperi from Save the Children, Italy told Euronews that the children don't have enough resources to cope with life", "description": "Save the children in Rome has released its latest edition of the Atlas on At-Risk Children in Italy report on the occasion of the launch of the campaign 'Let's Light Up The Future'.", "authors": ["Katy Dartford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/96/56/1000x563_cmsv2_a6c03d34-d8de-5d10-8762-1f0f311fd9bb-4249656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
