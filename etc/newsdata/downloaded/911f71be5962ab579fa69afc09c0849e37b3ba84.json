So 50 [percent] doesn\u2019t work for us. So we\u2019ve got to stay away from politics when the social gets over into politics.\u201d\n\nPolitics and social justice issues have frequently been given the spotlight in the NFL after former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the National Anthem in 2016 to highlight racial inequality, police brutality, and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAs the protest quickly spread to other players on other teams, the billionaire businessman and Trump supporter told his Cowboys players that they would be required to stand for the anthem.\n\nSep 25, 2017; Glendale, AZ, USA; Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones kneels with players prior to the national anthem prior to the game against the Arizona Cardinals at University of Phoenix Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports More\n\nNFL owners voted in favor of a policy that would allow players to stay in the locker rooms in protest if they didn\u2019t want to stand during the anthem. It was a policy that Jones did not support. \"Our policy is that you stand at the anthem, toe on the line,\u201d he said last year. (Jones also added at the time that he thought President Trump\u2019s \u201cinterest in what we're doing is problematic from my chair, and I would say in general the owners' chair.\")\n\nThough his position on the anthem is clear, he said, he believes that athletes \u2014 and the NFL \u2014 should use their platform to highlight activist issues.\n\n\u201cSociety says if you\u2019re going to get all this attention, you\u2019re going to get all these eyeballs, then use it to help society in any way you can,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cI never thought that I\u2019d be working on bullying,\u201d he continued. \u201cOr I never thought I\u2019d be working on many of these other social issues. You bet there\u2019s a lot of things that we can do better in this country. To the extent that the NFL has the platform and the visibility, we should use it.\u201d\n\nThe NFL isn\u2019t the only league that has seen athletes use their platform to call attention to social justice issues. During the Pan American games this month, a few American competitors kneeled or raised fists during the anthem. With the upcoming 2020 Olympics, it is possible that Olympians in Tokyo will mirror their protests.\n\nKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
