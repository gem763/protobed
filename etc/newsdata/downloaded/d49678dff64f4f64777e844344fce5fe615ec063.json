Researchers Find Viral Clues", "language": "en", "text": "Luca Waugh, 9, who was 4 years old when he was diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis, a mysterious neurological condition that can cause limb weakness and polio-like paralysis, wears his neck brace while stretching before going on a bike ride, at his home in Berkeley, Calif., Oct. 15, 2019. (Brian L. Frank/The New York Times)\n\nAbout 10 days after what seemed like a garden-variety cold, Luca Waugh, a healthy 4-year-old, developed troubling symptoms.\n\nSuddenly, his neck became so weak that he fell backward. Then his right arm couldn\u2019t move. Within days, recalled his mother, Dr. Riley Bove, he developed \u201chead-to-toe paralysis, where he could kind of move his eyes a little bit and one side of his face.\u201d\n\nDoctors diagnosed Luca with acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, a mysterious neurological condition that can cause limb weakness and poliolike paralysis, mostly in young children. AFM is rare, but in 2014, when Luca became afflicted, health authorities identified a burst of 120 cases. Since then, AFM has made headlines as cases have spiked every two years, and nearly 600 have been confirmed across the country since 2014.\n\nWhat causes AFM has eluded experts, frustrating attempts to prevent or treat it.\n\nNow, a study by a team that includes Luca\u2019s mother, Bove, a neurologist, provides strong evidence of a likely cause. It involved dozens of children with AFM, including Luca, whose paralysis improved after weeks of hospitalization but who remains disabled five years later.\n\nThe research, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, points to a long-suspected culprit: enteroviruses, a group of common viruses that usually produce mild effects but can sometimes cause neurological symptoms. Using sophisticated laboratory techniques, researchers found antibodies to enteroviruses in the cerebrospinal fluid of nearly 70% of the children with AFM, a sign their bodies had mobilized to defend against enterovirus infection.\n\nBy comparison, the team, led by researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, found enterovirus antibodies in only 7% of children with other neurological illnesses.\n\nThe findings support another recent study in which Columbia University researchers, using a different technique with fewer patients, also found enterovirus antibodies in spinal fluid.\n\n\u201cThis takes us a lot further than we have been,\u201d said Dr. Avindra Nath, a senior investigator for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who was not involved in either study. \u201cComing from two entirely different laboratories with two entirely different techniques, we are now at the point where we can say we have a candidate virus to study.\u201d\n\nEnteroviruses have been suspected in AFM, partly because of its similarity to polio, a type of enterovirus now vanquished by vaccines in most countries, including the United States. Also, the recent every-other-year AFM surges have occurred between August and October, when certain enteroviruses flourish.\n\nThe strongest suspect has been enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that increased AFM cases often coincided with greater prevalence of EV-D68. Also, EV-D68 can produce AFM-like symptoms in mice. Another possible suspect is enterovirus A71 (EV-A71).\n\nBut finding evidence is difficult. AFM\u2019s paralysis and weakness usually occur days after common cold symptoms.\n\nAnd while enteroviruses have been detected in stool and respiratory mucus of some AFM patients, substantiating a role in neurological disease requires evidence involving cerebrospinal fluid, which circulates in the brain and spinal cord. But enteroviruses dissipate quickly from this fluid. The CDC has found enteroviruses (EV-D68, EV-A71 or Coxsackievirus) in cerebrospinal fluid in only four of the 590 cases since 2014.\n\nThe Nature Medicine study involved nearly 500,000 DNA protein fragments from thousands of viruses that infect humans and other vertebrates or are carried by mosquitoes and ticks, said the senior author, Dr. Michael R. Wilson, a UCSF neurologist specializing in mysterious neurological illnesses.\n\nUsing a technique called phage display, each fragment was inserted into a bacteriophage, a type of virus that sticks to bacteria. Each bacteriophage displayed a specific fragment on its surface like a billboard. Then the researchers incubated a \u201csoup\u201d of bacteriophages with a patient\u2019s spinal fluid sample, Wilson said.\n\n\u201cYou let the patient\u2019s antibodies find the virus that\u2019s expressing the DNA that matches, and they bind,\u201d he said.\n\nEnterovirus antibodies were found in 29 of 42 children who developed AFM across the country in 2014, 2016 and 2018. One was Luca. After he got sick in Boston in 2014, Bove, then at Harvard Medical School, sent his samples to Wilson, a friend she met during medical training.", "description": "About 10 days after what seemed like a garden-variety cold, Luca Waugh, a healthy 4-year-old, developed troubling symptoms.Suddenly, his neck became so weak that he fell backward.
