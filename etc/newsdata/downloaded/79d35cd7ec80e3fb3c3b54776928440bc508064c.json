UEFA should make an example of them, the legal armoury is there.\n\n'Our observers told us they saw at the beginning of the game at least 20 people entered wearing the bibs of technical staff, took them off and just joined the fans.\n\nThe UEFA racism protocol was followed and reached stage two of three during the first half\n\nBulgarian fans with hoods and face masks, some of them with 'hooligans' printed on their shirts, head for the exits after the second stoppage on Monday evening\n\nUEFA'S THREE-STEP PROTOCOL 1 - The referee will speak to the stadium announcer and demand the halting of racist behaviour. 2 - If it continues, the referee can take the players off the field into the dressing rooms for a period of time and the stadium announcer will make another address. 3 - If it still continues, the match will be abandoned.\n\n'They are basically employed as stadium staff. That is not that rare in eastern Europe \u2014 many hooligan group members are connected to a club as security staff or stewards.\n\n'Everyone knew exactly where in the stadium the problems were going to happen, yet there was not any screening of the fans. This is just negligence.\n\n'The Bulgarian FA president Borislav should step down, the organisation of this match has been shambolic and his posturing and lack of leadership has made things worse.'\n\nKlymenko's comments about the FA president were echoed by the country's own Prime Minister Boyko Borissov.\n\nBorissov said Tuesday night's events were 'unacceptable', and the country's sports minister Krasen Kralev said: 'After the recent events, having in mind the whole state of football and last night's incidents, the prime minister has ordered me from today to suspend any relations with the BFU, including financial ones, until the resignation of Borislav Mihaylov.'\n\nBREAKDOWN OF EVENTS IN ENGLAND'S 6-0 WIN IN BULGARIA The game was halted TWICE as home fans abuse black players, brandish 'No Respect' shirts and make Nazi salutes in planned racist onslaught\n\nTyrone Mings reveals vile chants started before kick-off in Bulgaria\n\nMarcus Rashford praises 'courage' of Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov for appealing to fans at half-time to stop racist taunting of England players\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate considered taking his players off the pitch against Bulgaria as FA chairman Greg Clarke condemns racist taunting\n\nBulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov claimed not to have heard any chanting and said in his post-match press conference: 'The unacceptable behaviour was by England fans.'\n\nIan Wright says England players taking action against racism made him 'feel really good'\n\nRaheem Sterling calls out Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov for saying England have a bigger racism problem than his own country and posts funny Ainsley Harriott meme in response to Piers Morgan hailing his performance in face of vile racist abuse\n\nUEFA will use evidence from specialist 'spotters' in the crowd and TV footage to prosecute after Bulgarian fans' appalling racist taunts\n\nBulgaria's prime minister has called on the president of their FA to quit over the racist incidents\n\nPrime Minister Boyko Borissov (R) is demanding FA president Borislav Mihaylov steps down", "description": "Onlookers from football's anti-discrimination body Fare, as reported by The Times, were at the Vasil Levski Stadium as a series of racist chants and actions came from the stands.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19728656-0-image-a-77_1571144771203.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
