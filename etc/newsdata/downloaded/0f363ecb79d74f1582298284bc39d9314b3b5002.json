Somehow they all survived.\n\nThe victims were rushed to hospital for treatment but five have since been discharged and the other four remain in a stable condition, Moroccan news outlet Le360 reports.\n\nA couple could be seen on the restaurant's CCTV moments before the vehicle came crashing through the eatery in Marrakesh, Morocco\n\nOne man who was sitting in the path of the Hyundai got up after the crash and was miraculously unharmed\n\nThe driver fled the scene but police say he is known to officers and a manhunt is under way.\n\nA man and a woman were sitting in the path of the vehicle as it sped through the cafe and smashed into the couple.\n\nShocking video of the crash has gone viral on social media showing the heart-stopping incident.\n\nIt shows diners talking over food in the quiet restaurant when suddenly they heard a commotion in the street.\n\nAs they looked up they saw the car bearing down on them with no time to get out of the way.\n\nIn the blink of an eye it demolished all the chairs and tables and violently knocked down every customer in view.\n\nIncredibly, one man who bore the brunt of the impact was seen getting back to his feet apparently unhurt.\n\nChairs, tables and customers were sent flying by the out-of-control vehicle as it smashed its way through the cafe\n\nEmployees rushed to help victims of the crash that left the small cafe a wreck after the impact\n\nStunned by his near-death experience, he put his hands on his head and exhaled deeply as he paced around in circles and checked himself for injuries.\n\nAnother victim could be seen also walking away clutching his head.\n\nOther videos filmed by witnesses show the extent of the damage as broken furniture littered the restaurant patio area.\n\nThe wrecked Hyundai was pictured at a standstill inside the restaurant covered by debris, as injured people lay on the ground beside it.\n\nThe restaurant is said to be a popular hangout for students at the nearby university.\n\nHad the crash happened a few hours earlier the place would have been packed with students and tourists.\n\nLocal media reports that the fugitive suspect faces charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and failing to stop following a collision.", "description": "Horrifying CCTV footage showed diners casually eating and chatting seconds before a grey Hyundai came  hurtling towards them at around 2am in Marrakech.
