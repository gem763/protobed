(For comparison, Sony\u2019s RX100 VI, which features a 1-inch sensor, is only marginally smaller at 4.0 x 2.3 x 1.7 inches.)\n\nDespite the small size of the body, you\u2019ll still need to attach a lens to it. Given the size of most full-frame lenses, that means you\u2019ll have a slightly awkward weight to balance, but the fp\u2019s diminutive form factor does look pretty impressive.\n\nFrom a shooting perspective, the fp supports an ISO range of 100-25600, offers a 49-point autofocus system, and features electronic image stabilization. It also can shoot full 4K video. Sigma is also swapping out the mechanical shutter in favor of an electronic shutter, which it says should also allow for quieter shooting.\n\nThe fp is also Sigma\u2019s first camera to use Leica\u2019s L-mount lens standard, for which Sigma also announced three new lenses. The fp can also be used with a variety of existing Canon and Sigma lenses through the use of an adapter.\n\nThe first version of the fp will offer a Bayer sensor, not the Foveon sensors that Sigma typically uses, although PetaPixel notes that the company teased that a Foveon sensor version is planned for the future, too.\n\nDespite the small size, the camera still offers all of the ports and options that you\u2019d expect from a full-frame camera: there\u2019s a 3.2-inch touchscreen (which takes up most of the back of the camera), an SD card slot, HDMI port, and support for an external flash sync, mic, headphone, and remote shutter. You won\u2019t find an electronic viewfinder, however.\n\nThe Sigma fp is set to be released later this fall, although no price has been announced yet.", "description": "Sigma has announced its first full-frame mirrorless camera, the Sigma fp, and the company is looking to make an impression on the market with the claim that it\u2019s the \"smallest & lightest\" full-frame mirrorless camera in the world.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jidi-pDET6q6e0-vCr2HmPaV9No=/0x65:1280x735/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18303329/sigma1.png", "published_at": "2019-07-11"}
