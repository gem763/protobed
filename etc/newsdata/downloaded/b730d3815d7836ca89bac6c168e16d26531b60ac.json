Mike DeWine says the waiver will help the state confront the deadly epidemic tied to prescription painkillers, heroin and illegal fentanyl.\n\nIt will allow Ohio to provide critical care to mothers and babies exposed to opioids, expand recovery support and enhance residential treatment services.\n\nThe state\u2019s waiver application said the demonstration would permit Ohio\u2019s Department of Medicaid to provide medically-necessary health care, mental health and substance use services in the most appropriate and cost-effective setting, which often is a community-based facility rather than a hospital.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The federal government is allowing Ohio more flexibility in what services it can provide to Medicaid patients addicted to opioids.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
