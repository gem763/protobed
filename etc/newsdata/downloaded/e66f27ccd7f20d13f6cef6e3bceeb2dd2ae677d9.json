Approximately 75% of our relationship took place in my head. When I came down with a bronchial infection, I saw it as a heaven-sent opportunity for us to finally really connect. Lying on the futon-mattress-on-the-floor which was my bed, I might as well have been rubbing my hands together in anticipation of how he would care for me. Through that care, our love would blossom. I could already taste the chicken soup.\n\nIt didn\u2019t play out as I\u2019d hoped. When I called him and asked, sickly-yet-cutely, if he could bring me some soup, he seemed confused by the request. In fact, he expressed his bewilderment more eloquently than he had ever expressed anything to me before. The symbolic importance of the soup appeared to be completely lost on him. If I was sick\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be best if he left me alone? Maybe we could hang out again when I was feeling better? I remember feeling humiliated, like I\u2019d been stood up on a date.\n\nI diagnosed him as immature, but Dr. Gary Chapman, author of the blockbuster, perennially best-selling relationship advice book The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts, would probably have read it differently. He would have explained that we were speaking different \u201clove languages.\u201d I was and remain someone who loves small acts of consideration. Not everyone thinks a plastic container of soup can contain heavy romantic overtones, but I do. Maybe my erstwhile boyfriend\u2019s love language was something different, like gift giving, or physical touch.\n\nChapman\u2019s Love Languages, first published in 1992, argues that many relationship conflicts can be explained by his theory of romantic miscommunication. (Later editions of the book extended the love languages doctrine to apply to all kinds of relationships, from parents and children to co-workers.) \u201cThere\u2019s a universal human need to feel loved,\u201d he writes in the book. But he takes this platitude further; the premise of his wildly influential life's work is that each of us have a love language that we use to express love, and that this is usually this is the way we want to be shown love, too. Two people in a relationship might express love to each other using different \u201clanguages,\u201d and this would make it hard for them to \u201cunderstand\u201d each other. Chapman advises us that figuring out our love language can help us ask for the type of love we need. For the uninitiated, these are: quality time; gift giving; words of affirmation; acts of service; and physical touch. Not sure what your love language is? Just take this easy quiz. I\u2019m an \u201cacts of service,\u201d with a \u201cwords of affirmation\u201d rising.\n\nMany people find this theory and these categories cheesy. The appeal is, shall we say, broad. Describing oneself in terms of a \u201ctype\u201d strikes some people as pretty reductive\u2014stupid, even. But the simplicity of the love languages is key to its phenomenal success.\n\nTwenty-seven years after the Love Languages was first published, its influence continues to grow. With almost every consecutive year, the book breaks its previous year\u2019s sales record. It has now sold over 12 million copies and has been translated into 51 languages, most recently into Arabic for a Saudi Arabian edition. Since its publication, the concept of \u201clove languages\u201d has seeped into the collective consciousness, to the point that today, as a pop-psychological idea, the term has become ubiquitous, one people even unfamiliar with its origin understand.\n\nIn the West we have an affinity for classifying ourselves into types, and the love languages have joined the Myers-Briggs personality test as a go-to romantic rubric, as familiar to many people as the twelve signs of the Zodiac. They\u2019re constantly referenced in popular advice columns, and on blogs. In the last few months alone the love languages have figured in interpersonal drama on reality shows such as Love Island, Are You the One? and Real Housewives of the Potomac. People riff on the concept constantly, extending the metaphor far beyond its intended, abstract purpose. Wine-making is a love language. Fried cheese is a love language. Baseball pitchers are a love language. Toni Morrison is a love language.\n\nGary Chapman never planned to be a self-help guru capable of this kind of impact. 80 years old, he has been a pastoral counselor at a Baptist congregation in Winston-Salem, North Carolina for 48 of those years. His Baptist faith informs his belief in the importance of long-term commitment\u2014he has been married to Karolyn J. Chapman since they were in their early twenties\u2014but you don\u2019t need to be a Baptist to appreciate his practical approach to making it work. Most of us here on Earth hate feeling vulnerable, and expressing the need to be loved is an exquisitely unpleasant flavor of vulnerability. It\u2019s the pulpy center of love-maintenance that we avoid at all cost. We\u2019d rather quit and start fresh with someone new than poke that pulp.\n\nThe 5 Love Languages is one of the few popular relationship advice books that shows us a way to maintain a relationship without advising us to turn inward and self-optimize. The love languages function as a clever rhetorical bait-and-switch that allow us to be honest about our needs without opening up the abyss of vulnerability that, unfortunately, exists within all of us. Saying \u201cI need more attention from you\u201d is painful, but saying \u201cmy love language is quality time\u201d is somehow less so. The love languages might be cheesy, but their most profound wisdom is an underlying truth that Chapman might not have even meant to convey: Asking for love is the worst, he suggests, but we need to do it.\n\nLove, unlike capitalism, doesn\u2019t require continuous growth to survive. The economy of love is based on maintenance, not growth, and born capitalists like us Americans would much rather create and grow something new than maintain something that already exists. To be loved, we don\u2019t need to keep improving and updating ourselves, coming up with new personality traits and skills with which to surprise and entertain our loved ones. But the hard work of self-improvement is easier for many of us to swallow than the hard work of maintaining a long-term partnership, as exemplified by your commitment-phobic ex or your recently divorced sister.\n\nWesterners believe in the redemptive power of reinvention. We promise ourselves that next time it will be different. This belief is the essence of consumer culture, and it\u2019s tempting to see relationships in the same way as we see consumer goods: as things that are supposed to make us feel good. Chapman sees through this fallacy because he\u2019s a Baptist, but as the success of his book and now brand shows, you don\u2019t have to believe in a God to agree with him.\n\n\"Practical suggestions\" for how to practice the love languages in your life on any given week\n\nThe first golden age of self-help literature in the United States came during the 60s and 70s, when books like Thomas A. Harris\u2019 I\u2019m OK\u2014You\u2019re OK provided moral support to conventional middle-class Americans who felt unsure of how to navigate the new social and sexual mores that had arisen from the 1960s counterculture.\n\nBut by the '90s, many veterans of the counterculture had settled down. Maybe the sexual experimentation of the '70s was exhausting, right down down to The Joy of Sex's very groovy illustrations, because in 1992, two of the best-selling relationship self-help books of all time were published: The 5 Love Languages, and John A. Gray\u2019s Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus. Both books are fundamentally conservative; Men Are From Mars argues that men and women have different \u201cnatures,\u201d while the Love Languages is dedicated to making marriages last. (Divorce is scarcely mentioned as an option.)\n\nMen Are From Mars has sold approximately 15 million copies to date, making it the best-selling relationship self-help book of all time. But based as it is on a set of gender stereotypes that many 10-year-olds could handily dismantle in 2019, it hasn\u2019t aged well, and as such, its sales have fallen off in recent years.\n\nIn a world hell-bent on trying out new stuff until the world ends, whatever the cost, Chapman\u2019s vision of accepting each other\u2019s need to be loved is downright radical.\n\nIn contrast, Love Languages continues to pick up speed. During its first year of publication, the book sold about 8,500 copies, far exceeding the expectations of its publisher, Moody, a division of the nonprofit Moody Bible Institute; Love Languages itself is published by their more secular imprint started that same year, Northfield Publishing. The following year, the number doubled. In 2009, sales hit 5 million copies, and Moody relaunched the Love Languages with what they called their \u201cmost aggressive marketing campaign in a decade.\u201d As part of the new campaign, John Hinkley, the director of marketing at Moody at the time, remarked that \u201cour goal, our vision is to help reduce the number of divorces.\u201d As a nonprofit, Moody uses the book\u2019s proceeds to fund the Moody Bible Institute, which exists to \u201ceducate and equip students for Christian ministry.\u201d\n\nThe book\u2019s initial success was largely thanks to sales at Christian bookstores, but the relaunch pushed it squarely into the mainstream. In 2011, Elizabeth Hasselbeck may have been a linchpin in the book\u2019s crossover secular success when she held up her copy of the book on the View, announcing that it had saved her marriage. Two years later, Oprah made its place of honor in our culture official by inviting Chapman onto an episode of Oprah\u2019s Lifeclass. (For those wondering, Oprah\u2019s love language is words of affirmation.)\n\nNow, the love languages are a full-on brand, with an app called Love Nudge introduced this year that \"will help you put the concepts of The 5 Love Languages\u00ae into action in ways that are easy, obvious, and satisfying,\" radio programs, and conferences. But getting in touch with Chapman is easier than you\u2019d think, considering he\u2019s been on the New York Times best-seller list on and off for more than half my lifetime. In the days leading up to our interview, friends eagerly sent me questions they wanted him to answer, mostly to do with his feelings about the rules around \u201cphysical touch,\u201d the love language that some people (myself included) had always understood as a cute euphemism for sex. Are any of the languages more \u201cpowerful\u201d than others? Does Chapman think of them hierarchically?\n\nOver the phone, I found Chapman to be friendly and indulgent, though when questions don\u2019t appeal to him, he issues forth a good natured chuckle that means \u201cno comment.\u201d Talking with him is remarkably similar to reading his book; he speaks with a drawl, and has a folksy, unpretentious manner befitting a man of religion but perhaps not of someone who has risen to the level of success he has.\n\nChapman studied anthropology in college, and told me he\u2019s remained fascinated with cultural nuances. The first foreign edition of Love Languages was in Spanish, and Chapman wasn\u2019t sure it would work in a translated edition; it became a best-seller. The success of future foreign editions has reinforced his belief that the need to feel loved is a human universal.\n\nChapman has published many companion editions to the original book, including a \u201cMilitary Edition,\u201d an edition for teens, one for families raising children with special needs, and a book about using the languages in the workplace (they\u2019re \u201clanguages of appreciation\u201d in that context, though). If you take the online quiz to determine your love language, you can sign up for Chapman\u2019s weekly newsletter, which comes full of practical tips for integrating love language awareness into your daily life. Is your partner a physical touch person? Try kissing them good morning and goodnight, each day for a week. Before you know it, Chapman reminds us, you\u2019ll have established a new habit.\n\nMuch of the advice seems like common sense, but the newsletters almost always contain a wholesome Easter egg like, \u201cIf your spouse leaves their laptop open, change the desktop background (if you don't think they'll mind) to a picture of you together. Overlay text on the picture that says, \u2018I Love You.\u2019\u201d (This was offered as a tip for showing love to people whose love language is words of affirmation. In Chapman\u2019s world, we have nothing to hide\u2014on our laptops or anywhere else.)\n\nChapman deliberately kept his book\u2019s Christian message subtle so that more people would read it. (After submitting a manuscript to Moody Press in the 70s that he had been using for his marriage seminars, and initially being rejected, he would publish two much more religiously focused relationship books before the Love Languages took off, Toward a Growing Marriage, and Hope for the Separated.) \u201cSome people tell me they didn\u2019t know I was a Christian until they got to the end of the book, which is fine,\u201d said Chapman. \u201cToward the end of the book, I say something to the effect of, what I\u2019ve given you is information. I can\u2019t give you motivation, but I\u2019ll tell you how I got my motivation. And I have a paragraph about my relationship with God, and how that changed my relationship with people.\u201d\n\nThe love languages, Chapman maintains, apply to everyone, regardless of religious belief. He admits that \u201cmany men I know will say, \u2018I know my love language! It\u2019s physical touch!\u2019 But I\u2019d argue it\u2019s often more subtle than that.\u201d The gender neutrality of the languages means that the book can make sense for same-sex couples, nonbinary people\u2014anyone. \u201cI relate to people who seek my counseling as human beings,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if I can help same sex couples in their relationships, that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nChapman\u2019s religious background asserts itself through what it omits rather than what it states.\n\nThe world of the love languages is simpler than the world most of us live in. There\u2019s no manipulation, or duplicitousness, or gaslighting\u2014just people trying to fulfill the basic human need to feel loved, or, as Chapman puts it, to \u201cfill up their love tanks.\u201d Chapman\u2019s old-fashioned family-values vibe turns some people off. But its resistance to a vision of perpetual self-improvement makes the book quietly subversive.\n\n\u201cNever stop growing,\u201d contemporary society implores us. \u201cYou\u2019re a badass! Be awesome! Be bold and courageous. Go out and claim what you deserve!\u201d Meanwhile, Chapman\u2019s love languages encourage us to focus our attention and care on what we already have. He may have been compelled to write the book by a Christian belief in the moral victory of long-lasting marriage. But this kind of conservatism can also be understood as oriented towards sustainability rather than waste. In a world hell-bent on trying out new stuff until the world ends, whatever the cost, Chapman\u2019s vision of accepting each other\u2019s need to be loved is downright radical.\n\nThe love languages have achieved the status of clinical legitimacy without having been the product of any kind of actual research beyond Chapman\u2019s own observations as a church counselor. In 2006, two academic researchers conducted an empirical study to determine whether the love languages model generated consistent results of improved \u201crelational maintenance.\u201d Although the study wasn\u2019t completely conclusive, the researchers did find that using the love languages model led to a \u201cclose match\u201d with improved relationships.\n\nBut whether or not there\u2019s empirical evidence to back them up, the love languages are a fully integrated part of the American therapeutic landscape, even among therapists who don\u2019t necessarily intend to use them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never read the book, but couples will refer to it in sessions,\u201d said Avi Klein, a psychotherapist with a couples therapy practice in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s a vehicle for people to communicate about yourself to someone else. It\u2019s a way to ask for what you need. I think people try to use the love languages in a positive way.\u201d\n\nAll of Chapman\u2019s 5 Love Languages media\u2014the purple-covered book that started it all in \u201892, the email newsletters, and his many subsequent books\u2014take for granted that once we\u2019ve learned our partner\u2019s love language, we will work hard to learn how to speak it. The underlying assumption is that a little love language elbow grease is all it takes to keep a long-term relationship running smoothly. And, more importantly, Chapman seems to believe that speaking your partner\u2019s love language can solve almost any problem. \u201cYou can\u2019t make someone want to speak your love language,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best you can do is try to speak theirs, and hope it softens their heart.\u201d In most cases this seems reasonable\u2014is a little more quality time, or a few more words of affirmation, ever too much to ask?\n\nThe book starts to feel a little weaselly when it gets into the love language of \u201cphysical touch.\u201d In a book with religious overtones, \u201cphysical touch\u201d seems like the closest stand-in for the role of sex in a relationship, a way of shying from taking about sex directly but nonetheless highlighting it as important. Sex is much more complex than complimenting and and gift-giving.\n\nBut sex, Chapman argues, isn\u2019t necessarily part of the love language of physical touch. \u201cLet\u2019s not equate the love language of physical touch with sexual intercourse,\u201d Chapman said when I brought this up. \u201cWhen I meet people who tell me their love language is physical touch, I might ask them, \u2018Do non-sexual touches make you feel loved? Let's say your wife takes your hand while you\u2019re walking across the parking lot from the car to the mall. Or how about, she puts her hand on your shoulder while she\u2019s pouring you a cup of coffee.' If these forms of touch, which are loving but not sexual in nature, don\u2019t make you feel loved\u2014then physical touch is not your love language! People who like sex\u2014that\u2019s not necessarily their love language.\u201d\n\nChapman\u2019s religious background asserts itself through what it omits rather than what it states. Sexual preferences, according to Chapman\u2019s worldview, are not necessarily relevant to expressing and receiving love. \u201cComing up with new ways and places to touch can be an exciting challenge,\u201d writes Chapman in the chapter on physical touch. \u201cIf you have not been an \u2018under-the-table-toucher,\u2019 you might find that it will add a spark to your dining out.\u201d Chapman goes on from here to suggest all kinds of touching, none of which are the kind that happen in private. It feels a bit like taking a sex ed workshop with Ned Flanders.\n\nSome readers might have to go off-piste from Love Langauges doctrine here, either by considering physical touch inclusive of sex, or by thinking of sex as something that happens as part of other love languages, like quality time or even, let\u2019s be honest, acts of service. It\u2019s a reasonable extension of the overall philosophy, but Chapman never mentions sex directly in any of these respects. The elision of sex is the book\u2019s unignorable flaw; how can sex be separate from other expressions of love?\n\n\u201cOur sexuality is so bound up with who we are,\u201d said Klein. \u201cI don\u2019t think that most men are particularly connected to their sexuality. People talk about sex as if it\u2019s an act rather than a form of intimacy and a way of being known...I do think people would be so much better off if there were \u2018sexual love languages.\u2019 So many people would be better off learning about themselves and their sexuality, and how much better would people\u2019s sex lives be if they could like, name a way that they wanted to be related to sexually?\u201d\n\nEven third-party experts aren\u2019t necessarily aligned on where sex fits in. \u201cI consider sexual intimacy to be included in the love language of physical touch,\u201d said Leslie Bartlett, a licensed clinical professional counselor who works exclusively with couples in Brunswick, Maine. \u201cI think we should honor Gary. What he has done is profound. He\u2019s offered a way of looking at couples\u2019 fundamental misunderstandings in a way that can shine a light and allow these misunderstandings to be softened. And of course there\u2019s more! There\u2019s always more, there\u2019s always deeper. But he took a beautiful step into a journey that needed to be examined.\u201d\n\nWhile secular people might find the Love Languages\u2019 subtle Christianity off-putting, a growing minority of devout Christians find it too secular. The evangelical blogosphere in particular contains plenty of polite detractors. Dell Canright, a marriage counselor who runs Christian Counseling in Mansfield, Texas, has found that, sometimes, the love languages can encourage selfishness between couples.\n\nHe reminds us that humans have a fundamental need to feel loved, but frames this as an opportunity rather than the reason that all humans stagger through most of life suffering.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that Dr. Chapman intended this, but the love languages can resonate with our selfish parts. [The book] can encourage couples to say, \u2018You know what my needs are\u2014why won\u2019t you give me that?\u2019 As opposed to learning what kind of love your wife or husband needs. I\u2019m not opposed to the idea of the love languages\u2014and I think Dr. Chapman\u2019s done a great job of identifying some simple ways that we like to receive love. But I know that most of the clients I meet start out using the love languages in a selfish way as opposed to in a loving way to minister to their spouse.\u201d\n\nCanright, also a Baptist, situates Love Languages within an \u201cintegrationist\u201d approach to psychology\u2014which takes basic tenets of human psychology, and occasionally integrates religious scripture into its practice. Canright himself practices what is known as \u201cBiblical counseling,\u201d which takes a more fundamentalist approach to applying scripture to everyday life.\n\n\u201cThe integrationist approach is based on the idea that man is good, and he needs to have good self-esteem to be happy. The Biblical approach to counseling believes that man is God\u2019s enemy. Man\u2019s greatest need is to be reconciled to God. Life is not about me. It\u2019s about Christ living in me and through me.\u201d\n\nChapman\u2019s integrationist approach doesn\u2019t hold much appeal to Baptist counselors like Canright, who prefer to use Biblical scripture as a strict guidebook rather than a set of general suggestions. Chapman\u2019s influence, however, can\u2019t be denied, even by those who disagree with him. \u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t critique [Chapman],\u201d said Canright. \u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t in any way disparage or think critically about the book because of the reputation that Dr. Chapman has.\u201d\n\nAdvice sent via the Love Languages email list\n\nThe original Love Languages\u2014which remains by far Chapman's biggest hit\u2014has stayed more or less the same since 1992, through numerous reissues. \u201cNot much has changed,\u201d claimed Chapman, even with prevalence of dating apps. \u201cPeople who meet online, once they\u2019re together, the situation is the same as if you met any other way. You still have a fundamental need to feel loved.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Gary Chapman may have written the definitive couples self-help guide of our time; no other book seems to be threatening its dominance in terms of influence and sales. He reminds us that humans have a fundamental need to feel loved, but frames this as an opportunity rather than the reason that all humans stagger through most of life suffering. To feel unloved is to be wretched. To demand love is humiliating. Love itself is often not cute. Chapman diverts our attention away from the wretchedness that we all fear, and the humiliation we all know, and normalizes the act of asking others for things we need.\n\nThe love languages stand as a protective barrier between ourselves and the painful reality of our emotional needs. In this way, they transcend their Christian origins. The feeling of being unloved is what drives consumer capitalism; most of us are taught to think that maybe this time, with this new configuration of objects and experiences, things will be different. In suggesting that we look inward for the cause of this hunger, Chapman\u2019s as much a Buddhist as he is a Christian.\n\nSay what you will about Chapman\u2019s anachronistic wholesomeness or the intellectual poverty of reducing yourself to a type, the love languages have good bones. They encourage us to satisfy our need for love by asking for more love\u2014not with more adventures, or a more inflated sense of our own holiness, or a different partner, or a remodeled kitchen, or a new hobby. We are stuck with ourselves; our needs don\u2019t change much over time. The love languages suggest, gently, that we should stop changing the subject and be honest about what we really want.\n\nHumans as a species are addicted to deluding ourselves. We are desperate for someone to convince us that things are better or easier or sexier than they really are\u2014just ask me in 2003, lying in bed with my bronchial infection and my romantic hallucinations. But the love languages are dedicated to peeling off artifice rather than applying more. They don\u2019t trade on our gullibility or our eternal optimism. We can\u2019t resist the narcissistic mantras of self-improvement that fill so much of today\u2019s self-help literature. But Gary Chapman (and the Moody Bible Institute's tax receipts) would argue that even more than that, we can\u2019t resist feeling loved. What a surprisingly heartening thought.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Kathryn Jezer-Morton on Twitter.", "description": "The quietly Baptist self-help book has broken its own sales records almost every year since it was published in 1992.
