The FRC is considering additional investigations into Thomas Cook, it said.\n\nEY had been Thomas Cook\u2019s auditor since 2017, a spokeswoman for the professional services firm said. From 2006 to 2016, Thomas Cook\u2019s financial statements were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a spokesman for PwC said.\n\nThomas Cook, Britain\u2019s oldest travel company, went out of business in the early hours of Sept. 23 following the breakdown of emergency talks between its banks, bondholders and its biggest shareholder, Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. The travel company had been struggling with a decline in tour and flight bookings, higher fuel prices and uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s planned departure from the European Union. The rescue deal would have seen an injection of \u00a3900 million ($1.1 billion) into the company. It failed after Thomas Cook\u2019s creditors demanded an additional \u00a3200 million stand-by facility to cover the coming winter season. EY said it will be fully cooperating with the FRC but declined to comment further. The firm in its review of Thomas Cook\u2019s half-year results in May stated that there was material uncertainty surrounding the business, casting doubt about Thomas Cook\u2019s ability to continue operating for another year. Tuesday\u2019s announcement comes as the FRC is stepping up its enforcement efforts amid growing concerns about the quality of work provided by Britain\u2019s largest audit firms. As part of these measures, the regulator on Monday tightened a key accounting rule used to assess a company\u2019s health.
