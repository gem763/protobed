According to the survey, exactly half of Gen Xers have a retirement savings account, though only 36% are actively saving. A slightly larger share of millennials have a retirement account (54%), but only about 41% are contributing to it.\n\nBut retirement needs differ for everyone and respondents didn't disclose how much they're saving. Some may feel like it's less than they should be saving to achieve their goals.\n\nPlus, retirement savings is only one aspect of our larger financial picture. It's possible the survey respondents who don't feel good financially still have low-interest debt to pay off, but are contributing to their retirement plan to score a match or take advantage of time in the market \u2014 a wise move, according to most financial planners.\n\nBut among the respondents who have paid off credit-card debt, one-third still think their financial health is not very good or not good at all, the survey found. Of respondents who have paid off a student loan, 32% still said their financial health is bad.\n\nThe survey findings also underscored that a high salary doesn't automatically signal financial stability \u2014 in fact, income has little to do with how well a person is doing by traditional financial markers. Of the survey respondents who earn more than $100,000 a year, 18% still think their financial health is bad.\n\nStill, the survey found that millennials in particular are positive when it comes to peer comparison \u2014 46% think they're much better or somewhat better off than others their age (the remaining 17% said they didn't know).\n\nThis all goes to show that between retirement savings, debt, and income, there are several factors contributing to a healthy financial life \u2014 or at least, the perception of one.\n\nCheck back on \"The State of Our Money\" throughout the month for more findings and analysis.", "description": "Between retirement savings, debt, and income, there are several factors contributing to a healthy financial life \u2014 or at least, the perception of one.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db87823dee01919896fddd8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
