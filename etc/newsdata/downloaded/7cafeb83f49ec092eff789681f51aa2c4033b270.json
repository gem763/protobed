He is pictured in a mugshot (left) and being interviewed in January 2016 (right)\n\nBut he said officers may have been 'in a state of panic' over a letter sent by the Labour deputy leader on House of Commons notepaper. Scotland Yard said the force was not aware of the letter at the time a review of the case was conducted.\n\nThe report said: 'There can be no doubt that Tom Watson believed 'Nick' and it should be stated that he had previously provided the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) with information leading to convictions in other cases.\n\nFull statement from Tom Watson today 'It is unfortunate that this review, which contains multiple inaccuracies regarding myself, has been selectively leaked, seemingly to refocus criticism away from the Metropolitan Police. 'The report doesn't make clear the key point that Lord Brittan was interviewed by the police before they received my letter. 'Ex-director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders publicly confirmed that my letter was not received by police until after the interview. 'It therefore cannot be argued that it was pressure from me that led to Lord Brittan being interviewed. 'I have always said that it wasn't my place to judge whether sexual abuse allegations were true or false \u2013 that was for the police. 'The police asked me to encourage the hundreds of people that came to me with stories of child abuse to report their stories to the police. That is what I did.'\n\n'His interest, however, in both Operation Midland and Operation Vincente created further pressure upon MPS officers.'\n\nSir Richard also said that the main cause of the Metropolitan Police's disastrous probe was 'poor judgment and a failure to accurately evaluate known facts'.\n\nHe added that a 'major contributing factor was the culture that 'victims' must be believed' in his findings, more of which were published by the force today.\n\nSir Richard, whose report released today runs to 391 pages, was called in after 16-month Operation Midland ended in 2016 without a single arrest.\n\nThe investigation saw the homes of D-Day veteran Lord Bramall, Lord Brittan's widow Lady Diana Brittan and ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor raided on the basis of Beech's false claims.\n\nThe force published the findings into Operation Vincente - the investigation into an allegation that Lord Brittan had raped a 19-year-old woman in 1967 - for the first time today.\n\nA list of priorities drawn up by one of the investigating officers included 'Tom Watson - review how we can engage with him'.\n\nSir Richard wrote: 'I have concluded that the errors in this investigation were largely attributable to the fact that Lord Brittan was a prominent person and there was a desire amongst senior officers to reassure the public that if they come forward the police will investigate a complaint thoroughly no matter whom the allegation is against.\n\nMetropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve House (pictured outside New Scotland Yard in London today) was questioned about Mr Watson's role in pressuring police\n\n'I have concluded also that investigating officers were fearful of media criticism and public cynicism and sought protection from it by the Crown Prosecution Service.'\n\nThe report said officers tried to persuade the CPS to give pre-charge advice three times, and on each occasion the case should have been dropped.\n\n'The officers responsible were under a positive duty to make a decision themselves and failed to do so,' Sir Richard wrote.\n\nLord Brittan died aged 75 before he was publicly cleared of the allegation. He was also a suspect in Operation Midland, which centred around Beech's false claims.\n\nDaniel Janner, the son of the late Labour MP Lord Janner who was one of Beech's victims, accused Mr Watson of being 'partially responsible'.\n\nIn October 2012 (pictured), Mr Watson repeated Beech's false claims of a 'powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10', of which police later found no evidence\n\nHe claimed Mr Watson - who raised the matter in Parliament after speaking to Beech - 'applied pressure on the police and should hang his head in shame and resign'.\n\nCalls for judge-led inquiry into how police handled Beech claims Calls have been made for a judge-led inquiry after claims the Operation Midland 'scandal appears to be going to the top of the Met'. Daniel Janner, the son of the late Labour MP Lord Janner who was one of Carl Beech's victims, claimed that asking a police watchdog to review the force was 'wholly inadequate'. He said in a statement: 'The police were taken in hook line and sinker by patently absurd allegations. 'Carl Beech's allegation that my late father, a Labour MP, raped him in the Conservative Carlton club together with senior conservative politicians, was as hateful as it was ludicrous. 'It is an absolute disgrace that the police failed to take any steps to verify the allegation and described Beech's allegations as credible and true. 'This scandal which goes to the very top of the police cries out for a full judicial inquiry to restore faith in the criminal justice system. 'A reference to HM Inspector of Constabulary is wholly inadequate. The law needs to be reformed to provide for anonymity for suspects in sexual offences until charge.' Mr Janner is the founder of Falsely Accused Individuals for Reform (Fair), a pressure group campaigning for changes in the law. Singer Sir Cliff Richard and DJ Paul Gambaccini are supporting the campaign which seeks to 'redress the balance' in the legal system by calling for those accused of sexual offences remain anonymous until charged.\n\nAfter the report's release today, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve House was asked about Mr Watson's role in pressuring police.\n\nHe said: 'I won't refer directly to Tom Watson, I think you would have to speak to him more about that.\n\n'But I think it's quite clear at the time of this there was a significant amount of pressure on a lot of different public bodies in relation to not taking seriously allegations around this sort of assault.\n\n'That does not excuse the mistakes that we made in these circumstances but I think it explains some of what went on and some of the thinking that we had, and it goes back to the issues of belief, I think.'\n\nBut Mr Watson said: 'The report doesn't make clear the key point that Lord Brittan was interviewed by the police before they received my letter.\n\n'Former Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Steve) Rodhouse has been clear that the letter did not influence the investigation, and ex-Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders publicly confirmed that my letter was not received by Police until after the interview.\n\n'It therefore cannot be argued that it was pressure from me that led to Lord Brittan being interviewed.'\n\nMr Rodhouse, who is now a senior director at the National Crime Agency, was referred to the police watchdog over the inquiry, but the body did not take it on as an investigation.\n\nHe said: 'My decision-making on Operation Vincente was driven by the need to ensure that the public could have confidence that the MPS had thoroughly investigated the allegation made against Lord Brittan.\n\n'This was important in light of the many allegations that the police had historically overlooked, made against prominent public figures.'", "description": "Former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques said there was 'no doubt' that Labour deputy leader Tom Watson believed the allegations by fantasist Carl Beech, known as 'Nick'.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19303816-0-image-a-91_1570203403446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
