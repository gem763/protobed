For years she was the only female farmer in southern Mato Grosso state, Brazil\u2019s soy country. Now she speaks to thousands of women hoping to break into the country\u2019s $300 billion, male-dominated agricultural industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBrazil is a global agricultural powerhouse, the world\u2019s top producer of soy, coffee, beef and oranges. But its traditionally machista culture has long kept women out of the industry.\n\nThat\u2019s starting to change. A record 31 percent of farms in Brazil are managed by women today, triple the number in 2013, according to Brazil\u2019s Agribusiness Association.\n\nFemale farmers say they still have a tougher time than their male competitors accessing training and credit, and they suffer high rates of violence and discrimination. Now, they\u2019re banding together to try to bridge the gap.\n\nKnown as Brazil\u2019s \u201ccattle queens,\u201d they gather once a year to discuss a range of subjects: workplace harassment, technological advances, macroeconomic policy. The meeting has grown from a few hundred women in 2016 to a sold-out event of 2,000 this month at a Sao Paulo conference center sponsored by major agricultural companies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSurrounded by pink tractors and orchids, they attended lectures on the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on soy prices, and sustainability in agriculture.\n\nKelly Andrade, a 38-year-old grain farmer from Minas Gerais state, says she came to be inspired by women who have succeeded in a man\u2019s world.\n\n\u201cIt can sometimes be isolating to work in your corner of Brazil and you don\u2019t know what is happening in the rest of the country,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is great to exchange information, learn what other women are trying in their farms, what is working and not working for them.\u201d\n\nWhen Andrade first started working on her father\u2019s farms, she says, banks would call him to check whether she had his permission to secure loans.\n\nAD\n\nSuch experiences are not uncommon. Corteva, an American agricultural company, surveyed female farmers around the world last year. Nearly 80 percent of Brazilian women reported having experienced discrimination, compared to 52 percent of their American counterparts.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou have to learn to deal with discrimination, to be respected and have a voice,\u201d Andrade said.\n\nWomen from conservative areas of the country say the meeting was the first time they have been able to put the discrimination into words. Rosemeire Santos, 47, a Corteva executive in Brasilia, launched a year-long training program last year on entre\u00adpre\u00adneur\u00adship and female empowerment for 20 up-and-coming farmers. At first, she says, none of the women admitted to having suffered discrimination. But by the end of the course, several did.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWomen are not ready to talk about discrimination in agribusiness,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are used to seeing their situation as standard.\u201d\n\nAs the number of women in the industry grow, they also face growing rates of violence. Last year, 482 women were victims of violence in rural conflicts in Brazil, four times the number in 2017.\n\nAD\n\nLawyer Ticiane Figueiredo is the author of \u201cAgro Women,\u201d a book on female farmers in Brazil.\n\n\u201cWhen you are demanding gender equality in what has traditionally been a masculine space, men get threatened and think that we are trying to destroy them. But they need to support that effort,\u201d she says. \u201cSince men are still the ones in a position of power, if they don\u2019t let us in, we won\u2019t break the glass ceiling.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nConference regulars say it has given them a community they can rely on year-round. They stay connected through group texts and emails, where they share legal advice, information about prices and new farming technology. When times are tough or crops are not performing as expected, they offer each other emotional support.\n\nKiara Motter, a 31-year-old from northern Brazil, went looking for an extra push of encouragement as she gets ready to take over her family\u2019s grain farm.\n\nAD", "description": "The \u201ccattle queens,\u201d now a third of the nation\u2019s farmers, meet up to help each other break into the machista world of agriculture.", "authors": ["Marina Lopes"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7XX8_V_WCdnbuoE2ZEJXlJYXUEs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IGB6PZHLQMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
