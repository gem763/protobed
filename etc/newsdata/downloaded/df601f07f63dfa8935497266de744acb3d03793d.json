Even if you find a partner, how do you know he or she is really right for you?\n\nWhich is where \u201cthe radical new social experiment\u201d of \u201cSingletown\u201d comes in, from Britain\u2019s ITV, the broadcaster that brought the world \u201cLove Island\u201d.\n\nIn it, couples are put to the test, breaking up for a trial separation where they will live like singletons for a week in a luxury apartment, being introduced to a procession of tempting suitors.\n\nWith the shackles off, they are encouraged to let their hair down.\n\nThey will also be able to watch how their \u201cexes\u201d are getting on with their dates \u2014 nextdoor.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the week they are brought together and they must decide whether their old relationship\u201d was the \u201creal thing\u201d or whether they will have a flutter with a new partner.", "description": "Cannes (France) (AFP) \u2013 Women have never had the stakes stacked more in their favour in the television dating game, with a plethora of new shows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/25f4b5_in-singleton-women-decide-current-partner-is-real-or-flutter-new-one-men-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
