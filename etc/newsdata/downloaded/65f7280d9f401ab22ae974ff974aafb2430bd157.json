I said they\u2019re going to have to fight a little while,\u201d Trump told a rally of supporters in Texas.\n\n\u201cLike two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.\n\n\u201cThey fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious.\u201d\n\nTrump triggered the week-long Turkish offensive against the Kurds by withdrawing US troops from northeast Syria.\n\nMore than 500 people have been killed including dozens of civilians, mostly on the Kurdish side, and 300,000 civilians have been displaced within Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.\n\nTrump stressed that \u201cnot one drop of American blood\u201d was shed.\n\nOn Thursday, Turkey \u2014 after talks with US Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 agreed to suspend its offensive and to end the assault if Kurdish-led forces withdraw from a safe zone along the border.\n\n\u201cWe went there and we said we want a pause, and the Kurds have been terrific. They\u2019re going to move back a little bit,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep ISIS (the Islamic State group) nice and locked up. We are going to find more of them, and Turkey is all set.\u201d\n\nTrump has faced accusations even from usually loyal supporters that his withdrawal of 1,000 US troops betrayed Kurdish militants who bore the brunt of the fight against Islamic State in recent years.\n\nBrett McGurk, former presidential special envoy for the anti-IS coalition, described Trump\u2019s remarks about \u201ctwo kids\u201d fighting as \u201cobscene and ignorant.\u201d\n\n\u201c200k innocent people displaced. Hundreds dead. Credible reports of war crimes. ISIS prisoners escaping. US evacuating and bombing its own positions or handing them to Russia. Two kids in a lot?\u201d he said on Twitter.", "description": "Dallas (AFP) \u2013 US President Donald Trump said Thursday that he allowed Turkish and Kurdish forces to clash in deadly battle because the two sides", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/c5f3ba_donald-trump-turkey-kurds-needed-fight-two-kids-trump-turkey-kurds-needed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
