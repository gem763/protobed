Khairullah is pictured with his daughter, Ahid.

Last week, a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the watchlist is unconstitutional.\n\nA U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson, who declined to be identified, said he could not address any individual case because of the federal Privacy Act but said the agency \u201ctreats all international travelers with integrity, respect and professionalism while keeping the highest standards of security.\u201d\n\n'Stereotyping of Muslims and Arabs'\n\nKhairullah, his wife and four children, ages 1, 2, 9 and 10, visited relatives in Turkey who are Syrians displaced by war.

During the screening, he said, they asked him what he studied in college, where he works, his mother\u2019s name, his nicknames and where he traveled.\n\nKhairullah said they asked whether he'd visited any towns with terrorist cells and whether he personally met with any terrorists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s flat-out insulting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s flat-out stereotyping of Muslims and Arabs.\u201d\n\nAt the agents\u2019 request, he said, he gave them access to his phone, which contained private emails and family photos, among other information. The phone was taken to another room. Khairullah said he called an attorney as he grew increasingly uncomfortable and said he no longer consented to the search of his phone.\n\nMayor Mohamed Khairullah has four children, including Abdullah and Ahid. More\n\nAgents told him they\u2019d have to keep the phone, Khairullah said. They held it for 12 days until a lawyer from the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations intervened and helped get it back.\n\nKhairullah\u2019s family fled persecution in Syria in 1980 and lived in Saudi Arabia before moving to the USA in 1991 when he was a teenager.
