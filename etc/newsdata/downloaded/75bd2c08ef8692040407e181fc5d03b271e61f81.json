But that has to be winnowed down to a compelling case,\u201d said Representative Gerry Connolly of Virginia, a Democrat who came out in support of impeachment proceedings last month.\n\nRepublicans have characterized the Democratic investigations as a fishing expedition undertaken by a party disappointed by the conclusions of the Mueller report and the former special counsel\u2019s underwhelming performance during his testimony before Congress in July. \u201cTheir first effort at impeachment seems not to have worked. So now they\u2019re looking for another path to impeachment,\u201d Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican in the House, told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday. \u201cThey have been determined to impeach this president at all costs since he was elected regardless of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Democrats do not take the GOP critique seriously. \u201cGive me a break,\u201d Raskin said in an interview. \u201cThe only reason we're dealing with a profusion of investigations is because we're dealing with such a profusion of crimes. It just never ends with Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nYet lawmakers who have not come out for impeachment remain concerned that the party, in its zeal to respond to activists seeking a confrontation with the president, will conflate issues that represent mere policy differences with crimes that warrant investigation. \u201cThere are a lot of people unhappy with a lot of the things that the president is doing, and they'd like to sort of put them all in a basket and deal with it by way of impeachment,\u201d Representative Susan Wild of Pennsylvania told reporters after a town hall in her district last month. The Democrat has said she is \u201cnot there yet\u201d on impeachment. \u201cI tend to be fairly pragmatic and process-oriented, and a lot of the things that people are unhappy with are not necessarily impeachable offenses, you know?\u201d she added.\n\nRead: The impeachment summer that wasn\u2019t\n\nFor now, the main debate among pro-impeachment Democrats seems to be whether there\u2019s a stronger case in the president\u2019s alleged corruption and violation of the emoluments clause, or whether the Mueller report still provides the best and most obvious evidence of impeachable offenses.\n\n\u201cI think the gravest concern we all ought to have is his bromance with Vladimir Putin, his attempt to truncate an ongoing criminal investigation of Russian interference with the election,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cThat is very serious business.\n\n\u201cI don't think we're limited to the Mueller report, but the Mueller report\u2014and Mueller himself virtually said so\u2014is a roadmap to impeachment,\u201d he added.\n\nOther lawmakers said that while they find the obstruction allegations against the president to be both powerful and impeachable, the examples of Trump\u2019s profiting off the presidency are occurring in public view and, therefore, make for an easier sell to Americans. There\u2019s \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d against Trump in Mueller\u2019s findings, but the emoluments violations constitute \u201ccorruption, plain and simple,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island. Unlike many of the allegations in the Mueller report, the Democrat added, \u201cthese are areas where the public has actually seen the conduct that is the subject of the investigation. They've seen the president engage in conduct in which he's clearly benefiting himself and his family, so it's done in plain view.\u201d", "description": "The lawmakers who most want to oust President Trump don\u2019t agree on what the party\u2019s strongest case against him is.", "authors": ["Russell Berman", "Elaine Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19207563547689/facebook.jpg?1568216393", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
