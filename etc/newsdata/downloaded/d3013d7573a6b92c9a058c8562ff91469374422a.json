He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in June and presented his credentials at the European Commission in July.\n\nAccording to text messages released by House committee leaders last week, Sondland was heavily involved in contacts with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as he sought a meeting with Trump, and Ukrainian officials expressed concern at the administration\u2019s decision to block nearly $400 million in U.S. military assistance for Kiev.\n\nIn one of the texts, for example, Sondland emphasized that Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable.\u201d\n\nCharges that Trump pressured Zelenskiy in a July 25 telephone call to investigate Biden, a leading rival in Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election bid, while withholding the military aid, helped prompt House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment investigation last month.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nConcerns about the call, and possible Trump threats to Ukraine, came to the attention of Congress in a report by a whistleblower. On Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate that complaint.\n\nPOLITICAL APPOINTEE\n\nSondland\u2019s appearance marks a shift for the investigation because he is a Trump donor and political appointee. Previous witnesses have been career officials, including the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the U.S. Intelligence Community.\n\nAnother career diplomat, Marie Yovanovitch, will meet with the committees behind closed doors on Friday. Yovanovitch was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until Trump recalled her in May before her term was up, after Trump supporters questioned her loyalty.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry has heightened bitter partisan divides in Congress, where Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate and Democrats have a majority in the House.\n\nTrump has reacted furiously to the inquiry, using obscenities and insulting nicknames for Democratic lawmakers in posts on Twitter. Administration officials - and some Republican allies in Congress - have questioned whether they have any obligation to cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nThe White House was expected to tell Pelosi this week that it would ignore lawmakers\u2019 demands for documents until the House holds a vote to approve the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi says a vote is not needed, although Democrats say the House would back the inquiry if there were a vote.\n\nTuesday\u2019s committee meeting with Sondland was to begin at 9:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT) and could last for hours. Volker was interviewed on Thursday for more than eight hours by House members and staff.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks about the U.S. House impeachment investigation during a formal signing ceremony for the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement at the White House in Washington, October 7, 2019.
