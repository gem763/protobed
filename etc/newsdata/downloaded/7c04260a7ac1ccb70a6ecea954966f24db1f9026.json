All the decisions evinced serious doubts about the media\u2019s actions.\n\nLast month, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived a lawsuit against The Times by Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and former governor of Alaska. Palin complained that a Times editorial published in 2017 inaccurately linked her to the 2011 shooting rampage in Arizona that gravely wounded then-Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The appeals judges said Palin should have the right to issue subpoenas for records and demand testimony to prove her case.\n\n2nd Circuit Judge John Walker said the district judge was wrong to reject \u201ca permissible inference\u201d that Bennet \u2014 and, by extension, The Times \u2014 intentionally lied by asserting Palin\u2019s connection to the shooting.\n\nThe following day, a federal District Court judge in Texas dealt a blow to NPR by rejecting the network\u2019s motion to throw out a $57 million lawsuit challenging its reporting about efforts by a conservative investor, Ed Butowsky, to stir up interest in the death of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, and the unsubstantiated possibility that he leaked Democratic emails to WikiLeaks.\n\nIn ordering that Butowsky\u2019s suit proceed to the fact-finding process, Judge Amos Mazzant said the NPR reports implied \u201cwrongdoing\u201d by the investor and were not protected by privileges for reporting on public legal filings.\n\nAnd earlier this month, the 2nd Circuit struck again, with a different panel of the same court breathing new life into a suit that Rich\u2019s parents brought against Fox News alleging that the network conspired with Butowsky to concoct and publish false reports that their son had dealings with WikiLeaks. In another unanimous ruling, the three judges said the case easily met the standard for plausibility \u2014 even though it also claims that a major news outlet deliberately published lies.\n\n\u201cWe have no trouble concluding that \u2014 taking their allegations as true \u2014 the Riches plausibly alleged what amounted to a campaign of emotional torture,\u201d Judge Guido Calabresi wrote.\n\nSome First Amendment advocates and scholars have downplayed the decisions. They note that news organizations have also posted some notable wins in the past year or so, with two different judges ruling against the Trump White House\u2019s efforts to strip credentials from CNN reporter Jim Acosta and Playboy correspondent Brian Karem.\n\nBuzzFeed also scored a victory last December in a libel suit brought by a Russian internet entrepreneur who claimed that he was defamed by the online news outlet\u2019s publication of the so-called Trump dossier about purported ties between Trump and Russia. And in July, the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a strongly pro-press ruling , dismissing a libel case against The New York Times filed by an Ohio State University cancer researcher.\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N.

But opening the cases to what could be protracted document production and depositions could cost the news organizations hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in legal bills, even if they ultimately prevail.\n\nThe adverse rulings for the media outlets were particularly troubling to some press advocates who were already seeing legal storm clouds gathering on the horizon.\n\nOne such ominous sign came in February as Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the Supreme Court should revisit the bedrock of American libel law: the court\u2019s 1964 ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan. The ruling established the \u201cactual malice\u201c standard, making it very difficult for public figures to prevail in defamation cases.\n\nThomas, a conservative appointee of President George H.W. Bush, devoted a 14-page concurrence to denouncing the landmark decision as a disturbing example of \u201cpolicy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe States are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm,\u201d Thomas wrote.\n\nThomas\u2019s opinion echoed calls that Donald Trump has issued for years for major changes to libel law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to open up libel laws, and we\u2019re going to have people sue you like you\u2019ve never got sued before,\u201d Trump said to reporters on the campaign trail in February 2016 as he railed against coverage of his presidential bid.\n\nLast year, the president promised a \u201cstrong look\u201d at overhauling libel laws, but there has been little sign of traction on that front. One challenge is that states set defamation law, within the constitutional framework the Supreme Court has laid out.\n\nHowever, Trump has kept up the public drumbeat in favor of more suits against the media. Just in the last few days, he has repeatedly urged Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to sue The Times over an article that contained a new allegation against him of inappropriate sexual conduct at Yale decades ago, but initially failed to note that friends of the woman said to be involved have said she does not recall it. The Times later added that detail, and appended an editor\u2018s note pointing out the revision.\n\n\u201cBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue,\u201d Trump tweeted last week. \u201cThe lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination.\u201d\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s open hostility toward journalists and what he calls \u201cfake news,\u201d most of his judicial appointees are viewed as staunch First Amendment defenders. The decision reinstating the press pass the Trump White House seized from CNN\u2019s Acosta last year was issued by Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee.\n\nWhether partisan or ideological biases may be at work in the recent media setbacks is hard to discern.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/1127/1155968404_6049740697001_6049745823001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nMazzant, the judge who ruled against NPR, is an Obama appointee. However, he\u2019s a Republican who got his nomination as part of a deal the Obama White House brokered in 2014 with GOP Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas. In recent years, Mazzant has been sought out by conservatives seeking to challenge Obama-era policies.\n\nWalker, who wrote the opinion reinstating Palin\u2019s suit, is an appointee \u2014 and first cousin \u2014 of the first President Bush. The other judges on that panel were Denny Chin, an Obama appointee, and John Keenan, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan.\n\nCalabresi, who authored the ruling reviving the suit against Fox, is an appointee of President Bill Clinton. He\u2019s a well-respected jurist who once served as dean of Yale Law School, but he landed in hot water in 2004 for public remarks he made advocating President George W. Bush\u2019s defeat and comparing him to Mussolini. Calabresi apologized and was reprimanded by his colleagues.\n\nThe judges joining Calabresi in the Fox decision two weeks ago were Christopher Droney, an Obama appointee, and Stefan Underhill, a Clinton appointee.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good thing,\u201d Kirtley, the Minnesota law professor, said of the new appeals court decisions. \u201cThe 2nd Circuit has generally been pretty favorable to the media.\u201d\n\nThe recent setbacks are notable because the upper hand the media gained in libel litigation as a result of the Sullivan decision a half-century ago grew even more pronounced in the past couple of decades as nearly 30 states passed statutes to discourage the filing of weak or meritless defamation cases related to debates on public issues.\n\nThe so-called anti-SLAPP laws \u2014 aimed at cracking down on what critics billed as \u201cstrategic lawsuits against public participation\u201d \u2014 gave news outlets new options to shut down suits quickly and to discourage plaintiffs from filing in the first place because of the threat of having to pay the opposing side\u2019s legal fees.\n\nSome prominent First Amendment lawyers say that while aspects of the recent rulings are troubling, it is too soon to declare that the courts are becoming decidedly more hostile to the press.\n\n\u201cThe days of the journalist as romantic hero are long over,\u201d Floyd Abrams, the veteran press defender, told POLITICO.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that there was a time in the 1970s and for some years thereafter \u2026 when we did seem to win all our cases and journalists were atop all sorts of prestige lists,\u201d added Abrams, who filed an amicus brief backing The Times in the Palin appeal. \u201cWe might have won then some of the motions that we\u2019ve recently lost. But the law remains, at its core, favorable and it\u2019s not \u2014 certainly not yet \u2014 a time for concern.\u201d", "description": "Some legal experts view the rulings as signs that the courts\u2019 view of the media is beginning to change.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/57/dc/a769c7c046169be9345ed71e68f9/20190923-npr-building-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
