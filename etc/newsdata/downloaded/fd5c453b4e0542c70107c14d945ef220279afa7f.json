Neither side will yield to the other. The impossible Brexit culture war rolls endlessly on.\n\nBut there are nevertheless some facts that neither side is able to contest. The UK now has a prime minister who asks to be hidden from the Luxembourg public. A prime minister that still likes to claim that Brexit does not represent a retreat from the global stage \u2013 quite the opposite in fact \u2013 but who is, nevertheless, a hate figure all over Europe.\n\nThree years ago, that a British prime minister would be unable to hold a public press conference in Luxembourg for fear of public reaction would not be merely unthinkable but actually laughable.\n\nThat there would have to be diplomatic back-channelling going on to spare the prime minister\u2019s blushes after a lunch in Luxembourg is a reality that has only very recently become imaginable.\n\nLast summer, the UK government went to great lengths to stage a visit from Donald Trump, without the president having to go anywhere near where a protester might be. Theresa May held a press conference in the garden at Chequers, the first time such a thing has happened.\n\nBritain did its bit for a friend and ally. But when Theresa May did so, she was rightly criticised for stymieing the British public\u2019s right to protest, for providing a hermetically sealed environment for an internationally loathed public figure who perhaps did not deserve it.\n\nNow the UK is another such nation, led by another such figure. Boris Johnson expects countries he visits to go to great lengths to shield him from the revulsion of the international community which he has done everything to earn.\n\nIf other countries don\u2019t feel compelled to censor their own people, to shut down their own streets, that is their choice. They are not responsible for Boris Johnson\u2019s actions. It is not their responsibility to hide him from his own hatred.", "description": "Inevitably, it took a matter of seconds for the two tales of Boris Johnson\u2019s no-show press conference in Luxembourg to take hold.
