That request comes two days after lawmakers voted to delay approving the deal.\n\nBut House of Commons Speaker John Bercow could refuse to allow such a vote because parliamentary rules generally bar the same measure from being considered a second time during the same session of Parliament unless something has changed.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative government will also introduce the legislation necessary to implement the Brexit agreement it struck with the EU last week, opening the door to potentially lengthy debates or amendments that could scuttle the deal.\n\nWith the Brexit deadline looming and British politicians still squabbling over the country\u2019s departure terms from the bloc, Johnson has been forced to ask the EU for a three-month delay to the departure date.\n\nHe did that,\u2019 grudgingly, to comply with a law passed by Parliament ordering the government to postpone Brexit rather than risk the economic damage that could come from a no-deal exit.\n\nBut Johnson accompanied the letter to the EU, sent late Saturday, with a second note saying that he personally opposed delaying the U.K.\u2019s Oct. 31 exit.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said he would consult EU leaders on how to respond to the request. The other 27 EU members are weary of the long-running Brexit saga, but also want to avoid a no-deal British exit, which would damage economies on both sides of the Channel.\n\nGermany\u2019s economy minister suggested it could be a few days before the EU decided to respond to the Brexit delay request.\n\n\u201cWe will have somewhat more clarity in the coming days, and we will then exercise our responsibility and quickly make a decision,\u201d Germany\u2019s Peter Altmaier said.\n\nHe told Deutschlandfunk radio that he wouldn\u2019t have a problem with an extension by \u201ca few days or a few weeks\u201d if that rules out a no-deal Brexit.\n\nBut French President Emmanuel Macron, who had a phone call with Johnson over the weekend, called for a quick clarification of the U.K.\u2019s position. In a statement, he said a delay \u201cwould not be in any party\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s junior minister for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, told French news broadcaster BFM TV there would have to be a reason for the delay, like a parliamentary election in Britain or a new British referendum on Brexit.\n\nThe British government still hopes it can pass the needed Brexit legislation by the end of the month so the U.K. can leave on time.\n\nBut it suffered a setback on Saturday - Parliament\u2019s first weekend sitting since the Falklands War of 1982 - when British lawmakers voted to make support for the Brexit deal conditional on passage of the legislation to implement it, something that could take several days or weeks.\n\nThat also gives lawmakers another chance to scrutinize - and possibly change- the Brexit departure terms while the bill is still in Parliament.\n\n___\n\nGeir Moulson in Berlin and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to push for a vote on his European Union divorce deal on Monday, as Parliament geared up for a week of guerrilla warfare over Brexit.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Lawless", "Danica Kirka"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/britain_brexit_46405_c0-232-5568-3480_s1200x700.jpg?d042ba9cdffe740cc9608ebfe48d30fe03930ac4", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
