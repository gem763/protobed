The two, although initially at loggerheads, appeared to have moved on, with family members saying Mugabe and his wife, Grace, had accepted the coup.\n\nMugabe\u2019s death comes as Zimbabwe lurches from one political, economic and social crisis to another. Many in the country have been blaming the late nationalist for the economic mess that they are trying to shake off.\n\nBut, in Gweshe\u2019s opinion, Mugabe leaves behind a good legacy for his people: \u201cWe are sad to hear about his death because we know our lives will never be the same again. Thanks to him, I was able to go to school and to be among the educated in the country. Under his rule, life was better. We could afford to buy things, but now it is horrible.\u201d\n\nHer mother, Susan, also speaks of how life worsened for them after Mugabe was removed from power.\n\n\u201cIt has been getting more and more difficult. We feel like we have been on our own ever since he was removed from office. We are mourning for our son here in Zvimba. He remains one of us and we will remember him for all the good things he did for us, like setting up irrigation schemes and giving us good education.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment is shared by those who supported and stood by Mugabe, especially those belonging to the G40 camp that fell with him in 2017.\n\nLeo Mugabe, a spokesperson for the family, told City Press by phone yesterday morning that they had not yet finalised funeral arrangements.\n\nFar from his rural home, and mainly in Harare, there is a general sense of bitterness among citizens, although this has of late been tinged by exasperation over how life appears to be worsening even though Mugabe is not longer in power.\n\nIn beerhalls, on the streets and in homesteads, people have been debating Mugabe\u2019s contribution to the country\u2019s economic difficulties.\n\nOthers have expressed misgivings over his role in the Gukurahundi massacres in the Matabeleland region.\n\nThose living in cities have been unforgiving regarding the harassment of his opponents, as well as the abductions and disappearances of activists such as Itai Dzamara, which happened on his watch.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how he can be celebrated. He is the author of our troubles as a nation. More Zimbabweans are leaving the country because it is unbearable here. It all started with him,\u201d said Braeside resident Brighton Jumbe.\n\nMany consider Grace to be Mugabe\u2019s downfall, especially after he tried to propel her into power within the Zanu PF party, although he had always insisted that his successor had to be elected by the people.\n\nZimbabwe Defence Forces commander General Philip Valerio Sibanda \u2013 one of the key organisers of the military takeover of power from Mugabe \u2013 was quick to emphasise that Mugabe should be remembered for the good that he did: \u201cWhatever happened towards the end of his leadership should not be used to rubbish the good things that he did during his life.\u201d\n\nOpposition leaders including Nelson Chamisa and Tendai Biti had kind words for their long-time political nemesis, saying he had made a big contribution to the country\u2019s liberation war.\n\n\u201cThere are issues where we differed sharply. We differed on how to manage the economy and on how to treat the rule of law, as well as on issues of property rights and the Constitution,\u201d said Chamisa.", "description": "Twenty-year-old Tariro Gweshe, a neighbour of late former Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe in his rural Zvimba village, has a rare appreciation for the former guerrilla fighter.", "authors": ["Elia Ntali", "Memory Mataranyika", "Tawanda Karombo Murombedzi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7771/71a47aa2a4f043e2aec9ff2df296fbfd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
