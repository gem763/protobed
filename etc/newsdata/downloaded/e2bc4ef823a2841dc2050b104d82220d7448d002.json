Reverse the successful effort to defeat #ISIS, where #SDF sacrificed 11K martyrs of our sons & daughters over 5 years of war, which led to destroy the caliphate & created stability & security for the people of NE #Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said Australia would not be moving to extract Australian women and children who fled to the al-Hawl refugee camp, after Isis\u2019s defeat.\n\nThe site is reportedly under threat, after Kurdish soldiers guarding it and its surrounds moved to defend against the Turkish incursion at the border.\n\nThe government has stripped at least three more dual citizens of their Australian citizenship after they travelled to Syria to join with Isis fighters, including Zehra Duman, who left the country as a teenager to marry an Islamic State member. There are concerns her two children had been left stateless by the decision.\n\nMorrison said his advice was the citizenship status of her children were not impacted by her own citizenship cancellation.\n\nDutton says there would be no emergency extraction of Australians trapped in the camp, despite the shifting situation.\n\n'On the edge of a humanitarian catastrophe': Turkish offensive begins Read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should come as any surprise to people when we say that we\u2019re not going to send our soldiers or our staff through the foreign affairs department or my department into harm\u2019s way to rescue people of this nature,\u201d he told Sydney radio station 2GB.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at individual cases, and in some cases it may make sense for us to intervene but in the majority of cases I think people realise that if you go into a war zone, and you take your kids into a war zone, that\u2019s a decision you\u2019ve made as a parent.\n\n\u201cThe fact that you made a decision to destroy the lives of your children, that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to live with, but my job is to protect kids back here and make sure that Australians are as safe as possible.\u201d\n\nMorrison and Payne backed Dutton\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cThe full implications of the Turkish military operation on these camps and the people residing in them are difficult to assess at this early stage and will depend, in part, on subsequent actions taken by Turkey and the Kurds,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe government remains concerned for the Australians in these camps but, as we have previously stated, the situation is dangerous and unpredictable, and we will not put Australian officials and the public in danger.\u201d", "description": "Comments come day after prime minister stood by Trump decision to withdraw US troops", "authors": ["Amy Remeikis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e3b77e0714da0566b8abf11cb9f69cc785c9d12/0_168_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b03b9b72641886713aa0edfc4269eb09", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
