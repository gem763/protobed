He said the longer action to reverse emissions was delayed, the more the risk of collapse would grow.\n\nCarney has led efforts to address the dangers global heating poses to the financial sector, from increasing extreme weather disasters to a potential fall in asset values such as fossil fuel company valuations as government regulations bite. The Guardian revealed last week that just 20 fossil fuel companies have produced coal, oil and gas linked to more than a third of all emissions in the modern era.\n\nThe Bank of England has said up to $20tn (\u00a316tn) of assets could be wiped out if the climate emergency is not addressed effectively. But Carney also said great fortunes could be made by those working to end greenhouse gas emissions with a big potential upside for the UK economy in particular.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Carney said disclosure by companies of the risks posed by climate change to their business was key to a smooth transition to a zero-carbon world as it enabled investors to back winners.\n\n\u201cThere will be industries, sectors and firms that do very well during this process because they will be part of the solution,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there will also be ones that lag behind and they will be punished.\u201d\n\nCarney said in July: \u201cCompanies that don\u2019t adapt will go bankrupt without question.\u201d\n\nUS coal companies had already lost 90% of their value, he noted, but banks were also at risk. \u201cJust like in any other major structural change, those banks overexposed to the sunset sectors will suffer accordingly,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\nThe central bank governor said transition to net zero carbon emissions would change the value of every asset, raising the risk of shocks to the financial system.\n\n\u201cSome [assets] will go up, many will go down. The question is whether the transition is smooth or is it something that is delayed and then happens very abruptly. That is an open question,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer the adjustment is delayed in the real economy, the greater the risk that there is a sharp adjustment.\u201d\n\nIn April, Carney said: \u201cThe stakes are undoubtedly high, but the commitment of all actors in the financial system to act will help avoid a climate-driven \u2018Minsky moment\u2019 \u2013 the term we use to refer to a sudden collapse in asset prices.\u201d\n\nFar from damaging the global economy, climate action bolsters economic growth, according to Carney. \u201cThere is a need for [action] to achieve net zero emissions, but actually it comes at a time when there is a need for a big increase in investment globally to accelerate the pace of global growth, to help get global interest rates up, to get us out of this low-growth, low-interest-rate trap we are in.\u201d\n\nFailing to act would have severe consequences, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t normally quote bankers, but James Gorman, who is the CEO of Morgan Stanley, said the other day: \u2018If we don\u2019t have a planet, we\u2019re not going to have a very good financial system.\u2019 Ultimately, that is true.\u201d\n\nThe UK remained a climate leader, Carney said, and could benefit from action as a climate-smart financial centre and zero-carbon industrial force.\n\nMark Carney: most fossil fuel reserves can't be burned Read more\n\n\u201cCertainly the UK financial system is one of the most sophisticated at managing this risk. The UK can extend that lead, for the good of the UK, for the good of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cA number of the industrial solutions draw on the strengths of UK innovation, from the use of artificial intelligence in energy systems through to potentially advanced materials like graphene. There is a big upside for the UK economy.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Carney told big corporations they had two years to agree rules for reporting climate risks before global regulators devised their own and made them compulsory.\n\nReacting to the Guardian\u2019s revelations about fossil fuel companies, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK Labour party, said: \u201cLabour will delist companies that fail to meet environmental criteria from the [London Stock Exchange], and reform the finance sector to make it part of the solution to climate change instead of lending to companies that are part of the problem.\u201d", "description": "Bank of England governor warns of financial collapse linked to climate emergency", "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/747347f3d63db1636e66bb15ca96be61fdde6155/27_1431_2109_1266/master/2109.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79cc7a080cbc1bdb9c0ff67488817053", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
