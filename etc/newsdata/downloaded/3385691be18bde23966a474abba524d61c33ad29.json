Does a great phone truly need a great display, great design, and top-of-the-line specs? What if it ditched all of those things in pursuit of something far more unique and special?\n\nThe Hydrogen One is defined by its ambition. It\u2019s meant to revolutionize not just phones, but all of media with a \u201cholographic\u201d display and a camera system capable of recording into this 3D format. The phone is also expandable, and RED \u2014 one of the most esteemed names in digital imaging \u2014 plans to release an add-on camera sensor that\u2019s capable of transforming the phone into a full-on cinema camera.\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting prospect, but it all comes crashing down because of one immense flaw: the holographic display just isn\u2019t very good. It\u2019s a novelty. And while you can occasionally see glimmers of the potential that RED might have seen in this tech, it\u2019s certainly not present in this generation of the phone, and it\u2019s hard to imagine that potential being realized any time soon.\n\nOur review of RED Hydrogen One Verge Score 3 out of 10 Good Stuff Unique design\n\nHuge, long-lasting battery\n\nTries something new Bad Stuff Holographic display is blurry and bad\n\nNo accessories yet for expansion pins\n\nPhone is huge and bulky\n\nLarge bezels around sub-par display\n\nLittle 3D content\n\nLast year\u2019s processor\n\nFalls far short of other $1,000+ phones Buy for $1,295.00 from Verizon\n\nI\u2019ll get around to talking about the \u201cphone\u201d parts of the Hydrogen One later, but for now, I\u2019m going to jump straight into the display \u2014 because that\u2019s all that matters here.\n\nOn the front of the Hydrogen One is a 5.7-inch, WQHD resolution LCD screen that contains the magic used to create RED\u2019s extremely hyped holograms. As a regular display, it\u2019s not great \u2014 particularly on lighter backgrounds, the pixel grid is clearly visible even at a comfortable viewing distance, and the display\u2019s backlight bleeds out from the top and bottom edges.\n\nBut what\u2019s important is that beneath the glass is a special piece of tech made by a company called Leia that\u2019s able to switch the display into 3D mode. Leia calls the tech \u201cDiffractive Lightfield Backlighting\u201d and says that it works by placing a \u201cnanostructured light guide plate\u201d beneath the LCD. I believe that jumble of words just means that it can steer the direction in which each pixel emits light, so that your eyes can see different things and the illusion of depth.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time someone has tried to build 3D into a phone, but there are a couple things special here. For one, you don\u2019t need glasses to see it. But the bigger improvement is that images have a bit more going on: where normal 3D is stereoscopic \u2014 there are two images, one for each eye \u2014 RED\u2019s 3D has four images, so there\u2019s a bit more movement as you look around. Because of this, RED refers to its 3D format as \u201c4V,\u201d or \u201c4 View.\u201d\n\nRED has spent the last year building up expectations around this \u201cholographic\u201d screen. It\u2019s only shown the phone to a small number of people \u2014 including director J.J. Abrams, who supposedly said the phone was \u201cground-breaking, barrier-smashing, bar-raising, and badass.\u201d But mostly it\u2019s been shown to RED fans who preordered the device sight unseen, as well as a handful of journalists. None of them were allowed to photograph or otherwise capture what the screen looked like, so it\u2019s been a real mystery to most of the world. I don\u2019t know about everyone else, but I\u2019ve been imagining icons floating above the display.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case, though. Most of the time, you\u2019re just looking at a regular, 2D screen. The entire Android interface, the web, and all of your normal apps will display as they always have. It\u2019s only when you use one of a select few holographic apps that you pop into 3D mode.\n\nAnd it\u2019s pretty jarring when it happens. Not because it\u2019s so striking, but because the display suddenly becomes a blur. Several people told me it made them dizzy.\n\nThe 3D effect isn\u2019t very strong, and it made some people dizzy\n\nNothing ever pops out at you in holographic mode, despite what the name would imply. Instead, the mode adds a bit of depth into the screen.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s hard to share what this looks like in a photo or video, because cameras don\u2019t pick it up very well. But if you\u2019ve used a Nintendo 3DS, you know the effect: it\u2019s a pretty standard lenticular type of 3D, and I actually think the 3DS does it better. A more apt comparison would be to the postcards and lunch boxes that have those lenticular displays that make it look like they\u2019re changing when you move them side to side.\n\nThe typical experience here is of a paper cutout being placed on top of a flat background. It creates some illusion of depth, but it\u2019s very clearly artificial in most cases.\n\nThe bigger problem is that the screen is just blurry. It looks like the entire display has been smudged up when holographic mode kicks in. Any added realism you might get from the depth effect is more than taken away by the inability to clearly see what you\u2019re looking at.\n\nThere are very few ways you can use this holographic display. RED includes an app store for holographic apps, but there\u2019s little in it \u2014 about a dozen games and apps in total. I doubt there will be many more since developers don\u2019t have much incentive to create a holographic app just to sell to the, I\u2019m going to guess, small number of people who buy this phone.\n\nI tried a couple games out, hoping they would make the holographic screen pop. But I found the effect minimally noticeable and suspect the extra rendering needed to make 3D work ends up slowing them down. One game I played, a holographic, Paddington-themed ripoff of Subway Surfers, would get choppy any time fast action was happening, which was basically always. A holographic version of Modern Combat 5 just looked like my weapon was printed out on top of the background.\n\nThe 4V social network crashed every time I tried to log in\n\nRED put together a library of videos you can watch in this holographic format, too, but I\u2019m kind of bewildered by them. One I watched, a flyover of Mars\u2019 surface, strained my eyes and made me feel kind of nauseous, without even looking that 3D. Another, showing highlights of Olympic athletes, didn\u2019t appear to be 3D at all. Eventually, you\u2019re supposed to be able to download real shows and movies in here, but it\u2019s not at all clear to me that RED has the deals in place to make that happen. The AT&T version of this phone will include free copies of Fantastic Beasts and Ready Player One in 3D.\n\nThe store also includes an app called Holopix, which is supposed to be like Instagram for holographic photos captured on the Hydrogen One. Unfortunately, Holopix crashed every time I tried to log in, so I can\u2019t say whether other people are taking better photos than me.\n\nThe other big deal on this phone is its cameras. Dual cameras on the front of the device (8 megapixels each) and dual cameras on the back of the device (12 megapixels each) allow you to snap holographic photos and record holographic videos right from the phone. RED is a camera company, after all, and it hopes to enable yet another wave of enthusiasts to create things that weren\u2019t possible on traditional cameras.\n\nBut as you might guess by this point, the results aren\u2019t amazing. Photos of people generally end up looking really goofy, with the person appearing as a paper cutout on top of whatever was behind them. Some of my co-workers figured out that by holding their arms out, they could create depth and make the photos look more interesting, but at most it just felt like another layer of paper placed on top. It\u2019s more uncanny than it is 3D.\n\nLandscape photos have a subtler effect, since there aren\u2019t obvious cutouts on them and you get a clearer impression of space gradually fading into the distance. I found this was usually the case with videos, too \u2014 my own recordings were where the 3D effect seemed most evident and compelling to me. It\u2019s here that I actually started to understand what RED might have been thinking, how you could start to see 3D as this rich new way of capturing the world.\n\nThat said, videos are still a pain to watch. The effect tends to flicker in and out and have lots of strange artifacts. It can hurt your eyes to watch, and it\u2019s a little dizzying anytime there\u2019s too much motion and the layers of depth are constantly changing. Plus, like everything else, the screen is still all smudgy.\n\nCapturing photos and videos is kind of a pain, too. RED only figured out how to make it work when the camera array is side by side, so you can only record holographic footage from the rear cameras when the phone is turned sideways, and you can only record from the front cameras when the phone is held vertically. If you turn the phone too far, it\u2019ll snap out of holographic shooting mode, then snap back again when you return to the correct position. I wanted to take a landscape holographic selfie so I could get another person in the frame, but the camera wouldn\u2019t let me.\n\nWhen you want to view your photos and videos in 3D later, you have to use the RED Player app, which looks like its interface was designed during the early days of Android \u2014 that\u2019s to say, it\u2019s chunky, ugly, and practical. It works, it\u2019s just not the easiest app to navigate around. All of your 3D photos are also available to view in 2D, so you can share them with others who don\u2019t own a Hydrogen One (i.e., the rest of the planet).\n\nIf you buy this phone, it\u2019s very likely that the only way you\u2019ll be able to show other people your 3D photos and videos is by handing the device over to them. They\u2019re only viewable on the Hydrogen One, and while RED\u2019s leadership thinks this tech will eventually come to laptops, TVs, and movie theaters, I wouldn\u2019t bank on that happening any time soon, or ever.\n\nThen there\u2019s the rest of the phone. During a private event earlier this month, RED CEO Jim Jannard said \u201cif you concentrate on what we\u2019re doing that the other guys aren\u2019t, you\u2019re gonna love it. If you concentrate on a bug or a problem or Holopix crashes and write that we suck, then I\u2019m gonna be mortified.\u201d And it\u2019s true \u2014 the Hydrogen One does not succeed when judged as a traditional smartphone. It\u2019s not all bad. For the most part, things work and the specs aren\u2019t terrible. It\u2019s just that the phone isn\u2019t anywhere close to being on par with what you can get if you spent your $1,300 elsewhere.\n\nThe biggest thing to talk about here is the design, because it\u2019s unlike any other phone. There are two different textures on the back, and the sides of the phone dip in and out with a ribbed texture, offering grips for your fingers. The overall effect is something that seems to be designed for a \u1d1b\u1d0f\u1d1c\u0262\u029c \u1d05\u1d1c\u1d05\u1d07, and I don\u2019t really care for it, but I\u2019m happy to see RED trying something different.\n\nThe finger grips are a nice idea in theory, but they didn\u2019t work out for me in practice. The sides of the phone are very grippy, so that\u2019s nice. But you don\u2019t usually hold a phone in this precise way with your fingers spread out along the length of it. Because buttons are embedded in some of the grips, you end up accidentally hitting them, too.\n\nI dropped the phone on someone\u2019s face and the red mark stayed for a week\n\nThe phone is also really big \u2014 because of its bezels, it\u2019s larger in every dimension than the 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max \u2014 and heavy. Like too heavy. While showing the phone to my fianc\u00e9e, I accidentally dropped it about two inches, directly onto her face, leaving a red mark that\u2019s stayed for days. Now, that\u2019s my fault (and I feel very bad about it!). But plenty of people have dropped phones on their face in bed, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re walking around with welts because of it.\n\nBecause the phone was supposed to come out last year, it also has last year\u2019s processor \u2014 a Snapdragon 835 at a time when every other flagship has an 845. On one hand, who cares? The phone runs fine, and the 835 is still a great processor. But on the other, this is a $1,300 phone, and it\u2019s missing something that\u2019s in every other (decidedly cheaper) flagship Android phone currently available. It\u2019s an unnecessary miss on a phone that\u2019s already in the hole.\n\nRED sometimes refers to this phone as a \u201cmedia machine,\u201d which is a really goofy way of trying to say that it\u2019s more than just a phone. It\u2019s not particularly great for consuming media, though: you can often see the lines between the pixels when there\u2019s a light background, and the speakers sound distant and hollow. By default, something called \u201cAudio 3D\u201d is turned on, which made the phone get confused and only blare noises out of one speaker or the other (often switching mid-sound); I turned that off, and the problem stopped, but the sound quality wasn\u2019t much better.\n\nThe phone\u2019s strange design extends to its software, where you see a dark interface with big, screen-flipping animations. RED even made custom, grayed-out icons for a bunch of apps, but it\u2019s weirdly inconsistent which ones have it and which ones don\u2019t: Dropbox gets a custom icon, but Twitter and Facebook are still blue.\n\nOne area RED does better is regular, 2D photos. Now, you don\u2019t exactly get RED\u2019s color science here \u2014 Jannard told me the phone just doesn\u2019t have the horsepower in it to apply the same kind of coloring done on the company\u2019s cinema cameras \u2014 and you\u2019re not getting a RED-made sensor, either. But in good lighting, you do get photos with some really nice, rich, and natural colors to them that I quite liked.\n\nI wish RED had put its actual camera prowess into this phone\n\nUnfortunately, that doesn\u2019t extend to most of your photos, and it\u2019s clear that RED doesn\u2019t have the same software chops that its competitors have when it comes to making good use of a tiny sensor. The Hydrogen One falls apart in low light, and even in good lighting, it can\u2019t match the dynamic range of the latest iPhones or Pixels. I often saw the phone blow out highlights that my Pixel 2 could capture. It really feels like a missed opportunity \u2014 it would have been wonderful to have a RED camera that fit in your pocket, but RED\u2019s photography efforts instead went toward shooting 3D.\n\nThe phone also has a tiny physical camera button on the right side, embedded into the grip. I\u2019m super into dedicated shutter buttons, but it\u2019s a little tiny; and the phone\u2019s big weight and size puts it in an awkward position. You can press and hold the button to launch the camera, which is nice, but it didn\u2019t always work for me.\n\nThere\u2019s one final big feature on this phone that I haven\u2019t talked about yet, and that\u2019s a series of small gold pins along the back. This is the Hydrogen One\u2019s accessory expansion interface, and you\u2019re supposed to be able to attach all kinds of things to transform the phone, much like Motorola\u2019s Moto Mods.\n\nThe most exciting of those is a full-on RED-made camera sensor, with a lens mount that allows you to attach real lenses. It effectively turns the phone into a monitor for a tiny cinema rig, and Jannard says you can shoot a RED-quality movie on it. \u201cIf you were shooting an 8K Weapon on set as your A camera, this could certainly be your B camera,\u201d he told me. \u201cNo question.\u201d\n\nThe Hydrogen One isn\u2019t meant to stand up to the iPhones, Pixels, and Galaxys\n\nUnfortunately, that accessory doesn\u2019t exist yet. And neither do any others. RED hasn\u2019t even announced full details on the sensor, let alone its price \u2014 and you have to imagine it\u2019ll cost more than the phone itself, given that RED\u2019s cameras start at over $12,000. Given that the Hydrogen One is already a year delayed, it\u2019s not at all clear that these accessories will launch any time soon.\n\nAnd so, the three big things meant to set the Hydrogen One apart \u2014 its holographic display, 3D photo and video capture, and a powerful accessories port \u2014 all fail, and are ultimately the phone\u2019s weakest points.\n\nThis phone isn\u2019t meant to be compared against the iPhones, Pixels, and Galaxys. It\u2019s supposed to be its own thing: rough in a few of the \u201cphone\u201d places so that it can wow in its own unique ways. It\u2019s not meant for everyone. It\u2019s for the RED fans and 3D enthusiasts who think smartphones should give us more.\n\nBut no matter what terms you review this phone on, it misses the mark. And with a $1,300 price tag, it\u2019s impossible to justify how badly it misses.", "description": "The Hydrogen One is defined by its ambition.
