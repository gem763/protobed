Prices had dipped 1.2% in the previous week on hopes\n\nthat an end to the U.S.-China trade tiff could be near.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 rose 0.8% to $1,511.20 per ounce.\n\nThe attacks on Saudi oil installations have lead to a\n\nrotation of interests out of stocks and into safe-havens, said\n\nOANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.\n\nWith escalating tensions in the Middle East and hopes of\n\nmore stimulus measures from major central banks, the next target\n\nfor gold will be $1,530, he added.\n\nYemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebel group claimed\n\nresponsibility for the attack over the weekend on the world's\n\nbiggest oil-processing facility. However, a senior U.S. official said that evidence indicated\n\nTehran was behind it, and President Donald Trump said the United\n\nStates was \"locked and loaded\" for a potential response to the\n\nattack, souring its already strained relations with Iran.\n\nThe event hurt risk sentiment in the markets, with Asian\n\nequities trading lower at 515.4, and the safe-haven yen\n\nup 0.4% to 107.64 per dollar.

Lower interest\n\nrates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding\n\nbullion and weigh on the dollar.\n\nMeanwhile, weighing further on risk sentiment was dismal\n\ndata from China, which showed factory and consumer sectors\n\nslowed further in August, with industrial production growing at\n\nthe weakest pace in 17-1/2 years, a sign of increasing weakness\n\nin an economy lashed by trade headwinds and soft domestic\n\ndemand.
