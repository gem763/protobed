The Post said Pence's national security adviser monitored Trump's call but didn't hear anything he felt should be relayed to the vice president.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry by disclosing the call alleged that Trump instructed Pence to cancel plans to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, a detail given in the context of Trump wanting to wait to see how the new leader \u201cchose to act\u201d in office.\n\nVice President Mike Pence appears alongside Sen. Martha McSally on Oct. 3, 2019, in Arizona. More\n\nAlong with their letter released Thursday, Democratic heads of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees also released text messages showing a high level of apprehension among State Department officials that Trump had linked U.S. assistance to Ukraine to an agreement from Zelensky that he would reciprocate by taking steps that would help Trump politically at home.\n\n\"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Bill Taylor, the top American diplomat stationed in Ukraine, wrote in one message.\n\nA second Trump official, Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, pushed back, writing: \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\"\n\nSondland also said they should stop talking about the matter online, perhaps realizing the implications of such messages.\n\nTrump eventually released the military aid after a bipartisan backlash from from U.S. lawmakers in both parties.\n\nContributing: Deidre Shesgreen.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump Impeachment probe: Democrats investigating Pence's Ukraine role", "description": "House Democrats are investigating Vice President Mike Pence's actions as part of their impeachment inquiry into\u00a0President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Maureen Groppe", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WDU.1yZ5LdKEHVMPT45jeA--~B/aD0yODA0O3c9Mzg0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/7937cdfa2ecc4c1f2353a668c5e3bc00", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
