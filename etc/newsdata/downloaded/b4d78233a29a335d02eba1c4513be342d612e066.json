The balloon eventually landed and the fire was put out.\n\nThe two people who were injured were taken to a local hospital but have since been treated and released, according to Garrity.\n\nThe incident happened in Rio Rancho, a nearby suburb of Albuquerque.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what caused the balloon's hard landing and Lynn directed all questions to the Federal Aviation Administration. A spokesperson for the FAA said the agency was investigating.\n\nRichard Lakin/Xinhua/Newscom\n\nThe balloon's brush with a power line caused an outage for about an hour in the suburb, Meaghan Cavanaugh, spokesperson for New Mexico's Public Service Company, told ABC News.\n\nA separate incident, in which another balloon grazed a power line, happened earlier that morning but did not result in any outages, Cavanaugh said. She did not know exactly what set off the series of accidents.\n\n\"For the most part, [accidents like the one Monday] are not a regular occurrence,\" Cavaugh said. She added, \"We always hope this type of stuff doesn't happen but we know how important it is to be ready in the event it does happen.\"\n\nThe Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta runs from Oct. 5 to Oct. 13 and brings more than 500 balloons to New Mexico.", "description": "Two people were thrown from a hot air balloon after a faulty landing at the New Mexico hot air balloon festival.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/balloon-nc-er-191008_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
