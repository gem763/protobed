He has since won two elections \u2013 in 2014 and 2018. He made headlines in August after accusing Australian prime minister Scott Morrison of being \u201cinsulting and condescending\u201d to fellow Pacific leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu, and refusing to make concessions on climate policy.", "description": "Frank Bainimarama\u2019s heated argument with opposition MP Pio Tikoduadua was captured on video", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d794bb80e8e22e0801e0ed702b216605392d924/0_40_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e67e5d390d2da39dbb4dedaa1e15869", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
