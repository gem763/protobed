Countries in eastern and south-eastern Asia have made the most progress, with an 80% fall in under-five deaths.", "description": "More women and newborns survive now than ever before, largely thanks to better healthcare, United Nations data showed on Thursday, but a baby or a pregnant woman still dies every 11 seconds somewhere in the world.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
