Let's check on the charts and indicators.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of FUN, below, we can see that prices have been in a rally phase since late June. Prices are above the rising 50-day moving average line and the bullish 200-day line. The 50-day line crossed above the 200-day line in September for what is commonly called a (bullish) golden cross.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has moved upward from late June to tell us that buyers of FUN have been more aggressive and that this indicator has confirmed the price action.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator turned bullish in July and could soon cross to the upside for a fresh buy signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of FUN, below, we can see a bullish picture. Prices are trading above the rising 40-week moving average line and the prior highs of 2019.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has rallied strongly to a new high to confirm the price gains. The MACD oscillator is also very bullish.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of FUN, below, we can see that an upside price target of $76 is being projected.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Trade FUN from the long side risking below $54 while looking for longer-term gains to the $76 area.", "description": "Shares of amusement park operator Cedar Fair (FUN) still look bullish.
