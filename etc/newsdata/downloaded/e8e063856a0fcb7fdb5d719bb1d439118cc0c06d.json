The company\u2019s most profitable shop is nearly twice its original size.\n\nCrowds of people formed lines early Friday morning awaiting Apple\u2019s new product launches, including its iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max in addition to new Apple Watches. CEO Tim Cook greeted customers to kick off the reopening, taking selfies with fans outside the store.\n\nImage 1 of 4 \u25bc One of the first customers to purchase the new iPhone 11 exits the store at Apple's flagship Fifth Avenue location.

Customers can take a spiral staircase or elevator down to the underground store. Once customers are underneath, there's a combination of natural light beaming through portholes and a new LED system above that will adjust its color throughout the day. Several trees have also been planted along with a wall covered in plants to bring life into the space.\n\nApple employees wait for customers to arrive at Apple's flagship Fifth Avenue store.

There are also 18 shiny metal seats \u2013 what the company calls \u201csky lenses\u201d \u2013 that offer a view down into the retail space.\n\nThe store has been a destination for tourists since it opened in 2006. It will be open 24-hours a day, every day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Apple reopened its iconic Fifth Avenue flagship in New York City.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/iPhone-Apple-Getty-03.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
