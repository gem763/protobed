Col. John Dirk, the commanding officer for VMFA 122, said of the training that took place earlier this month.\n\nThirteen U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II with Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 122 on the USS America.

No, it doesn't, but it does have a very interesting sting to it.\"\n\nThese carriers could be used to augment the carrier force, especially at times when the Navy's aircraft-carrier fleet is facing readiness concerns.", "description": "The Navy and the Marines recently trained with 13 F-35Bs aboard the large amphibious USS America, further testing the \"Lightning carrier\" concept.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db2f0e8dee01971a278e759?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
