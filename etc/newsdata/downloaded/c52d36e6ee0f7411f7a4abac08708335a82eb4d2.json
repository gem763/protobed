It\u2019s diminishing to be perceived mainly as someone else\u2019s son,\u2019 Cameron writes in that book. \u2018How do you compete with Kirk Douglas? How do you live in Michael Douglas\u2019 shadow?\u2019\n\nThe topic of unconventional family dynamics permeates much of the memoir, which is released on Tuesday, a theme which proves to have significant hold over Cameron's life even now.\n\nIn his new book, Long Way Home, Cameron Douglas (left) admits he may have been born into Hollywood royalty, but his life has been anything but a fairy-tale. The son of Michael Douglas (right), 75, and the grandson of silver-screen legend, Kirk Douglas, 102, Cameron reveals the difficulties he grappled with growing up in the long shadow cast by his paternal lineage\n\n\u2018Even as a really young kid, I remember running joints back and forth,\u2019 Cameron said of his dad\u2019s parties, which regularly featured a bevy of stars including the likes of Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito.\n\n\u2018Dad would say, \u201cHey, bring this over to your uncle,\u201d and I would, not realizing until years later what it had been. As I got older, I would creep from house to house on the compound, climbing balconies and seeing more than I was supposed to: beautiful grown-ups doing the things that beautiful grown-ups living lives of excess do.\u2019\n\nCameron would then wait for dawn to descend and for his dad\u2019s famous friends to retire to their rooms before rifling through their bags, minesweeping any substances they\u2019d left behind.\n\nIt was after such parties that Cameron remember his dad would always take him for early morning breakfasts at a hotel in Sunset Boulevard.\n\nBut it was only years later the true reason behind the father-son moments \u2013 which were otherwise fleeting \u2013 became clear: Cameron realized his father was coming down from drugs after a long night of partying.\n\nThough he makes clear in the book he blames only himself for the squandering of his privileged beginnings, Cameron was exposed to the partying scene from an early age\n\n\u2018Our relationship was a series of jump cuts, vivid bursts when we were together punctuating longer stretches when we were apart,\u2019 Cameron writes, conceding that his father\u2019s career, as well as partying ways, added strain to their bond.\n\nAs Michael's career demanded he spend more and more time away from home, one summer he came to the conclusion that his young son needed a \u2018more constant male influence\u2019 in his life.\n\nDuring a lunch with Cameron\u2019s mother, Diandra, at the Ivy in Beverly Hills, Michael identified a busboy hovering near their table as the ideal candidate.\n\n\u2018Dad said, \u201cWhat about this guy? He seems very capable. He could be a houseman or something like that.\u201d Mom spoke to him in Spanish . . . he was from El Salvador,\u2019 Cameron writes. \u2018Soon [he] was living with us. He took care of me from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep.\u2019\n\nBut Cameron says he was left heartbroken at aged 10 when the busboy-come-makeshift father figure was fired after Diandra found vodka bottles under his bed and asked him to stop drinking, but he refused.\n\nA few years later, Cameron had to contend with the difficult news his father had checked into rehab for sex addiction after Diandra caught him in bed with another woman.\n\nCameron says his mother gave Michael an ultimatum that he had to \u2018deal with his drug and alcohol intake\u2019 or she would leave him. Two weeks later he checked into the Sierra Tuscon clinic in Arizona.\n\nBut his infidelity continued, and Diandra reached breaking point in 1995, when a private investigator caught him entering the Beverly Wilshire hotel with another woman.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s sad to think back on, but when they told me they were getting divorced, it didn\u2019t knock my socks off. Actually, I welcomed it,\u2019 Cameron remembered.\n\nBut his parent\u2019s broken marriage did little to solidify more of a union with his father. In fact, Cameron recalls one interaction with Michael where he explicitly told him it was impossible to develop a relationship with him.\n\n\u2018I think you\u2019re going to overdose, or someone\u2019s going to kill you, or you\u2019re going to kill someone. I\u2019m trying to prepare myself emotionally,\u2019 Michael reportedly said to him.\n\nThough now the 40-year-old has set his sights on an acting career, in his younger years he chose to follow his father\u2019s footsteps down a different and much darker path \u2013 one that led to a lifestyle of deviance fueled by drug use\n\nThough now the 40-year-old has set his sights on an acting career, in his younger years he chose to follow his father\u2019s footsteps down a different and much darker path \u2013 one leading to lifestyle of deviance fueled by drug use.\n\nFor years, Cameron suffered with cocaine and heroin addiction, sold crystal meth and led a life of self-destruction that, in 2009, went on to land him eight years in jail.\n\nFor years, Cameron suffered with cocaine and heroin addiction, sold crystal meth and led a life of self-destruction that, in 2009, went on to land him eight years in jail.\n\nThough the conviction would act as a catalyst in turning his life around, in the decades before Cameron had a number or run-ins with the law and enjoyed a series near misses for which he was never arrested.\n\nThe Hollywood scion recounted one instance at an LA motel where he held up an elderly cashier with an air gun, demanding she open the cash register.\n\nThough she quickly obliged, all that was inside was a single $20 bill. But still, Cameron snatched the measly amount and ran - confessing the act it was more for the adrenaline than it was about money.\n\n\u2018I like confusing people, making them puzzle over how someone who came from so much privilege can do such crazy sh**,\u2019 Cameron admits.\n\nHis penchant for chaos would see him arrested in New York City in 1999 for cocaine possession, and again six-years-later when police in LA found heroin and crack in his car.\n\nIn 2007 he was charged with possession of a controlled substance after police pulled over his car in Santa Barbara and found a syringe of liquid cocaine in the vehicle.\n\nHis final arrest would come two years later in a sting operation in the Gansevoort hotel in Manhattan, where he later pleaded guilty to heroin possession and conspiracy to distribute drugs.\n\nHe was originally sentenced to five years in prison, but in 2011, Cameron was issued an additional four-and-a-half years for possession of contraband that tested positive for cocaine and heroin.\n\nCameron recalls one interaction with Michael (pictured together in 2009) where he explicitly told him it was impossible to develop a relationship with him. \u2018I think you\u2019re going to overdose, or someone\u2019s going to kill you, or you\u2019re going to kill someone. I\u2019m trying to prepare myself emotionally,\u2019 Michael reportedly said to him\n\nBut despite the uncountable ups-and-downs, Cameron can remember the elation he felt when he was visited by his father and Kirk, who he calls \u2018Pappy\u2019, at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Manhattan before his sentencing in 2009.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so impressed by Pappy, and touched. He\u2019s ninety-three, and he\u2019s come all the way from California to see me,\u2019 Cameron writes, adding Kirk told him \u2018That\u2019s my boy\u2019, when he informed him he\u2019d been emerging victorious in a number of prison fights.\n\nDuring his seven years behind bars, Cameron got a large tattoo of his father and grandfather on his torso, in an ode to overcoming the conflictions he felt growing up in their shadows.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never been able to overcome my conflicting feelings about my last name, my pride in it and at the same time, my discomfort with having it define how other people see me,\u2019 he writes.\n\nCameron Douglas' book, Long Way Home, will be released on Tuesday\n\n\u2018When I get their faces tattooed on my body, I feel ready, finally, to show an uncomplicated pride in them. When I show the tattoo to Dad, he seems embarrassed.\u2019\n\nCameron was eventually released from prison in 2016. He moved into a halfway house in the Bronx before later moving into an apartment in TriBeca with his yoga instructor girlfriend, Viviane Thibes.\n\nHe pays testament to his father\u2019s second wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, for \u2018pushing [Michael] to extend his paternal love to me.\n\n\u2018One day, we\u2019re hanging out and [my dad] says, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you did it. How you went through the things you did.\u201d It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever acknowledged it quite like that,\u2019 Cameron says.\n\nIn December 2017, Cameron became a father himself when Viviane gave birth to their first daughter together, Lua Izzy Douglas.\n\nThey live in Hollywood Hills where Cameron is now pursuing a career as an actor and working to rebuild a relationship with his family.\n\n\u2018[My father and I] never really became friends, as many father and sons do at a certain point, but now we\u2019re starting to do that,\u2019 Cameron writes.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re forming the relationship I\u2019ve always wanted.\u2019", "description": "In his new book, Long Way Home, Cameron Douglas admits he may have been born into Hollywood royalty, but his life has been anything but a fairy-tale.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19965328-0-image-a-34_1571603187720.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
