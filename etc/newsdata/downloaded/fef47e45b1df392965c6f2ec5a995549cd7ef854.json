Remember when Lin-Manuel Miranda pulled that sixth-grade B-student trick of starting a speech with \u201cThe dictionary defines variety as \u2026\u201d and then Adam DeVine of truly all people sang a song, not one lyric of which I can recall for you at this time? (What, suddenly Thingamajig wasn\u2019t available?) Amid all of the mishegoss were some genuinely great wins, even though the acceptance speeches were offset by distracting backdrops of giant, unflattering screen grabs of the winners. These moments include a Fleabag victory tour and monumental wins for Billy Porter and Jharrel Jerome. Below, we\u2019ve compiled all of the best reaction shots and surprise faces from the proceedings:\n\nFirstly, here\u2019s Christina Applegate schooling Jenny McCarthy on the existence of Samantha Who:\n\nGwyneth Paltrow just barely humoring Jenny McCarthy. Seems like everyone collectively has just about had it, officially, with Jenny McCarthy.\n\nGwyneth\u2019s face at the end. pic.twitter.com/47FcyQqhC2 \u2014 Danny Pellegrino (@DannyPellegrino) September 23, 2019\n\nBran clapping for the basically 50 Game of Thrones cast members that got to go onstage and talk about the show without him.\n\nSo they made bran KING and he\u2019s not even up there with them? #Emmys pic.twitter.com/7GfrPz4Xbl \u2014 Ria (@BarstoolRia) September 23, 2019\n\nSarah Silverman reacting to yet another SNL win.\n\nAlfie Allen\u2019s golf clap.\n\nThis face Billy Porter pulled when RuPaul won for Best Competition Reality Series, which Porter insists was pure coincidence.\n\nI identify as Billy Porter\u2019s reaction while Rupaul is accepting an Emmy #Emmys pic.twitter.com/FuhLQijnal \u2014 Phillip Henry (@MajorPhilebrity) September 23, 2019\n\nThe Pose cast being the cutest cheer squad for Billy Porter!\n\nJason Bateman reacting to his win in true Michael Bluth fashion.\n\nNatasha Lyonne\u2019s reaction to\u2026 everything.\n\nIf we took one thing away from last night\u2019s Emmys, it\u2019s that the English are very, very good at winning awards, and they do so with unerring charm. Just look at Jodie Comer\u2019s disbelief at her acting win.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge reacting to the sheer weight of carrying all of television on her back.\n\nBusy Philipps, historic best friend and awards date to Michelle Williams, being very proud of Michelle Williams.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lack of a reaction to Game of Thrones.\n\ngwyneth definitely has no idea what Game of Thrones is pic.twitter.com/uQzexoWiCM \u2014 Jackson McHenry (@McHenryJD) September 23, 2019\n\nThe whole Roy clan giving a standing O for Jesse Armstrong. The delight on Cousin Greg\u2019s face! We love to see it! Though what is with Jeremy Strong\u2019s total stone-faced lack of joy?", "description": "Sunday night\u2019s Emmy Awards had plenty of highs, lows, surprises, and upsets, including major wins for \u201cFleabag\u201d and a final bow for \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Here are the best reactions \u2014 in GIF and social media form \u2014 from the ceremony.", "authors": ["Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/23/23-busy-phillips-emmys-reaction.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
