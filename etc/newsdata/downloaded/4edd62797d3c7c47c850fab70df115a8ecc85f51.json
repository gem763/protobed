I guess it\u2019s a publicity stunt,\u201d Trump told reporters gathered at the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to give them any credibility,\u201d Trump said about former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, all of whom say they plan to take on the president for the GOP nomination. \u201cThey have no credibility. One was a person that voted for Obama, ran as a vice president four years ago and was soundly defeated. Another one got thrown out after one term in Congress and he lost in a landslide, and the third one, \u2018Mr. Tallahassee Trail\u2019 or \u2018Mr. Appalachian Trail,\u2019 he\u2019s the Appalachian Trail, right? The Tallahassee Trail is nice, too, but I think he was the Appalachian Trail, but he wasn\u2019t on the Appalachian Trail, he was in Argentina.\u201d\n\nWeld ran for vice president on the third-party Libertarian line in 2016, along with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. The ticket received nearly 4.5 million votes. Walsh served one term in Congress as a Republican representing Illinois, but after redistricting lost his bid for a second term in 2012.\n\nSanford served as governor of South Carolina before the discovery of an extramarital affair with an Argentine woman led him to step down at the conclusion of his second term. He also served in the U.S. House from 2013 to 2019, before he himself was defeated in a primary. As he announced his entry into the presidential race, he cited the need for debate within his party.\n\nFrom left: Donald Trump, Bill Weld, Mark Sanford and Joe Walsh.

The President of the United States is a pathological liar & a malignant narcissist who last night called an American a \u201cfoul-mouthed wife.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the issues. This is ONLY about saving the country from Trump. \u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 9, 2019\n\nIncumbent presidents have not infrequently faced primary challenges from members of their own party. In 1976, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan sought to replace President Gerald Ford on the Republican ticket. Four years later, former Sen. Edward Kennedy took on President Jimmy Carter, and in 1992, hard-right pundit Patrick Buchanan mounted a campaign against President George H.W. Bush. But none of the incumbents agreed to a primary debate.\n\nLast week, the Republican Party in four states \u2014 Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 announced they planned to cancel 2020 primaries, effectively putting an end to the chances for long-shot GOP challenges to Trump.\n\nCanceled primaries? What are you afraid of, Mr. No-Show? Intelligent, experienced, honest and decent competitors? Now more than ever, @realDonaldTrump, you can run but you cannot hide. #LetTheGamesBegin \u2014 Gov. Bill Weld (@GovBillWeld) September 8, 2019\n\nThe president said he understood the decision to scrap the primaries.\n\n\u201cThe three people are a total joke. They\u2019re a laughingstock. And I have nothing to do \u2014 The four states that canceled it don\u2019t want to waste their money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf there was a race, they would certainly want to do that. But they\u2019re considered to be a laughingstock. They\u2019re considered to be a joke, and those four states don\u2019t want to waste their money. Having primary campaigns and having a primary election is very expensive.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The president brushes aside the notion of debating the Republicans seeking to replace him in 2020.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/prx53xVUn67hl1yLQT7wsA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/b2453070-d33f-11e9-bdff-452df68d3442", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
