Currently, multiple macro headwinds exist, including an escalating U.S.-China trade war and concerns of a looming recession. If we do suffer a downturn, that would threaten virtually all stocks. Fear begets fear, and IBM stock would not be spared.\n\nThat said, a recession doesn\u2019t necessarily spell catastrophe. For one thing, a market correction could still be considered a healthy occurrence for stocks\u2019 longer-term outlook. Moreover, an economic slump may force us to eliminate dead weight. Granted, a recession will generate pain, but it will also likely streamline the economy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, IBM has some attributes that I believe many analysts are either overlooking or discounting too sharply. As a result, the shares look like a contrarian opportunity, especially if the IBM stock price hits last year\u2019s lows. Here are three reasons why I believe that:\n\nIBM Stock Has Relatively Limited Exposure to China\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, technology firms collapsed as the trade war kicked off. However, Wall Street put aside its concerns in the new year as the geopolitical outlook started to stabilize.\n\nThat sentiment reversed again, though, in August, as the U.S. and China ratcheted up the rhetoric and pressure. And by the end of the month, President Trump announced a tariff hike on essentially all Chinese imports. Unsurprisingly, International Business Machines stock, along with other tech investments, felt the heat.\n\nNevertheless, International Business Machines stock looks interesting relative to its peers. That\u2019s because the IBM stock price isn\u2019t as levered to the trade war as you might imagine.\n\nFor instance, in 2018, the company\u2019s Asia Pacific revenue totaled $17.1 billion,, below the company\u2019s other two regions, which are the Americas, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Asia represented a little over 21% of IBM\u2019s total corporate revenue last year.\n\nLet\u2019s compare that to some of IBM\u2019s competitors, like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). China accounted for approximately 25% of Intel\u2019s revenue, while it generated about 20% of Nvidia\u2019s top line. Moving forward, exposure to an increasingly assertive China is a risk factor. But it\u2019s much less worrisome for IBM stock. than for Intel, Nvidia, and many other tech names.\n\nIBM\u2019s Long-Term Cloud Potential\n\nWhen \u201cBig Blue\u201d bought Red Hat for $34 billion, it did so with the intention of enhancing its cloud offerings. However, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its AWS platform lead this lucrative sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, this has caused people to adopt a pessimistic view of International Business Machines stock. Frequently, pundits and analysts say that IBM paid too much for Red Hat and is getting very little in return. But I think this is a short-sighted way to look at this key acquisition.\n\nAlthough AWS has been around for a few years, the cloud is still in its infancy. But as this technology evolves, so will users\u2019 demands. Therefore, it\u2019s unlikely that one type of solution will be appropriate for every company.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the Red Hat deal comes in. The acquired company specializes in hybrid cloud solutions, which involves interconnecting multiple cloud and enterprise-level platforms. Such a structure can easily accommodate growth, both in terms of size and functionality.\n\nFor instance, some organizations may find the typical solution of centralizing large data centers too costly. Thus, bringing cloud connectivity closer to the source of the action, through a system called edge computing, is becoming more popular. With Red Hat, IBM has become the edge computing leader, potentially making International Business Machines stock more valuable.\n\nStory continues", "description": "On Wednesday , International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) stock did something unusual: it outpaced the stock market, closing up 1.7% against the Dow Jones' less than 1% move.
