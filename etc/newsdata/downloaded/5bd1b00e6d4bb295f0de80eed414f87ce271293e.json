A report in 2014 said 40 per cent of the energy use of the most popular consoles actually happened when players were not on them.\n\nStaying in a resting state allows the consoles to power up more quickly, as well as to download updates and other content at any time. But it also means that parts of the consoles must be consistently drawing power, using up energy despite nobody actually using the console.", "description": "The new PlayStation will be able to use far less power than the existing console, Sony has said.
