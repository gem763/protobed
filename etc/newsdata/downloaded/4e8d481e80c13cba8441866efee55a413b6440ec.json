Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for instance, said Saturday that \"Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply.\" En route to Saudi Arabia Wednesday, he called the strikes \"an Iranian attack\" and an \"act of war.\"\n\nPrince Khalid Bin Bandar Al-Saud, the Saudi Ambassador to London, told the BBC Wednesday that the drone and missile attacks on Saudi oil sites, attacks the US quickly blamed on Iran, were \"almost certainly Iran-backed\" strikes. But, he added, \"we are trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.\"\n\nAt a Saudi defense ministry press conference Wednesday, the military presented evidence of \"Iranian aggression\" and called the strikes \"an attack against the international community, the whole world economy, and global trade.\"\n\nThe Saudi military has, however, given no indication that it intends to retaliate with force. The Saudi military is capable of fighting Iran, but the attack exposed deep vulnerabilities in their major oil infrastructure and is forcing them to think twice about conflict, experts say.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia certainly has the more technologically-developed military compared to Iran. Most of Iran's stuff is decades behind what the Saudis purchase from the United States,\" Omar Lamrani, a senior military analyst with Stratfor told Insider.\n\n\"The Saudis can inflict a tremendous amount of pain on the Iranians, but they cannot stop the Iranians from doing the same,\" he explained, adding that \"Iran has less to lose than Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nIran is under tremendous pressure, and their economy has been severely crippled by sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. This situation makes the country much more willing to takes risks, such as mining oil tankers, pirating shipping routes, shooting down drones, or attacking energy facilities, all activities that have been linked to Iran, to signal its displeasure and force a change to the status quo.\n\nThe situation is different in Saudi Arabia, which has an economy vulnerable to Iranian attacks.\n\nThe Iranians \"have put their efforts into an asymmetric capability where they can still ensure, despite their relative conventional military weakness, they can still inflict heavy pain,\" Lamrani said, explaining that \"Iran understands that the Saudis could really damage Iran with their high-tech weapons, but Iran still has the ability to penetrate their defenses and really hurt their core economy, which is energy exports.\"\n\nHe explained that the Saudis are \"always extremely hesitant to escalate to a full-scale war\" because while they could destroy targets in Iran, \"that is not going to be much consolation when much of your energy infrastructure is in ruins.\"\n\nAt the core of current tensions is less the decades-old enmity between Iran and Saudi Arabia and more tensions between Iran and the US, Lamrani said, adding, \"This is a really tough position for Saudi Arabia to be in.\"", "description": "Saudi Arabia has said the attacks on its oil sites were \"unquestionably sponsored by Iran,\" but the country appears hesitant to escalate tensions.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d826dcb2e22af793340df64-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
