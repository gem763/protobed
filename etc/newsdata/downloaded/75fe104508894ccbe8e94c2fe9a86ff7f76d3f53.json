Zamna also said that International Airlines Group (IAG), Emirates Airlines and United Arab Emirates\u2019 General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs are now among its clients.\n\nAccording to company data website Crunchbase, the seed round was reportedly led by venture capital firms LocalGlobe and Oxford Capital partners alongside IAG, one of the world\u2019s largest airline groups.\n\nUp to 90% fewer document checks\n\nZamna, formerly known as Vchain Technology, aims to share passenger data between airports, governments and security firms via blockchain.\n\nThe platform says it will enable secure sharing between involved parties and provide instant passenger data checks, which is expected to reduce manual document checks up to 90%.\n\nA spokesperson of the startup explained:\n\n\u201cThe aspiration is that \u2014 as more passenger identities are verified digitally over time and shared securely between parties \u2014 the airport security process will become automated and passengers will be able to travel through the airport without needing any physical documentation or repeated ID checks.\u201d\n\nVerifying data without sharing it\n\nThe system reportedly allows for high privacy standards thanks to a proprietary algorithm capable of verifying biometric and biographic data without sharing it with third parties.\n\nThe platform \u201callows airlines, airports and governments to access a secure, immutable and distributed network of validations,\u201d the company claims, adding that:\n\n\u201cThe technology can be used by any of these parties to validate passengers biographic and biometric data, using cryptographically sound \u2018signals\u2019 to check you are who you say you are.\u201d\n\nZamna co-founder and CEO, Irra Ariella Khi, notes that airlines are currently unable to provide accurate data to governments in accordance with the regulations. She said that both the airlines and the governments would need to spend a vast amount of resources to verify who should or should not be allowed to a given country.\n\nAccording to her, this should all be automated in the digital age saying,\n\n\u201cIn 2019, these decisions should be securely automated and informed by high integrity data \u2014 long before the journey even begins.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in March, a representative from the United States Customs and Border Protection previously said that using blockchain for biometric tracking would be the technology\u2019s killer app in the travel security sector.", "description": "Blockchain startup Zamna raised $5 million to automate airport security checks with blockchain and biometrics", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZTkwZWI5YWQyZjI1ZDdlM2QzMTRkN2FkNzA4YTkzZDYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
