You can watch the full interview here and get my two cents about economic forecasting, as well as Keynesian monetary policy.\n\nIn this segment, you can see that I\u2019m also worried about a return of Keynesian fiscal policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s examine the issue, starting with an analogy.\n\nAccording to the Urban Dictionary, a bad penny is a \u201cthing which is unpleasant, disreputable, or otherwise unwanted, especially one which repeatedly appears at a bad time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a good description of Keynesian economics, which is the strange notion that the government can provide \u201cstimulus\u201d by borrowing money from some people, giving it to other people, and assuming that society is then more prosperous.\n\nKeynesianism has a long track record\u2026of failure.\n\nNow the bad penny is showing up again.\n\nDonald Trump already has been pushing Keynesian monetary policy, and the Washington Post reports that he is now contemplating Keynesian fiscal policy.\n\nSeveral senior White House officials have begun discussing whether to push for a temporary payroll tax cut as a way to arrest an economic slowdown\u2026 The payroll tax was last cut in 2011 and 2012, to 4.2 percent, during the Obama administration as a way to encourage more consumer spending during the most recent economic downturn. \u2026Payroll tax cuts have remained popular with Democrats largely because they are seen as targeting working Americans and the money is often immediately spent by consumers and not saved. \u2026In the past, Democrats have strongly supported payroll tax cuts, while Republicans have been more resistant. Republicans have complained that such cuts do not help the economy.\n\nAs I wrote back in 2011, it\u2019s possible that a temporary reduction in the payroll tax rate could have some positive impact. After all, the marginal tax rate on work would be lower.\n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be a large effect, and whatever benefit wouldn\u2019t accrue for Keynesian reasons. Consumer spending is a symptom of a strong economy, not the cause of a strong economy.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at another nation.\n\nGermany was actually semi-sensible during the last recession, resisting the siren song of Keynesianism.\n\nBut now politicians in Berlin are contemplating a so-called stimulus.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal opines against this type of fiscal backsliding.\n\nThe German Finance Minister said Sunday he might possibly\u2026cobble together a Keynesian stimulus package for his recession-menaced country. \u2026Berlin invites this stimulus pressure as the only large eurozone government responsible enough to live within its means. A balanced budget and government debt below 60% of GDP encourage the International Monetary Fund\u2026to call for Berlin to \u201cuse\u201d its fiscal headroom to avert a recession. \u2026Germany\u2019s record on delivering projects quickly is lousy, as with Berlin\u2019s perennially delayed new airport. Too few projects would arrive in time to stimulate the new business investment proponents say would save Germany from an imminent downturn, if they stimulate business investment at all. \u2026The worst idea, though one of the more likely, is some form of cash-for-clunkers tax handout to support the auto industry.\n\nThe right answer, as I said in the above interview, is to adopt sensible pro-market reforms.\n\nThe main goal is faster long-run growth, but such policies also help in the short run.\n\nAnd the WSJ identifies some of those reforms for Germany.\n\nCutting taxes in Germany\u2019s overtaxed economy would be a faster and more effective stimulus\u2026 The main stimulus Germany needs is deregulatory. In the World Bank\u2019s latest Doing Business survey, Germany ranked behind France on time and cost of starting a business, gaining construction permits and trading across borders. Germany also lags on investor protections and ease of filing tax returns. A dishonorable mention goes to Mrs. Merkel\u2019s Energiewende (energy transformation), which is driving up costs for businesses already struggling with trade war, taxes and regulation. \u2026these problems don\u2019t require \u20ac50 billion to fix, and scrapping the Energiewende would save Berlin and beleaguered businesses and households money. The bad news for everyone is that Berlin is more likely to fall for a quick-fix chimera and waste the \u20ac50 billion.\n\nThe bottom line is that Keynesian economics won\u2019t work. Not in the United States, and not in Germany.\n\nBut politicians can\u2019t resist this failed approach because they can pretend that their vice \u2013 buying votes by spending other people\u2019s money \u2013 is actually a virtue.\n\nIn other words, \u201cpublic choice\u201d in action.", "description": "I was interviewed yesterday about the possibility of a recession .09/02/2019 3:18:30AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
