But that\u2019s not going to stop the government from pretending they\u2019re effective!\n\nIn case you missed it, the Trump administration has announced its plan to let a bunch of states incorporate wellness programs into the insurance plans they offer on the individual market, as The Wall Street Journal reported last week.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims it is doing this in order to help people get healthier and save the states some money.\n\n\u201cAllowing states to implement these wellness programs in their individual markets offers the opportunity to not only improve the health of their residents but also to help reduce health-care spending,\u201d said CMS administrator Seema Verma, per WSJ.\n\nBut according to critics, workplace wellness programs\u2014like reducing premiums for workers who take smoking cessation courses or go to the gym regularly\u2014accomplish neither of those goals Verma stated.\n\nMultiple studies in recent years have found that workers who participate in these programs do not show any \u201csignificant differences\u201d in their overall health\u2014to say nothing of the fact that a person\u2019s health cannot always be quantified by data and metrics, as labor organizer Lena Solow recently argued in The New Republic.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, such measures aren\u2019t even proven to lower health care costs for employers. A new study published this year by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that wellness programs implemented among the approximately 33,000 employees at BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club did not lead to the reduction in health care costs that the company had hoped for. If these programs don\u2019t save employers money, it\u2019s unlikely they would magically do so for state governments.\n\n\u201cThe verdict is clear,\u201d Los Angeles Times business columnist Michael Hiltzik wrote last week. \u201c[Wellness programs] don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nSo, it looks like we\u2019ll be getting a money-saving wellness program that won\u2019t save our government any money or make us well. Why are we trying to do this again?\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Harron Walker on Twitter .", "description": "Reducing insurance premiums for employees who engage in \"healthy\" behaviors benefits few people in practice.
