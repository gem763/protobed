In addition to being a journalist, Stengel later worked in the State Department from 2013 to 2016. He says it\u2019s the latter experience which made him question the wisdom of the First Amendment:\n\nAs a government official traveling around the world championing the virtues of free speech, I came to see how our First Amendment standard is an outlier. Even the most sophisticated Arab diplomats that I dealt with did not understand why the First Amendment allows someone to burn a Koran. Why, they asked me, would you ever want to protect that? It\u2019s a fair question. Yes, the First Amendment protects the \u201cthought that we hate,\u201d but it should not protect hateful speech that can cause violence by one group against another. In an age when everyone has a megaphone, that seems like a design flaw.\n\nWhat he\u2019s endorsing here is, of course, the heckler\u2019s veto. No one should be allowed to insult Islam or burn a Koran or draw a cartoon of the prophet because that might \u201ccause violence.\u201d And indeed it has caused violence. Sadly, the lesson Stengel takes from incidents like the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris is that they shouldn\u2019t have been allowed by law to doodle someone else\u2019s religious figure. By doing so, they caused the violence that killed 12 people. It wasn\u2019t the terrorists\u2019 fault, it was the cartoonists. No doubt there are a lot of religious extremists and a few would-be terrorists who would agree with Stengel.\n\nThe amendment rests on the notion that the truth will win out in what Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas called \u201cthe marketplace of ideas.\u201d This \u201cmarketplace\u201d model has a long history going back to 17th-century English intellectual John Milton, but in all that time, no one ever quite explained how good ideas drive out bad ones, how truth triumphs over falsehood. Milton, an early opponent of censorship, said truth would prevail in a \u201cfree and open encounter.\u201d A century later, the framers believed that this marketplace was necessary for people to make informed choices in a democracy. Somehow, magically, truth would emerge. The presumption has always been that the marketplace would offer a level playing field. But in the age of social media, that landscape is neither level nor fair.\n\nHe\u2019s wrong about the level playing field. Social media makes the playing field far more level for more people than it has ever been. The problem isn\u2019t the playing field, it\u2019s that there are a lot of people in the world, many of whom have a lot of ideas we don\u2019t like. And now, because of social media, those people are able to make themselves heard.\n\nIt\u2019s true that real people don\u2019t automatically jump from bad ideas to good ones. Sometimes they jump the opposite way and sometimes they refuse to adopt good ones for other reasons having to do with self-perception or tribalism. Cultural cognition is real and is a serious challenge to the idea that the marketplace of ideas will automatically result in better ideas and better people.\n\nBut the alternative, a government-regulated market in which some things cannot be said, guarantees that some important truths will never be spoken to people who should hear them. Criticisms of the Koran or the Bible from inside or outside those faiths should never be limited. People have a right to their own beliefs but shouldn\u2019t have a right to keep them insulated from other people\u2019s ideas in public.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to imagine being able to make groups like the KKK illegal with the stroke of a pen and thereby stamping them out. But would it really stamp them out or would it just add a thrill of the forbidden to them? I don\u2019t think this possibility can be minimized. Part of what people who join extremist groups are looking for is a sense of transgressing polite boundaries. Making such speech illegal would only make it that much more appealing to some.\n\nStengel began his piece by talking about \u201csophisticated Arab diplomats\u201d who wonder what benefit can possibly come from the First Amendment. I would ask Stengel this question: By limiting speech, have the countries those diplomats represent eliminated violent extremism? Have they eliminated anti-Semitism? Have they ensured civil rights for women? For gay citizens? I don\u2019t know what countries he has in mind but I think it\u2019s likely the answer to all of the above questions is no.\n\nThat\u2019s not a coincidence. Once you\u2019ve accepted that some ideas should not be spoken, that principle will inevitably go beyond the Koran as an object to the ideas contained in the Koran. Ideas about women, men, sex, freedom, good, evil, etc. Freedom of speech is messy and sometimes even counter-productive but it\u2019s still better for individuals and for societies than the alternative.", "description": "Another endorsement of the heckler's veto.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/washingtonpost.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
