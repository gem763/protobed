Martinez homered for the Red Sox, who lost their third straight.\n\nJohn Means (12-11) recovered from a rough start and pitched five solid innings for the Orioles, allowing three runs on five hits. He walked two and struck out five.\n\nMartin and Stewart drove in two runs apiece and Mancini capped off the day with a solo homer to right in the ninth, his team-high 35th of the season.\n\nBogaerts and Martinez hit back-to-back homers for Boston in the first, when the Red Sox took a 3-2 lead.\n\nMartin\u2019s solo homer in the second tied it and N\u00fa\u00f1ez put Baltimore ahead again in the third with a towering shot over the Green Monster, his second homer of the series and 31st of the season.\n\nBoston loaded the bases with one out in the seventh, but Branden Kline got out of the jam when Brock Holt grounded into a double play.\n\nJhoulys Chac\u00edn (3-12) lasted just 2 2/3 innings for Boston. He allowed four runs on five hits, struck out three and walked one.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nOrioles: RF Anthony Santander missed his fourth straight game. Manager Brandon Hyde said Santander was banged up heading into the series.\n\nRed Sox: LF Andrew Benintendi was out of the lineup for the second straight game. Benintendi hasn\u2019t played since leaving Thursday\u2019s game at Texas in the fourth inning after fouling a pitch off his right calf.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRed Sox LHP Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez (19-6, 3.76 ERA) tries to become the club\u2019s first lefty to win 20 games since Mel Parnell went 21-8 in 1953. The Orioles had not yet named a starter for the season finale.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Renato N\u00fa\u00f1ez homered in his second straight game and was one of four Baltimore players to go deep as the Orioles beat the Boston Red Sox 9-4 on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Alden"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/orioles_red_sox_baseball_05224_c0-152-3620-2262_s1770x1032.jpg?5b9d8d51bdd6eb6e11d4d49d9e8328d07f9c653a", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
