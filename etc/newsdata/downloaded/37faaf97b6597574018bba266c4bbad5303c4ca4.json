But now that summer\u2019s done, the final domestic box office numbers show just how dominant Disney was.\n\nOf the $4.31 billion grossed from the first weekend of May through Labor Day weekend, $1.83 billion came from movies distributed by Disney. That\u2019s a market share of 42%, up from an already strong 33% last year.\n\nAlso Read: Disney+ Subscriptions Could Double Disney's Projections, New Survey Shows\n\nKeep in mind that these figures don\u2019t factor in the record-obliterating opening week of \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d which hit theaters on April 26 and grossed $537 million at the domestic box office before the summer season \u201cofficially\u201d began. If that week of box office grosses is included, the overall summer total increases to $4.84 billion, and Disney\u2019s share increases to 47% with $1.83 billion.\n\nDisney\u2019s strong performance had been expected for a long time. Between \u201cEndgame,\u201d \u201cToy Story 4,\u201d and remakes of \u201cAladdin\u201d and \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d the studio had been expected to blow by the industry records it has set over the past few years. By the end of July, Disney\u2019s global grosses for 2019 already passed the $7.67 billion record it had set in 2018.\n\nAlso Read: Fox's Future Under Disney May Hinge on 'Ford vs. Ferrari'\n\nBut its strong market share also came from a lack of major blockbuster competitors from other studios. Summer 2018 had hits like Universal\u2019s \u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u201d and multiple mid-budget, $100 million-plus hits from Warner Bros. like \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d to complement the mega-hits Disney was putting out.\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 big blockbuster \u201cGodzilla: King of the Monsters\u201d did not meet the $200 million total of the studio\u2019s 2014 \u201cGodzilla\u201d with just $110 million grossed. And while Universal has found solid success with \u201cSecret Life of Pets 2\u201d and the Fast & Furious spinoff \u201cHobbs & Shaw,\u201d neither film provided the $300 million-plus jolt to overall totals that previous installments in their respective franchises did.\n\n\u201cThe summer of 2018 was more balanced than 2018 in the sense that other studios had massive franchise films like \u2018Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,\u2019 \u2018Deadpool 2\u2019 and \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u2019 that earned a combined $940 million in North America,\u201d said comScore\u2019s Paul Dergarabedian. \u201cThis year, the top 3 non-Disney summer hits were \u2018Spider-Man: Far From Home,\u2019 \u2018John Wick 3\u2019 and \u2018The Secret Life of Pets 2\u2019 that grabbed up a combined $714 million.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Disney+ TV Shows to Stream Episodes Weekly - Won't Be Dropped All at Once\n\nBehind Disney, the studio with the second largest market share this summer was Sony, thanks in large part to the now-terminated partnership it had with Disney and Marvel Studios. The final film in that partnership, \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home,\u201d is the only film among the top five highest grossing movies of this summer that wasn\u2019t produced by Disney, grossing $385 million domestically and becoming Sony\u2019s highest grossing film ever with over $1.1 billion worldwide.\n\nAdd the rest of the slate led by the $131 million grossed by Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood,\u201d and Sony\u2019s market share sits at 14.6% with $632 million grossed.\n\nThe 2020 summer slate is expected to be a big drop from the highs of 2018 and 2019, simply because Disney won\u2019t be putting out an \u201cAvengers\u201d movie or a sequel to a beloved Pixar franchise. They will still be a big factor though, as Marvel Studios will kick off the season with the long-awaited \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d while Pixar will return to making original films with the cosmic jazz odyssey \u201cSoul.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of Hollywood will have a chance to reduce the market share disparity we\u2019ve seen this summer. Warner Bros. in particular is in a strong position next year with \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cTenet,\u201d packing the one-two punch of a superhero sequel and an auteur-driven original title that Sony brought this year.\n\nRead original story Disney Films Made 42% of This Summer\u2019s Box Office Grosses At TheWrap", "description": "It\u2019s no secret that Disney was in full control of the summer blockbuster season.
