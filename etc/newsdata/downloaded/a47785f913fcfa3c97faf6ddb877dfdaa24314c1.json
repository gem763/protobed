The subliminal pressure to be \u201cperfect\u201d is no longer subliminal, and it\u2019s putting more more of a strain on young users more than ever.\n\nThis is why Instagram is planning to remove all AR filters that depict or are associated with cosmetic surgery. Over the past few months, filters like \u201cPlastica\u201d \u2014 an effect that gives you extreme plastic surgery \u2014 have become increasingly popular, even viral. But with their rapid popularity comes growing concerns over the impact they may have on young people\u2019s body image.\n\nThis plastica filter is giving me inspiration for the future pic.twitter.com/wP1OzsAicl \u2014 WEAR EYE CREAM (@ruqaiya_h) August 10, 2019\n\nBack in August, Facebook announced its (previously invite-only) tool to create face filters \u2014 Spark AR Creators \u2013 was open to the public, allowing anyone to create and publish effects for use in Instagram Stories. With this came a flood of more problematic filters, such as \u201cFix Me\u201d an effect which illustrates the pen-markings of pre-surgery, including a nose job, eyebrow lift, and cheek fillers.\n\nView this post on Instagram fix me filter just out \u2013 come live your plastic surgery fantasy A post shared by DANIEL MOONEY (@danielmooney) on May 24, 2019 at 7:58am PDT\n\nAlthough Spark AR didn\u2019t design the filter, it did approve the filter to be used by its one billion users on Instagram Stories. A post published by Spark AR Creators stated that it wants its filters \u201cto be a positive experience and are re-evaluating its existing policies as they relate to well-being.\u201d While its policies are being reviewed and updated, Facebook is removing existing filters like \u201cFix Me,\u201d and postponing the approval of any similar new effects.\n\nThis news comes shortly after Facebook and Instagram announced they will tighten their policy on posts related to cosmetic surgery and weight loss products by hiding related posts from users known to be aged under 18. This update includes the removal of any content that makes a \u201cmiraculous\u201d claim about a diet or weight-loss product linked to a commercial offer, such as a discount code or affiliate link.\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring to see Instagram and Facebook take responsibility for what they\u2019ve been hosting, but it remains to be seen how proactively they will respond to issues of mental and physical health in the future.", "description": "Instagram plans to remove filters that depict plastic surgery.
