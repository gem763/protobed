But it burned through hundreds of millions of dollars and failed to find a business model that didn't lead to massive losses.\n\nDuring MoviePass' collapse, CEO Mitch Lowe locked some subscribers out of their accounts and used other tactics to try and keep the company running, according to multiple inside sources who Business Insider spoke with during a four-month investigation into the company's practices, which was published in August.\n\nMoviePass, along with Moviefone and MoviePass Films, which are all owned by Helios and Matheson, will be up for sale, the company said on Friday.\n\nHelios and Matheson's \"board of directors has formed a strategic review committee, composed entirely of the company's independent directors, to identify, review, and explore all strategic and financial alternatives for the company, including a sale of the company in its entirety,\" the company said.\n\nThis announcement came as Business Insider waited for comment from Helios and Matheson on a story that detailed the company's attempts to sell MoviePass and Moviefone and its continued layoffs.\n\nThe Friday before the Labor Day holiday weekend, the Moviefone editor Drew Taylor sent out an email to the site's freelancers informing them that \"effective immediately all freelancing is suspended.\" The email, obtained by Business Insider, went on to say that Moviefone would make sure \"everybody gets paid what they're owed as soon as possible,\" but multiple sources said some freelancers had not been paid for months.\n\nTo read Business Insider's inside look at what's been going on recently at MoviePass and Moviefone, read our full story on Business Insider Prime.", "description": "The parent company of the movie-ticket-subscription service is looking for a sale of MoviePass, Moviefone, and MoviePass Films.", "authors": ["Jason Guerrasio", "Nathan Mcalone"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b62f9e6e199f318008b496f-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
