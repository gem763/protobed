An honours board lists their European exploits: Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finalists in 1974. Defeat by Benfica on away goals in the 1967-68 European Cup. No fewer than 11 campaigns in that elite continental competition.\n\nBut like many clubs north and south of the Irish border, they're struggling. The grand old team are semi-pro now and losing all their best players to England because they have never recovered from the catastrophic loss of entire generations of supporters during the Troubles.\n\nDundalk's Oriel Park holds only 4,500 fans for domestic games and 3,100 for European ties\n\nThe docklands were considered no-go areas, attendances plummeted from 40,000 to 2,000 these days, and the club's stadium is a throwback to the 1980s.\n\nThe sight of dozens of people wearing Liverpool, Manchester United and even Burnley tops in the departure lounge of Belfast's George Best Airport at 6.30am last Saturday revealed where supporters are drifting.\n\nIt was always going to take something bold to revive clubs in the north and south \u2014 who receive no share of their respective FAs' derisory TV deals \u2014 and a radical plan to be outlined at a cross-border meeting of teams on Thursday might just be it.\n\nThe proposal is to break down a divide spanning generations and create a 14-team All-Island league. There will be money, says tech entrepreneur Kieran Lucid, who has spent two years working on plans to persuade clubs across Ireland that they are better off together than apart.\n\nOriel Park does not befit a club who have been champions in five of the past six seasons\n\nHe anticipates revenues of \u20ac10million (\u00a38.8m) from a main sponsor, TV rights and other commercial deals \u2014 to be shared equally among clubs \u2014 with additional prize money based on league position and a fee for televised games. One broadcaster, rumoured to be streaming service DAZN, is said to have offered a seven-figure sum.\n\nClubs would be required to spend a significant amount of that money on stadium standards and marketing rather than on what Lucid calls 'an arms race for players'.\n\nBeyond the commercial considerations, there is the prospect of football bringing north and south together at a time when Brexit threatens the return of border posts and sectarian strife. Eight clubs from north and south have signed a declaration of interest.\n\nYet there are obstacles, some born of years of mutual suspicion and bigotry. No fans feel this more than those of staunchly Catholic Derry City \u2014 kicked out of the North's Irish League in 1971 when their ground was deemed unsafe for visiting Protestant teams.\n\nMost footballl clubs north and south of the Irish border are struggling at the moment\n\nSince 1985 they have been playing in southern Ireland's league, the only Northern Irish team to do so.\n\nAt the home of champions Dundalk, 50 miles south of the border, Derry's Pride of Northside Supporters group have just parked their 20-seater mini-bus near the pitch. They say they could not do that at some Loyalist clubs in the north, such as Belfast's Linfield.\n\n'It would be vandalised or torched,' says John Elliott, one of the group. 'It's even attacked when we're returning home from games. Loyalists wait on a bridge for us. Everyone knows our bus. Some of our supporters could cause trouble in an All-Island league, too. The ones who never knew the Troubles. They already do damage \u2014 jumping on the seats and wrecking them.'\n\nSupporters talk of how Brexit has dredged up a lot of old antagonism. 'Hatred sells,' says one. However, very few of these fans believe the old divides should be an impediment to the new league. 'Look at what's happened to rugby since the Good Friday Agreement was signed,' says supporter Shelagh Laverty. 'Football's way behind when it's the sport best placed to bring this island together.'\n\nClubs on Thursday will discuss a radical proposal to create a 14-team All-Island league\n\nDundalk chief executive Mark Devlin, the former Brentford CEO, has found an Irish game stagnating, when the population and potential audience could put it on a level with innovative nations like Denmark. 'We should be doing better than Scotland on the basis of socio-economic factors,' Devlin says. 'We should be looking to play our elite sport in great stadiums, building a fanbase including young people, women and families.'\n\nHe admits that Dundalk's Oriel Park does not befit a club who have been Irish champions in five of the past six seasons. 'The new league could mean big clubs playing meaningful games, week-in, week-out, in full stadiums.\n\n'It can also bring the country together. With Brexit looming, it's a good time.'\n\nThe North are interested, too, though more cautiously. This is all such a diplomatic minefield that simply calling the league 'All-Ireland' rather than 'All-Island' risks causing offence. 'We're interested,' Glentoran chairman Stephen Henderson, says of the proposed new league.\n\nHe and others want to know whether their revenue share will offset the likely loss of one of the island's eight European places if two elite leagues become one. These fleeting campaigns in the Europa League are so vital that they even made their league a summer one, in 2003, in part to improve performance in Europe.\n\nGeorge Best turned out for Glentoran in a 1982 centenary friendly against Manchester United\n\nThe \u00a3250,000 winnings from a Europa League third qualifying round are considered lucrative, though Devlin admits it is a curious kind of existence. 'We want to play our own elite sport here,' he says, 'not get excited if we win one game in Europe.'\n\nThe Football Association of (southern) Ireland blocked similar plans for a united Irish league in 2007, despite clubs backing it, but is now in financial disarray, so Dundalk and others clubs have formed a working party.\n\nUEFA are thought to be receptive but the two sides' calendars must be brought together. An April start and a finish on New Year's Day seems to be the plan, with the Boxing Day programme, which is key to the northern clubs, intact. The legendary Glentoran/Linfield derby is always played on that day.\n\n'Whatever happens, we want to show that the game and the country has moved on,' says Glentoran's Henderson. 'We don't care who you love, or who you pray to. We love football. We want our game to make up all the ground it lost in the dark years.'", "description": "IAN HERBERT FROM BELFAST: A few minor blemishes aside - rejecting George Best as 'too small', for example - Glentoran are testament to the power of football in the lands of the working class.", "authors": ["Ian Herbert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/19/20049086-0-image-a-14_1571768524613.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
