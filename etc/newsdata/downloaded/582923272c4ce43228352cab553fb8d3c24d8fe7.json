All the wholesale deliveries, to local restaurants, delis, cafes, pubs and hotels, are run by electric bike.\n\n\"It's pretty overwhelming to be honest,\" Strang told the Telegraph. \"I was hoping we'd get one of the categories, but to get the overall winner was a really nice moment. To be chosen as the best is pretty amazing.\"\n\nStephen Hallam, a master baker, managing director of Dickinson & Morris, and chair of the judges, said: \"Andy Strang's Hippy Bread was made with a blend of organic wheat and rye flour. It was packed with sunflower, pumpkin and poppy seeds and was fermented for 48 hours. It was the loaf that ticked all the boxes; it looked good, had a wonderful aroma and in terms of flavour it had the wow factor.\"", "description": "A Kentish Town-based, crowdfunded baker has picked up the top prize at the seventh Tiptree World Bread Awards (limited to Britain, despite its name), in a ceremony held at St John's Church in Hyde Park, London.", "authors": ["Tom\u00e9 Morrissy-Swan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2019/10/16/unnamed-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq56SURFa-j0RBa9h9sFlLKWtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
