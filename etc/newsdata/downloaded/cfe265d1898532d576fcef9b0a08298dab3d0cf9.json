The small period after half-time: ridiculous mistakes, poor decisions, lack of covering back.\u201d\n\nAsked if the individual errors were just a lack of concentration rather than anything more fundamental, the England boss said: \u201cI think that is something that we have to consider over a period of time because there were obviously mistakes that were concerning, really.\n\n\u201cWhether it was the intensity of the game, whether it was the pressure, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve got to reflect on that, but they were such basic errors, really, that you have to learn from.\u201d\n\nThere are no such problems at the other end of the field, with his attacking trio showing just why Southgate considers his forwards among the world\u2019s best.\n\n\u201cRaheem, Jadon and Harry were outstanding,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean Raheem\u2019s two performances have been of the highest level.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been almost unstoppable, his awareness of where defenders were, his ability to ride challenges, his vision and desire to get in on goal, and unselfish play as well, so I couldn\u2019t speak highly enough of the way he played.\n\n\u201cYou know we were talking about the three on Saturday, Jadon\u2019s performance was at that level as well.\n\n\u201cHe worked really hard for the team without the ball and showed the ability he has to go past people, to be calm in tight areas. So, that part of our game was absolutely outstanding.\u201d\n\nEccentric counterpart Bernard Challandes joked it was a shame that Sterling was not Kosovan \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s impossible to play against him or you do a foul\u201d \u2013 and was pleased with his side\u2019s display at St Mary\u2019s.\n\n\u201cOK, we have decided to try to play football, to take risk and we have seen in the first half how strong England is,\u201d the Kosovo head coach said.\n\n\u201cWe have tried, we have played, we have also lost some unnecessary balls and we have paid immediately because the counters of England were very, very beautiful.\n\n\u201cOur idea was immediately to press England for surprise and, OK, we win this ball \u2013 or they give us the ball \u2013 it\u2019s 1-0. It\u2019s perfect for us.\n\n\u201cBut after clearly England were very strong and played a very good half.\n\n\u201cSecond half was good for us. If I do British humour, we have won 2-0 and who has won 2-0 against England in one half? Who is the last team?\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Gareth Southgate was concerned by some of England\u2019s defensive mistakes on a night when his attackers\u2019 devastating performance saw off Kosovo in a thrilling Euro 2020\u00a0qualifying clash.
