Thank goodness the Switch has a smartly-designed zoom feature.\n\nNintendo added the zoom option in April, but it remains very easy to miss. That\u2019s too bad, because it can dramatically improve the experience of playing games in handheld mode.\n\nInstead of squinting to read an item description in Dragon Quest Builders 2\u2026\n\n\u2026 you can just zoom in.\n\nBethesda\u2019s 2016 Doom game runs really well in the Switch\u2019s handheld mode, but what if you want to read the game\u2019s lore text? Sure, sure, reading Doom lore isn\u2019t that important, but just imagine that it is. Better to zoom in when you do.\n\nHere\u2019s how to get the zoom feature to work:\n\nFirst, you need to go into the Switch\u2019s System settings under the general settings menu and turn the Zoom option on.\n\nThis sets up the option to double-tap the home button in order to have a zoom interface appear while using the Switch. Note that the zoom works system-wide, so you can use it in any game, while browsing the eShop or \u2014 this might be too meta \u2014 while tweaking the system\u2019s settings.\n\nIt\u2019s most handy when playing a game. You\u2019re playing through, say, The Witcher 3 and you decide to read one of the in-game lore books. The text for those isn\u2019t that tiny, but some zoom might help.\n\nSo, double-tap the home button and the zoom interface will appear.\n\nThe game does not pause when you do this, but it suspends the normal functions of the system\u2019s sticks and buttons. Instead of controlling your character or the game\u2019s menus, that double-tap on the home button puts you in control of the zoom itself. The X and Y buttons zoom the game\u2019s graphics in or out, while the left control stick positions the zoomed image. In the case of the Witcher books, the lore is displayed off to the right. Properly adjusted, the zoom looks like this:\n\nThat level of zoom can be locked in place with another tap of the home button. Doing that causes the system\u2019s sticks and buttons to go back to controlling the game. You can then play the game while you are zoomed in, which isn\u2019t that useful unless there\u2019s some game that really isn\u2019t using a chunk of the screen for anything.\n\nDouble-tapping the home button cancels the zoom and makes the game display in full again.\n\nThe Switch remembers the last positioning you used with the zoom function, which means that you can set up a preferred zoom and then repeatedly switch to it and away from it with double-taps of the home button. You could use this to, perhaps, easily zoom into the mini-map for a moment while playing an action-adventure.\n\nIn a perfect world, the Switch\u2019s screen resolution is high enough, game designer\u2019s user interface design is merciful enough and your vision is good enough that you wouldn\u2019t need to use the Switch\u2019s zoom function. We don\u2019t live in that world, but we do live in one with some really good games that almost have no problems on the Switch.\n\nIf the problem they do have is tiny text, mastering the system\u2019s zoom function should make things a lot better.", "description": "It\u2019s great that the Nintendo Switch can play so many excellent games on the go, but some games have menus that can be as hard to read as the fine print on a food label.
