(Jacopo Raule/Getty Images for Gucci)\n\nEverything was white: the walls that the Gucci models slid past, the conveyor belt they stood on, the prisonlike sandals they wore on their feet and the straitjackets that covered their unmoving bodies.\n\nBefore Gucci brought out patterns and lace and loud colors at Milan Fashion Week, the blank slate and bland clothing were meant to represent \u201cthe most extreme version of a uniform dictated by society and those who control it,\u201d according to Gucci.\n\nDesigner Alessandro Michele made the \u201cblank-styled clothes to represent how through fashion, power is exercised over life, to eliminate self-expression,\u201d Gucci wrote on Instagram. \u201cThis power prescribes social norms, classifying and curbing identity.\u201d\n\nSo, during the opening of the Gucci show in Milan on Sunday afternoon, the label\u2019s 20 models, somber and staring blankly ahead, moved past onlookers with their arms limp at their sides \u2014 all but one.\n\nAyesha Tan-Jones, who is non-binary, raised their arms.\n\n\u201cMENTAL HEALTH,\u201d Tan-Jones\u2019s palms read in black marker, \u201cIS NOT FASHION.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Not a cute fashion accessory\u2019: Gucci\u2019s $800 \u2018Indy Full Turban\u2019 draws backlash]\n\nTan-Jones did not immediately respond to an interview request but said in statements posted to Instagram after the fashion show that they decided to protest because \u201cI believe, as many of my fellow models do, that the stigma around mental health must end.\u201d\n\nAs someone who has struggled with mental health, and as someone with loved ones who have experienced bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety and schizophrenia, Tan-Jones wrote that \u201cit is hurtful and insensitive for a major fashion house such as Gucci to use this imagery as a concept for a fleeting fashion moment.\u201d\n\nTan-Jones continued:\n\n\"Straight Jackets are a symbol of a cruel time in medicine when mental illness was not understood, and people\u2019s rights and liberties were taken away from them while they were abused and tortured in the institution. It is in bad taste for Gucci to use the imagery of straight jackets and outfits alluding to mental patients, while being rolled out on a conveyor belt as if a piece of factory meat. Presenting these struggles as props for selling clothes in today\u2019s capitalist climate is vulgar, unimaginative and offensive to the millions of people around the world affected by these issues.\" Ayesha Tan-Jones\n\nTan-Jones said in a separate statement that they were not alone in their criticism of Gucci\u2019s depiction of asylum clothing as art.\n\n\u201cMany of the other Gucci models who were in the show felt just as strongly as I did about this depiction of straitjackets, and without their support I would not have had the courage to walk out and peacefully protest,\u201d Tan-Jones said, adding that they had joined other models in donating a portion of their show payments to mental health charities.\n\nRepresentatives from Gucci did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in their statement on Instagram after the show they made clear that the white outfits that started the show will not be sold and were included only as part of the performative art. Those outfits, including the straitjackets, were meant as a juxtaposition with Michele\u2019s colorful spring and summer collection, the account said, which he designed to convey \u201cfashion as a way to allow people to walk through fields of possibilities, cultivate beauty, make diversity sacrosanct and celebrate the self in expression and identity.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Haute Couture Blackface\u2019: Gucci apologizes and pulls \u2018racist\u2019 sweater]\n\nMichele told the New York Times after the show that he \u201cwanted to show how society today can have the ability to confine individuality and that Gucci can be the antidote.\"\n\n\u201cFor me, the show was the journey from conformity to freedom and creativity,\u201d Michele told the Times.\n\nMichele, an Italian designer who was appointed Gucci\u2019s creative director in 2015, has faced criticism in the past for other \u201cmake it fashion\u201d moments that were characterized as insensitive.\n\nIn February, Gucci issued an apology and pulled a wool balaclava jumper that retailed for $890 from its shelves after online critics accused the turtleneck of mimicking blackface. The brand also faced a backlash for putting white models in turbans as if the Sikh religious headwear was nonsecular fashion and later selling them in stores for hundreds of dollars.\n\nAfter those uproars, Gucci formed an advisory council and made plans to hire a global director for diversity and inclusion.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018I was the person who made the mistake\u2019: How Gucci is trying to recover from its blackface sweater controversy\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 loves his work.
