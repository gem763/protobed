But it is also a fountain of strength economically, offering opportunity for specialisation that multiplies gains from trade for growth.\n\nGrowing economic security attenuated the politics of ASEAN and Asian diversity and ensured its reach and influence \u2014 though at times it may have appeared tenuous. It will be economic security and success that underpins Asia\u2019s political sway and effectiveness in the face of the great political uncertainties that confront the world today.\n\nThe APEC Bogor Goals of free and open trade by 2020, adopted in 1994, embodied a strategic commitment to the core pillars of economic openness. While completely free and open trade remains an aspiration in the region, APEC's continued commitment to openness has delivered substantial benefits to its members.\n\nThe global order has changed in ways that threaten the shared prosperity and security promoted by Asia\u2019s economic cooperation arrangements such as ASEAN, APEC and the East Asian arrangements. The change is a product of big shifts in the structure of global power, with the rise of China and other emerging economies now a cause of deep disquiet within the established powers.\n\nThe response to this and a withdrawal from globalisation are reflected in the surge in protectionism and retreat from multilateralism. This is exemplified in Europe through Brexit, by the Trump administration\u2019s \"America First\" policies on trade and investment, in China\u2019s reciprocated response to US policies, and a raft of negative regional and bilateral actions.\n\nRecent actions in the Asia Pacific \u2014 from the US\u2013China trade and technology war and tensions between South Korea and Japan \u2014 make it clear that something is broken.\n\nThese conflicts and trade-destroying strategies completely ignore or circumvent the established rules of international trade. Those rules have been in place since Bretton Woods Institutions were created and were strengthened when the World Trade Organisation was created in 1995.\n\nWhile there are big gaps in the rules and new issues to be dealt with, strategies that effectively tear down the established rules only corrode the open multilateral order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese developments are undermining trade and investment flows, disrupting supply chains, and causing long-term damage to the confidence and predictability that underpin cross-border commerce. The downturn in global foreign direct investment (dropping 23 per cent in 2017 and 18 per cent in 2018) illustrates this impact.\n\nFor South-east Asia \u2014 a region that has developed because of trade and where cross-border trade is heavily tethered to cross-border investment \u2014 these developments are critical and need an urgent and concerted response.\n\nThe global economic regime is in a time of crisis. Asia\u2019s central interest is to frame dialogue and an action plan that deals with this crisis directly. Tensions between protecting the global economic system and correcting the imbalances in that system must be resolved.\n\nRCEP is vital in shaping Asia and ASEAN\u2019s response to its new security circumstances. It encompasses China and India, the region\u2019s two big emerging powers. Although India was slow to grasp the strategic significance of RCEP \u2014 like ASEAN, Japan and other countries, it has now elevated early conclusion of RCEP as a foundational element in its quest for a new multipolar global order and embrace of Asia\u2019s dynamism.\n\nThrough RCEP\u2019s negotiation, when key ASEAN members leant towards leaving India behind, China and Japan did not waver from the strategic importance of keeping India in.\n\nRCEP is an ASEAN conception of the regional order, not a Chinese initiative. Like other ASEAN economic arrangements, RCEP is not merely another free trade agreement \u2014 it is an economic cooperation arrangement.\n\nLike all ASEAN-centred economic cooperation arrangements in Asia \u2014 and APEC which includes the United States \u2014 such arrangements are founded on political cooperation and underpin political security, as a collateral but primary international public good.\n\nMari Pangestu is Professor of Economics at the University of Indonesia, head of the Indonesian Bureau of Economic Research and a former Indonesian Minister of Trade and Tourism.
