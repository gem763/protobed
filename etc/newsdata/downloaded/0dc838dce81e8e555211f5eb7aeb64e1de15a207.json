Police said he was attacked by four unidentified men with hammers and knives on Wednesday.\n\nThere were fears late Sunday of another night of violence on the streets of Hong Kong where protesters and police have attacked each other with tear gas and petrol bombs for consecutive weekends for months.\n\nEarlier in the week, chief executive Carrie Lam was heckled out of the Legislative Council chamber while delivering an annual policy address that focused on the city\u2019s affordable housing shortage rather than tackling the political crisis engulfing the city for five months.\n\nSome metro stations were closed on Sunday as thousands prepared to rally in Tsim Sha Tsui. Local media said 15 per cent of the city's ATM machines were closed on the weekend after being vandalised by protesters targeting mainland Chinese banks.\n\nChan Tong-Kwai, a man accused of murdering his girlfriend whose case triggered the government's extradition bill that set off the protests, wrote to Ms Lam during the week saying he was willing to return to Taiwan. Mr Chan, whose case was raised by Ms Lam's administration as the reason for introducing an extradition agreement with China, is due to be released from prison in Hong Kong soon.\n\nHong Kong was relatively peaceful during the week. There was a peaceful gathering on Monday night to back US moves to remove Hong Kong's favourable trading status if it breaches human rights conditions and a prayer vigil Saturday night. However, a teenager was stabbed in the neck on Saturday while handing out political leaflets.", "description": "Protesters, many wearing masks in defiance of a government ban, gathered in Tsim Tsa Tsui across the harbour from Hong Kong Island on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2118%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_62/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f4e8f49db7fa151876f1365c1595e0bb9c762606", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
