He went to Tehran and didn't manage it. Now he's more powerful.\n\n\u201cNow I appreciate he's quite distracted and has got other things going on.\n\n\u201cBut actually this is an area where he can really make a difference. We looked to him once before to be our hero, and now he's got another chance.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe said it felt like Mr Johnson\u2019s advisors were keeping the Prime Minister \u201cat arms length\u201d from the story.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet's be honest, we're a bad news story for the Prime Minister. It might be a good news story one day, but at the moment we're a bad news story.\n\n\u201cSo I think his advisors were keeping him away.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI would expect a meeting. I've met him before, he was perfectly charming and decent when we met. He made that promise. It's time to deliver on it.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMr Zaghari Ratcliffe said he\u2019d felt a \u201cturmoil of feelings\u201d over Gabriella\u2019s return home.\n\nHe said it was a time for celebration that he had been reunited with his daughter for the first time since his wife\u2019s arrest in Iran three and a half years ago.\n\nBut he said he had spoken to Nazanin last night, and she was \u201creally upset.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things she didn\u2019t want to happen, for her daughter to leave and her still be stuck in prison.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut he added: \u201cOf course, seeing her late last night was lovely. And bless her, she\u2019s a bit shy and a bit traumatised and hasn\u2019t seen daddy for a long time.\n\n\u201cAnd there is a language problem. So it takes her a while to feel safe. But it\u2019s just lovely to have her back.\n\nGesturing to the next room, where his daughter was waiting, he said: \u201cWe were just negotiating what she wants to do this afternoon, and we went through various different options, and a toy shop was the one that landed. So a toy shop is where we\u2019re off to.\u201d\n\nMoments later there were gasps as Gabriella walked into the room, holding a cake.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe five-year-old's parents made the painful decision to bring her back from Iran so she can start school.\n\nMr Zaghari-Ratcliffe said they were still deciding which school she would be going to, but it would be one near to their home.\n\nAnd he said he wanted her to start school as soon as possible - maybe as soon as half-term, so they could become less of a \u201cTV family\u201d.", "description": "Richard Ratcliffe said he has asked for a meeting with Boris Johnson now five-year-old Gabriella has come back to go to school - but hasn't had a reply", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560270.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-IRAN-RIGHTS-PRISONERS-DIPLOMACY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
