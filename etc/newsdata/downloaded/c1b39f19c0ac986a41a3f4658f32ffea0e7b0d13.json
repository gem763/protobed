City Hall doesn\u2019t appear to read it all that closely, either. | AP Photo Uber's New York bike expansion stymied by dispute over court access\n\nIn exchange for expanding its popular bike share program in Staten Island, Uber wants New York City to let it severely limit riders' ability to sue the company.\n\nThe de Blasio administration is resisting.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTwo sources familiar with the matter told POLITICO that the dispute is a major reason New York City and Uber have yet to to sign a new contract to expand the company\u2019s dockless Jump bikes on Staten Island, where they have proven popular since they arrived in summer of 2018. The sources were given anonymity to discuss the matter freely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bigger success than we thought and we\u2019re trying to work with everybody to expand,\u201d said Staten Island Borough President Jimmy Oddo.\n\nEven as Uber is abandoning its bike share programs in other cities, it has expressed interest in expanding in Staten Island and, ultimately, citywide. The city, too, would like to experiment with a more ambitious dockless-bike pilot on Staten Island, where the city's official bike share operator, Citi Bike, has no presence.\n\nBut the \u201cforced arbitration\u201d policy that Uber wants to insert into its user agreements with riders is proving an obstacle. The increasingly commonplace corporate practice prevents users from seeking relief in court when something goes wrong. Consumer advocates deplore it, and so, increasingly, do some politicians.\n\nPresidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has said she would ban the practice. The House recently passed a bill that would do that, too. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who championed the measure, said it would help \u201cthe little guy against the giant corporation.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible problem, because it\u2019s undermining the rule of law,\u201d said George Slover, a senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports. \u201cWhatever protections you think you might have in the law are all trumped because you as the consumer ... are supposedly agreeing to give up all of your rights and take everything to arbitration.\u201d\n\nForced arbitration can also serve to hide operational problems from government regulators.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to license Uber bike, it needs to know if there are problems with Uber bike,\u201d said David Seligman, the executive director of Towards Justice, a consumer and worker advocacy group.\n\nAsked for comment, Uber spokesperson Harry Hartfield described the company\u2019s discussions with the city as \u201cproductive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the meantime bikes remain active while we try and find a way forward that works for everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dominant player in New York City\u2019s bike share economy is Lyft, which owns Citi Bike, a docked bike share system with a contract that it believes precludes competitors from operating in its zones. Its user agreement doesn\u2019t have a forced arbitration clause, though it does contain some contentious provisions of its own.\n\nWhen a rider signs up to use Citi Bike, that cyclist must sign a user agreement that governs her relationship with the company \u2014 including what would happen should she hurt herself while riding a Citi Bike.\n\nAccording to those provisions, should a rider seek to sue the company, she would first have to \u201csubmit the dispute to mandatory mediation held in New York State.\u201d Should the dispute not be resolved through mediation after six months, she could file suit in court.\n\n\u201cMediation provides our riders with a clear resolution process,\" said Lyft spokesperson Julie Wood.\n\nFurther, should Citi Bike sue a rider and win or secure a settlement, the rider would have to cover the company\u2019s court fees.\n\nMany riders don\u2019t read the user agreement before signing. City Hall doesn\u2019t appear to read it all that closely, either.\n\nTransportation department officials said they were unaware of those two provisions until POLITICO asked them for comment. Officials said they believed a former owner of Citi Bike inserted the provisions into the contact, but it was unable to provide more precision.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not pleased that the former operator inserted this language into the terms and conditions \u2014 we are generally fine with the concept of mediation, as long as there is no cost to the customer,\u201d said New York City Transportation Department spokesperson Scott Gastel. \u201cWe take issue with the attorneys\u2019 fees provision and will be addressing both matters with the current operator.\u201d\n\nMandatory mediation is not forced arbitration. In the former, riders can still access the courts. They just have to wait a while. But consumer advocates say it\u2019s still not ideal.\n\n\u201cWe have a system in place to enforce your rights, and that\u2019s through the courts, and courts will often encourage mediation anyways,\u201d Seligman said. \u201cCompanies shouldn\u2019t be using the fine print to create different obligations and different legal procedures for themselves.\u201d", "description": "Even as Uber is abandoning its bike share programs in other cities, it has expressed interest in expanding in Staten Island and, ultimately, citywide.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a2/e5/dba5f379495d9cb3b846aad1ca96/staten-island-ny.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
