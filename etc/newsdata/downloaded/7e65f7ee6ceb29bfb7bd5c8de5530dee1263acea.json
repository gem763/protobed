Graham: Trump is panicking\n\nBut just as Trump offered a quid pro quo to Zelensky, China has something to gain by currying favor with Trump. Beijing is embroiled in a trade war with the United States that has throttled the Chinese economy. Talks between the two governments have stalled. \u201cI have a lot of options on China, but if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power,\u201d Trump said a half minute before making the investigation request.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has openly requested that a foreign government intervene. During the 2016 election, he infamously called on Russia to attempt to hack into Hillary Clinton\u2019s computers. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said. By contrast, one of the most unusual things about his attempt to strong-arm Ukraine into investigating the Bidens was the White House\u2019s attempt to cover it up.Trump\u2019s remarks today marked a return to form.\n\nJust as Russia is a major intelligence adversary of the United States, China is already engaged in a massive spying operation against the U.S. Trump has been clear-eyed about the scale and cost of Chinese espionage against American companies. Yet, by inviting an investigation into the Bidens, Trump implies that he\u2019s extending a free pass, as he did with Russia three years ago.\n\nThe U.S. government does sometimes ask foreign governments for assistance in criminal investigations. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. Trump isn\u2019t requesting that China (or Ukraine) assist an existing FBI investigation. He\u2019s asking it to open its own investigation, which would hurt a political opponent. And crucially, he\u2019s doing so without ever actually lodging any accusation of criminal behavior.\n\nSarah Chayes: Hunter Biden\u2019s perfectly legal, socially acceptable corruption\n\nTrump appears to be referring to business dealings by Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son. In 2013, Hunter rode to Beijing with his father on Air Force Two. According to some accounts, he conducted business while on the trip. Regardless, it\u2019s clear that Hunter made lots of money in business deals in China, evidently by trading on his famous name. As Sarah Chayes recently wrote in The Atlantic, this is both gross and completely legal.\n\nEven Trump has not made any claim that Hunter or Joe broke any laws. \u201cNobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked,\u201d Trump said today. \u201cThat was a crooked deal, 100 percent.\u201d This is just bluster. Take such a vague accusation to any police station or prosecutor\u2019s office, and see how fast you get laughed back onto the street. If Trump has a claim of lawbreaking, he should bring it forward. Besides, it\u2019s hypocritical: Trump\u2019s own daughter has business interests in China that benefit from her father\u2019s fame and position.\n\nWhy would Trump so brazenly call on an American rival to interfere in the 2020 election, when he\u2019s already in grave danger for calling on a country to interfere in the election? Because he doesn\u2019t learn from his mistakes. Because his goal is not to defeat the impeachment inquiry, but to go around it. Because it worked for him in the 2016 election\u2014and since winning is his paramount value, he\u2019ll do whatever it takes to win in 2020, as well.", "description": "Facing impeachment over his secret request that Ukraine investigate the Bidens, the president appealed to China to do the same.", "authors": ["David A.
