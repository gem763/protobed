After national backlash, a judge erased his record.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nDeandre Somerville, 21, poses for a portrait on Oct. 3 in West Palm Beach, Fla. (Brynn Anderson/AP)\n\nThe judge said he wanted to teach 21-year-old Deandre Somerville \u201ca lesson\u201d for oversleeping and missing jury duty.\n\nSo Judge John S. Kastrenakes, a civil court judge in Palm Beach County, Fla., sentenced Somerville to 10 days in jail, a year of probation, 150 hours of community service, $223 in court costs and ordered him to write a letter of apology to the court.\n\n\u201cAfter going through that, my life will never be the same again,\u201d Somerville, who has no prior criminal history, told WPTV upon release from the 10-day jail stint last week.\n\nNow, following a weekend of reflection, Kastrenakes has apparently had a change of heart \u2014 notably just as Somerville\u2019s case began generating nationwide backlash.\n\nOn Friday, a remorseful Somerville appeared before Kastrenakes again to formally apologize while appealing his conviction for contempt of court. At first, Kastrenakes agreed to reduce Somerville\u2019s remaining sentence to three months of probation and 30 hours of community service.\n\nThen, on Saturday, he decided to rescind the remainder of Somerville\u2019s punishment and vacate his conviction for contempt as well.\n\nThe punishment had already served its purpose, Kastrenakes noted, while appearing to acknowledge that the purpose was to make an example out of Somerville. The young man was now clearly \u201ctotally rehabilitated,\u201d Kastrenakes wrote in the order to vacate filed online Monday.\n\n\u201cThe only reason the Court left him on a short term of probation was so that others could learn and take heed that serving on a jury is serious business deserving of attention, respect, and adherence to their oaths,\u201d Kastrenakes wrote. \u201cGiven the abundant publicity surrounding Mr. Somerville\u2019s case, I have concluded that the importance and seriousness of a sworn juror abiding by the law has been made clear. Therefore, there exists no reason to continue Mr. Somerville on probation.\u201d\n\nSomerville, who lives with his grandparents in West Palm Beach, Fla., and helps to care for his grandfather, showed up for jury selection in Kastrenakes\u2019s courtroom on Aug. 20. He was randomly selected to participate in the three-day negligence trial involving a car accident and ordered to come back the next day, according to court documents.\n\nBut he woke up sometime around 11 or 11:30 a.m. on Aug. 21 to find that he slept through the beginning of the trial, and decided he might as well go to work instead, he told the Associated Press. He didn\u2019t call the court to tell the judge why he wasn\u2019t there, and did not return subsequent phone calls from court staff, Kastrenakes wrote.\n\nSo Kastrenakes sent the police to serve Somerville with an order to appear in court to explain himself.\n\nHis grandfather told him to just be honest. His grandmother told him to dress nicely.\n\nSomerville, a West Palm Beach Parks and Recreation Department employee, said he wanted to wear his work uniform instead.\n\n\u201cI felt like at least he can see that I\u2019m doing something,\u201d Somerville told WPTV, \u201cbecause a lot of times people get stereotyped: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s just another black boy out here doing something he\u2019s not supposed to be doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the Sept. 20 contempt hearing, Kastrenakes began by scolding Somerville, asking him why he didn\u2019t come, according to a transcript. Somerville had no attorney representing him.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t know the seriousness of it, to be honest,\u201d Somerville explained. He added: \u201cI definitely owe you an apology.\u201d\n\nKastrenakes wasn\u2019t swayed, finding Somerville guilty of contempt and imposing a sentence widely viewed as excessive. Kastrenakes threatened more jail time on top of the 10 days if Somerville failed to complete his 150 hours of community service, at least 15 hours per month.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Kastrenakes told him. \u201cI\u2019m dead serious about this. Dead serious. If you don\u2019t do the community service hours as I\u2019ve ordered, you face up to six months in jail, all right? This is just a taste of jail and it\u2019s not that long.\u201d\n\nBut for the 21-year-old, it was \u201clong and traumatic,\u201d as he told BuzzFeed News on Friday. He was cuffed and turned over to the sheriff following the Sept. 20 hearing and released Sept. 29.\n\n\u201cTwenty-four hours in a day felt like 48 hours in a day,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News of the 10-day jail stay. \u201cI had to tell myself, I am not a criminal.\u201d\n\nAt the Friday hearing appealing his contempt conviction, in a courtroom packed with Somerville\u2019s family and friends, his mother testified that while in jail, her son couldn\u2019t sleep, didn\u2019t want to eat and witnessed beatings. He called her on the phone every day.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I can try to send you money,\u2019\" Annique Owens told WPTV, \u201cand he said, \u2018No, what I need from you is to answer the phone when I call. That\u2019s what I want, Mom, just answer the phone when I call.\u2019\u201d\n\nSomerville read aloud his letter of apology to the judge, taking full responsibility for the \u201cimmature decision\u201d that cost him his freedom, while fearing the consequences for the future.\n\n\u201cBefore my hearing I walked in the courtroom as a free man with no criminal record,\u201d Somerville said, WPTV reported. \u201cI left a criminal in handcuffs.\u201d\n\nThe judge said he appreciated Somerville\u2019s remorse, but still thought punishment was warranted, while agreeing to reduce it. He also further chastised Somerville for failing to appear for jury duty because of his race.\n\n\u201cHe was the only African-American on the jury, representing a cross-section of the community, and he decided on his own that it wasn\u2019t worth his time,\u201d Kastrenakes said Friday, the Sun Sentinel reported.\n\nOthers had a different take on that issue.\n\n\u201cYou know racism is bad in America when a black man can get thrown in jail at someone else\u2019s trial,\u201d Trevor Noah said on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Monday night.\n\nNoah added: \u201cWhat\u2019s even worse is that reason the judge gave. \u2026 In other words, he got sent to jail because he was the only black juror. So why not put him on another jury? Because that\u2019s where you say you need the black people. You know where you don\u2019t need more black people? In jail.\u201d\n\nA black man spends 10 days in jail for missing his first day of jury duty. That\u2019s some M. Night Shyamalan twist ending racism. pic.twitter.com/fVtUuZk5sh \u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) October 8, 2019\n\nThe story gained national traction late last week as critics piled on. Some pointed out how a black man\u2019s sincere apology for sleeping in and missing court wasn\u2019t enough to earn forgiveness or a hug from the judge, alluding to the judge presiding over the murder trial of Amber Guyger. The former Dallas police officer was convicted of killing a black man in his own home, claiming she mistook his apartment for her own. The judge hugged the white woman after her sentencing last Wednesday.\n\nOthers wondered if a white man would have been punished the same way.\n\n10 days. He\u2019s spending the same amount of time in jail that parents who committed college bribery are spending. Why? Because he\u2019s black. https://t.co/WKHzFgiuej \u2014 Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) October 6, 2019\n\nBy Saturday, it appeared something had caused Kastrenakes to change his mind.\n\nHe insisted in his order vacating Somerville\u2019s conviction and sentence that he would have treated any person who skipped jury duty the same way, but said he doubted most would redeem themselves as quickly as Somerville.\n\n\u201cThe young man in court on October 4th was a vastly different person from the DeAndre Somerville who refused to come to court and intentionally violated his oath as a sworn juror,\u201d Kastrenakes wrote, adding finally: \u201cI do not want even a finding of contempt to be gleaned from a perusal of his background or record.\"\n\nKastrenakes said he was \u201cextremely impressed by his family\u2019s character, support and forthrightness,\u201d and found Somerville\u2019s apology \u201cmoving, sincere and heartfelt.\"\n\n\u201cI know he has been totally rehabilitated,\u201d Kastrenakes wrote, although the judge\u2019s reversal did little to quell critics.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t need rehabilitation,\u201d the King Center observed on Twitter.\n\nKastrenakes could not immediately be reached for comment early Tuesday morning.", "description": "\u201cYou know racism is bad in America when a black man can get thrown in jail at someone else\u2019s trial,\u201d Trevor Noah cracked on \u201cThe Daily Show\" Monday night.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter", "October At Am", "Meagan Flynn Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
