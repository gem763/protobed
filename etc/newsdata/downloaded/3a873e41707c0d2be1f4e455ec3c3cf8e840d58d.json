Dressing up for Halloween is a relatively recent tradition\n\nIt wasn't until the major emigration of the Irish to North America that Halloween crossed the Atlantic for the first time.\n\n\"In the twentieth century it exploded in size and Halloween in America became centred on fancy dress,\" Dr Sneddon explained.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The modern image of friendly, or comic witches originates in witch hunts that left thousands dead\n\nAmerican culture made witches more cartoon-like, in films and the 1960s TV series Bewitched, but, as the academic explained, \"the image is rooted in witch hunts that cost 50,000 lives\".\n\nDressing up for Halloween parties is now as popular for adults as it has always been for children\n\nImage copyright Derry City and Strabane District Council Image caption Lily Durkan shows off a crafty costume at the Stitch a Witch workshop in Derry\n\nJoe Brolly runs the Stitch a Witch workshop in Londonderry.\n\nIn a week when it was reported that shop-bought Halloween costumes could contain the same amount of plastic as over 80m plastic bottles the event pointed to a possible alternative that learns from the past\n\n\"It encourages the reuse of old clothes and materials to make Halloween costumes and passing on old skills,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Mirrorpix/Getty Image caption Witches' hats and turnip lanterns - children celebrate Halloween in the pre-pumpkin era\n\nDerry was once a city based on the shirtmaking industry but the old skills of stitching and crafting are dying out.\n\n\"It's getting it back to the old ways of of making your own costume,\" Mr Brolly said.\n\nResearch from the charities Hubbub and the Fairyland Trust looked at over 300 clothing lines sold by 19 different retailers.\n\nThey concluded that 83% of the material found in costumes on sale contain oil-based plastic like polyester.\n\nOther research by Hubbub has estimated that 33m people dressed up for Halloween in 2017.\n\nImage caption Londonderry's Halloween festival is said to be the biggest in Europe\n\nDerry's Halloween Festival is said to be the biggest in Europe. There are dozens of events from scary pizza-making to a fancy dress dog walk and Japanese ghost stories.\n\nIt culminates in a carnival parade on Halloween night that epitomises the current state of the festival's dressing-up culture as a piece of unthreatening \"ghoulish\" fun.\n\nLast year, the council said that 100,000 people visited the city as the city's walls came alive with skeletons, nuns, witches, fire and music.\n\nImage caption A Day of the Dead routine on Strictly Come Dancing. The BBC1 programme's Halloween edition has become a fixture on the autumn TV schedule\n\nIn recent years, the colourful costumes and distinctive skull makeup associated with the Mexican Day of the Dead have proved irresistible to Halloween revellers seeking a scary look.\n\nThe festival is held at a similar time to Halloween but has different roots and meaning. It has its origins prior to Spanish colonisation and is a celebration of the lives of family and friends who have died.\n\nHowever, people wearing Day of the Dead costumes have been accused of cultural appropriation - the inappropriate adoption of one culture's customs by another.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption People wearing killer clown masks caused a public nuisance in many towns across the UK in 2016\n\nIn the autumn of 2016, a \"Killer Clown\" craze spread across the United States and the UK. People dressed in horror clown masks were seen lurking in public spaces or even chasing people down the street with plastic axes or machetes.\n\nPolice across England were called to dozens of clown incidents. In the weeks running up to Halloween, Thames Valley Police said it was called to 14 threatening Killer Clown incidents in 24 hours.\n\nEvil, eerie clowns entered popular culture through the likes of Pennywise, a character in the 1990 TV series \"IT\", before their adoption by Halloween partygoers.\n\nFancy dress\n\nPeter Irvine is unimpressed by conventional Halloween costumes. For him \"dressing up\" goes far beyond the realms of witches's hats or Hollywood films.\n\nHis interest in dressing up for Halloween goes back to his childhood when his artistic-minded mother would run up costumes for him on her sewing machine.\n\nImage copyright Peter Irvine Image caption A hairy selfie - Peter Irvine's mother used to run him off a costume on her sewing machine\n\nPeter studied Art and Design at the University of Ulster. \"As a student we'd have a fancy dress party once a month,\" he said.\n\n\"Every year I want to be dark and make people unnerved - to be something that can't be quite explained or understood,\" he says.\n\nPeter's art relies on his remarkable talent for makeup and his designs are partly inspired by the Halloween costumes of the past.\n\nIf you want to see his outlandish costume for Halloween 2019 you'll just have to wait - for the moment it's strictly under wraps.", "description": "Dressing for the scariest night of the year once meant sticking a bag on your head - now it's a multi-million pound industry", "authors": ["Robin Sheeran", "Bbc News Ni"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/138C/production/_109340050_gettyimages-3336021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
