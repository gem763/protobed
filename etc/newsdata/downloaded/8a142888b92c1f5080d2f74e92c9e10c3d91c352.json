And he was salty.\n\niCYMI: Talk to me when when he has 33% of my Super Bowl Titles https://t.co/Ba8kjPRnDs \u2014 Troy Aikman (@TroyAikman) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cTalk to me when he has 33% of my Super Bowl Titles,\u201d Aikman wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nOK, then. Play the ever-present rings card that\u2019s familiar to anybody who\u2019s ever engaged in a sports debate involving Eli Manning, LeBron James or Michael Jordan.\n\nAikman is not mad at Mahomes\n\nJust to clarify that he wasn\u2019t taking a shot at Mahomes \u2014 a beef could certainly raise a conflict for any Chiefs games Aikman calls in his duties as a Fox announcer. Aikman told USA Today on Tuesday that his issue was with the writer of the tweet, not the Kansas City quarterback.\n\n\u201cI love Mahomes,\u201d Aikman told USA Today. \u201cMy tweet was directed at the writer.\u201d\n\nA gold jacket and fistful of rings doesn't make Troy Aikman immune from the bait of a Twitter feud. (Getty)\n\nA ridiculous comparison\n\nThe entire debate is silly, of course. There\u2019s no organic basis for comparing the two a la the NBA\u2019s never-ceasing GOAT debate comparing LeBron and MJ.\n\nThe Athletic Kansas City just decided to prop up a common statistical punching bag to compare with Mahomes.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Aikman\u2019s numbers pale in comparison modern-day NFL quarterbacks.\n\nHe threw for 165 touchdowns and 141 interceptions while averaging 199.6 yards per game over the course of his 12-year career. He eclipsed the 20-touchdown threshold just once in his career. Those certainly don\u2019t look like Hall of Fame numbers, especially when propped up next to Mahomes, who threw 50 touchdowns in his first year as an NFL starter.\n\nThe case against John Elway\n\nBut of course, neither do the numbers of any of Aikman\u2019s contemporaries. NFL football in the 80s and 90s was a completely different game from the high-octane passing attacks today aided by rules that limit pass defenses and helmed by superior athletes who are products of the natural evolution of the game.\n\nJohn Elway \u2014 considered by some to be the greatest quarterback of all time \u2014 also pales in comparison to Mahomes statistically.\n\nElway threw for 300 touchdowns and 226 interceptions while averaging 220 passing yards over 234 career games. His career completion percentage was 56.9.\n\nThat\u2019s not a typo. Elway completed less than 60 percent of his career passes \u2014 a rate that would get him benched in today\u2019s NFL. His touchdown average of 1.28 per game doesn\u2019t stand up to Eli Manning (1.56 per game), much less Mahomes.\n\nThe NFL has never seen the likes of Patrick Mahomes. (Getty)\n\nSo why is this a thing?\n\nMahomes averages 328 yards and three touchdowns per game, with a better than 4-to-1 touchdown-to-interception ratio while completing 66.8 percent of his passes. The league has never seen anything like him.\n\nIt\u2019s folly to compare his numbers to Aikman\u2019s. Nobody\u2019s doubting Mahomes\u2019 greatness. Barring something tragic stunting his career, he\u2019s on pace to be a surefire first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nIf somebody wants to argue the merits of Aikman\u2019s Hall credentials, then that\u2019s fine and completely unrelated. He punched his ticket to Canton via his ring count, a case that\u2019s being made now for Eli Manning.\n\nWhat any of that has to do with Mahomes is unclear.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "A gold jacket and fistful of rings doesn't make Troy Aikman immune from the bait of a Twitter feud.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tdRxmClcAEFj1jUUxYyzHg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kWRLV6mYS4Q4nPYnj1waeA--~B/aD0yODc1O3c9NDMxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-01/df92e0f0-0fd0-11e9-91fb-30b492db0efe", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
