A PC version has also been announced, but only for next year.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Death Stranding coming to PC summer 2020 from 505 Games\n\nMORE: Hideo Kojima owes Death Stranding success to his bank manager being a fan\n\nMORE: Death Stranding Bridge Baby speaks through PS4 controller\u2019s speaker reveals Hideo Kojima", "description": "If you want to go into Hideo Kojima\u2019s new game completely spoiler free you may want to skip the launch trailer for Death Stranding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pri_67421067_1572455665.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
