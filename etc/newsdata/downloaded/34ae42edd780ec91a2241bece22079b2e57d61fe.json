It also has specific uses for the enterprise.

However it protects participants against double-spends, an attack where someone could spend the same asset twice, as does the validating notary.\"\n\nIn a white paper, ING argued the trade-off must be addressed as both concerns may have significant impacts on Corda participants.\n\nING claims its notary addresses both the privacy and security issue.\n\nThe proof of concept is the fourth undertaken by ING's DLT team, with the zero knowledge range proof, launched in 2017, allowing a blockchain network to validate that a secret number is within known limits without disclosing it.\n\nUsing a mortgage application as an example, ING said that an applicant could prove their salary sat within a certain range without revealing the exact figure.\n\nSee also: Blockchain: Why the revolution is still a decade away\n\nThe second proof of concept saw the addition of zero knowledge set memberships, which allowed for other types of information such as locations and names, rather than just numerical data to be validated.\n\nThe example ING used for the zero knowledge set memberships was that a bank could validate a new client lives in a country belonging to the European Union, without revealing the country.\n\nThe third release, called Bulletproofs, was touted by ING as being faster than the earlier zero knowledge proofs and did not require a trusted setup.\n\nAlso this week, Singaporean telco Softbank, alongside IBM and blockchain firm TBCASoft, announced they were working together to enable carriers to leverage blockchain technology through the Carrier Blockchain Study Group (CBSG) Consortium.\n\nTBCASoft has created a cross-carrier blockchain network designed to support industry-specific use cases, such as cross-border payments, digital identity, and telecom supply chain.\n\nThe first application to be launched by the CBSG Consortium is the Cross-Carrier Payment System, which will allow travelling mobile subscribers to use their mobile payment app with local merchants while abroad.\n\nMORE BLOCKCHAIN PROJECTS", "description": "ING said its zero knowledge proof notary service evaluates the validity of a transaction without revealing anything else about it.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/19/4b4cd66e-7b64-4165-a513-7c902c3c895d/thumbnail/770x578/75a8ff419d37720643357a6c8f6f5be0/global-connected-technology.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
