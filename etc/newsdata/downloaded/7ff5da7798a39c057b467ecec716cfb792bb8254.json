Canada bombed one try in the first half, had another disallowed in the second half for a forward deflection, and finally scored while Italy led 36-0.\n\n\u201cWe had a review meeting yesterday that highlighted the amount of opportunities we had,\u201d scrumhalf Gordon McRorie said on Sunday. \u201cThe fact we didn\u2019t finish them is hugely disappointing.\n\n\u201cBut having seen those opportunities we created, it was a big positive for us, so the guys are excited now to keep to the script. Going forward, just tidying up on our finishing skills and making sure that we\u2019re able to create those opportunities again \u2026 hopefully this time we\u2019ll nail them down and get some points on the board.\n\nThe Italy result underlines Canada\u2019s prospects of a thrashing from top-ranked New Zealand. But McRorie said they were looking forward to meeting the All Blacks for the first time in eight years, since the 2011 World Cup.\n\n\u201cPlaying against the best team in the world is a great opportunity for us to really challenge ourselves and a big result for us would be if we can improve on our performance from Italy,\u201d McRorie added.\n\n\u201cYou have just got to acknowledge who you\u2019re playing against, and then after that concentrate on yourself, on your own performance, on the team performance. We could revere and preview New Zealand all we like, but at the end of the day it\u2019s us that have to go on the field and represent Canada so it\u2019s what we can do in that jersey that counts.\u201d\n\nCanada has also welcomed center Guiseppe du Toit and fullback Theo Sauder as replacements in the squad for Ben LeSage and Nick Blevins.\n\nLe Sage and Blevins suffered tournament-ending injuries against Italy; LeSage needs surgery on a hand and Blevins received a broken jaw.\n\n\u201cYou never want to see your friends get hurt,\u201d Sauder said, \u201cbut we\u2019re here and ready to help when we can.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Playing much better than it did against Italy is Canada's foremost goal heading toward the Rugby World Cup game against defending champion New Zealand on Wednesday in Oita.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
