Teachers Just Went on Strike to Help Them.", "language": "en", "text": "Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nOne student in the Chicago school where Marcella Cadena teaches lives in a homeless shelter that only lets people in or out every hour, on the hour. And sometimes, the child can't make it out in time \u2014 and misses class.\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019re coming to school late and missing 30 minutes of instruction if they don\u2019t make it out by 7 a.m. because they don\u2019t have control over where they\u2019re living,\u201d said 4th-grade teacher Cadena, one of the 25,000 teachers in the Chicago Public Schools who went on strike Thursday.\n\nThe striking teachers in Chicago are making an unusual demand: that the country\u2019s third-largest district do more for students who don\u2019t have a stable roof over their heads. In addition to the standard asks of better pay and smaller class sizes, teachers want the school system to provide resources, including dedicated counselors and funding, to help both students and teachers grappling with a lack of affordable housing. Of the 300,000 students in Chicago\u2019s public schools, an estimated 16,450 are homeless. And that\u2019s based on students self-reporting, so it\u2019s likely a low count.\n\nWithout a stable home, students have serious trouble succeeding in class, according to teachers and homeless advocates in the city. They often can\u2019t focus, can\u2019t do their homework or study, and sometimes miss class altogether. And teachers told VICE News they wind up doing work outside of what\u2019s typically expected, like making calls to shelters to ensure their students have a place to go after school.\n\n\u201cI have kids who are experiencing homelessness, and they end up not coming to school because they fall through the cracks,\u201d Aaron Bingea, a 7th- and 8th-grade math teacher, told VICE News. \u201cTruancy becomes a big problem.\u201d\n\nWhen one student in Chicago showed up to class without her homework, she hadn\u2019t forgotten to do it. She tried. But she didn\u2019t have keys to her friend\u2019s apartment, where she was staying while her own family searched for something they could afford. And no one was at her friend\u2019s place to let her in.\n\n\u201cThey were always unsure night to night whether they would have housing, and they talked about how difficult it was to just study when you had no space that was your own,\u201d Doug Schenkelberg, the executive director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, told VICE News.\n\nThe Chicago Teachers Union marches outside CPS headquarters. (Victor Hilitski/Chicago Sun-Times via AP)\n\nEven students who aren\u2019t homeless struggle with affordable housing. Bingea estimated that between 80% and 90% of the students he works with have to travel over an hour to school. Their families have been priced out of their neighborhoods but want to stay in their schools. His school district has lost some 4,000 students \u2014 about a tenth of the district \u2014 in the last seven years, he said.\n\nThe average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the Chicago area is about $1,200 per month, which, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, means a household would need to make about $48,000 a year to afford a place to live. In 2017, the median household income as just above that, at $52,000.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really exciting about what the teachers are doing in Chicago is really putting it [affordable housing] in the contract demands, front and center,\u201d said Marilyn Sneiderman, director of Center for Innovation in Worker Organization at Rutgers University. \u201cHistorically, unions have actually set up affordable housing. They\u2019ve been involved with advocating legislatively for good housing laws.\u201d\n\n\"They end up not coming to school because they fall through the cracks.\"\n\nThe teachers on strike want more nurses and counselors, which some schools don\u2019t have at all, as well as higher wages for school aides and protections for undocumented students. In addition to resources for those within Chicago Public Schools, the union also wants the school system to advocate for better housing policy citywide. It\u2019s part of a growing trend in the labor movement toward bargaining over issues that extend outside of the workplace.\n\nAnd even if they lose on affordable housing, putting their demands in the contract, the teachers hope, will force the city to address the issue in other ways.\n\n\u201cI don't know of another entity in Chicago politics with as much power as we have that is actually pushing for these things,\u201d Bingea said. \u201cSo it's our responsibility to do so.\u201d\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has said that affordable housing doesn\u2019t belong in teachers\u2019 union contracts. On Thursday, she cancelled classes for all of Chicago\u2019s public school students before the teachers officially declared their strike.\n\n\u201cWe value the workers,\u201d Lightfoot said in a press conference. \u201cHonoring that value is who I am and what I stand for. But I also must be responsible for the taxpayers who pay for everything that goes on.\u201d\n\nBut others in Chicago\u2019s city government fully support the teachers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a product of Chicago Public Schools. I went to four different public schools because we were gentrified out because we didn\u2019t have affordable housing,\u201d said Chicago Alderman Andre Vazquez, who walked the picket line Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m 40 years old. At some point, things need to move forward, and we need to solve these problems.\u201d\n\nCover image: Illinois Federation of Teachers President Daniel Montgomery speaks as Chicago Public Schools teachers picket Thursday morning, Oct. 17, 2019, at Lane Tech High School in Chicago.
