But Assembly insiders confirmed the letter had also been sent to the PM\u2019s constituency office which had acknowledged receipt.\n\nMs Arcuri refused seven times in her interview to deny a sexual relationship with the then Mayor, but made clear the pair were close. Asked whether she loved him, she replied: \u201cI\u2019ve been asked that many times. I care about him deeply as a friend and we do share a very close bond.\u201d\n\nUnder the GLA code of conduct, Mr Johnson had a duty to declare any interest of family or friends so the exact nature of the relationship is seemingly irrelevant.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: \u201cRegardless of the exact nature of his relationship with Arcuri, it is clear that she and Boris Johnson were close, and that he misled the public when he said \u2018there was no interest to declare\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister is unfit for office. This morning has thrown up even more questions for Boris Johnson, which can only be answered with a full investigation into the apparent misuse of public funds.\u201d\n\nLabour MP David Lammy added: \u201cDon\u2019t be distracted. The Arcuri story is not about whether Boris Johnson is guilty of cheating on his wife. It\u2019s about whether he\u2019s guilty of criminal misconduct in public office.\u201d\n\nFour separate investigations have been launched into Mr Johnson\u2019s links with Ms Arcuri after it emerged her firm received public money from a City Hall-run organisation and that he over-ruled officials to allow her on a trade mission she was not eligible for.\n\nBoth Johnson and Arcuri deny any wrongdoing.", "description": "The London Assembly inquiry has demanded the PM hand over documents - and the consequences could be dramatic if he fails to", "authors": ["Pippa Crerar", "Image", "Getty Images", "Itv", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529773.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Prime-Minister-Boris-Johnson-Visits-A-Hospital.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
