First he was accused of violating ethics rules when he tried to pressure his former justice minister and attorney general to drop criminal charges against a Quebec-based company. Then a series of embarrassing photos emerged of him in blackface at parties in his younger years.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he\u2019s always wearing a mask,\u201d said Mr Scheer.", "description": "Justin Trudeau has been accused of betraying Canadian voters, in a leadership debate in which he was mocked by his five rivals for being untrustworthy and superficial.", "authors": ["Harriet Alexander", "William Hague", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212366705-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
