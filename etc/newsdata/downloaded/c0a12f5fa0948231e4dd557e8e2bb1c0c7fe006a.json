They opened up, we had to fly over certain Russian areas, Russian-held areas,\u201d the president said. \u201cIraq was excellent. We really had great cooperation. And you have to understand, they didn\u2019t know what we were doing and where we were going exactly. But the ISIS fighters are hated as much by Russia and some of these other countries as they are by us.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also said Turkey was \u201cterrific\u201d in its assistance, and that U.S. forces flew over Turkish-held territory en route to al-Baghdadi\u2019s compound in the Idlib province in northwestern Syria.\n\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Mr. Trump said, also contributed valuable information.\n\n\u201cThey gave us no military role at all but they gave us some information that turned out to be helpful, the Kurds,\u201d the president said.\n\nIn a post on Twitter, SDF commander Gen. Mazloum Abdi said a \u201cjoint operation\u201d resulted in the death of Baghdadi, and that the U.S. and SDF had been jointly tracking him for months.\n\n\u201cFor five months there has been joint intel cooperation on the ground and accurate monitoring, until we achieved a joint operation to kill Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks to everybody who participate in this great mission.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has faced withering criticism for his decision earlier this month to withdraw most U.S. forces from Syria as Turkey launched a military assault against SDF forces.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
