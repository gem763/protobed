NASA has contracted with Boeing and SpaceX to ferry American astronauts to the International Space Station through what\u2019s known as the Commercial Crew Program, but the timeline for the program has repeatedly slipped, and it appears unlikely that either company will fly the first astronauts this year.\n\nDuring a question and answer session with space journalists, Musk responded to NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine\u2019s Friday tweet that said \u201cCommercial Crew is years behind schedule.\u201d Bridenstine also said the agency expects the same level of enthusiasm seen for SpaceX as on \u201cthe investments of the American taxpayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a SpaceX resource standpoint, our resources are overwhelmingly on Falcon and Dragon,\u201d Musk said. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, it was really quite a small percentage of SpaceX that did Starship.\u201d\n\nSpaceX is valued at $34bn, according to an analysis by EquityZen, a marketplace for shares in pre-IPO technology companies. Musk founded the Hawthorne, California-based company in 2002. Though he is more widely known for being the CEO of electric car maker Tesla, space travel has long been his passion.\n\nSpaceX is building Starship vehicles in both Boca Chica and Cape Canaveral, Florida. Musk said that SpaceX teams are competing internally, and the first crewed mission could leave from Boca Chica. SpaceX is hoping to acquire residential properties in the hamlet of Boca Chica Village and has sent buyout offers to households.", "description": "Elon Musk has given space fans an outline of plans for ''Starship,\u201d the next-generation vehicle his Space Exploration Technologies Corp expects to use to eventually take humans to Mars.", "authors": ["Dana Hull"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8239/d8be8b6e89194553b25ef90ee284f7c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
