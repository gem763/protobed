The deal is valid on its Premium cabin, meaning you'll get to enjoy extra perks such as fast-track security, priority boarding, extra legroom, an in-flight meal and baggage allowance of two checked bags weighing up to 20kg each.\n\nPrices start from \u00a3421.80pp for flights to Rio de Janeiro and from \u00a3481.30pp for Buenos Aires.\n\nNot sure which of the two cities you'd want to visit first? You may want to check out our Rio de Janeiro guide and our Buenos Aires guide with top tips on the best things to visit, for a dose of inspiration.\n\nThe deals are already live on the Norwegian website but you'll need to be quick as the flash sale ends at 11.59pm on Wednesday 23rd October.\n\n(Image: Mikel/Flickr)\n\nTo claim the offer you'll need to use the code UKSOUTHAMERICA1943 at checkout to apply the discount.\n\nThere's quite a generous window of travel dates on offer too, with the deals valid on flights between the 1st November 2019 through to the 28th March 2020 (perfect timing if you're looking for a bit of winter sun!).\n\nBut the discounted flights are not the only deals up for grabs.\n\n(Image: iStockphoto)\n\nNorwegian is also offering up to 15 per cent off holiday packages to Rio de Janeiro, for the same travel dates.\n\nYou can book the offer on the Norwegian Holidays website using the code RIOSALE but, like the flights sale, you'll need to do so by 11.59pm on Wednesday 23rd October.\n\nLooking for more travel bargains?
