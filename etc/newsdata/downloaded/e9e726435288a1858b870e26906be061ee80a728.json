Mayor and Queloz announced the first discovery of a planet outside our own solar system, a so-called \"exoplanet,\" in 1995. Since their discovery, more than 4,000 exoplanets have been found in the Milky Way, many of them nothing like our own world. Indeed, the first planet they found, 51 Pegasi b, orbits a sun 50 light years away that heats its surface to more than 1,000 degrees centigrade, the award-giving academy said. With numerous ongoing searches for more exoplanets, this science might eventually also \"find an answer to the eternal question of whether other life is out there,\" it said.
