(John Ernst/Flickr)\n\nIt has been awhile since we\u2019ve had a good soaking rain like we saw today. Most spots picked up over an inch, and Washington was close to a daily record with 1.35 inches. While it\u2019s not my favorite kind of weather, I was willing to give this one a pass. What some might call even less friendly weather is on the way, as a chilly wind picks up tonight and keeps on going tomorrow. At least the sun returns!\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Rain is off to the northeast, save for a couple of showers, and the main story into the night is wind. Skies are trending clearer as winds pick up out of the northwest, around 20 to 25 mph, through the evening. They may diminish a bit later, but they will continue. Some gusts past 30 or 35 mph seem likely. Winds decrease somewhat in the predawn hours, but not for long.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday): Despite a lot of sun, it will feel as if we jumped ahead a few weeks on the calendar. Winds will crank back up once the sun rises, and it will stay gusty through the day. We\u2019re talking sustained winds around 20 to 30 mph, plus gusts as high as 40 or 45 mph. There\u2019s a wind advisory up for the Blue Ridge, and that could ultimately be extended to other areas. High temperatures will be mainly in the mid-50s to near 60.\n\nSee Dan Stillman\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

Some spots in West Virginia\u2019s highlands may see their first accumulating snow tonight into early tomorrow. It won\u2019t be a lot, but it\u2019s another sign of the season. This snow potential is pretty normal, with average first accumulation (0.1 inches or greater) coming around Oct. 5-10 in the region. Up at Snowshoe, it\u2019s already 35 degrees late this afternoon.
