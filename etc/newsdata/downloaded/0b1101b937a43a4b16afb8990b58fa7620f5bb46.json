And spearheading the campaign of behind-the-scenes impairment was White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nA need for a deal had been necessitated by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end DACA over the course of six months. But in the weeks after that decision was made, the president, along with Schumer and Pelosi agreed to a framework to protect DACA recipients in exchange for enhanced border security measures that notably did not include funding a border wall, Miller got to work.\n\nMiller, a staunch immigration hawk, was conspicuously left out of the bipartisan dinner meeting where that DACA framework had been formed. By the morning after the dinner, Miller, sources say, was already in discussions with Capitol Hill offices about how to ensure conservative policy gains ended up in the final deal his boss might cut.\n\nA hard-lined anti-immigration advocate, Miller strategized with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) about a more specific, more conservative, set of extractions the White House would demand in the deal. Cotton was the natural choice\u2014he is one of the Senate\u2019s most conservative members on the immigration issue, and the co-author of legislation, dubbed the RAISE Act, to significantly limit the number of legal immigrants to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been in close and constant contact on DACA and RAISE,\u201d a source familiar with their discussions told The Daily Beast. Policies in line with Cotton\u2019s legislation formed a key portion of the legislative \u201cprinciples\u201d released by the White House on Sunday.\n\nDiscussions between Cotton and Miller continued after last month\u2019s meeting, the source said. According to Caroline Rabbit, Cotton\u2019s spokeswoman, the senator \u201cwas and is in contact with numerous people in the administration about immigration policy.\u201d She described the discussions as broader than the Miller backchannel. \u201cI think it\u2019s more accurate to characterize it as he extensively consulted with the [White House] on immigration as a whole over the last few several months,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen asked about these talks several weeks ago, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed their significance. \u201cThe administration is working on a reform plan and relevant staff are engaging the hill,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cSeparately the President mentioned Cotton and Perdue in his DACA statement in terms of reform priorities so there isn\u2019t really any news here.\u201d\n\nOn the Hill, however, Democrats were acutely aware of Miller\u2019s presence and thought of it as an ominous sign. They just didn\u2019t think that Miller had rank over the other Trump White House official with whom they were speaking. As one Democratic aide told The Daily Beast, both Schumer and Pelosi had been in touch with chief of staff John Kelly several times since the DACA-deal dinner. \u201cSchumer also spoke to the president about it once urging him to move forward with the negotiations,\u201d the aide said.\n\nThat Miller operated largely out of view was by design. Multiple sources in the Trump White House tell The Daily Beast that he is acutely aware of how other senior Trump aides\u2014including former chief strategist Steve Bannon, another immigration hardliner\u2014have been banished to the doghouse by President Trump for assuming too large a public profile.\n\nMiller worries about being portrayed as the true master of Trump\u2019s immigration policy\u2014a \u201cPresident Miller\u201d capable of vetoing any \u201cdeal\u201d the actual president might strike with Democratic leaders\u2014and has operated more carefully and less ostentatiously than someone like Bannon.\n\n\u201cHe actively fears becoming that\u2026 [and] goes to great lengths to avoid the \u2018Bannon overlord\u2019 image that killed Bannon\u201d in the Trump White House, one of Miller\u2019s West Wing colleagues told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe last thing he wants is for the president to see him as some showboat.\u201d\n\nDespite those efforts, Miller remains a fascination of the press corps (The New York Times was the latest publication to pen a lengthy profile of the aide on Monday) and a much-recognized policy force inside the White House. Top aides describe him as integral to the president\u2019s domestic policy agenda, immigration in particular.\n\n\u201cWe have this running joke that if we were going to get key man\u2019s insurance on anyone, Stephen would top the list,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, told The New York Times for that profile.\n\nMiller did not respond to a request for comment. Other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about ongoing deliberations.\n\nEven as Miller took a behind-the-scenes approach on the Hill, the White House maintained a steady dialogue with conservative members who will be key to any legislative effort to replace DACA. Leading the effort was Marc Short, the White House\u2019s director of legislative affairs, who kept in touch with Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the chair of the influential House Freedom Caucus.\n\nA House Republican source said Meadows also sat down with other senior officials pressing for a workable and passable DACA replacement. The North Carolina Republican has \u201ctalked to several senior [White House] officials [about] DACA,\u201d the Hill source said. \u201cNot one in particular, but there was desire for conservatives to put on paper what they\u2019d like to see.\u201d\n\nOver the past week, the fruits of those discussions became apparent. The administration began settling on a set of proposals to demand in exchange for giving legal protection to Dreamers. They included the RAISE Act, along with funding for a wall along the southern border and a mandate for employers\u2019 use of technology to verify workers\u2019 immigration statuses,\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House told Democratic leaders that it would send their principles to congressional leadership of both parties by Friday afternoon. They didn\u2019t come. On Sunday, Pelosi and Schumer\u2019s office were informed of it by their contacts with the Department of Homeland Security, aides said. They got a more specific rundown through press accounts and by listening in to a call with Short and other administration officials.\n\nOne top House aide called the roll out and the package itself \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even trade this for legalizing 11 million people,\u201d the aide said. \u201cThe point that was made in the dinner meeting was that the DREAM Act only covers a small portion of the 11 million [undocumented immigrants in America]. So we should be talking about a border security proposal; not interior enforcement and certainly not a wall.\u201d\n\nDACA recipients will begin to lose their tentative legal statuses on March 5, 2018.", "description": "The top White House aide wants to avoid the spotlight for fear of incurring his boss\u2019 wrath.
