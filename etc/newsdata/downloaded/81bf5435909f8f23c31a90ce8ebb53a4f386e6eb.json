Some countries include only people\u2019s primary residences in their analyses. And comparisons get further muddled by the fact that different countries have different levels of urbanization and density.\n\nBut that variance in density, in a way, is the point: Even in the absence of a uniform, universal system of measurement, America is in the top tier, globally, when it comes to the size of its citizens\u2019 living spaces. The country attained this status in the past half century or so as a result of its peculiar history, culture, and economics.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the U.S. has large houses because it has more land than other countries do. \u201cPeople intuitively often think that this is the explanation \u2026 because America is such a big country,\u201d Hirt told me. \u201cWell, this is true, but Russia is a big country. Kazakhstan is a big country. Space itself doesn\u2019t really make people do one thing or another.\u201d\n\nGovernment policies, however, do. As Hirt explains in her book Zoned in the USA: The Origins and Implications of American Land-Use Regulation, the dictates of government have for the past century effectively steered Americans toward living in detached single-family homes\u2014the formal term for a prototypical stand-alone house with a yard.\n\n\u201c[A] nation of homeowners, of people who own a real share in their own land, is unconquerable,\u201d Franklin D. Roosevelt said in 1942. Of course, it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that a nation of homeowners must own big houses, but a slew of policies\u2014from the creation of the Federal Housing Administration in 1934 to the zoning mandates of individual towns and cities\u2014fueled the growth of suburbs, and in turn the growth of the houses of which they were composed.\n\nMany houses in postwar suburbs\u2014such as those in the famous preplanned Levittowns\u2014were actually quite modest, at roughly 850 square feet, says Dolores Hayden, a former professor of architecture and American studies at Yale. But over the course of the 20th century, government policy, the invention of cheaper, mass-produced building materials, marketing by home builders, and a shift in how people regarded their houses\u2014not just as homes, but as financial assets\u2014encouraged ever larger houses.\n\nIn the realm of house sizes, Europe is a common point of comparison to the United States, because things have played out very differently in the two regions (and because comprehensive data on house sizes in other parts of the world is harder to come by). One key difference is that America\u2019s period of suburban expansion (which, it\u2019s worth noting, largely excluded whole categories of Americans) coincided with the uptake of the automobile and the development of a more connected network of highways. Being able to drive farther from a city center meant cheaper land, which meant more space and bigger houses. \u201cPartially why the Europeans really cannot yet reach\u2014if that\u2019s a good thing\u2014our levels of being spread out is because they began driving later,\u201d Hirt said.", "description": "The U.S. is in the top tier of house sizes internationally\u2014and it\u2019s not just because of McMansions.", "authors": ["Joe Pinsker"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_508508179_1-1/facebook.jpg?1568309530"}
