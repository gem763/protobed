Initial reports, including a statement by a spokesman for the Houthi rebels who took responsibility for the attack, said they had used drones. Now, MarketWatch has cited unnamed sources as saying Aramco has determined the attacks involved missiles.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has already blamed the attacks on Iran, saying there was no evidence they came from Yemen. CNN quoted a Washington official as saying satellite imagery showing the strikes had come from the northwest, which suggested Iraq or Iran as the launching point.\n\nIran has denied the accusation. \"Such blind accusations and inappropriate comments in a diplomatic context are incomprehensible and meaningless,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Seyyed Abbas Mousavi said. \u201cEven hostility needs a certain degree of credibility and reasonable frameworks, US officials have also violated these basic principles.\"\n\nThe Saturday attacks caused a fire at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and a production outage at the Khurais field, taking 5.7 million bpd in daily production offline.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to have 2 million barrels a day back online\u2026by tomorrow,\u201d one of the MarketWatch sources said on Sunday. On Tuesday, Aramco will issue a progress update, chief executive Amin Nasser said.\n\nThe attack caused an unsurprising spike in oil prices, with Brent jumping close to $70 a barrel before retreating when trade started in Asia on Monday. At the time of writing, the international benchmark traded at $66.19 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate was changing hands for $59.62 a barrel at the time of writing.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "description": "Saudi energy giant Aramco said it would have a third of the oil production disrupted in the Saturday drone attacks restored by the end of the day today", "authors": ["Irina Slav"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o4sgGE1StFi7xgknERJnQQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/b5b10690-d8a2-11e9-bffb-8dc31a6d2340", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
