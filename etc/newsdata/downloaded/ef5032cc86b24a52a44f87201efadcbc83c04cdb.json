They attended elementary school together in Vancouver, Wash., lost touch, and then reconnected through social media more than a decade later. After months of chatting through the game \u201cWords with Friends,\u201d they finally went on a date in January 2013 and got engaged about a year later.\n\nKayla always knew she wanted a family, but starting her own wasn\u2019t easy. When she was 16 years old, she was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a congenital disorder that causes girls to be born either without or with an underdeveloped uterus. She stayed active in MRKH communities online, and eventually learned about a new option for women like her: uterus donation and transplantation. The first-ever birth from a transplanted uterus happened in Sweden in 2014, the year the couple married. Baylor, one of the first U.S. institutions to perform the procedure, opened its clinical trial two years later, prompting Kayla, 28, and Lance, 27, to move to Dallas.\n\nThis is the couple\u2019s story, lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

We tried for so long, and there were some days when we thought it would never happen\u2014especially being diagnosed with MRKH. To finally hold her and be like, \u2018Oh my gosh, she\u2019s here and she\u2019s ours,\u2019 has just been amazing. It\u2019s just so special and worth it.\n\nLance: The three years it took to get to where we are now felt like it was such a long journey, but everything was totally worth it. I\u2019m just soaking in every minute that I can. It\u2019s like an out-of-body experience, to be honest.\n\nTIME: What was the process like, from transplantation to birth?\n\nKayla: It\u2019s definitely been a long process\u2014a little longer than some of the other girls in the program, just because we\u2019ve had some hiccups. We moved in 2016, which is when were accepted into the trial. We had sold our house. We left everything we knew; we didn\u2019t know anybody in Texas. Then when we got here, my donor actually fell through. I was a difficult blood match, so for the next year we waited to be matched again. That was really hard, to just sit here in Dallas be like, \u2018Is this going to happen? Did we make the right choice?\u2019\n\nI was finally transplanted with a different donor\u2019s uterus in 2017, and about three months after surgery, [the] doctors decided to do an embryo transfer. It didn\u2019t work. They did another embryo transfer, and it didn\u2019t work again. We did an IVF cycle and we got no eggs; my body didn\u2019t respond to the medication. We had to go through another IVF cycle, and we only got two embryos. Then we did another embryo transfer, and it didn\u2019t work. On the fourth transfer, our last embryo, they tried a natural cycle, which means they go off my natural menstrual cycle instead of mimicking it with medicine. It worked\u2014which was really cool for a transplanted uterus, that it synched up to my body so well. My body knows what to do. I couldn\u2019t believe when they told me that I was pregnant. It was surreal.\n\nLance: I was getting to the point where I was like, \u2018You know, maybe this isn\u2019t the right thing for us to do,\u2019 between the delays and the surgery and all the failed IVF cycles and watching my wife deal with the medications and hospital visits. Getting that phone call, it\u2019s just like, \u2018What? Are you kidding me? Did they triple check?\u2019 Then it\u2019s the worry of, \u2018Is the pregnancy going to go well? Are we going to have a miscarriage?\u2019 It\u2019s a constant worry, almost from day one to the birth. But once you hold that baby and hear that cry, all of that goes out the window.\n\nTIME: Was it strange to know your uterus came from a donor?\n\nKayla: Really, it\u2019s been functioning so okay for me that I haven\u2019t really thought of it as someone else\u2019s. It\u2019s just in there! You don\u2019t really feel like, \u2018Oh, I have a uterus today.\u2019 Really, I\u2019ve just been thankful for my donor. I really haven\u2019t felt different, like there\u2019s something foreign in me. This is what my body was intended to do, and I\u2019m so thankful for this opportunity.\n\nTIME: Have you met your donor?\n\nKayla: We have written letters to each other back and forth. She gave me a children\u2019s book on the day Indy was born and wrote a sweet note in it. It made me cry.\n\nLance: I hope we can all meet the donor someday. We\u2019re all so thankful. You can\u2019t measure the amount of love that she has shown toward us, and the compassion. One day I just want to give her a big hug and tell her \u2018thank you\u2019 from the bottom of my heart.\n\nTIME: How will you share this with Indy someday?\n\nLance: Definitely a lot of scrapbooks, a lot of news articles, videos and just showing our love.\n\nTIME: Why did you choose to be so open with your story, when many couples who go through this experience are not?\n\nKayla: I\u2019ve been open since the day we left Vancouver. I just hope our story gives people inspiration and hope. It is a taboo subject, and I want people to know there\u2019s tons of support out there and people going through things with them. That has always has empowered me to share my story\u2014so it could help somebody else.\n\nWrite to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com.", "description": "Kayla and Lance Edwards this month had daughter Indy, who is the fourth baby born from a uterus transplant program at Baylor.", "authors": ["Jamie Ducharme"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kayla-lance-edwards.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
