They wrote that Trump should not have asked Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and that \u201cthere\u2019s no way to spin this as a good idea.\u201d\n\nCarlson has yet to repeat that criticism on his Fox show. Like he did in the column, he has opposed impeachment. The big story at rival news networks Tuesday was the administration\u2019s letter to the House saying it would not cooperate with the inquiry, but Carlson played it in the last half of his show, when he interviewed Republican U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes.\n\nIngraham was the only one of the three anchors to lead her broadcast with the story and said the White House counsel had made a strong argument.\n\n\u201cThis non-impeachment impeachment is not a constitutional undertaking,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political hit job, exactly what our founders did not want for our Republic.\u201d\n\nShe brought Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani and commentator Joseph diGenova on to criticize the impeachment effort. DiGenova called whistleblowers who have exposed Trump\u2019s behavior \u201csuicide bombers that the Democrats unleashed on the democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean political suicide bombers, before we start getting messages,\u201d Ingraham cautioned, apparently worried the remark was too inflammatory.\n\nBut she quickly added that people should \u201cget inside the humor\u201d of what he said.\n\nHannity\u2019s top-rated show is an often-breathless account of alleged nefarious activities by Trump\u2019s opponents, in a type of verbal shorthand with some references familiar only to his regular viewers. Trump, he said, is the victim of several \u201ccoup attempts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went from one fishing expedition to another fishing expedition,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia \u2014 that coup attempt. Then it was the tax return coup attempt. Then it was the Stormy Stormy coup attempt. Now it is the Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine coup attempt. That\u2019s all this is. They could not accept the will of the people \u2014 insane, obsessive, compulsive, psychotic witch hunts rooted in rage and a lack of connection to the reality that they lost.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance on Hannity\u2019s show earlier this month, Geraldo Rivera suggested his host was keeping Trump afloat and referenced an era when there was no Fox News Channel.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your show, Sean, they would destroy him absolutely,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cYou\u2019re the difference between Donald Trump and Richard Nixon.\u201d\n\nHannity\u2019s show reached an average of 3.28 million people each weeknight in July, August and September, according to Nielsen Media Research. Carlson averaged 3.08 million viewers and Ingraham had 2.63 million.\n\nFox has received attention recently for other personalities who have given Trump a hard time: veteran journalist and Sunday host Chris Wallace, daytime host Shepard Smith and, increasingly, commentator Andrew Napolitano. Yet Napolitano doesn\u2019t have a regular show on the network and while Smith leads other cable networks in the ratings, his audience is roughly a third of Hannity\u2019s since fewer people watch TV during the day.\n\nThe Pew Research Center, in a 2017 survey, found that 40% of Trump voters listed Fox News Channel as its main source of election news. No other media outlet reached even one-quarter of that level.\n\nThe prime-time lineup, along with the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d morning show, is where Fox\u2019s influence is the greatest.\n\nLike Trump, the three prime-time anchors showed Tuesday that they like to attach nicknames to perceived opponents. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is a \u201cprevaricating, priggish partisan,\u201d Ingraham said. Hannity called Biden \u201csleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe.\u201d\n\nAll three shows highlighted a tweet by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling for a discussion of incarceration policies, with Hannity calling her his \u201cvillain of the day.\u201d\n\nCarlson\u2019s show spotlighted opponents to Trump\u2019s call for withdrawing troops from Syria, neglecting to include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who made his criticism on Fox\u2019s airwaves.\n\nViewers can even follow the shows with the volume muted. Onscreen chyrons included \u201cThe Real Threat to Democracy: DC Establishment Trying to Block Prez\u2019s Plans\u201d; \u201cLeftist Media Freaks Out Over White House Letter\u201d and \u201cLife Under Dems: Free Health Care for the World.\u201d", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Critics of President Donald Trump who wonder about the tenacity of his supporters need only to spend three hours with Fox News Channel's", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/52e8b9_fox-trump-95275-combination-photo-shows-left-tucker-carlson-host-tucker-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
