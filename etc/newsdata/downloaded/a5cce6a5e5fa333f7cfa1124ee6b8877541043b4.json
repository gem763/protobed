Lord Of The Rings TV Show To Film In New Zealand", "language": "en", "text": "Amazon Studios just announced the filming location for its upcoming Lord of the Rings prequel show. And after searching far and wide it settled on... drumroll please... New Zealand!\n\nShowrunners and executive producers J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay released the following statement on the momentous decision:\n\nAs we searched for the location in which we could bring to life the primordial beauty of the Second Age of Middle-earth, we knew we needed to find somewhere majestic, with pristine coasts, forests, and mountains, that also is a home to world-class sets, studios, and highly skilled and experienced craftspeople and other staff.\n\nAnd we\u2019re happy that we are now able to officially confirm New Zealand as our home for our series based on stories from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings. We are grateful to the people and the government of New Zealand and especially Auckland for supporting us during this pre-production phase. The abundant measure of Kiwi hospitality with which they have welcomed us has already made us feel right at home, and we are looking forward to deepening our partnership in the years to come.", "description": "Amazon Studios just announced the filming location for its upcoming Lord of the Rings prequel show.
