Facebook announced the creation of the association and its plans in June, saying it had lined up partners from a variety of business fields.\n\nThe senators said companies joining the Libra Association should proceed with caution until Facebook can provide better answers about the risks the cryptocurrency could pose.\n\n\u201cFacebook is currently struggling to tackle massive issues, such as privacy violations, disinformation, election interference, discrimination and fraud, and it has not demonstrated an ability to bring those failures under control,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cYou should be concerned that any weaknesses in Facebook\u2019s risk management systems will become weaknesses in your systems that you may not be able to effectively mitigate.\u201d\n\nDante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, said that the group \u201cmaintains its commitment to not launch until questions and concerns by regulators are addressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is enshrined in our long launch runway, which has helped inform regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders around the world about our commitment to responsible financial innovation and strong oversight,\u201d Disparte said.\n\nRepresentatives from the three companies didn\u2019t immediately say whether they were rethinking their participation in the Libra Association.\n\nSome companies have reportedly had second thoughts about working with the Libra Association following scrutiny from regulators and concerns about public backlash.\n\nOn Friday, PayPal announced it was no longer participating with the group.\n\n\u201cWe remain supportive of Libra\u2019s aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future,\u201d PayPal said then in a statement to FOX Business.\n\nThe Libra Association responded to the news on Twitter, writing that each organization participating would \u201chave to make its own assessment of risks and rewards of being committed to seeing through the change that Libra promises.\u201d\n\nDisparte said more than 1,500 entities have reached out to the Libra Association about joining.\n\n\u201cOur mission of financial inclusion enjoys broad global support,\u201d Disparte said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "PayPal has backed out of the Libra Association.
