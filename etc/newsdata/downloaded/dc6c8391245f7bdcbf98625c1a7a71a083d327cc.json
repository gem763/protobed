The BRC has long been calling for many of the key recommendations.\n\n\u201cAny party that wants to support local high streets should commit to implementing the committee\u2019s reforms as a first step.\n\n\u201cBusiness rates are a significant driver of store closures and job losses and retailers have been getting a raw deal for too long.\u201d", "description": "The influential select committee has called on the Government to introduce a new system of property tax.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/31/00/wire-20403052-1572480290-18_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-31"}
