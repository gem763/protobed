For more information, see our ethics policy .\n\nWe\u2019re seeing the first big uptick in deals today since Amazon Prime Day in mid-July. Most of them are happening at Best Buy, which is having a three-day sale on Amazon products, like Kindles, Echo Dot smart speakers, and smart home tech. It also has plenty of other things discounted, like Beats headphones, the iPad Air, and more. Of course, I\u2019ve included deals that you should know about from other retailers, too.\n\nSeveral Kindle models are deeply discounted at Best Buy, notably the previous generation of the Kindle Oasis with 8GB of storage and no special offers (Amazon\u2019s ads) for $174.99 (usually $249.99), and the 32GB model, also without special offers, for $204.99 (usually $279.99). This version is mostly the same as Amazon\u2019s latest Oasis, though its display lacks adjustable color temperature.\n\nIf the Oasis costs a bit too much for you, you should check out the latest Kindle Paperwhite with 8GB of storage and special offers, which costs $84.99 (usually $129.99) at Best Buy. Its display is just as pixel-dense (300ppi) as the Oasis, and it\u2019s waterproof, too. This is my colleague Chaim Gartenberg\u2019s top pick for the best e-reader, edging out the Oasis, thanks to its lower price.\n\nDJI\u2019s Osmo Pocket gimbal with an integrated camera capable of 4K/60 frames per second capture is $324.99 at Daily Steals. Verge readers can get this price by entering the offer code VERGEDJI at checkout.\n\nThis gimbal is priced at $349.99 at Amazon and elsewhere, and according to my colleague Jon Porter, who reviewed the Osmo Pocket, it might be a nice addition to your vlogging setup. It\u2019s not perfect, but if you\u2019re looking for an all-in-one solution to record stable video, you might want to check this out.\n\nSamsung\u2019s 27-inch Space Monitor is down to $249.99 (usually $399.99). This is the biggest price drop that we\u2019ve seen yet for this QHD display, and it stands out from most other models in a few ways. Its arm attaches to the edge of a desk, and it allows the monitor to move up and down, so you can customize how close you\u2019d like to be to it and how much space you\u2019d like to reclaim on your desk. This monitor has some flaws (the same ones that Dan Seifert found in his review of the larger 32-inch 4K model): it has no USB-C ports, and you can\u2019t rotate or swivel the monitor.\n\nVizio\u2019s 65-inch M-Series 4K HDR TV is $769.99 (usually $999.99). This 2019 M-Series model features quantum dot technology (previously reserved for the high-end P-Series), which aims to give it the deep blacks and vivid colors of an OLED without the high cost. This model, and all of Vizio\u2019s other SmartCast-enabled TVs dating back to 2016, recently got Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support.", "description": "You can save some money on Amazon Kindle e-readers, Fire TV Stick 4K, and other tech at Best Buy\u2019s big three-day sale.
