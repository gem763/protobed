The Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, asked the Law Commission of India in 2015, to examine the need for a Bail Act in India. The letter attached with the 268th report of the Law Commission, headed by Justice B S Chauhan, reflects the fact that during a meeting of the Advisory Council for Justice Delivery and Law Reforms held in 2016, it was decided that there was no need of a separate and independent Bail Act. Rather, it was observed that amendments to existing laws statutes can be suggested.\n\n19. The Commission started working on the subject from March 2016. After a preliminary study, it called for a consultation in which it interacted and heard the views of Police Officers from a number of states in November 2016.
