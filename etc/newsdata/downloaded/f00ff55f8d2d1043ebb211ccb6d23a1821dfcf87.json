Once fully opened the venue will become the largest shopping \u201cmall\u201d in the U.S.\n\nAmerican Dream Mall Nickelodeon Universe More\n\nAmerican Dream goes big on entertainment\n\nAmerican Dream\u2019s three million-plus square foot combined theme park, water park, ice rink, ski hill, cinema, live performance theater, shopping and dining destination shares similar concepts with Triple Five\u2019s other marquee properties, Minneapolis metro\u2019s Mall of America and Edmonton\u2019s West Edmonton Mall, with the exception of its entertainment-to-retail ratio. While two established malls offer 20% entertainment and 80% retail, American Dream is 55% entertainment and 45% retail. American Dream\u2019s currently open entertainment options include more than 35 rides, along with multiple roller coasters, and skating rink.\n\n\u201cThe Retail Apocalypse has actually been really great for us, relative to our peers,\u201d Ghermezian said. \u201cI love Amazon. I love online shopping, but what I found from our business is it has weeded out the weaker centers and the weaker experiences, and that\u2019s allowed for centers like ours... to actually take a bigger piece of that pie and do better. What we\u2019re seeing is, at the end of the day, people are still social creatures and people want to get out.\u201d\n\nAmerican Dream Mall Nickelodeon Universe More\n\n\u2018This is a huge step and it\u2019s a long time coming\u2019\n\nThe private company secured financing for American Dream, after a prior developer abandoned the project in 2003, by leveraging a 49% stake in its Mall of America property along with the sale of $1.1 billion in tax-exempt bonds. The developers reportedly received $390 million in tax concessions.\n\n\u201cOur commitment of that in order to secure the financing in getting it done, in that we pledged our crown jewel asset is really an example of our commitment and belief in the success of this development,\u201d Ghermezian said.\n\n\u201cThis is a big day for New Jersey this is a huge step and it\u2019s a long time coming,\u201d New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said during a press conference held for the opening.\n\nWith high-end retailers and anchor department stores including Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor flanking the property\u2019s entertainment venues, American Dream\u2019s brick and mortar stores will have to impress. Over the past few years, prominent retailers have shuttered their doors and filed for bankruptcy, en masse. American Apparel, BCBG, Aerosols and Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy, to name a few. An April 2019 UBS report cited by The Washington Post predicted that 75,000 clothing, electronics and furniture stores would close within the next 6 to 7 years.\n\nAmerican Dream\u2019s new tenants will also have to compete with Bergen County\u2019s Blue Laws that prevent a majority of traditional retailers from opening for business on Sundays. The venue\u2019s amusement and theme parks will remain open 7 days per week. Though American Dream could either get a boost or a boot from its location. A nearby shopping mecca in Paramus, New Jersey, also subject to Bergen County\u2019s Blue Laws, famously drives more dollars in annual retail sales than all other zip codes in the U.S.\n\nStory continues", "description": "On October 26, eight miles west of Manhattan in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the doors swing partially open to a mega, don\u2019t-call-it-a-mall, entertainment and retail venue betting that it can sidestep the \u201cRetail Apocalypse.\u201d", "authors": ["Alexis Keenan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YUzO2ZDRDCxSsFOnGT87gA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/f6f9bc70-f7f9-11e9-9f2f-d286c4a02475", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
