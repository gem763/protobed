USA TODAY\n\nPrince Harry sued the owners of British tabloids The Sun and the Daily Mirror over alleged phone hacking.\n\nBuckingham Palace confirmed to USA TODAY that the Duke of Sussex's lawsuit was filed in Britain's High Court, regarding alleged illegal interception of voicemail messages.\n\nUSA TODAY was unable to reach The Sun or The Daily Mirror for comment before publication.\n\nThe lawsuit comes days after he announced Sunday that he and Duchess Meghan were taking legal action against Associated Newspapers, the parent company of The Mail.\n\nHarry, 35, released an emotional statement Tuesday on his official website with Duchess Meghan, rebuking the tabloid press.\n\n\"Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences \u2013 a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son,\" he wrote in the statement. \"I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\"\n\nHe continued: \"My deepest fear is history repeating itself. I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/04/prince-harry-alleged-phone-hacking-suing-british-tabloids-the-sun-daily-mirror/3866915002/", "description": "Prince Harry, who defended his wife, the former Meghan Markle, sued the owner of The Sun and The Daily Mirror over alleged phone hacking.", "authors": ["Anika Reed", "Published P.M.
