Pictured with their new replacement boiler\n\nWorse was to come, however, with a bombshell demand from the installers for \u00a325,000.\n\nThey said the couple had failed to send back paperwork that enabled the firm to claim RHI subsidies.\n\nConvinced they had done nothing wrong, Dennis and Pauline sold their cattery business for a tenth of its value to fund lawyers to fight the action.\n\nNow, a judge has not only rejected the installer's case, but also found it had mis-sold them the boiler with false claims it would reduce heating bills.\n\nPauline says: 'If we had lost, we could have had to pay them more than \u00a360,000 because they were seeking their costs in addition to their damages claim.\n\n'This would scare many people and force them to settle out of court.\n\n'But we felt so strongly about the case that we were prepared to lose our house to get justice \u2014 I couldn't let them get away with it. Someone needed to stand up against them.'\n\nThe Burton's victory is a new blow to the scheme, which a damning report by MPs last year revealed has wasted billions of pounds of taxpayers' cash.\n\nCoalition ministers \u2014 also behind the failed Green Deal environmental initiative \u2014 had expected 513,000 biomass or heat pump boilers to be installed under RHI.\n\nBut there were just 60,000 by 2018. Yet, according to the Commons public accounts committee, the scheme is expected to have cost a staggering \u00a323billion by 2041.\n\nMinisters had expected 513,000 biomass or heat pump boilers to be installed under RHI. But there were just 60,000 by 2018 and the scheme is expected to have cost \u00a323bn by 2041\n\nIn addition, it warned that burning wood was causing a 'serious public health issue' by pumping out smoke, affecting air quality.\n\nThe Burtons signed up to a deal with Yorkshire firm Wood Boilers LLP after their conventional boiler broke in 2014.\n\n'They recommended a wood pellet boiler, which they said was green and would cut bills by up to 70 per cent a year,' Pauline says. 'They were selling us a dream, but it turned out to be a nightmare.'\n\nThe boiler was installed for a nominal \u00a3100 fee, plus a \u00a310-a-month lease, under which they had to return an annual form declaring they were buying the pellets from approved suppliers.\n\nPauline, 58, says: 'At the start, we were thrilled, and the house was lovely and warm. But then the boiler started breaking down and it would cost us about \u00a340 in wood pellets just to take a bath.\n\n'I had my son and his wife to stay, and had to say she couldn't have a bath because I couldn't afford it. It was so embarrassing.'\n\nPauline says engineers told them the boiler was costing so much as it was 'strong enough to heat a nursing home' and 'far too big'.\n\nTheir nightmare began in earnest in February 2018, when a bailiff arrived, demanding \u00a325,000. Wood Boilers alleged the Burtons had breached their lease by failing to return paperwork, which allowed the firm to claim RHI payments worth \u00a333,000.\n\nIt cancelled the lease and lodged a claim for seven-and-a-half years of payments \u2014 but the Burtons did not get the form so the firm secured a High Court judgment against them.\n\nPauline says: 'To see a bailiff at our door frightened me to death.\n\n'We're just normal people trying to get on with our lives. We'd never dealt with the courts before.'\n\nAfter selling their cattery \u2014 their pride and joy \u2014 they hired law firm Nelsons to act for them.\n\nThis summer, a judge at Derby County Court threw out Wood Boilers' claim, accepting that the couple had sent back paperwork.\n\nHe also upheld the Burtons' counterclaim that the boiler was mis-sold to them on false grounds that their bills would go down.\n\nWood Boilers said the figures were 'sales puff'. The judge disagreed and let the Burtons quit the lease. The boiler was removed.\n\nPauline \u2014 who is registered deaf \u2014 says the stress of the case left her needing anxiety tablets, antidepressants and sleeping tablets. Dennis says: 'Pauline looks ten years younger now. We feared the stress was going to kill us off.'\n\nTheir solicitor, Oliver Maxwell, adds: 'If you have been sold a dream story that turned into a nightmare, seek legal advice \u2014 you could claim misrepresentation.'\n\nWood Boilers shares directors and a registered address with A Shade Greener Boilers, which was approached for comment.\n\nA Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman says the RHI scheme has helped nearly 80,000 homes to install low-carbon heating systems as part of efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nHe adds: 'We have consulted on improving air quality by restricting new installations of biomass boilers in urban areas, and will be responding to the feedback we have received in due course.'\n\nmoneymail@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "After their boiler broke down, Dennis and Pauline Burton signed up for a \u00a310-a-month 'biomass' boiler fuelled by wood pellets, believing it would save them cash and help the environment.", "authors": ["James Tozer For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
