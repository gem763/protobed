She told Hanna about the hate crime that left her with life-changing injuries after she was repeatedly run over by a 21-year-old stranger in the street.\n\nHanna's article about Costa Coffee working conditions revealed employees' complaints alleging managers' refusal to pay for sickness or annual leave, working outside of contracted hours and the retention of tips.\n\nA Costa Coffee spokeswoman said in August that an independent audit had been launched \"given the serious nature of the allegations\".\n\nLast year she also wrote about why some homeless people chose the streets over emergency shelter despite sub-zero temperatures.\n\nWearing the hijab\n\nHanna started at the BBC as a researcher on the News at Six and Ten in December 2017, before moving to the BBC News Channel and News at One and the website.\n\nBefore joining the BBC, Hanna wrote for publications including the Guardian, the Independent, the Times, the Muslim News, the Pool and Grazia Magazine.\n\nIn 2015, she created a video for the Guardian about her decision to wear the hijab at the time, saying \"it has nothing to do with oppression. It's a feminist statement\", which was picked up by other websites including Teen Vogue and Everyday Feminism.\n\nAppearing on Good Morning Britain after the European Court of Justice's 2017 ruling gave employers the power to ban all political, religious and philosophical symbols at work, she told TV presenters Piers Morgan and Susannah Reid it would \"disproportionately affect Muslim women\".\n\nBorn in Somalia in 1992, she received a Scott Trust bursary to do an MA in newspaper journalism at City, University of London in 2017, following her degree at Queen Mary, University of London.\n\nIn a statement, Hanna's family said the death of their \"beloved daughter, sister and niece\" had come as a shock and asked for privacy.\n\n\"Many will know Hanna for her incredible contributions to journalism and for her work at the BBC.\n\n\"While we mourn her loss, we hope that Hanna's legacy will serve as an inspiration and beacon to her fellow colleagues and to her community and her meaningful memory and the people she has touched for many years lives on,\" they said.\n\nThey added that they would notify the community about funeral arrangements in due course.\n\nDirector of BBC News Fran Unsworth said: \"This is terrible news that has left us all deeply saddened. Hanna Yusuf was a talented young journalist who was widely admired across the BBC and our utmost sympathies go to her family and many friends. Hanna will be much missed.\"\n\nFellow BBC journalist Sophia Smith Galer said Hanna was \"invariably the kindest, smartest and most captivating person in the room\".\n\n\"We have lost a fierce friend and a force for truth and light which stretched far beyond her journalism to the many lives she touched here at the BBC and beyond,\" she said.\n\n\"We will make sure her legacy of compassionate storytelling rings loud and clear in the time to come and we are going to miss her so, so much.\"\n\nAnd BBC chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet tweeted: \"You left too soon a world where you shone such a bright light.\"", "description": "The BBC described her as a \"talented young journalist who was widely admired\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7820/production/_109025703_hanna_yusuf_bbc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
