We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nUnlike the other candidates, who have advocated banning the further sale of assault weapons, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan involves confiscating such weapons under a forced buyback program. Government confiscation of firearms has long been a bogeyman for many gun rights advocates\u2014eliciting comparisons to Nazi Germany and other authoritarian regimes.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, in the debate, said that weapons \u201cdesigned to kill people on a battlefield\u201d must go, but that he feels both Republicans and Democrats should be included in the conversation about how to eliminate them.\n\n\u201cIf the high-impact, high-velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so you would bleed to death on a battlefield. Not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\n\u201cWhen we see that being used against children. And in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15. And that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour, because so many other people were shot by an AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren\u2019t enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell yes. We\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments appeared to immediately galvanize people on both sides of the gun debate.\n\nA Texas State Rep. Briscoe Cain responded to O\u2019Rourke on Twitter, writing, \u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Twitter account sent out a screenshot of the tweet, writing, \u201cThis is a death threat, Representative. Clearly, you shouldn\u2019t own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BetoORourke/status/1172359875093061632\n\nAt the same time, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team signaled that the debate had given O\u2019Rourke a boost. Rob Flaherty, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s digital director, tweeted shortly before the debate ended that O\u2019Rourke had the \u201cbest hour of fundraising this quarter.\u201d After another hour, he tweeted again, \u201cthis hour was better.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Rob_Flaherty/status/1172357520658247680\n\nBy most accounts, AR-15-style rifles are now are the most popular rifles in America, with some sales representing 60% of all rifles sold in the U.S. and some 15 million in civilian hands.\n\nThe National Rifle Association was quick to point this out in a tweet minutes after O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments at the debate. \u201cBanning commonly-owned rifles used lawfully by millions of Americans everyday is not the answer,\u201d the NRA tweeted.\n\nBeto: \u201cHell yes, I will ban your AR-15 and AK-47.\u201d\n\n\n\nBanning commonly-owned rifles used lawfully by millions of Americans everyday is not the answer. Thankfully, he won\u2019t be president \u2014 polling VERY low. #DemDebate #DemDebates\n\n\n\n\u2014 NRA (@NRA) September 13, 2019\n\nSuch weapons have also been used in many of the highest-profile mass shootings in recent years.\n\nO\u2019Rourke actually introduced the plan last month, writing in a USA Today op-ed that, \u201cOn this issue, Americans are more connected than we might imagine. We need to stop making assumptions and writing one another off, because only by coming together and finding common ground can we finally meet this moment, and start saving lives.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke has made strengthening gun control laws one of the central focuses of his campaign since Aug. 3, when a gunman killed 22 people in a Walmart in El Paso. He returned to the city soon after the shooting expressed his grief for the victims and to call for gun-control legislation. The gunman used an AK-47-style assault rifle, according to police.\n\nO\u2019Rourke mentioned the shooting during both his opening and closing statements during the third Democratic Debate.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s Twitter account backed up his message during the debate, sending out tweets calling for assault weapon buybacks. The account tweeted an image of an assault weapon with a grenade launcher\u2014something that\u2019s illegal for civilians to own\u2014with the phrase \u201cBeto has a ban for that\u201c\u2014a riff on Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \u201cI have a plan for that.\u201d", "description": "Beto O'Rourke advocated mandatory buybacks of AR-15s, AK-47s and other assault weapons during the third Democratic debate on Thursday.", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KRr3nmRUuAUp1lqIXlNu6A--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/9dfa5b2c49146d14c3daa17f0439f3e0", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
