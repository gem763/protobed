One D.C. lawmaker wants to change that.", "language": "en", "text": "In an emergency bill aimed at sidestepping congressional approval, Allen has asked the D.C. Council to ban city agencies from providing information to ICE agents or allowing them to enter facilities run by the D.C. Department of Corrections \u2014 unless the federal agency can produce a warrant or judicial order.\n\nAD\n\nAs the Trump administration continues its crackdown on immigrant communities with regular raids in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods and at work sites around the country and a fast-track deportation process meant to bypass immigration judges, local governments have increasingly acted to protect undocumented residents.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe say we\u2019re a sanctuary city, and we mean it in so many ways. But we should not be complicit in the Trump administration and how they treat our immigrant friends and neighbors,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI hope this is something our entire city can get around and support. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s really just about doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nWhen an individual is arrested, officers enter personal information, including fingerprints, into an FBI database at the National Crime Information Center. Based on that information, if immigration officials determine a person is in the country illegally, ICE may ask local law enforcement to detain the person until ICE agents can pick him or her up\n\nAD\n\nBut multiple courts have ruled that these ICE detainers are requests, not orders. Many cities and some states have passed laws ordering their agencies to refuse to comply.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2012, the District became one of the first municipalities in the country to limit its cooperation with ICE by vowing it wouldn\u2019t turn over arrestees to federal immigration agents unless that person was deemed violent or dangerous.\n\nD.C. agencies are legally allowed to hold individuals for a day past their scheduled date of release if certain criteria are met, including proof of prior convictions and a written agreement that the federal government would reimburse D.C. for the cost of the extra day. D.C. corrections officers may also give ICE a 48-hour warning before releasing an arrestee for whom an ICE detainer has been issued.\n\nAD\n\nAllen said the District has a responsibility to do more to protect its immigrant residents.\n\n\u201cI talked to a number of our immigrant \u2014 both documented and undocumented \u2014 neighbors,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAnd the fear they expressed and shared with me, the stories they told me \u2014 they\u2019re not feeling safe in our city.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDetention of immigrant after his arrest in D.C. points to holes in sanctuary city status\n\nInstead of requesting that law enforcement agencies hold individuals for immigration agents, ICE has changed its strategy. Agents now routinely ask for information about arrestees\u2019 release, including location, dates, times and a home address where the person is expected to return.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019, the D.C. Department of Corrections turned over 43 immigrants to immigration agents, according to a report in the Washington City Paper.\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cDOC has assisted in the detention of many more individuals after their release from DOC by notifying ICE of release dates and times,\u201d says Allen\u2019s emergency resolution. \u201cCollaborating with ICE, including by complying with detainer requests, does not promote public safety. ICE has created an unsafe, fearful environment for the District\u2019s immigrant residents. When the District cooperates with ICE, trust in District agencies by the immigrant community erodes, and public safety is compromised.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe bill also explicitly bans ICE from entering D.C. facilities, including the jail, juvenile justice facilities and St. Elizabeths Hospital.\n\nAllen\u2019s emergency measure, which will be reviewed by the D.C. Council at its Oct. 8 meeting, requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass. Co-sponsoring the bill are council members David Grosso (I-At Large), Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) and Elissa Silverman (I-At Large).\n\nAD\n\nImmigrant rights advocates are optimistic about its chances.\n\n\u201cWhat we see in our community is that they\u2019re not really living their best life. They\u2019re existing and walking with fear. They\u2019re going to school with fear,\u201d said Claudia Qui\u00f1onez, a youth organizer with immigrant rights group United We Dream. \u201cHaving this bill be introduced and possibly become law would essentially mean . . . they would no longer have to simply exist \u2014 they could thrive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLocal governments across the D.C. area are expanding legal defense funds for immigrants facing deportation\n\nThe bill\u2019s introduction comes on the heels of an announcement from the D.C. mayor\u2019s office that a legal aid fund meant to help immigrants in the District would be expanded \u2014 from $900,000 to $2.5 million \u2014 and made available to immigrants who have been detained.\n\nAD\n\nFor years, activists been calling for more robust immigrant protections from the D.C. government.\n\n\u201cThis emergency legislation is a significant step forward,\u201d said Gaurav Madan, an organizer with Sanctuary DMV. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that it will help make D.C. a safer place \u2014 not just for immigrants but for everyone.\u201d\n\nICE did not respond to a request for comment on Allen\u2019s bill. But earlier this week, Matthew Albence, the agency\u2019s acting director, lambasted sanctuary cities that refuse to help deport immigrants who are in the United States illegally.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis needs to stop,\u201d he said during a news conference at the White House. \u201cWork with us. Find a way that we can jointly prevent murderers, pedophiles, rapists, drug dealers and domestic abusers from being released back into our communities. It\u2019s plain and simple.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAllen said he was unbothered by drawing the ire of Trump administration officials.\n\nEarlier this year, the White House attempted to pressure Homeland Security officials into releasing detainees onto the streets of \u201csanctuary cities\u201d to alleviate a shortage of detention facilities and also serve to send a message to Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a president who has open destain for this city, who doesn\u2019t pay his bills to this city,\u201d Allen said, referring to a $6 million deficit incurred by the District for expenses related to the president\u2019s refashioned Fourth of July celebration this summer as well as his 2017 inauguration. \u201cWe\u2019re a target already. I don\u2019t see how this would all of a sudden be different.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVirginia\u2019s largest county could be next to help undocumented immigrants fight deportation\n\nHousing activists push for more aggressive rent-control measures in D.C.\n\nSt. Elizabeths Hospital without drinking water after legionella bacteria found\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "D.C.
