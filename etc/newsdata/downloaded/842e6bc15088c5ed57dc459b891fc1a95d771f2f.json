(AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nArkansas State coach Blake Anderson made sure to thank Georgia fans for their support after the Bulldogs beat the Red Wolves on Saturday.\n\nThousands of Georgia fans wore pink to the game to honor Anderson\u2019s late wife Wendy, who died of breast cancer on Aug. 19. Saturday was Anderson\u2019s first game back on the sidelines since he took a leave of absence from the team shortly before Wendy\u2019s death.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cOne of the classiest moves I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cHard to truly prepare for something like that. So I would say thank you to all those who showed up today wearing pink or thinking pink. They don\u2019t know my wife, they don\u2019t know me and they didn\u2019t have to do it.\u201d\n\nAnderson also tweeted this right after the game.\n\nAnderson said earlier in the week that he cried when he found out what Georgia fans were planning for Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nWhile Anderson was thrilled with what Georgia fans did to honor his wife, he wasn\u2019t thrilled with how his football team performed. Arkansas State lost 55-0 to the No. 3 Bulldogs and had fewer than 50 yards rushing.\n\n\u201cI wish the game would have gone differently,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI think we have a better team than we showed today.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Anderson's wife Wendy died on Aug. 19 after battling breast cancer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/m9RMT6HseqPFopBc5dkFzg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H_kpb2XBOrro7eApP.Ewcw--~B/aD0yMzgyO3c9NDIzNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/236475f0-d72c-11e9-90f3-b764f54728cf", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
