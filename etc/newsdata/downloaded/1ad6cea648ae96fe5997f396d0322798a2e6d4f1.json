A cold front combined with ash from forest fires in the Amazon rainforest and formed ominous clouds that blocked out the sun. Photos of the blackened sky began to pop on Twitter, and soon the world was paying attention to the blazes rampaging across the forest called \u201cthe lungs of the world.\u201d Many blame President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric as the central factor in the crisis. Less obvious are the ways the conflagration stems from years of slashing government budgets for the environment and dismantling support for indigenous and traditional subsistence communities.\n\nFor example, Bolsonaro\u2019s predecessor, Michel Temer, reorganized the government and wielded his budget scissors liberally. Temer downgraded a ministry focused on supporting sustainable family farms and chopped funds for environmental protections and science. In 2017, Temer cut the federal science budget by 44% and took nearly the same amount from the discretionary budget of IBAMA, Brazil\u2019s environmental agency. In April 2019, Bolsonaro continued the trend, cutting IBAMA\u2019s budget by 24%. Those cuts left the agency unable to cover its fixed costs and left it without resources for patrolling and enforcement.\n\nA spokesperson for IBAMA says that its budget has been reinstated to what it was prior to the April cuts. Nonetheless, thus far in 2019, IBAMA has issued only one third of the fines it did over the same period last year, according to Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, one of Brazil\u2019s largest newspapers. The drop is likely a result of both a lack of funding and political will. Earlier this year, Bolsonaro had IBAMA fire an agent, who happened to have fined Bolsonaro years ago for illegal fishing.\n\nIn a similar vein, after the Brazilian space agency, called INPE, released new satellite data showing a 278% increase in deforestation in July compared to the same period last year, Bolsonaro fired the agency\u2019s head, suggesting that the data were trumped up in order to tarnish the country\u2019s image.\n\nBrazil\u2019s strong agriculture sector has ratcheted up pressure on forests. Agriculture has been the strongest performing sector of Brazil\u2019s economy in recent years, and the US-China trade war has positioned Brazil well to replace the US as the global leader in soybean exports. The demand for soybeans has created pressure to rapidly clear forests and plant. Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s oldest son, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, a senator, has introduced a bill that would eliminate a requirement that rural properties in the Amazon maintain 80% of their native vegetation.\n\n\"No country in the world has the moral right to talk about the Amazon. You destroyed your own ecosystems.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the president has regularly challenged criticism about his government\u2019s environmental policies in a way some see as condoning deforestation. \u201cThe Amazon is ours,\u201d Bolsonaro told journalists in mid-July. \u201cWe preserve more [rainforest] than anyone. No country in the world has the moral right to talk about the Amazon. You destroyed your own ecosystems.\u201d\n\nFabiano Lopez da Silva, head of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Vitoria Amazonica, an environmental non-governmental organization based in Mana\u00fas, says such rhetoric stimulates illegal deforestation. \u201c[Farmers and illegal loggers] can go forward with illegal fires. There won\u2019t be any sort of [fiscal enforcement] or monitoring or fines for this kind of activity,\u201d says Lopez da Silva.\n\nThere are indications that these latest fires may have at least in part been the result of political acts. According to the Folha do Progresso, a publication from the southern part of the Amazonian state of Par\u00e1, farmers and ranchers in the region organized what they called \u201ca day of fire\u201d for Aug. 10, where they would set forests aflame to clear land for pasture and planting. Their goal, according to the outlet, was to show Bolsonaro they wanted to work, and burning down trees was the way to do that. In the following 48 hours, forest fires spread rapidly in the region. The New York Times reports that farmers set the bulk of these fires, but that they targeted land already cleared for agriculture, not old-growth forest.\n\nSimilarly, the environment secretary for the state of Amazonas, Eduardo Taveira, told TIME that in the southern part of the state, the agency has seen an unusually large number of fires in areas where man-made forest fires are an annual issue. Taveira and Lopez da Silva both noted that forest fires in the Amazon are almost never the result of natural causes.\n\nMeanwhile, by reorganizing the government and cutting budgets, the Bolsonaro administration has undercut environmental policing power. For the last few years, during the dry season (which runs from June to December) IBAMA has maintained an enforcement base in Novo Progresso, a city in the state of Par\u00e1 at the epicenter of the current forest fires. When IBAMA agents patrol the countryside looking for illegal logging and other violations, military police generally accompany them to ensure their safety, since Brazil ranks as one of the most dangerous countries in the world for environmental activists. But this year, shortly after demonstrations near Novo Progresso where farmers burned bridges and tires to protest IBAMA\u2019s enforcement actions, the state military police were removed from this detail. Though the police respond to the state government, it\u2019s hard not to see removing police protection as tacit permission to break the law.\n\nBolsanaro\u2019s administration declined to respond to emailed questions from TIME.\n\nOn Aug. 23, Bolsonaro made a televised speech to announce \u201czero tolerance\u201d for environmental crimes, and said Brazil would deploy its armed forces to cope with the forest fires. In the same speech, however, he reaffirmed the need to provide economic opportunity to the Amazon region\u2019s population, and there\u2019s little indication that Bolsonaro will pull back his support for expanding mining operations and large-scale farming in the region.\n\nThat\u2019s just more bad news for the Amazon\u2019s indigenous people, whose lands are some of the best preserved in the region. One of Bolsonaro\u2019s first official acts as president in early 2019 was to transfer the agency charged with supporting indigenous people, FUNAI, under the Ministry of Agriculture. Analysts say this weakens the agency\u2019s ability to protect indigenous territories. Along with suggesting that indigenous territory could be opened up for mining, Bolsonaro has also threatened to halt the certification of any new indigenous settlements.\n\nObviously, this is devastating for indigenous people. But it\u2019s also potentially catastrophic for the environment. According to a recent United Nations report, strong land rights for indigenous communities help form a bulwark against climate change. In Brazil, for example, indigenous territories are constitutionally protected. This helps maintain the forest by discouraging encroachment by farmers, miners and loggers.\n\nBut, according to Joenia Wapichana, a member of the Sustainability Network (a political party established by former Minister of the Environment Marina Silva) and the first indigenous woman elected to Brazil\u2019s senate, the Bolsonaro government has \u201cpersecuted\u201d indigenous people by attempting to halt the processes that define the boundaries of indigenous territories. The FUNAI website lists 440 fully recognized indigenous territories in Brazil. Another 127 have crossed the first hurdle in the demarcation process while a further 115 have yet to move past the initial study required to begin applying for recognition.\n\nOnce these boundaries are established, non-indigenous Brazilians are barred from using the land, creating buffer zones against deforestation.\n\nWildfire in the Amazon rainforest, near Abuna, in the Brazilian state of Rondonia on Aug. 24, 2019.

Traditional communities are generally the descendants of European settlers who practice small-scale agriculture as well as producing goods from materials that can be harvested sustainably from the forest. For example, in Montanha e Mangabal, a government-certified \u201ctraditional community\u201d with approximately 250 residents in Par\u00e1, many of the community\u2019s residents support themselves by producing oils from native plants, fishing, and raising yucca roots to make flour. The community\u2019s presence deters deforestation, says its president, Ageu Lobo Perreira. \u201c[Traditional] communities are always there watching,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t come here and attack the environment, take lumber.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, these communities are at risk thanks, Lobo Perreira says, to federal defunding of environmental protection, public education, and public healthcare. \u201cFamilies are leaving because they want their children to have a secondary-school education,\u201d Lobo Perreira says. Community members must travel more than 140 miles to the city of Itaituba for any serious health issues.\n\nFurther, these places on the frontlines of deforestation have become flash points of violence. Indigenous and traditional subsistence communities regularly report physical violence in confrontations resulting from incursions onto their land. Last year, for example, after Lobo Perreira publicly challenged miners prospecting illegally on the community\u2019s land, he received death threats that forced him to leave Montanha e Mangabal for a few months.\n\n\"These are places where the state\u2019s power, judicial power doesn\u2019t reach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you enter these more remote areas,\u201d says Andr\u00e9 Cutrim, a professor of environmental resource management at the Federal University of Par\u00e1, \u201cthese are places where the state\u2019s power, judicial power doesn\u2019t reach.\u201d The result, he says, is that it\u2019s easier to cut down trees or to start fires illegally\u2014and harder for an already hamstrung environmental agency to operate in the face of violence and lawlessness. This enables land grabbers to deforest and farm regardless of what the law permits.\n\nCutrim says the Bolsonaro government is stoking passions with its rhetoric. \u201cThe message of the current government isn\u2019t conciliatory. It\u2019s a message of confrontation,\u201d he says. This, Cutrim sustains, makes Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters feel authorized to pursue their own interests, even if that means setting fire to one of the country\u2019s treasures.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "To understand why Brazil's rainforests are burning, you need to grasp how the country has dismantled support for indigenous communities.", "authors": ["Zoe Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/brazil-amazon-fires-2.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
