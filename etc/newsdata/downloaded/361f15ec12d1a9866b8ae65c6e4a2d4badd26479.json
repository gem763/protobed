They suppress us through a law to threaten the people to stay at home. That\u2019s why we have to come out to voice our opinions,\u201d said an older woman called Mrs Mak, as she sheltered under her husband\u2019s umbrella.\n\n\u201cI have to come out to fight for the youngsters, because I am nearly 60. I come out because I have to support them. The future belongs to them. I want the government to hear what people are saying,\u201d she said.\n\nAn emergency law has criminalised protesters wearing face masks Credit: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images More\n\nThe crowd was initially peaceful but visibly nervous, at times stopping and running backwards, after months of violent clashes between police and protesters that have resulted in multiple arrests and two live shootings.\n\nBy mid-afternoon the police had fired the first tear gas canisters at protesters erecting barricades along major routes, before pushing demonstrators back to the shopping districts of Wan Chai and Causeway Bay and making multiple arrests. Tear gas was also fired in Kowloon.\n\nCarrie Lam had justified the introduction of the ban as a measure to restore calm to the city after months of unrest that began with a bill that could extradite people to China but has since spiraled into a wider call for democratic rights.\n\nSome protesters lit fires to block traffic in the city centre Credit: Vincent Thian/AP More\n\nHowever, many in Hong Kong believe the move has added fuel to the fire of simmering anger with the government and heavy-handed police action.\n\nOn Sunday morning, a group of pro-democracy lawmakers failed in a high court bid to seek an emergency injunction against the ban, arguing that emergency powers bypassed the legislature and contravened the city\u2019s mini-constitution.\n\nSharron Fast, a Hong Kong-based lawyer warned that the use of the emergency regulation had given the chief executive an \u201cunlimited amount of power, in which she alone can enact laws\".\n\nShe added: \"She has gone on record and hasn't dismissed the possibility to enact other laws with the ERO, which can include censorship laws, deportation orders, the repossession of property, and even requiring people to work.\"", "description": "Tens of thousands of masked Hong Kong citizens braved torrential rain, tear gas and arrest on Sunday as they marched through the streets of the global financial hub in open defiance of a government ban on face masks.", "authors": ["Nicola Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bZw2Quw5IW9kpR_M8nT9XQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/74fbe4ddbd5e97f3894bbcfd325173aa", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
