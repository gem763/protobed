After landing, the troops were to capture and secure key roads and bridges so Allied forces massed in Belgium could pour into Germany's industrial heartland.\n\nRecreating the mass drops of September 1944, military aircraft flew low over Ginkel Heath on Saturday and current military parachutists leaped out. Thousands of spectators watched and applauded the soldiers once they were on the ground.", "description": "Hundreds of parachutists floated out of clear blue skies in the Netherlands to mark the 75th anniversary of a daring but unsuccessful WWII mission.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88e4c92e22af1c1171e543-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
