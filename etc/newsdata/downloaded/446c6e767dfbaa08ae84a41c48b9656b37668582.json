But at a meeting in Harare on Monday, Zimbabwe's secretary for finance, George Guvamatanga, said at least $10 million (the equivalent of around R149 million) was paid last week to foreign electricity suppliers \u2013 which he did not name \u2013 with an additional payment due this week..\n\nThe Zimbabwean government had previously promised such payments, and even said they had been made, but Eskom refused to continue discussions until it had actually seen the money in its bank account.\n\nEskom told Business Insider it would reinstate supplies once payment guarantees \u2013 which should prevent future debts from piling up \u2013 are in place.\n\nOnce the financial engineering is in place, Eskom will sell Zimbabwe up to 400MW, it said. But only 50MW of that will be contracted on a \"firm basis\". The remainder, a total of some 25% of Zimbabwe's estimated national electricity needs, will be on a \"non-firm\" basis.\n\nWhen South Africa goes into load shedding \"any non-firm exports are reduced to zero and firm exports are reduced proportionally in accordance to the loadshedding stage,\" Eskom said.", "description": "The utility has confirmed that Zimbabwe has made payment arrangements for outstanding debt and will be getting 400MW worth of imports again, but most of that will be on a \"non-firm basis\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4021/6d4734484eef40adadc922d5a202243c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-05"}
