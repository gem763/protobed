She has no idea what will happen to her belongings or her three cats in the move\n\nSusan has lived in the house since 2015 and says her hoarding problem started as she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and had what she describes as a 'tough upbringing'.\n\nMs Ralphs was given eight weeks to clear the house herself, but failed to do so due to issues with her health.\n\nAn Adra spokesperson said 'Our priority is always to support and sustain tenancies and we work with partner agencies to try and prevent homelessness.\n\n'We only take legal action as a last resort. In this case, the court decided that the granting of possession was reasonable and proportionate.'", "description": "Susan Ralphs, 70, of Blaenau Ffestiniog, Wales, is to be evicted from her home by firemen after her hoarding issues have turned her house into a death trap.", "authors": ["John Bennett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19589028-0-image-a-30_1570799424787.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
