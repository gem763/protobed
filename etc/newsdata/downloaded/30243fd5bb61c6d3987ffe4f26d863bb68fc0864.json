Zavareei also provided The Daily Beast with a copy of Trump\u2019s \u201cwaiver of the service of summons\u201d\u2014necessary because it is nearly impossible to actually serve the president of the United States\u2014which is signed by \u201cCharles J. Harder.\u201d\n\nHarder\u2014who has represented the president in other matters including the lawsuit filed by porn actress Stormy Daniels\u2014did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. After publication of his scorched-earth remarks about the Trump family in Michael Wolff\u2019s book Fire & Fury, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon received a letter from Harder threatening legal action.\n\nLast year, during the rollout of UNHINGED, a \u201ctell-all\u201d authored by former Apprentice villain and ex-senior Trump administration official Omarosa Manigault Newman, Harder shot the publisher Simon & Schuster a letter warning them of legal action \u201cshould you proceed with publishing and selling the Book.\u201d\n\nHarder has also done legal work for First Lady Melania Trump, as well as for Trump son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner. Harder also repped the late Roger Ailes, an informal Trump adviser, during the former Fox News chief\u2019s sexual-harassment scandal.\n\nHogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker was underwritten by Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire and a prominent ally of Donald Trump\u2019s.\n\nIn the new lawsuit, Johnson accuses Trump of grabbing her hand and kissing her without her consent in Tampa, Florida, on August 24, 2016, when she was a staffer on his presidential campaign. When The Washington Post broke the news of the federal lawsuit late last month, the White House, as well as other Trump associates said to be present at the 2016 event, vigorously denied the allegation, with White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it \u201cabsurd on its face.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast last month, Zavareei said that his client \u201cfeels partly responsible for helping put a sexual predator into the White House, and she believes she has an obligation to tell her story and to hold him accountable for what he\u2019s done to her but to so many other women.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has faced numerous allegations from different women of sexual harassment or assault. The White House has maintained the various accusers are all simply lying.", "description": "The attorney has become a go-to counselor in Trumpworld when trying to suppress claims about its members, including the president.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1553034397/190319-trump-lawyer-tease_jcntcu", "published_at": "2019-03-19"}
