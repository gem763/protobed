By congesting the network with rented resources, the attacker was able to guarantee a winning outcome every time.\n\n\n\nAnatomy Of A Crime\n\nAs pointed out by community members on Twitter, the attacker managed to steal over 30k EOS by manipulating winning conditions in gambling dApps.\n\nThey first rented a massive amount of CPU and NET at EOS\u2019s REX resource exchange. By staking CPU and NET for themselves and the attacked contract, the attacker was able to price out most other user transactions.\n\nWith the network congested, the attacker initiated some contracts to the gambling dApps. However, with the apps relying on transactions to determine winning conditions, these could then be manipulated.\n\nThe congestion meant that only the hacker and the attacked app had enough CPU to operate. This prevented developers from stopping the attack as soon as it was discovered.\n\nBest tweet thread explaining the CPU congestion / EOSPlay exploit. #EOS https://t.co/QU5qp2C4jL \u2014 rektkid (@rektkid_) September 14, 2019\n\nEOS: Platform Of Choice?\n\nEOS overtook Ethereum as the platform of choice for users of dApps, and the vast majority of this traffic is through gambling applications. However some reports suggest that a lot of this is down to bots, and dApps are struggling to attract genuine users.\n\nCritics also attack the network for its level of centralisation, prompting founder, Dan Larimar to get a bit lairy with Bitcoin and Ethereum earlier in the year. Larimar claimed that he could \u2018take down\u2019 the two biggest cryptocurrency networks.\n\nMore recently, EOS suffered another blow to its credibility, when Wikipedia co-founder, Larry Sanger, said the network was \u201cde facto centralized in the hands of the Chinese.\u201d\n\nSanger was explaining why he felt unable to continue building his dApps on the platform.\n\nHe might have a point, as the Chinese government continues to rank EOS first in its top ten cryptocurrencies list. Bitcoin meanwhile, still fails to make the top 10.\n\nWhat do you think about this EOS dApp flaw?
