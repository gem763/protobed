More than dresses, I see them as a means to create a dialogue with my clients. I design for a living body, not for a lifeless mannequin\u201d.\n\nREAD MORE: H&M has just launched a high street wedding dress collection that makes us want to walk down the aisle right now\n\n\n\nThe Italian designer described this unthemed collection as \"a summary of my style made up of pieces anyone can interpret as they wish.
