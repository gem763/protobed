According to his offer of employment seen by mySA.com, McConaughey will reportedly take home $12,000 for every course he teaches independently and $6,000 for those he co-teaches.\n\nThe class of 1993 alumnus has taught film courses at UT since 2015 as a visiting instructor but was just formally named a full-time professor last month. McConaughey had co-taught the course, Advanced Producing: Script to Screen, with fellow UT professor Scott Rice in the school's Moody College of Communication.\n\nMcConaughey helped create the course's curriculum and will continue teaching it as a \"professor of practice\" in the school's department of radio, television, and film. In the video below posted by UT, McConaughey explains walking his students through the evolution of one of his most recent films, The Beach Bum.\n\nIt's unclear how many courses McConaughey will teach himself and how many he will co-teach this year. While compensation can vary widely for professors, the median salary for an employee at UT's Moody College of Communication hovers around $60,000 according to an analysis of the school's data by The Texas Tribune. In addition to his lectures, McConaughey's offer letter reportedly encouraged the actor to \"teach and mentor\" students in the radio and television department and across the Moody College more generally.\n\nMcConaughey's full-time status at the school may be a recent development, but his legacy on campus is not. The Uvalde, Texas, native can regularly be seen flaunting UT's burnt orange colors on social media. Just one year into his stint as a visiting professor, McConaughey obtained legendary status when videos emerged of him driving students home from a football game in a golf cart as part of UT's safe ride program.", "description": "In addition to teaching a course on screenwriting, McConaughey's offer letter encourages him to mentor students outside of class.", "authors": ["Mack Degeurin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88eefff4fc241aa37d4dac-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
