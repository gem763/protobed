We believe the school is a safe space and that this was an isolated incident.\"\n\nLesufi said he was confident the SGB would handle the disciplinary hearing properly.\n\n'Every learner should feel safe'\n\nThe school's principal, Francois de Kock, said the school strongly condemned the attack.\n\n\"We are a school that believes in morals and high standards. Every learner should feel safe when they attend our school. Parents should have peace of mind when they send their children here.\n\n\"[What happened] is very bad. The school will address this matter and strive to be better and stronger.\"\n\nAsked what the school would do to prevent a similar incident from happening, De Kock said that \u2013 while it is difficult to prevent such incidents completely \u2013 the school would be implementing measures such as monitoring the school grounds more thoroughly, especially bathrooms.\n\nALSO READ: 'Bully free' Vosloorus school empowers pupils to manage conflict\n\n\"We also need to educate our learners in terms of social media. Children should know that they should act when they witness or film something like this. We encourage them to report these incidents and not just stand by or take pictures.\"\n\nLesufi said children should be taught not to resolve differences through violence.\n\n\"If you do that, we'd have an eye for an eye, and that means all of us [become] blind.\"\n\nThe school has employed the services of social workers and psychologists, according to Lesufi.\n\n\"These things can happen at any minute\u2026 but our schools remain safe, generally. But when you have this type of incident \u2013 act, and act decisively.\"", "description": "Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has visited Ho\u00ebrskool Kempton Park where a boy was filmed assaulting another boy in the school's bathroom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9182/82150e8e826542debef62e5b4daf015e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
