Tomorrow, Mr. Sondland will finally be interviewed by impeachment investigators. I asked my colleague Michael Crowley, who covers White House foreign policy, about him.\n\nMichael, what makes Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotel owner and longtime political donor, such an odd fit as a diplomat?\n\nMany people thought Mr. Sondland was unqualified even for the job he was supposed to be doing as ambassador to the E.U. His predecessor in that job had decades of diplomatic experience and had several advanced degrees. The E.U. has 28 member states and has just a very complicated, important relationship with the U.S. that involves economics, diplomacy and security issues.\n\nSo then how did he end up as Mr. Trump\u2019s quasi-fixer in Ukraine?\n\nYou often see donors who at least appear to have bought their way into ambassadorships who then kind of keep their heads down, enjoy the job, revel in the title and the glamour. Mr. Sondland comes in like a mini Trump. He\u2019s disrupting. He\u2019s offending. Rather than many diplomats kind of buttering up their host countries, he comes in saying, \u201cThe E.U. is out of touch. It\u2019s ripping the U.S. off. The party\u2019s over.\u201d He didn\u2019t show much interest in diplomatic protocols. I spoke to one person for the story who said he is one of the Trumpiest of Trump\u2019s ambassadors.", "description": "Another official spoke with investigators, and Congress settled in before a big day of testimony.", "authors": ["Noah Weiland"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/us/politics/16dc-impeachbriefing-sub/16dc-impeachbriefing-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
