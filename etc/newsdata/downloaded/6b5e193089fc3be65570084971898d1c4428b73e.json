Invest the money, and you'll become a millionaire,'\" the former Wall Street executive tells CNBC Make It. \"There are layers of things that are wrong with this.\"\n\nKrawcheck is referring to what's known as \"the latte factor.\" Some financial experts argue if you ditch your $5-a-day latte habit \u2014 or any small luxury you indulge in on a regular basis \u2014 you'd have quite a bit of money to contribute toward investing instead. Over the course of a few decades, that money could grow substantially, and even make you a millionaire, thanks to compound interest.\n\nIt would take a lot of coffee purchases and a high annual return (10-12%) to turn your latte savings into $1 million, says Krawcheck, who now runs the digital investment platform Ellevest.\n\nHer bigger point, though, is that you don't have to eliminate small luxuries like store-bought coffee to meet your savings goals and stay on track financially. Instead, follow the 50-30-20 formula: 50% of your income should go toward your needs, 30% toward fun and 20% toward savings.\n\nBy Krawcheck's rule, nearly one-third of your money can be spent on whatever makes you happy. That could be travel, electronics, clothing or daily lattes. \"We're only on this earth a short amount of time,\" she says. \"We need to have fun.\"", "description": "Here's why Ellevest cofounder and CEO Sallie Krawcheck doesn't want you to feel guilty about buying a coffee every day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104471410-GettyImages-648057218.jpg?v=1568741185", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
