Both groups exported horror well beyond Syria\u2019s borders.\n\nThe war shattered Syria into slivers. The Islamic State established a so-called caliphate. It was vanquished by Kurdish-led forces who set up their own version of utopia in the same territory, before they, too, were pushed out this month by Turkey, which was never going to tolerate an armed Kurdish canton on its border. For Ankara, Mr. al-Assad is a safer neighbor than Kurds who dream of autonomy.\n\nOn Thursday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey outfoxed Vice President Mike Pence, who flew to Ankara to give Mr. Erdogan almost everything he wanted: a cessation of hostilities in the northeast (the Americans called it a cease-fire, the Turks a pause) and a Kurdish withdrawal from the area. Turkey appears to have dodged American sanctions and gained approval to keep its troops in northeast Syria. A day later, Mr. Erdogan said he intended to populate the zone with some of the millions of Syrian refugees currently in Turkey, but how voluntary will any returns be? It\u2019s illegal under international law to send refugees back to a country where they may be at risk, but Syria \u2014 where chemical weapons have been used repeatedly \u2014 is a graveyard for international norms.\n\nTurkey\u2019s assault has unleashed chaos. Many Islamic State members, captured and held in camps by the Kurdish-led Syrian forces, have now escaped, along with suspected affiliates and sympathizers. They will regroup, accelerating a resurgence that has already made its presence felt in parts of Iraq. What do they now have to lose?\n\nFor the Kurdish forces, backed until recently by American power, the loss of clout is especially stinging. Before 2011, hundreds of thousands of Syrian Kurds were denied citizenship in a country that did not allow them to teach their language. Because of Mr. Trump\u2019s greenlighting of the Turkish offensive, Syria\u2019s Kurds in the northeast were forced to cut a deal with Damascus, which, the Syrian deputy foreign minister said last week, views them as \u201cagents of Washington.\u201d Mr. al-Assad\u2019s forces didn\u2019t have to fire a bullet to regain huge swaths of the northeast. Idlib province, in the northwest, is now the only large part of the country that Mr. al-Assad doesn\u2019t control.", "description": "For years, the war there has affected events far beyond the country\u2019s borders.
