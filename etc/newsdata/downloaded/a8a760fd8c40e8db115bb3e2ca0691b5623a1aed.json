(African American soldiers are) relegated to the back of this history book in 1919. I felt like he deserved one, and his memory needs to be kept alive and honored for his service and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nVice said she discovered Inman didn't have a headstone after she found his name with those of 17 other black soldiers who served in the war from Tippecanoe County. She contacted the county\u2019s Veterans Services office, which paid for the marker.\n\nThe headstone features the misspelled version of Inman's name -- Inmon -- Vice told Fox News. She said the Veterans Administration went off the name and birthdate they had in its records and refused to change it.\n\nA memorial featuring a posting of colors, a 21-gun salute and the retiring of colors and taps by a local American Legion Post was held for Inman on Saturday. Vice told The Associated Press prior to the ceremony that Inman's relatives from Nevada had flown out for the tribute.\n\nInman was born in 1893 in Knoxville, Tenn., and served in the Army's 809th Pioneer Infantry, Company C. He enlisted in the military 10 years after moving with his family to Lafayette, Ind., in 1908.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe armed forces weren't desegregated until 1948, meaning Inman likely served under French command, according to the chapter's research. Black soldiers were not allowed to directly engage in combat at the time.\n\nAfter his military service, Inman returned to Lafayette. He died Nov. 25, 1973 from an apparent heart attack. He had no children.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A black World War I soldier was finally recognized for his military service over the weekend, decades after he was buried in an unmarked grave in Indiana.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/WW1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
