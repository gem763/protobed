Trump and Richard Nixon'", "language": "en", "text": "Sean Hannity is solely preventing President Trump from following in the footsteps of former President Richard M. Nixon, his Fox News colleague Geraldo Rivera said Tuesday.\n\nMr. Rivera suggested during an appearance on Mr. Hannity\u2019s prime-time opinion program that his show is singlehandedly responsible for keeping Mr. Trump in the White House.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t your show, Sean, they would destroy him absolutely. You\u2019re the difference between Donald J. Trump and Richard Nixon,\u201d Mr. Rivera said on \u201cHannity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Nixon\u2019s case, if he had someone that stuck up for him, he wouldn\u2019t have been motivated to cover up that burglary, he would\u2019ve let the perpetrators get their just desserts,\u201d added Mr. Rivera, referring to the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters that resulted in Nixon\u2019s eventual impeachment and resignation.\n\nMr. Hannity said he was not on the same page as Mr. Rivera, however.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with your analysis,\u201d Mr. Hannity replied. \u201cBut I will tell you, they lie. I\u2019m sick of it. They\u2019re hurting the country, I\u2019m sick of that, too. And their double standard is repulsive at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything you say is absolutely true,\u201d Mr. Rivera responded, \u201cBut watching your show and watching your producers work and seeing these packages where you put the lie exactly to what they\u2019re saying \u2014 who else is doing that? The nation is being fed this constant stream of propaganda and impeachment. Some of these people have been calling for his impeachment from the microsecond he was elected. This is an absolute all-out war. This is politics by another name. This is warfare directed at the president, and they won\u2019t give him a breath of air. You\u2019ve got to watch his back.\u201d\n\nMr. Hannity, an unabashed ally and defender of the president, has previously claimed to be Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest fan at Fox News, where his prime-time program has aired nightly for more than a decade.\n\nMr. Rivera, a Fox News contributor-at-large, similarly credited his colleague last year with keeping Mr. Trump in the White House, telling him then that \u201cNixon never would have been forced to resign if you existed in your current state back in 1972, \u201873, \u201874.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Democrats on Capitol Hill moved last week to start an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, making him only the fourth president in U.S. history \u2014 and the second since Nixon \u2014 to risk being removed from office by Congress.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
