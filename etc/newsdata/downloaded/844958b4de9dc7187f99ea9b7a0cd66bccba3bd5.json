He is no longer a co-host for the event and will not be attending.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has faced questions about his record on race in the past, including this past summer, when the South Bend, Ind. mayor was accused of \u201clying\u201d by constituents over a police shooting and was accused of handling the situation \u201csolely for his political gain and not for the health of the city he serves\u201d by the South Bend Fraternal Order of Police.\n\nIn May, Buttigieg polled at zero percent among black voters in South Carolina.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign on Friday drew scathing criticisms from black activists for accepting donations from Steve Patton, a former Chicago attorney who directed efforts to delay the release of a video depicting the 2014 shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald by a Chicago police office.The", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SkGVH4iTJ8WIoHWBibDn2w--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/578410ed218b03c18827bd6e2aeb9112", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
