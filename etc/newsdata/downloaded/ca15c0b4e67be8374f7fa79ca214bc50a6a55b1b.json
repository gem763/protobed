Ignore old wives\u2019 tales that peonies should not be moved \u2013 by August these early summer flowerers are entering dormancy so barely notice disturbance in autumn.\n\nPeony lovers currently have a unique opportunity to compare 180 varieties on trial at RHS Wisley.

You\u2019ll find them on the Portsmouth Field, on the far side of Battlestone Hill, and on Seven Acres, close to the main restaurant.", "description": "October is the ideal time to plant bare-root peonies and divide and move any established plants.", "authors": ["Val Bourne"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gardening/2017/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000143872071-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqsCNzwEn1rYoPN2nqjhn_yhDHldrzGhHbyuZtM8yT0k4.jpeg", "published_at": "2017-10-19"}
