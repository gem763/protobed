Landlines were restored last month, and an advisory asking tourists to not travel to the region was lifted last week. But the majority of people in the region remain without access to mobile networks or broadband internet connections.\n\nMobile phones taken out on contracts, known in India as \"post-paid\" plans, were functional across Indian-administered Kashmir on Monday. Pre-paid mobile phones remained restricted.\n\n\"It is a big relief,\" said Javed Ahmed, a Kashmiri in the region's main city of Srinagar. \"At least we can get in touch with our loved ones. But the major issue is the internet shutdown.\"\n\nThe communication restrictions have hit access to healthcare and services and rights groups have been calling for them to be removed. In August, United Nations experts termed the curbs \"a form of collective punishment\".\n\n\"Patients were not able to report to hospital due to the clampdown,\" said a psychiatrist at Srinagar's Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media. \"We hope they will do now. They missed a lot of sessions of counseling.\"\n\nNuclear-armed arch-rivals India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir. Both countries claim the region in full but rule it in part.\n\nNew Delhi maintains that some restrictions in the region are still required to combat a decades-old insurgency against its rule, which it accuses Pakistan of fomenting. Islamabad denies this, saying it provides only diplomatic and moral support to Kashmiri separatists.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Fayaz Bukhari in Srinagar; Writing by Alasdair Pal; Editing by Alex Richardson)", "description": "India restored some mobile phone services in contested Kashmir on Monday, two months after imposing a communications clampdown on the Himalayan region.
