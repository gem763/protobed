A photograph from April 8, 2010, showed a full fleet of 43 medium-sized buses and five other vehicles like minivans and trucks parked in a \u201cV\u201d formation at a gas station parking lot near Changjon Harbor at the Mount Kumgang resort.But a photograph taken a little less than a year later - on March 28, 2011 - showed the number of buses had decreased from 43 to 30. They were parked in a new formation, lined up in two rows.The former Hyundai Asan employee, who said the buses used to be driven by ethnic Koreans from China when the tours were active, said it was likely that North Korean officials or workers at the resort moved the buses since the company had no representatives in the area.By October 2013, all the vehicles at that location had disappeared, leaving the lot empty.While it is not entirely clear what happened to the vehicles, testimony from visitors suggests the North may still be using some of the buses.One civic group worker who visited Pyongyang in October 2018 said he saw two buses with Mount Kumgang tourism labels at the People\u2019s Palace of Culture in Pyongyang.\u201cThe buses looked like they had carried people to attend an event at the venue,\u201d the worker said.Another witness who visited Mount Kumgang last November while inter-Korean ties were still active, recalled seeing a bus with a license plate that read Mount Kumgang while on the road to a hot spring in the zone. \u201cThe bus was the same one used to transport South Korean tourists,\u201d the witness said.Hyundai Asan\u2019s buses and minivans used for the tours were made in South Korea. Given that 11 years have passed since the tours were suspended, it is believed that many of the vehicles may not be completely operational.\u201cThe facilities and vehicles at the Mount Kumgang tourist area are the property of a South Korean company,\u201d a government official said. \u201cIt would be a problem if North Korea used them without permission.\u201dBY JEONG YONG-SOO [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
