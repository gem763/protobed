They were part of a group of 24 children taken to safety by the UN refugee organisation.\n\nConfirming the evacuation, the organisation said: \u201c[It\u2019s] true. We did take them out from the camp to the safe location.\u201d\n\nThe British charity Save the Children said on Monday night: \u201cWe are able to confirm that the three orphaned children featured in the BBC piece were unharmed during the incidents yesterday. They were being cared for in a centre for lone children run by a local agency in Ein Issa.\n\n\u201cFollowing the escalation, they, along with 21 other [unaccompanied children], were transferred to Raqqa, where they are being looked after. Yesterday over 900 people, including 700 children, fled the annex in Ain Issa, where foreign families were staying. Most of them are unaccounted for. We are deeply concerned for their wellbeing and safety of the children among them.\n\n\u201cChildren in Syria who have fled Isis-held areas are innocent. They are swept up in horrific events far beyond their control and deserve to be safe and protected. We can and must give the British children the best chance of recovery by bringing them to the UK before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nConcern had been mounting over the fate of the children after hundreds of inmates in the camp fled shelling from Turkish forces. There were calls for the children to be repatriated to the UK amid concern they could be abducted.\n\nThe three orphans were discovered by the BBC and are believed to have travelled to Syria with their parents from London five years ago.\n\nTheir mother and father, an older brother and two other sisters were killed in an airstrike on the Isis-controlled enclave of Baghuz, which finally fell to Kurdish led-forces in March.\n\nThe BBC broadcast a moving interview with Amira on Sunday in which she described being keen to get back to the UK.\n\nShe said she and her surviving siblings have a grandmother, but she did not know her name. The children speak Arabic, but speak English when they are together and Amira has traces of a London accent. Hiba showed the camera a large scar on her abdomen, indicating the violence they appear to have endured.\n\nShortly after their whereabouts became known, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish warplanes struck villages near the camp, 20 miles south of the Turkish-Syrian border. Hundreds of people in the secure camp escaped as clashes broke out between Turkish-backed Syrian fighters and Kurdish forces, local officials said.\n\nThe camp houses about 13,000 people, including nearly 1,000 foreign women with links to Isis and their children.\n\nAccording to the Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria, about 950 residents fled. They said Isis supporters attacked guards and stormed the gates.\n\nIt later emerged that several dozen unaccompanied children in the camp had been rescued by UN staff before the breakout and taken to a safe location nearby.\n\nPlay Video 4:04 What does Turkey's military action in northern Syria mean? \u2013 video explainer\n\nTurkey is fighting for control of an area of Kurdish-controlled northern Syria with the tacit backing of the US \u2013 which previously counted the Kurds as allies, but withdrew troops from the area early last week.\n\nThe chaos at the camp led to some US troops withdrawing from a base in Ain Issa because of the threat posed by Syrian fighters allied with Turkey. A US military official said the situation across north-east Syria was \u201cdeteriorating rapidly\u201d and that American forces were cut off from the Syrian Kurdish fighters.\n\nAt least 750 Isis affiliates escape Syria camp after Turkish shelling Read more\n\nAmira, whose surname is not known, told the BBC she left London at the age of five but recalled aspects of life in the UK, saying she would \u201cgo to a park, go to a funfair, go to a restaurant\u201d.\n\nSpeaking in English, she then described the attack in which her parents and three siblings died.\n\n\u201cThey were hitting so much,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a little house and that big dusty mountain and behind it everybody was dead. In front of us was everyone who was not killed, the other people.\n\n\u201cWe were going to pack our stuff and get out, the airplane came and bombed. So then my mum died, my littlest brother, my little brother and my sister. Then after that, all was getting on fire. We had to walk out.\u201d\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThere may be British children in internally displaced persons camps in Syria who, because of their age, are innocent victims of the conflict. We look at all evidence to determine someone\u2019s nationality and will examine every single case where we are asked for consular assistance, but this process is far from straightforward.\u201d", "description": "Children taken to safety in Raqqa after hundreds of people fled camp holding Islamic State affiliates in northern Syria", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont", "Robert Booth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e5947de7f657ab896ee700c2391570eba9d1d24/0_312_5360_3215/master/5360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b6c44554e1f1e3d157d1ac5beec7dfc", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
