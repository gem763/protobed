Judge takes on privilege as she sentences parents in college scam", "language": "en", "text": "BOSTON \u2013 As U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani prepared to sentence a Los Angeles business executive in the nation's college admissions scandal last month, she first had something to say about the motives of parents like him.\n\nThe father and businessman, Devin Sloane, told the judge he \"wanted what was best for my son.\" That's why he paid $250,000 to Rick Singer, the mastermind of a nationwide admissions scheme, to get him into the University of Southern California posing as a water polo recruit.\n\nBut was Sloane really trying to help his child, the judge asked, or to make himself look good?\n\n\u201cI find that\u2019s at issue in all of these cases,\" Talwani said from the dais in the packed courtroom. \"It\u2019s not basic caretaking for your child. It\u2019s not getting your child food or clothing. It\u2019s not even getting your child an education. It\u2019s getting your child into a college that you call \u2018exclusive.\u2019\n\n\"Are they doing this for their children or their own status?\u201d\n\nTalwani, a 59-year-old President Barack Obama appointee to the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, has handed down each of the five sentences so far to parents charged in the \"Varsity Blues\" scandal. Each has gotten some amount of prison time. Sloane, founder and CEO of waterTALENT, received four months.\n\nMassachusetts U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, pictured here at her 2014 confirmation hearing, has offered a blunt critique of the wealthy elite and economic inequities in higher education during her sentencing of parents in the national college admissions scandal. More\n\nSix more parents who have pleaded guilty are set to be sentenced by Talwani this month, beginning today with the first couple, Gregory and Marcia Abbott. The Abbotts, who reside in New York and Aspen, Colorado, paid a total of $125,000 to have their daughter's college entrance exams answers fixed to get her into Duke University, her mother's alma mater.\n\nThe judge isn't just doling out prison terms. In holding parents accountable, Talwani has embraced the admission scam's societal significance, openly addressing the public outage that surrounds it and offering a blunt critique of the wealthy elite who used cash to cheat an admissions system some say already is stacked to their advantage.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said the case and Talwani's remarks \"reflect what people are thinking in the broader society\" \u2013 and their concerns.\n\n\"People are thinking about it,\" he said. \"It's raising lots of questions for people.\"\n\nRelated: LA exec gets 4 months in prison for paying $400K to get son into Georgetown as a fake tennis recruit\n\nWhen parents, such as Stephen Semprevivo, said they paid into Singer's scheme out of fear during the college admissions process, Talwani pushed back. The former Cydcor executive paid $400,000 to get his son into Georgetown University as a fake tennis recruit.\n\n\"Think about how terrifying that process is for the applicant whose parents didn't go to college,\u201d Talwani said at his sentencing hearing. She singled out inner-city and rural children who lacked resources but made it to college anyway. \u201cTheir legitimacy is challenged every day that somehow they were the ones who got a break to get there.\u201d\n\nCalifornia businessman Stephen Semprevivo departs after his sentencing hearing at federal court in Boston, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019.
