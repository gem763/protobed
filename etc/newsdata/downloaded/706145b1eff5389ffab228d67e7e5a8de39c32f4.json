A partial trade deal is currently being worked out between the two countries.\n\n\"I'd estimate that range to be 0.50% either side of 7.0750 up until 16th Nov \u2014 with a slight bias to the downside,\" he said, referring to next month's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting which will be attended by U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The currency pair will likely head toward 7.00 if the two sides are able to sign an agreement in Chile, he added.\n\nFor its part, the U.S. last week held off from raising tariffs from 25% to 30% on $250 billion worth of Chinese products.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, the new tariffs would go into effect if no agreement is in place before the next deadline on Dec. 15. Trump's top economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network on Monday that he sees the possibility of the December tariff hikes being taken off the board if trade talks go well.", "description": "Experts say the yuan is expected to remain above the 7-per-dollar level in the near term, as the U.S. and China try to iron out details of a partial trade deal.", "authors": ["Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106064362-1565137946662gettyimages-611272452.jpeg?v=1565138064", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
