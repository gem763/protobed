How tragic 'Zombieland' victim Bill Murray ended up in the sequel", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The trailer for the \"Zombieland\" sequel is finally here featuring Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin and Jesse Eisenberg. USA TODAY\n\nWait a minute here. We're pretty sure Bill Murray died a tragic and frankly Oscar-worthy death in 2009's \"Zombieland.\"\n\nSo how did Murray just show up in the upcoming sequel \"Zombieland: Double Tap\" (in theaters Oct. 18)? He looks very alive, a decade later, in the red band trailer released Monday.\n\n\"Given that Bill Murray was probably everyone\u2019s favorite part of the first movie, we always wanted to have another cameo,\" says Ruben Fleischer, who directed both zombie comedies. \"In classic Hollywood tradition, we figured out a way to reverse engineer Bill Murray into the movie.\"\n\nThe original appearance was a Murray masterclass, as the four zombie apocalypse survivors \u2013 Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) \u2013 were thrilled to see that the star had managed to survive. He even donned his \"Ghostbusters\" outfit to re-create a scene to break the survival monotony.\n\n'Zombieland: Double Tap': Watch the first trailer featuring zombies in the White House\n\nBill Murray shows off the \"Ghostbusters\" outfit he rocked in \"Zombieland\" before his own tragic end.

I cannot believe I shot Bill Murray,\" said Columbus, as Murray mumbled, \"My bad. I was never very good at practical jokes.\" He had enough time to utter his one regret, making 2004's \"Garfield,\" before passing. His body was tossed over the balcony. Definitely dead.\n\nThe academy overlooked the performance, but Murray did win a 2010 Scream Award for playing Bill Murray.\n\nThe sequel takes place 10 years into the zombie mayhem. But the filmmakers still found a way in with Murray, who's interviewed by Al Roker in the scene.\n\n\"We went back to the day the zombie apocalypse happened in 2009 and that where\u2019s we find Bill Murray,\" says Fleischer. \"He's at a junket promoting 'Garfield 3.' \"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/07/zombieland-2-new-trailer-brings-bill-murray-back-dead/3902825002/", "description": "Bill Murray's brief cameo (as himself) was the best part of \"Zombieland.\" Until he was accidentally killed.
