What a chauvinistic chap. Your girlfriend does the housework - so you don't know what a tog is?! And you call your mother to ask what a monkey nut is. Can we not have just narrow minded teachers in our schools teaching the future gen (sic).'\n\nAnother tweeted: 'OMG the teacher on #whowantstobeamillionaire doesn't know what tog ratings or monkey nuts are... I worry for our children's education.'\n\nNick Parkhouse, a new dad from Croydon, was also mercilessly mocked for not knowing what a tog rating was when he got to the \u00a31,000 question\n\nNick took to the stage towards the end of the ITV programme, after the previous contestant, Suzy, went home with \u00a332,000.\n\nHe managed to race through the first few rounds, but was stopped in his tracks when it came to the crunch \u00a31,000 question.\n\nHost Jeremy Clarkson asked: 'A tog rating is given to which of these household items?'\n\nNick was then given the option of a refrigerator, saucepan, suitcase or duvet.\n\nHe then made the admission that his wife Charlotte, who was supporting him in the audience, does all the housework, so he had 'no idea'.\n\nNick claimed he didn't know the answer because his 'wife does the housework', so he asked the audience\n\nNick used his first lifeline to ask the audience - 94 per cent of which correctly selected the duvet.\n\nRealising he'd had a shocker, Nick admitted to Jeremy: 'Doesn't make me look very good, does it?'\n\nThings went from bad to worse when he hit another stumbling block going for the next \u00a32,000 question.\n\nIt asked: 'Which of these is another common name for a monkey nut?' with the possible answers being peanut, walnut, hazelnut and Brazil nut.\n\nViewers didn't hold back when it came to commenting on Nick's game, with one asking 'is this for real?'\n\nNick chose to phone his mum, who admitted she too wasn't sure but thought it was a peanut.\n\nAfter the call Nick revealed he had thought it was peanut and decided to 'trust his gut'.\n\nHe went on to make it to \u00a38,000 before the show ran out of time; he's set to return next week.\n\nViewers didn't hold back when it came to commenting on Nick's game, with one asking: 'Is this for real?'\n\n'Hope his wife spends all the money on #duvets with a very high #tog rating!' joked another.\n\nOne viewer wrote: 'Well, that guy on #wwtbam was a right noob. How can you reach adulthood and not know what a tog rating is? \"My wife does the housework\".'\n\nMany viewers couldn't resist questioning how Nick didn't know was a tog rating was, but some viewers were sympathetic towards him, with one admitting: 'Sadly my network engingeer hubby would have said exactly the same as this teacher'\n\n'He has a three-month-old at home?? And his wife does all the housework?? Poor thing must be shattered. Bet he hogs the duvet too, all 20togs of it,' asked another.\n\nOne revealed: 'Just walked into my living room with my tea, husband and was watching #whowantstobeamillionaire, sat down, the TEACHER on the show was struggling to know what a monkey nut was and what item had a tog rating because his \"wife does the housework\": left.'\n\nWhile one asked: 'What's a duvet got to do with housework? He should lose just for that comment alone.'\n\nThough some were sympathetic towards Nick, with one admitting: 'Sadly my network engingeer hubby would have said exactly the same as this teacher lol. He also wouldn't know that tog size is usually on a duvet (sic).'", "description": "Nick Parkhouse, a new dad from Croydon, was mercilessly mocked for not knowing what a tog rating is or that a peanut is a common name for monkey nut - despite working as a teacher.", "authors": ["Hayley Richardson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/19388394-0-image-a-80_1570441492765.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
