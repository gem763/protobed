And they obviously liked what I was saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met both Peter and Fran and took it from there.\u201d\n\nFoster said the issue of a financial donation to his campaign from the couple did not arise until a few weeks before the election campaign started. \u201cThe conversation we had about Shelly Bay was a substantial time before anything came up supporting a mayoral campaign.\u201d\n\n'Gotta save Lorde': fans start mock campaign to break singer out of jail Read more\n\nFoster has since been accused of being little more than a \u201cpuppet\u201d for Jackson, whose donations are entirely legal. Foster said Shelly Bay was the only issue he and the couple discussed and overlapped on. \u201cIn terms of financial support, that only happened the week before putting my hand up for mayor,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exact figure the couple donated is unknown, but Foster said it would appear in his election return. He said the number could not be revealed because the couple had not given permission. Total donations from donors who had requested not to be named total NZ$36,000 (\u00a317,500). Foster\u2019s total election spend was NZ$56,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a reticence, it\u2019s simply that it\u2019s their information until it has to be public and I am respecting that ... All I can say is it\u2019s obviously a material contribution to my campaign. Whether it\u2019s $10,000 or $12,000 or $15,000 or whatever, it\u2019s kind of like, from a story point of view it\u2019s material.\u201d\n\nA number of political commentators say Foster\u2019s successful mayoral bid was due to the high-profile support and financial backing of the couple, but Foster denies this, saying \u201csuccess has many parents\u201d.\n\nHowever he did say that in his previous bids for mayor, donations had totalled as little as NZ$150.\n\nFoster said critics describing him as a \u201cpuppet\u201d of Peter Jackson didn\u2019t know who he was or what he stood for, and were actually \u201cjudging themselves\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am an independent person with an independent mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what kind of world some people live in, it\u2019s a world based on a huge degree of cynicism. I\u2019m sad that that\u2019s the case. So they can think what they like, but they are profoundly wrong.\u201d\n\nSanjay Patel (@spat106) Peter Jackson's greatest puppets\n\n2) Those created by Weta Workshop\n\n1) Andy Foster\n\nIn emails released by Jackson in April on his personal Facebook page, the director objected to the style and location of the new housing development in Shelly Bay, and the disruption to daily life in the neighbouring suburb of Miramar by trucks, building suppliers and construction pollution.
