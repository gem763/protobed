Hitachi ended flat and Honda fell 0.7%.\n\nWhile the deal will loosen Honda\u2019s grip over its long-time suppliers, it will allow better access to technology developed by Hitachi\u2019s automotive arm, whose 971 billion yen annual revenue dwarfs Showa and Keihin\u2019s combined sales of 636 billion yen.\n\nHitachi Automotive Systems, whose name will be used for the merged company, produces a wide range of components from electric power steering systems, millimetre-wave radar used in self-driving cars, and EV invertors.\n\nHonda\u2019s Showa makes shock absorbers and steering systems, Keihin produces engine, and Nissin manufactures brake systems.\n\n\u201cAll of Honda\u2019s suppliers have been a relatively small entities ... Now it can have a stake in a major auto parts supplier,\u201d said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA.\n\n\u201cWhatever control they are losing over Keihin for example, is not a big loss compared with what they\u2019re going to gain.\u201d\n\nHonda has struggled to shore up its automobile operations, as its profitability has more than halved in the past two years due to an ongoing series of quality-related issues, constraining its financial firepower to invest in new vehicle technologies.\n\nThe proposed deal will further deepen the two automakers\u2019 ties after they established a joint venture to develop, produce and sell EV motors in 2017.", "description": "Hitachi Ltd <6501.T> will merge its vehicle components unit with Honda's <7267.T> three suppliers in a bid to cut development costs and better respond to a rapid industry shift to electric vehicles (EV) and self-driving.", "authors": ["Naomi Tajitsu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
