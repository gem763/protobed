Largely undiscussed when conditions are weak, it reappears in property market conversations from the early days of a recovering market \u2013 exactly the conditions we have today on the eastern seaboard.\n\nUnderquoting occurs when estate agents knowingly quote a property below where the market value lies, which misleads buyers, who end up wasting their time and money pursuing properties beyond their budget.\n\nState governments, which have responsibility for consumer affairs, have been busy in recent years trying to stamp out the practice.\n\nIn broad terms, they\u2019ve taken one of two approaches. The first demands transparency and evidence from agents. In Victoria, agents must provide a quote and are expected, where possible, to support it with prices from recently sold comparable properties. They must also change the quote if new information comes to hand during the sales campaign. The second approach starts with the attitude that agents\u2019 quotes are inherently and incurably misleading, so are banned altogether. That\u2019s the Queensland way. NSW lets the agents choose between either of the opposites: evidence-based transparency or no quoting.\n\nIn places where quoting remains, regulators have sought to address the related issue of a vendor\u2019s secret reserve sitting above the quote range. This is a problem because even if the property is quoted fairly by the agent, buyers can be frustrated when the property is passed in above the quote. This is not underquoting, although the result is the same: a property that can\u2019t be bought within the quote range.\n\nIn Victoria and NSW, agents are required to raise the quote range to reflect any above-quote written offers rejected by the vendor.", "description": "A changing market means it's even more important to be transparent about the price range and the seller's reserve price.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_82/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c22c5a4f3be480672dbb9d8f51311ac75935338c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
