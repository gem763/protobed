I find it staggering this facility is not being used.\n\nI was astonished when VAR did not instruct a penalty should be awarded to Gerard Deulofeu\n\nI'm sure the referees are happy with the system because they are not being blamed \u2014 all of the focus is on VAR. That is why we need to give referees the final call and, if a review of a decision is necessary, let them take another look.\n\nAt Spurs on Saturday, Jan Vertonghen tripped Watford's Gerard Deulofeu in the area and my immediate thought was: 'Penalty.' I was astonished when VAR did not intervene and instruct that a penalty should be awarded. The defender made no contact with the ball and tripped his opponent. At the very least the referee should have been told to take a second look.\n\nMike Riley, head of the PGMOL, said recently there had been four VAR errors this season. I, like many others, believe there have been far more, especially when it comes to fouls in the penalty area being missed. We cannot have mistakes when the VAR official has every angle available to him.\n\nVAR is here to stay, we need to accept that, but it has been undermined by inconsistency\n\nHowever, I am not surprised that no penalty appeal has been overturned by VAR this season.\n\nNow that could be because the bar for intervention is set too high, or a VAR official does not want to upset his mate who is the referee.\n\nEither way, it needs urgent review. Incidents like the big screen at Tottenham incorrectly showing 'No Goal' after the review for Dele Alli's goal do not help. Alli's equaliser was correctly allowed to stand \u2014 the ball hit shoulder, not arm.", "description": "MARK CLATTENBURG: I believe the time has now arrived for the PGMOL to arrange a taskforce with players, coaches, media and supporters and listen to ways in which VAR can be improved.", "authors": ["Mark Clattenburg For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19965020-0-image-a-72_1571602325875.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
