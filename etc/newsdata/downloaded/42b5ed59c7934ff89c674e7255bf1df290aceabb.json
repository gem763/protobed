There was a wooden door inside which Teddy had scratched and chewed along with exposed electrical wires.\n\n\u201cIt was a warm day and he appeared desperate for water - drinking every bowl we put in front of him. The environment was completely unhygienic and the large build-up of faeces suggested it had not been cleaned in some time.\u201d\n\n(Image: HullLive/ WS)\n\nDespite previous advice by the RSPCA, Furtado did not keep his dog's environment clean and conditions had deteriorated to an unacceptable level.\n\nInspector Dickinson attended Furtado\u2019s business address in Oxford Street, Wincolmlee, in May this year, along with a Welfare Officer from Hull City Council .\n\nThey found the dog walking in his own urine and faeces, which led to some sores developing on his paws, although they were not infected.\n\nTeddy had skin irritation, particularly under his chin.\n\nThe smell emanating from the unit was so strong that it could be smelt from outside, the inspector found.\n\n(Image: HullLive/ WS)\n\nAlongside the five-year ban from keeping dogs, Furtado was sentenced to a 12-month community order to include 180 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to pay \u00a3700 costs and an \u00a385 victim surcharge.\n\nThe defendant said he left the dog for a few days because he did not have anyone else who could look after him.\n\nA deprivation order was made by the Deputy District Judge who heard the case, entitling the RSPCA to rehome Teddy at the end of the 21-day appeal period.", "description": "Teddy the American Bully was rescued from a property on Hemswell Avenue in east Hull and is now looking for his forever home", "authors": ["Hannah Robinson", "Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Hulllive", "Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20535722.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Shocking-pictures-show-disgusting-squalor-abandoned-dog-was-locked-up-in-by-heartless-ownerTeddy-th.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
