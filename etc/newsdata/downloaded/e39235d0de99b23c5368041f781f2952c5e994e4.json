Despite low unemployment and a frothy stock market, voters feel a deep anxiety about the future and a dark anger at the political system.\n\nWith just a year to go before election day, global alliances are fraying as the U.S. turns inward. The culture wars are raging on campus and off. For only the fourth time in American history, a U.S. president is being investigated by the U.S. House of Representatives with an eye toward impeachment. Immigrants are being demonized and detained; homelessness is reaching crisis levels in big cities; and craven, self-interested lawmakers have Congress paralyzed, unable to act effectively on these and other policy issues, including the terribly urgent matter of climate change, which threatens our very existence.\n\nFlitting above this chaotic landscape \u2014 fomenting, provoking, preening, spewing, tweeting, blustering and bullying \u2014 is President Donald Trump, the worst, most dangerous president in modern history.\n\nAll presidential elections are uniquely consequential, but a good case can be made that the next one is the most important of our lives. The time has come to undo the great mistake of 2016 and drive Trump out of office at the ballot box. It is time to pull our country out of the illiberal abyss into which it is sinking and put it on a path toward reason and fairness and empathy and constructive engagement with the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe nascent impeachment process, important as it may yet become, is by most current estimations unlikely to lead to Trump\u2019s removal by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. And in any case, impeachment is not the preferred way of ousting a president in a democracy. Voters need to keep their eyes on the prize: defeating Trump state by state, issue by issue, vote by vote in November of next year.\n\nBut stopping him is not going to be nearly as easy as common sense says it ought to be. The country is profoundly riven: More than 60 million Americans consciously chose this president over his opponent four years ago. And many voters remain entranced \u2014 hoodwinked, in our view \u2014 by his blunt, cocky, overpromising style. He may be coddling dictators, selling off the planet to oil, gas and mining interests, cynically stirring racial resentment and animosity toward immigrants, and provoking an angry trade war with a rising China, but his base remains steadily, stubbornly supportive.\n\nWe need not explain here why Trump is temperamentally unsuited to be president \u2014 we have said it many times, including in our 2017 series \u201cOur Dishonest President,\u201d and we say it again today in a separate article.\n\nSuffice to say, the country is in the hands of a president for whom everything is transactional, for whom anything and anyone can be bought and sold. Lies, threats and empty promises are his weapons of choice; enemies are mocked and belittled while the dumbly obedient are rewarded. Ignorant and incurious, unmoved by reasoned argument, contemptuous of laws and institutions, Trump is in thrall to exactly the special interests you would expect, he is schooled at the university of Fox News, he is on a constant search for adulation and short-term advantage. He must be defeated in November 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the moment, more than a dozen candidates are jostling for the right to take him on, saying that they have the strategy, the credentials, the money, the message \u2014 and all the other intangible and ineffable skills and qualities it takes to become president.\n\nSome boast decades of experience; others are new to the national stage. Some may be damaged goods or past their primes; others may be charming and glib, but unseasoned or unprepared \u2014 that\u2019s what the primary process is designed to clarify. There are a couple of long-shot Republican primary candidates \u2014 such as former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld \u2014 but the true challenge comes from the Democrats, whose field includes a former vice president, a couple of former prosecutors, a democratic socialist, some U.S. senators, a businessman and the mayor of a medium-sized city in the heartland. Among the serious contenders are an unprecedented number of black and female candidates. (Prepare to be told that they can\u2019t win, but be careful what you believe.)\n\nIt goes without saying that the most pronounced divisions in the country are between left and right, between liberals and conservatives. But stark differences have emerged also among Democrats, who are now engaged in a heated battle for the soul and direction of their party. Does the country need a drastic overhaul or merely some reforms and a return to the Obama years? Should we abolish ICE? Socialize healthcare? Offer free college and a guaranteed income and a cancellation of all healthcare debt? Or are these promises unrealistic, unnecessary, outside the mainstream and likely to lose a candidate more votes than they win?\n\nNow is no time to watch from the sidelines.\n\nThis debate between the progressives and the moderates is an important one; by all means, let\u2019s have it. But on two issues, we hope the candidates will agree: first, that the top priority has to be defeating the incumbent, who is too irresponsible to be allowed another term; and second, that his defeat is only a first step. Even before Trump was elected, the country was divided and the old system wasn\u2019t working. Political paralysis was already on the rise well before November 2016, symbolized by repeated government shutdowns, angry and bruising Supreme Court nomination battles, the gradual disappearance of moderate Democrats and Republicans, the decline of bipartisanship and the rise of incivility and rejectionism. Something needs to change. Anyone who is not convinced of that should just remember the name Merrick Garland.\n\nThis is the first article in a series by the Los Angeles Times editorial board taking on several aspects of the race to come. This is not our endorsement, which will be written later in the campaign. In this series we will seek to answer some basic questions: What is our brief against President Trump and why is it so important that he be defeated? How should voters think about the tricky question of \u201celectability\u201d \u2014 whether to vote for the candidate that most appeals to them or to vote more strategically for the one with the best chance of winning? We\u2019ll begin to look at some of the policy issues arising in the race, we\u2019ll examine the battle between progressives and moderates, and we\u2019ll consider the importance of race and racism in the election. For Californians in particular, whose policies are especially loathed by this president and who have so often felt the brunt of his disdain, this election is supremely important.\n\nNow is no time to watch from the sidelines. Voters must become engaged, learn the issues, choose sides, speak out. Removing Donald Trump from office in November 2020 is absolutely essential \u2014 and yet it is by no means a sure thing. So do not sit this one out.
