They will be asked to vote on the proposal in mid-November.\n\nIf the plan is approved, non-executives will be paid a new retainer of R50,000 per year, before being paid per meeting. For the four regularly scheduled meetings they are expected to attend, that will make for R300,000 per year, a 20% increase.\n\nThose also attending meetings of sub committees on audit, risk and governance, remuneration, ethics, and technology, will receive increases of 40% over what had previously been planned.\n\nAll of those committees have three regularly scheduled meetings per year. Ordinary members of those committees will now earn at least R105,000 per year. The sub-committee chairs will make R210,000 each, for a total of a little over half a million rand.\n\nMeetings outside the expected ones will come with payments of R5,000 per hour \u2013 unless they run to more than three hours, in which case each director will receive a full meeting fee of at least R62,500 for ordinary board meetings and R35,000 for sub committees.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Shareholders who lost a lot of money on paper are being asked to approve overtime rates of R5,000 per hour for non-executive directors cleaning up the company.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7934/9782b1487fab4f479cb0082e8f05585c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
