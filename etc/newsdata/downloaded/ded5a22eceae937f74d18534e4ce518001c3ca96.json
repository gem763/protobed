He was lauded by the Nationals for his organization and its work in helping feed those in need.\n\nThe world-renowned chef, who is originally from Spain, posted his thanks on Twitter Monday. \"Thank you @Nationals @MLB @astros For inviting an immigrant! To throw first pitch! In a game full of immigrants! Inviting me representing millions of first responders doing amazing work helping everyone!

Chants of \"Lock him up!\" broke out in some sections, including one below where the president was sitting. Later in the game several fans also unfurled a big \"Impeach Trump\" banner in the stands.\n\nAndr\u00e9s and President Trump have publicly feuded in recent years. In 2016, the chef canceled plans to bring one of his restaurants to the president's D.C. hotel, blaming Mr. Trump's rhetoric on immigrants. In an interview on \"CBS This Morning\" last year, Andr\u00e9s said Mr. Trump deserved some of the blame for the death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.", "description": "Andr\u00e9s, a frequent Trump critic, got a much more positive reception than the president, who was booed at the game", "authors": ["Christopher Brito"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/28/3c8d2157-1794-4bce-9dbb-0d8174162f45/thumbnail/1200x630g2/16b552b1782e4adb25383feb7866460f/gettyimages-1183851145.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
