I have been working in long term healthcare since I was 16. Working with the elderly has always been a huge passion to me. What I got to be a part of today was the most beautiful experience, this amazing couple has been married 72 years today. Not only was I able to get this beautiful bride a dress and doll her all up, but I was also able to take pictures of their very special day and capture the love and commitment they have for each other, even after 72 years. Leonard and Shirley are such a beautiful example of what true love is and prove that when you truly love someone, you fix what is broken and love each other through all the hard times you may face. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how it felt to witness so much love and emotion today, seeing the look on Leonard\u2019s face when I brought Shirley out was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. It\u2019s days like today that I feel so blessed to do what I do..... because in the end, love is the only thing that truly matters. Thank you Leonard and Shirley for reminding me what life is all about, you are truly an inspiration to me. I love you both.\n\nTheir pictures speak volumes of the love and commitment they have towards one another. They say, age does not matter.
