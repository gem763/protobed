What Donald Trump and the Republican Party are doing\u2026 think about this, Anderson. They are denying Americans the right to vote.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend state party organizations for Kansas, South Carolina, Nevada and Arizona all nixed their 2020 primaries, providing an obstacle for Mr. Walsh and fellow challengers former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld\u2019s already long-shot bids to unseat Mr. Trump.\n\nThe incumbent president \u2014 who has a high approval rating among Republicans \u2014 said the states \u201cdon\u2019t want to waste their money\u201d on opponents who are \u201ca total joke.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Cooper pointed out that other parties have canceled primaries in elections past, Mr. Walsh brushed it off, saying in such cases there were no challengers who had come forward to run against the president.\n\n\u201cIt happened with Obama and the [Democratic] Party [in 2012] when there was no presidential primary opposition at all,\u201d Walsh explained. \u201cRight now, Anderson, you\u2019ve got three credible challengers, two former Republican governors, and a former Republican congressman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know we get numb and I get numb in this world of Trump, because every day there\u2019s a scandal, every day there\u2019s an outrage, every day, Anderson, there are attacks on our democracy,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cBut this goes well beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is trying to prevent people from voting. Think about that. He\u2019s in cahoots with the Republican Party to disenfranchise voters. Every voter in South Carolina, Arizona, and Kansas ought to be marching with pitchforks right now,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
