REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\n\nIran\u2019s crude oil exports were reduced by more than 80% when the United States re-imposed sanctions on the country last November after President Donald Trump pulled out of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\n\n\u201cWe will use every possible way to export our oil and we will not succumb to America\u2019s pressure because exporting oil is Iran\u2019s legitimate right,\u201d Zanganeh said.\n\nIn response, Iran has gradually scaled back its commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal, under which Tehran accepted to curb its nuclear activities in return for lifting most international sanctions.\n\nThe increasing U.S. pressure on Iran has scared away foreign investors from doing business in the country.\n\nLast year, China\u2019s National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) replaced French oil company Total (TOTF.PA) as the operator of Phase 11 project at South Pars gas field after the French company ended its participation rather than violate U.S. sanctions.\n\nBut late last year, CNPC suspended investment in the field in response to U.S. pressure.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s CNPC has totally pulled out of the South Pars Phase 11 development and Iran\u2019s Petropars company will carry out the job,\u201d SHANA quoted Zanganeh as saying.\n\nIran has the world\u2019s second-largest reserves of natural gas, but it has not yet become a major exporter because of international sanctions imposed on the country for decades.\n\nSHANA also quoted Zanganeh saying that Iran wanted to improve ties with Gulf Arab countries.\n\n\u201cWe want to be friends with all regional countries ... they must not regard us as their enemy ... Our mutual enemy is outside the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly clashed at meetings of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over oil output policies. Tensions between the two countries flared after Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for an attack on Saudi oil facilities on Sept. 14., a charge Tehran denies.\n\nRelated Coverage Zanganeh says Iran wants better ties with regional countries - SHANA\n\n\u201cWe have no dispute with Saudi Arabia ... I have no problem to meet with Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister,\u201d Zanganeh said.\n\nSeparately, Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organisation (AEOI) reiterated on Sunday that the country would reduce its commitments under the deal further if the European parties to the pact did not meet promises to shield Iran\u2019s economy from U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe will go ahead with our plans to decrease our commitments to the nuclear deal if other parties fail to keep their promises,\u201d the Students News Agency ISNA quoted AEOI\u2019s spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi as saying.", "description": "Iran will not succumb to U.S. pressure and will use every possible way to export its oil, Iranian Oil Ministry's website SHANA quoted Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh as saying on Sunday.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437640321&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9504J", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
