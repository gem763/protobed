Thunberg, 16, is currently in California.\n\nBut Sofia and Isabella Axelsson quoted Thunberg as saying that \u201cwhat we need is for our rulers and politicians to listen to the research.\u201d\n\nThe Nordic Council hands out annual prizes for literature, youth literature, film, music and the environment, each worth 350,000 Danish kroner ($52,000).\n\nIt was not the first prize that the climate activist has won or been nominated for.\n\nThree Norwegian lawmakers nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize this year because they believe \u201cthe massive movement Greta has set in motion is a very important peace contribution.\u201d\n\nLast year, about three months into her school climate strike campaign, Thunberg declined another award \u2014 the Children\u2019s Climate Prize, which is awarded by a Swedish electricity company \u2014 because many of the finalists had to fly to Stockholm for the ceremony.\n\nThunberg notes that flights contribute to global warming, so she sailed across the Atlantic Ocean for two weeks on a zero-emissions sailboat to reach New York. There the Swede scolded a U.N. climate conference in September, repeatedly asking, \u201cHow dare you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction and yet all you can talk about is money. You are failing us,\u201d she said.\n\nWeeks later, Thunberg won the 2019 Right Livelihood Award \u2014 known as the \u201cAlternative Nobel\u201d \u2014 \u201cfor inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts.\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, she was featured on the cover of Time magazine, which named her a \u201cnext generation leader.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has inspired millions across the world to stage protests urging leaders to better tackle global warming, has declined an environmental prize, saying \"the climate movement does not need any more prizes.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/25/Thunberg_Vancouver_53803.jpg-23fb2_c0-223-5364-3352_s1200x700.jpg?26fb028350671ebb775fbc3d071fefffe3333c26", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
