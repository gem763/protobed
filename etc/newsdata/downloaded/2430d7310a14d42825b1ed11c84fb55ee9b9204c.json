Video of the attack, which the UN says took place on Oct. 12, circulated on social media.\n\nThe same day, the UNOHCHR reports, Ahrar al-Sharqiya apparently executed three Kurds, only one of whom was wearing a military uniform. The New York Times reports at least two killed. The UNOHCHR report also refers to an Oct. 13 incident in which at least four civilians, including two journalists, were killed by a Turkish airstrike while transiting the Tel-Tamor -Ras al-Ain Highway. The UNOHCHR stressed that it had not yet been able to confirm the report. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that two Syrian Kurdish journalists, Saad Ahmed and Mohammed Hussein Rasho, were killed in the strike. Ahmed died of his wounds shortly after the strike, and Rasho reportedly died on Oct. 14.\n\nFighters with the so-called Syrian National Army called the Kurds \"pigs\" and \"infidels,\" and in one video their forces shot a man whose arms were bound behind his back, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"Under international human rights and international humanitarian law, summary executions are serious violations \u2013 and may amount to a war crime,\" the UNOHCHR report stresses.\n\n\"Turkey could be deemed responsible as a State for violations committed by their affiliated armed groups, as long as Turkey exercises effective control over these groups, or the operations in the course of which those violations occurred.\"\n\nThe UNOHCHR also reports that five medical facilities in Syria have been damaged by alleged Turkish air strikes since the Turkish incursion occurred, including one belonging to the Kurdish Red Crescent.\n\nAs of Sunday, CNN reported that forces allied with the Turkish military had killed 11 civilians, including Khalaf. According to the UNOHCHR, Turkish authorities have claimed 18 civilian deaths in the fighting, including a 9-month-old infant, killed during cross-border mortar and sniper attacks by Kurdish forces.", "description": "Videos and reports from Syria suggest Turkish-backed forces are allegedly committing war crimes, including the execution of a Kurdish politician.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da751a54af90968f85bc8f2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
