As technology allows us to know we\u2019re pregnant just after a missed period, it allows partners to become bonded to babies far earlier than they might have been in previous generations. There\u2019s a case study in Bueno\u2019s book about a woman who miscarried twice, whose husband was grieving deeply. \u201cHe bought the pregnancy test. He saw that test emerge \u2014 he was drawn into it,\u201d Bueno said. He was already forging a relationship with the baby that he had to mourn, too.\n\nNearly five years after my loss, I don\u2019t think about the miscarriage much anymore. I was lucky to have a second child, which is what I desperately wanted, and that helped me. But lots of families still feel complicated grief even after having additional children. Bueno lost twin girls, Florence and Matilda, at 22 weeks, and she had three miscarriages as well. She went on to have two boys, and for her, \u201cthe nourishment and joy runs alongside the grief.\u201d Bueno told me about an oral history she had read from a woman with nine children. That woman had a miscarriage, too, and though she was in her 80s at the time of the oral history, she still felt the loss acutely despite her sizable brood.\n\nIf you know someone who has experienced a loss, Bueno said, \u201cerr on the side of compassionate curiosity.\u201d This could mean saying you\u2019re sorry for a loss, and then asking something open-ended, like, \u201cTell me what it meant to you,\u201d as it allows for the many kinds of emotion someone might feel. Be prepared for any response \u2014 a woman may not want to talk about it at all, or she may want to talk about the gory viscera. I recall making extremely dark jokes about what came out of me in the aftermath. Those physical side effects, \u201cthat stuff needs to be talked about,\u201d Bueno said. Otherwise we run the risk of women feeling \u201cicky and shameful and abnormal\u201d about what they\u2019ve experienced.\n\nWe need to make cultural space for every single kind of reaction to loss \u2014 there will always be a gamut of responses. And sharing these stories is a good place to start.", "description": "There\u2019s no \u2018normal\u2019 way to feel after a pregnancy loss.", "authors": ["Jessica Grose"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/multimedia/Parenting-02-nl-pregloss/Parenting-02-nl-pregloss-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
