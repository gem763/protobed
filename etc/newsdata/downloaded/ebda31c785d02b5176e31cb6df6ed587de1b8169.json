The 1950 house is being sold as-is but was reduced from $392,500. (Claudia Keller)\n\nThe concept of a \u201cstarter home\u201d \u2014 one that first-time buyers would purchase to begin building home equity \u2014 is not always popular in an area where even starter homes are priced in the $300,000s. Some buyers prefer to wait and save until they can afford a \u201cforever home\u201d rather than buy a first home, sell it in a few years and move up.\n\nFor buyers who want to start with something smaller or more affordable, a 744-square-foot single-family house is available at 10920 Oakwood Dr. in Fairfax City for $379,500. The house initially was priced at $392,500. Annual property taxes are $3,613. There are no homeowner association dues to pay.\n\nThe median sales price in July in Fairfax City was $509,000, according to Bright MLS, so this house is substantially below the median for the area.\n\n[Three-bedroom, four-bathroom townhouse in Fairfax County, Va., lists for $390,000]\n\nBuilt in 1950, the two-bedroom, one-bathroom house is being sold as-is, which means that buyers won\u2019t be able to negotiate based on the condition of the property. However, buyers can request an informational home inspection. The house includes a stacked washer and dryer, a dishwasher, refrigerator and stove, but the kitchen could use upgrading.\n\nThe living room has hardwood flooring and the bedrooms are carpeted. Air conditioning is supplied by window units and ceiling fans, and the house has natural-gas heat and hot water.\n\nTo build equity faster and therefore increase the profits of a future sale, buyers may wish to consider adding a second floor or doing some other type of expansion. The backyard has space for an addition and includes a deck, a detached one-car garage and a shed.\n\nAssigned schools include Providence Elementary, Lanier Middle and Fairfax High. The elementary school is rated below average by GreatSchools.org, the middle school is rated average and the high school is rated above average.\n\nFor more photos, click here.\n\nFor more information, contact Claudia Keller, a real estate agent with Century 21 Redwood Realty, at 703-431-5407.", "description": "AFFORDABLE HOME OF THE WEEK | The house has only 744 square feet.
