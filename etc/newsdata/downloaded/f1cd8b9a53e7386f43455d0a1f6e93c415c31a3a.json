It is 12 weeks this Saturday. I am in prime physical condition. I have agreed the date with the company,\" McGregor said, adding that he knows his opponent's name but won't reveal it. \"If I was to give you people the name, which I would love to do, I know the UFC would flip it because they are a crafty company.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old McGregor hasn't fought since losing by submission to Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018. He was banned for six months and fined $50,000 for his part in a post-fight brawl.\n\nMcGregor said he is targeting two more fights, including a rematch with Nurmagomedov in Moscow. He also aimed a string of insults at the Russian fighter.", "description": "The Irish fighter said Thursday he will return \"fully focused\" on Jan. 18 at the T-Mobile Arena.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103568282-GettyImages-512090068.jpg?v=1529471323", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
