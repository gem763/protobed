Did Hannity try to kneecap you?\u201d\n\nIn response, Maddow joked that \u201cyou oughta see the other guy\u201d before revealing the real answer: \u201cI just fell down, that\u2019s all it is. I\u2019m an old person now and when you fall down you break three ligaments and an avulsion fracture.\u201d\n\nOf course, before they could get to Blowout, her latest book about the oil and gas industry, Colbert had to ask his guest for her take on the Trump impeachment story. As \u201cAmerica\u2019s premiere explainer,\u201d he wanted to know if she was \u201cat all frustrated that the present scandal is so damn simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even sleuth your way through it,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cBecause in order to find out that Trump called Ukraine, what we had to do was ask Trump, \u2018Did you call Ukraine?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes, here\u2019s the evidence.\u2019\u201d She added, \u201cIn terms of \u2018whodunit,\u2019 he did it and he admits it and now he\u2019s going to be impeached for it.\u201d\n\nIf Maddow is correct, Trump would be the fourth president to be impeached by the House, but as she also noted, no president has been removed from office by the Senate.\n\n\u201cI think part of what is important now and what I\u2019m enthused about in terms of people being so into it, is we really know nothing about what\u2019s going to happen once he gets impeached,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think he\u2019s going to be impeached, but what is the result of that politically? What does it do to the two parties? What does it do for the next election? We have no idea.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u201chas been perfectly willing to say, \u2018Senate? What Senate?\u2019 whenever there is something he doesn\u2019t want them to engage with\u201d\u2014like Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court\u2014Maddow was oddly hopeful that this could all end with Trump being removed from office.\n\n\u201cI do think that this behavior by the president is so simple and it\u2019s so indefensible\u2014you can\u2019t go to another country and ask them for help against your likely opponent in the next election, you just can\u2019t,\u201d Maddow said, \u201cit may be that Republicans decide, either to save their own skins or because of their conscience or their patriotism, that they want to be on the right side of history on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I don't think they\u2019re deciding now,\u201d she added. \u201cI think they\u2019ll decide as it plays out.\u201d", "description": "The MSNBC host was oddly hopeful about Republicans in the Senate wanting to be \u201con the right side of history.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_154/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569991802/115849_0214_fxd6s2"}
