Several countries that are similar in economic size or standing to South Korea such as Singapore, Brazil and Taiwan have said they would not demand special treatment as developing nations.\"Countries with developing nation status at the WTO are given special treatment such as longer transition periods for implementing trade agreements and technical assistance.South Korea joined the WTO in 1995 as a developing nation and has maintained its developing country status in the areas of agriculture and climate change to allow it to provide subsidies for farmers and impose higher tariffs on agricultural imports.In July, President Trump accused 11 countries that are among the world's richest economies, including South Korea, Singapore and China, of abusing the developing nation status.He said that the U.S. would stop treating such countries as developing nations should the WTO fail to make substantial progress within 90 days, which was October 23rd.So far, Singapore, Brazil, Taiwan and the UAE have announced that they would give up developing nation status.The finance minister said South Korea won't be given special treatment as a WTO developing nation in future trade agreements but there won't be any changes to previously signed trade deals.He added the government will do everything it can to protect sensitive agricultural areas like rice and allocate an increased budget of 13 billion U.S. dollars for the agricultural industry next year.Kim Hyesung, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
