But now other critics now worry the agency is overcorrecting, putting drugs in patients\u2019 hands that may end up being unsafe or ineffective.\n\nMany accelerated-approval drugs launch with sky-high prices, even though they're not yet fully proven.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out the drug doesn't work in the end, nobody gets their money back,\" said Walid Gellad, a professor at the University of Pittsburg who studies the drug industry.\n\nSo far, that hasn't happened often. Lartruvo was only the second time in recent memory that an accelerated approval ended up going bust.\n\nBut the sharp jump in accelerated approvals is relatively recent; many of those drugs simply haven't finished their fuller clinical trials yet.\n\nPrices are also rising. Gellad cited several big-ticket drugs approved through the faster pathway, including Exondys 51, which treats a rare muscular disorder. It came onto the market based on a clinical trial of just 12 people \u2014 with price of roughly $300,000 per year.\n\nThe federal government disproportionately reaps both the costs and rewards of accelerated approval, Gellad explained in a recent paper.\n\nPrivate insurance plans can choose which drugs they'll cover, and can exclude drugs that haven't met the FDA's standards for full approval. That can deny patients early access to drugs that ultimately turn out to be life-savers; it can also spare them the cost of drugs that don't.\n\nBy law, though, Medicare and Medicaid have to cover almost every FDA-approved drug, and have only a limited ability to steer patients toward cheaper alternatives. (The Trump administration is trying to loosen those restrictions.)\n\nGellad has suggested a preliminary pricing structure to go along with preliminary approval.\n\nThe government could say, for example, that it will only cover manufacturing costs \"plus some agreed-on markup\u201d for accelerated-approval drugs.\n\nThat would give drugmakers an incentive to promptly follow through on the rest of their clinical trials and convert to a full FDA approval, he argues.\n\n\"If you look at it in the lens of paying for value: If there's no proof the drug has value, then why should we pay the same as if the drug had proof of value?\u201d he asked.", "description": "More drugs are available with less evidence and high price tags.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/jJYIG8B6_rdXXwYRo621zf-csCo=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/04/25/1556229351238.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-26"}
