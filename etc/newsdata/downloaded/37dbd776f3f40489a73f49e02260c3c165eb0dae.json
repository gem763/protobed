Here\u2019s how to make sure you\u2019re protected.\n\nRansomware is a particularly vicious type of malware that not only denies access to your computer system and data but demands a ransom be paid to unlock files.\n\nAnd the amount of ransom demanded keeps going up. A multimillion-dollar demand to an organization isn\u2019t unusual anymore.\n\nROBOCALL 'HIJACKING' IS ON THE RISE, REPORT WARNS\n\nRansomware typically spreads through phishing emails or by visiting an infected website.\n\nTurn on ransomware in Windows 10\n\nMicrosoft has a feature under Virus and Threat Protection that allows you to enable ransomware protection.\n\nHere\u2019s how to turn it on: Type in \u201cWindows Defender settings\u201d or \u201cWindows Security\u201d in the Windows 10 Cortana search bar (typically in the bottom lower left of the screen).\n\nSEXTORTION SCAMS ARE BACK, SECURITY EXPERT WARNS\n\nThen click on Virus and Protection settings and scroll down to \u201cRansomware protection\u201d and select that.\n\nNote that you may not be able to access Ransomware Protection if you have another third-party antivirus program running. Microsoft will warn you that you\u2019re using multiple antivirus programs and will recommend that you uninstall other antivirus programs if you want to enable Microsoft\u2019s Ransomware protection.\n\nAfter you\u2019re in Ransomware protection, toggle on Microsoft\u2019s \u201cVirus and Threat Protection.\u201d Then go to \u201cControlled Folder Access\u201d then \u201cProtect folders.\u201d This will protect files and folders you select from unauthorized changes.\n\nCHINESE CYBER HACKERS HAVE BUILT A BACKDOOR IN US-CHINA TRADE WAR, SAYS REPORT\n\nFor example, if you have Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft\u2019s file hosting service, you can turn on protection for the entire drive. Then you can recover files if they get encrypted by a ransomware attack.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to block suspicious software but if an app is blocked that you know is safe, you can build a white list. Use the Controlled Folder Access to whitelist apps. You can do this by going to \u201callow an app through Controlled folder access.\u201d\n\nAnother useful feature is \u201cBlock History\u201d that shows what\u2019s been blocked.\n\nTURN OFF YOUR BLUETOOTH, WARN SECURITY EXPERTS\n\nNote that access to Ransomware Protection settings may vary depending on your PC and what version of Windows 10 you\u2019re using.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd be warned: if you\u2019re not using a cloud-based file hosting service with automatic backup, you should make sure you\u2019re regularly backing up files so a ransomware attack doesn\u2019t lock you out of critical local programs and data on your PC.", "description": "Microsoft offers built-in ransomware protection for Windows 10.
