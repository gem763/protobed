But let\u2019s ponder upon the downside, considering everything they do becomes a public spectacle - be it dinner with a friend or the weekly Pilates session. Fans want to dig into the nitty-gritty of the off-screen lives of celebrities, and sometimes they just jump the gun and resort to sleazy stalking.\n\nHere are 6 celebrities who opened up about their borderline creepy stalkers:\n\n1. Chitrashi Rawat\n\nHow can we forget the unfiltered tomboy \u201cKomal Chautala\u201d from Chakde India! Recently, she became the victim of an extremely creepy stalker. As she explains, a couple of years back she checked into a Delhi hotel, and the series of events that followed were, simply put, disgusting. Right from her hotel room lights going out to creepy calls from the reception, stalking just hit a new low.\n\n2. Himika Bose\n\nHimika Bose rose to fame with the rib-tickling \u201cEvery Curly Haired Girl Ever\u201d and thought-provoking short films like Abnormal that gained millions of views. While she has a massive fan-following, there are some fans she could definitely do without. We are talking about this creepy stalker who knew EVERYTHING about her - right from what she was wearing, her taxi number, and her whereabouts.\n\nDo these stalkers have any idea how their actions mentally harass people?\n\n3. Anuja Joshi\n\nNow that\u2019s a story most of us can relate to. Relentless messages, calls and requests from the most random people. Can people understand the meaning of \u201cNO\u201d already!\n\n4. Nikita Dutta\n\nNikita Dutta, who last appeared in Kabir Singh, has also experienced the dark side of stalking. And her stalker was relentless, to say the least. Right from following her on her shoots (even if it means going to another country), checking into her hotel and taking the same flight as hers! This is downright creepy. What\u2019s more? This sleazy stalker first saw her at the gym, and that's where his obsession began.\n\n5. Parul Gulati\n\nNow this stalker took the techie-route, and started meddling with the apps on her phone. There were new and unknown applications on the phone, the screen recording icon was activated and she lost access to all of her pictures too. This is simply disgusting.\n\n6. Rashmi Agdekar\n\nA certain lady posted on her social media that she knows Rashmi Agdekar, and started contacting all of her friends too (now that\u2019s plain psychotic). What\u2019s worse? She somehow got Rashmi\u2019s phone number, and that\u2019s when the seamless and unwarranted calls and messages began. Rashmi eventually blocked her.\n\nA lot of us have been a victim of stalking as well - thanks to the creepy prank callers and the seamless Instagram requests. Bringing alive the gravity of this hideous \u201cstalking\u201d scenario, MX Player rolled out a psychological thriller, \u201cHello Mini\u201d, which will depict what exactly happens when a voiceless, nameless and faceless stranger intrudes in your life. The protagonist ends up on a dangerous path when her stalker's actions begin to affect her life gravely. Believe me, this is one series you\u2019ll be hooked on to! So grab a bucket of popcorn and stream all the 12 episodes of Hello Mini on MX Player, for free!", "description": "The perks of being a celebrity are countless - a glitzy life, oodles of   fan-following and big money.
