Kibet and Simiyu have not been allowed because they did not comply with the AIU anti-doping rules. We are now very strict with the compliance rules, we cannot make a mistake,\u201d Mutwii told reporters.\n\nAbout 60 Kenyan athletes have been sanctioned for anti-doping rule violations in the past five years. They include 2008 Olympic 1,500m champion Asbel Kiprop, 2016 Olympic marathon winner Jemimah Sumgong and former Boston and Chicago Marathon winner Rita Jeptoo.\n\nOfficials said Kenya would still be strong contenders in the men\u2019s 5,000m in Doha, with Kimeli among the world\u2019s fastest in the event this year, having run 12 minutes 57 seconds in June.\n\n\u201c(Nicholas) Kimeli is the strongest among Kenyans, despite his third placing at the trials,\u201d AK Council Member Barnaba Korir said.\n\nThe Kenyan team has suffered a number of setbacks in the lead up to the world championships.\n\nElijah Manangoi announced last week that he would not be defending his 1,500m title due to injury, while Jackline Wambui, who won the 800 metres at the Kenyan trials, and Linda Kageha, who was in the mixed relay team, withdrew after failing to take mandatory testosterone level tests.", "description": "Kenyan 5,000 metre runners Michael Kibet and Daniel Simiyu will not be allowed to compete at the athletics world championships in Doha after failing to meet anti-doping rule requirements, Athletics Kenya (AK) officials said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Isaack Omulo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
