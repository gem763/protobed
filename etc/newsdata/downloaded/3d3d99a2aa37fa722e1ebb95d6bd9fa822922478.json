(Al Drago/Reuters)\n\nDNC Chair Tom Perez was on Fox News Sunday over the weekend. Chris Wallace asked him about the Democrats\u2019 veer toward socialism:\n\nWALLACE: Whether it\u2019s the green new deal or Medicare for all or suggestions about very high tax rates on the super wealthy, how do you defend against President Trump\u2019s charge and effort to portray the Democratic Party, your tax and spend policies, as socialist? PEREZ: This is one of the oldest tricks in the playbook, Chris. You go back 75 years, when Republicans don\u2019t want to discuss the issues that matter to real people, they call it socialism. Social Security, when it was being debated, you had Republicans calling it socialism. The minimum wage in 1938, you had Republicans calling it socialism. Medicare, Ronald Reagan said, and I quote, Medicare will lead to socialized medicine. Medicare will lead to socialism in America. The Affordable Care Act. The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. All of those things were socialism, socialism. Why did they do that? Because they\u2019re wrong on the issues. They don\u2019t want to talk about pre-existing conditions. We\u2019re right on that issue. We want to make sure if you\u2019re diabetic you can keep your coverage. They don\u2019t want to. So they change the subject. And that\u2019s what they do . . .\n\nThis exchange caused me to yell at my TV. But I left it there. Then, last night on Special Report, Wallace was sitting in for Bret Baier and he brought up this clip and asked the panel about it. No one made what is to me the most obvious rejoinder in the world.\n\nIn the past, when Republicans accused Democrats of pursuing socialism, the Democrats denied it!\n\nThat\u2019s not what Democrats do anymore. In 2016, when Bernie Sanders was giving Hillary a run for her money talking up socialism, the then head of the DNC, steadfastly refused on multiple occasions to delineate a difference between socialism and the Democrat party. Since then, socialism has become only more fashionable among liberals and Democrats. AOC is a socialist. Various Democrats want socialized medicine. Etc.\n\nSo, what the Hell is Perez talking about? He\u2019s condemning Republicans for accusing Democrats of believing something Democrats increasingly confess to believe. How is that \u201cchanging the subject\u201d? That is the subject.\n\nOh and about Reagan\u2019s declaration that Medicare would lead to socialized medicine, I have some quibbles. The speech Perez and so many others refer to was given in 1961. Medicare wasn\u2019t passed until 1965 and didn\u2019t go into effect until 1966 \u2014 which is why Reagan didn\u2019t use the word Medicare once. It\u2019s a very small point because what Reagan was describing was the move toward something like Medicare.\n\nBut there\u2019s a larger point to be made: He was right! Or, at the very least, he had a point. Reagan warned that Medicare or something like Medicare will lead to socialized medicine. Today, Sanders, AOC, Gilibrand, et al are all demanding \u201cMedicare for All\u201d which \u2014 by their own words \u2014 is their own term for socialized medicine. Mocking Reagan for calling Medicare a stepping stone to socialized medicine while calling for socialized medicine under the banner of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d is a very strange rhetorical position.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
