After the miracle of Headingley and the miracle of Lord\u2019s, England found their miracle jar empty of all but a few late crumbs at Old Trafford.\n\nInstead, on a brisk, grey-green autumn day Australia successfully retained the Ashes by confirming what has been clear ever since the middle of the first Test at Edgbaston. Tim Paine\u2019s tourists are simply a more settled, more potent Test team, to a degree that miraculous individual performances can only disguise for so long.\n\nAustralia retain the Ashes after England fail to save fourth Test at Old Trafford Read more\n\nThere will now be a temptation to dwell on England failing to regain the Ashes; but in reality this has been an active feat. Australia have retained them, and done so by asserting some obvious strengths.\n\nTo the credit of England\u2019s batting lineup the final day was much more than the wake most had expected. Indeed it almost became a resurrection as the overs remaining ticked down past 30 with two wickets still to fall, as the air began to thicken and crackle, taking on that strange, animate fifth-day quality.\n\nAt times the entire kop end of the temporary stand writhed and bounced and waved its arms, taunting the approaching defeat. Jack Leach\u2019s appearance at the departure of Jofra Archer had been greeted like a triumph, a bonus, a masterstroke.\n\nLeach did his best. The twiddle, the hop, the neat little crouch. As the balls went by it was almost showy. At the other end Craig Overton seemed to have become something impregnable, 6ft 5in of impassible willow.\n\nAt which point, enter the cold, hard reality of a disintegrating pitch and a hard ball. Leach got one from Marnus Labuschagne that leapt. Overton was rapped on the pad by Josh Hazlewood. As the review confirmed the match had been won the Aussie huddle began to dance and leap and dissolve into a series of heartfelt embraces.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nAnd sporting justice was served here. All credit to the victors. Steve Smith has been busy producing his own summer of historical ascent, his own moon landing, his Woodstock. His performances will be talked about as long as people still care about Test cricket.\n\nAt Old Trafford Pat Cummins was again a marvel of sustained, high-pace craft, not to mention an Australian cricketer with the easy cinematic charm of a 1950s American matinee idol auditioning for the role of the world\u2019s most handsome astronaut.\n\nPaine deserves a separate round of applause: his team has been relentlessly orderly in the field; and almost to a man likable and good-humoured in the face of crowd hostility. Although there is a case to recalibrate just how intimidating the sight of 200 beer-sodden middle-aged men in emu suits really is, and to what degree this actually constitutes a \u201cfortress\u201d.\n\nIn the end the nation with the best pace attack in the world, the best finger spinner outside India and the double insurance of Him at No 4 has just been too strong for a Test team with one fit bowler in the ICC top 25 (Australia have four).\n\nPlus of course there is other mitigation. England\u2019s resources have been geared for the last three years towards white-ball cricket, with scheduling and decision-making at all levels geared towards winning the World Cup. It has been a commercial choice. And you can\u2019t, as England\u2019s cricketing history demonstrates so well, win \u2019em all.\n\nAnd yet, not so fast. There are still debts to be paid here, wrong turns to be picked over. England have clung on in a series they might have lost by now. But they should still be better than this.\n\nSelection has been muddled, and at times wilfully quirky, with too many empty holes and half\u2011filled roles. Jason Roy, Joe Denly, Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler have walked out to bat 32 times and scored three fifties between them. Why have they all played four Tests, the entire active lifespan of this series?\n\nPlay Video 2:42 Steve Smith the difference as Australia retain Ashes, say Root and Paine \u2013 video\n\nThe feeling of a lack of direction from the key centre of power, coach plus captain, has been tangible at times. England have picked 25 new players in the last three years. Plenty of good ones \u2013 Ben Foakes, Sam Curran, Dawid Malan \u2013 have been discarded for reasons that are often unclear. With Joe Root yet to suggest any real vision or authority as a captain this Test team would perhaps benefit from more direction than has been evident under the light-touch style of Trevor Bayliss.\n\nAustralia beat England in fourth Test to retain Ashes \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nA new coach will be hired after the Oval. It might be a good first act in the job to tell Bairstow that if he wants to be a Test player he has to knuckle down to batting in the middle order; and Buttler that if he wants to be in this team it\u2019s going to have to be on merit as a No 7 who keeps wicket. To his credit Root has led in this sense, moving up to No 3 and scrapping away through a rough patch of form.\n\nYet in many ways England\u2019s fate here is a minor issue. The England and Wales Cricket Board will view this series as a triumph in any case. Headingley put Test cricket on the front pages. Old Trafford was sold out on four days and almost full on the fifth. The coffers have rung, the product has been visible, even in defeat to a superior opponent.\n\nThis feels like the start of a new cycle. The lesson of the secondary, less triumphant half of the summer is that England would do well to take just a little more care of the oldest, most relentlessly gripping form.", "description": "Taking on the world\u2019s best pace attack and the genius of Steve Smith was always going to be tough after three years geared towards white-ball cricket and a home World Cup", "authors": ["Barney Ronay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75de925b4cc7501a76171c5dd2ea0ea47d0c7e20/0_166_4990_2994/master/4990.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=246604d7eec9c42fa9c4879da4c973af", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
