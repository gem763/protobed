Not only did money from payroll funds disappear, but so did money belonging to employees, according to the report from KrebsOnSecurity.\n\nHalf a dozen law enforcement vehicles embarked on the town of Edinburg, New York, near Saratoga Springs, around 4:30 p.m. local time, the Daily Mail reported, adding that the agents stayed for an hour.\n\nThe payroll company abandoned its Clifton Park offices, near Albany, in early September. The company alerted thousands of clients with a message saying it would be closing its virtual doors and that companies who relied on the firm to process payroll payments were instructed to find another means to provide such services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployees nationwide were left in the dark, some deep in the red with negative bank account balances.\n\n\"These businesses and workers deserve answers, and I am calling on the Department of Financial Services to investigate this irresponsible company's actions. This is not how we do business in New York, and we will not allow these bad actors to take money away from the hard-working people in this state.\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\n\nMyPayrollHR enlisted the services a third-party payroll processor, in this case, Cachet Financial Services, to pay their workers. Cachet is used to withdraw a sum from an employer's account. The money gets placed in a holding account to then be distributed by the clearinghouse into an employee's personal bank account.\n\nCachet said it is owed millions of dollars by MyPayrollHR; it facilitated payments to employee accounts for MyPayrollHR for the last 12 years.\n\nTwenty-six million dollars was supposed to be put into a holding account, but Cachet's general counsel Wendy Slavkin confirmed to FOX Business that didn't happen, adding that Cachet is responsible for all of the transactions that take place. Slavkin said the company had to turn to their own accounts in order to replenish the missing funds, instead of the money coming from the employer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The search late Monday follows the collapse and disappearance of MyPayrollHR.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/FBI-payroll-iStock-Gov.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
