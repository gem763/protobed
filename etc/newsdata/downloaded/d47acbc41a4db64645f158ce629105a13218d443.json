The realization that the symbolic landscape can either reinforce or contest racism is especially resonant at a time when cities, churches and schools are discarding Confederate names and iconography .", "description": "Vandals destroyed numerous signs remembering the 1955 lynching, mirroring the violence inflicted on the teenager himself.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/opinion/23brentWeb-03/23brentWeb-03-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
