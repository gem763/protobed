(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\n\nThe National League playoff chase \u2014 and the MVP race \u2014 just got an unfortunate shakeup.\n\nMilwaukee Brewers star Christian Yelich is out for the season with a fractured knee cap, the team announced Tuesday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nChristian Yelich left tonight\u2019s game with a fractured right knee cap. He will miss the remainder of the season. \u2014 Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 11, 2019\n\nYelich sustained the injury by hitting a foul ball off his knee during the first inning of the Brewers\u2019 game against the Miami Marlins. Yelich immediately fell to the ground, but eventually walked off the field on his own power.\n\nIt has not yet been decided if Yelich will need surgery, nor has a timetable to return been determined. He will fly back to Milwaukee on Wednesday for further testing.\n\nChristian Yelich was a top MVP candidate\n\nLosing Yelich is an enormous blow to Brewers, who currently find themselves 5.5 games back from the NL Central-leading Cardinals and 1.5 games back from the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild-card spot.\n\nAt the time of his injury, Yelich led the National League in both on-base percentage (.430) and slugging percentage (.672) and seemed to be only getting better as the season went on. He had recently become just the 10th player in MLB history to post 40 home runs (he\u2019s currently at 44) and 30 stolen bases in a season.\n\nYelich won the MVP award last year with a scorching hot second half, and he was set to compete with Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Cody Bellinger down the stretch for the same award this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nChristian Yelich will miss the rest of the season with a fractured kneecap.\n\n\n\nYelich's season OPS will finish at 1.100, the highest in a qualified season in Brewers history.\n\n\n\nHe also becomes the 2nd reigning MVP ever to record a 40-30 season. pic.twitter.com/7lRERD4m8z \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) September 11, 2019\n\nSince Yelich was acquired in a trade with the Marlins following the 2017 season, few players, if any, have been as important to their lineups as the 27-year-old has been to the Brewers.\n\n\u201cThis is a guy who has carried us in a number of ways over the last two years. Could have been two-and-a-half weeks from a repeat Most Valuable Player award.\u201d Brewers general manager David Stearns said to reporters. \u201cWe have a lot of guys in that clubhouse who will hurt tonight. This is a gut punch.\u201d\n\nWithout Yelich, the Brewers\u2019 season outlook seems bleak. Stearns pointed to another past injury, Jimmy Nelson\u2019s shoulder injury in 2017, as an example of an injury the team has to power through. The Brewers finished 86-76 that year, missing the playoffs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before as an organization,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cTwo years ago almost to the day, we lost Jimmy Nelson to a similarly freak injury. We competed at a very high level for the remainder of that season. I expect our team to compete at a similarly high level going forward.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Christian Yelich was looking to repeat as MVP.
