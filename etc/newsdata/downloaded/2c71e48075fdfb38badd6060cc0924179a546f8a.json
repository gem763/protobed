I was lucky!\n\nHummingbirds, native to the Americas, are the smallest of birds, most species measuring just 7.5-13 cm in length. They eat a variety of insects including mosquitoes and fruit flies, and drink nectar to supply their energy needs\n\n'I even had to make over three gallons of nectar to keep the feeders full!\n\n'A gentleman from a birding site in southern Texas estimated there were at least 200, and possibly as many as 300 birds!\n\n'The charm was thick like that for 12 hours, from 7 in the morning until sunset!'\n\nHummingbirds, native to the Americas, are the smallest of birds, most species measuring just 7.5-13 cm in length.\n\nThey eat a variety of insects including mosquitoes and fruit flies, and drink nectar to supply their energy needs.\n\n'I even had to make over three gallons of nectar to keep the feeders full! Christy said\n\nMost North American hummingbirds fly southwards in autumn to spend winter in Mexico, the Caribbean Islands, or Central America.\n\nChristy said south Texas is 'very popular with birders because we get such a wide variety of birds, not just hummingbirds, during migration'.\n\nShe said that she's even had 'large numbers of Orioles' flying by too.\n\n'Had I known about them in advance, I'd have picked up my good camera instead!'
