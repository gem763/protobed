His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!\u201d\n\nThe death of Cummings, a respected lawmaker known for his civil rights advocacy and for improving conditions in his Baltimore district, was met with sorrow on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nCummings died overnight from medical complications linked to longstanding health issues, his office announced. He was 68.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called him a \u201ctowering character ... whose stirring voice and steadfast values pushed the congress and country to rise always to a higher purpose\u201d, and ordered flags be flown at half-mast in the Capitol, with the same tribute paid at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe will miss our champion,\u201d Ms Pelosi, a native of Cummings\u2019 Baltimore, said in her statement.\n\nIt was one of many acts by prominent politicians in tribute to Cummings, the son of a sharecropper who rose to become the chairman of the House of Representatives oversight committee.\n\n\u201cOur nation has lost a mighty fighter for democracy, accountability, equity and justice with the tragic loss of congressman Elijah Cummings,\u201d wrote Stacey Abrams, a prominent figure in the Democratic Party. \u201cHe never forgot that his was borrowed power, which he wielded in defence of the vulnerable and on behalf of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heart is broken, as I weep personally and for his family and community,\u201d congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democratic member of the committee, said. \u201cElijah Cummings\u2019 unmatched integrity and leadership leaves a remarkable legacy.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows, a Republican member of the committee who frequently sparred with Cummings, said: \u201cThere was no stronger advocate and no better friend than Elijah Cummings. I am heartbroken for his wonderful family and staff \u2013 please pray for them. I will miss him dearly.\u201c\n\nThere was praise too from Democratic presidential candidates, with senator Cory Booker calling him a \u201ctrue leader\u201d, former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke remembering a \u201cfighter for justice\u201d, senator Kamala Harris labelling him a political \u201cgiant\u201d, and former vice president Joe Biden calling him a \u201ctrue public servant\u201d.\n\nCummings had become a key figure in the investigations into Mr Trump, including the proposed addition of a citizenship question to the US Census, the use of private email addresses by White House employees and treatment of migrants at the US-Mexico border.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments came when Cummings grilled Mr Trump\u2019s personal attorney Michael Cohen in February.\n\nThe president\u2019s daughter and White House advisor, Ivanka Trump, also praised Cummings, despite the congressman having issued subpoenas for her White House correspondent to determine whether she broke the law in using a private email for public work.\n\n\u201cElijah Cummings was a dedicated and courageous public servant. A son of sharecroppers, he tirelessly championed his community and country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMay God comfort his loved ones and may he Rest In Peace.\u201d\n\nCummings\u2019 died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate in Maryland.\n\nRead more\n\nDemocrat at centre of Trump impeachment probe dies\n\nElijah Cummings urges Trump to visit Baltimore after racist insults\n\nTrump goads black congressman about his home being burgled: \u2018Too bad!\u2019\n\nTrump renews attack on black congressman Elijah Cummings", "description": "Donald Trump has paid tribute to Elijah Cummings, who died suddenly on Thursday, praising the Democratic congressman for his \u201cstrength, passion and wisdom\u201d just months after describing his Baltimore district as \u201crat infested\u201d and taunting him over a break in at his home.\u201cMy warmest condolences to the", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TWT7ApCkrcVLURTeSM1QdQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/4593b83e014212136a4b66089c912cf4", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
