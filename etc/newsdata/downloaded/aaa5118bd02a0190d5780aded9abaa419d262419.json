And then it was as if the goal scared us, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. That needs to change because if we go into leads then it should be a positive not a negative.\n\n\u201c(I\u2019m annoyed with) everything. My own performance, what I did and what the rest of the lads did.\n\n\u201cWe believed we could have been the team to compete with them and now they\u2019re six points clear.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be hard to get back but we need to try and unfortunately we have Belgium at home because there\u2019s now no other option than to get a result.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get a result on Monday, I think it\u2019s going to be verging on impossible to get through this group.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s best hopes of qualifying for next year\u2019s finals appear to be via the Nations League playoffs, with a semi-final place already secured.\n\nRobertson said he understood why supporters were staying away from games, with just 32,433 at the 52,000-capacity Hampden Park. Nearly 21,000 more fans turned up for Scotland\u2019s final rugby union World Cup warm-up in Edinburgh on Friday.", "description": "Scotland captain Andy Robertson delivered a withering verdict on their 2-1 Euro 2020 qualifying defeat by Russia on Friday which he said was one of the most disappointing of his career.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427276355&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860LU", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
