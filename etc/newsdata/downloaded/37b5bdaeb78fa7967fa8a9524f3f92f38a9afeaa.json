There are two battlefronts: One is the negotiation to eliminate the barriers to American companies competing in China, and the other is what to do about Huawei, China\u2019s enormous telecom networking company that Beijing sees as a crown jewel of national innovation and the Trump team sees as a giant global espionage device.\n\nGet to know that name \u2014 Huawei. The issues it represents are as important as all the rest of the trade talks combined.\n\nOn the pure trade battlefront, I left China feeling that there\u2019s a decent chance a limited deal \u2014 rolling back some American tariffs in exchange for a resumption of certain Chinese purchases, particularly of agricultural products, from the United States \u2014 can be reached in the near term. Both sides could use such a deal.\n\nI also left feeling, though, that President Xi Jinping is less likely to sign on to the kind of grand bargain, and broad concessions, that President Trump is demanding. That\u2019s in part because Xi would get too much pushback from his state-owned industries and Communist Party hard-liners. But it\u2019s also because months of impulsive Trump threats, tariffs, praises and then more threats have clearly led a lot of Chinese officials to conclude that Trump is an unstable character who always has to be seen to \u201cwin\u201d and humiliate the other side, and therefore can\u2019t be counted on for a big win-win deal \u2014 or even to stick to it if one were agreed on. Better to let the talks drag on.", "description": "During a rare interview, the company\u2019s chief executive proposed negotiations with the Justice Department.", "authors": ["Thomas L.
