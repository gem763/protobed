However, other Western officials and major financers of Ukraine's government also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because he was seen as a barrier to anti-corruption efforts.\n\nWhat is the impeachment inquiry?\n\nA Democratic-led inquiry is trying to establish whether Mr Trump withheld nearly $400m (\u00a3327m) in aid to nudge Ukraine's newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky into launching an inquiry into Joe Biden and his son.\n\nIn a phone call on 25 July, Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky for help on the issue.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims\n\nA whistleblower raised concerns about the phone call, prompting the launch of a formal impeachment investigation last month.\n\nThe White House this month sent an eight-page letter to top Democrat and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling the inquiry \"constitutionally invalid\" and therefore stating that President Trump would not be co-operating.", "description": "The move by the son of former US Vice-President Joe Biden follows attacks by President Donald Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/23C9/production/_109216190_2ea17021-8762-4af8-87f8-28f404ec2727.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
