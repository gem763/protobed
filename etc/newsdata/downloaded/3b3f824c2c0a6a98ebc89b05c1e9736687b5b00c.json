Brown is accused of exposing himself and kissing the woman without permission during one training session in June 2017, and then ejaculated on the woman during a second encounter at Brown\u2019s home later that month, according to court documents obtained by FOX Business.\n\nThe woman ended her business relationship with Brown following the second incident, but relented after Brown apologized and agreed to train him again. During a third encounter in May of 2018, Brown allegedly overpowered and \u201cforcibly raped\u201d the woman, the documents said.\n\n\u201cAs a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision,\u201d Brown\u2019s accuser said in a statement obtained by the New York Times. \u201cI have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter and on the web site HeitnerLegal.com, Brown's lawyer Darren Heitner said Brown \"denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit\" and promised the NFL star would \"pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false accusations.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown's accuser is seeking compensatory and punitive damages against the nine-year NFL veteran for his \"brutal and sadistic misconduct,\" the suit said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed just days after the Patriots signed Brown to a one-year contract worth up to $15 million. The deal included $10 million guaranteed and a $9 million signing bonus.\n\n\"We are aware of the civil lawsuit that was filed earlier today against Antonio Brown, as well as the response by Antonio's representatives,\" the Patriots said in a statement. \"We take these allegations very seriously. Under no circumstances does this organization condone sexual violence or assault.\"\n\nThe NFL informed the Patriots that it will investigate the situation, the team added.\n\nThe Oakland Raiders released Brown from his contract last week after a series of disputes with team management over his conduct during training camp. One report said Brown threatened to punch Raiders General Manager Mike Mayock in face.\n\nThe NFL did not immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 request for comment on the situation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "The lawsuit alleges that Brown forced himself on the woman during three encounters in June 2017 and May 2018.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Antonio-Brown.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
