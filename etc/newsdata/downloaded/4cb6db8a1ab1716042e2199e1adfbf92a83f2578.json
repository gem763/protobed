Unscrew the lid! Tilt it above a glass, which you\u2019ve likely had to retrieve from a cupboard!\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make you need a drink.\n\nBut thank the alcohol gods, for now there\u2019s a solution: whisky cocktails in capsules. Like Tide Pods, but actually intended to be consumed.\n\nWhy, you may ask?\n\nWe truly cannot answer that. It doesn\u2019t appear that people have been on their knees begging for such a creation.\n\nAnd yet Speyside distillery The Glenlivet has swooped in to offer their Capsule Collection, which they describe as \u2018glassless cocktails\u2019.\n\nWe define glassless cocktails as just taking a swill straight from the bottle, but potato, potato.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe capsules do have a purpose, even if it is a bit muddy. They\u2019re meant to be better for the environment, as rather than having booze packaged in glass bottles, the capsules hold 23ml of whisky in a casing made from seaweed extract.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou just shove the whole thing in your mouth, bite, enjoy that mouthful of whisky, then swallow the fully biodegradable capsule. If you don\u2019t fancy swallowing a bit of seaweed stuff, you can just chuck it in your compost.\n\nThe Glenlivet partnered with Tay\u0113r + Elementary to come up with three different capsule cocktails, themed around the three flavours of citrus, wood, and spice. Then they worked with Notpla to create a sustainable packaging option \u2013 the capsules.\n\nThe capsules are going to be served at Tay\u0113r + Elementary throughout London Cocktail Week. Presumably once you\u2019ve scarfed down a couple you can then enjoy a normal cocktail in a glass; one that doesn\u2019t require you to hold what appears to be quite a large shot of booze in your mouth in one go. Some of us like to sip.\n\nThe reaction to the poppable capsules has been\u2026 mixed.\n\nSome have compared the cocktails to jello shots while others are making the inevitable Tide Pod challenge references. Many have gently let Glenlivet know that if you make little capsules of booze, someone will put one in their butt. This is likely to be the case.\n\nMORE: Quiz: How well do you know classic cocktails?\n\nMORE: A self-service cocktail bar has launched in London\n\nMORE: The heatwave cocktail guide: London bartenders advise what to drink\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Yes, these whisky capsules are basically the grownup version of the Tide Pod challenge.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88462544_1570267485.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
