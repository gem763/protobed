And I fought a referendum and I was told I was definitely going to win, and I lost.\n\n'Strangely enough, I still look at opinion polls.\n\n'The trouble with general elections is you're asking one question, but people may easily go and vote on any number of other questions.\n\n'I think that's what happened in 2017.'\n\nMr Cameron added he backed the current Prime Minister's attempts to secure a deal with Brussels and take it through the Commons.\n\nHe said: 'The answer I suspect is now compromise on both sides.\n\n'Boris is compromising and I suspect may have to move a bit more. And the EU should compromise too.'\n\nThe pair discussed aspects of Mr Cameron's book For The Record, extracts of which were recently published in the Times and Sunday Times.\n\nMr Cameron said he regretted not fighting harder to demand caps on EU immigration, and said German Chancellor Angela Merkel always accused him of wanting 'extra wurst' in his attempts to negotiate deals for Britain.\n\nHe also revealed that when he was exhausted on board Air Force One, former US president Barack Obama 'tucked me in' to his own bed on the aircraft, saying: 'I bet Roosevelt never did this for Churchill.\n\nAmid increasingly bitter clashes with Brussels, the PM and his Cabinet - including Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured) - are meeting to consider whether anything can be done to break the deadlock\n\nCommons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg and Housing Minister Esther McVey arriving in Downing Street this morning\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab arriving for the Cabinet meeting\n\nBoris Johnson was today gathering his forces for an all-out battle with the EU and Remainer MPs as aides admitted Brexit talks are set to break down dramatically this week.\n\nAmid increasingly bitter clashes with Brussels, the PM and his Cabinet are meeting to consider whether anything can be done to break the deadlock.\n\nBut furious Downing Street sources have painted a grim picture of the consequences of rejecting the UK's 'fair and reasonable' blueprint.\n\nOne has explosively claimed the government will make clear that any EU country supporting a delay to the October 31 Brexit deadline would be engaging in 'hostile interference' in British politics.\n\nAny hope of cooperation will be 'in the toilet' and the Tories will end all negotiations to fight an election, switching to a policy of leaving the EU immediately with No Deal.\n\nThe Tories will win because Parliament and Remainer MPs are 'as popular as the Clap'.\n\n'They think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals,' the source told the Spectator. 'This won't happen. We'll either leave with No Deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with No Deal.'\n\nThe brutal assault - which former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd claimed came from maverick No10 aide Dominic Cummings - emerged after Mr Johnson's proposals hit a huge roadblock.\n\nEU politicians have branded them a 'joke' and Emmanuel Macron setting a deadline of Friday for the UK to make more concessions.\n\nThe prospects of getting a deal for a crunch Brussels summit next week now appear to be close to zero.", "description": "The ex-Tory leader, who quite after leading the failed Remain campaign in 2016, said he did not know if his successor could remain in power if the UK does not leave the EU on October 31.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/19435172-0-image-a-18_1570526476978.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
