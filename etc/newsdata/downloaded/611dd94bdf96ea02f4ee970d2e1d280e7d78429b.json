Previously he ran communications for the SEC and for the Carlyle Group. He\u2019s whistled in powerful circles, too, including a performance for George W. Bush in the Oval Office.\n\nAs a performer and advocate for the art, Ullman has perhaps done more to make whistling sexy than anyone since Lauren Bacall. Unfortunately, he says, the word \u201cwhistle\u201d itself increasingly has negative connotation even among those who enjoy his music.\n\nTerms like \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d and particularly \u201cdog whistle,\u201d often used to convey thinly veiled racism, have somewhat tarnished the whistle\u2019s good name, he said.\n\n\u201cIt has terrible connotations,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, serious whistlers are so desperate for any public recognition we will take whatever we can. We still struggle for legitimacy.\u201d\n\nThis is a far cry from whistling\u2019s earlier portrayals in pop culture. \u201cWhen you get in trouble and you don\u2019t know right from wrong, give a little whistle,\u201d Jiminy Cricket sang to Pinocchio.\n\n\u201cJust whistle while you work, and cheerfully together we can tidy up the place,\u201d Snow White added.\n\nOther pro whistlers say their art can withstand the current usage of the word. \u201cI only wish my form of \u2018whistleblowing\u2019 was as impactful and important as the work that these brave whistleblowers have been doing,\u201d Molly Lewis said. \u201cThey give whistling a good name. They are the true heroes of whistling. I encourage everyone to whistleblow.\u201d\n\n(For those interested in hearing whistleblowers in action, Ullman is performing Sept. 29 in Delaware with the Newark Symphony Orchestra).", "description": "Until last week, Chris Ullman \u2014 a four-time international whistling champion \u2014 was Washington\u2019s most famous whistleblower.", "authors": ["Jeremy Olshan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS243_ullman_ZG_20190927140015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
