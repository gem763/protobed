It\u2019d be faster to run through the A-listers who didn\u2019t release an album last year than the ones who did. Does that mean that they\u2019re tapped out and the same thing won\u2019t happen this year? Of course not! We\u2019ve already seen highlights from Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Solange, Vampire Weekend, Tyler, the Creator, Bruce Springsteen, Bad Bunny and J Balvin, Charli XCX, the Highwomen, and many others. The big themes of the year are still hard to pinpoint, but we can say with certainty that the albums below confront complicated emotions in complicated times. It might not be a new concept, but it\u2019s a welcome one.\n\nAmerican Football, American Football (LP3)\n\nWith LP3, emo godfathers American Football have officially been more fruitful since their 2014 reunion than they were in their late-\u201990s heyday. The impossible trick is that they\u2019ve maintained the same level of quality. American Football slowed down and mellowed out, but prettier melodies and longer running times don\u2019t make these songs any less gutting than AF 1.0 gems like \u201cNever Meant\u201d and \u201cHonestly?\u201d LP3 is not above new tricks. Guest vocalists Hayley Williams, Elizabeth Powell, and Rachel Goswell invite textures that complement lead singer Mike Kinsella\u2019s voice while opening up possibilities for future collaborations.\n\nAriana Grande, Thank U, Next\n\nAriana Grande\u2019s second album in just six months is somehow sharper, sadder, and more personal than the last. Recorded in a two-week stretch a few months after the release of last summer\u2019s dewy, happy Sweetener, this year\u2019s Thank U, Next is an end cap to the last album\u2019s romanticism and a rejoinder to the idea that happiness is the game of sharing life with a lover. Thank U sees Grande and A-list pop producers Max Martin, Pop Wansel, and Ilya Salmanzadeh process the year of stress and pain the singer endured after the Manchester Arena bombing, the loss of her ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, and her breakup with the actor Pete Davidson. The beats are a mix of spacious R&B/trap hybrids, airy ballads, and careful excursions into rock and reggae. Burned out but far from broken, a new pop supreme emerges.\n\nBad Bunny and J Balvin, Oasis\n\nOasis, a mini-album mind meld between Puerto Rican Latin trap performer Bad Bunny and Colombian reggaet\u00f3nero J Balvin (and their go-to producers), is the rare moment where the clear frontrunner for the party album of the summer drops out of the sky just in time for talk of vacations and cookouts to kick off. Oasis feels perfectly engineered for the moment where June melts into July, and everyone starts to look a little cuter through a haze of heat and humidity. Bunny and Balvin process their own feelings of lust and longing while graciously providing a soundtrack for everyone else doing the same in the next few months.\n\nBaroness, Gold and Grey\n\nSinger, multi-instrumentalist, and artist John Dyer Baizley\u2019s rock quartet Baroness continues to evolve on Gold and Grey, the fifth in a color-coded series of sludge metal and hard rock wonders including the heady Red Album and Blue Record as well as the genre-hopping double album Yellow and Green. The new album traces an unpredictable path through white-knuckle radio-rock riffs, slow-burning dirges, porchfront folk tunes, and airy, ambient palette cleansers. Just when you think this band has run out of tricks to pull and hues to tap for an album concept, it returns and achieves the impossible one more time.\n\nBillie Eilish, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\n\nWe talk a lot about genres crashing into each other and creating new forms over the last decade of tastes expanding online, but When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, the debut album by 17-year-old singer, songwriter, and producer Billie Eilish, is the idea in action. The music, written and produced by Eilish and her brother Finneas, stacks and rearranges aspects of rap, dance music, folk, rock, pop, and show tunes into hybridized, colorful forms, like Legos. Zipping through the album\u2019s baker\u2019s dozen of two- and three-minute wonders, you come away with an appreciation of Eilish\u2019s formidable chops as a writer and performer and an excitement for where she\u2019ll take them next.\n\nBlood Orange, Angel\u2019s Pulse\n\nIf you\u2019re the type that powers through the haze of the dog days with music that sounds the way the end of summer feels, dig Angel\u2019s Pulse, where globe-trotting, genre-hopping studio whiz Blood Orange checks in with his first commercial mixtape, a travelogue of the places he\u2019s been and the people he\u2019s met since last year\u2019s studio album. Like a great playlist on shuffle, Pulse is both effortless and lawless in its mixture of trap, soul, rock, and gospel values, the kind of place where Arca, Tinashe, Toro y Moi, and members of Three 6 Mafia drop in, and everyone sounds cool and natural together.\n\nBon Iver, i,i\n\nMost music about environmentalism is either impossibly fun or cloyingly serious, with little middle ground. On one end, you have, say, Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cBig Yellow Taxi,\u201d and on the other, there\u2019s Imagine Dragons\u2019 \u201cRadioactive.\u201d Bon Iver\u2019s i,i is rife with message songs that don\u2019t carry the bleakness of their message like a stone. The lyrics are heavy on close inspection, but the music makes them buoyant. You don\u2019t catch the withering political commentary of a song like \u201cHey, Ma\u201d unless you listen past the hip-hop phrasings and production flourishes. \u201cNaeem\u201d couches sophisticated sadness in Migos triplets. The album gets brutal when it sits still. \u201cU (Man Like)\u201d delivers stern words about American homelessness through a chorus of voices, including Moses Sumney\u2019s and Bruce Hornsby\u2019s. The feeling is quite like getting dressed down in a parent-teacher conference. i,i otherwise resists this kind of directness. It\u2019s too in love with balancing rustic acoustic sounds with electronic textures to allow itself to be a drag.\n\nBrittany Howard, Jaime\n\nAlabama Shakes and Thunderbitch singer-songwriter Brittany Howard\u2019s debut solo album Jaime is a tour de force; like a cross-country road trip, it weaves through scathing rock tunes, stately folk ones, lithe funk workouts, and upbeat soul scorchers. Howard\u2019s ecstatic vocals, expressive guitar, and crisp drums light the way, with assists from jazz-funk legend Robert Glasper, Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell, and gifted session stickman Nate Smith. Jaime is both a break from the Shakes\u2019 hearty southern rock influences and a refinement of the songwriting engine powering them.\n\nBroken Social Scene, Let\u2019s Try the After (Vol. 1 & 2)\n\nThe two-month gap between the first and second installments of veteran Canadian indie-rock collective Broken Social Scene\u2019s Let\u2019s Try the After EP series is the shortest layover between BSS projects ever. (Usually, we\u2019re lucky to see two in a decade.) As it turns out, 20-minute installments suit the band well. Sprawl\u2019s their thing, but short, quiet songs offer convincing evidence that a band whose finest moments are five- to seven-minute guitar jousts can be just as impactful in a wistful three-minute love song.\n\nBruce Springsteen, Western Stars\n\nSixty-nine-year-old Asbury Park institution Bruce Springsteen\u2019s nineteenth career full-length sees the troubadour diving into the minds of a gallery of old timers lamenting the idea that their ship has sailed, from the jilted, out-of-work songwriter of \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d to the injured daredevil of \u201cDrive Fast (The Stuntman).\u201d It is in these stories of broken men settling down that the Boss locates a second wind of his own. Western Stars is Springsteen\u2019s best (and by no coincidence, his quietest) album in over a decade, proof positive that try as you might, you can\u2019t keep a good dog down.\n\nCharli XCX, Charli\n\nCharli XCX is so ahead of her time that she called her last mixtape Pop 2, thumbing her nose at the radio faves who\u2019ve been retracing her steps since 2013\u2019s True Romance. This fall\u2019s Charli crystallizes what makes the U.K. singer great. She\u2019s an honest writer, a gifted vocalist, and a thoughtful collaborator; no one else would think to corral Lizzo, Haim, Cupcakke, Clairo, Sky Ferreira, Christine and the Queens, and Big Freedia for the same album, and few possess the range to bring them together in a cohesive body of work that sounds both futuristic and fun.\n\nFlying Lotus, Flamagra\n\nFlying Lotus albums feel like hovercraft rides through uncharted territories in space, but album six, this spring\u2019s star-studded Flamagra, seems to be very poignantly inspired by the producer and director\u2019s hometown of Los Angeles. Its jazzy, airy grooves evoke West Coast hip-hop even when they\u2019re aiming far beyond it; its meditation on fire as an agent of change and destruction can only have come from someone who steps outside from time to time to see the hills ablaze. It\u2019s a testament to the artist\u2019s sensibilities that none of this comes out feeling overbearing. At the root of it all, he just wants to get people dancing.\n\nFreddie Gibbs and Madlib, Bandana\n\nFive years after the Midwest-SoCal duo of Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs and Los Angeles producer Madlib teamed up to crack skulls on their debut collaborative album, Pi\u00f1ata, the pair regroups with the stunning Bandana. Gibbs\u2019s bars race with the triumph of a gifted technician whose future seemed uncertain at various frightening low points in the last few years, and Madlib\u2019s beats make soul funk, rock, and reggae sounds bend to his will like Magneto. Guests Anderson .Paak, Pusha-T, Yasiin Bey, Black Thought, and Killer Mike appear like a consort of magi converging on the scene of a historical event.\n\nFuture, The Wizrd\n\nFuture\u2019s career is a stark study of contrasts; he\u2019s a rapper and a singer, a trap star and a balladeer, a writer of infectious love songs and scathing breakup records. 2017\u2019s Future and Hndrxx split the Atlanta performer\u2019s creative instincts down the middle, the one album playing out like an action movie while the second cheesed about the finer points of companionship and cohabitation. January\u2019s The Wizrd restores the balance. Wizrd\u2019s 20 tracks ping-pong between gruff street talk and vulnerable discussions of matters of the heart. The result is a picture of a complicated man, a balance between toughness and tenderness. It\u2019s versatile in subject matter but also in form. The new songs contain a few of the artist\u2019s best raps and tightest melodies. Fifteen years into his rap career, Future\u2019s still finding ways to grow.\n\nGirlpool, What Chaos Is Imaginary\n\nOn album No. 3, this winter\u2019s What Chaos Is Imaginary, Los Angeles indie singer-songwriter duo Girlpool sharpens its nostalgic alt-rock to a fine point. The twee folk style that informed the outfit\u2019s first two full lengths, 2015\u2019s Before the World Was Big and 2017\u2019s Powerplant, has been reined in significantly; in its place, there are big guitars, unforgettable hooks, and plaintive, honest vocals from singer and guitarist Cleo Tucker alongside singer and bassist Harmony Tividad. Squint and you\u2019ll feel like you tripped and fell into the Matador vaults. What Chaos Is Imaginary makes the familiar sound sublime and rejuvenating.\n\nThe Highwomen, The Highwomen\n\nInspired by the \u201980s supergroup comprising country legends Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson, the Highwomen \u2014 a quartet uniting ace country singer-songwriters Amanda Shires, Maren Morris, Brandi Carlile, and Natalie Hemby \u2014 pooled their tremendous skills on September\u2019s excellent self-titled debut. The wealth of experiences each singer brings to the table gives The Highwomen impressive range; there\u2019s songs about raising families and about being single, about loving a man and loving a woman, about being young and feeling old. This group contains multitudes.\n\nJenny Lewis, On the Line\n\nFormer Rilo Kiley lead singer Jenny Lewis\u2019s fourth album under her own name, On the Line is a milestone in a career that\u2019s been building since her days starring in \u201980s sitcoms and kids\u2019 movies. The new songs brim with the wisdom of a performer who, at just 43, has accumulated over 30 years of Hollywood and music industry experience. Lewis sings of crumbling lives and coming doom in a hearty, moving voice, while her backing band \u2014 which at different points in the album includes Beck, Ryan Adams, and members of the Beatles, Tom Petty\u2019s Heartbreakers, and John Lennon\u2019s Plastic Ono Band \u2014 provides foundational roots, rock grit, and performances that beam with as much heart as their singer does.\n\nJustin Townes Earle, The Saint of Lost Causes\n\nSinger-songwriter Justin Townes Earle \u2014 thusly named as the son of the country troubadour Steve Earle, who named his kid in part after his friend, the late Townes Van Zandt \u2014 has spent the last decade crafting elegant, folky dispatches about his experiences as a New Yorker. But this spring\u2019s The Saint of Lost Causes turns the lens outward, illuminating the struggles of a network of realistic characters in dire straits, to dazzling effect. Spacious, haunting arrangements make it an essential soundtrack to late-night reflection.\n\nThe Mountain Goats, In League With Dragons\n\nNorth Carolina indie-folk trio the Mountain Goats continues a decade-long streak of stunning concept albums about fanatics, geeks, and outcasts with In League With Dragons, a song cycle obsessed with murder mysteries and tabletop gaming. Songs like \u201cDoc Gooden\u201d and \u201cWaylon Jennings Live!\u201d compare athletes and performers in their twilight to wizards losing touch with magic. \u201cYounger\u201d and \u201cClemency for the Wizard King\u201d humanize foot soldiers in a mythical war. Aiding head Mountain Goat John Darnielle\u2019s thoughtful pen and emotive vocal is the delicate, airy accompaniment of bassist Peter Hughes and drummer Jon Wurster, and production from singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Owen Pallett.\n\nSay Anything, Oliver Appropriate\n\nWhether you read it as a series of character sketches about a serial killer or a string of gorgeous acoustic campfire songs from an artist whose bread and butter is loud guitars and intricate arrangements or a nostalgic look back on the themes of a beloved album years later, Say Anything\u2019s Oliver Appropriate stuns. The new music muses about what happened to the protagonist of the West Coast emo act\u2019s breakthrough album \u2026 Is a Real Boy, a baker\u2019s dozen of wry observations about punk culture and masculinity, after the limelight fades. Oliver Appropriate\u2019s story of bottled same-sex attraction and physical violence is a salty, bitingly funny, and ultimately tragic examination of what happens when people don\u2019t get what they want in a world gone wrong \u2026 but the lyrics are just abstract enough to be enjoyed without thinking about any of that stuff, if that\u2019s your thing.\n\nSlipknot, We Are Not Your Kind\n\nMetal\u2019s masked marauders Slipknot spent the last two albums trying to reconcile its goth-rock tendencies with its taste for blunt-force power-metal grooves, skewing heavy on 2008\u2019s All Hope Is Gone and leaning toward lighter textures on 2014\u2019s .5: The Gray Chapter. On this summer\u2019s We Are Not Your Kind, balance is restored. It features the band\u2019s most assured songwriting since 2004\u2019s Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses. A song like \u201cNero Forte\u201d captures the dynamic; the verse is harsh, but the chorus nudges it imperceptibly to sweetness. All Hope fans will appreciate the vicious \u201cBirth of the Cruel\u201d; Gray Chapter gang will latch on to slow burners like \u201cSpiders\u201d and \u201cMy Pain.\u201d Twenty years on from their self-titled debut, the band continues to find ways to reinvent and rediscover itself.\n\nSolange, When I Get Home\n\nWhen Solange Knowles sings, \u201cI saw things I imagined\u201d at the start of her fourth studio album \u2014 and first visual album \u2014 it\u2019s not clear right away what the lyric refers to. As the stoned, dreamy When I Get Home unfurls, you learn that the thing she\u2019s imagining is her hometown, Houston, Texas. Through a series of short songs, sketches, and shamanistic chants set to music, Solange shares her dream of home through feelings, sounds, and abstract phrasings rather than rehashing the powerful, declarative lyricism of her 2016 statement A Seat at the Table. Home is more fractured and offbeat than its predecessor, but the music\u2019s mix of jazz fusion methodologies and DJ Screw pacing feels like a peek into the future.\n\nSturgill Simpson, Sound and Fury\n\nKentucky country-rock crooner Sturgill Simpson is a big dreamer. His 2014 breakthrough Metamodern Sounds in Country Music recast classic outlaw country in a druggy, psychedelic haze, and 2016\u2019s sprawling A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth supplied his newborn son with advice about growing up. Sound and Fury ups the ante: it\u2019s a self-described \u201csleazy synth-rock dance record\u201d with an accompanying anime. Both the film and the album wisely synthesize seminal post-apocalyptic wasteland anime and the peppy soundtracks that propel them. If you ever wondered what ZZ Top might sound like covering the Cure, or Queens of the Stone Age doubling down on those latent Gary Numan vibes, this is your album.\n\nTaylor Swift, Lover\n\nTaylor Swift loves to trick the audience with her singles. The cloying \u201cME!\u201d and the bratty, nonchalant \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d were ruses of a sort. They got us thinking she would stretch even further out into the passive-aggressive post-genre maximalism of Reputation, when really, she was angling at a mix of sleek synth-pop love songs spiced with country ballads in the same manner as Red. Lover is fun and effortless in ways it takes repeat listens to unpack; people always look to songwriters to process big trauma through art, but Taylor Swift is more in her wheelhouse examining the tiny pleasures of companionship here than she was on Rep, which was, in spite of its lovely, quiet moments, a lot like a professional wrestling promo. Lover sees Rep\u2019s budding romance blossom, and luxuriates coolly among the flowers.\n\nThom Yorke, Anima\n\nFor a taste of Radiohead and Atoms for Peace figurehead Thom Yorke\u2019s gobstopping dynamic range as a writer and performer, drop the needle down on his new album Anima\u2019s \u201cTwist\u201d and let it play through to \u201cDawn Chorus.\u201d On the former, he crafts heady, ominous electronic music out of unusual rhythmic and melodic elements before blowing the composition to bits with a wave of synths that swallow the song. On the latter, he embraces a coming reckoning in an exhausted, disembodied whisper, keyboard figures stuttering to a stop underneath each measure like a last missive from the drowning seaman in the \u201cNo Surprises\u201d video. Anima spends its remaining 30 minutes landing even stranger creative stunts.\n\nToro y Moi, Outer Peace\n\nSinger, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Chaz Bundick\u2019s shiftless solo project Toro y Moi has carried him from wispy, nostalgic dance pop to Kinks-style rock and back in the last decade, but this year\u2019s Outer Peace finds a new direction, as the South Carolina star pours his talents into a string of laid-back tunes inspired by trap and R&B hybridizers like Drake and Travis Scott. There\u2019s still room for big dance moves \u2014 see \u201cFreelance\u201d and \u201cOrdinary Pleasure\u201d \u2014 but killer cuts like \u201cNew House\u201d and \u201cBaby Drive It Down\u201d push Toro y Moi the closest to radio accessibility the act has been since Underneath the Pine.\n\nTyler, the Creator, IGOR\n\nLike a villain in a monster movie, IGOR sneaks up on you. The sweetness of the hooks and arrangements make the first taste land like marshmallow cr\u00e8me, but repeat plays reveal new textures in the confections. Tyler used to be a menace, but now he\u2019s making songs about crushes and head rushes. He used to be a snarling rapper, but now he\u2019s an R&B vocalist making giddy love albums. Watching him work through what bugged him up till now has been a rocky ride; IGOR is the beach-house vacation at the end of the trip.\n\nVampire Weekend, Father of the Bride\n\nKeeping Vampire Weekend alive beyond the hiatus and personnel changes the band has experienced since the release of 2013\u2019s Modern Vampires of the City meant radically restructuring the idea. Front man Ezra Koenig picked up a few tips watching Kanye West work a few years back. This spring\u2019s Father of the Bride draws from a wide constellation of collaborators, including members of Haim, the Internet, and the Dirty Projectors. The result is a kaleidoscopic array of pop-rock nuggets about the state of love and trust, guided by Ezra\u2019s voice and sensibilities and enriched by samples and session players from across the spectrum.", "description": "Including standout work from Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Bruce Springsteen, Bad Bunny and J Balvin, Tyler, the Creator, Vampire Weekend, Billie Eilish, Future, and more.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/03/03-best-albums-sept-new.w1200.h630.jpg"}
