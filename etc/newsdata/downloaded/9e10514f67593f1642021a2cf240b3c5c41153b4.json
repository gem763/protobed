The Sinner producer hilariously paid tribute to her husband\u2019s peak boy band years when the couple attended the Casamigos Halloween party in Beverly Hills on Friday night. So, suffice it to say, \u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Be Me\u201d likely has new meaning for JT.\n\nTimberlake obviously didn\u2019t mind being immortalized in costume by his wife, since he played along with his own ensemble. Photos show Biel really leaning into her husband\u2019s \u2018NSYNC persona in a metallic \u201990s-esque jumpsuit, white sneakers, diamond earrings, round sunglasses and, naturally, Timberlake\u2019s trademark bleached curls. For his part, Timberlake \u2014 one of the iconic boy band\u2019s lead vocalists from 1995 until 2002 \u2014 went as a giant microphone to coordinate with his wife\u2019s tongue-in-cheek costume. It didn\u2019t stop there, though. The fun-loving couple went all in with the theme, having recruited four male friends to dress up as the other members of \u2018NSYNC.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nThe bash, which was hosted by Cindy Crawford and husband Rande Gerber, was reportedly a huge success. Biel and Timberlake\u2019s entire \u201cband\u201d partied on the dance floor into the wee hours, a source told People.\n\nJessica Biel and Justin Timberlake were also at the 2019 Casamigos Halloween Party. She dressed up as Timberlake (alongside friends, as the rest of *NSYNC) while Timberlake was a microphone (which she, presumably, dropped).

On The Tonight Show\u2018s Tuesday episode, the late-night host pulled up a 1999 interview in which Biel was asked whether she was a fan of Timberlake\u2019s then super-group.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really listen. I mean, I know of them, of course, and I\u2019ve heard of them and I\u2019ve heard the music,\u201d she said in the throwback clip, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think I own any of their CDs. I\u2019m not a huge fan. But, I mean, cool, I guess.\u201d After watching, Biel couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her teenage attitude. She playfully told Fallon, \u201cI am so screwed now.\u201d\n\nPerhaps her costume was penance? Whatever the case may be, Biel and Timberlake clearly don\u2019t take themselves too seriously.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
