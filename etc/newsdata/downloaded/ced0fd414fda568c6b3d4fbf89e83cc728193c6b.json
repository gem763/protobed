It was the kind of first movie that made you excited to see where he might go next, successful enough to suggest that better things were waiting around the corner. With his follow-up, the darkly comic drama Bad Education, he\u2019s stepped up in terms of scale and ambition, telling a fact-based story of a brazen high school embezzlement with a starrier cast at his disposal. But like his first film, it\u2019s the work of someone still finding their footing, a few degrees away from something worth truly shouting about.\n\nJojo Rabbit review \u2013 Scarlett Johansson lifts smug Hitler comedy Read more\n\nLike three other films also showing at this year\u2019s Toronto film festival, it\u2019s based on a long-read feature, a growing trend that often pushes unusual, under-reported stories even further into the spotlight. The case at the centre of Bad Education is a classic example, a scandal that might have gained traction locally but remains unknown to many. It\u2019s 2002 and Frank Tassone (Hugh Jackman), a much-loved school superintendent, is determined to push Long Island\u2019s Roslyn high to the top of the area rankings and has helped push for the construction of an elaborate \u201csky walk\u201d to help boost the school\u2019s image. Rachel (Geraldine Viswanathan), an eager student reporter, is assembling what she calls a \u201cpuff piece\u201d for the school paper about the plans but after interviewing both Frank and his assistant superintendent for business, Pam Gluckin (Allison Janney), she discovers that there\u2019s something afoot.\n\nFor a long stretch of Bad Education, we\u2019re not really sure where the film is going or even what the film is, whether we\u2019re in darkly comic Election territory or something more straightforward and dramatic. At times, I wasn\u2019t entirely convinced that Finley and the screenwriter, Mike Makowsky, were sure either, with a shagginess that borders on aimlessness, but their decision to skate so close to banality slowly pays off. We\u2019re invested in the district\u2019s dull bureaucracy as the thread starts to unravel, and it unravels in often un-cinematic ways, as does life. What\u2019s most refreshing is how the pair avoid turning their characters into grotesque caricatures, something that a less humane film would have easily done. The wrongdoers, whose slow, increasingly unhinged, theft of school funds gets revealed, are closer to pathetic than evil.\n\nWhile it\u2019s never exactly dull watching Janney repeat her quippy, alcohol-soaked, Oscar- and Emmy-winning shtick, it\u2019s a relief to see her dialled down here. She\u2019s wonderfully restrained and utterly credible playing a woman whose only real motivation was wanting more from life, and Makowsky avoids the need to justify or excuse her behaviour. There\u2019s also a strong turn from Viswanathan as the student whose reporting uncovered the depths of corruption, and her character is presented in an equally plain manner: she\u2019s plucky without being Nancy Drew and with this and the Sundance hit Hala, her star is definitely on the rise. But the film\u2019s real ace is a never-better Jackman, following up an underrated turn in last year\u2019s The Front Runner with another difficult and inscrutable protagonist. It\u2019s fascinating character work for reasons it would be unfair for me to reveal (even though it\u2019s easily Google-able) but there are hidden, tragic depths and it\u2019s one of the best performances we\u2019ve ever seen from him as he appears to be thriving in a challenging and thrilling new phase of his career.\n\nMakowsky shows us how people attempt to justify their own bad behaviour when they don\u2019t think of themselves as bad people. There\u2019s an unspoken arrogance often attached with working in a system that\u2019s ultimately helping others to succeed, and in the film it acts as a weak defence of amorality, as if they\u2019re somehow owed something. It\u2019s a slight movie at times, unfocused at others, even plodding in parts, and I didn\u2019t leave the cinema entirely convinced that it was the most satisfying way to tell this particular story but I did leave feeling confident in both Jackman\u2019s prowess and Finley\u2019s promise, yet to be fully realised.", "description": "A fascinating central turn proves the most interesting ingredient in a shaggy retelling of a high school corruption scandal", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/541c34c5e62d657f52a17cdc1fa27e66be739fae/106_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c6754475768decf33a093f14068cbaca", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
