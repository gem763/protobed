That process is referred to in the title of Farrow\u2019s book.\n\nAccording to Farrow, Dylan Howard, then editor of the Enquirer, ordered a staffer to \u201cget everything out of the safe\u201d and said \u201cwe need to get a shredder down there\u201d.\n\nFarrow writes: \u201cThe staffer opened the safe, removed a set of documents, and tried to wrest it shut. Later, reporters would discuss the safe like it was the warehouse where they stored the Ark of the Covenant in Indiana Jones, but it was small and cheap and old.\u201d\n\nFarrow quotes an employee of the Enquirer as saying \u201ca larger than customary volume of refuse\u201d was collected from the Enquirer offices later the same day.\n\nHe also quotes a \u201csenior AMI employee\u201d as saying: \u201cWe are always at the edge of what\u2019s legally permissible. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nOn CNN on Monday morning, Farrow said the safe contained details of alleged consensual affairs and payoffs and also allegations of assault by Jill Harth, who in a 1997 complaint accused Trump of \u201cattempted \u2018rape\u2019\u201d. In October 2016, amid a flood of allegations of sexual misconduct by Trump, she stood by that allegation in an interview with the Guardian.\n\nThe Enquirer endorsed Trump and published negative stories about his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nFarrow\u2019s claims were reported before the book\u2019s publication by outlets including Politico, CNN and the Daily Beast.\n\nAn attorney for Howard said in a statement the former editor would not comment, \u201cwhile all legal options and jurisdictions are being considered\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for American Media said in a statement: \u201cMr Farrow\u2019s narrative is driven by unsubstantiated allegations from questionable sources and while these stories may be dramatic, they are completely untrue.\u201d\n\nCatch and Kill has also sparked intense controversy over its coverage of sexual assault allegations against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and NBC host Matt Lauer, which both men deny.\n\nThe day I confronted Harvey Weinstein: \u2018He said, \"You think you can save everyone\"\u2019 Read more\n\nThe book is the subject of legal threats around the world but still went on sale on Tuesday.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian published last weekend, Farrow said the factchecking process had been so rigorous, one factchecker \u201cgot a stress nosebleed\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let the reporting in the book stand on its own,\u201d Farrow told CNN.\n\nFarrow writes that the safe which held the Trump material belonged to Barry Levine, then executive editor of the Enquirer. Levine is now co-author, with Monique el-Faizy, of the forthcoming book All the President\u2019s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator.\n\nAn excerpt of that book published in Esquire last week said 43 women were making new allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by Trump.", "description": "Shredding allegedly took place in first week of December 2016 but publisher American Media calls story \u2018completely untrue\u2019", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb7c56c29f7a2157ea36cd68a84620b4166456e0/0_64_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5095587afc53d0bcb8658ea91a7e7d47", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
