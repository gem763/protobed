Even if we find it very unlikely because the brain injury is devastating,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Specialists at the Royal London Hospital believe Tafida Raqeeb has no chance of recovery\n\nAt a press conference, Mrs Begum thanked the hospital for \"believing in my daughter's recovery\".\n\n\"I visited Tafida this morning, she is stable, she was awake, fully awake, turning her head from side to side,\" she said\n\n\"I am feeling emotionally drained. I think I will burst into tears very soon.\"\n\nShe added: \"I just believe that since Tafida is in Italy it will be wise for her to have Italian citizenship.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Tafida was transferred by air ambulance via Genoa's Cristoforo Colombo airport\n\nMrs Begum said the family was crowdfunding for Tafida's treatment but added it had sponsors in place and the money \"should not run out\".\n\nUK specialists had previously argued any further treatment of Tafida, who suffered a brain haemorrhage, would be futile.\n\nBosses at Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Whitechapel, had said ending Tafida's life support was in her best interests.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Fergus Walsh, BBC health correspondent in Genoa\n\nThe treatment in Genoa is centred on keeping Tafida alive.\n\nBut doctors here say although Tafida has suffered devastating brain damage they cannot rule out some small spontaneous recovery in the months ahead.\n\nDr Andrea Moscatelli denied his team was giving Tafida's parents false hope.\n\nThe Genoa medical team told the High Court they did not foresee any therapies that might improve Tafida's neurological condition.\n\nBut doctors now intend to give Tafida a tracheostomy - meaning she'll have a tube inserted in her windpipe, connected to a ventilator - which will hopefully allow her to be cared for at home by her parents.\n\nTafida - deemed by the High Court to have minimal awareness and being unable to feel pain - has a sleep-wake cycle and opens and closes her eyes.\n\nDoctors in London had argued it was near-impossible for Tafida to derive any benefit from continued life and she should be allowed the \"dignity of dying peacefully\".\n\nTafida's parents, both practising Muslims, argued Islamic law said only God could take the decision to end her life.\n\nThe High Court ruled on 3 October there was no justification to stop the child being taken abroad.", "description": "Hospital bosses in the UK had tried to block attempts to move Tafida Raqeeb to the hospital in Genoa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DA11/production/_109252855_hi057332431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
