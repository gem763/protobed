This morning my husband Craig went to the tip and two amazing human beings trawled through hundreds of bags to find it.\n\n\"Their kindness and good hearts have had me in tears.\"\n\nImage copyright Monmouthshire council Image caption Not far off trying to find a needle in a haystack\n\n\"I don't normally wear it - it's too big,\" she said.\n\n\"I've lost 10 stone since I had it and haven't worn it for a long time. It was at my mother's for years, but she gave it back to me a few months ago.\"\n\nIt had been kept on an old candle in her bathroom, and when she threw that out, the ring went with it.\n\n\"In the evening it dawned on me. I said to my husband 'Oh my God, it's in the candle, I've binned the candle',\" she added.\n\n\"By the time I realised, the tip had shut. My husband called last night and they said they couldn't promise but to show up in the morning.\n\n\"In all honesty I didn't think they'd find it, I spent most of the evening crying.\"\n\nImage copyright Monmouthshire council Image caption After four hours, the workmen, Rhys and Darren, found the ring\n\nHowever, Mr Carter and workers Rhys and Darren were determined.\n\n\"Craig knew which bag it was in because it had all the things from the bathroom cupboard,\" Mrs Carter said.\n\n\"When they found that bag they carefully put all the contents out.\"\n\nMr and Mrs Carter thanked the workers, saying it showed the Monmouthshire community \"at its best\".\n\nThe couple bought the workers a box of beer each, a \u00a325 food voucher and a \u00a310 scratchcard.\n\nAs for the ring, Mrs Carter said: \"I'm going to give it back to my mum - she's more sensible.\"", "description": "Two refuse centre workers trawl through hundreds of bags to find a woman's missing ring.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7E19/production/_109218223_ring.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
