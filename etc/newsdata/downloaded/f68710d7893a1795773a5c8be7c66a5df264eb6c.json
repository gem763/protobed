(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThere was a time when Donald Trump was relatively indifferent to Ukraine. During an interview with NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd in the summer of 2015, Todd asked Trump whether the European country should join NATO.\n\n\u201cIf it goes in, great,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go in, great.\"\n\nTrump, then a newly minted front-runner in the Republican nominating contest, wasn\u2019t worried about the geopolitics of Ukraine.\n\nOnce he won the presidency, though, that changed. Ukraine has become a repeated and obvious political playing card for Trump over the past several years, in part because of its oppositional role to Russia. When questions about Russia have arisen, Trump and his allies have often tried to redirect America\u2019s gaze to Ukraine.\n\nThe most recent example remains murky, the focus of a complaint from a whistleblower within the intelligence community, according to Washington Post reporting. Even that still-unclear allegation probably loops back to a very public, very loud assertion from Trump and his team \u2014 a loudness that they now seem to hope will aid them tactically.\n\n\u201cJohn Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.\u201d @seanhannity @FoxNews \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2019\n\nThe earliest iteration was an effort to wave away questions about Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election by suggesting that Ukraine was engaged in something equivalent. It was a line of argument that leveraged a January 2017 article from Politico, describing how a consultant working for the Democratic National Committee had sought information from Ukrainian officials largely centered on Paul Manafort, previously a political consultant in that country but at the time Trump\u2019s campaign chairman.\n\nWhen news broke about Donald Trump Jr.'s having embraced an offer of dirt on Hillary Clinton that he believed came from the Russian government, the incident with the DNC contractor was lifted up as a counterpoint. Trump Jr.'s only media interview in the immediate aftermath of the revelation of the Trump Tower meeting was with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u2014 who opened his show by walking through the DNC-Ukraine story in his own loaded, spottily accurate way.\n\nWhere this particular look-at-Ukraine effort fails is largely in scale. What\u2019s alleged is that one contractor \u2014 who stopped working with the DNC in July \u2014 worked with staff at the Ukrainian embassy to examine Manafort\u2019s record. Such research wasn\u2019t part of her role with the party, and there\u2019s no evidence that the DNC was broadly aware of her efforts. There\u2019s no evidence that the Ukrainian government was actively engaged in a large effort to aid the Democrats or Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. By contrast, U.S. intelligence officials uncovered evidence that Russia was trying to aid Trump at the highest levels \u2014 and was actively doing so in various ways.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like big stuff, very interesting with Ukraine. I just spoke with the new president a while ago, and congratulated him. ... But that sounds like big, big stuff, and I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d \u2014 Trump, to Hannity earlier this year\n\nEarlier this year, the idea that Ukraine had interfered in a Russia-like way expanded outward in a new direction. Manafort\u2019s tenure with Trump\u2019s campaign ended after a Ukrainian politician publicized what he claimed were documents maintaining an account of secret payments from a Russia-linked political party to Manafort. Trump was already battered by questions about his ties to Russia; the report of the secret ledger crystallized his desire to dump Manafort from his team.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Manafort worked for the party at issue. There have been questions raised about the legitimacy of the ledger itself, though the Associated Press has confirmed one of the payments it documents.\n\nLast year, the Ukrainian government concluded that two officials \u2014 a member of parliament and the head of the anti-corruption bureau \u2014 had violated the law by publicizing Manafort\u2019s name. That action was criticized as amounting to interference in the U.S. presidential election and thereby \u201charm[ing] the interests of Ukraine as a state.\u201d It was not, however, evidence of an orchestrated attempt to help Clinton \u2014 or even obviously untrue.\n\nSpeaking to Hannity earlier this year, Trump claimed that this development amounted to \u201cbig, big stuff.\u201d In a rambling interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on Thursday night, Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani similarly evoked the incident as being problematic.\n\n\u201cI was investigating, going back to last year, complaints that the Ukrainian people, several people in Ukraine, knew about a tremendous amount of collusion between Ukrainian officials, and Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee,\u201d Giuliani claimed, \u201cincluding a completely fraudulent document that was produced, in order to begin the investigation of Manafort.\"\n\nThis was an inaccurate summary of the allegations above. Giuliani's broader claims to Cuomo centered on what might be involved in the whistleblower complaint.\n\nWhile investigating what happened in Ukraine, Giuliani claimed, \u201cI found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the President of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son.\u201d This, Giuliani said, was \u201can astounding scandal, of major proportions\u201d being covered up by the media.\n\n\u201cLook at Joe Biden \u2026 he calls them and says, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare prosecute. If you don\u2019t fire this prosecutor\u2019 \u2014 the prosecutor was after his son \u2014 then he said, \u2018If you fire the prosecutor, you\u2019ll be okay. And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u2019 or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?\u201d \u2014 Trump on Fox News in May\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been covered up by the media. Trump himself tweeted out a New York Times report outlining the allegations. It just hasn\u2019t gained much traction, for understandable reasons.\n\nThe allegation is that in March 2016, Biden, then vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless the country fired its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Shokin had been accused of not cracking down on corruption, and the Ukrainian parliament voted him out of office soon after.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s allegation of bribery centers on Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who at the time served on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. That oligarch and the company, Burisma, may have been under investigation by Shokin at the time of his firing. That\u2019s the line Giuliani draws: investigation tangentially related to Hunter Biden, ergo Joe Biden wants investigator fired.\n\nExcept, as with so many of Giuliani's claims, that's not a fair presentation of what happened.\n\nAs our fact-checkers have explained, Shokin had been under scrutiny for a long time for his failures to crack down on corruption, and not just by Biden or the United States. There\u2019s no indication that the push to dump Shokin originated from Biden; it instead apparently came from staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev. An anti-corruption activist in Ukraine told the Intercept that Shokin \u201cwas fired because he attacked the reformers within the prosecutor general\u2019s office, reformers who tried to investigate corrupt prosecutors.\u201d\n\nIn short, then, there\u2019s a dearth of evidence that Biden decided that Shokin had to go in order to protect his son, or that the company for which his son worked was under investigation or that his son was involved in aspects of the company that would have been investigated. In fact, Shokin\u2019s ouster led to the appointment of a prosecutor who ended up opening an investigation into Burisma, anyway (though this, too, is complicated).\n\nGiuliani\u2019s effort to find evidence bolstering his case attracted attention at the time, raising questions about the willingness of Trump\u2019s team to leverage international relationships to his own electoral benefit. A Fox News poll released on Wednesday shows Trump trailing Biden by 14 points in a hypothetical general-election matchup; uncovering a bribery scandal would presumably help Trump regain some ground.\n\nBut, then, this is precisely what Trump was accused of having done in 2016: seeking political aid from a foreign country. Here, such an effort was occurring to some extent in the open.\n\nPerhaps not entirely, however. While the thrust of the whistleblower complaint remains unclear, Giuliani seemed to suggest to Cuomo that it might involve Trump\u2019s demanding that Ukraine focus on \u201ccorruption,\u201d which, in Giuliani\u2019s explanation centered on this Biden interaction. There\u2019s speculation that Trump might have withheld aid to Ukraine in part to compel the country to conduct this \u201ccorruption\u201d investigation \u2014 speculation that comes from people including U.S. senators.\n\nOne theory is that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to dig into the Biden claims in a phone call earlier this year.\n\nNB: The Ukrainian readout of the presidential phone call says explicitly Trump tied investigations & improving relations between the two countries, specifying completing \u201cinvestigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u201d \u2014 Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) September 20, 2019\n\nHere is where the loudness of the allegations is useful to Trump. If the whistleblower complaint does allege that Trump demanded Ukraine in essence bolster his political efforts in exchange for aid, Giuliani\u2019s very public and very energetic discussion of that push in the context of \u201cfighting corruption\u201d has preset a narrative among Trump\u2019s supporters. It would then have been a dually useful effort on Giuliani: smearing Biden and inoculating Trump\u2019s base.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump insisted that he would not have said anything untoward to a foreign leader on a call that he knew was being monitored. Perhaps that\u2019s true in the abstract, but he and his allies have been very open and very public in hinting about how events in Ukraine can aid the president politically. That he might have crossed a line in private seems less unlikely in that context.\n\nThe White House press corps asked Trump about the whistleblower allegation in the Oval Office on Friday morning.\n\n\u201cAsked whether he discussed Biden in this conversation, [Trump said,] \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed,\u2019 \u201d The Post\u2019s Seung Min Kim reports, \u201cand says \u2018someone ought to look into Joe Biden.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSafe to say that Trump is no longer indifferent to Ukrainian politics.", "description": "To that end, Giuliani's odd CNN appearance may have been quite helpful to Trump \u2014 at least over the short term.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zJkBtOuVD9Tk9mR5H2-PfRzoPhA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4NXIFYCVZ4I6PBALKEQCMMM5U4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
