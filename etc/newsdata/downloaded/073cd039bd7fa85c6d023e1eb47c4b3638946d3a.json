(6888.KU) rose Wednesday, with investors taking advantage of the stock's dive following the failed merger with a unit of Norway's Telenor ASA (TEL.OS).\n\nShares of Axiata--Malaysia's largest telecom company by market capitalization--ended the morning trading session 2.4% higher at MYR4.21, making it one of the top gainers on the local bourse. Shares of Telenor's Malaysian unit, DiGi.com (6947.KU), were down 0.2% at MYR4.59.\n\nAxiata and Telenor had in May announced that they were discussing a possible noncash merger of their Asian telecom and infrastructure assets that would have created one of Asia's largest telecom companies with potential annual revenue of $12 billion. On Friday, they said the deal was off. Axiata shares slipped almost 16% Tuesday, the first day of trading following that news with markets in Malaysia closed on Monday due to a public holiday.\n\n\"We believe the steep decline in Axiata's share price has largely priced in investors' disappointment on the termination of the Axiata-Telenor merger discussion,\" Kuala Lumpur-based Affin Hwang Capital said in a research note.\n\nThe investment bank upgraded Axiata, which is majority-owned by Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd., to a hold rating from sell, with an unchanged target price of MYR4.25, citing stronger-than-expected overseas earnings and possible mergers and acquisitions.\n\nWrite to Yantoultra Ngui at yantoultra.ngui@wsj.com.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 11, 2019 02:22 ET (06:22 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
