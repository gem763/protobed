He also became the first vice-president to speak at the openly anti-LGBT Family Research Council\u2019s annual conference in 2018.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s White House correspondent, Justin Sink, pointed out on Twitter that J\u00f3hannesson had been wearing a rainbow bracelet in pictures showing him shaking Pence\u2019s hand.
