Islander slept with \"106 people\"", "language": "en", "text": "Love Island Australia is known for its raunchy games.\n\nAnd on Wednesday night, model Matthew Zukowski, 24, confessed to sleeping with 106 people during the second season's first challenge.\n\nDuring the 'Excess Baggage' game, he confessed to keeping count of his sexual conquests in his iPhone's note section to the shock of his 'girlfriend' Vanessa Sierra.\n\n'Why would you keep tabs?' Love Island Australia's Vanessa slams model Matthew after he reveals he's had 106 SEXUAL PARTNERS during racy game\n\n'Why would you keep tabs of exactly how many people you've slept with? Every time you f**k someone you change the number?' she questioned, clearly uneasy by his candid admission.\n\nDuring the game, contestants read out a racy confession from a member of the opposite sex and were told to kiss the person they believed it belonged to.\n\nVanessa , who is paired with Matt, got the confessional card and discussed it with the girls before prancing over to kiss Matt.\n\n'Did you think it was me?' he said indignantly, before Vanessa replied: 'I didn't think it was you. They thought it was you.'\n\nGood guess! Vanessa Sierra (pictured), who is paired with Matt, got the confessional card and discussed it with the girls before prancing over to kiss him\n\nIt was then revealed he was the owner of the secret, as he laughed while his co-stars stood in disbelief at the huge number.\n\n'So I was 13 years old and I lost it there,' he said, slightly embarrassed.\n\n'Not sure after again and then again and again and again and again. Then again and again and again. Then again. For 106 times,' he added.\n\nA shocked Vanessa went on to ask how he kept count, with the bed-hopping lothario revealing he kept the sizable number in his phone.\n\n'Is it names as well?' Vanessa asked, before Matt replied: 'They don't mean anything to me.'\n\nOther Islanders made confessions, with Eoghan admitting to a crush on One Direction star Harry Styles.\n\nCassie revealed she had a closet full of sexy role play outfits and Adam broke the bro code with his best mate's ex.\n\nMatt was clearly in the doghouse with his new 'girlfriend' Vanessa, with the budding new couple speaking about it after the game finished back at the villa.\n\n'I should never keep count of something so petty,' Matt admitted.\n\nMeanwhile, Vanessa said that it changed their relationship: 'It has changed the way I see him. It's making me question it.'\n\nThe couple chatted it out together, before Matt was caught out as not knowing how to use iCloud to transfer the number to different phones.\n\n'Why would you keep tabs of exactly how many people you've slept with?'\n\n'It's not the number that pisses me off. It's the fact that you kept tabs,' Vanessa continued.\n\n'Why would you keep a book about it?' she added.\n\nLove Island Australia continues on Channel Nine, Wednesday, 8.30pm.", "description": "Love Island is known for its raunchy games.
