Having served in the military since he was 20 years old, Kupiga is already celebrating his retirement at the young age of 36 years old.\n\n\u201cThe boring middle is over!\u201d he wrote in a post on Reddit, where hundreds of thousands of members gather on the \u201cfinancial independence\u201d board to discuss their strategies, failures and successes on the road to FIRE.\n\nHow did he do it? Well, it starts with $20,000 in annual pay he will receive as part of his undisclosed medical retirement, which is issued when a medical condition prevents a member of the military to adequately perform his or her job.\n\nIt\u2019s more than that, though.\n\n\u201cI spent my entire career saving everything extra. Every time I was promoted, the extra money went to savings,\u201d Kupiga wrote. \u201cTax returns, special duty pay, deployment pay, enlistment bonuses, raises, everything went into mutual funds.\u201d\n\nHe explained that he was a single dad for 10 years, without a car for more than five of those. He was already on his FIRE track when he recently got married and bought a home in Florida. Here\u2019s the broad overview of his assets:\n\nInvestments: $210,000\n\nHouse: $310,000\n\nRental property: $65,000 (value minus mortgage)\n\nTotal: $585,000\n\nAssuming a withdrawal rate of 3%, Kupiga says he\u2019ll end up with $26,000 a year with no mortgage and no health insurance costs. Even if the market gets in the way of his withdrawals, the $20,000, he says, will provide the necessities.\n\nHis recent nuptials, however, completely shake-up the financial equation, in what would appear to be good way: His wife has a job paying a six-figure salary.\n\n\u201cIf she were let go tomorrow, we would be totally fine,\u201d Kupiga wrote. \u201cShe works now because she wants to (and she admittedly always will in some capacity).\u201d As long as she\u2019s working, he says they\u2019re saving \u201ca disgusting amount\u201d of her income.\n\nOthers were quick to point out that having such a safety net makes the leap into FIRE a lot less intimidating, but that\u2019s not how Kupiga sees it.\n\n\u201cMe getting married was way more of a financial hang up than a benefit. That house that I paid cash for? If it was just me and my kid, I\u2019d still be living in a one-bedroom apartment and have an extra 300K,\u201d he wrote, adding that his retirement income covers all of the necessities, while her money is reserved for the nice-to-haves, not the stuff they need.\n\n\u201cThe FIRE path for me was paved with a low desire for expensive things,\u201d Kupiga wrote, touching on a basic FIRE tenet. \u201cThis week I threw away 10-year-old pants because the zipper finally broke on them. I have sandals that are 20 years old.\u201d", "description": "A military career isn\u2019t typically the path to take if someone\u2019s looking to reach hallowed \u201cFIRE\u201d territory \u2014 financial independence, retire early.
