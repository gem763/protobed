Linton is just one of the big-name investors it has attracted. The former Canopy Growth CEO said he has recently bought an \u201c8-to-10% stake\u201d in the company, what he described as \u201ca serious six-figure, not-quite-seven-figure\u201d investment. He was also named to the board of directors.\n\nBut Psychedelic Meds Are Different\n\nAnother big-name investor is Canadian businessman Kevin O\u2019Leary, who is perhaps best known as a cast member of ABC\u2019s Shark Tank. Although he shares Linton\u2019s enthusiasm for the medical breakthrough potential for psychedelic-inspired treatments for opioids and other addictions, he embraces the differences.\n\nO\u2019Leary hasn't invested in any cannabis company, explaining he never wanted to be part of the recreational side of that sector. Psychedelics is different, he said during an interview from Las Vegas recently. MindMed has no interest in the recreational market. It is focusing solely on FDA-approved medicines.\n\n\u201cThat I can endorse,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThat I can invest in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe opioid crisis is affecting millions of American families and it is costing the country $500 billion (C$661.5 million) a year. We owe it to those families to explore all options and find a solution,\u201d O\u2019Leary explained. He said:\n\n\u201cI invested in MindMed because they are approaching psychedelics through rigorous science and FDA trials. The psychedelics space is vastly different than cannabis and legalized recreational use will never happen; psychedelics need to be approved as FDA drugs.\u201d\n\nThe opioid crisis is a huge societal problem, he said. But psychedelics is doing something else:\n\n\u201cThis is creating medicine that will help people.\u201d\n\nSizeable Position\n\nO\u2019Leary has taken what he describes as a \u201csizeable position\u201d in the company, but refused to be specific.\n\nAccording to MindMed\u2019s founder and director, JR Rahn, the company is currently conducting Phase II clinical trials. He plans to take the company public later this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ambition of the company to be a public company by the end of the year,\u201d he said in an interview from Toronto.\n\nThe focus of the company as been the 18-MC molecule, which it has synthesized from the psychedelic ibogain. It is a non-hallucinogenic substance. The aim is to use it as a treatment for opioid addiction. Once it receives FDA approval, the company will then look at other markets.\n\n\u201cThere is a renaissance opportunity here,\u201d Rahn said, adding:\n\n\u201cThere is a sea change on how we look at these substances as a therapeutic medicine that creates wellness.\u201d\n\nAnd he is looking for people like Linton to help steer the company to that end. \u201cBruce is a pioneer. He created the cannabis industry,\u201d Rahn said. \u201cThere is a lot of learning on that history.\u201d\n\nHexo Shares Plummet On Revenue Revisions\n\nShares of Hexo Corp (NYSE: ), (TSX: ) lost 6.72% in New York on Monday, continuing its losses from last week after the Quebec-based cannabis grower announced a fourth-quarter revenue warning in advance of its next financial .\n\nIn an update last Thursday, Hexo said its fourth-quarter revenue will come in somewhere between C$14.5 million (US$10.96 million) and C$16.5 million (US$11.04 million). That is a substantial reduction from predictions last June that had Hexo\u2019s fourth-quarter results showing revenues that would be double its third-quarter figures of C$13 million (US$9.83 million).\n\nHexo Weekly\n\nThe reaction was swift. Hexo\u2019s shares dropped almost 23%. Markets in Canada were closed Monday for the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nLast week, Hexo also withdrew its forecast for fiscal 2020 results. It had previously expected fiscal 2020 net revenues to hit C$400 million (US$302.36 million). The withdrawal of the forecast also comes about one week after the company\u2019s chief financial officer Michael Monahan resigned.\n\n\n\nHexo\u2019s next earnings report will be released on Oct. 24.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com) covering: Canopy Growth Corp, Hexo Corp.
