(AP) - Getting behind by two touchdowns early doesn\u2019t help any team\u2019s running game, but early deficits are just one reason why the Los Angeles Chargers\u2019 ground game has been stuck in neutral the past two weeks.\n\nThe Chargers averaged 103.5 yards on the ground in their first four games but have been held to a total of 67 in losses to Denver and Pittsburgh. It is the first time since 1983 that they have gained 35 yards or less running the ball in two straight games.\n\nLos Angeles travels to Tennessee on Sunday for a matchup of 2-4 teams and is hoping to cure some of its offensive shortcomings.\n\n\u201cYou can fall behind early and still have plenty of time to catch up. But in that third quarter, if you are down two or three scores, it is hard to hand off that much,\u201d coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\nThe Chargers called only 12 runs out of 62 plays in the second half after halftime deficits of 17-0 to Denver and 21-0 to Pittsburgh. But even when they tried to establish some semblance of a ground game in the first half it has not panned out.\n\nMelvin Gordon\u2019s return has not gone as smoothly as hoped. The star back, who held out for two months due to a contract dispute, is only averaging 2.5 yards per carry with his longest run going for seven yards.\n\nGordon is hoping that if the Chargers can get a lead or keep the score within a touchdown, that he can get more carries and establish more consistency.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rhythm you can get into with eight carries, I don\u2019t care what running back you are,\u201d he said. \u201cI get stronger down the line. With the more carries you get, you run that play and you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, this is how they are playing it.\u2019 So when you run that play again, I know how I\u2019m going to treat it. But when you get eight carries, you\u2019ve seen the same play for the first time every time. There\u2019s no feel to it, and you never get a feel for the game.\u201d\n\nLynn has had Gordon and Austin Ekeler both in on 11 plays, but Pittsburgh kept a linebacker focused on the backs to prevent any huge receptions on checkdowns after Ekeler had 15 receptions against the Broncos.\n\nEkeler is third in the AFC with 611 scrimmage yards but was held to a season-low 28 last week. Ekeler is still getting his share of touches despite Gordon\u2019s return.\n\nAlso hampering the run game are the team\u2019s struggles on first down. After six weeks, the Chargers are averaging 3.41 yards on first down, which is fourth-worst in the league.\n\n\u201cIt does not help getting behind the sticks early and it has been happening too often,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nThe Chargers are also trying to build a run game behind an offensive line where only one of the starters has five years or more of experience due to the absence of left tackle Russell Okung (blood clots) and center Mike Pouncey (season-ending neck surgery). They are averaging only 2.7 yards on runs up the middle, which is fourth-worst, and 3.1 yards around left end, which is next-to-last.\n\nOne way they can get more consistency is if Philip Rivers has fewer turnovers. He has had three in the first half the past two games which has led to 14 points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a handful of plays we\u2019ve been unable to overcome. It hasn\u2019t been 60 minutes of bad football, it\u2019s just enough we haven\u2019t been able to overcome it,\u201d Rivers said.\n\nThe Titans defense comes into Sunday\u2019s game ranked eighth overall and 15th against the run. Gordon did not play in last year\u2019s game in London due to a hamstring injury but rushed for a career-high 196 the last time he faced them in 2016.\n\n\u201cI feel good, but just physically and mentally it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s hard for a back to make it happen getting the carries that I\u2019ve been getting,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI know that we want to run the ball. I know that. Coach Lynn makes a big emphasis on that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Getting behind by two touchdowns early doesn't help any team's running game, but early deficits are just one reason why the Los Angeles Chargers' ground game has been stuck in neutral the past two weeks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/steelers_chargers_football_62816_c0-88-2136-1334_s1200x700.jpg?df14c8fc171a83e9a5dacf59256f3af35cbfbc20", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
