She looked like\u2014surprise\u2014an inmate of a prison.\n\nAnna Delvey, Felicity Huffman, and Lori Loughlin Show the Serious Business of Dressing for Court\n\nOr maybe not. Like all good memes, the sight of Huffman in cargo served as a carte blanche for anyone wishing to make an easy joke. More than a few armchair comedians mistook her get-up for a jumpsuit (people, it's clearly two pieces, ugh!), commending the one piece\u2019s trendiness as so hot for fall. Others predicted it would be a popular Halloween costume.\n\nIra Madison III, a contributor for The Daily Beast found similarities between Huffman's ensemble and a jumpsuit currently on sale at H&M. It can be yours for $49.99.\n\nGabe Bergado, an entertainment writer for Teen Vogue, wrote a parody outfit ID\u2014Balenciaga cap, Goop boiler suit, and of course, Under Armour kicks. (The sports brand did not respond to The Daily Beast's request for an opinion on their new, infamous fan.)\n\nEven Martha Stewart chimed in, saying at the Vanity Fair Summit that Huffman \u201c[s]hould style her outfit a little bit more. She looked pretty schlumpy.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Huffman did put a little effort into her appearance, wearing trendy-for-a-Mom New Balances and what looks to be a FitBit. (The Daily Beast previously reported the step tracker repeatedly set off metal detectors during a court appearance this spring.) Those accoutrements only further punctuate the immense privilege she has inside a prison where the average sentence is around five years.\n\nThe day before her release, Huffman spent her final hours behind bars taking what almost looked like a long, therapeutic walk with a fellow inmate, whose face The Daily Mail blurred out. If there is any sartorial hero in this story, it very well may be that anonymous woman, who sported a genuinely trendy stone blue fleece. Very Sandy Liang for Spring 2020!\n\nAudiences must miss award season, because Huffman\u2019s appearance suddenly because fodder for the kind of analysis usually reserved for Oscar dresses.\n\n\u201cIn the photos, the Desperate Housewives star wore a dark green jacket over her matching two-piece prison uniform,\u201d the Mail wrote. \u201cUnlike previous snaps of the felon, her blonde tresses weren\u2019t hidden under a cap, but rather pulled back in a taut ponytail.\u201d\n\nHoward Bragman told The Hollywood Reporter that Huffman\u2019s drab presentation could be a savvy marketing ploy. (Once more with feeling: it also could be because she\u2019s a woman in prison dressing how women in prison dress.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Huffman] was trying to glam it up,\u201d Bragman said. \u201cWhen she went to court a few months ago, she looked like hell, which is what she was supposed to look like. As opposed to Lori Loughlin, who looked like she was trying to go to the People\u2019s Choice Awards.\u201d\n\nLoughlin wore a beige blazer and matching pants, but sure.\n\nLet columnists continue to debate whether or not Huffman\u2019s measly punishment fit her crime. But if this entire episode delivered any justice, it\u2019s probably the fact that we don\u2019t have to see her in a green uniform ever again.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
