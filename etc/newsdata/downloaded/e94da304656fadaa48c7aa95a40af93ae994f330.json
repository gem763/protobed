We looked at the charts of AMD on Monday and things were positive. Let's turn to the charts and technical indicators here on Wednesday morning to see how we should proceed.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of AMD, below, we can see that prices stalled ever so slightly at $34, which is the same area or level that stopped the rally in June, July and August. Prices are still above the rising 50-day moving average line and the bullish 200-day line. The volume of trading does not should anything unusual and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows that buyers have been more aggressive this month. The trend-folllowing Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has turned up above the zero line for an outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of AMD, below, we can see a bullish alignment of the indicators. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line and not extended as they were in 2018. The weekly OBV line shows a new uptrend from the middle of September and the MACD oscillator is poised to cross to the upside from above the zero line for a fresh outright go long signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of AMD, below, we can see an upside price target of $37.11, or a new high. Prices would need to back up to below $32.60 for the chart to change to a column of \"O's,\" and even if that happened it really would not turn the chart bearish.\n\nBottom line strategy: The charts and indicators of AMD tell me that prices are headed higher. Aggressive traders could use a shallow dip to buy or add to long positions.", "description": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares look ready to move higher despite third-quarter results that were at best in line with expectations....AMD", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Advanced Micro Devices Still Looks Ready To Rise Despite In-Line Results", "Aggressive Traders Could Use A Shallow Dip To Buy Or Add To Long Positions In Shares Of The Semiconductor Giant.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bret Jensen", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/a25c62bc-47e0-11e8-a89a-7532eff1bf82.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
