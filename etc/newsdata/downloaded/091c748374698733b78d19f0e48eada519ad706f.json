[but] the benefits are very rewarding for them, they get rental allowance and subsidies.\n\n'I've had people apply for a job and [their application] says \"I really don't want to work but I have to apply for 10 jobs and this is one of them, sorry for wasting your time\".'\n\nIn one example shared by Mr Wynn, a job seeker had submitted a resume that was completely blank, save for some scattered punctuation.\n\nOne applicant had sent in a completely blank resume , save for an errant punctuation mark under each subheading\n\nAnother job seeker who had extensive experience in hairdressing used this resume to apply for a senior position in used car sales\n\nMr Wynn said he wants to see a crack down on workers not taking their obligations seriously (stock image)\n\nAnother job seeker, with qualifications in laboring and construction work as well as two diplomas in business, had applied for a national sales role in the technology sector.\n\nMr Wynn said sifting through the thousands of fake responses was time consuming and costly, and called on the welfare system to do more to ensure its recipients were taking their obligations seriously.\n\n'The extra work it's created for me, to go through all of this... if we're going to have a system, make it accountable,' he said.\n\n'They should need to apply for relevant jobs.'\n\nMichaela Cash, Minister for Employment, said her focus was on getting people off welfare and into work, as 'taxpayers expect nothing less'.\n\n'What this shows is that there is a cohort of jobseekers receiving assistance from taxpayers who are not taking their obligations seriously,' she said.\n\n'If you receive welfare and are deemed to have mutual obligations, then you need to fulfil those or you will find your payments suspended until you reengage with the system.\n\n'Taxpayers should not be expected to fund job seekers submitting blank applications.'\n\nMinister for Employment Michaela Cash slammed the revelations, noting 'taxpayers should not be expected to fund job seekers submitting blank applications' (stock image)\n\nMs Cash said she and the government were determined to get as many Australians as possible off welfare and into a job, and the 'dignity, value and importance' of being able to look after oneself 'could not be understated'\n\nMr Wynn said he was told by a Centrelink representative the agency did not have the resources to monitor the applicants to ensure they were applying for relevant jobs, which he says begs the question 'why have the system at all?'\n\n'This system is a waste of time, as well as dollars, and the government needs to find a better system to ensure those receiving benefits are not just appearing to be actively looking for work but are being realistic about the job search activities,' he said.\n\nThe recruiter said there is a glut of work that requires minimal qualifications available for those who need it, including in call centres, customer service and reception.\n\n'If they want a job, there's work out there,' he said.\n\n'Why do we insist [on the current Newstart system] if people are simply just sending off resumes to any 10 jobs?'\n\nMs Cash said there is a record number of Australians in employment, and employers are 'screaming out for workers who are eager for a job'.\n\n'The dignity, value and importance of providing for yourself and your family cannot be understated,' she said.", "description": "In the past two weeks, recruiter Graham Wynn has had 4,741 resumes from people on Centrelink, only 38 of which were relevant to the job being applied for.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/07/19725904-0-image-a-35_1571119984518.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
