[opposition] bill goes through.\u201d However, the slip will make it harder for him to argue to the British people that he is only reluctantly asking them to vote in a fourth major national poll in four years.\n\nJohnson said in the House of Commons as recently as Tuesday evening: \"I don\u2019t want an election, the public don\u2019t want an election.\" However his Brexit strategy thus far has led to suspicion that his goal all along has been to force a national vote.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nIn a bruising first PMQs, Johnson also faced strong criticism from some of the ex-Conservative MPs he removed from the party's parliamentary ranks on Tuesday, in punishment for their support of the opposition plan, and was forced to defend past comments about women who wear the burqa.\n\nOpposition MPs applauded Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi after he criticized the prime minister's August 2018 Daily Telegraph column in which he said women who wear the burqa resembled \"a bank robber\" or \"letterboxes.\"\n\n\"For those of us who from a young age have had to endure and face up to being called names such as 'towel head, 'or 'Taliban' or coming from 'bongo bongo land,' we can appreciate full well the hurt and pain felt by already vulnerable Muslim women when they are described as looking like 'bank robbers' and 'letterboxes,'\" Dhesi said, calling for Johnson to apologize and to launch an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party \u2014 something he committed to during the leadership campaign this summer.\n\nJohnson responded that the article as a whole had been a \"a strong liberal defense\" of everyone's right to wear what they like in the U.K. and said he had appointed the \"most diverse Cabinet in the history of this country.\"\n\nMPs applauded again, however, when former minister Margot James, who voted against the government on Tuesday and has had the Conservative whip withdrawn, appealed to Johnson to heed Margaret Thatcher's advice that \"advisers advise, ministers decide\" in relation to his senior adviser Dominic Cummings, who MPs suspect had a key role in the hard-line stance against Brexit rebels.\n\nJohnson condemned Tuesday's vote, which paved the way for MPs to put forward a backbench bill requiring a Brexit delay should no deal be in place by October 19. He called the planned legislation a \"surrender bill\" and accused Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and other opponents of undermining his negotiation with the EU toward a new Brexit deal.\n\nCorbyn hit back: \u201cI fail to see how I can be accused of undermining negotiations because there are no negotiations taking place.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
