But soon the isolation from the rest of the world makes the two become mad.\n\nShot in striking black and white \u2014 making the movie even creepier \u2014 \"The Lighthouse\" is a triumph in filmmaking. From the camera movements to the lighting, production design, directing, and acting, it's a complexly orchestrated exploration into insanity disguised as a chamber piece.\n\nAnd to pull that off, Eggers (who wrote the script with his brother, Max) turns up the crazy a little more than in \"The Witch.\" There are demented seagulls, a mermaid, octopus tendons, and the beacon of light at the top of the lighthouse that makes the men lose their minds.\n\nRobert Pattinson goes mad in \"The Lighthouse.\" A24\n\nPattinson plays Ephraim, who spends his days doing the backbreaking work to keep the lighthouse clean and in order. Dafoe plays Thomas, who speaks like a pirate and whose only job is to keep the light in the lighthouse shining bright. And he will not share that responsibility with Ephraim, who very much wants a turn.\n\nOver time, both men show signs that they are beginning to lose it. From the excessive drinking to Ephraim's visions of mermaids and octopuses, things start to get weird. And it only gets weirder when Ephraim catches a glance of Thomas taking care of the light \u2014 in the nude! Eventually, Ephraim and Thomas begin to turn on each other, leading to situations that start out funny but become horrific.\n\nThroughout, though, Eggers, Pattinson, and Dafoe's talents shine. The movie is beautifully crafted and acted. And it's very impressive that Pattinson has the acting chops to keep up with Dafoe in the crazy department.\n\n\"The Lighthouse\" is a sea tale come to life. And like many of those tall tales sailors passed down through generations, they are really examinations of how fragile the human psyche is.\n\nThe business details:", "description": "The movie marks the second feature from the director Robert Eggers, who found acclaim with his striking debut, \"The Witch.\"", "authors": ["Jason Guerrasio"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7239a82e22af0fd31cc347-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
