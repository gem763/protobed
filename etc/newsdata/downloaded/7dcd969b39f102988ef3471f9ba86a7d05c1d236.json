Did Varney not see that clip?\n\nOr was there a Trump campaign staffer standing out of frame with a gun trained on him while this segment was happening? Even by Fox \u201cstate media\u201d standards, this is way, way out there.\n\nI thought the standard defense of Trump\u2019s lying, including lying to his own fans about matters as momentous as whether the wall is being built, is that it simply doesn\u2019t matter big-picture. We know he\u2019s a bad character but look at the bottom line. Look at the judges he\u2019s appointed. Look at economic growth. Look at deregulation. Look at him resisting his own advisors\u2019 eagerness for war with Iran. Gotta take the bitter with the sweet. Righties made their peace with Trump\u2019s personal flaws in the summer of 2016. I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose a single vote, he famously said during the campaign, marveling aloud at the limitless line of moral credit the \u201cparty of values\u201d had extended to him in the name of advancing its agenda. If Varney wanted to repel this attack by Walsh, that\u2019s all he had to say. \u201cYou\u2019re making a character argument that failed three years ago and will fail catastrophically in the primary next year.\u201d\n\nBut that probably wouldn\u2019t have worked for Fox\u2019s most important viewer. \u201cLoyalty\u201d requires defending the president in all things, however absurdly. If that means telling the audience with a straight face that he never lies then that\u2019s what it means.\n\nWalsh is correct about the specific lie at issue in the clip, by the way. The background on that is here. Trump made up the fact that the Chinese had called after he hiked tariffs on them late last week, which implied that they were feeling the pressure and eager to make a deal. That created a spark of hope that the trade war might end soon, giving investors a reason not to dump their shares just yet. But all the Chinese did was put out a statement saying that they remain committed to negotiations. There\u2019s no evidence that they\u2019re about to capitulate. To Varney all of that falls under the heading of \u201cspin,\u201d never mind that the same \u201cspin\u201d told by someone who\u2019s not in charge of the DOJ might earn them criminal charges for market manipulation.", "description": "\"That's not a lie.
