Calibra is a Facebook subsidiary that will function as a digital wallet for the digital currency.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg was criticized from the left for Facebook\u2019s entrance into the cryptocurrency realm before solving the company\u2019s existing problems and for creating a new avenue for bad actors to enrich themselves.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, California Democrat and the committee chair, called for a moratorium on Facebook\u2019s digital currency efforts until after Congress had examined the issue, but Mr. Zuckerberg only committed to wait to launch the digital currency project anywhere until it received American regulators\u2019 approval.\n\nRep. Brad Sherman, California Democrat, said that Libra would effectively become the \u201cZuck buck\u201d and that Mr. Zuckerberg would be \u201cmaking powerful burglary tools and letting your business partners commit the burglary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that you\u2019ve got at least a hundred lawyers who will tell you that what you\u2019re doing is legal, and that you will be safe. But given the harm that this could do, they could be very wrong,\u201d Mr. Sherman told Mr. Zuckerberg. \u201cAnd if this explodes the way it might, especially, you will not be able to hide behind the idea that you didn\u2019t create the Libra organization that it\u2019s just your business partners that have wallets designed for drug dealers and terrorists.\u201d\n\nRepublicans voiced similar concerns about the digital currency\u2019s potential to cause harm, but did not appear to have already made up their minds about the digital currency\u2019s function.\n\nRep. Bill Huizenga, Michigan Republican, agreed with his Democratic colleagues that Facebook and Libra were tools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a neutral tool just like a car, a plane, a gun, a knife, all of which have been used as weapons for nefarious things at times and all [are] things that have been used to benefit,\u201d Mr. Huizenga said. \u201cThese various tools are, in society though, regulated.\u201d\n\nRep. Steve Stivers, Ohio Republican, said he was concerned that the establishment of a private currency such as Libra could undermine other currencies around the world.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of people in the world who are hoping that your innovation works, but I think you may have bitten off more than you can chew by trying to create a private currency,\u201d Mr. Stivers said.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg told the committee that while America was debating such issues, China was not waiting. He said if a Chinese financial system became the standard in more countries, then America\u2019s desired sanctions, protections, and oversight would be impossible to impose retroactively.\n\n\u201cThe goal of Libra is to build a global payment system rather than a currency,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cBecause it is global in nature we figured that it might be better to not solely rely on one country\u2019s currency, but because we\u2019re an American company and the American economy is the strongest in the world it makes sense for any reserve to be primarily U.S. dollars and extend America\u2019s financial leadership in that way \u2026 We have clearly not locked down how this is going to work yet.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
