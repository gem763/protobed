That and more in Trysta Krick's Week 7 overreactions. USA TODAY\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 The Jets\u2019 upset of the Dallas Cowboys was a feel-good first win of the season.\n\nBut if they can find a way to beat the New England Patriots in front of a national television audience tonight (8:15 p.m., ESPN), they\u2019d suddenly become one of the biggest and strangest stories in the NFL.\n\nSure, at 2-4 they\u2019d be far from saving their season. But they\u2019d have a legitimate chance to get back on track, and no one would have thought that would be possible just two weeks ago.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy. The Patriots haven\u2019t lost since December, winning 11 straight games, including their postseason run to a sixth straight Super Bowl title. But instead of dwelling on the daunting challenge ahead of them, the Jets are focusing on the chance to change everything about their season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fun game,\u201d Jets running back Le\u2019Veon Bell said. \u201cAnd I think we a great opportunity to kind of shock the world, in a sense.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch for as the Jets host the Patriots:\n\nBig test for Sam Darnold\n\nDarnold returned last week after missing three games because of mono and played better than anyone could have expected in the win over the Cowboys. Darnold saw the defense well and made quick, correct decisions completing 23 of 32 passes for 388 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.\n\nBut this week will be a much tougher test. The Patriots have allowed the fewest yards per game in the NFL, and lead the league in interceptions (14) and are second in sacks (25) through six games.\n\nNew York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold (14) looks to throw against the Dallas Cowboys in the first half.

Still, Darnold heads into this game with a lot of confidence.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what they\u2019re known for. They have different looks, they put players in different spots,\u201d Darnold said of the Patriots. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to focus on the certain looks and all those types of things. So we'll figure it out and we'll go out there and execute.\u201d\n\nIf Darnold can have a big night against the mighty Patriots' defense, it will be the biggest sign yet that he\u2019s making a second-year leap.\n\nReturn of the other \u2018QB\u2019\n\nC.J. Mosley is listed as questionable on the injury report, but the expectation is that he\u2019ll be back on the field for the first time since Week 1 \u2014 Mosley declared \u201cI\u2019m playing\u201d last week.\n\nFor the Jets\u2019 defense, Mosley\u2019s return should be every bit as big as Darnold\u2019s was for the offense.\n\n\u201cIt's like getting your quarterback back on the defense,\u201d Jets coach Adam Gase said Friday. \u201cIt will be great, if he's back out there for us, that's a big deal for us.\u201d\n\nNew York Jets linebacker C.J.

(Brad Penner/AP Images for Panini) (Photo: AP)\n\nMosley has played only three quarters this season, all in Week 1 vs. Buffalo, but made it clear just how big of an impact he can make: He returned an interception for a touchdown, and with him on the field, the Bills never advanced past the Jets' 25-yard line.\n\nWith Mosley off the field, Buffalo scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns to steal a win.\n\n\u201cWe saw it for a half,\u201d Gase said of Mosley\u2019s impact. \u201cHe scored more points than the offense for a few games.\u201d\n\nThe Jets\u2019 defense was better than expected with Mosley out. Now, against Tom Brady and the Patriots, we\u2019ll likely get to see how good this unit is with Mosley back on the field.\n\nThe Jets\u2019 biggest concern\n\nThe Jets have major offensive line questions heading into this game. Left tackle Kelvin Beachum (ankle) is listed as doubtful and almost certainly won\u2019t play. Meanwhile, left guard Alex Lewis (neck), center Ryan Kalil (shoulder) and right guard Brian Winters (shoulder/knee) are all listed as questionable. And Kelechi Osemele (shoulder) is listed as doubtful, but obviously won\u2019t be playing in the midst of his injury dispute with the Jets.\n\nNew York Jets center Ryan Kalil (far left), quarterback Sam Darnold (center), and offensive tackle Kelvin Beachum (68) celebrate Darnold's 92-yard touchdown pass to Robby Anderson (not pictured) in the second quarter.

(Photo: Danielle Parhizkaran/NorthJersey.com)\n\nAssuming Lewis, Kalil and Winters all play \u2014 which seems likely \u2014 the offensive line has a chance to hold it together. That group held its own playing most of the second half against the Cowboys. But it won\u2019t be easy against a Patriots team that is averaging more than four sacks per game.\n\nFor the Jets to have a real chance, the offensive line must give Darnold at least a little bit of time to pass and create enough of a push for Le\u2019Veon Bell to have room to run.\n\nMost importantly, they must stay healthy because if the Jets suffer another injury on the offensive line, their depth will be almost non-existent.\n\nBreaking bad (history)?\n\nThe Jets are due for a win over the Patriots in just about every way.\n\nThey have won only one of their last 11 games against the Patriots, and have lost seven straight since that lone win, an overtime triumph in December 2015. If the Patriots beat the Jets on Monday, it will mark the first time that they\u2019ve swept the season series in four consecutive years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jets are also searching for their first home win on Monday Night Football since 2011.\n\nNone of that history is good, but they say streaks are meant to be broken. The Jets will have the opportunity to break some bad streaks tonight.\n\nAndy Vasquez is the Jets beat writer for NorthJersey.com.
