REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nPresident Joko Widodo on Friday ordered a delay in a planned vote on the controversial bill - originally slated for Tuesday - and said 14 articles needed further review before it was deliberated by a new parliament, whose term begins next month.\n\nStudents rallied on Monday in the capital Jakarta - where some climbed the gates of the parliament to hang banners - and cities including Yogyakarta, in central Java, and Makassar, on Sulawesi island, to oppose the bill.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers whose term will end this month met in the presidential palace for talks with the president.\n\n\u201cThe bill was delayed so that we could get input, better substance that is in accordance to what the people want,\u201d Widodo told reporters after the meeting, adding the code could be included in the next term of parliament.\n\nMulfachri Harahap, an MP, said he still hoped a new version could be put to the vote before the end of the month, adding: \u201cEven though there are articles considered problematic, they are not many and they\u2019re debatable.\u201dCritics say the bill violates free speech and discriminates against religious minorities, women and LGBT people. But Islamic groups, including Indonesia\u2019s biggest Muslim group, Nahdlatul Ulama, say the changes reflect \u201cthe character and the personality of the Indonesian people and the nation\u201d.\n\nThe revisions to the country\u2019s criminal code, which has not been updated since its inception during the Dutch colonial-era, also include penalties for insulting the president\u2019s dignity, a four-year jail term for abortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape, and a prison term for black magic.\n\nThe planned revisions had spurred Australia to update its travel advice, warning citizens of risks they could face from extra-marital or gay sex should the law be passed.\n\nBali, a Hindu enclave in mostly Muslim Indonesia and the country\u2019s most important tourism destination, is especially popular with visitors from Australia, where one newspaper greeted the news on Friday with the headline: \u201cBali Sex Ban.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy, because there\u2019s a lot of couples coming to Bali on, like, a romantic holiday, and they are not married, they might be just a boyfriend or girlfriend,\u201d said Sienna Scott, an Australian holidaying on the island.\n\nLocal officials said they hoped there might be changes to the bill before it becomes law. \u201cIf possible, articles which are sensitive to our lives in Bali can be reviewed or eliminated,\u201d Bali deputy governor, Tjokorda Oka Artha Ardana Sukawati, said.\n\nIn Jakarta, students protested in front of parliament against the criminal code and also changes to the anti-graft laws that opponents fear will harm the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cBecause reform has been corrupted, we want the country to go back to the reform mandate,\u201d said Manik Marganamahendra, 22, a student at the University of Indonesia.", "description": "Thousands of students protested at rallies across Indonesia on Monday against a new criminal code that would outlaw sex outside marriage and gay sex, as lawmakers met the president to discuss how to proceed with a bill that has divided Indonesians.", "authors": ["Stanley Widianto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432938652&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0XV"}
