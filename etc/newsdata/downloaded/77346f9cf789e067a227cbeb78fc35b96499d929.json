But Saudi, U.S. and European officials have blamed Iran for the attacks, charging that the Houthi claims were an effort to obscure the country\u2019s role in the attacks, the Journal noted.\n\nCrude oil was buoyed Thursday after the U.S. Defense Department announced the deployment of U.S. military personnel and equipment to Saudi Arabia, arresting a pullback in crude fueled in part by news reports, citing Saudi officials, that the country had restored production capacity to more than 11 million barrels a day.\n\nAnalysts remained skeptical of the figure, but said it was possible that capacity was returning more quickly than had been anticipated. Still, oil market bulls said the end of the post-attack rally overlooked the damage to global spare capacity caused by the attack. After all, said Jason Gammel, equity analyst at investment bank Jefferies, a large part of any rebound in Saudi capacity would be due to redundant capacity at the country\u2019s damaged Abqaiq plant, which itself represents the bulk of the country\u2019s spare capacity.\n\nAs a result of the attack, Gammel estimates that global spare capacity is now well below 1 million barrels a day.\n\n\u201cThe market appears to be more focused on what will likely be oversupply in 2020, but the complacency now means that any other incidents will have more severe price repercussions,\u201d he said, in a note.\n\nIn other energy trading, November gasoline RBX19, -0.92% fell 0.9% to $2.421 a gallon, while November heating oil HOX19, -0.82% was off 0.7% at $1.9359.\n\nNovember natural-gas futures NGX19, -0.94% declined 0.9% to $2.421 per million British thermal units.", "description": "Oil futures fell Friday, extending a decline after Saudi Arabia declares a partial cease-fire in its conflict with Yemen.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS190_houthi_ZG_20190927075357.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
