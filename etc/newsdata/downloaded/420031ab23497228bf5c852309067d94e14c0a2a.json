That makes the 52-year-old lawyer a compelling character in the drama set off by Democrats\u2019 impeachment drive \u2014 and, for the president, potentially a dangerous one.\n\nAs lawyers often do, Eisenberg took notes in meetings with Trump, a standard practice that \u201cdrove the president absolutely bonkers,\u201d according to one former White House official. \u201cHis sense was people were taking notes because they were going to write a book or testify against him,\u201d the former official said.\n\nIt was Eisenberg to whom several alarmed White House officials turned when Trump urged Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. It was Eisenberg who then helped order the record of that call into a system used for ultra-secret classified information. And it was Eisenberg who, several reports say, consulted with political appointees at the Justice Department on how to handle a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about the Ukraine call.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/5b/48/9e2282cc4bdc8f056865e09c54f9/artboard-1.png\"\n\nFriends and colleagues who know Eisenberg also aren\u2019t surprised by his reported actions.\n\n\u201cHe keeps confidences. He doesn\u2019t run his mouth about stuff he shouldn\u2019t run his mouth about,\u201d said Michael Mukasey, a former attorney general in the Bush administration who worked with Eisenberg.\n\n\"John is a brilliant and careful lawyer,\" said Steven Engel, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel. \"It\u2019s no coincidence that he\u2019s been at the White House through four national security advisers and three White House counsels.\"\n\nOthers put it differently.\n\nEisenberg is \u201cextremely paranoid,\u201d in the words of one of his former colleagues at the NSC, where he is responsible for providing legal advice on everything from Syria to national security leak investigations to immigration.\n\nA national security specialist who was previously earning at least $1 million a year as a corporate attorney, Eisenberg is \u201ca classic lawyer,\u201d another former NSC colleague recalled: He never says anything when he can nod his approval and never puts anything in emails if he can say it to your face.\n\nEisenberg\u2019s conduct is coming under scrutiny in the wake of an explosive report from an intelligence community whistleblower, who alleged that records of Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders were being hidden to improperly shield the president from embarrassment. The White House isn\u2019t disputing that memos detailing the president\u2019s conversations have been stored in the system, known as NICE, but officials there insist it was done to protect sensitive calls from leaking that would hurt national security.\n\nNews reports, notably a recent account in the Washington Post, have also identified Eisenberg as the White House lawyer contacted by several NSC officials who were alarmed by the president\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky. What Eisenberg did next with that information is a matter of intense interest on Capitol Hill: Democrats have seized on the White House handling of the record of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call to allege a coverup.\n\nOne of those NSC officials, Trump\u2019s former top Russia aide Fiona Hill, told House lawmakers on Monday that she met with Eisenberg twice in mid-July to share her concerns about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s efforts to convince Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. She did so, Hill said, at the behest of then-national security adviser John Bolton. \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sundland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton had told her to say, according to a person familiar with Hill\u2019s testimony.\n\nThe White House is now reviewing how it handled Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky, according to an administration official. Eisenberg is at the center of that review, according to the New York Times, which reported that some aides are worried that the mission of the review is to find a scapegoat.\n\nSome of Eisenberg\u2019s former colleagues are concerned that he will be blamed for the Ukraine scandal, with one of them saying: \u201cThe White House is full of political actors with agendas and there can be a lot of knife fights over there. That\u2019s not something that John really engages in.\u201d\n\nIf so, it would be a remarkably familiar Washington plotline in a town in the throes of unprecedented political upheaval.\n\n\u201cIf I remember D.C.,\u201d observed Mukasey, \u201cit\u2019s a place where a lot of people don\u2019t always carry their weapons in view.\u201d\n\n***\n\nEisenberg, who attended Stanford University as an undergraduate and then studied law at Yale, joined the Trump White House at the start of the administration. He had previously been a partner in the D.C. office of Kirkland and Ellis, a law firm that has been stacked with prominent conservative luminaries over the years, including Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Attorney General Bill Barr and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.\n\nAs the longest-serving deputy in the counsel\u2019s office, Eisenberg is the most prominent remaining link to Don McGahn, Cipollone\u2019s predecessor as the White House\u2019s top lawyer. But unlike his former boss, who provided some of the most damaging testimony in the report by special counsel Robert Mueller and was accused by Trump of leaking, Eisenberg has a legendary reputation for secrecy.\n\n\u201cJohn was distrustful of information flows to everywhere else in the building,\u201d said a former NSC colleague. \u201cHe inherently was of the view that anything that could leak would leak and so he was also incredibly conscious of trying to restrict conversations to only those that he really, really, really felt needed to know.\u201d\n\nOthers described Eisenberg as a \u201cby the book guy\u201d whose main concern was protecting the White House from legal risk. He at times raised concerns about actions Trump had proposed, including the extradition of dissident Turkish cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen. On that occasion, a former White House official said, Eisenberg\u2019s objections helped scuttle the idea.\n\n\u201cWhen John generally found things that he was uncomfortable with or would violate the law, he was often very quick to speak up and say that,\u201d said a former NSC official.\n\nBesides being fearful of leaks, Eisenberg is also anxious about how he appears in the press and is \u201cnaturally concerned about how his role is portrayed,\u201d said an administration colleague. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to be the center of the story and wants to stay in the background of things. He\u2019s very concerned anytime his name is mentioned\u201d in the press. (Early in the administration, NBC sent a camera crew to Eisenberg\u2019s house to ask him about a secret trip California Rep. Devin Nunes made to the White House to view intelligence on alleged Obama administration wrongdoing.)\n\nEisenberg has also been the lead lawyer on discussions about finding suspected leakers of national security information in the White House, according to a former White House official and another person familiar with the matter.\n\nEisenberg would give the legal OK for the White House Communications Agency to look into NSC staffers\u2019 accounts when they were suspected of leaking, according to the former official.\n\n\u201cThe attorneys always have to assist in that type of stuff when you\u2019re accessing somebody else\u2019s account. White House counsel always insisted that they participate in any of the fact-finding activities that would go on,\u201d this person said.\n\nOne former NSC official said it would make sense if it was Eisenberg who thought of putting the transcripts into the NICE system in the first place. \u201cJohn is well meaning but would be the exact type of person who would come up with the idea to stick this into a compartmented system,\u201d the former official said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where a lot of confidential stuff goes and has gone and the suggestion that this is somehow subject to special treatment I think is wrong,\u201d Mukasey said, adding that he assumes Eisenberg\u2019s motive would have been to prevent the records from leaking.\n\nAsked if Eisenberg was being set up as a fall guy, Mukasey said he didn\u2019t know but added: \u201cWashington is a dangerous place, which everybody knows. John is as straight as the edge of your computer screen. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\n\nMaking Eisenberg a scapegoat for the Ukraine scandal could prove risky for a president who has alienated many of his former top aides.\n\nAs the NSC\u2019s top lawyer, former officials said, Eisenberg likely would have been able to listen in on most calls with foreign heads of state and had a standing invitation to attend every top-level meeting on national security. His portfolio is sprawling, former officials say: He has worked on the Syria strikes, U.S. activities in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, election security and the expulsion of Russian diplomats after the Skripal poisonings in England.\n\n\u201cIf there are any buried bodies, Eisenberg knows where they are,\u201d said a former administration official.\n\n\"New folks come in and they know that he\u2019s a guy they want to keep on because they can rely on his judgment and his integrity,\" said Engel. \"John is a careful lawyer of high integrity, and based on my past work with him, I have every reason to think that he would deal with the situation appropriately as it arises.\"\n\nEisenberg\u2019s ties to the traditional GOP establishment distinguish him from many of the officials who joined the Trump administration in the wake of his surprise victory in 2016. He donated the maximum $2,700 to Jeb Bush\u2019s primary campaign in August 2015, but unlike many of his former Bush colleagues, he did not sign any of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d letters circulating during the campaign.\n\nBefore joining Kirkland and Ellis, he spent a year as associate deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, where he worked on national security matters. Eisenberg\u2019s name is one of several on a 2008 top-secret DOJ brief to a court arguing the government\u2019s position in favor of one of the Bush administration\u2019s controversial surveillance programs, along with John Demers, the current head of the national security division at the Department of Justice.\n\nMukasey recalled his worry at the time that Keith Alexander, who was then director of the National Security Agency, \u201cessentially wanted to kidnap\u201d Eisenberg to bring him over to work at Fort Meade. \u201cHe wanted him in the worst way, and it was because of his intelligence and insight,\u201d Mukasey said.\n\nEisenberg is \u201ccloser to what you imagine would be the sorts of people who would be filling those roles in a more traditional Republican administration,\u201d said one former official. \u201cHe\u2019s not somebody who you would think of as the crazy Trump Train.\u201d\n\nStill, another former administration official noted that, amid internal discussions on hot-button immigration issues in 2018, Eisenberg told colleagues to hew closely to Trump\u2019s wishes on the issue. \u201cNo, no, no: This is the president\u2019s objective,\u201d this person paraphrased him saying. \u201cThis is where we need to go.\u201d\n\nNancy Cook contributed to this story.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ec/2d/1f59fb86492996a041adfae117e5/191016-trump-zelensky-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
