I'm sure that the mix of new challenges, fantastic chefs and enthusiastic cooks will be a recipe for success, maybe with the odd disaster!\"\n\nImage caption Celebrity cook Ainsley Harriott (left) presented the show for 10 years\n\nChefs signed up include Mike Reid, Romy Gill, Akis Petretzikis, Ellis Barrie and Anna Haugh.\n\nIn every episode, chefs will now face two different taste tests, with contestants coming armed with a bag of ingredients bought within a \u00a310 budget.\n\nMeanwhile, Clark-Neal will be at the helm when Supermarket Sweep is resurrected by ITV2 on Monday. The show originally ran from 1993 to 2001 with the late Dale Winton as host. Winton died in 2018 at the age of 62.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
