REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China said it was cutting banks\u2019 reserve requirements for the third time this year, sending a ripple of optimism through currency markets though analysts questioned how much stimulus global central banks have left.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t be a flood of stimulus,\u201d said Neil Mellor, a senior FX strategist at BNY Mellon in London.\n\n\u201cChina and many other countries are in the same boat with fiscal policy constrained by debt and central banks resorting to jawboning and some targeted easing.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese currency in the offshore market CNH=D3 extended gains and was trading up 0.4% against the greenback at 7.1120 yuan.\n\nThe Australian dollar - its fortunes closely intertwined with the Chinese economy - gained 0.3% to $0.6837 AUD=D3 and strengthened 0.7% versus the Swiss franc AUDCHF=.\n\nAppetite for risky assets, already firm in early London trading thanks to strong data out of the United States, received a further boost after China unveiled its latest round of policy easing.\n\nDATA EYED\n\nThe dollar steadied against its rivals, and was heading for its biggest weekly drop in a month, as markets still expect the Federal Reserve would cut U.S. interest rates this month, even if the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday is stronger than expected.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY slipped 0.1% to 98.32 and was down 0.54% so far this week, its biggest weekly drop since early August.\n\n\u201cThe latest risk rally rests on a number of pillars like the recent upbeat U.S. data, receding political risks in the UK and hopes for an abatement of the US-China trade tensions,\u201d said Valentin Marinov, head of G-10 FX research and strategy at Credit Agricole in London.\n\nSurveys suggested the U.S. economy was in better shape than investors had feared. Services activity accelerated in August and private employers increased hiring more than expected.\n\nThe U.S. non-farm payrolls report due later on Friday was expected to show 158,000 jobs were added and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7% in August.\n\n\u201cInvestors are now hoping they can take this week\u2019s positivity over the finishing line, so fingers crossed the August U.S. payroll report ... doesn\u2019t throw a damp towel on the proceedings,\u201d said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nDespite the positive data, bond markets expect the Fed to cut interest rates this month. A total of 55 basis points of rate cuts are expected this year.\n\nA combination of likely dovish central banks and decent economic data also encouraged investors to buy the Canadian dollar CAD=D3 and the Swedish crown SEK=D3 against the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe European Central Bank is leaning toward a package that includes a rate cut, a beefed-up pledge to keep rates low for longer and compensation for banks over the side-effects of negative rates, sources told Reuters last week.", "description": "Risky currencies including the Australian dollar surged on Friday after China's central bank cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, with markets also expecting the European Central Bank to unveil more stimulus next week.", "authors": ["Saikat Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426727678&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8504S", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
