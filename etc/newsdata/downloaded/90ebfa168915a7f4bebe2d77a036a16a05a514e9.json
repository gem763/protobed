It\u2019s why the Beyhive is never getting the Formation World Tour DVD. It\u2019s why she never posts Instagram Stories, except to share the #BeforeILetGoChallenge. We, as a society, just couldn\u2019t handle all that power. So, we have to resign ourselves to the fact that if Beyonc\u00e9 had posted these new photos of her dressed up as Lisa Bonet for Halloween \u2026 we would not have been chill about it. Last year, Beyonc\u00e9 shared not one, but two different costumes for Halloween. First, she was the spitting image of Toni Braxton on her self-titled album cover. Then, she was style icon and Olympic athlete FloJo. Now, a year later, she shared never-before-seen photos of her third costume, Lisa Bonet, mother of Zo\u00eb Kravitz, and the Huxtable daughter we all wanted to be. Oh, did we say third costume? We meant third and fourth. Not one Bonet look, but two!\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 as Lisa Bonet i\u2019m losing it \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/qV3DOs37wO \u2014 gfg (@comewhenicall) September 20, 2019\n\nThe queen also shared a bonus Sir and Rumi pic. She just keeps on giving. Beyonc\u00e9 posted the photos on her website, along with about 60 others chronicling her 37th year. She just turned 38 on September 4 (a Virgo, if that wasn\u2019t already obvious from her meticulous costumes). \u201cThank you from the depths of me for all my birthday loving,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 wrote in a note on her site. \u201cI had an incredible Bday! I\u2019m grateful for every breath. I thank God for all of my blessings, my wins, and my losses. I thank God for all of you! I would have posted earlier but I had work to do. I gotta job baaaaby. Here is your B at 37.\u201d Look at her. It\u2019s her birthday, yet we receive the gifts. Everybody say thank you to Mrs. Knowles-Carter.", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 posted new photos from the past year, including ones where she dressed up like Lisa Bonet and holding Sir and Rumi.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/20/20-beyonce.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
