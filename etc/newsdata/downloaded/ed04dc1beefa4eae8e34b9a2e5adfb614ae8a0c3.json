So I was signaling \u2014 and I haven\u2019t done it just to SpaceX but to all of our contractors \u2014 that we need more realism built into the development timelines,\u201d he said.\n\nSpaceX is developing a capsule under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program to launch astronauts to the international space station so that the U.S. does not have to rely on Russian rockets and spacecraft.\n\nBut last month Musk staged a big event to show off a prototype of an unrelated rocket he calls the Starship.\n\nBridenstine tweeted ahead of time that the commercial crew program is years behind schedule and NASA \u201cexpects to see the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American people. It\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d\n\nMusk responded during his Starship reveal that SpaceX resources are overwhelmingly focused on the Dragon crew capsule and the Falcon rocket that will launch it.\n\nDuring the press conference, Musk said SpaceX was within 1% of the commercial crew program budget.\n\n\u201cThe NASA request for commercial crew for several years was substantially reduced by Congress, I think in some cases by 50%,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to stay on schedule if you\u2019ve got half as much money, but we didn\u2019t spend more money, it just took longer.\u201d\n\nBoeing BA, -1.06% is also developing a capsule called Starliner under the commercial crew program.", "description": "NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said Thursday that a recent Twitter statement critical of SpaceX was a signal to all the space agency\u2019s contractors about...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT112_spacex_ZG_20191010205716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
