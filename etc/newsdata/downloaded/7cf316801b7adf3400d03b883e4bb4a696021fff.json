Another defendant, Henry Schein Medical, reached a settlement worth $1.25 million, the Post report said.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, CVS Pharmacy, Walmart, Winn Dixie and multiple individual physicians are also named as defendants in the federal lawsuit.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dan Polster of the Northern District of Ohio will oversee the consolidated lawsuit known as the National Prescription Opiate Litigation, which combines more than 2,000 pending cases with northern Ohio\u2019s Summit and Cuyahoga counties \u2014 which cover major cities Cleveland and Akron \u2014 serving as the plaintiffs.\n\nExperts say the trial Monday is a bellwether case \u2014 and the first in a large and complex web of litigation involving some of the largest U.S. drug makers and a crisis that has contributed to tens of thousands of lives \u2014 in which the defendants and plaintiffs will test arguments and determine the amount of money at stake as they work toward a settlement.\n\nOne of the original defendants, Johnson & Johnson, said earlier this month it also reached a $20.4 million settlement agreement with two Ohio counties listed as plaintiffs in the case. Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has filed for bankruptcy as part of a settlement deal. However, both agreements still need final approval.\n\nThe defendants are accused of fueling the opioid crisis by aggressively marketing narcotic drugs and downplaying the risks of overdose and addiction. National distributors, meanwhile, failed to take action on suspicious orders, plaintiffs argue.\n\nThe drug companies deny accusations that they worked in concert to market the drugs, arguing that they complied with federal regulations and delivered legitimate medications to patients experiencing painful conditions, such as cancer.\n\nPlaintiffs are seeking compensation to recoup sums of money governments have spent on healthcare and criminal issues since the onset of the crisis, which has totaled more than $500 billion, according to some counts.", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 Several drug companies reached a last-minute settlement with federal prosecutors Monday to avoid going to trial in a legal fight to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
