Coming within minutes of each other, the explosions caused panic as people tried to flee the city centre. Despite a major security crackdown recently after a number of high profile strikes, the bombs struck at the heart of the Iraqi capital\u2019s government district. One explosion hit a temporary building being used by Iraq\u2019s Finance Ministry. It\u2019s main premises were devastated by a bombing in August. Rather than frequent attacks on soft targets such as markets and mosques, today\u2019s blasts appear to suggest militants have shifted their focus to more large-scale strikes. Whatever the case, it\u2019s a brutal reminder of the potency of Iraq\u2019s stubborn insurgency and is likely to undermine the sense of security ahead of next year\u2019s elections and an auction of oilfield contracts due this weekend.", "description": "Scores of people have been killed after a series of suicide bombings in Baghdad.  \n\n News agency reports say at least a 112 people have died and more", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/archive/1000x563_archive.jpg", "published_at": "2009-12-08"}
