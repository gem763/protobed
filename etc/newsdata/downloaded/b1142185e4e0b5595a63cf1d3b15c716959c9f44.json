It is believed they may have used these tunnels to move gold around during the campaign.\n\nEver since the demise of the order in the 1300s, treasure hunters have looked for the mythical gold they may have left behind.\n\nA National Geographic documentary followed a team of archaeologists led by American explorer Dr Albert Lin as they used cutting edge technology to unearth the tunnels beneath Acre \u2013 one of the last known headquarters of the order.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nJacques de Molay, last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, was ordered burned at the stake by King Philip IV of France (Photo by Stefano Bianchetti/Corbis via Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m in Israel in search of the Knights Templar.

They scanned the fortress footprint and recreated the Templar HQ with impressive 3D models.
