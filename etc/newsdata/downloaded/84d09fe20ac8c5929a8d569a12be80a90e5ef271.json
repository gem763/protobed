'If u are a victim or have info re: a sex harassment situation at NBC - whether you've filed a claim or not - Silence Breakers confirms it is offering confidential support: silencebreakertime@gmail.com\n\nKelly's tweet comes a year after she was fired from NBC for making controversial comments about blackface - and she appears to be taking a keen interest in the current crisis plaguing her former network.\n\nAfter sharing the contact details for ex-staffers, Kelly couldn't resist taking a potshot at NBC, penning another tweet which read: 'Also, wouldn't it be nice if NBC would hire an outside investigator so Silence Breakers and the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund didn't have to do all of this?'\n\nMegyn Kelly sent out a series of tweets on Tuesday night pleading for former NBC employees who experienced sexual harassment to come forward and share their stories. She is pictured presenting on the network in October 2018 - just before her high-profile dismissal\n\nThe 48-year-old took to Twitter on Tuesday evening to relay the contact details of an organization offering support to ex-staffers, after the network agreed to release employees from non-disclosure agreements. She also retweeted a post from The LA Times which seemed to hint that she supported the firing of NBC News president Noah Oppenheim\n\nLate last week, she also retweeted a post from The Los Angeles Times, in which they reported that '20,000 had signed a petition calling for the firing of NBC News President Noah Oppenheim because of 'troubling reports' of his role to 'cover up abuse.'\n\nOppenheim and other NBC executives have come under fire in recent weeks following the release of Ronan Farrow's book Catch and Kill. In the explosive tell-all, the journalist asserts that those execs gave 'enhanced severance payouts' to victims of sexual harassment in exchange for their silence.\n\nIn the wake of the outrage, NBCUniversal last week agreed to release former staffers from their non-disclosure agreements.\n\nThe company released a statement last Friday saying: 'Any former NBC News employee who believes that they cannot disclose their experience with sexual harassment as a result of a confidentiality or non-disparagement provision in their separation agreement should contact NBCUniversal and we will release them from that perceived obligation'.\n\nKelly called for the network to do just that during an appearance on Fox News on October 16.\n\nKelly spoke about the NBC scandal during an appearance on Fox News on October 16\n\nIn the interview, she also theorized that some of the enhanced severance payouts may have been given to women who were harassed by NBC star Matt Lauer- who was terminated due to misconduct allegations in late 2017.\n\n'The number one thing that needs to happen now is they need to release any and all Matt Lauer accusers from their confidentiality agreements. NBC says it has nothing to hide. Great. Let's not hide anything,' said Kelly.\n\n'Show us all of the agreements, the enhanced severance agreements reached or at least the number so we can see which ones pop out and which ones are super high. Are they all women? Do they all have a connection with Matt Lauer? Release the women from their confidentiality obligations.'\n\nShe also hit out at the network for not allowing an external investigation of sexual misconduct claims, something that both Fox News and CBS did after claims of sexual misconduct and abuse of power came to light at their networks.\n\nIn the interview, she also theorized that some of the enhanced severance payouts may have been given to women who were harassed by NBC star Matt Lauer- who was terminated due to misconduct allegations in late 2017\n\n'There's a question of the faith and confidence of the public and the reporting of NBC on matters involving itself. To me as a lawyer, it's just always better if you send it outside,' said Kelly.\n\n'Then people can have more faith in it and if there's nothing to hide, you have no worries about it. You have nothing to worry about.'\n\nFormer NBC stars: Kelly and Lauer pictured together at NBC in 2017. Lauer was fired for sexual misconduct allegations in late 2017, while Megyn was axed for controversial comments the following year\n\nKelly's interest in the scandal at NBC may not be motivated by vengeance, but rather by the fact that she herself was a victim of sexual harassment whilst working at Fox News.\n\nThe blonde anchor helped bring about a sea change at Fox, which led to the ousting of top boss, Roger Ailes.\n\nMeanwhile, rumours are circulating Kelly could soon be back on the air, a year after she was unceremoniously dumped from NBC just thirteen months into her three-year contract.\n\nThe savvy star fueled speculation she is working on a new project with Rose McGowan over the weekend, sharing a selfie to Twitter with the high-profile Harvey Weinstein accuser.\n\n'Brainstorming,' Kelly cryptically wrote beneath the image.", "description": "The 48-year-old took to Twitter on Tuesday to relay the contact details of an organization offering  legal and emotional support to ex-staffers.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/04/20309460-0-image-a-64_1572321743998.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
