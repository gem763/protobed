While that now seems unlikely, Sadr is still able to mobilise his followers, who have previously paralysed the country with sit-ins.\n\nThe former militia leader turned anti-corruption figurehead could again be forced to call for street protests if he faces blowback in parliament.\n\nThe Hashed\u2019s political arm Fatah could push to dismiss Sadr\u2019s 54 deputies and four ministers.\n\nIf Sadr were sent into opposition, he would join other pro-reform Shiites leaders, including former prime minister Haider al-Abadi and Ammar al-Hakim.\n\nIn the short-term, Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi\u2019s government looks likely to survive following promises of a cabinet reshuffle and lawsuits against corruption.\n\nBut an absence of radical reforms will only exacerbate the problems in Iraq, experts say, in a country ravaged by four decades of conflict and ranked as the 12th most corrupt in the world.\n\nAuthorities used \u201cmuch more stick than carrot\u201d in quelling the unrest, Haddad noted.\n\nThe reforms offered up to protesters following an emergency cabinet meeting \u201cjust betrays a rentier mentality all over again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUsing oil wealth \u2014 which they don\u2019t really have at the moment given the budget deficit \u2014 to buy the acquiescence of the people.\u201d\n\nThis response is not indicative of \u201ca political class who have received a wakeup call,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it should be.\u201d", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Deadly protests in Iraq have exposed a rift within the country\u2019s Shiite political factions benefiting hardliners ready to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/148923_week-violent-protests-in-iraq-hardline-shiite-factions-in-baghdad-are-consolidate-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
