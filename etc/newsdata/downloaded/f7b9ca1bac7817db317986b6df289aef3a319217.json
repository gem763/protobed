But his comments suggested a smaller \u201csafe zone\u201d than Ankara has demanded, underscoring the ambiguities in the American-Turkish deal.\n\nMazloum Abdi, speaking on Kurdish Ronahi TV, said the extent of the cease-fire stretches about 100 kilometers (60 miles) along the middle of the border \u2014 between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. That is the region where Turkey has largely made its gains in nine days of fighting.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this cease fire will be successful, and we will do our best to make it successful,\u201d Abdi said Thursday, describing it as a \u201ctentative agreement.\u201d Abdi is also known by his nom de guerre, Mazloum Kobani.\n\nAbdi also did not specify that his fighters would withdraw from any territory. Kurdish fighters have already been driven out of much \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the area he defined. But they are still entrenched in Ras al-Ayn, fiercely battling Turkish-backed Syrian fighters trying to take the town. Whether the Kurdish fighters pull out of Ras al-Ayn will likely be an early test of the accord.\n\nTurkey demands that all Kurdish fighters pull out of a zone stretching the entire length of the border from the Euphrates River to Iraq, more than 400 kilometers (250 miles). That covers most of the region were Syria\u2019s Kurdish population is concentrated.\n\nThe Kurdish-led forces still hold the rest of that territory and have invited the Syrian government\u2019s military, backed by Russia, to deploy there to protect them from Turkey. Syrian troops have already rolled into several key points along the border.\n\nA key question for the ceasefire going forward is whether Ankara will be satisfied that the Syrian government presence is enough to keep a lid on the Kurdish-led forces.\n\nTurkey launched its invasion nine days ago, after President Donald Trump pulled out American soldiers in northeast Syria who had been working alongside the Kurds. Abandoned by their U.S. allies \u2014 with whom they had fought to bring down the Islamic State group \u2014 the Kurds turned to Russia and Damascus for help.\n\nThe cease-fire announced by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, sent by Trump to Ankara, appeared to be a significant embrace of Turkey\u2019s position in the weeklong conflict. It calls for a five-day cease-fire in the Turks\u2019 attacks on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria to allow the Kurds to withdraw to roughly 20 miles away from the Turkish border.\n\nAbdi, the Kurdish commander, made sure to praise Trump in his comments, saying \u201cthe president of the United States was directly involved and online.\u201d\n\nHe suggested the Kurdish-led force was involved in working out the cease-fire deal. \u201cIt has been three days that we have been working on this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were aware of all details. As result we reached this agreement.\u201d\n\nThe deal raises hopes for at least a pause in the chaos that the Turkish assault has wreaked across northeast Syria.\n\nThe nine-day offensive has left many civilians dead on both sides. The Kurdish health authority said 218 civilians, including 18 children and five medical personnel, have been killed. At least 20 Turkish civilians and six soldiers were killed. The Observatory said at least 203 fighters from the Kurdish-led forces and 171 from Turkish-backed Syrian factions have been killed.\n\nMore than 130,000 people were driven from their homes. Abdi said there were provisions in the ceasefire for the return of the displaced.\n\nAfter the announcement of the cease-fire, sporadic Turkish shelling still hit the border town of Ras al-Ayn, while a relative calm held elsewhere, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor. It also said 20 people were wounded by celebratory gunfire in Qamishli, a Kurdish majority city.\n\nRas al-Ayn has been the scene of the fiercest fighting of past days, with Kurdish fighters there putting up powerful resistance despite Turkish claims to have captured it. Amid heavy bombardment by the Turkish military, Turkish-backed Syrian fighters encircled the town\n\nThe Kurdish Red Crescent said its ambulances and field clinics in the town have been targeted by shelling, making it hard for them to reach the wounded and killing at least one medic.\n\n\u201cWe need a safe corridor to facilitate the evacuation of the wounded,\u201d the Kurdish Red Crescent posted on its Facebook page.\n\n___\n\nMroue reported from Beirut.
