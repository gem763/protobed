However, after Mrs Palmer contracted pneumonia around 10 days previous to that, she was admitted to a Turkish hospital where, despite an initial improvement, she remained until her death.\n\nThe family has said the hospital that cared for Mrs Palmer will not release her body until they have received as much as \u00a315,000 in unpaid medical bills, a situation that they have described as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d.\n\nThe family\u2019s efforts had already raised more than \u00a33,000 by the time of Mrs Palmer\u2019s death, and they have offered any donors the opportunity to reclaim their donation. However, they are keeping the fundraising page open in the hope they can afford to arrange for Mrs Palmer\u2019s body to be repatriated, so that she can be laid to rest in her home town.\n\n\"We would like to say thank you to every single person who donated and sent messages of support,\u201d added granddaughter Michaela.\n\n\"Every share meant that someone else heard our campaign and although we didn\u2019t manage to bring her home, we came so very close.\n\n\"As a family, we would like to offer all our donors the opportunity to withdraw their donation, so please get in touch is you wish to do so. However, any money that remains will be used towards the cost of bringing my Grandmother home to rest and to make a small dent in the medical bills.\u201d\n\n(Image: Media Wales)\n\nMrs Palmer had three children - Andrew, Jackie and Jason - with her husband Gwyn, whom she married almost six decades ago.\n\nIn a statement, they said: \u201cSadly, we have lost a very important member of our family.\n\n\"Mam and Dad were married for 59 years and were rarely apart. She always had a smile on her face but also ruled the roost when needed.\n\n\"Mam came from a large family and we have lots of memories of family celebrations, especially at Christmas time. Mam was a gifted seamstress and made a lot of her own clothes, as well as her daughter\u2019s and her granddaughter\u2019s s wedding dresses.\n\n\"Mam always loved being part of the family and will be sadly missed. She will always be in our hearts.\"", "description": "Gwyneth Palmer, 77, died this weekend after falling ill abroad while on holiday with her husband", "authors": ["Robert Harries", "Image", "Media Wales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580383.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MEDIA-WALES-Gwyneth-Palmer-02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
