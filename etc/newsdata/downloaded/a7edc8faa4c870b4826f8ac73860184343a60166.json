He started with a weekly podcast, followed by his first major interview with The New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer and then this week\u2019s announcement that he will be joining SiriusXM to host a weekly radio show and help cover the 2020 election.\n\nAnd on Thursday night, Franken sat down for his first late-night appearance since leaving the Senate with his old friend and former Saturday Night Live colleague Conan O\u2019Brien.\n\n\u201cWe have a great deal to talk about,\u201d O\u2019Brien said while introducing his guest, and the host did not hesitate to get into the difficult questions at the top of the interview.\n\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement, I think we can all agree, has brought to light a lot of offensive behavior by a lot of men and rightfully so and has been to the great good,\u201d O\u2019Brien began. \u201cMany people think that your case\u2014it made them feel uneasy, and there was some questions and uneasiness about your particular situation and how it was resolved.\u201d Referring specifically to the several Democratic senators who now say they regret pushing Franken out, he asked, \u201cIs this a watershed moment for you?\u201d\n\nFranken said it was \u201cvery gratifying\u201d for him to get an apology from his former colleagues, adding, \u201cThey just basically all said that I deserved due process. And I believe I did too.\u201d\n\nWhy then, O\u2019Brien wanted to know, did Franken resign on his own volition instead of fighting to clear his name.\n\n\u201cI don't want to name any names, but, you know, my committee work would be at risk. I mean, basically losing that,\u201d Franken said. \u201cMy staff would be isolated. And I just couldn't serve the people of Minnesota. But, you know, it really needed to have a process, but I just couldn't stay either. It was awful. There were no good choices.\u201d He said he felt a \u201ctremendous amount of pressure\u201d to walk away and ultimately didn\u2019t think he had \u201cany other choice\u201d but to do so.\n\nAsked what he\u2019s learned from the experience, Franken said, \u201cWhen this first happened, if you had asked me, \u2018Have you ever made a woman feel uncomfortable by the way you put your arm around her or touched her or something like that\u2019 I would have said no. And after all these allegations came in, I thought, well, I must be doing something wrong. Right? Ever since, I've been a lot more mindful in my interactions with pretty much everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who know me know that I'm not that guy,\u201d he added. \u201cThat guy that 36 of my colleagues demanded that I go and the pressure came on me in no uncertain terms that I had to go.\u201d\n\nOverall, O\u2019Brien was just about as sympathetic an interviewer as Franken could have asked for, going on to praise him for being a \u201creally effective, hard-working senator\u201d and expressing how much he believes he\u2019s missed now that the country is on the verge of impeachment hearings.\n\nDespite his return to a career in radio, Franken clearly misses his old job as well. Asked by O\u2019Brien if he ever finds himself \u201cyelling at the screen\u201d during Senate hearings \u201cbecause you have the right idea for the question and the person on the screen is not asking that question,\u201d he took a long pause before replying, \u201cYes. Yes, that happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very frustrating,\u201d Franken added, revealing that he\u2019s gone so far as to email former colleagues in the middle of hearings with his suggestions.\n\n\u201cWhen I left the Senate, I said I'm giving up my seat, I'm not giving up my voice,\u201d Franken told O\u2019Brien before promoting his new SiriusXM show, where he\u2019ll have a lot less power than he once did but plenty of space to express his opinions.", "description": "In his first late-night appearance since leaving the Senate, Al Franken told Conan O\u2019Brien that he \u201cdeserved due process\u201d in his #MeToo ouster.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_715,w_1271,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569557206/thumbnail_AF_vd8eza", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
