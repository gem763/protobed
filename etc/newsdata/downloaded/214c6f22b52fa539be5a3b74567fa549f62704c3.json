In return, Tribble used her authority to pressure PREPA and FEMA officials to secure further contracts for recovery efforts for COBRA and accelerate payments to Ellison's company.\n\nCobra was awarded two contracts worth about $1.8 billion combined, according to court documents filed on Sept. 3.\n\nIn addition, prosecutors allege Ellison used his clout to hire Tribble's friend, Jovanda Patterson, at one of Cobra's affiliated companies. Patterson became FEMA's deputy chief of staff in Puerto Rico before she resigned in July 2018 to work for Cobra Energy LLC, according to the indictment. Cobra Acquisitions and Cobra Energy are subsidiaries of Oklahoma City-based Mammoth Energy Services Inc. Patterson is the third person charged in the indictment.\n\nProsecutors allege Patterson defrauded Cobra by telling them her salary with FEMA was far larger than it was, enabling her to secure a $160,000 a year salary at Cobra.\n\n\u201cThese defendants were supposed to come to Puerto Rico to help during the recovery after the devastation suffered from Hurricane Mar\u00eda,\" Rodr\u00edguez said in a statement. \"Instead, they decided to take advantage of the precarious conditions of our electric power grid and engaged in a bribery and honest services wire fraud scheme in order to enrich themselves illegally.\"\n\nAll three defendants went to Puerto Rico in Oct. 2017, just one month after the deadly Category 5 hurricane killed nearly 3,000 people and caused the world's second-longest blackout.\n\n\u201cAll government officials are entrusted with performing their duties honestly and ethically. The charged offenses are reprehensible, more so in light of PREPA\u2019s and Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal crisis,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\nFEMA said in a statement Tuesday that they \"cannot comment on personnel matters; however, the Agency is fully cooperating with federal investigators.\"\n\n\"FEMA\u2019s mission is to help the American people before, during, and after disasters and our mission can only be accomplished by maintaining the public trust and confidence of those we serve,\" the organization said. \"As such, the Agency takes allegations of employee misconduct extremely seriously and holds all employees to the highest ethical standards \u2013 requiring them to protect government resources and place public service over private gain in everything they do.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe three are facing 15 criminal counts including conspiracy by public officials to commit bribery, acts affecting a personal financial interest, providing false statements, disaster fraud, wire fraud and Travel Act violations. If convicted, they could each face up to 5 years in prison for conspiracy, travel act violations, conflict of interest and false statements and up to 30 years for honest services wire fraud and disaster fraud.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Federal authorities announced Tuesday that two former officials from the\u00a0Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA),\u00a0as well as the former president of the main relief contracting agency in Puerto Rico, have been arrested and indicted on charges of\u00a0taking bribes during restoration efforts after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
