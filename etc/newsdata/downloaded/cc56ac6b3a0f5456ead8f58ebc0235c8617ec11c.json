Were you ever aware? THE VICE PRESIDENT: I \u2015 what \u2015 I never discussed the issue of \u2015 the issue of the Bidens with President Zelensky and \u2015 Q: But within the administration, were you ever aware, within the administration? THE VICE PRESIDENT: What I can tell you is that all of our discussions internally \u2015 I mean the President and our team and our contacts, in my office, with Ukraine \u2015 were entirely focused on the broader issues of the lack of European support and corruption.

THE VICE PRESIDENT: \u2015 about the issue that former Vice President Biden had his son on the board of a major energy company in Ukraine at a time that Vice President Biden was running the United States\u2019 efforts in Ukraine. I think the American people have a right to know what was going on. And \u2015 but all of our discussions, all of my discussions with the leadership in Ukraine was entirely focused on President Trump\u2019s priority of supporting (inaudible) ...\n\nIf Pence did know that Trump had pressed Ukraine\u2019s president to dig up dirt on Biden, that would mean he knew that Trump had potentially committed a federal crime and done nothing about it.\n\nIt is illegal for anyone, including the president of the United States, to solicit anything of value from a foreign national that relates to a U.S. election. Federal Elections Chair Ellen Weintraub recently reiterated this point on Twitter.\n\n\u201cLet me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office,\u201d Weintraub said in a statement. \u201cIt is illegal for any person to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above to see Pence dodge the question about what he knew.\n\nRelated coverage\n\nWhite House Refuses To Cooperate With Impeachment Inquiry; Constitutional Crisis Looms\n\nTrump Is Flailing.
