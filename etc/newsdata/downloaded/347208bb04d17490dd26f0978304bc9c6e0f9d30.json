Villagers formed the 'war cabinet' need to raise \u00a3580,000 to buy The White House, previously frequented by the former PM\n\nThe White House is still open as usual, at least until the current tenancy ends in April. It benefits from trade from visitors to Churchill's grave and nearby Blenheim, where he was born\n\nPub chain Greene King is selling The White House in Bladon, the village in which Churchill is buried, and residents fear it could close if it falls into the hands of developers.\n\nIt is on the market for \u00a3495,000, and the community has six months to raise the money before any other offers are considered.\n\nBladon resident Rachel Guest, who is on the pub's community committee, said: 'The White House has been at the heart of the Bladon community since the 16th century, and is our last remaining pub and community facility.\n\n'It's also the pub where Churchill 'learned to drink' during his time in Blenheim Palace.\n\nCurrent owners Greene King are selling the property as a pub but residents fear it could be converted into flats.\n\nCampaigner Clare Edwards said: 'There is nothing to stop a potential purchaser buying it, leaving it open as a pub for a few weeks, shutting it, and applying for a change of use.'\n\nResidents have six months to raise the \u00a3580,000 needed to buy the 16th Century pub and have so far collected more than \u00a3110,000.\n\nBladon resident Rachel Guest, who is on the pub's community committee said: 'The White House has been at the heart of the Bladon community since the 16th century, and is our last remaining pub and community facility.

They hope to be able to save the Churchill's old drinking hole\n\nSir Winston is buried at St Martin's Churchyard in Bladon Mike Edwards, of Bladon Community Pub Committee, said: 'To quote Sir Winston, we plan to 'never give in, never give in'.'\n\nHe said residents had followed the example of the pub's 'most revered patron' by forming 'our own war cabinet' to keep 'this Churchillian centre to our village open'.\n\nSir Winston was born at the nearby Blenheim Palace, and was buried at St Martin's Churchyard in the village.\n\nRandolph Churchill said: 'Our family is very proud of our association with Bladon and the love and care the community gives towards my great grandfather's resting place.'\n\nHe said the plans had the 'family's blessing'.\n\nThe White House is still open as usual, at least until the current tenancy ends in April. It benefits from trade from visitors to Churchill's grave and nearby Blenheim, where he was born.\n\nIn June, after hearing murmurings about a potential sale, Bladon Parish Council succeeded in getting the pub listed as an asset of community value.\n\nThis means the owners have to give six months to allow locals the chance to bid for it, before putting it on the open market.\n\nOxfordshire County Council leader Ian Hudspeth, who has lived in Bladon for 24 years, said the pub is a hub of the village community.\n\nHe told the Oxford Mail: 'The community does not want to lose this asset and is working together to ensure that for future generations there is a pub in Bladon.\n\n'It will not be an easy task as there needs to be a group of committed individuals who drive this project forward, with the village all working together to raise funds.\n\n'There is amazing potential for the White House to be more than just a pub, as we lost the village shop many years ago.'\n\nMr Hudspeth said the village will miss the pub's current landlord Kevin McEneaney, particularly his 'excellent food and Sunday roasts.'\n\nMr McEneaney told the Oxford Mail he fully supported villagers' hopes to take the pub over, and approached the parish council about making it a community asset.\n\nHe said: 'I wish whoever buys the pub the best of luck. I hope I never see a house on here, it's important that this village has a pub - it's part of the identity of the village. If the villagers raise enough money to buy it, that's fantastic.'\n\nA community meeting was held in the village last week where people were asked to discuss options and express interest in becoming a shareholder.\n\nThe group is being helped by the Woodstock-based Plunkett Foundation, which will support them to develop a business plan and make it a success as they already have for other community pubs.\n\nA Greene King spokesperson said: 'We appreciate the importance of the pub to the Bladon community and are offering the property for sale as a public house with the benefit of the premises licence.\n\n'We will carry out a thorough and fair process to agree a sale when we have received bids from all interested parties.'", "description": "Residents of Bladon, West Oxfordshire have joined forces in a bid to buy the pub where legendary wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill frequented as a young man.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/15/20248156-0-image-a-19_1572191335723.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
