Researchers from the University of Zurich looked at nationally representative survey results over that period from 12,000 men and 18,000 women. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Gender & Society.\n\nIn the 1980s, moms were less satisfied with their lives than childless women, but that \u201cmaternal happiness gap\u201d has closed, researchers found. Women with or without children reported the same levels of life satisfaction. And though dads are taking on more child-care duties, men who have kids are just as happy as their childless counterparts, and their life satisfaction has improved, the researchers found.\n\nResearchers attributed parents\u2019 increased happiness to mothers and fathers sharing child-care duties and to Germany\u2019s parental-leave policies. \u201cThese family-friendly political measures are not only significant for equality between the sexes,\u201d said lead author Klaus Preisner. \u201cThey are just as important for their role in improving life satisfaction of parents and thus ultimately of children.\u201d\n\nTime with the baby \u2014 and a paycheck\n\nMothers in Germany get six weeks of leave before birth and eight weeks after their child is born \u2014 all at their full salary, according to Working Mother magazine. On top of that, both moms and dads can take up to 24 months of paid parental leave between a child\u2019s third and eighth birthdays.\n\nWorking parents in the U.S. are significantly more constrained. Federal law mandates that companies with 50 or more employees provide 12 weeks of leave during the first year of a baby\u2019s life, but it\u2019s not paid. About 66% of American workers have access to paid leave, according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSee also: The real reason companies like Target are offering paid parental leave and child care\n\nThe cost of child care\n\nGermans families also have access to subsidized child care, the researchers noted, which \u201cmakes it easier for families to combine parenthood and employment.\u201d One 2018 study found that wealthier households in Germany spent on average 5% of their post-tax income on child care, while the lowest-income families spent 10%. In the U.S., families spent a minimum of 6.6% of their income on child care, and up to 17.2% in places where it\u2019s most expensive, according to Child Care Aware.\n\nHow U.S. parents split household work\n\nAmericans families also have a ways to go in divvying up domestic chores: women who work full-time spend more hours in their day tending to children, cooking, and grocery shopping than men who work full-time, according to the 2018 American Time Use Survey from the BLS. Men spend more time working and on sports and leisure activities than women do. Women spend more time on \u201cpersonal care, including sleep\u201d than men do.\n\nSee also: Giving this one free gift to your wife should transform your marriage\n\nWorking parents feel they\u2019re falling short with their kids and on the job\n\nAbout half of working parents in the U.S. \u2014 53% of moms and 51% of dads \u2014 say being a working parent makes it more difficult for them to be a good parent, a recent Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data showed.\n\nA similar percentage of working mothers (54%) say they\u2019ve had to cut their work hours and 51% say \u201cthey\u2019ve felt like they couldn\u2019t give 100% at work,\u201d Pew found. That compares to about 44% of dads who have had to reduce their working hours, and 43% feeling that they couldn\u2019t give their all.\n\n\u201cDespite these challenges, many working parents \u2014 including about eight-in-ten full-time working mothers \u2014 say their current employment situation is what\u2019s best for them at this point in their life,\u201d Pew found. The analysis didn\u2019t indicate whether parents came to this conclusion by choice or because of financial necessity.", "description": "Moms in the U.S. who work full-time spend more hours on domestic chores than working dads.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS989_dad_ba_ZG_20191009135519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
