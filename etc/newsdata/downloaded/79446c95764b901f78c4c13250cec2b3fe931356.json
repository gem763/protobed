He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nTrump's tweet follows a New York Times report that a former male classmate alleges that he saw Kavanaugh expose himself and place his genitals against a woman without her consent at Yale.\n\nThis allegation had previously not been released to the public but was made known to the FBI during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearing last fall, according to the Times, which also said the the incident was not investigated by the FBI.\n\nKavanaugh was narrowly confirmed on a 50-48 vote after an intense confirmation process that featured emotional testimony from Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the justice's accusers of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe justice has denied all accusations of wrongdoing, and has maintained they are politically motivated. He refused to talk to the Times about the latest allegation on Saturday.\n\nTrump also issued a follow-up tweet that Kavanaugh \"should start suing people for liable\" and that \"the Justice Department should come to his rescue.\" He later deleted it and issued a tweet with \"libel\" spelled correctly.\n\n\"The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop?\" Trump asked. \"They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\"", "description": "President Trump said in a tweet Sunday that \"Radical Left Democrats\" and the \"LameStream Media\" are trying to slander Justice Brett Kavanaugh into \"turning Liberal.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/06fa679/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1060x557+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F1f%2F1a%2Fdb16e18f44fca7211df8f906add4%2Fap-18191067166450.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
