In a series of tweets Monday evening, Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination, said Facebook allowed President Trump to spread false information widely, and called on the company to take down the attack ad against Mr. Biden, one of her top rivals.\n\n\u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy \u2014 allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote.\n\nFacebook declined to comment.\n\nThe ad the Biden campaign asked Facebook to take down, released by the Trump campaign on Sept. 27, starts with staticky shots of Mr. Biden meeting with Ukrainian officials during his time in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d a narrator says, using video from an event in which Mr. Biden mentions the money. \u201cBut when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him.\u201d\n\nThe $1 billion figure was mentioned at an event in 2018 at the Council on Foreign Relations, in which Mr. Biden was talking about how the Obama administration tried to root out corruption in Ukraine. He said he had held back financial aid to push the country to make reforms.\n\nThere is no evidence that Mr. Biden, during his time as vice president, pushed for the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor general to help his son Hunter Biden. The former vice president, along with other members of the Obama administration and other international leaders, pushed for the removal of the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because of accusations that he ignored corruption.\n\nDays after the ad was broadcast on television and social networks the Biden campaign wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, asking to reject the ad. The video \u201cspreads false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories regarding Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Greg Schultz, a Biden campaign manager, wrote to the Facebook leaders.", "description": "The company\u2019s handling of a Trump campaign ad with unsubstantiated accusations about Joseph Biden foreshadows a continuing fight over misinformation.", "authors": ["Cecilia Kang"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/business/00facebook/00facebook-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
