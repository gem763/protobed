The bearish descending triangle formation was bound to break out to the downside so it has been no real surprise. What the move has revealed however is huge price discrepancies between various crypto exchanges.\n\nBitcoin Premiums Abound\n\nThe digital dust appears to be settling following bitcoin\u2019s $1,500 dollar dump a few hours ago. A cascade of sell signals were triggered as soon as the asset fell through support at $9,500. This created a massive red hourly candle dumping $900 in just 60 minutes. The panic continued as BTC fell further touching long term support at $8,000 before a wall of buy orders were executed pushing it back up $500.\n\nAt the time of writing buyers were not able to overcome the $8,500 newly formed resistance zone and analysts were predicting further losses. What emerged during that tumultuous couple of hours were wildly varying prices on different exchanges around the world.\n\nCrypto trader \u2018hodlonaut\u2019 noted a lot of action on Coinbase;\n\n\u201cSomeone is accumulating like crazy on Coinbase. Huge buying at huge premium\u201d\n\nSomeone is accumulating like crazy on Coinbase. Huge buying at huge premium \u2014 hodlonaut\ud83c\udf2e\u26a1\ud83d\udd11 (@hodlonaut) September 24, 2019\n\nAnalyst Josh Rager confirmed the Coinbase premium.\n\n$BTC $400 to $500 premium on Coinbase \u2014 Josh Rager \ud83d\udcc8 (@Josh_Rager) September 24, 2019\n\nAnd fellow crypto expert Alex Kr\u00fcger also observed the huge spread between exchanges.\n\n\u201cWild $600 wide spreads between Bitmex and Coinbase. $8150 vs $8750\u201d\n\nWild $600 wide spreads between Bitmex and Coinbase. $8150 vs $8750 \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro) September 24, 2019\n\nCoinbase appeared to be the worst offender, but then it does have some of the highest fees in the industry and is more profit driven than other exchanges so hardly surprising.\n\nArbitrage between exchanges would have netted some tidy gains for those quick enough to react. It was also pointed out that discrepancies such as these are partially to blame for the lack of adoption for bitcoin. However, Satoshi did not have exchanges in mind when he designed the currency which was primarily supposed to be traded peer to peer.\n\nA few hours later things appear to have settled down between the exchanges with Tradingview.com reporting just $25 difference in prices between Bitstamp, Coinbase, Bitfinex, Bittrex and Gemini. On Japan\u2019s BitFlyer the price for BTC was a little higher at 926,799 JPY which worked out at $8,636.\n\nSpeculation as to why bitcoin dumped so hard today is growing at the moment. CNBC\u2019s Ran NeuNer remained perplexed.\n\nI\u2019m a member of multiple Crypto chats/WhatsApp groups (none paid)- Some of these chats have the biggest whales and crypto names in the market\u2026 and not a single person has any idea what happened today!\n\nOthers have fingered the FED flooding US cash markets, bitcoin hash rate crashing, and other technical signals concluding but the bottom line is this has happened before and will happen again.\n\nDid you take advantage of bitcoin premiums on exchanges?
