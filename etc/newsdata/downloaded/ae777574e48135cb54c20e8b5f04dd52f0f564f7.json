However, the sergeant broke loose and ran into the veld, chased by ACU members. In his bid to escape, the member ran into a highway and was killed after being hit by a truck.\"\n\nNational police commissioner General Khehla Sitole commended the unit for their swift action in responding to the incident.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the [officer] lost his life during the process of arrest and I extend heartfelt sympathies to the family of the deceased member. However, it is also rather disconcerting when one receives reports of members allegedly engaging in corrupt activities,\" Sitole said.\n\n\"We, members of the South African Police Service, have a constitutional and moral obligation to protect our institutions from being eroded by corruption.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
