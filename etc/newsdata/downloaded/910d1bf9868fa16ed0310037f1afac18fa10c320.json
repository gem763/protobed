I told him I wasn\u2019t sure about this week since it is a short week. He told me he was out of it at home and needed more.\"\n\nGoins texted her teacher friends who in turn purchased food.\n\nHer Facebook post was shared 17,000 times. Goins told \"Good Morning America\" she is \"overwhelmed\" by the outpouring of support.\n\n\"The support that our community and even those far away has been amazing,\" she told \"GMA.\" \"We [the teachers involved] believe it has opened eyes to those who are not in our schools every day. We love reading the comments from teachers who are doing similar things in their areas, that gives us hope in humanity.\"\n\nThat positive reaction has led to the establishment of a food pantry for the students at the school.\n\n\"We hope that people realize that teachers love their students,\" she said. \"Teaching is so much more than just teaching. We see more than a test score, we see the child. This is a very hard job, it is an emotional roller coaster at times, but we give our all to make sure that every child is successful.\"", "description": "Brooke Goins, a teacher at Jacksboro Elementary School in Jacksboro, Tennessee posted to Facebook about a student who was hungry.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191008teachergroceriesmain_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
