Rules are adapted to the circumstance.\n\n\u2018The only result that we were happy with was to award the prize this year to both.\n\n\u2018There are things they shared. They are both fully engaged novels. They address the world today.\u2019\n\n\u2018The Testaments\u2019 by Margaret Atwood (Picture: EPA)\n\nMr Florence said the jury was unanimous in its decision to rebel, a decision Booker literary director Gaby Wood said she respected, despite an order from foundation chairwoman Helena Kennedy that the rules must be honoured.\n\nShe said: \u2018It is always the jury\u2019s decision. I support the means by which the judges arrived at their decision.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t a fighting gesture. It was a generous one.\n\n\u2018If someone makes a revolutionary gesture, you have to accept it. You don\u2019t have to say, \u2018I agree with it\u2019.\u2019\n\nProlific Canadian author Atwood previously took home the prize in 2000 for her novel The Blind Assassin.\n\nShe has become the fourth person and the second woman to win the Booker twice, following Hilary Mantel, JM Coetzee and Peter Cary.\n\nMr Florence said The Testaments was \u2018beautiful in its depth.\n\n\u2018Girl, Woman, Other\u2019 by Bernardine Evaristo (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018Now it looks more politically urgent than ever. There is a need now to look at what complicity and what resilience and what resistance might look like.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritish author Evaristo has been hailed for her polyvocal work Girl, Woman, Other, which explores the nature of modern British womanhood.\n\nMr Florence said the book provided a \u2018wonderful spectrum of black British women today. This book is groundbreaking\u2019.\n\nThe Booker has been split twice before, between Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton in 1974, and again between Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth in 1992.\n\nRules were brought in following this to prevent future divisions of the prize.\n\nSir Salman Rushdie was shortlisted this year for his referential work Quichotte, along with Lucy Ellmann for Ducks, Newburyport, Chigozie Obioma for An Orchestra Of Minorities, and Elif Shafak for 10 Minutes 38 Seconds In This Strange World.\n\nThe jury was made up of Mr Florence, Liz Calder, novelist and film-maker Xiaolu Guo, writer and former barrister Afua Hirsch and composer Joanna MacGregor.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
