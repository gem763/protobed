He informed us that he was coming in. He didn\u2019t ask permission.\u201d He added that the United States simply did not have enough troops to stop a Turkish advance and they needed to be taken out of harm\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cThere is no way they could stop 15,000 Turks from proceeding south,\u201d he said.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5da3402aa2fe2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
