A decrease in orders for transportation equipment helped drive the overall decline. New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business investment, also decreased.\n\nHere are the report's takeaways:\n\n-Orders for durable goods-products designed to last at least three years-decreased 1.1% in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The decrease was greater than the forecast for a drop of 0.8% from economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n-Orders for transportation equipment saw some of the biggest month-over-month declines. Orders for auto vehicles and parts fell 1.6% in September from August, while orders for civilian aircraft and parts-which tend to be volatile-fell 11.8% from the previous month. Overall, orders excluding transportation still fell 0.3% in September from August.\n\n-Orders for August were up a revised 0.3% from July.\n\n-Orders for durable goods were down 0.8% in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period last year.\n\n-New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft-a closely watched proxy for business investment-fell 0.5% in September from August, to $68.6 billion. They were up 1.0% in January through September compared to the same period in 2018.\n\nWrite to Amara Omeokwe at amara.omeokwe@wsj.com and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
