Here she is after a bath. Mary Meisenzahl/Business Insider\n\nSmart baby monitors are increasingly becoming a must-have item for parents of young children.\n\nI, however, do not have any children, so I usually disregard pitches I get claiming that some monitor is disrupting the industry.\n\nBut I realized after a while I do have a use for a smart baby monitor: my pet hedgehog, Lola, is nocturnal. I decided to try the Summer Baby Pixel Zoom HD 5-inch Video Monitor to see if it worked for pet-tracking.\n\nIt was a great way to keep an eye on her at night, when she's most active.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nNot long after starting at Business Insider, I noticed that I was getting a weirdly high number of pitches about covering baby monitors. Did I accidentally get put on the wrong list? Were they confusing me with someone else? I don't know, but I thought I knew of at least one use for a baby monitor, if my editors would go for it.\n\nMy hedgehog, Lola, is like a baby in the sense that she is often cranky, and we maintain different sleep schedules. I don't strictly need to have a camera trained on her at night, but it had a strong possibility of being cute, so I went for it.\n\nHedgehogs are nocturnal, so I wanted a baby monitor capable of taking high-quality images in low light. This is especially important because Lola won't really wake up and do all her nighttime activities until it's almost pitch-black in my room. Once it is dark enough for her, she gets up almost immediately. Most nights, I close my curtains and turn off the lights, and hear her crunching on her food within minutes. Then, the rest of the night she alternates between running on her wheel (a hilarious sight), eating, drinking, and sleeping \u2014 the good life, basically.\n\nIt's surprisingly hard to get look at Lola on her wheel \u2014 as soon as there's even a little bit of light, or she hears you come by her cage, she freezes or runs to hide in her igloo.\n\nTo keep an eye on Lola at night, I requested a review model of the Summer Baby Pixel Zoom HD, and mounted it to the side of her cage. This model comes with some pretty cool features that I was excited to try:\n\nRemote steering, up to 300 degrees left and right and 125 degrees up and down\n\nSleepZone virtual boundary \u2014 you can set a boundary around a certain area and get an alert if your baby (hedgehog) moves outside the area\n\nTwo-way talk back and lullabies, meaning I can start talking to her and watch her freeze on her wheel\n\nMoonlite night vision, which can temporarily illuminate the camera.\n\nHere are the results.", "description": "Brands kept pitching me baby monitors, but I don't have a baby.
