The National Consumer Law Center is a nonprofit that advocates for consumers\u2019 rights on issues ranging from bankruptcy to debt collection.\n\n\u201cI have to ask whether they don\u2019t want the public to know about it,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, the National Consumer Law Center\u2019s associate director. Saunders heard about the database several days ago because of her own Google GOOG, +0.76% alert.\n\nThe CFPB didn\u2019t have to set up the database, she acknowledged. But given the value of the information, \u201cit would have been nice\u201d if the agency had publicized it more, Saunders said.\n\nThe CFPB didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPrepaid cards and payroll cards have funds loaded on them from the start and can be helpful for people without a checking account. Nearly 10 million American households don\u2019t have bank accounts, and they are typically lower-income, younger and unemployed.\n\nSome employers load employees\u2019 wages onto payroll cards, essentially replacing the traditional paper paycheck. But when workers use these cards to withdraw their salaries at ATMs or make purchases, they\u2019re often hit with fees.\n\nNew rules are supposed to limit the fees these cards can charge\n\nUnder a new rules that took effect in April, prepaid card companies were required to submit their fees, terms and conditions to the CFPB. The new rules also mandated clear, standardized fee disclosures and put \u201csignificant limits\u201d on overdraft charges, said Saunders.\n\nThe new rules put limits on the amount of overdraft fees and how often companies were allowed to charge them. \u201cThe bottom line is overdraft fees are pretty much gone from prepaid cards as a result,\u201d according to Saunders.\n\nCards in use include over-the-counter, general purpose cards like an AccountNow Gold Visa VISA, +0.05% Prepaid Card and the Dollar General DG, +0.39% Mastercard. The cards can also be loaded with tax refunds, like the H&R Block HRB, +0.51% Emerald Prepaid Mastercard MA, -0.63% , and government benefits, like the Direct Express card used for Social Security payments. ADP, ADP, -0.20% the payroll and benefits manager, has a TotalPay card companies can load with employees\u2019 salaries.\n\nLast year, the general purpose card alone was a $370.2 billion market, according to C. Sue Brown, director of prepaid cards at Mercator Advisory Group, a market research firm. Gift cards accounted for an additional $332 billion in the prepaid market last year, she said.\n\nThe new rules do not apply to gift cards, rebate cards or cards linked to health savings accounts.\n\nConsumers won\u2019t learn about some prepaid cards\n\nThe CFPB database currently has more than 2,000 cards listed on the site, but it\u2019s missing some \u201cpayday lender prepaid cards\u201d that are on the market, Saunders said.\n\nThe cards are presented as \u201cbank accounts\u201d so the lenders can avoid the new rules and limits on overdraft fees, she said, pointing to one company in particular called NetSpend.\n\nA NetSpend representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Texas prepaid card provider is listed as the program manager for a number of cards in the CFPB database. But Saunders said it has also created \u201cbank account\u201d products to take customers away from the cards with overdraft protections and towards a service without overdraft protections.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the prepaid card rule was to make sure people know fees on prepaid cards and protect them from abusive overdraft features,\u201d she said. \u201cNetSpend is attempting to evade these rules by claiming its [products are] something it\u2019s not.\u201d", "description": "Some so-called \u2018payday lender cards\u2019 aren\u2019t on the quietly-launched database, the National Consumer Law Center says.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT547_comput_ZG_20191017151629.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
