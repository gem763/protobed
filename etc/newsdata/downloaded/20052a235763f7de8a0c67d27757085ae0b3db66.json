Energy expenses of all kinds are near their lowest levels, as a share of disposable income, since the World War II.\n\nAmong the reasons, say economists: Better fuel efficiency across the board, and the shift of the economy from manufacturing, which is energy-intensive, to services.\n\nThe latest move is big for a single day. And it\u2019s been cushioned by President Trump\u2019s move to release supplies from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created for just this purpose.\n\n\u2018Oil is like oxygen to the economy.\u2019 \u2014 Steven Kopits, chief executive of energy consulting firm Princeton Energy Advisors\n\nBut on a longer-term view, so far the rise in prices is minimal.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s unimportant.\n\n\u201cOil is like oxygen to the economy,\u201d says Steven Kopits, chief executive of energy consulting firm Princeton Energy Advisors. \u201cWe almost always have an oil price spike preceding a recession. Oil is our monopoly transportation fuel.\u201d\n\nKopits noted that oil prices surged before the recession of 1958, the energy crisis recessions of the 1970s and early 1980s, and the 1990-1 recession. He might have added that crude oil prices doubled in the year leading up to the financial crash of 2008.\n\nAnd even if the U.S. economy is less exposed to oil price fluctuations than it once was, that\u2019s not the same for all other countries. China is now the world\u2019s biggest oil importer. (One reason America is more energy efficient: We\u2019ve moved a lot of our manufacturing to Asia).\n\nFolk memories run deep, especially of the crises of the 1974 and 1979-80, when disruptions of the energy supplies from the Middle East plunged America and the western economies into economic and political crises. So it\u2019s understandable that people are nervous about threats to oil supplies.\n\nAs for the effect on the U.S. economy: It\u2019s now a two-way street, says Gregory Daco at Oxford Economics. The U.S. is no longer a major net importer of oil. We\u2019re actually on the cusp of becoming an exporter.\n\nSo while a big jump in oil prices would hurt the consumer, it would also boost cash flow and business investment in the shale oil territories like Oklahoma and North Dakota, he said. \u201cFor the broad economy, there is increased evidence that oil prices affect the economy in much more nuanced ways than they did 10 or 20 years ago,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd it would be great for all those \u201cgreen economy\u201d companies that want to cut our carbon footprints. The more we have to pay for gasoline, the more attractive their products and services will look in comparison.
