It is horrible that Europe doesn't act,' 60-year-old civil servant Deni Saball said while protesting in the street. 'I don't want to be European. I don't want to be Spanish.'\n\nProtests were also reported in other towns across the wealthy northeastern region.\n\nThe Supreme Court sentenced nine leaders to sentences from nine to 13 years for sedition and misuse of public funds.
