This is in order to evaluate taking possible legal action and against whom it should be tabled, before the relevant and opportune public organisations or legal organisms.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Spain\u2019s La Liga is considering legal action after the first league Clasico of the season between Barcelona and Real Madrid was rescheduled for Dec. 18 by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Barca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
