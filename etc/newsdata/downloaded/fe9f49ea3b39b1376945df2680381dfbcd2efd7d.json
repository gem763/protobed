The group, holding a five-day meeting, will decide on Friday whether to retain that, or blacklist it alongside Iran and North Korea.\n\nIf blacklisted, Islamabad faces financial consequences and economic setbacks at a time when its economy is facing a balance of payment crisis.\n\n\u201cThe main challenge for Pakistan is to convince the FATF that it is taking complete and irreversible steps against terrorist financing,\u201d Michael Kugelman, deputy director Asia Program at the Wilson Center thinktank, told Reuters by email.\n\nPakistan, which blames arch-rival India for lobbying to blacklist it, is relying for support on friendly countries like China, Turkey and Malaysia.\n\nThree votes are mandatory for any country to escape the blacklisting. Two top government officials and a security personnel told Reuters that in a recent visit to Beijing, Pakistan\u2019s civil and military leadership secured a guarantee from Chinese leaders that Islamabad would not be placed on blacklist. China is presiding over the ongoing FATF plenary in France.\n\n\u201cGod willing, we\u2019re trying that we get out of this grey-list as soon as possible, and I think you should believe that a comprehensive effort is being put in place,\u201d Finance chief Abdul Hafeez Shaikh told a news conference over the weekend.\n\nIf Pakistan does avert blacklisting it will be just a temporary relief until the FATF meets again in February, 2020.\n\nCRITICAL REPORT\n\nAhead of the current plenary, the watchdog\u2019s Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) issued a critical report on progress made by Islamabad since last year.\n\nOf the 40 recommendations, the report said, Pakistan fully complied with only one, largely complied with nine, partially complied with 26, and totally missed four parameters, which were mandatory if Islamabad wanted to be removed from the grey list.\n\nIt said Pakistan should adequately identify, assess and understand risks associated with militant groups operating in Pakistan such as Islamic State group, al-Qaeda, Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which continue to raise funds openly.\n\nIslamabad says it has seized the groups\u2019 assets, and put the militants on trials, like the entire leadership of the JuD, including its chief Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks in 2008, which killed 166 people.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that Pakistan has taken very real steps against terrorist financing, but so long as the state retains ties to militant groups, concerns will remain within FATF about Islamabad\u2019s genuine commitment to act conclusively,\u201d the Wilson Center\u2019s Kugelman said.\n\nPakistani author and analyst Ayesha Siddiqa said Pakistan was unlikely to completely abandon militant proxies any time soon.\n\n\u201cI would start believing when JeM infrastructure gets downsized, its leader Masud Azhar is publicly arrested and put on trial,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cWith Afghanistan still brewing, I don\u2019t think we are close to cleaning our house.\u201d", "description": "Backed by longtime ally China, Pakistan is confident it will avert blacklisting over terrorism financing by a global watchdog on Friday but it will not be completely off the hook until it proves it is genuinely severing ties with Islamist militants, officials and analysts said.", "authors": ["Asif Shahzad", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
