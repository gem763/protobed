By providing exponentially greater calculation power than the machines we use today, quantum computers could one day transform the way we communicate ideas, conceal data and comprehend the universe.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe result is also a feather in the cap for both Google and the United States because quantum technology is expected to confer huge economic and national security advantages to whoever can master it first.\n\nThe technology community has been abuzz about the breakthrough ever since a leaked version of the study was published on (and then removed from) a NASA website last month. Writing in the magazine Quanta, Caltech theoretical physicist John Preskill called the result \u201ca remarkable achievement in experimental physics and a testament to the brisk pace of progress in quantum computing hardware.\u201d\n\nBut the claim has also prompted skepticism from competitors. Researchers at IBM, which has been working on its own quantum machines, argued in a blog post this week that a classical computer system would in fact take two and a half days to perform the calculation in Google\u2019s report \u2014 and would make fewer mistakes in the process. The IBM scientists also questioned the use of the James Bond-esque term \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d which seems to imply that classical computers are about to become obsolete.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhoever turns out to be right, quantum supremacy is a largely symbolic achievement; the specific task assigned to the Google computer has no practical application.\n\nBut Preskill, who coined the term in 2012, wrote in Quanta that he aimed to convey the notion that \u201cthis is a privileged time in the history of our planet,\u201d when the most arcane laws of physics might be harnessed for human ambitions.\n\nOne bit, two bit, red bit, qubit\n\nScientists have known for a century that the predictable laws of Newtonian physics \u2014 objects fall down; matter can only be in one place at one time \u2014 fall apart at the atomic and subatomic level.\n\nIn this quantum realm, electrons leap instantaneously from one energy state to another. Particles can exist in multiple states at the same time, a phenomenon known as \u201csuperposition.\u201d They can also stay connected across large distances, which Einstein called \u201cspooky\u201d and modern physicists call \u201centanglement.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith quantum computing, scientists can put these weird, wild particles to work.\n\nClassical computers encode information in \u201cbits,\u201d an electrical or optical pulse that can represent either a 0 or 1. Eight bits constitute a \u201cbyte,\u201d which can typically store one character \u2014 for example, the letter A, or a dollar sign. The first 8-inch floppy disk held 242,944 bytes. Apple\u2019s new iPhone 11 comes with 64 billion bytes.\n\nThe Summit system at Oak Ridge National Lab, a classical supercomputer that takes up two tennis courts\u2019 worth of floor space and can perform 200 quadrillion calculations per second, boasts a whopping 250 petabytes of storage \u2014 in bytes, that number comes out to about 250,000,000,000,000,000.\n\nAD\n\nBut superposition means that a quantum bit, or qubit, isn\u2019t confined to being either 0 or 1. It can exist as both at once. This means it can carry twice as much information, a power that increases exponentially with each qubit added: Two qubits convey four possible numbers; three are able to carry eight; four is the equivalent of 16. Entanglement further beefs up a system\u2019s computing power by allowing it to perform multiple calculations at once.\n\nAD\n\nBy the time you get up to 53 qubits \u2014 the size of both Google\u2019s Sycamore processor and a similar machine being built at IBM \u2014 you\u2019re approaching the potential of supercomputers like Summit.\n\nThat is, if your quantum computer works. A faint noise or a glimmer of heat can alter a superposition, leading to errors. Measuring a particle, or disturbing it in any way, will cause the superposition to \u201cdecohere,\u201d or collapse. The qubit becomes an ordinary bit. Add more qubits to a system, and decoherence happens even faster.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s what stands between researchers like those at Google and the quantum world they hope to attain. To build an effective quantum computer, scientists must figure out how to create and manipulate entangled qubits that last long enough to actually do something interesting with them.\n\nAD\n\nThe quantum world\n\nThe possibilities presented by quantum computing are what entice companies and governments to keep plugging away at it.\n\nSeveral technology companies are competing to create quantum machines; IBM has even made its prototype available online for anyone to use. Last year, President Trump signed into law the National Quantum Initiative Act, which establishes research centers to focus on quantum information science. Meanwhile, China has spent billions on quantum technology development.\n\nAD\n\nThe most obvious potential applications of this research are in the realm of national security. Entangled particles could one day be used for \u201cquantum communication\u201d \u2014 a means of sending super-secure messages that doesn\u2019t rely on cables or wireless signals. The tremendous processing power of quantum computers might be used to break previously unbreakable codes.\n\nAD\n\nBut those are far from the only uses. Biologists might use quantum computers to understand natural processes far too complex for classical machines to simulate. Pharmaceutical researchers could employ them to discover new drugs. Quantum computing promises to generate better artificial intelligence and more effective nanotechnologies.\n\n\u201cOnly by challenging the entanglement frontier,\u201d Preskill wrote in 2012, referring to the bleeding edge of quantum research, \u201cwill we learn whether Nature provides extravagant resources far beyond what the classical world would allow.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "For the first time, a new study claims, a machine has harnessed quantum physics to answer a question no classical computer could solve.", "authors": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Reporter For Speaking Of Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ujwmgujG3yx3xEwCFuh0Vff0CLM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FSMERUVSWJBTRE7J4UOZRWACGQ.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
