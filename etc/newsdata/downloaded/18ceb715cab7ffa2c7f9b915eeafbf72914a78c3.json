Candice Brown shows this novice baker how it's done", "language": "en", "text": "One of the delights of watching the contestants at work on The Great British Bake Off is how inspirational they are. Their endeavours make me want to stride into my own kitchen and grab a wooden spoon and mixing bowl.\n\nBut it\u2019s not long before enthusiasm boils over into overconfidence. I imagine myself putting all the bakers to shame on a weekly basis \u2013 despite the sum of my baking achievements to date being one passable plate of chocolate brownies and a lemon drizzle cake bought from Tesco, to which I added a personal touch (a splatter of icing).\n\nStill, if I had all the cooking equipment available to them in the tent, or if a rare handshake with Paul Hollywood was on the cards, I would surely rise to the occasion\u2026 wouldn't I?\n\nA showstopper masterclass with former Bake Off winner Candice Brown (launching Breville's new HeatSoft hand mixer) was the perfect opportunity to put my cake mixture where my mouth is. The challenge? A coffee, date and walnut marble cake. The allotted time? Just 90 minutes.\n\nGranted, such a bake does not demand quite the same level of complexity as, say, a bread lion or a gingerbread pub, but what gives something 'showstopper' qualities isn't looks alone. \u201cI\u2019ve always said taste is so much more important than presentation,\u201d Brown insists, while demonstrating how to prepare the cake mix.", "description": "One of the delights of watching the contestants at work on The Great British Bake Off is how inspirational they are.", "authors": ["Jack Rear"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2019/09/23/IMG_20190918_105710-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwd4VTQMKSmyn_yEZhDVm0HQ.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
