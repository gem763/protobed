AAP\n\nThe themes follow the brand\u2019s transition from a small, family-run firm of silversmiths to global purveyor of watches and jewellery. Nothing can compete with the pieces from the company\u2019s Heritage Collection, some of which are being exhibited for the first time, or the objects on loan from private collections.\n\nNo surprise this includes jewels and watches once owned and worn by luminaries such as Elizabeth Taylor (more on her one-of-a-kind Serpenti watch in a moment), Gina Lollobrigida, Ingrid Bergman, Anna Magnani and Audrey Hepburn.\n\nOne of the Serpenti timepieces in the exhibition (along with about 80 dresses) is from inveterate collector Cecilia Matteucci Lavarini, who exemplifies the consummate accumulator.\n\nBorn in Tuscany to a retailing family that developed a deep interest in fashion and accessories, she acquired a taste for jewels and dresses from childhood. Lavarini began collecting seriously in the 1980s. Her High Jewellery Serpenti watch, one of 11 in the exhibition, is a unique model in gold and platinum with rubies and diamonds, dating to 1967.\n\nSpeculation remains as to whether the watch was a gift from Richard Burton, a signing bonus in Taylor\u2019s contract, or a gift to herself.\n\nExotic and lithe, the Serpenti is one of the few iconic women\u2019s watches of the period and remains in the brand\u2019s catalogue (albeit in updated forms). Bulgari\u2019s distinctive charmer, with its snake-like head and coiled, wrap-around bracelet, debuted in the 1940s, but its \u201cInstagram moment\u201d came when one was photographed on Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s wrist while she was shooting Cleopatra in 1962.\n\nSpeculation remains as to whether the watch was a gift from leading man (and future husband) Richard Burton or then husband Eddie Fisher; a signing bonus in Taylor\u2019s contract; or a gift to herself to celebrate her million-dollar pay day for the film \u2013 the highest salary ever for an actress at the time. Whatever the source, it was hardly an inconspicuous adornment.\n\nDiamond-pav\u00e9 heads, hand-crafted gold and enamel scales and emerald eyes, along with internals by major manufacturers such as Jaeger-LeCoultre, Audemars Piguet and Vacheron Constantin set the Serpenti watch collection apart. Typically, the movement was concealed in a snake\u2019s head with the dial under a hinged cover.\n\nNumerous unusual creations have followed over the years, including a one-off in pink and white enamel with sapphire eyes commissioned by legendary Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, a renowned collector of oversized accessories.\n\nBulgari\u2019s most recent take on the Serpenti is the Seduttori, a range arriving in October that introduces a bolder, more modern design. It\u2019s thinner, with a more traditional case shape and a supple scale-like bracelet replacing the more elaborate coils. Crafted primarily in rose, yellow or white gold with diamond paving and cabochon-cut gemstones, the Seduttori won\u2019t be mistaken for any other timepiece \u2013 nor as anything but a progeny of the original.\n\nArriving in October, Bulgari\u2019s Seduttori watch is an updated \u201creimagination\u201d of the Serpenti.\n\nPrices for the diamond-set versions begin at about $40,000 and range to $165,000 for entirely paved pieces, but there will also be simpler (and rather less expensive) steel and gold versions, giving you the look for every day without necessarily the collectability.\n\nBut if iconic steel or gold watches happen to be what you\u2019re collecting, well, even the less exotic Seduttori could live up to its name \u2013 and prove irresistibly seductive.\n\nThe heritage issue of LUXURY is out on Friday, September 6 inside The Australian Financial Review.
