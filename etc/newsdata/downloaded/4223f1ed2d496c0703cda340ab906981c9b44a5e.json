There was no immediate word from the Israeli military on any casualties.\n\nIsrael has been on alert for a possible confrontation with Hezbollah for the past week after drones attacked what security officials in the region described as a target in a Beirut suburb linked to precision-guided missile projects.\n\nHezbollah's leader said late on Saturday its field commanders were ready to respond to the drone attack, which he blamed on Israel.\n\nAmid the Hezbollah threats, Israel had moved reinforcements into the border area, which had been largely quiet since both long-time enemies fought a month-long war in 2006.\n\nIn a statement, the Israeli military said several anti-tank missiles were fired from Lebanon on Sunday and \"a number of hits were confirmed\".\n\nFollowing the missile attacks, Israelis living near the frontier were instructed by authorities to stay indoors.
