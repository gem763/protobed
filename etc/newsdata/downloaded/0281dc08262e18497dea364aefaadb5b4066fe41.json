If you\u2019re looking at thinness, the new iPad mini slimmed down from its predecessor, and is slightly lighter, too. But it\u2019s also gotten a bit taller \u2014 to such an extent that many cases for the iPad mini 3 just won\u2019t fit. Apple sells a front smart cover and silicone case for the new mini\u2019s backside, but annoyingly the more comprehensive Smart Case no longer exists. Now if you want full protection, you\u2019ll have to buy both the cover and rear case for over $100 after tax. Ouch.\n\nA year later, we\u2019re now looking at the iPad mini 4. Considering the barely-there mention it got at Apple\u2019s September event, you might think we\u2019d be in for another underwhelming refresh. But you\u2019d be wrong. For 2015, we\u2019ve gotten the opposite of a lazy revision; Apple has delivered improvements at almost every turn. The iPad mini we wanted last year? It\u2019s here today.\n\nLast year, Apple delivered a dud of an iPad. I\u2019m not talking about the iPad Air 2, which set an incredible new benchmark for the type of speed and performance consumers can expect from tablets. No, I\u2019m referring to the disappointing, mailed-in iPad mini 3 . In 2014, Apple decided to update the the iPad mini 2\u2019s spec sheet with just one thing: Touch ID. The result was a tablet that felt underwhelming the moment it arrived on store shelves \u2014 despite costing the same $399 as the earlier model.\n\nAside from tweaks to the mini 4\u2019s dimensions, it looks nearly identical to the 3. The only obvious hardware change is Apple\u2019s removal of the orientation lock / mute switch; you\u2019ll need to swipe up Control Center for those two options now. Color choices remain the same with space gray, silver, and gold versions available. Tragically, there\u2019s no perfect match for your shiny new rose gold iPhone 6S. Storage has also gone unchanged, which means almost everyone should skip the entry-level $399 16GB model for 64GB or higher. Just pretend the 16GB model doesn't exist There\u2019s nothing wrong with the iPad mini\u2019s continued design; its metal-and-glass construction still screams \"premium.\" But going with the same look means Apple hasn\u2019t yet addressed some legitimate critiques. For one, the company keeps using chamfered edges on its iPads, even after the iPhone graduated from this design trait last year. They look nice, but the shiny trim around the screen is always the first thing to get scratched up \u2014 even with immaculate handling. Also, the iPad mini 4\u2019s speakers, which are positioned together beneath the same grill on the bottom right, still leave a lot to be desired. No one\u2019s saying this thing needs four speakers like the iPad Pro, but it\u2019s really in need of better stereo separation. Fortunately, you\u2019ll mostly forget about these drawbacks the moment you turn the screen on. Apple\u2019s smaller iPads have always ranked behind their bigger counterparts in color reproduction \u2014 until now. The iPad mini 4 has a gorgeous, vibrant display that\u2019s on par with the iPad Air 2 and a massive step up from what came before. Better still, it\u2019s now fully laminated. Apple has eliminated the air gap between the Retina LCD and the iPad mini\u2019s cover glass, so it feels more than ever like you\u2019re touching iOS and your apps with nothing in the way. Everything feels like it's floating on glass \u2014 the same effect that's now commonplace on phones. A new anti-reflective coating also makes the iPad mini more practical for outdoor use. These improvements add up to a screen that\u2019s perfect for gaming, web browsing, watching videos, and anything else you\u2019d do on a tablet. It\u2019s just great to look at.\n\nThe new iPad mini\u2019s screen is dramatically better than previous models. Left: iPad mini 3 Right: iPad mini 4\n\nNot truly a mini iPad Air 2, but it's close Performance also falls under \"great,\" but not class-leading when compared to the full-size iPad Air 2. (It\u2019ll still outpace many Android tablets you can buy, though.) The iPad mini 4 is pushed along by Apple\u2019s 64-bit A8 processor, which is definitely an upgrade from last year but not quite as powerful as the Air 2 despite what Schiller boasted on stage. Apple says the new chip delivers speed gains of up to 30 percent, and sure, apps definitely open faster. The mini 4 has 2GB of RAM inside, so apps are also less likely to unexpectedly restart when you\u2019re multitasking, and Safari won\u2019t need to reload your tabs so often. Graphics performance has jumped by 60 percent, and it\u2019s impossible to find any current iOS game that slows down this iPad in any noticeable way. There\u2019s zero lag more often than not, and the (very) slight stutters I\u2019ve seen in the app switcher and Split View can likely be blamed on the brand new iOS 9 rather than the iPad\u2019s hardware. Hopefully they\u2019ll be gone in a software update or two. I\u2019m not sure who worries about iPad battery life anymore, but the mini 4 holds true to the 10-hour figure that Apple promises. Wi-Fi speeds have also been boosted, and as usual you can buy an LTE-capable version for $130 on top of each model\u2019s regular cost. The Apple SIM is back and offers nice carrier flexibility, but Verizon customers will still need a separate SIM card to get on the network. As for iOS 9, the iPad mini 4 is fully capable of split-screen multitasking just like the iPad Air 2. But the feature is a bit less appealing on a 7.9-inch screen. In Split View, Safari basically just shows you a smartphone view of websites, and text can sometimes be an eye strain even with the iPad held at normal distances. I don\u2019t foresee many people doubling up on text-heavy apps like Microsoft Office and Twitter. Maybe running things side by side will prove more useful for visual apps like Hulu, Maps, and Photos. It\u2019s a feature that\u2019s there if you need it, but better suited for Apple\u2019s larger tablets. That aside, other iOS 9 changes like picture-in-picture, the revamped Notes app, and all-new Apple News are welcome improvements. And despite hating it on iPhone, I\u2019m more tolerant of the new app switcher on iPad for whatever reason. Oh, and the camera\u2019s better too, for all of you people who shoot pictures with a tablet. Apple bumped the mini 4\u2019s camera up to 8 megapixels, and photo quality is basically on par with the iPad Air 2. That means it\u2019s perfectly adequate \u2014 dare I say even good \u2014 in ideal light, but for everything else, you should really only open the iPad\u2019s camera app when your phone is out of reach. The 1.2-megapixel FaceTime HD camera up front has also been upgraded to perform a bit better in low light, but it doesn\u2019t compare to the new 5-megapixel front camera on the iPhone 6S.\n\nThe mini 4's camera is improved, but still can't match Apple's latest iPhones.", "description": "Last year, Apple delivered a dud of an iPad.
