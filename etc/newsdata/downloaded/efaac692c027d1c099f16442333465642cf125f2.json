Thanks for waking up with us.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doubled down on his call to investigate Vice President Joe Biden. (Ron Sachs/Pool)\n\nAt The White House\n\nTHE LATEST ON UKRAINE: President Trump admitted yesterday that he mentioned former vice president Joe Biden during a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nRefresher: The Post first reported last week that Trump pressured Zelensky on the call to investigate a gas company with ties to Hunter Biden \u2014 the subject of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint. The call coincides with the Trump administration withholding $250 million of military and intelligence aid to Ukraine.\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump mentioned the aid as leverage on the call with the new Ukrainian leader but the administration only greenlit the aid last week after the whistleblower's complaint spilled into public view.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s got a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nLater on in the day, Trump told reporters in Houston that he'd \u201chave the right\u201d to mention Biden's name with Zelensky and that he'd \u201clove\u201d to release a transcript of the call: \u201cI\u2019m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son \u2026 Joe\u2019s got a lot of problems. Joe\u2019s got enough problems. But what he said was a terrible thing,\u201d suggesting Biden had lied about communications with his son about Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son \u2026 Joe\u2019s got a lot of problems. Joe\u2019s got enough problems. But what he said was a terrible thing,\u201d suggesting Biden had lied about communications with his son about Ukraine.\u201d Reminder: There is no evidence that Biden committed any wrongdoing.\n\nFull-court press: Trump's admission came hours after senior members of his administration pulled off a full-court press on the Sunday shows, arguing they supported investigating whether Biden may have participated in \u201ccorrupt\u201d behavior.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky and claimed it would be inappropriate to publish the transcript between the two leaders.\n\n\u201cAmerica cannot have our elections interfered with. \u2026 If there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know,\u201d Pompeo said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nPompeo said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI would say these are confidential discussions between two foreign leaders but I think the bigger issue is Biden came out this weekend saying he never had any discussions with his son. His son came out and said he had had business discussions with his father so I think that the real issue is not what the president said, but what, indeed, did Biden\u2019s son do,\u201d Mnuchin said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nAll eyes on UNGA: Trump is scheduled to meet with Zelensky this week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.\n\nAs for Biden, he finally responded to Trump's claims over the weekend:\n\nLet\u2019s be clear, Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our elections. It goes against everything the United States stands for.\n\n\n\nWe must make him a one-term president. \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 22, 2019\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter. Not a regular subscriber?\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). (Scott G Winterton/The Deseret News)\n\nOn The Hill\n\nChanging minds: The fallout from the episode is unlikely to subside in the immediate future as some House Democrats who have resisted calls to initiate an impeachment inquiry are now changing course. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has also refused to hand over the whistleblower's complaint to Congress and this could all come to a head on Thursday, when he is slated to testify publicly before the House Intelliegence Committee. The DNI's inspector general will testify before the committee behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cNo director of national intelligence has ever refused to turn over a whistleblower complaint,\u201d Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nThe most important voice: \u201cIf the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Democrats.\n\n\"The growing calls to impeach Trump \u2014 or do something bold to confront the White House \u2014 follows an embarrassing week for House Democrats,\" my collaegue Rachael Bade reports. \"Many feel increasingly helpless in fighting the White House\u2019s obstruction, as Pelosi looks to the courts to uphold congressional subpoenas, a process that has taken months and could drag out for years.\"\n\nInherent contempt: Some House Democrats were fed up after Corey Lewandowski's in-your-face testimony last week, and urged invoking little-used powers to jail or fine people who defy subpoenas. \u201cI say do it,\u201d said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), according to Rachael. \u201cLet them argue in court that they take the position that it\u2019s legally questionable. We back off of everything! We\u2019ve been very weak.\u201d\n\nImpeachment: Pelosi might not have used the word impeachment in the letter but Schiff went further than he has when it comes to the \"I\" word. Notably, he spoke with Pelosi spoke over the weekend \u201cto coordinate their statements,\u201d per the New York Times's Nick Fandos, Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman.\n\n\u201cI have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment,\u201d Schiff said on CNN's 'State of the Union'. \u201cBut if the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents.\u201d\n\nWhat's giving House Dems some more confidence about impeachment? They're hearing it a bit more in their districts. Three House Ds from v diff parts of the country all told us the same on Sunday. \u2014 Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 23, 2019\n\nFrom the right: Several senior Republican lawmakers surprisingly broke with the party line and called for the administration to release the transcript of Trump's call.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping the president can share, in an appropriate way, information to deal with the drama around the phone call,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told the Times. \u201cI think it would be good for the country if we could deal with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tweeted.\n\nNevertheless, it's unlikely that Republicans will publicly challenge Trump on the issue. Eighteen House Republicans to date have \"announced plans to resign, retire or run for another office,\" my colleague Rachael Bade reports -- \"a reminder of just how much Trump has remade the GOP \u2014 and of the purge of those who dare to oppose him.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for a purpose \u2014 and it\u2019s not this petty, childish b------t,\u201d Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), 62, told Rachael an interview in early September of his decision to retire after Trump's tweet telling four U.S. congresswomen to \"go back\" to their countries of origin.\n\nThe front of the United Nations Headquarters. (Craig Ruttle/AP)\n\nGlobal Power\n\nWHO ISN'T COMING TO THE UNGA CLIMATE SUMMIT: U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is today holding a special climate summit in which he has demanded that participating countries \u201cbring with them promises of tangible action, such as vowing to reach net zero emissions by 2050, scaling back fossil fuel subsidies and halting construction of coal-fired power plants,\u201d report Brady Dennis and Steve Mufson. The summit is taking place as part of the U.N. General Assembly annual meeting this week in New York.\n\nKey quote: \" \u201cI told leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments,\u201d Guterres told reporters this week. \u201cWe are losing the race against climate change.

But that is just a formality. The Trump administration is already busy trying to roll back Obama era regulations and legislation.

And the president has praised Brazil's new president, who favors development of the Amazon, and used most of his firepower with China on trade. For President Obama, the negotiations on climate change were among the high points of his diplomatic record. He corralled a group of difficult allies \u2014 China, India and Brazil \u2014 to make unprecedented commitments to slow or reverse greenhouse gas emissions. Those countries might have been upset that the United States had already emitted far more, but they bit their tongues and joined the international accord reached in December 2015.\u201d\n\nOne glaring example of the sea change will be the absence of the United States from the podium Monday. U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has demanded that the countries attending Monday\u2019s summit bring with them promises of tangible action, such as vowing to reach net zero emissions by 2050, scaling back fossil fuel subsidies and halting construction of coal-fired power plants.\u201d\n\nU.N.

Elsewhere, activists aim to shutdown the D.C. commute as a way to draw attention to climate change, our colleague Hannah Natanson reports.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg)\n\nThe Campaign\n\nSANDERS IS IN TROUBLE: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \"has begun to eclipse [Sen. Bernie] Sanders\u2019s once-dominant standing among the Democratic Party\u2019s most liberal voters and surpass him in some polls in the first two states in the nominating process: Iowa and New Hampshire,\" our colleagues Sean Sullivan, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Chelsea Janes report.\n\nThis comes at a bad time for Bernie: \"These challenges have been compounded by volatility inside Sanders\u2019s operations in Iowa and New Hampshire. The campaign quietly fired its Iowa political director in the late summer and has yet to name a replacement \u2014 a key vacancy as the race enters a crucial phase, with less than five months to go before the February caucuses,\" our colleagues write.\n\n\"These challenges have been compounded by volatility inside Sanders\u2019s operations in Iowa and New Hampshire.

And the gold standard of Iowa polls didn't allay those fears: \"The poll provided the clearest indication yet that Warren is eating into his base.
