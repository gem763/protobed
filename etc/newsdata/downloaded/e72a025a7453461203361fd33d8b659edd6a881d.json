It has since been updated and republished.]\n\nVanguard should probably be thanking Warren Buffett.\n\nIn Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK.B) 2014 shareholders letter, Buffett mentioned Vanguard funds in a big way. Specifically, he recommended that the cash left to his wife be invested 10% in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. Not just any index fund mind you, but a Vanguard fund in particular.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhether it be exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds, the Oracle of Omaha believes Vanguard funds are the way to go. With that in mind, I\u2019ve put together a portfolio of two ETFs, two mutual funds and a fifth wildcard. The resulting portfolio should be appropriate for Buffett\u2019s wife \u2014 or anyone else, for that matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX)\n\nTake Buffett's Advice: 5 Vanguard Funds to Buy More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAllocation: 50% of Portfolio\n\n10-year performance: 13.41%\n\n\n\nThe goal here is to keep costs to a minimum while generally sticking to Buffett\u2019s hypothesis when it comes to his wife\u2019s investments.\n\nIn that case, it makes more sense for the S&P 500 investment to be a mutual fund rather than an ETF (although Vanguard Funds do offer commission-free ETFs) to avoid paying commissions on the largest segment of the portfolio. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX) charge an annual expense ratio of just 0.04%.\n\nYour annual fees would amount to a mere $20 on a $50,000 portfolio. That\u2019s hard to beat, and Buffett knows it. The largest holdings in this fund include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). The minimum investment is $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIMAX)\n\nTake Buffett's Advice: 5 Vanguard Funds to Buy More\n\nAllocation: 20% of Portfolio\n\n10-year performance:\n\n13.50%\n\n\n\nThe VFIAX covers the large-cap portion of the portfolio quite nicely. While Buffett might not be fond of mid-cap stocks being added to the mix, but evidence suggests mid-caps outperformed large-cap stocks over a four-year period between 2009 and 2013.\n\nIn fact, John Hancock published a report in 2012 that cautions investors about underweighting mid-caps because of an assumption that a large-cap fund combined with a small-cap fund will do the job. That\u2019s simply not the case.\n\nMid-cap stocks tend to provide an attractive combination of risk and reward. For this reason, I recommend the Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIMAX), which tracks the CRSP Mid Cap Index, an index composed of stocks that fall between the top 70%-85% of investable market capitalization.\n\nThey\u2019re big enough to survive an economic hit but small enough to still be growing. With an expense ratio of 0.05%, this entry on our list of Vanguard funds is giving you safety and performance in one. Top holdings include Moody\u2019s (NYSE:MCO) and Roper Technologies (NYSE: ROP).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.
