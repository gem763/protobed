That vessel last turned on its tracking devices in August near the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas.\n\nLt. Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet overseeing the Mideast, said authorities there were \"aware of reports of this incident,\" but declined to comment further.\n\nTankerTrackers, which monitors oil export, said it believed the tanker was carrying oil to Syria.\n\nThe reported attack comes after the U.S. has alleged that in past months Iran attacked oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, something denied by Tehran.\n\nIt also comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the West after Gibraltar seized an Iranian supertanker in July on suspicion it was carrying the crude to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.\n\nFriday's incident could push tensions between Iran and the U.S. even higher, more than a year after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions now crushing Iran's economy.\n\nThe mysterious attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, Iran shooting down a US military surveillance drone and other incidents across the wider Middle East followed Trump's decision.\n\nThe latest assault saw Saudi Arabia's vital oil industry come under a drone-and-cruise-missile attack, halving the kingdom's output.\n\nThe US has blamed Iran for the attack, something denied by Tehran. Yemen's Houthi rebels, whom the kingdom is fighting in a yearslong war, claimed that assault, though analysts say the missiles used in the attack wouldn't have the range to reach the sites from Yemen.", "description": "Two rockets struck an Iranian tanker traveling through the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia on Friday, Iranian officials said, the latest incident in the region amid months of heightened tensions between Tehran and the U.S. There was no word from Saudi Arabia on the reported attack and Saudi officials", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jGK8QCM7oCSMBEQrtBIy0g--~B/aD00ODY7dz03Nzg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/43744b6b206bf3c3fd551215d7ea6aac", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
