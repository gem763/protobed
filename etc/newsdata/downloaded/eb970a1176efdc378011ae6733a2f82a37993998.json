Other recent examples include Nightstar Therapeutics, Telecity and Cambridge Silicon Radio.\n\n'Another day, another takeover of a UK company by a foreign business as a US private equity firm makes a bid for FTSE 250 software firm Sophos,' noted Russ Mould of AJ Bell.\n\n'Sterling weakness has made pound-denominated assets look cheap and so we've seen many overseas firms pounce on UK assets in the past few years.'\n\nMould said Thoma Bravo's bid was 'fairly generous' with a 37.1 per cent premium to last Friday's market closing price.\n\n'The 583p take-out price is considerably ahead of the 225p price at which Sophos joined the market in 2015, meaning investors who bought at the IPO offer would have made 159 per cent share price return in four years. That's a stellar performance when you consider the historical returns from shares as an asset class have been approximately 7 per cent a year,' Mould continued.\n\n'The downside of Sophos receiving a takeover bid is that the London market loses yet another tech stock.'", "description": "Shares in the company jumped by 36 per cent to\u00a0580.45p on the news - just a few pence shy of\u00a0 Thoma Bravo's offer of $7.40 (583p) per share.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
