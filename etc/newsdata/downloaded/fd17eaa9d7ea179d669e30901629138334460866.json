On my way back to Ness to announce our findings. 10am GMT 5/9 at @LochNessCentre #lochnesshunters https://t.co/eJjR5d2f9R \u2014 Neil Gemmell (@ProfGemmell) September 2, 2019\n\nGemmell said his team had analyzed the water samples for environmental DNA that creatures shed as they move through an environment.\n\n\u201cWe can collect that DNA and obtain a very accurate indication of what the species was that shed that material, and over time you can collect quite a large body of information from literally a liter of water,\u201d he said.\n\nAP, FILE\n\nBut they found no evidence of a plesiosaur -- a prehistoric marine reptile that some had theorized might be the monster.\n\n\u201cThere is probably not a giant scaly reptile swimming around Loch Ness,\u201d said Gemmell.\n\nSo what might the monster be?\n\nOne \"plausible\" idea based on anecdotal evidence, according to Gemmell, is that the monster could be a large eel.\n\nBut that theory, too, raises questions. Eels usually only grow to four to six feet, and they migrate to reproduce.\n\n\u201cPlenty of uncertainty remains,\u201d said Gemmell.\n\nAnd though the survey was comprehensive Gemmell made the point that a lack of evidence does not mean the mystery has been solved.\n\nScotland reacted to the report with some humor about the mysterious creature known locally as \"Nessie.\"", "description": "Scientists testing Scotland's Loch Ness for DNA say monster may be a giant eel", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/loch-ness-monster-ap-ps-180523_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
