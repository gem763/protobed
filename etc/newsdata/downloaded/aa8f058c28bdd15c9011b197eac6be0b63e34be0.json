But perhaps the proper place to start is Logan Roy, whose presence is felt in virtually every scene on Succession, even the ones where he\u2019s absent. His cruelty and capriciousness dominate everyone in his orbit, forcing his children especially to react only to him, whether through pitiful acts of rebellion or vile mimicry, or through substance abuse, sexual masochism, or just plain old heartbreak. He\u2019s the black hole at the center of the show, the only character who draws no sympathy, even when he\u2019s been reduced to a frail, withered, vulnerable old man. Waystar Royco is the family business, intended for his children, but the thought of actually bequeathing it to any of them is far eclipsed by an impulse to manipulate and abuse them for sport.\n\nLogan\u2019s toxic influence is all over this episode, which ingeniously compares and contrasts the Roys with the Pierces, two families that come to the news business from different ends of the political spectrum, but share an interest in obscene wealth. Logan\u2019s ostensible interest in acquiring the Pierce media group is linked to the proxy battle in defense of his company, which hopes this $25 billion asset will make Waystar too big to buy. And from the start, everyone in his inner circle with any amount of intelligence has been against the deal: The resulting debt could sink the company, and there are plenty of indications that Pierce itself isn\u2019t in good financial health \u2014 the most obvious being its willingness to indulge such an officious suitor in the first place. He\u2019s set for a vast overpay.\n\nThe actual reason for Logan\u2019s interest is more purely malevolent: He\u2019s the snot-nosed boy on the beach who wants to smash the most meticulously sculpted sandcastle. There\u2019s a sequence in Martin Scorsese\u2019s Raging Bull where Jake LaMotta, the self-destructive (and destructive-destructive) middleweight champ played by Robert De Niro, is facing a challenger named Tony Janiro. When LaMotta\u2019s wife notes offhand that Janiro is a good-looking guy, La Motta makes a point to pummel him in the ring, directing all his shots to the face. \u201cHe ain\u2019t pretty no more,\u201d he sneers to his wife after the fight. That\u2019s Logan\u2019s psychology to the core. He doesn\u2019t want these Shakespeare-quoting, Ph.D.-accumulating, Brookings Institution snobs to feel like they\u2019re better than he is. They have a price, too. For $25 billion, he gets to make the world see that they ain\u2019t pretty no more.\n\nThat accounts for why Logan refuses to give Shiv the thing she wants \u2014 the thing they agreed on \u2014 when he has the perfect opportunity to do it. As terrible and humbling as this whole affair ends up being for Shiv, Logan\u2019s primary reason for not announcing her as his successor is that it\u2019s what his adversaries want. It would make the Pierces happy if Logan would cut away Ravenhead as a peace offering \u2014 which, oh by the way, he hasn\u2019t done \u2014 and it would make them feel better if Shiv, whose political leanings are more liberal, were appointed the future steward of the Pierce brand. That way, the Pierces could get the money they so desperately need and continue to enjoy the satisfaction of performing a vital public service to the world \u2014 like, absurdly, helping in their small way to tear down the Berlin Wall. It would be an unsatisfying victory for Logan to give them anything other than money. He may want them to sell, but he needs them to sell out.\n\nNo doubt Shiv is collateral damage, though. \u201cTern Haven\u201d follows her from the very first shot, as she takes the elevator up to a family meeting before the Pierce visit and fully expects her father to make the announcement. She believes that she has an important role to play in convincing the Pierces to sell, but she\u2019s ultimately blindsided by what that role turns out to be. She and her brothers are there to work some \u201cno\u201ds into \u201cyes\u201ds, but that\u2019s as far as Logan is prepared to take it, because her position at Waystar isn\u2019t a chip he\u2019s willing to play in the negotiations. That leads to utter humiliation on her part \u2014 first from her father\u2019s continued withholding of a position he promised to her, later when she tries to force his hand at the dinner table, and once again when Logan walks away from the table after Nan Pierce insists on Shiv as successor. (Poor Tom, though. Logan is totally fine with him not overseeing the news. On that point \u2014 and that point only \u2014 he\u2019s willing to compromise.)\n\nThe scenes between Shiv and Tom are maybe the first time I\u2019ve been convinced that their relationship is real. Tom has been a useful patsy this season for his wife and father-in-law: In \u201cHunting,\u201d Shiv deployed him as her proxy to express misgivings about the Pierce deal, and here Logan wants Tom to be the \u201cright-wing ogre\u201d responsible for ATN. But Shiv, despite her Logan-esque exploitation of Tom as both blunt instrument and pitiful cuckold, really does lean on him for support, and he gives her his attention in kind. \u201cI really want this,\u201d she tells him in a break at dinner. \u201cI want to be sitting at that table.\u201d And does his best to pick her up and assure her that she\u2019s already there. It almost doesn\u2019t matter that he gives her the confidence to make a truly shocking mistake when they return. He loves her and has her back.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t love looking at Succession as a reality-show competition where someone will be declared the winner at the end, it should be said that Kendall is quietly showing some competence now that he\u2019s back in the fold. Naomi Pierce goes to great lengths to turn up just to register an emphatic \u201cno\u201d on the deal, but she and Kendall speak the same language \u2014 both children of privilege who have withered in the spotlight and lost themselves to substance abuse. Kendall does what he\u2019s best at and absorbs her insults like a sponge (\u201cYou\u2019re such a little nothing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d), but comes back to her with an insight. \u201cDon\u2019t block your own escape,\u201d he says. \u201cJust imagine getting out from under all this. You can take the money and you can just get the fuck out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re free.\u201d\n\nSad Sack Wasp Traps\n\n\u2022 So many lines and moments worth savoring this episode, but my favorite may be when Nan Pierce invites Rosa, a servant, to set down her tray and have a drink with them. It\u2019s such a perfect moment of liberal-elite benevolence, offered as a display of her magnanimousness, with the expectation that it will be politely refused. Chef\u2019s kiss, as they say.\n\n\u2022 \u201cThey want $24 billion but they also want to ensure the integrity of their news outlets into the future.\u201d \u201cAnd I want an onion to taste like a fucking peach.\u201d Logan knows exactly where he stands in this negotiation before it even happens.\n\n\u2022 Some really tough looks from Marcia on this episode. The exact source of her animus toward Logan isn\u2019t clear, but it\u2019s certainly vivid, particularly in her resentment over him trying to stage-manage her like his kids. \u201cMerci beaucoup,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to be getting top marks along with your other pupils.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Oh boy, Roman\u2019s sexual peccadilloes. It\u2019s hard to say exactly why he needs to feel deviant in order to achieve sexual gratification, but it\u2019s leading to some startling places, from his weird request that Tabitha act like she\u2019s a corpse (\u201cI think maybe the morgue is closing for the night\u201d) to a reprise of the dominant-submissive dynamic he\u2019d developed with Gerri. This show is nothing if not bold.\n\n\u2022 Logan\u2019s bullshit speech to the Pierces about the greatness and value of their media outlets may ring hollow to everyone else in the room, but Connor is touched: \u201cI like this dad. Why couldn\u2019t this dad be dad?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Naomi is quoting from Richard II in lieu of grace at the dinner table: \u201cThe purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation; that away. Men are gilded loan or painted clay. Mine honor is my life; both grow in one. Take honor from me, and my life is done.\u201d Again, all credit to Kendall for getting a \u201cyes\u201d vote out of her.\n\n\u2022 Wonderful bit of staging with Logan scanning the table as his children are each fucking up their assignments. Connor\u2019s sparring with a Pierce son (played by Mark Linn-Baker, \u201cCousin Larry\u201d of Perfect Strangers fame) is indicative: \u201cThat\u2019s just the sort of expert analysis I\u2019d expect from a deep-state wonk with both lips glued to the Soros teat.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cWatching you people melt down is most deeply satisfying activity on the planet earth.\u201d Oh cool, is Naomi a Succession fan, too?\n\nVULTURE NEWSLETTER Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
