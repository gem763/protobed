The colour scheme is bleak, with blood red and black lettering on placards being held by the demonstrators reading \u201cBurn it down\u201d and \u201cFTP\", apparently meaning \u201cF*** the police\u201d.\n\nThe 30 second clip then focuses on one of the officers, in full riot gear, staring down the protesters. In flashbacks, he is shown being given his police badge, saluting as a member of the US armed services, putting his hand over his heart during a high school football game during the national anthem, and, finally, as a child watching the aftermath of the terrorist attacks 18 years ago.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Jason Scott\n\nRobert Paxton, a professor emeritus at the University of Columbia, who specialises in part on the spread of fascism in western Europe following the Second World War, told The Independent that the imagery in the video \u2014 especially coming rom the man who governed one of the cities attacked on 9/11 \u2014 represents a \u201cdistortion\u201d of the attacks, and a borrowing of the \u201cemotional energy\u201d of the date for political means.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a thoroughly pernicious piece of propaganda,\u201d Mr Paxton said.\n\n\u201cThe protesters are other Americans, the enemy is internal, and I think that\u2019s dangerous and slippery,\u201d he continued, noting that the US was also polarised following the attacks in 2001, but that the anger was not as focused inward as Mr Giuliani is now projecting.\n\nMr Paxton said he was hesitant to describe the video itself as \u201cfascist\u201d \u2014 there are marked differences between the operations of Mr Trump\u2019s administration and that of Hitler or Mussolini \u2014 but said that there are notable elements of concern.\n\nIn the video, for instance, the \u201cdefenders of order\u201d are celebrated, and the battle between the two groups is depicted as one of good vs evil with no nuance. The protesters are dehumanised, and lack individuality.\n\nThe video, notably, appears to ignore certain American rights, like freedom of speech and dissent, in favour of law and order.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
