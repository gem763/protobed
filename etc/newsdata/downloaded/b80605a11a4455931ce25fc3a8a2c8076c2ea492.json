He called it \"transformative\" and \"mind-blowing\" for him.\n\n\"During the days we were seeing these ancient biblical sites and modern sites all at the same time and at night we were hearing from these panels from experts,\" Apple told Fox News.\n\nEach group goes through an intensive introduction course before the trip. During the trip, students visit Holy sites like the Old City of Jerusalem, Sea of Galilee, Nazareth, and Bethlehem, as well as modern sites of interest, like what is happening on borders at Syria, Gaza Strip, and they hear from local speakers about the situation in Israel. Each trip has a Shabbat dinner on Friday night with a Jewish family.\n\nWORSHIP LEADER RUNS FOR CONGRESS IN CALIFORNIA: 'MORALS ARE LOW, TAXES ARE HIGH'\n\nFor many students, it changes the way they read the Bible. Apple said, \"I think, 'Jesus was here. I was there,' and that's really cool. I felt the presence of the Lord there the entire time, pretty much.\"\n\nPassages does not take a stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, presenting students with diverse perspectives, but when it comes to the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, Phillips said they believe \"Israel is a good place.\"\n\n\"Our spiritual heritage as Christians has its foundation in Israel, it's where our faith was born...we're seen thousands of students transformed,\" Phillips said.\n\nFollowing the trip, students complete a capstone project called Passages NOW, and then they join the Passages Leader's Network, an alumni group for them to stay connected and continue growing as leaders.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"I didn\u2019t visit Israel. I was living in Israel,\" Apple said of his experience. \"They literally immerse you in the culture as much as they can. That was really cool and that really helped widen my worldview.\"", "description": "Passages Israel has been called the \"Christian birthright\" trip to Israel for the way it solidifies faith for college students.", "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
