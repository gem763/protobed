REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun/File Photo\n\nAt the Tokyo Motor Show this week, Hino Motors (7205.T), the truckmaking arm of Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), showcased the futuristic \u201cFlatformer\u201d, which had no driver\u2019s cabin and where the low-riding bed is fixed but the cargo or container section can be swapped out.\n\nOn display was a concept battery-electric model with a cargo hold divvied up into stacked storage boxes that would help parcel delivery companies to sort, load and deliver goods more efficiently.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to produce a standardized truck bed upon which customers can customize according to the services they offer,\u201d said Atsuyuki Hanazawa, manager of the design division at Hino\u2019s future projects group.\n\nExplosive growth in online shopping and increased demand for same-day deliveries have heaped pressure on courier companies and their drivers - particularly in Japan where the sector has borne the brunt of a worsening labor shortage.\n\nIn 2016, video footage of a courier in Japan kicking and tossing parcels in apparent frustration due to overwork went viral, sparking widespread public criticism.\n\nToyota\u2019s minivehicle brand Daihatsu also showed off its \u201cTsumu Tsumu\u201d model with a removable cargo hold - one that can be adapted to suit the needs of farmers transporting vegetable harvests, or as a food truck, or for businesses that need to deliver food to restaurants.\n\nSuch flexibility may be critical for the future of minitrucks in Japan, given that the number of farmers - a core customer base for Daihatsu\u2019s no-frills, affordable vehicles - is dwindling as the country ages rapidly.\n\n\u201cThe needs of people who use minitrucks are changing, so we need to start thinking about products beyond what we\u2019ve been offering and which enable multi-functionality,\u201d said Daihatsu designer Osamu Iwanami.\n\nWhile production versions of the Hino and Daihatsu models are likely years away, Toyota has also said it is developing production models of \u201ce-Palette\u201d shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles that can be used, for instance, as mobile restaurants or offices.", "description": "In Japan, trucks are being designed for a driverless future with no cabin and interchangeable container areas that would allow vehicles to be highly customized for parcel delivery or even serve as mini-hotels or beauty salons.", "authors": ["Naomi Tajitsu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444816808&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0O6", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
