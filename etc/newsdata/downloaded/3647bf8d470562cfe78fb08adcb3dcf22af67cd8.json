I am afraid of what might happen to my family and to myself.\n\nSince its Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has refused to recognise Israel and the two have been enemies for decades. The IJF has said Iranians have thrown matches and used \u201cquestionable injuries\u201d to avoid competing against Israelis.\n\nThe IJF said Mollaei had been repeatedly ordered by the country\u2019s national Olympic committee and the government to withdraw from fights and that security personnel had been sent to his home in Iran.\n\n\u201cA few minutes prior to the (quarter-final) contest, the Iranian coach received a call from his country,\u201d the IJF said on its website. \u201cThe Iranian first deputy minister of sport, Davar Zani, gave him the order to withdraw Mollaei from the competition to avoid a potential contest between Iran and Israel.\u201d\n\nAfter winning the quarter-final, Mollaei was contacted by the president of the Olympic committee contacted Mollaei to tell him to pull out of the semi. He defied the call but lost the bout so did not make it to a final against Muki, who won gold and later called Mollaei an \u201cinspiration\u2019\u201d.\n\nMollaei said he had been told to drop out an earlier stage so it did not appear to be a boycott of Israel.\n\nIJF president Marius Vizer wrote on Twitter that Mollaei was now in Germany and was \u201cfollowing the respective procedures\u201d regarding asylum.\n\nThe Iranian team manager, Majid Zareian, criticised the IJF, saying: \u201cEverything was set in advance to put Mollaei against a participant from (Israel).\u201d He denied Iranian authorities had put pressure on Mollaei.\n\nThe IJF said it would help Mollaei prepare for next year\u2019s Olympics, also in Tokyo. If Iran refuses to enter him, he could be given a place in the International Olympic Committee-backed team of refugee athletes.\n\n\u201cI am a fighter. I want to compete wherever I can,\u201d Mollaei said. \u201cI live in a country whose law does not permit me to. We have no choice, all athletes must comply with it. All I did today was for my life, for a new life.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report", "description": "Saeid Mollaei was told to pull out of world championships to avoid possible fight with Israeli", "authors": ["Agencies In Berlin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a7c8453e84926e540bd20bc79e0ce56531a3c48/86_495_2654_1592/master/2654.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e9215f2a573a8c062651ed3458198ed3"}
