The former vice president has been accused of using his position to boost a Ukrainian energy company that was doing business with his son.\n\nIn 2014, Biden urged the dismissal of a prosecutor who oversaw investigations into the head of the gas company. The whistleblower complaint was made by an anonymous member of the intelligence community who lacked direct knowledge of the call, according to CNN.\n\nOn Sunday, Graham called for the Justice Department to launch a probe into the Biden family\u2019s business connections to Ukraine, saying, \u201cThere is enough smoke here.\u201d\n\n\u201cVirtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\u201d Trump wrote in a Thursday tweet.\n\n\u201cI would urge him to continue to be as transparent as possible and tell us as much as he can without compromising executive privilege, so that we can understand what happened,\u201d Graham said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to find more about that phone call in the coming days,\u201d Graham continued, adding that a private discussion with another world leader is \u201cone of the most privileged matters any president would have.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet ready for some disclosures from the president that I think will exceed every expectation,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you this will happen, but I think the president will clear the air when it comes to the whistleblower allegation.\u201d\n\nThe White House is reportedly considering releasing the full transcript of the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Senator Lindsey Graham on Monday said he believes Americans will be \u201csurprised about the level of transparency\u201d President Trump will offer regarding his controversial July phone call with Ukraine's president.\u201cI believe that President Trump is going to blow you away with his willingness to disclose", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wb8mCWZoCzqPxYhOeKhmdw--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/8dfa578088199851bb493c085e12bf81", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
