The armed coalition of groups lost an estimated 11,000 fighters in the years-long war against the terrorist organisation.\n\nSDF and US forces captured the last piece of Isis held territory in March 2019.\n\nThere are now growing concerns that the offensive will means less security around the prisons holding Isis members, as SDF soldiers are redeployed to the border.\n\nMr Trump claimed the US had helped the Kurdish forces financially.\n\n\u201cWe have spent tremendous amounts of money on helping the Kurds in terms of ammunition, in terms of weapons, in terms of money, in terms of pay,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s comments about the Kurdish people attracted immediate mockery online.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds contributed just as much in Normandy as Donald Trump did in Vietnam,\u201d said Rob Flaherty, the digital director of Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nTurkey views the SDF as a terrorist organisation due to its links to banned Kurdish groups inside Turkey. An SDF spokesperson said the group had been \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d by the US.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been fighting teach other for centuries, they\u2019ve been fighting each other for hundreds of years,\u201d Mr Trump said of the two groups.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said the withdrawal was a \u201cterribly unwise decision.\u201d\n\nEven Nikki Haley, Mr Trump\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations, called the move a \u201cbig mistake\u201d in a tweet.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against Isis in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMr Graham added that the move \u201censures the reemergence of Isis\u201d in the Middle East. He is concerned the removal of US troops will create a vacuum, allowing the terrorist group to possibly restore its caliphate.\n\nThere are grave concerns that Turkey\u2019s offensive could affected security around Isis prisons and camps, operated by Kurdish fighters.\n\nAn estimated 18,000 militants are being held in prisons in the region, including around 60 British citizens.\n\nThe president appeared to dismiss these fears and implied that Europe, not the US, would be facing the greater risk from Isis fighters.\n\n\u201cWell [foreign Isis fighters] are going to be escaping to Europe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where they want to go, they want to go back to their homes.\n\n\u201cBut Europe didn\u2019t want them from [the US]. We could have given it to them they could have had trials.\u201d\n\n\u201cReminder that Trump has trashed all the allies who fought with us in Normandy, and also just glibly referred to ISIS terrorists returning to Europe [because] of Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama\u2019s former deputy national security advisor.\n\nThe president has said that Turkey will face economic punishment from the US if it acts against the SDF in an inhumane manner.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re going to have to define [humane] as we go along,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how [Erdogan] does it.\n\n\u201cHe could do it in a soft manner, he could it in a very tough manner. And if he does it unfairly, he\u2019s going to pay a very big economic price.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish operation began on Wednesday.\n\nSara, a Syrian Kurd in Tal Abyad, who asked to remain anonymous, previously told The Independent the Kurdish population was particularly concerned that people would be targeted for their ethnicity by the Turkish forces.\n\n\u201cResidents are extremely scared. The air is full of tension. Children are crying and the parents are helpless,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe town is on high alert. People here are afraid of a possible genocide by the Turkish enemy.
