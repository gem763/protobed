The shutoff would hit almost one-tenth of California\u2019s population and spread to nearly 20% of the utility\u2019s total customers, spanning 36 counties. The city of San Francisco is expected to be spared.\n\nThe weekend wind storm \u201chas the potential to be one of the strongest in the last several years,\u201d PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel said. \u201cWe absolutely must be prepared for it.\u201d\n\nIt will be the third time this month that PG&E has resorted to mass blackouts to avoid wildfires. The San Francisco-based company has been taking more extreme measures since its equipment sparked blazes in 2017 and 2018, saddling it with an estimated $30 billion in liabilities and forcing it into bankruptcy. The recent widespread shutoffs, however, have led to a debate over how far California is willing to go to prevent fires during windstorms. Despite the power cuts, fires continue to burn.\n\nIn Southern California, Edison International is warning that it may cut service to more than 132,000 customers. Further south in the San Diego area, Sempra Energy said it\u2019s monitoring weather forecasts.\n\nPG&E said it expects to make a final call on the shutoffs at around 8 a.m. local time Saturday and lights would start going out at around 3 p.m. the same day. The blackout would begin in communities near Sacramento and spread within hours.\n\nGusts were forecast to reach 80 miles (130 kilometers) an hour through Monday, meaning much of the region may be powerless for two days, if not longer.\n\nWildfires are meanwhile raging at both ends of California, prompting Gavin Newsom to declare a state of emergency Friday. Near Los Angeles, blazes have prompted authorities to order 40,000 evacuations. And north of San Francisco, a fire is raging amid the vineyards of Sonoma County.\n\nThe Sonoma County fire began minutes after a PG&E transmission line in the area malfunctioned late Wednesday. Firefighters have not determined the cause of the blaze.\n\nAs the fire spread, PG&E\u2019s shares plummeted 31% Friday to $5, a record low. Shares of Edison International fell 8.5% as fires burned in its service territory in Southern California.\n\nWhile many of the fires are racing across open hillsides and scrub lands, others threaten populated areas. All told, there\u2019s about $12 billion worth of property within a mile of the active fires, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research.\n\nThe prospect of more liabilities from wildfires is especially vexing for PG&E. Since filing for Chapter 11 in January, the judge overseeing the case has warned that another big blaze would upend the utility\u2019s bankruptcy and potentially wipe out shareholders. Any claims from new fires sparked by PG&E would have to be paid out first -- and in full -- before those from previous blazes get a dime.\n\nThe winds are arriving at a precarious moment. California receives almost no rain during its summer, and a five-year drought earlier this decade killed millions of trees that can now easily ignite. Recent winds have dried out grasses and shrubs even further.\n\nAnd the threat won\u2019t end this weekend: Another front is expected to move in through Tuesday, bringing back strong, dry winds and once again, raising the risk of wildfires spreading uncontrollably.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.net;David R.
