His experience speaks for itself and will be invaluable as we drive the change required to ensure the bank can best serve a broad range of Tesco customers,\" Pimlott said.\n\nThe appointment comes a few months after Tesco Bank, with over 5.6 million customers and 10.4 billion pounds in customer deposits, said it halted mortgage lending due to stiff competition.
