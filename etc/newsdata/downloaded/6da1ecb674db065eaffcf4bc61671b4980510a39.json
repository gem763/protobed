Firms like Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 and Balyasny Asset Management are investing in extensive training programs, betting that some of their new hires will develop into alpha-producing portfolio managers who stay loyal.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t as many ready made, experienced portfolio managers in the Asia-Pacific region\u201d who gel with Point72\u2019s investment style, said Howard Man, who oversees the Stamford, Connecticut-based firm\u2019s equity-focused investment teams in Asia. Point72\u2019s 10-month training program for the region, modeled after one that the firm introduced to the U.S. in 2015, had its first Hong Kong class in March. The firm has yet to roll out a dedicated program for Europe.\n\nWhile the global hedge fund industry has faced a rocky few years as investors rebelled against high fees and lackluster returns, Asia has proven a relative bright spot thanks to stronger economic growth and expanding capital markets.\n\nCombined assets under management at funds based in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore have climbed more than 20% since 2016 to $192 billion, according to research firm Eurekahedge Pte. That compares with a 5% increase in the U.S. and a 6% drop in the U.K.\n\nHedge fund \u201cplatforms\u201d like Point72 -- which allocate money to multiple internal portfolio managers each responsible for his or her own slice of the firm\u2019s overall assets -- have been a notable source of growth in Asia.\n\nNew entrants in recent years include ExodusPoint Capital Management LP, Schonfeld Strategic Advisors LLC and Polymer Capital Management, which was founded by former Point72 Asia chief Angus Wai. The region now has at least eight major hedge fund platforms -- twice as many as in 2013 -- that oversee a combined $100 billion globally. Polymer is among those that have poached from rivals in Asia, hiring portfolio managers from both Point72 and Izzy Englander\u2019s Millennium Management LLC.\n\nGrowing demand for talent at platforms has coincided with a drop in supply from proprietary trading desks at banks, a long-time training ground for hedge funds that has been whittled down by post-2008 regulations. The resulting shortage of available managers often surprises international firms when they look to expand in Asia, said Nilay Khandelwal, managing director of Michael Page Singapore, a recruiting firm.\n\n\u201cThe challenge isn\u2019t finding a portfolio manager, it\u2019s finding a portfolio manager with the experience first hand of investing in Asia while being based in Asia,\u201d Khandelwal said. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s been here for the last five, six, seven years is in a good role, and to move them is tough.\u201d\n\nCompensation packages in Asia are increasing as hedge funds pay up to attract top candidates, people familiar with the industry said. In-demand managers can now secure more attractive terms for the performance component of their pay, which typically accounts for the bulk of their remuneration and is expressed as a percentage of the profits generated by their investments.\n\nOne person who\u2019s worked in the hedge fund industry for more than a decade said he\u2019s aware of recent bonus payouts in Asia of 25% of profits, up from 23% a few years ago, while noting that there can be significant variation across the industry.\n\nTop portfolio managers in Asia can take home $15 million to $20 million a year once performance bonuses are included, while junior portfolio managers can command $2 million to $3 million, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nCompensation in the region is still likely lower than in Europe and the U.S., but that\u2019s because Asia-based portfolio managers typically oversee fewer assets, said Will Tan, a managing director at recruitment firm Principle Partners Pte. In the U.S., star managers at big funds can make north of $50 million in a good year, Tan said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- In a glass-walled room at Point72 Asset Management LP\u2019s outpost in Hong Kong, five fresh-faced graduates pore over spreadsheets and give tentative answers to questions about cash flow and the cost of capital.These would-be masters of the universe are the first participants in Point72\u2019s", "authors": ["Bei Hu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t8Zocyd_cdPlO4oZ3gSZKQ--~B/aD03ODA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/8747c10345262e721fd02840bdb68ea1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
