As much horror as either of us wanted in our lives. We had the world at our feet.\n\n'It\u2019s been six months since Lyra was murdered. Six months that we should have spent at our happiest. We would have been engaged, building our home and enjoying our life together.\n\n'Instead it\u2019s been six months of a horror no director could properly convey, of missing her, of flashbacks to the worst experience anyone could go through.\n\n'We still don\u2019t have justice, the animal who shot my beautiful girlfriend is still walking the streets, living his utterly pointless life whilst the most amazing person I have ever known is buried in Carnmoney Cemetery.\n\n'These people have no remorse, they\u2019re brainwashed morons who are fighting a war that ended before some of them were even born.'\n\nShe added: \u2018He can never set this right, he could hand himself in, he could name the collaborators and put an end to this sorry mess... but he isn\u2019t that brave.\u2019\n\nMiss McKee, 29, had planned to propose to Miss Canning, \u2018the love her life\u2019, during a dream trip to New York two weeks after she was gunned down.\n\nShe had spoken excitedly to friends about her plans and even invited them to a wedding planned for 2021 before the tragic shooting.\n\nThe New IRA admitted responsibility for Miss McKee's death but so far no one has been charged with the murder.\n\nSara Canning (front centre), partner of murdered journalist Lyra McKee, marching with protesters through Belfast city centre demanding same sex marriage in Northern Ireland in May\n\nA mural of shooting victim Lyra McKee whose partner is calling for the person responsible for the killing to come forward\n\nThe New IRA admitted responsibility for her death but so far no one has been charged with the murder.\n\nMiss Canning spoke out days after the New IRA group, which claimed responsibility for her death, used an appearance on Channel 4 News to threaten more violence after Brexit\n\nHer death sparked a wave of calls for Northern Ireland's political parties to do away with their differences and return power sharing in Northern Ireland.\n\nMiss Canning continued: 'Lyra\u2019s life was filled with meaning, with truth seeking, wrong righting, with striving to be the best at whatever she did, at being brave and having a go even if it scared her.\n\n'The thug who took away her life will never know any of that in his own life. His future will be forever tainted by what he took away from the world.\n\n'The most he will ever amount to is that he put out a beautiful shining light, he took away someone who was seeking justice for those whose voices were not being heard, someone who listened, in spite of past wrongs, to people who wanted to set things right.\n\n'He can never set this right, he could hand himself in, he could name the collaborators and put an end to this sorry mess. But he isn\u2019t that brave.\n\n'He needs a mask and the cover of darkness, he needs a bitter middle aged woman to burn his clothes under that same darkness.\n\n'He hides behind a group who claim to work for prisoners rights, but only by recruiting more prisoners, by ruining more young lives in pursuit of a war that isn\u2019t being fought anywhere outside their own heads.\n\n'We still have no justice.'\n\nMiss Canning's tribute comes as Nichola Corner, the sister of Lyra Mckee, condemned politicians in Northern Ireland.\n\nNichola Corner, the sister of Lyra McKee, who was shot in April in the Creggan area of Londonderry during disturbances with the police, says the current Stormont stalemate is an insult to her sister's memory\n\nSpeaking at a protest at Stormont estate to mark the landmark of 1,000 days since the devolved institutions collapsed, Ms Corner said her family believed after her sister's much-publicised death and funeral, that the politicians in Northern Ireland would make a concerted effort to restore devolution.\n\n'It seems to us, Lyra's family, that Lyra's death wasn't enough for them, what is it going to take?,' she said.\n\n'Are they waiting on another Omagh? Another Shankill? Another murder?\n\n'If our Lyra's death wasn't enough to get them back to work, I don't know what will.\n\n'Maybe a reduction in salary wouldn't go amiss.\n\n'Our elected politicians continue to let their differences be barriers to progress, peace and change and transformed the word concession into a dirty word and use it to refuse to honour the will of the people and work together and blame each other for their own failure.'\n\nMany held banners and signs, and wore T-shirts adorned with Ms McKee's image and the slogan #wedeservebetter.\n\nStormont has been in cold storage for more than two and a half years due to a stand-off between Sinn Fein and the DUP on issues such as Irish language legislation and a ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nNorthern Ireland's elected Members of the Legislative Assembly continue to be paid their salaries, as well as expenses, a fact that protesters say is hypocritical while funding for public services is held up by the lack of an executive.\n\nMany made speeches about how the lack of functioning government affected their lives, from schools to healthcare.\n\nMany booed and jeered at the mention of the main political parties, and the names of leaders Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster.\n\nHopes for a new set of talks were sparked following the funeral of Ms McKee in April, although talks are ongoing, nothing substantial is expected any time soon.\n\nMiss Canning was with her girlfriend when she was shot during riots on the Creggan estate.\n\nProsecutors said this week that witnesses to Miss McKee\u2019s killer may be too afraid to come forward.\n\nThe journalist\u2019s death sparked a wave of condemnation from across the political spectrum.", "description": "Detectives believe New IRA dissident republicans were responsible for shooting the talented 29-year-old writer while she observed disturbances in Londonderry in April.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline", "Mario Ledwith For Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/19/19898274-0-image-a-2_1571424086711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
