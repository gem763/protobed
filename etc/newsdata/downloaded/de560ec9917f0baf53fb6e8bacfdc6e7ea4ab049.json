Mitt Romney (shown) and Jeff Merkley, builds on a growing campaign on the Hill at odds with the vaping industry. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Senate eyes e-cigarette crackdown\n\nThe White House has its knives out for the e-cigarette industry -- and so does Capitol Hill.\n\nSens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) have penned a new bill that largely tracks with President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on vaping, according to a draft obtained by POLITICO. The response from Congress comes amid health concerns over widespread teenager use of products such as Juul as well as vape oils possibly causing deaths and illnesses among young people in recent weeks.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMerkley and Romney's bill would ban flavors other than tobacco, create new design standards for e-cigarettes, monitor health risks for the technology, apply existing tobacco taxes to e-cigarettes and nudge the Department of Health and Human Services to run a campaign to educate Americans about any health risks of e-cigarettes. The bill also aims to derail the practice of refilling vape cartridges with home brewed tobacco mixes.\n\n\u201cWith nearly a quarter of high school students vaping regularly, we must take decisive action to prevent a new generation from addiction and serious health risks,\u201d Romney said.\n\n\u201cVaping companies have hooked millions of our children on nicotine using e-cigarette flavors like \u2018gummy bear,\u2019 \u2018scooby snacks,\u2019 and \u2018strawberries and cream.\u2019 This means massive health consequences for the next generation,\u201d Merkley added. \u201cRefillable cartridges are an invitation to hazardous concoctions, and we need to get them off the market too.\u201d\n\nThe legislation builds on a growing campaign on the Hill at odds with the vaping industry, from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-Ky.) move to raise the tobacco age to 21 to a bill from Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to take flavored products off the market. The Trump administration has also promised quick action against flavored vaping products, briefing leading senators on the issue last week after Trump\u2019s announcement of new actions against flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nThis report first appeared on politico.com on Sept. 19, 2019.", "description": "\"We must take decisive action to prevent a new generation from addiction and serious health risks,\u201d Romney says.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f1/1b/677d09a642c2841cf1dd748e6204/190919-mitt-romney-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
