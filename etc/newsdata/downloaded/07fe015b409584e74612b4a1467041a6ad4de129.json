Linhong Li found her husband in their Fresh Meadows home at 9.30pm. She called 911 and Li was taken to Jamaica hospital where he died.\n\nThe news of Li's death comes just two months after two officers shot themselves within two days of each other.\n\nSgt. Linhong Li has become the 10th NYPD cop to die by suicide after he was discovered dead by his wife at 9.30pm on Tuesday\n\nRobert Echeverria, 56, a husband and father of two, was found by his wife on August 14 in Laurelton. 35-year-old officer Johnny Rios took his life at his home in Yonkers two days before.\n\nThe string of suicides has pushed the NYPD to begin to challenge the stigma associated with mental health in policing.\n\nThey now encourage officers to seek mental health therapy if they are having any suicidal ideation.\n\nPatrick Lynch, President of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of New York City (pictured), speaks during a news conference in August 2019. Lynch released a video post that month addressed to officers who may be contemplating suicide. 'Don't f------ do it,' he said\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio, whose own father died by suicide when he was 18, tweeted at the time of Echeverria's death:\n\n'We won\u2019t let anyone struggle alone. I want every one of New York\u2019s Finest to know we are here for you. We value you. Help is available. Please reach out.'\n\n'No matter how strong or tough you are, or how difficult it may be to accept, you always deserve help when you need it. The City of New York supports you,' he added later in a letter to the department.\n\nIn a video post released in August, Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch told officers not to kill themselves in far stronger words:\n\n'Don\u2019t f----- do it.'\n\nThe news comes two months after 35-year-old officer Johnny Rios (pictured) took his life at his home in Yonkers two days before another cop, Robert Echeverria, 56, took his own life\n\n'It solves nothing and leaves devastation behind you,' he said. 'Just don\u2019t do it.'\n\nA survey of retired officers last month found that around 25 per cent had suffered from stress that lead them to consider reaching out for psychiatric help at least once in their career.\n\nHowever, only two thirds actually sought treatment for their mental health issues.\n\nNYPD\u2019s inspector general, Philip Eure has recommended that the NYPD should investigate whether mental health checks should be introduced.\n\nOnly four NYPD officers died by suicide in the whole of 2018 and averages for the past five years have been between four and five each year.", "description": "The number of New York cops to die by suicide this year reaches 10 after an  NYPD sergeant shot himself in his Queens home on Tuesday night.
