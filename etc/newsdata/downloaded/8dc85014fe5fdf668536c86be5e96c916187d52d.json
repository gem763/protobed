Mattis was a day away from resigning as Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of defense, but he tends to keep his own counsel, and he did not suggest to Mullen, his friend and former commander, that he was thinking of leaving. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. But Mullen did think Mattis appeared unusually afflicted that day. Mattis often seemed burdened in his role. His aides and friends say he found the president to be of limited cognitive ability, and of generally dubious character. Now Mattis was becoming more and more isolated in the administration, especially since the defenestration of his closest Cabinet ally, the former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, several months earlier. Mattis and Tillerson had together smothered some of Trump\u2019s more extreme and imprudent ideas. But now Mattis was operating without cover. Trump was turning on him publicly; two months earlier, he had speculated that Mattis might be a Democrat and said, in reference to NATO, \u201cI think I know more about it than he does.\u201d (Mattis, as a Marine general, once served as the supreme allied commander in charge of NATO transformation.)\n\nMullen told me recently that service in this administration comes with a unique set of hazards, and that Mattis was not unaware of these hazards. \u201cI think back to his \u2018Hold the line\u2019 talk, the one that was captured on video,\u201d Mullen said, referring to an impromptu 2017 encounter between Mattis and U.S. troops stationed in Jordan that became a YouTube sensation. In the video, Mattis tells the soldiers, \u201cOur country right now, it\u2019s got problems we don\u2019t have in the military. You just hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing it.\u201d Mullen said: \u201cHe obviously found himself in a challenging environment.\u201d Many generals and admirals worried that sustained exposure to Trump would destroy Mattis, who is perhaps the most revered living marine. Mullen\u2019s concern for Mattis was shared by many other generals and admirals, active duty and retired, who worried that sustained exposure to Trump would destroy their friend, who is perhaps the most revered living marine. Mattis had maintained his dignity in perilous moments, even as his fellow Cabinet officials were relinquishing theirs. At a ritualized praise session at the White House in June 2017, as the vice president and other Cabinet members abased themselves before the president, Mattis would offer only this generic\u2014but, given the circumstances, dissident\u2014thought: \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to represent the men and women of the Department of Defense. We are grateful for the sacrifices our people are making in order to strengthen our military, so our diplomats always negotiate from a position of strength.\u201d\n\nTo some of his friends, though, Mattis was beginning to place his reputation at risk. He had, in the fall of 2018, acquiesced to Trump\u2019s deployment of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and he was becoming contemptuous of a Pentagon press corps that was trying to perform its duty in difficult circumstances. By last December, Mattis was facing the most urgent crisis of his nearly two years in the Cabinet. Trump had just announced, contrary to his administration\u2019s stated policy, that he would withdraw all American troops from Syria, where they were fighting the Islamic State. This sudden (and ultimately reversed) policy shift posed a dire challenge to Mattis\u2019s beliefs. He had spent much of his career as a fighter in the Middle East. He had battled Islamist extremists and understood the danger they represented. He believed that a retreat from Syria would threaten the security of American troops elsewhere in the region, and would especially threaten America\u2019s allies in the anti-ISIS coalition. These allies would, in Mattis\u2019s view, feel justifiably betrayed by Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cI had no idea that he was on the precipice of resigning,\u201d Mullen told me. \u201cBut I know how strongly he believes in alliances. The practical reasons become moral reasons. Most of us believe that we\u2019ve moved on as a country from being able to do it alone. We may have had dreams about this in 1992 or 1993, but we\u2019ve moved on. We have to have friends and supporters. And we\u2019re talking about Jim Mattis. He\u2019s not going to change his view on this. He\u2019s not going to leave friends and allies on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, Mattis called John Kelly, the former Marine general who was then nearing the end of his calamitous run as Trump\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cI need an hour with the boss,\u201d Mattis said. The next day, he met Trump in the Oval Office. Mattis made his case for keeping troops in Syria. Trump rejected his arguments. Thirty minutes into the conversation, Mattis told the president, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get the next secretary of defense to lose to ISIS. I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d He handed Trump his resignation letter, a letter that would soon become one of the most famous documents of the Trump presidency thus far. Here is where I am compelled to note that I did not learn any of these details from Mattis himself. Nor did I learn them from his new book, Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead, which he wrote with the former Marine officer Bing West. The book is an instructive and entertaining leadership manual for executives, managers, and military officers. Mattis is a gifted storyteller, and his advice will be useful to anyone who runs anything. The book is not, however, an account of his time in service to the 45th president. I\u2019ve known Mattis for many years, and we spent several hours in conversation this summer, at his home in Richland, Washington, and at the Hoover Institution, on the campus of Stanford University. In these conversations, we discussed the qualities of effective leadership, the workings of command-and-feedback loops, the fragility of what he calls the American experiment, fishing the Columbia River, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, and many other topics. But about Trump he was mainly silent. I caught glimpses of anger and incredulity, to be sure. But Mattis is a disciplined man. While discipline is an admirable quality, in my conversations with Mattis I found it exasperating, because I believe that the American people should hear his answer to this question: Is Donald Trump fit for command?\n\nHe should answer the question well before November 3, 2020. Mattis is in an unparalleled position to provide a definitive answer. During moments of high tension with North Korea, he had worried that being out of reach of the president for more than a few seconds constituted a great risk. No one, with the possible exception of John Kelly, has a better understanding of Donald Trump\u2019s capacities and inclinations, particularly in the realm of national security, than James Mattis. I made this argument to him during an interview at his home, a modest townhouse in a modest development in a modest town. Mattis, who is 69, is single, and has always been so. His house serves mainly as a library of the literature of war and diplomacy, and as a museum of ceremonial daggers, the residue of a lifetime of official visits to army headquarters across the Middle East. The decor reminded me of one of his sayings: \u201cBe polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.\u201d I knew that this would be a Gallipoli of an interview, and that Mattis would be playing the role of the Ottoman gunners. But I had to try. \u201cWhen you go out on book tour,\u201d I said, \u201cpeople are going to want you to say things you don\u2019t want to say.\u201d I mentioned a scene from the book, one that concerned an ultimately successful effort to untangle a traffic jam of armored vehicles in Iraq. I noted that while this story is an edifying case study in effective leadership, it is not necessarily the sort of story that people want from him right now.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re prepared for that? For people wanting you to talk about Trump?\u201d He paused. \u201cDo you know the French concept of devoir de r\u00e9serve?\u201d he asked. I did not, I said. \u201cThe duty of silence. If you leave an administration, you owe some silence. When you leave an administration over clear policy differences, you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country. They still have the responsibility of protecting this great big experiment of ours. I know the malevolence some people feel for this country, and we have to give the people who are protecting us some time to carry out their duties without me adding my criticism to the cacophony that is right now so poisonous.\u201d \u201cBut duty manifests in other ways,\u201d I argued. \u201cYou have a First Amendment guarantee to speak your mind\u2014\u201d \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cAnd don\u2019t you have a duty to warn the country if it is endangered by its leader?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t cook up a convenient tradition here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t endanger the country by attacking the elected commander in chief. I may not like a commander in chief one fricking bit, but our system puts the commander in chief there, and to further weaken him when we\u2019re up against real threats\u2014I mean, we could be at war on the Korean peninsula, every time they start launching something.\u201d The subject of North Korea represented my best chance to wrench a direct answer from Mattis. I had collected some of Trump\u2019s more repellent tweets, and read aloud the one that I thought might overwhelm his defenses. It is a tweet almost without peer in the canon: North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that\u2019s sending me a signal? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019 Mattis looked at his hands. Finally he said, \u201cAny Marine general or any other senior servant of the people of the United States would find that, to use a mild euphemism, counterproductive and beneath the dignity of the presidency.\u201d\n\nHe went on, \u201cLet me put it this way. I\u2019ve written an entire book built on the principles of respecting your troops, respecting each other, respecting your allies. Isn\u2019t it pretty obvious how I would feel about something like that?\u201d It is. When Call Sign Chaos is refracted through the prism of our hallucinatory political moment, it becomes something more than a primer for middle managers. The book is many things, apart from a meditation on leadership. It is the autobiography of a war fighter, and also an extended argument for a forceful, confident, alliance-centered U.S. foreign policy. Read another way, though, it is mainly a 100,000-word subtweet. When I mentioned this notion to Mattis, he looked at me curiously. He is not closely acquainted with the language of social media. When I explained what a subtweet is, he said, \u201cWell, you saw that my resignation letter is in the book.\u201d It comes near the end. Each chapter contains a lesson about personal leadership, or American leadership, or some combination of the two: \u201cCoach and encourage, don\u2019t berate, least of all in public.\u201d \u201cPublic humiliation does not change our friends\u2019 behavior or attitudes in a positive way.\u201d \u201cOperations occur at the speed of trust.\u201d \u201cNations with allies thrive, and those without wither.\u201d And then comes the resignation letter, a repudiation of a man who models none of Mattis\u2019s principles: While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies \u2026\n\n\n\nMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.\n\n\n\nBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. \u201cI had no choice but to leave,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s why the letter is in the book. I want people to understand why I couldn\u2019t stay. I\u2019ve been informed by four decades of experience, and I just couldn\u2019t connect the dots anymore.\u201d \u201c \u2018With malice toward none, with charity for all,\u2019 \u201d Mattis said. \u201cLincoln said that in the middle of a war. In the middle of a war! He could see beyond the hatred of the moment.\u201d Later, during a long walk along the Columbia River, I gave it another go, asking him to describe in broad terms the nature of Trump\u2019s leadership abilities. \u201cI\u2019m happy to talk about leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cMy model\u2014one of my models\u2014is George Washington. Washington\u2019s idea of leadership was that first you listen, then you learn, then you help, and only then do you lead. It is a somewhat boring progression, but it\u2019s useful. What you try to do in that learning phase is find common ground.\u201d \u201cSo on one end of the spectrum is George Washington, and at the other end is Donald Trump?\u201d", "description": "\u201cI had no choice but to leave,\u201d General James Mattis says of his decision to resign as President Trump\u2019s secretary of defense.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/08/WEL_Goldberg_MattisOpener/facebook.jpg?1566926060"}
