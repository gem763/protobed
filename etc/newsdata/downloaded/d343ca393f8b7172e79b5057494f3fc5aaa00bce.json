(Steve Marcus/Reuters)\n\nAfter initially urging restraint, Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden has joined the majority of the Democratic primary field in calling for President Trump\u2019s impeachment, telling the crowd during a campaign speech on Wednesday that Trump has \u201calready convicted himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation, and committed impeachable acts,\u201d the former vice president said during a campaign stop in Rochester, New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cHe should be impeached,\u201d Biden said to applause.\n\nBiden previously declined to call for impeachment directly, despite being caught in the crosshairs of House Democrats\u2019 formal impeachment probe, which was prompted by Trump\u2019s attempts to have Ukraine investigate Biden and his son over the younger Biden\u2019s business dealings.\n\nDemocrats launched a formal impeachment probe against the president after a transcript of Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky showed Trump had asked Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, over allegations that the former vice president used his position to help a Ukrainian energy company avoid a corruption probe soon after Hunter was appointed to its board.\n\nLast month, Biden said that if Trump withholds information from Congress that lawmakers have requested regarding the impeachment probe he will \u201cleave Congress in my view no choice but to initiate impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe White House on Tuesday effectively said in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the chairmen of three Democratic committees that the Trump administration does not intend to cooperate with the \u201cunconstitutional\u201d impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\n\u201cBut we have to remember impeachment isn\u2019t only about what the president has done. It\u2019s about the threat the president poses to the nation,\u201d Biden added.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump will do anything to get reelected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy,\u201d Biden said, calling the president\u2019s behavior \u201cstunning\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not hyperbole,\u201d Biden assured.\n\n\u201cNo president in American history has ever dared to engage in such unimaginable behavior,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cWith his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself. By obstructing justice, refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry, he\u2019s already convicted himself.\u201d", "description": "Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden has joined the majority of the Democratic primary field in calling for President Trump's impeachment.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Kevin D.
