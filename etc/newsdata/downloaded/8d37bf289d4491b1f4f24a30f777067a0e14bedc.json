But the Bridgewater Associates founder decided to go all out for his trip to Burning Man, the annual nine-day music and arts festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert.\n\nOn Monday, Dalio tweeted a photo of himself at Burning Man sporting tie-dye from head to toe: bell-bottoms, a shirt, and a coat with blue fur fringe.\n\nIn the tweet, Dalio, 70, said Burning Man was like Woodstock but \"with better art (installations) and less good music.\" Dalio also noted that the best time to enjoy the festivities was between 1 and 5 a.m.\n\nDalio is pictured with Jeff Taylor, a senior executive at Bridgewater Associates who founded the job site Monster.\n\nBurning Man was a small gathering when it was founded in 1986 and now attracts about 70,000 people each year. But ultra-wealthy people like Dalio have been criticized for attending the counterculture festival. Dalio's tweet, for example, was met with criticism and trolling from Twitter users. One tweet said that because of the rich and famous attending, Burning Man's \"allure has been completely fabricated.\"\n\nDalio may not be known for his fashion sense, but he is known for his unusual management style. Since founding his hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, in 1975, Dalio has used what he calls \"radical transparency\" to run his company. At Bridgewater, almost all meetings are recorded, and employees can rate one another during meetings using iPads.\n\nHe's credited those management techniques with helping transform Bridgewater from a one-man operation to a hedge fund with $150 billion in assets under management.\n\nIn recent years, however, Dalio has taken a step back from management, now serving as the hedge fund's co-chief investment officer. And as Dalio's tweet shows, he's enjoying his free time.\n\nDalio's fur coat may look garish in the real world, but at Burning Man he would have fit in perfectly. Part of the reason the festival is so popular is that attendees can wear anything they want. Burners, as they're known, wear everything from feathers and wigs to bikinis. In many cases, clothing is optional.\n\nBurning Man isn't the only time Dalio has dressed up (or down) for a party. In 1976, he wore short shorts to Rio de Janeiro's Carnival.", "description": "The 70-year-old billionaire tweeted a photo of himself at Burning Man sporting the coat and lavish bell-bottoms.", "authors": ["Ivan De Luce"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c66f28a0d15f57fc14e60b3-1920-960.jpg"}
