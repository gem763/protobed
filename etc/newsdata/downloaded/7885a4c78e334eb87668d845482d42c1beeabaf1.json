(AP) - Josh Donaldson had a career-high three doubles while driving in four runs, Dansby Swanson had a career-high four hits while driving in two, and the NL East champion Braves cruised to a 10-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday night.\n\nWith their playoff seed secure and nothing on the line, the Braves sent reliever Josh Tomlin to the mound for his first start of the season. Luke Jackson (9-2) was among six relievers to go the rest of the way, helping the Braves snap a four-game skid to the Royals.\n\nOzzie Albies, Nick Markakis and Adam Duvall also drove in runs for the Braves, who get the day off Thursday before heading to New York to wrap up the regular season with three games against the Mets.\n\nThey\u2019ll host Game 1 of the divisional round Oct. 3 against the NL Central champion.\n\nMeibrys Viloria and Nicky Lopez drove in the only runs for the Royals, who lost their 101st game as they close out manager Ned Yost\u2019s career in the dugout. Yost announced Monday that he was retiring at the end of the season, which means he has just three games left against Minnesota.\n\nRoyals starter Mike Montgomery retired 10 of 11 batters beginning in the second inning before trouble struck in the fifth. The left-hander walked Albies, Donaldson followed with an RBI double, and Markakis delivered a run-scoring single to knot the game 2-all.\n\nJacob Barnes (1-4) and Heath Fillmyer were even less effective for Kansas City, coughing up the lead in the sixth by allowing three runs on three hits, two walks and a sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Braves tacked on four more runs in the eighth and another in the ninth.\n\nAWARD WINNERS\n\nINF Erick Mejia, who hit .271 with 63 RBIs, and RHP Andres Machado, who had a 2.89 ERA out of the bullpen, were the Royals\u2018 minor league players of the year from Triple-A Omaha. Other award winners were OF Khalil Lee and RHP Brady Singer at Double-A Northwest Arkansas, OF Brewer Hicklen and LHP Chris Bubic at Class A Wilmington and INF Jeison Guzman and RHP Jon Heasley at Class A Lexington.\n\nACUNA SIDELINED\n\nBraves OF Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. (left hip tightness) will sit the rest of the regular season, manager Brian Snitker said, after he left Tuesday night\u2019s game after two innings. Acu\u00f1a leads the Braves with 41 homers and is three steals shy of 40. \u201cHe could probably go with some risk,\u201d Snitker said.\n\nMONDESI SURGERY\n\nRoyals SS Adalberto Mondesi will have surgery to repair the left shoulder he hurt over the weekend, though the club hopes he will be ready by opening day next season. Mondesi hit .263 with nine homers and 62 RBIs to go with 20 doubles, 10 triples and 43 stolen bases. But he was limited to just 102 games after sustaining a subluxation to his shoulder in July, then hurting it again Sunday against Minnesota.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Braves and Royals have Thursday off before wrapping up the regular season. Mike Foltynewicz (8-5, 4.46 ERA) leads things off for Atlanta against the Mets on Friday night, and Eric Skoglund (0-2, 7.50) gets the nod for Kansas City against the Twins.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Josh Donaldson had a career-high three doubles while driving in four runs, Dansby Swanson had a career-high four hits while driving in two, and the NL East champion Braves cruised to a 10-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/braves_royals_baseball_75966_c0-179-4284-2676_s1770x1032.jpg?64bc8c2a76b50220683ad14c93dc0b3a630f2414", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
