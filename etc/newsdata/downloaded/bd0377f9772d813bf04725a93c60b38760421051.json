Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nNFL power rankings, post-Week 5 edition:\n\n1. Patriots (1): They clearly deserve top spot. But Tom Brady getting sacked season-high four times Sunday, mounting injuries show even they're vulnerable.\n\n2. Saints (3): Teddy Bridgewater is now attacking deep. The defense has elevated. Alvin Kamara isn't being overused. Drew Brees will return fresh. Things couldn't be much better after five weeks.\n\n3. Chiefs (2): Talent is undeniable, but so are emerging weaknesses \u2014 Pat Mahomes' ankle, receivers and their timing getting disrupted and defense bludgeoned for 569 rushing yards over last three weeks.\n\n4. Lions (4): If season ended today, they'd make playoffs. But with next two against Packers and Vikings, time for Detroit to prove it has staying power.\n\n5. Packers (5): Green Bay's only 1,000-yard rusher since 2010? Eddie Lacy. NFL TD leader Aaron Jones bringing depth to previously one-dimensional attack.\n\n32 things we learned: From Week 5 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWeek 5 winners, losers: Christian McCaffrey posting big numbers for Panthers; Jets, not so much\n\nMike Jones: After firing Jay Gruden, Redskins' top priority is now clear\n\n6. 49ers (8): NFC's final undefeated squad further legitimized after manhandling Browns during rookie Nick Bosa's coming-out party (2 sacks, forced fumble, fumble recovery).\n\n7. Eagles (9): They've earned share of first place atop NFC East, but it could be tough to keep with next three on road at Minnesota, Dallas and Buffalo.\n\n8. Bills (11): No team west of Foxborough playing better defense. With three in a row at home after bye, they could easily extend start to 7-1.\n\n9. Vikings (12): A get-right game was nice, but no team throwing less often. How does that jibe with diva tendencies creeping into Mike Zimmer's locker room?\n\n10. Bears (7): Who would've guessed Khalil Mack would suffer disappearing act against Oakland? Offense not good enough to survive even minor defensive lapse.\n\n11. Seahawks (17): MVP drumbeat for Russell Wilson is legitimate and deserved. But don't forget 4-1 Seattle just a few unlucky bounces from being 1-4.\n\n12. Colts (24): Justin Houston got the revenge in Kansas City that Khalil Mack could only dream of. Now it's time for Indy to heal up following impressive win.\n\n13. Cowboys (6): After feasting on Division II foes early in season, they draw D-III Jets on Sunday. But wobbling 'Boys likely won't enjoy any homecomings after that.\n\n14. Buccaneers (13): They're tough \u2014 G Alex Cappa didn't miss snap despite broken arm Sunday \u2014 and tough to beat. But league's worst pass D getting them beat.\n\n15. Rams (14): Aaron Donald has one sack. Todd Gurley isn't among league's top 15 rushers. Jared Goff isn't among top 25 rated passers. Is this sustainable?\n\n16. Ravens (16): Lots to like here, but they may also be AFC's version of Cowboys \u2014 fattening up on JV competition before struggling against varsity.\n\n17. Panthers (18): Only one player (Chris Johnson) in NFL's 100 seasons has exceeded 2,500 yards from scrimmage. Christian McCaffrey on pace for nearly 2,800.\n\n18. Texans (19): Only Russell Wilson playing more efficiently than Deshaun Watson (115.9 rating). That will be tested at K.C., Indy over next two weeks.\n\n19. Raiders (23): Good pass rushers are hard to find, Coach? Oakland got four sacks Sunday ... most since 2015 when Khalil Mack didn't have one of them.\n\n20. Chargers (10): They're below .500 at this point for fourth time in last five years. They didn't overcome any of those previous starts to reach playoffs.\n\n21. Jaguars (20): Second-year WR DJ Chark Jr. has been overshadowed by Gardner Minshew but is also one of league's surprises, leading AFC with 5 TD grabs.\n\n22. Titans (21): Special teams have given them problems all season. Tough as Tennessee is, not a good enough team to overcome missed FGs and muffed punts.\n\n23. Browns (15): Nine first downs and 180 yards? Four turnovers? Three points? Did Hue Jackson sneak back into the building?\n\n24. Giants (25): Given mothballed QB Eli Manning's penchant for slaying Patriots, don't you have to put him back in the lineup just for this week?\n\n25. Broncos (28): Apparently #FakeNews is now infiltrating the NFL, this weekend's most ridiculous rumor being the one that had Von Miller on trade block.\n\n26. Falcons (26): Want just one snapshot that something is amiss here? TE Austin Hooper has more catches (34) and receiving yards (363) than Julio Jones.\n\n27. Steelers (22): Who could have guessed they might rue that early season trade of backup QB Joshua Dobbs to Jacksonville?\n\n28. Cardinals (29): Maybe redub offense \"Ground Raid\"? It apparently works much better when Arizona runs ball (season-high 266 yards in Sunday's win).\n\n29. Bengals (30): Speaking of running the ball, Cincinnati really doesn't ... and hasn't had a rush go for more than 18 yards this season.\n\n30. Jets (27): Brutal in Sam Darnold's absence. Offense is averaging fewer than 180 yards per game and just 14.3 yards per drive. M-E-S-S, mess, mess, mess.\n\n31. Redskins (31): Advice to Jay Gruden? Grab a beer \u2014 maybe invite Trent Williams \u2014 and celebrate yeoman's work after keeping this organization relevant for most of your tenure, making Kirk Cousins a star and lasting as long as you did in a volatile environment.\n\n32. Dolphins (32): Football gods serving up an opponent in even more turmoil than Fins with 'Skins headed to Miami. Now we find out if tanking is real.\n\n(Previous ranking in parentheses)\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
