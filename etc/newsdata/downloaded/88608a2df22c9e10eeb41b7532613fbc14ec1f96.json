In the end, you\u2019ve got millionaires arguing with millionaires over who hates the millionaires the most,\u201d the TV show host said.\n\n'DIRTY JOBS' STAR MIKE ROWE FOCUSING ON REAL-LIFE AMERICANS, REFUSES TO GET PULLED INTO POLITICS\n\nThe former \"Dirty Jobs\" host then segued into a story about Ronald Reagan\u2019s acting career to further clarify his viewpoint.\n\n\u201cOne of the stories they tell [at the Reagan ranch] is the time when Ronald Reagan just finally decided he was done doing movies,\" Rowe said. \"He was just done because he was paying 92 percent of every dollar he made on films. It was just math.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t done acting,\" he continued. \"He just looked at it and did some basic calculus and said, 'Not for me anymore. Makes no sense to do this.'\u201d\n\nTOMI LAHREN: AOC SHOULD WORRY ABOUT HER OWN REELECTION, NOT ENDORSING BERNIE\n\nWhen Earhardt pondered if the wealthiest people would stop working as a result of mathematical calculations, Rowe shared a story about his home state of California.\n\n\u201cI live in California. I just read a report that said the exodus this year, as a result of a 13.5 percent state tax and some other tweaks to the system is unlike anything they\u2019ve ever seen,\" Rowe said. \"I know it\u2019s convenient \u2014 it\u2019s fun to hate the rich and all. But in the end, they\u2019re just people and they\u2019re going to do the math and they\u2019re going to go where the math is better.\"\n\nKilmeade then joined in, pondering if the concept of free money is damaging to one\u2019s self-esteem.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ignore the human condition. We\u2019re fundamentally lazy people. We have to be taught, I think, to not be lazy,\" Rowe answered. \"I\u2019m just saying that if you give me a choice \u2014 and I don\u2019t see myself as lazy \u2014 but if you give me a choice of the easy way or the hard way, I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m going to default to the easy way. Free money? I want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern with that kind of arguing is\u2026 once you say okay, free money, the next question has to be, 'Why not more?'\u201d\n\nJUDGE JEANINE DISMISSES BERNIE SANDERS' EYEBROW-RAISING CLAIM ABOUT ELIZABETH WARREN\n\nRowe was also asked about the inspiration behind his new book, \"The Way I Heard it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe book\u2026 started as a collection of stories I write for my podcast,\" he said. \u201cMy mother read them and said, 'These are very nice but it\u2019s a rather lazy approach to writing, don\u2019t you think? Publishing something you\u2019ve already read.' In between each story about a famous person I\u2019ve never met but I\u2019m intrigued by, I tell a story of my own misspent youth. The book goes between autobiography and biography. It\u2019s a memoir interrupted by some nonfiction stories about some famous people I wish I knew a little better.\u201d", "description": "Mike Rowe appeared on \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday to discuss the current economic state\u00a0of America as well as promote his new book, \u201cThe Way I Heard It.\u201d", "authors": ["Andy Sahadeo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1127621549.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
