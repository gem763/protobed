REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe company, which is backed by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, is recruiting for a rider and driver operations associate in the country, according to a job ad on professional networking site LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cYou will have the opportunity to work in a tight team, where you will launch, build and run DiDi\u2019s business in (Central) America and (the) Caribbean,\u201d states the job ad, which has not previously been reported.\n\nDidi has waged an aggressive expansion campaign in Latin America. After acquiring ride-hailing startup 99 to make inroads in Brazil in early 2018, the company built an operation from scratch in Mexico, followed by launches in Chile and Colombia.\n\nDidi\u2019s Latin American expansion has brought headaches for Uber Technologies Inc, which previously enjoyed relatively light competition in the region.\n\nUber operates in Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.\n\nA Didi spokesman confirmed the company\u2019s interest in Costa Rica but declined to provide further information.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to help even more people across the region get where they\u2019re going, and we love Costa Rica - it\u2019s a beautiful country with a vibrant culture - but we don\u2019t have any more to say about that today,\u201d the spokesman said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nOne of the most stable and prosperous countries in the region, Costa Rica could make for a solid beachhead for Didi to expand into Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nCosta Rica is also a key regional hub for Uber, giving Didi a chance to poach more of its rival\u2019s employees, said Gonzalo Araujo, a former Uber executive who is now a partner at Orza, a Bogota-based public affairs firm.\n\n\u201cThey are picking places in which they can poach people from Uber to help them grow the business,\u201d Araujo said. \u201cThey are trying to take a big bite out of Uber\u2019s revenues in the region.\u201d\n\nA Uber spokesman declined to comment.", "description": "Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is preparing to launch in Costa Rica, marking its first expansion into Central America, according to a job posting viewed by Reuters.", "authors": ["Julia Love", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441547628&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1KZ", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
