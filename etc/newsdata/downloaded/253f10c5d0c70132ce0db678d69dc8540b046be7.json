Researcher", "language": "en", "text": "Mr. DeLonge: It\u2019s really funny, I think I was kind of groomed for this job because the first time that I left Blink-182, which is a long time ago, all my fans were so angry and the public at large was like, \u201cWhy would you do that? You\u2019re crazy.\u201d [The band broke up in 2005, and reformed in 2009. Mr. DeLonge left again in 2015.]\n\nI had a list of this whole kind of reinvention of who I was, and starting my band Angels & Airwaves really gave me a way into that. I had to rebuild up from the ground, who I thought I was, who I wanted to be, where I wanted to go. By the time this happened my band didn\u2019t understand it, I couldn\u2019t tell who I was talking to. Because at the time, a lot of these guys were still in positions that are sensitive and transitioning out of government or whatever. I wasn\u2019t in a place to be able to really say everything, it just wasn\u2019t the right kind of etiquette, if you will. The guys from Blink didn\u2019t know this. But it\u2019s O.K. But I knew I was getting into waters that were so important that I had never really even touched before. Going through what I went through earlier with the band, I already had thick skin. So I didn\u2019t really care, is the short of it.\n\nYou are a musician, known for outlandish stage behavior including sometimes being naked. How did you get people to take you seriously?\n\nMr. DeLonge: That\u2019s a really good question. It was funny because, fortunately most of the people I was meeting with in the early days weren\u2019t really aware of the crazy rock and roll behaviors and antics that I\u2019ve had in my early, mid-20s. I always tell people being a celebrity got me in a few doors, but that\u2019s all it did. My intellect, whatever level it may or may not be [laughs], is what got those meetings to bear fruit. I think from my perspective, the most important thing that I was focused on was being eloquent. Being humble to the subject, because the subject is not a joke. I had to really be respectful about what I was saying, how I was saying it. I think because all those things, I earned trust and I earned more meetings. It was a process, it did not happen over night, it took me a couple years.\n\nIn July, the academy announced the ADAM (Acquisition & Data Analysis of Materials) Research Project, an academic research program focused on exotic material samples from U.F.O.s. How will the academy conduct research on the materials and what exactly is it looking for?\n\nMr. Elizondo: We\u2019re going to do research employing the scientific method, first and foremost. What we have been doing is trying to find the most qualified individuals at the most respectable institutions to conduct scientific analysis. That scientific analysis includes physical analysis, it includes molecular and chemical analysis and ultimately it includes nuclear analysis.", "description": "Two years after Mr. DeLonge left the band, he found a new life trying to make sense of outer space.", "authors": ["Derrick Bryson Taylor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/multimedia/00xp-ufo1/00xp-ufo1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
