A whistleblower with second- or third-hand information alleges wrongdoing within the Trump administration. It gets leaked with allegations that the administration tried to quash it, only to find out that the House committee had the relevant information for months.\n\nGet ready for Whistleblower II: Audit Boogaloo:\n\nAn Internal Revenue Service official has filed a whistleblower complaint reporting that he was told at least one Treasury Department political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president or vice president\u2019s tax returns, according to multiple people familiar with the document. Trump administration officials dismissed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as flimsy because it is based on conversations with other government officials. But congressional Democrats were alarmed by the complaint, now circulating on Capitol Hill, and flagged it to a federal judge. They are also discussing whether to make it public.\n\nBy golly, with a nip here and a tuck there, this would sound just like Ukraine-Gate, right? It even comes complete with suggestions of a cover-up, as well as an almost instant debunking of it later in the report. The administration didn\u2019t dismiss it in terms of attempting to put an end to it, but simply by saying it wasn\u2019t credible. Ways and Means Committee chair Richard Neal already had it, and he\u2019s already used it in court:\n\nRep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee who received the whistleblower\u2019s complaint in July, said in court filings this summer that the complaint contains credible evidence of \u201cpotential \u2018inappropriate efforts to influence\u2019 the audit program.\u201d Neal has also said the complaint raises \u201cserious and urgent concerns.\u201d \u2026 Two administration officials have described the complaint as hearsay and suggested it was politically motivated, but they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Democrats who have reviewed it regard it as a deeply significant allegation that, if true, suggests that political appointees may have tried to interfere with the government audit process, which was set up to be insulated from political pressures.\n\nIf it\u2019s secondhand, it\u2019s only \u201cdeeply significant\u201d if one can corroborate it. Otherwise, it\u2019s gossip, albeit pitch-perfect gossip for Democrats in the same way the Ukraine-Gate whistleblower report was \u2014 in fact, in precisely the same way and manner. If Neal and other House Democrats could have corroborated that in the past three months, we\u2019d be having open hearings on it by now.\n\nAlso, it seems curious that Pence\u2019s name got attached to this. Has anyone ever suggested that Pence was the subject of an IRS audit before now? There was a \u201cmandatory audit that the Internal Revenue Service does on the vice president,\u201d the Wall Street Journal noted in 2017, but no hint that the IRS was doing any other kind of investigation into Pence\u2019s taxes. Unlike Trump, Pence released his tax returns to the public, too. That\u2019s a strange kind of ambiguity on the person targeted by the audit and helped by the alleged interference. It\u2019s almost as if this leak was designed to snare Pence by innuendo into the Democrats\u2019 crosshairs. I wonder why someone would want to do that.\n\nNow that this has leaked, expect it to get plenty of attention. Hopefully media outlets will choose more wisely than the Washington Post did for expert commentary on proper IRS procedures and investigations. Guess who the Post called? It\u2019s not Lois Lerner, but it\u2019s close:\n\n\u201cNobody at the Treasury Department should be calling to find out the status of anybody\u2019s audit,\u201d said John Koskinen, who served as IRS commissioner under both Trump and President Barack Obama. \u201cFor a Treasury official to call a career person \u2014 even just for information \u2014 seems to me highly inappropriate, even if it\u2019s just checking in on how it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nEr \u2026 there seems to be a little left out of Koskinen\u2019s bio, including the fact that he stonewalled Congress over his lack of action in the Lerner scandal. He told Congress at one point that the records detailing the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS\u2019 tax-exempt squad had been destroyed, only to have them turn up later. That nearly got Koskinen impeached, and probably should have. At other times, Koskinen nearly got found in contempt for stonewalling the courts as well. The last expert on anyone\u2019s list of experts on proper and ethical IRS operations is Lerner\u2019s, but Koskinen would be in the slot right above her.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to take any report that uses Koskinen as an ethics coach seriously, but that\u2019s not the real measure of the issue either. This could still be serious if someone in Trump\u2019s circle was stupid enough to peek over the shoulders of the IRS about his audit. That seems unlikely but not impossible; given the months that have gone by, however, it also seems as though Democrats already came up empty on this one.", "description": "The WaPo expert on IRS ethics is ...
