Here's What She Just Put Him On Blast For.", "language": "en", "text": "Gun owner Lauren Boebert confronted 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke for his \"hell yes, we'll take your AR-15\" proposal to confiscate firearms from American citizens. She said what we all think: \"Hell no you won't.\" But she also wanted to know how O'Rourke plans to use legislation to take away law-abiding Americans' right to keep and bear arms.\n\nThis woman is amazing. She\u2019s the kind of person Beto wants to dissent\n\n\n\nMOLON LABE. pic.twitter.com/SfJgSuNTNj \u2014 Beth Baumann (@eb454) September 22, 2019\n\nShe appeared on \"Fox and Friends\" on Saturday to expand on her comments.\n\n\"I heard that Beto was coming to my state of Colorado to talk about gun control or maybe gun legislation and I heard what he had to say about taking away our Second Amendment rights and our firearms and I really just wanted to go down there and reverse his statement and tell him absolutely not,\" she explained. \"I'm sure that's every gun-owning American's immediate response to his 'hell yes' was an immediate, firm, 'hell no.'\"\n\nSpecifically, she took issue with Beto holding a gun control rally in Aurora, Colorado, a clear play on the 2020 movie theater shooting that left 12 dead.\n\n\"O'Rourke is painting the picture, Lauren, that everyone is ready, now at this point, to support him in this gun legislation. What do you say?\" host Griff Jenkins asked.\n\n\"That is absolutely false,\" she said. \"Shame on him for coming to Colorado to expound upon our tragedies -. Those are our victims and he came here to paint a picture for his own campaign trail and really, shame on you, sir, for doing that. We were here. We experienced those losses. That was a community loss.\"\n\nAccording to Boebert, the Aurora victims were left defenseless, but disarming law-abiding gun owners wouldn't have prevented the tragedy.\n\n\"There were criminals that did those horrible acts and, by definition, those criminals do not obey the laws. There is no legislation that you can pass that is going to stop the evil in a man's heart,\" she explained. \"If he has a desire to go out and harm someone, he will find a way to do that.\"\n\nShe called on the Trump administration to honor and defend the Second Amendment.\n\n\"The administration absolutely needs to take a stand now, today, and say, 'We will honor the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,\" Boebert said. \"We support our president. I love my president and I implore him. Please, protect our Second Amendment. We elected you to do just that. We don't want anything inched away because every little thing that's on the chopping block will eventually will lead to no ownership of firearms in America.\"\n\nWatch the latest video at foxnews.com", "description": "Shots.
