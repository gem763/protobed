She was extradited to the United States in August\n\nThe extradition order also requires that Francis serve her sentence in Suffolk County, Long Island, rather than the notorious Rikers Island detention facility.\n\nActing Queens District Attorney John Ryan says Francis injected Mayhew's buttocks with silicone gel purchased from eBay in the basement of her home in the Far Rockaway neighborhood on May 30, 2015.\n\nAuthorities say the silicone entered Mayhew's bloodstream and killed her.\n\n'In pleading guilty, the defendant has now admitted to causing the death of a young woman who sought a cosmetic procedure at a discount and paid with her life,' Ryan said.\n\n'The defendant set up shop in the basement of a Far Rockaway home using a massage table for an examination table and silicone gel that had been purchased from the website Ebay.\n\nMayhew, a television producer from Maryland, paid $1,600 to have the procedure in Francis' basement in 2015\n\n'The victim in this case traveled from Maryland with her mother and paid $1,600 cash for the injections.\n\n'Sadly, the treatment killed her.\n\n'She went into cardiac arrest as the defendant pumped a clear liquid substance into the woman\u2019s backside.\n\n'The defendant, who fought extradition, will serve time behind bars as a result of her actions.'\n\nFrancis fled to London and was extradited in August.\n\nAuthorities said she began showing signs of distress after her second injection of silicone\n\nMayhew, 34, and her mother had traveled from their home in Suitland, Maryland, for the procedure.\n\nAccording to authorities, Mayhew began showing signs of distress after she was administered a second injection.\n\nHer mother dialed 911. Emergency responders found Mayhew lying unresponsive face up at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nShe was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead, according to the District Attorney's Office.\n\nThe medical examiner determined that the official cause of death was systemic silicone emboli.\n\nFrancis fled the scene and left the country the next day, according to Ryan.\n\nThe botched procedure was performed in the basement of Francis' home in Far Rockaway, Queens (above)\n\nFrancis' attorney, Kevin O'Donnell, says his client is 'incredibly remorseful.'\n\nFrancis fought extradition to the U.S., but a British judge ruled in October that the severity of the crime necessitated that the mother-of-one be sent to New York for trial.\n\nFrancis' daughter will be cared for by her maternal grandmother during the course of her sentence.\n\nFrancis was found to be suffering from a non-psychotic moderate to severe depressive episode.", "description": "Donna Francis (left), 39, pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide during a hearing at Queens County Criminal Court on Friday.
