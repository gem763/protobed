A new mobile wireless entrant that starts with zero postpaid subscribers and that must rely on its much bigger rival, the new T-Mobile, just to operate is not a competitor. It's a mobile Frankenstein.\"\n\nT-Mobile CEO John Legere noted in a statement that the Dish deal won't change \"previously announced target synergies, profitability and long-term cash generation\" projections.\n\nDish Chairman Charlie Ergen said the deal will help fulfill two decades of work and more than $21 billion in spectrum investments. Dish also notes in a press release that the deal requires it to \"use its spectrum to deploy a nationwide 5G broadband network covering at least 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 14, 2023\" or else \"make voluntary contributions to the U.S. Treasury of up to $2.2 billion.\u201d\n\nWhat's next: A court will have to approve the deal, and 10 other states have separately sued to block it. Those states have asked the court for more time in the event of a DoJ settlement that changed the terms of the deal, as is now the case.", "description": "The combined company will have to sell a variety of assets to Dish Network.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/0NYhkpzueaJ5QUwilKOe4D-_tbo=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/07/26/1564152277585.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-26"}
