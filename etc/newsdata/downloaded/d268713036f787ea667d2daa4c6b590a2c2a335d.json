This once-over-lightly approach is perhaps appropriate, given that Stritch was not inclined to introspection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOpening with a vivid account of the 2014 memorial service for Stritch in a Broadway theater, Jacobs characterizes her subject as \u201crestless and routinized, selfish and generous, straightforward and elliptical,\u201d a woman who \u201cinsisted on being seen and heard, felt and dealt with.\u201d It\u2019s all rather glib, as is the jab that Stritch was \u201ca girl from a family who put the convent in conventional,\u201d followed 12 pages later by the information that \u201cthe Stritches were committed but not strict Catholics.\u201d Consistency doesn\u2019t unduly concern Jacobs if it gets in the way of a good one-liner.\n\nStritch would probably be fine with that. \u201cI was the girl who sang the songs and told the jokes,\u201d she told a reporter in 1961. \u201cI figured the only way to make people love me was to be a million laughs.\u201d As that quote indicates, Stritch didn\u2019t lack self-awareness; she simply preferred to focus on having fun, onstage and off, and making sure everyone knew about it. Shortly after she arrived in New York from suburban Detroit, in 1943, she was getting frequent mentions from gossip columnists like Walter Winchell and Dorothy Kilgallen for her saloon-hopping and high-profile dates with producer Jed Harris. Jacobs follows the columnists\u2019 example by giving plenty of space to Stritch\u2019s drinking and her relationships with Gig Young, Ben Gazzara and quite a few others before her 1973 marriage to fellow actor (and fellow alcoholic) John Bay.\n\nMeanwhile, Jacobs\u2019s show-by-show narrative captures the professional life of a working actor in the commercial theater. Stritch made her first big splash with the mock-striptease number \u201cZip\u201d in a 1952 revival of \u201cPal Joey\u201d and received Tony nominations for her work in William Inge\u2019s 1955 drama, \u201cBus Stop,\u201d and Noel Coward\u2019s 1961 musical, \u201cSail Away.\u201d But she also gained a reputation as a lush, difficult with directors and a selfish performer who made sure the spotlight was always on her. By 1969, she had become \u201can obvious employment risk,\u201d according to Jacobs, when Harold Prince and Stephen Sondheim cast her in \u201cCompany.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStritch was such a smash in the iconic role of Joanne that she negotiated a 50 percent raise for the show\u2019s run in London. She met Bay there and stayed for the rest of the 1970s, starring in a few plays and a TV sitcom. She even quit drinking for several years, but Bay\u2019s death, after their return to New York in 1982, pushed her off the wagon, and she hit bottom after her parents died in 1987. Stritch went to AA and loudly proclaimed her sobriety, although her commitment was, in fact, intermittent. It\u2019s all part of a jaundiced picture that Jacobs paints of the decade that followed, marked by unprofessional episodes fueled by a sense of entitlement that was, according to composer Larry Grossman, \u201cnot commensurate with who she was.\u201d (Jacobs has a habit of using quotes from others to make points she seems unwilling to make directly.)\n\nWith \u201cAt Liberty,\u201d Stritch went from being dismissed as a past-her-prime prima donna to being hailed as a theatrical legend and charming scamp. A surge of late-life activity included a regular guest-star stint on NBC\u2019s \u201c30 Rock,\u201d cabaret performances at Cafe Carlyle, and, at age 85, her final Broadway appearance, as Madame Armfeldt in a 2010 revival of \u201cA Little Night Music.\u201d She did her last show at the Carlyle in 2013, shortly before moving back to Michigan to spend her last year among her surviving relatives.\n\nStritch\u2019s tumultuous life and career make an absorbing story, which Jacobs tells briskly and readably. Readers looking for something deeper than the standard showbiz biography will wish that \u201cStill Here\u201d displayed greater empathy and insight when discussing Stritch\u2019s frequently bad behavior, so obviously rooted in insecurities and anxieties whose origins Jacobs might have done more to explore. For those content with a capable recounting of a colorful life, \u201cStill Here\u201d will do just fine.\n\nWendy Smith is the author of \u201cReal Life Drama: The Group Theatre and America, 1931-1940.\u201d\n\nSTILL HERE\n\nThe Madcap, Nervy, Singular Life of Elaine Stritch\n\nBy Alexandra Jacobs\n\nFarrar, Straus & Giroux.\n\n352 pp. $27.00\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cBroadway\u2019s enduring dame\u201d probably would have approved of Alexandra Jacobs\u2019s \u201dStill Here.\u201d", "authors": ["Wendy Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Mwj2qxxdlczkErcf3l2LA8Q3oIo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HCFGVKXJH4I6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
