Boogie listed at 6-11, Durant at 6-9. pic.twitter.com/E2OIJwXKVS \u2014 Adam Zagoria (@AdamZagoria) June 29, 2016\n\n\u201cI keep telling him to stop standing by me, man,\u201d Cousins said jokingly at the time, according to Sporting News. \u201cI think people are starting to figure out, I might be about 6-7. He\u2019s every bit of 7 feet, every bit.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear Durant is just as tall as his counterparts, if not taller. He actually addressed the height controversy earlier that year in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, asserting bluntly that he\u2019s actually 6-foot-11.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough Durant will be sidelined with an Achilles\u2019 injury in his first season with the Brooklyn Nets, we\u2019ll finally learn this year how tall he and other NBA players truly measure. The New York Times\u2019 Marc Stein reported Tuesday the league told teams this week that they must submit the \u201cprecise height and age\u201d for every player.\n\nNBA spokesman Mike Bass confirmed the report to The Washington Post late Thursday, adding: \u201cA consistent process has been created to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data on team rosters.\u201d\n\nThis year, heights will be recorded definitively by measuring players with their shoes off, according to Stein. The rules for weight will be less strict because the number changes so frequently for many players.\n\nAD\n\nOn the opposite side of the height spectrum from Durant is Dallas Mavericks guard J.J. Barea, who has been listed as 6 feet tall but told the Journal he\u2019s actually \u201c5-foot-10 on a good day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEmbellishing your height is commonplace in society (particularly in men\u2019s dating profiles). But advertising yourself as shorter than reality is less common. Durant\u2019s reason for rounding down all these years was to play his preferred position \u2014 and to have a little fun.\n\n\u201cFor me, when I\u2019m talking to women, I\u2019m 7 feet \u2026 In basketball circles, I\u2019m 6-9.\u201d Durant told the Journal. \u201cReally, that\u2019s the prototypical size for a small forward. Anything taller than that, and they\u2019ll start saying, \u2018Ah, he\u2019s a power forward.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nLater, he told KNBR he fibs about his height because \u201cI just like messin\u2019 with people.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019ll be no more messin\u2019 with people anymore. And that goes for representing the correct age, too, though there are likely fewer false instances of that in the NBA.\n\nThe league\u2019s focus on age seems to have stemmed from an issue last year with Sacramento Kings\u2019 guard Buddy Hield. In December, Hield acknowledged he\u2019d recently turned 26, even though the NBA had listed him at 25. He blamed the league for the disparity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKings\u2019 Buddy Hield says he\u2019s a year older than he\u2019s been listed by the NBA\n\n\u201cI came over with a passport,\u201d Hield, who is from the Bahamas, told NBC Sports Bay Area. \u201cMy passport has 1992 on it. My driver\u2019s license has 1992 on it. I just think people got their information from Wikipedia or wherever, and they just went with it. They just got it wrong.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead More NBA:\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox\n\nAdam Silver on NBA\u2019s stricter tampering rules: Fans \u2018were losing confidence in our system\u2019\n\nNBA fines Bucks for tampering with Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is on the Bucks\n\nAn ode to the NBA\u2019s \u2018ninja-style\u2019 headbands: Gone but not forgotten\n\nDoc Rivers talks Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and how the Clippers pulled off deal of the decade\n\nAD", "description": "It\u2019s no secret there are some questionable height listings in the NBA.
