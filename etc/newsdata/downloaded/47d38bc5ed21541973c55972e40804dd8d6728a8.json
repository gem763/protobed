Pompeo Preaches to Pro-Israel Christian Confab", "language": "en", "text": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a pointedly religious speech Monday that sounded like he was rallying fellow Pro-Israel Christians around the inevitably of a U.S. confrontation with Iran.\n\nPompeo delivered his 2,000-plus word speech, titled \u201cThe U.S. and Israel: a Friendship for Freedom,\u201d before a 5,000-plus gathering of Christians United for Israel (CUFI) in Washington, D.C. Led by founder and chairman John Hagee, the annual event also boasted speeches from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Vice President Pence, and National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton.\n\nIn other words, every member of Trump\u2019s inner circle who has spent the last several weeks of escalating tensions banging the drums of war against Iran.\n\nMembers of CUFI, which calls itself the largest pro-Israel organization in the U.S., have been spending the early part of the week lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill. \u201cFourteen years ago, I invited 400 of America\u2019s leading evangelicals to come to Cornerstone Church in San Antonio to give birth to CUFI. Today, by the grace of God, we are seven million-plus standing united in defense of Israel and the Jewish people,\u201d Hagee told the crowd assembled in the cavernous Washington Convention Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPompeo was clearly taking his case against Iran to Hagee\u2019s faithful in his own remarks Monday, beginning with a brief history lesson on the modern state of Israel, and then asking the audience to \u201ccompare Israel\u2019s reverence for liberty with the restrictions on religious freedom facing Christians and people of all faiths throughout the rest of the Middle East,\u201d where \u201cif a Muslim leaves Islam it is considered an apostasy, and it is punishable indeed by death.\u201d\n\nFrom lines like \u201ccan I get an amen?\u201d to \u201cthis is what it must have looked like to be part of the crowd for the fishes and loaves,\u201d Pompeo\u2019s address was filled with religious metaphors that were right on cue for the massive Evangelical convocation.\n\n\u201cChristian support in America for Zion\u2014for a Jewish homeland\u2014runs back to the early Puritan settlers, and it has endured for centuries,\u201d said Pompeo. \u201cIndeed, our second president, a couple years back, said\u2026 \u2018I really wish the Jews again in Judea an independent nation.'\u201d\n\nThe speech was posted on the State Department website and emailed to all subscribers. With \u201cChristians United for Israel\u201d emblazoned behind him, Pompeo spoke in biblical language, invoking President Harry Truman\u2019s support for the creation of the modern state of Israel after World War II: Pompeo\u2019s Selective \u2018Rights Talk\u2019\n\nNo one\u2014no one was more grateful for Truman\u2019s brave decision than the Jewish people themselves. In 1949, Israel\u2019s Chief Rabbi came to see President Truman. He told him, he said, \u2018God put you in your mother\u2019s womb so that you could be the instrument to bring about the rebirth of Israel after two thousand years.\u2019 And as the story goes, tears filled the president\u2019s eyes. The Rabbi then opened the Bible and read the words of King Cyrus \u2013 a real friend to Israel. It was from the Book of Ezra. He read that \u2018The Lord God of Heaven hath given me all the kindness of the earth; and he hath charged me to build Him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.\u2019 It fills me with unending pride to know that American hands helped build the modern house of Israel.\n\nPompeo then pivots.\n\nIn Iraq, Syria, and other countries in the region, the last remnants of ancient Christian communities are at near-extinction because of persecution from ISIS and other malign actors. And just one example: before 2003, there were an estimated 1.5 million Christians living in Iraq. Today, sadly, almost a quarter of a million.\n\n\n\nPompeo doesn\u2019t mention that the U.S. intervention in Iraq was the catalyst for the destruction of that country\u2019s religious minorities.\n\nPledging that the Trump administration will ensure that \u201cthe flame of existence of Christians must not be snuffed out,\u201d Pompeo then turns to religious persecution inside Iran. Not surprisingly, he makes no mention of the religious persecution taking place in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both U.S. allies and notorious human rights violators.\n\nPersecution of the faithful is especially intense inside the Islamic Republic of Iran. The regime\u2019s militant adherence to the noxious tenets of the Islamic Revolution dictates all elements of life \u2013 and especially the suppression of other faiths.\n\nIn Iran, if Muslims try to convert non-Muslims, the penal code calls for a death sentence. The government does not recognize converts to Christianity. It levies beatings and solitary confinement on Christians caught worshiping in violation of government dictates.\n\nPompeo then mentions the 10-year prison sentences that were upheld last year against \u201cfour Iranian Christians who were \u2018acting against national security\u2019 by\u2026 \u2018promoting Zionist Christianity\u2019\u2026 and running house churches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something we know in America,\u201d said Pompeo, who added that authorities \u201craided their homes, beat them, and used electroshock weapons on them. They then threw them into Evin Prison \u2013 a regime dungeon inside of Tehran.\u201d\n\nIt is nothing new that Iran has imprisoned Christians for years; but what does all this have to do with Israel?\n\nHere\u2019s where Pompeo stitches it all together:\n\nA lot of people get spun up with the wrong ideas that American evangelicals want to impose a theocracy on America. I wish they would be concerned about the real theocratic takeover that has been happening in Iran for the last four decades. The ayatollahs have grievously deprived the Iranian people of that most basic, simple, fundamental right, their right to worship. That same twisted, intolerant doctrine that fuels persecution inside Iran has also led the ayatollah and his cronies to cry out, quote, \u201cdeath to Israel\u201d for four decades now. This is similar to a cry that came out of Iran \u2013 then called Persia \u2012 many, many years ago.\n\nPompeo then cites the Biblical book of Esther because it \u201cteaches us about this.\u201d\n\nIt was in the 5th century B.C. There was a wicked advisor named King Xerxes. A fellow named Haman hatched a plot to kill all the Jews in the Persian Empire. He secretly wrote letters with the king\u2019s seal to all the provincial governors, ordering the people to rise up and attack the Jews. This edict, once issued, could not be revoked. But thanks to the courageous intervention of Queen Esther, who begged the king to show mercy to her people, Haman\u2019s plot was exposed and the Jews were ultimately spared. Today this marks the Jewish holiday of Purim and it commemorates this amazing miracle.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: Purim was celebrated on March 21, almost four months before Pompeo gave this speech to the Christians United for Israel. More so, Pompeo was actually with Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the 2019 Purim holiday. In fact, the actual content of Netanyahu\u2019s March speech is not much different from Pompeo\u2019s July transcript. Netanyahu connects the Purim holiday and the persecution of Jews by the Persian Haman to \u201ctoday, 2,500 years later, again Persians, led by Khamenei, are trying to destroy the Jewish people and the Jewish state. They are going to fail again.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Pompeo says that he \u201cwanted to tell\u201d the story of Esther for a few reasons, namely that \u201cthe Jews have had a target on their back in every era of history. And as the Book of Ecclesiastes says, \u2018There is [indeed] nothing new under the sun.\u2019 \u2026We\u2019ve cut off billions in funds that the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s leadership would have used for various nefarious purposes, not the least of which would have been their efforts to destroy the state of Israel\u2026 under President Trump, the Israel haters such as Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad receive far less blood money from Iran to pursue their terrorism than ever in recent history. President Trump has, too, maintained the $4 billion annual security assistance to Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur country is intended to do all it can, in cooperating with other nations, to help create peace and preserve peace [throughout] the world,\u201d Pompeo concluded. \u201cIt is given to defend the spiritual values \u2013 the moral code \u2013 against the vast forces of evil that seek to destroy them.\u201d\n\nBarbara Boland is The American Conservative\u2019s Foreign Policy and National Security Reporter.
