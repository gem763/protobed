This week marked a notable fashion first for the singer-songwriter, who hit the 2019 GQ Men of the Year Awards in London in a pair of black Gucci heels.\n\nThe four-time Grammy winner posted a snapshot of his footwear on Instagram, along with a caption describing Tuesday night\u2019s personal significance.\n\n\u201cTonight I wore heels for the first time to an award show,\u201d wrote Smith, who publicly identified as genderqueer and nonbinary earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019ve just got home from a gorgeous evening and as I was walking to my front door I stopped and listened to my heels clonking against the floor. And I just thought \u2018FUCK YES\u2019!!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a time where I thought I\u2019d never ever ever be able to be myself like this in front of the industry or anyone,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cThey\u2019ll always be my virgin heels.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, he posted a photo showing his complete red carpet look.\n\nWhile the heels were making their award show debut, the 27-year-old has been embracing gender-bending fashion for some time.\n\n\u201cI love a heel,\u201d he told The Sunday Times in 2017. \u201cI\u2019ve got loads of heels at home.\u201d It\u2019s a point he\u2019s since emphasized on social media with numerous images of him wearing platforms and stilettos.\n\nIncidentally, Smith is set to pay tribute to another Hollywood icon known for fabulous footwear.\n\nHe\u2019s slated to appear on the soundtrack of the new Judy Garland biopic, \u201cJudy,\u201d performing \u201cGet Happy\u201d as a duet with the film\u2019s star, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. The movie hits theaters Sept. 27.", "description": "The four-time Grammy winner showed off his Gucci footwear at the GQ Men of the Year Awards. \"It feels so good,\" he said.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d702a3b2400004f0074aec6.jpeg?cache=xr5oqxilaw&ops=1778_1000"}
