Kluin and Xinran Y. Lehto, hospitality and tourism scholars, found in a 2012 study of 300 U.S. adults who\u2019d attended at least one such gathering. Rarely do people explicitly partake in these events for more typical vacation purposes (such as relaxation), the researchers found. Rather, they do so to maintain and remember family history, to engage in activities as a group, and to grow closer to one's spouse and children or familiarize those children with their extended family. These people see reunions \u201cas an effective means of creating an 'altogether atmosphere,\u2019\" of \u201cfostering the feeling of being close to each other,\u201d and of experiencing \u201clove and belonging\u201d\u2014a draw that the researchers suspect grows more intense the more geographically scattered families become.\n\nAdditionally, at a time when nearly half of Americans report feeling lonely at least sometimes, the multigenerational connections forged by family reunions can contribute to familial cohesion. Kluin and Lehto concluded that Americans are especially drawn to family reunions in this day and age, perhaps in part because of an \u201cincreasing emphasis on the basic values of family togetherness in contemporary society.\u201d\n\nRead: Millennials are keeping family holiday cards alive\n\nAmericans are drawn to reunions even if, at times, the gatherings can be stressful. \u201cPeople in general realize that family trips are rarely easy\u2014they rarely go as planned,\u201d says Jason Dorsey, a consultant who researches Millennials and serves as president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, a consulting firm whose research seeks to dissolve the siloes separating different age groups. Yet, Dorsey continued, \u201cthey still decide to do it [a family reunion] again.\u201d A family reunion is kind of like a workout: No matter how apprehensive a person feels going into it, or how beat she feels coming out, she continues to partake in the ritual because it\u2019s so nourishing.\n\nIn text messages, Roberts explained that his T-shirt design was inspired by his grandpa Maynard, who loved to tell his younger kin \u201cstories that\u2019d he\u2019d populate with these specific creatures of his invention.\u201d He\u2019d often simulate \u201cconvincing-enough\u201d encounters with those invented monsters during regular \u201cnighttime haunted walks\u201d through his \u201calmost-pastoral backyard.\u201d Those kids are, like Roberts, now adults. The terror Maynard once instilled in them has since evolved into nostalgia\u2014for their gullibility, for the make-believe, and, of course, for Maynard.\n\n\u201cThe great part is that these stories were so pervasive, the shirt connected instantly with all the aunts, uncles, and cousins equally, as we all had encountered them together and apart as long as Maynard lived to be able to tell them,\u201d Roberts told me. \u201cIt was almost as if that side of the family had a shared zeitgeist that only existed among all of us.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
