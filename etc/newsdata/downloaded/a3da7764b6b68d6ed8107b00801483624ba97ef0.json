Habibie in 1998. Singapore Press Holdings\n\nEver since former Indonesian President Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie described Singapore as a \u201clittle red dot\u201d in 1998, the term has become synonymous with the island nation, whose citizens use it as a symbol of how strong and wealthy it has become despite a lack of resources.\n\nSo when Habibie died on Thursday (September 11) at the age of 83, many Singaporeans who are old enough to remember his short 17-month presidency in the late \u201990s were reminded of the time he reportedly said he did not feel Singapore was a friend of Indonesia\u2019s.\n\nBut what did Habibie \u2013 who was known for kick-starting Indonesia\u2019s democratic reforms and East Timor\u2019s independence referendum \u2013 actually mean when he described Singapore as a \u201cred dot\u201d?\n\nHere\u2019s what happened, according to archived newspaper reports:\n\nIn early August of 1998, then-president Habibie was quoted by the Asian Wall Street Journal (ASWJ) as saying that he didn\u2019t get a feeling of friendship from Singapore.\n\n\u201cYou see, a friend in need is a friend indeed. I don\u2019t have that feeling from Singapore,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\n\u201cI have that feeling from the US, from Japan, Australia, mainland China, from Malaysia, from Europe, Germany,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an article, The Straits Times reported that the comment came after Habibie told the Journal that he did not receive a congratulatory letter from the Republic until it was \u201calmost June, very late\u201d. The article said the president assumed office on May 21, and Singapore\u2019s then-prime minister Goh Chok Tong\u2019s letter was dated May 25.\n\nComparing Indonesia\u2019s relations with other countries to its ties with Singapore, Habibie reportedly said: \u201cJapan, Malaysia, who is so close, they are pro-active. And yet (Singapore) doesn\u2019t have that. They are pro-active in the negative direction, and that, I feel so sorry for.\u201d\n\nB.J. Habibie, when he was Indonesia\u2019s state minister for research and technology, in a meeting with Lee Kuan Yew. Lianhe Zaobao\n\nHis \u201cred dot\u201d comment came as he pointed to a map of Indonesia and the surrounding region.\n\nAccording to ASWJ, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s OK with me, but there are 211 million people (in Indonesia).\n\n\u201cLook at that map. All the green is Indonesia. And that red dot is Singapore. Look at that,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nGoh Chok Tong referenced \u201cred dot\u201d remark at National Day Rally\n\nThat same month, Goh Chok Tong referenced Habibie\u2019s \u201cred dot\u201d remark in his National Day Rally speech.\n\nReferring to the crisis Indonesia was facing at the time, the premier said Singapore had vested interests in Indonesia, and will help Indonesia \u201cwithin the limits of our ability\u201d.\n\nThen-prime minister Goh Chok Tong and Habibie in November 1998. Lianhe Zaobao\n\nHowever, he also said that Singapore was a small economy and its ability to help was limited to an extent. He said: \u201cWe are not in the same class. After all we are only three million people. Just a little red dot on the map. Where is the capacity to help 211 million people?\u201d\n\nIn that same year, Singapore pledged a S$12 million humanitarian aid package to Indonesia to aid their recovery efforts after the 1997 financial crisis and May 1998 riots, The Business Times reported. At the time, it was the largest aid amount Singapore had ever extended to any country.\n\nLee Hsien Loong said nickname \u2018entered psyche of every Singaporean\u2019\n\nOver the years, Singaporeans started to use the term \u201clittle red dot\u201d to symbolise the small nation\u2019s achievements despite having few resources and a population that pales in comparison to its neighbours.\n\nIn 2003, then-deputy prime minister Lee Hsien Loong said Habibie\u2019s \u201cred dot\u201d comment \u201cwas a vivid and valuable reminder that we are indeed very small and very vulnerable\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe little red dot has entered the psyche of every Singaporean, and become a permanent part of our vocabulary, for which we are grateful,\u201d he added.\n\nHabibie: Term meant to highlight Singapore\u2019s achievements\n\nEight years after he first coined the nickname for Singapore, Habibie himself addressed the topic once more.\n\nHabibie, when he was still Indonesia\u2019s state minister for research and technology, with Singapore\u2019s then-deputy prime minister and defence minister Tony Tan. Lianhe Zaobao\n\nIn a report carried by The Straits Times on September 20, 2006, the former president said he had no intention of dismissing the Lion City when he made those remarks.\n\nInstead, he wanted to highlight Singapore\u2019s achievements despite its small size, The Straits Times quoted him as saying.\n\nAccording to Habibie, the remark came about while he was speaking off-the-cuff with members of an Indonesian youth group. He told reporters then that his comments to the youth group were: \u201cIf you look at the map of South-east Asia, you (Indonesia) are so big, and Singapore is just a dot. But if you come to Singapore, you see people with vision.\u201d\n\nHe added that he knew the comments did not go down well with Singaporeans, saying: \u201cBut of course at that time people didn\u2019t like me\u2026and I have corrected many times, but they have never put it.\u201d\n\nHe added that he \u201ccould not prove it in writing because I was talking freely\u201d.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - \"You see, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
