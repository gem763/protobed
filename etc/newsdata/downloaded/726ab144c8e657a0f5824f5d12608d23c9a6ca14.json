The shake-up spurred wide criticism at the time.\n\nHall described the ordeal as a demotion in an interview with The New York Times last week.\n\nIn October 2018, NBC canceled \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d as Kelly faced swift backlash over her on-air defense of the use of blackface in Halloween costumes. Many went on social media after that happened to reignite calls for Hall\u2019s return to the 9 a.m. slot.\n\nSince her departure from NBC, Hall, 48, married Steven Greener, and the two welcomed the birth of their baby boy, Moses, earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d have to lose everything to gain even more, but I lost my spot and I gained a husband who roots for me,\u201d Hall told People in a May interview.\n\n\u201cA beautiful baby boy who looks at me like I\u2019m his entire world and not just his milk source, and I have a phenomenal daytime talk show team who every time we\u2019re on the phone, they just want the best for me and I want the best for them,\u201d she added.\n\nHall told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Wednesday that \u201cTamron Hall\u201d will aim to provide \u201ca safe and open environment\u201d for its guests.", "description": "\"I feel it\u2019s a reminder to everyone to not give up on your dreams,\" the veteran journalist said two years after her exit from the \"Today\" show.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d713cb82500007a12051416.jpeg?cache=gymeqor4r6&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
