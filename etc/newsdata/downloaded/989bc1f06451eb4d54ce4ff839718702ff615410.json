The wave of violence has prompted outrage in the country\u2019s Arab communities, near-daily protests and accusations that law enforcement protects some Israelis more than others. On Tuesday another man was shot dead after right after an anti-violence protest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIsrael\u2019s Arab minority, 20 percent of the country\u2019s population of about 9 million, accounts for more than half of deaths from violent crime. Arab citizens say they are under siege in areas awash with illegal weapons, nightly gunfire, organized crime and revenge killings. They complain the violence is allowed to fester even when neighbors try to enlist police help. In this city of 57,000, only two of last year\u2019s 11 murders were solved, according to Mayor Samir Mahamid.\n\nIsraeli Arabs say such a crime wave would never be tolerated in the country\u2019s Jewish neighborhoods, where fatalities are rare and police are praised for high-tech crime-fighting. Ibrahim\u2019s brother Yosef, who raced to his side, said it took more than 20 minutes f\n\nor police to arrive and even longer for the ambulance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey could have helped him, but he died before they came,\u201d Yosef said, sipping coffee with his father and uncles in front of their house. \u201cIf you call emergency in Tel Aviv, they are there in two minutes.\u201d Police could not provide information on the response time after Ibrahim\u2019s shooting.\n\nAD\n\nIsraeli Arab politicians are sprinting to keep up with the popular outcry that has thousands of citizens, many of them schoolchildren and families, protesting in cities throughout the country. In most cases, Israeli police have stood by as throngs blocked traffic and carried signs in Hebrew and English reading \u201cEnough is Enough\u201d and \u201cWe want peace.\u201d\n\nMany said their Jewish neighbors have been understanding, even when they are inconvenienced.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe feel sympathy, and that\u2019s been different this time,\u201d said Yousef Jabareen, a member of the Israeli parliament from Umm al-Fahm who handed out water to drivers blocked by the protest that followed Ibrahim\u2019s funeral.\n\nJabareen, a former law professor who studied the American civil rights movement at Georgetown University, said the disparity in policing reflects the second-class status of Arabs in heavily segregated Israeli society.\n\nAD\n\nArabs have the right to vote and other privileges of citizenship, but their neighborhoods are typically more crowded and receive less funding for schools and infrastructure, Jabareen said.\n\n\u201cIt is not only that the police have neglected Arab citizens of Israel, it is the government as a whole,\u201d said Ruth Lewin-Chen of the Abraham Initiatives, a nonprofit that promotes equality between Jewish and Arab citizens.\n\nAD\n\nIsraeli officials acknowledge that police have neglected Arab neighborhoods for decades. That has begun to change, the officials say, with the hiring of more police, including Arab recruits, and the opening of seven stations in affected areas, with two more scheduled to open before the end of the year. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently responded to the protests with a promise to spend more on law enforcement in Arab neighborhoods.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have started an operation to deal with the violence, but it\u2019s only been three years to fix what was not dealt with for more than 70 years,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Jamal Hakroosh, head of Arab Israeli policing for Israel\u2019s National Police. He is the first Arab to be appointed to such a high rank in the force.\n\nHakroosh said police have also boosted their efforts to collect illegal weapons and are working with the army to stop the flow of guns from the West Bank. Police plan next month to begin asking people to turn in their weapons, no questions asked.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI hope people will return the guns,\u201d Hakroosh said. \u201cIn the past, similar operations did not work because we did not have support from the community leaders.\u201d\n\nPolice say one of the biggest barriers in Arab communities is a lack of trust and cooperation. Witnesses clam up, crimes go unreported. One police commander told a criminologist at Hebrew University that Arab residents sometimes actively thwart investigators, according to a review of his research in the daily Haaretz. \u201cThey remove the closed-circuit cameras, collect the bullet shells, wash down the scene,\u201d the commander said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is a culture of tribes and the families remain silent, like a brick wall,\u201d said Mordechai Kedar, a researcher of Arab societies at Bar-Ilan University.\n\nAD\n\nThe mistrust is no surprise, Arab leaders say, when most of their constituents view the police as an extension of a government that doesn\u2019t value them.\n\n\u201cPeople see the police as part of the mechanics of discrimination,\u201d said Jabareen.\n\nSome Jewish Israelis view Arab culture as inherently violent. They point to a history of revenge attacks, clan feuds and so-called honor killings.\n\nThis month, Israel\u2019s public security minister, Gilad Erdan, was criticized by Arab leaders when he told a Jerusalem radio station that the violence stemmed in part from \u201ccultural codes.\u201d He said, \u201cArab society, and I say this sadly, is a society that is very, very violent.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nErdan said critics took his comments out of context. In an interview, the minister said he has made tackling violence in the Arab community a priority, citing the boost in Arab officers, new stations and programs to stem the flow of guns. But he said Arab leaders need to do more to make the police more effective in their towns.\n\n\u201cBecause of the national conflict between Jews and Arabs, some in the Arab community believe that cooperating with the police means supporting Israeli sovereignty,\u201d said Erdan. \u201cBut the Arab leadership needs to embrace the police and help them become a positive force in their society.\u201d\n\nA few days after his radio comments, Erdan met with Arab leaders and discussed ways to address the violence, including a plan to target organized crime.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was some progress and it\u2019s important for us to continue the conversation with the police and the minister,\u201d said Ayman Odeh, a parliament member and leader of a coalition of Arab parties. \u201cBut it\u2019s still not enough and we will continue the battle.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn Umm al-Fahm, Mayor Mahamid agreed that Arab citizens must be ready to change. \u201cIt is not just a matter for police,\u201d he said in an interview in city hall a few blocks from where Ibrahim was shot. \u201cWe have to take this issue back to the house, to the parents.\u201d\n\nMahamid said he\u2019s expanding an informal network of community mediators to broker peace between disputing families and wants to recruit 25 more imams and teachers to short-circuit the cycle of shootings.\n\nSuch an effort might have saved Ibrahim.", "description": "Arab citizens are protesting lax law enforcement they say would never be tolerated in Jewish neighborhoods.", "authors": ["Steve Hendrix", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Steve Hendrix Has Written For Foreign", "National", "Local", "Most Other Sections Of The Post.", "Ruth Eglash", "Reporter Covering Israel", "The Palestinian Territories", "Sufian Taha"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4C6khqh03TR9kp6vDjljVYGnbDA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E7IBRLXLUEI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
