Now we are standing together in unity and solidarity for our members,\u201d union Vice President Terry Dittes said in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s still possible that bargainers could return to the table and hammer out an agreement, but union spokesman Brian Rothenberg said at a news conference that it would be unlikely. He said it would be hard to believe that the bargainers could resolve so many issues before 11:59 p.m.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The letter to members and another one to GM were aimed at turning up the pressure on GM negotiators.\n\n\u201cWhile we are fighting for better wages, affordable quality health care, and job security, GM refuses to put hard working Americans ahead of their record profits,\u201d Dittes, the union\u2019s chief bargainer with GM, said in a statement Saturday night.\n\nA strike by 49,200 union workers would bring to a halt GM\u2019s U.S. production, and would likely stop the company from making vehicles in Canada and Mexico as well. That would mean fewer vehicles for consumers to choose from on dealer lots, and it would make it impossible to build specially ordered cars and trucks.\n\nThe strike would be the union\u2019s first since a two-day work stoppage at GM in 2007.\n\nOn Friday, union leaders extended contracts with Ford and Fiat Chrysler indefinitely, but the pact with General Motors was still set to expire Saturday night.\n\nThe union picked GM, which is more profitable than Ford and Fiat Chrysler, as the target company, meaning it\u2019s the focus of bargaining and would be the first company to face a walkout. Picket line schedules already have been posted near the entrance to one local UAW office in Detroit.\n\nTalks between the union and GM were tense from the start, largely because GM plans to close four U.S. factories. The union has promised to fight the closures.\n\nHere are the main areas of disagreement:\n\n\u2014 GM is making big money, $8 billion last year alone, and workers want a bigger slice. The union wants annual pay raises to guard against an economic downturn, but the company wants to pay lump sums tied to earnings. Automakers don\u2019t want higher fixed costs.\n\n\u2014 The union also wants new products for the four factories GM wants to close. The factory plans have irked some workers, although most of those who were laid off will get jobs at other GM factories. GM currently has too much U.S. factory capacity.\n\n\u2014 The companies want to close the labor cost gap with workers at plants run by foreign automakers. GM\u2019s gap is the largest at $13 per hour, followed by Ford at $11 and Fiat Chrysler at $5, according to figures from the Center for Automotive Research. GM pays $63 per hour in wages and benefits compared with $50 at the foreign-owned factories.\n\n\u2014 Union members have great health insurance plans but workers pay about 4% of the cost. Employees of large firms nationwide pay about 34%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The companies would like to cut costs.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The United Auto Workers union announced that its roughly 49,000 members at General Motors plants in the U.S. will go on strike Sunday night.", "authors": ["Tom Krisher"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/general-motors-union-workers-strike.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
