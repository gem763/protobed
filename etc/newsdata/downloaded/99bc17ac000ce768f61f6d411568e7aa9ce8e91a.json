(Mario Tama/Getty Images via Bloomberg)\n\nThe chief executives of 145 U.S. companies pressed Senate leaders to expand background checks to all firearms sales and implement stronger \u201cred flag\u201d laws, marking the latest push by corporate America to pressure Congress to take meaningful action on gun violence.\n\nSignatories to a letter sent Thursday include the heads of major retailers, tech firms, financial institutions, including Levi Strauss, Twitter, Uber, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Yelp, Bain Capital and Reddit. The letter pointed to mass shootings in recent weeks \u2014 including those in El Paso, Dayton and Gilroy, Calif. \u2014 but also called out a broader epidemic of gun violence that kills 100 Americans each day and wounds hundreds more.\n\n[\u2018We\u2019ve got to protect ourselves\u2019: Some threaten to shop elsewhere if they can\u2019t openly carry guns]\n\n\u201cAs leaders of some of America\u2019s most respected companies and those with significant business interests in the United States, we are writing to you because we have a responsibility and obligation to stand up for the safety of our employees, customers and all Americans in the communities we serve across the country,\u201d the executives wrote.\n\n\u201cDoing nothing about America\u2019s gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety,\u201d they continued.\n\nCorporate America has increasingly weighed in on \u2014 or been forced to reckon with \u2014 pressing social and political issues facing the country and the world, from immigration to abortion. On gun reform, companies from retailers to banks have considered whether to overhaul their own policies or distance themselves from the vast firearm industry \u2014 or not. Gun sellers have come under acute pressure to limit the sales of firearms, especially since 24 people were killed at two separate shootings in Walmart stores last month.\n\nA recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that Americans across party and demographic lines overwhelmingly support expanded background checks for gun buyers and allowing law enforcement to temporarily seize weapons from troubled individuals. The poll found that 86 percent of Americans support implementing \u201cred flag\u201d provisions allowing guns to be taken from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others. And 89 percent support expanding federal background checks to cover private sales and gun-show transactions.\n\nSpecifically, Thursday\u2019s letter urged the Senate to pass a bill requiring background checks on all gun sales plus a strong Red Flag law that would allow courts to issue lifesaving extreme risk protection orders. The House has passed gun-control bills, but they have stalled in the Senate.\n\nSince Congress established the background check system 25 years ago, background checks have blocked more than 3.5 million gun sales to prohibited purchasers like convicted felons and domestic abusers, the letter states.\n\nBut in the subsequent decades, the background check law has not been updated to reflect how guns are bought and sold today. The company executives wrote that the Senate should follow actions taken by the House to pass bipartisan legislation to update the background checks law, \u201chelping to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them.\u201d\n\n[Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods overhauled its gun policies after Parkland. The CEO didn\u2019t stop there.]\n\nThe leaders also wrote that expanding Red Flag laws would enable families and law enforcement nationwide to intervene when someone is at serious risk of hurting themselves or others.\n\nWalmart, the largest employer in the country, did not sign Thursday\u2019s letter. But last week, the company wrote a separate letter to Congress urging for a debate over reauthorizing an assault weapons ban. Walmart also announced it would stop selling ammunition for military-style weapons and no longer allow customers to openly carry firearms in stores. Other retailers along changed their open-carry policies, including Kroger, CVS and Walgreens.", "description": "Signatories to a letter sent Thursday include the heads of major retailers, tech firms, financial institutions, including Levi Strauss, Twitter, Uber, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Yelp, Bain Capital and Reddit.", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter", "September At Am", "Rachel Siegel Is A National Business Reporter.
