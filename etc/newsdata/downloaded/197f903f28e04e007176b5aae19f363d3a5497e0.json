Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the two most progressive top-tier candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, defended their ability to defeat President Donald Trump during campaign swings through New Hampshire on Labor Day weekend, offering spirited though somewhat different cases for their general election viability.\n\nWarren had to address the electability question directly, since it came up in a brief question session with voters on Monday following remarks to a crowd of 800 that braved the rain to hear her speak in the backyard of a supporter in the coastal town of Hampton Falls.\n\nLinda Rhodes, a Warren partisan active in the liberal advocacy group Indivisible New Hampshire, asked Warren what to tell people who say they like Warren\u2019s ideas but are not sure she can beat Trump in the general election.\n\nWarren began by promoting her pugnacity.\n\n\u201cI know how to fight and I know how to win,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a big part of it. You have to be willing to get in this fight all the way.\u201d\n\nShe also argued that backing a candidate with ambitious ideas for solving people\u2019s problems, many of which predate Trump, is a surer way to motivate them to show up on Election Day than merely promising to roll back the clock to before Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cBeing willing to confront the big problems in this country and then producing plans, real plans, for big structural change \u2015 that\u2019s what people want in this country,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to give people a reason to show up and vote and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nBrian Snyder / Reuters Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said her history as a \"fighter\" would make her a strong competitor to take on President Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nIn her response, Warren appeared to take a veiled swipe at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has argued that if Trump loses, his presidency will be seen as \u201can aberration,\u201d rather than the product of structural problems plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s not pretending that everything was just fine and then there was this one problem and we get rid of that one problem, it\u2019s all going to work out \u2015 \u2019cause it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. We have problems going back decades now.\u201d\n\nSanders took a more prosaic approach to the topic in three campaign speeches in Raymond and Dover, New Hampshire, and Portland, Maine, on Sunday. The Vermont senator, who has led Trump in polls of a hypothetical matchup since Sanders\u2019 unsuccessful 2016 primary run, made the argument for his general election viability by pointing to polls that show him ahead once again. He is especially fond of citing a late August poll that showed him beating Trump by 14 percentage points. (The same survey, conducted by Quinnipiac University, found that five Democrats would beat Trump, though Biden had the largest margin of victory with a 16-point edge; Warren bested Trump by 12 points.)\n\nSanders summarized the poll results to a crowd of over 375 in Raymond, before setting out the stakes of a potential showdown with Trump, whom he dubbed the \u201cmost dangerous president in the modern history of this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to get rid of that person in the White House. And with your help, that is exactly what we are going to do,\u201d he declared.\n\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, top Sanders surrogates and co-founders of the Vermont-based ice cream brand Ben & Jerry\u2019s, had a similar message in their remarks introducing Sanders. In poll after poll, Cohen said, \u201cBernie beats Trump.\u201d\n\nHe repeated the phrase like a mantra, until the crowd, assembled in chairs in a muggy high school auditorium, repeated it like a chant, \u201cBernie beats Trump/ Bernie beats Trump.\u201d\n\nPreston Ehrler/SOPA Images/Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) often cites his poll numbers in a head-to-head matchup with Donald Trump as evidence of his electability.\n\nAt their core though, Sanders and Warren share a conviction that they are running not just to undo Trump\u2019s policies, but to curb the economic inequality and political corruption that they maintain have gripped the country for at least four decades.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to need your help, the day after we are inaugurated,\u201d Sanders said in Raymond. \u201cWe need your help to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite who have been at war against the working class of this country for the last 45 years.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates\u2019 electability pitches are likely responses to Biden\u2019s standing in the polls. He has led the pack in early primary and caucus states since entering the race in April.\n\nPoll watchers tend to attribute Biden\u2019s lead, at least partly, to his perceived strength as a general election candidate. The former vice president has projected an air of inevitability, training his attention on Trump far more than on his Democratic rivals. And in August, Biden\u2019s wife Jill explicitly pitched her husband\u2019s electability, telling Iowans, \u201cYou may like another candidate better, but you have to look at who is going to win.\u201d\n\nAlthough Warren and Sanders are often cast as the most idealistic in the Democratic presidential primary field, there was some evidence over the holiday weekend that voters are buying the pragmatic case for them at the top of the ticket.\n\nNone of those other candidates can slay the dragon the way Bernie can. Sue Hartman, retired educator\n\nSue Hartman, a retired educator who came to see Sanders in Portland, Maine, stood outside the State Theatre after Sanders spoke to a crowd of almost 2,000 people on Sunday night with a look of awed exhaustion on her face.\n\nAsked why she supported Sanders, Hartman volunteered his strength as a general election contender.\n\n\u201cWho can step up and slay the dragon? None of those other candidates can slay the dragon the way Bernie can,\u201d she said. \u201cThe others don\u2019t have the fire in the belly.\u201d\n\nKevin Webb, a renewable energy professional from Exeter, New Hampshire, who came to see Warren in Hampton Falls, likewise pointed to how she would fare against Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Trump can keep up with her. All he has is a racist label \u2015 and nothing else,\u201d said Webb, referring to Trump\u2019s repeated mockery of Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d because of the Native American heritage she has claimed.\n\nOther voters who came to see the two candidates described enjoying hearing them speak, but expressed more confidence in other candidates\u2019 abilities to defeat Trump.\n\nJohn Leahy, a retired information technology firm manager from Exeter who came with three family members to hear Warren speak on Monday, said after the speech that he was leaning toward Biden. The former vice president\u2019s more moderate profile, Leahy reasoned, makes him \u201cpotentially a very strong candidate against Trump.\u201d\n\nRegina Phillips, a consultant who came to see Sanders speak in Portland with her two sisters, said after his speech that she was \u201cfeeling the Bern.\u201d\n\nBut pressed on her plans for the Maine primary, slated for Super Tuesday on March 3, Phillips said she was still undecided.\n\n\u201cI need to actually see who can beat Donald Trump. That\u2019s the person I can vote for,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s Bernie. He said he\u2019s 14 percent ahead of Trump, but I know Biden\u2019s ahead of Trump too.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWhat\u2019s going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe,\u201d Warren said as she and Sanders promised they can beat President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6dd8952500005500019160.jpeg?cache=53jiworufq&ops=1778_1000"}
