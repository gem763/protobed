Individually, we have players who are world class. Collectively, for several years, that hasn\u2019t been the case.\n\n\u2018Take control guys, because it is your history, your World Cup. You are there for your career and for your country. You are there for French rugby and to try to go as far as possible, to see if you can win this World Cup \u2014 but we will only get there if you take control.\n\nMourad Boudjellal, owner of Top 14 side Toulon, has called on the players to rise up\n\n'Japan is a magnificent country to visit. Our coaches who are there, I invite you to visit Japan, go and look around, treat yourself and leave the players to tell their own stories because for years I have not understood the game plan of this France team.\n\n\u2018Honestly, I don\u2019t understand. Something is going wrong, so it\u2019s over to you guys (players). Tell the coaches to go on holiday. Write your story yourself. There is a lot of experience, there are guys in this group who will certainly be major coaches in the future, so start to be a big coach today. Start today, kick the coaches out, take control. Tell your own story, we are ready to follow you.\u2019\n\nThis is a familiar scenario for the French. Eight years ago, Marc Lievremont\u2019s squad staged a rebellion after losing their last pool game against Tonga.\n\nThe players took control and France went on to reach the 2011 World Cup final \u2014 losing by just a point to host nation New Zealand.", "description": "France's World Cup campaign is lurching towards trademark chaos, with the players being urged to stage a mutiny against their coaches ahead of Saturday's clash with England.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/19/19409028-0-image-a-7_1570473018415.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
