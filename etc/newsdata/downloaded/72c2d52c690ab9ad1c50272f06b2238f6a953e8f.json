According to Martinez, the birthing process took longer than expected, forcing the club to replace Hudson with right-handed pitcher Wander Suero on the team\u2019s postseason roster.\n\n\u201cI told him, I said, \u2018Hey, family\u2019s always first,\u2019\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI mean, I get it, I understand. The timing didn\u2019t work out like we thought, baby wasn\u2019t ready to come out. So we get him back when we get him back.\u201d\n\nVeteran left-hander Sean Doolittle is expected to close if a save situation arises against the Cardinals. Left-hander Roenis Elias was also added to the team\u2019s NLCS roster to give Washington another lefty out of the bullpen.\n\n\u201cWe have enough weapons in that bullpen to hold off,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt\u2019s one game, we\u2019ll figure it out. When the game starts, we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re at and then we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\n\nGame 1 of the best-of-seven series is Friday at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 The Washington Nationals will begin the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals without closer Daniel", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
