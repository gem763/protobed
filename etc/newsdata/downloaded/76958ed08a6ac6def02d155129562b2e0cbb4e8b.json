They said the pipeline giant\u2019s approach to restricting access to the pipeline system during period of maintenance and construction was hurting the industry, cratering local commodity prices and causing corporate bankruptcies by denying producers access to gas storage facilities.\n\nAhead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, 22 Canadian natural gas producers and the Alberta Department of Energy filed letters supporting TC Energy\u2019s application, which asked the CER to approve the application quickly.\n\nAmong those supporting the application are some of the country\u2019s largest gas producers, such as Tourmaline Oil Corp.; Shell Canada Energy; Paramount Resources Ltd.; and BP Plc\u2019s Canadian subsidiary, BP Canada Energy Group ULC.\n\nOne executive, who declined to speak on the record during the hearing, said there is a tidal wave of support for the change within the Canadian gas sector, and companies want it immediately.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian natural gas producing industry is in crisis,\u201d said Colin King, a lawyer acting on behalf of the Alberta Department of Energy. \u201cAlberta fully and strongly supports the application.\u201d\n\nBP even argued in its letter that TC Energy\u2019s application for a temporary change \u2013 which would last until 2021 \u2013 didn\u2019t go far enough. The letter noted, \u201cthat the temporary service protocol principles could, and perhaps should, apply across the NGTL system on a permanent and annual basis.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the issue, four companies \u2013 including U.S. commodity traders Sequent Energy and Freepoint Commodities LLC, Spanish utility Iberdola Canada Energy Services and Canadian Fertilizers Ltd. \u2013 filed letters of opposition, asking the CER to deny the application.\n\n\u201cWe are four business days away from October,\u201d said David Wood, a lawyer with Torys LLP acting on behalf of Stamford, Ct.-based Freepoint Commodities and Houston-based Sequent Energy, adding that it is \u201cneither economically efficient, nor is it fair\u201d to ask companies that have been transacting in the market to make a major changes in such a short period of time.\n\nWood said the change should be delayed until April 2020.\n\n\u2026 potential unintended consequences have not been addressed Terry Hutch, Canadian Fertilizers vice-president, supply chain\n\nTerry Hutch, Canadian Fertilizers vice-president, supply chain, described the change as government intervention because the Alberta government pushed TC Energy to implement the change. He said this intervention \u201cpicks winners and losers\u201d in the market and could bring about potential unintended consequences, which he did not identify.\n\n\u201cThose potential unintended consequences have not been addressed,\u201d Hutch said.\n\nFertilizer companies use natural gas as an input for their own products and contract to ensure a steady supply of gas for their operations.\n\nThe Alberta government and domestic natural gas producers met throughout the summer to devise a plan that would rescue natural gas prices, which have been extremely volatile during periods of maintenance on TC Energy\u2019s Nova system.\n\nThe meetings resulted in TC Energy\u2019s application to change the service priorities, which it first filed on Aug. 26.\n\nThe Alberta benchmark natural gas price, called AECO, averaged just 64 U.S. cents per thousand cubic feet on Tuesday, which 25 per cent of the value of the Henry Hub benchmark natural gas price that averaged US$2.47 per mcf on the same day.\n\nAt various times this year, generally while TC Energy was performing maintenance on its Nova pipelines, AECO gas has traded under 10 cents per mcf.\n\nTC Energy is scheduled to undertake additional maintenance to the system on Oct. 1 as it works to expand and de-bottleneck the Nova system, and producers are concerned that prices will crater once again without urgent action from the CER.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that this application be approved as quickly as possible,\u201d said Evan Dixon, a partner with Burnet, Duckworth and Palmer LLP acting on behalf of Peyto Exploration and Development Corp.\n\nPeyto is among the 22 gas producers that wrote to the CER in advance of the hearing, expressing support for the application to change how TC Energy operates the Nova system.\n\n\u201cWe urge, or request, the CER to approve this as quickly as you can,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Brien, vice-president of marketing at Jupiter Resources Inc., a privately held company that produces 300 million cubic feet of gas per day.\n\nA spokesperson for the CER said the hearing was expected to last one day \u2013 the hearing was still ongoing at press time \u2013 and commissioners have noted the producers\u2019 request for an expedient decision, but would not say when a decision would be made.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "'The Canadian natural gas producing industry is in crisis.
