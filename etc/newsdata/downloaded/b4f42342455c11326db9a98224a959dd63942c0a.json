Reitman directed the original 1984 film and Aykroyd co-wrote and co-starred in it. Reitman\u2019s son, Jason, is directing the new movie.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful story because people seem to continue to be interested in 35 years after we came out with the first one. And I think we\u2019re trying to expand it a little bit. And I think Jason\u2019s movie does that,\u201d Ivan Reitman said Thursday. \u201cThis is a story about a family.\u201d\n\nBoth men were at Universal Studios Hollywood, where they were promoting a \u201cGhostbusters\u201d-themed \u201cHalloween Horror Nights\u201d maze attraction.\n\nThe franchise was last revived in 2016 with a group of four actresses - Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones - taking over as the title characters, a gender reversal from the original.\n\nAykroyd, who is a producer along with Reitman on the new \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d praised the 2016 film but said it was time to hand off the mantle \u201cto a new generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the girls\u2019 movie kept the concept and the ideas alive - and it was really good, they were great in it - it wasn\u2019t like giving it to the new generation, the actual descendants of the original Ghostbusters. So we\u2019re going to link to the DNA old and new there,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The upcoming \"Ghostbuster\" sequel will focus on the descendants of the original ghost-catchers who rushed around New York City in proton packs and jumpsuits.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ryan Pearson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/film_ghostbusters_sequel_04611_c0-325-3668-2463_s1770x1032.jpg?5ca158a7895d1d89045ecea4232e3cc0d0fc5bdd", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
