In attendance was the assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Ian Fleming.\n\nThe trip so inspired Fleming that the \u201cTrain Of Tomorrow\u201d that carried him from New York to his Jamaica-bound aircraft in Florida featured in several James Bond novels: it was the Silver Meteor.\n\nThe route is celebrating its 80th anniversary this year, but there is no doubt that Fleming would still recognise the gunmetal grey leviathan.\n\nLike an endless airstream, today\u2019s Silver Meteor is taller, broader, longer and stronger than any European train. Its double diesels hum in readiness\u2026 to thwack the 1,389 miles (2,235km) down to the Miami sun. The 28-hour route allows for holiday stops in 33 cities across 11 states.\n\nMy wife and I booked with Great Rail Journeys \u2013 but tickets for Bond and escaping siren Solitaire in Live and Let Die were sorted by Felix Leiter: \u201cPennsylvania Station. Track 14. Very luxurious. Car 245. Compartment H. Ticket\u2019ll be on the train.
