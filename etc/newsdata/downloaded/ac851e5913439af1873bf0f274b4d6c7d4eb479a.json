Kupperman last week asked a judge to decide whether he must comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony, or defer to the president\u2019s direction that he not appear.\n\nKupperman\u2019s case is viewed as a proxy for whether Bolton will end up cooperating. Richard Leon, the judge assigned to Kupperman\u2019s case, will set the briefing schedule at a hearing Thursday. Democrats who serve on the three committees leading the inquiry have indicated they are not sure whether Bolton will end up appearing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s unpredictable,\u201d said Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), a senior member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nAt least two witnesses who have already testified before impeachment investigators have named Eisenberg and Ellis.\n\nFiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top Russia aide on the NSC, testified earlier this month that she met with Eisenberg twice at Bolton\u2019s urging after she was unnerved by efforts to involve Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani in official Ukraine matters. Hill also quoted Bolton as calling Giuliani \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u201d according to a source familiar with her closed-door testimony.\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a senior NSC aide focusing on Ukraine, told investigators on Tuesday that he twice reported his concerns about Trump\u2019s posture toward Ukraine, including Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During that conversation, Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, and another focused on a debunked conspiracy theory about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman said in his opening statement, which was obtained by POLITICO.\n\nEllis is a former aide to California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee and a top ally of the president. Ellis was identified last year in reports as someone who facilitated Nunes\u2019 access to intelligence information that the California lawmakers later shared with Trump regarding the president\u2019s associates swept up in U.S. government surveillance.\n\nKyle Cheney, Natasha Bertrand and Daniel Lippman contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c5/e3/2993f91e4fbea0fecf051793cc99/191030-john-boltongty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
