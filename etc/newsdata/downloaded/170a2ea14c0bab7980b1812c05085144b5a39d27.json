I'm taking normal meals with a lot of carbohydrates,\" he said in a question and answer session on his Facebook page.\n\n\"I'm concentrating purely on recovery and I have not given any thought for any other challenge. It's too early to tell (about the Olympics).\n\n\"I've never said that I'll no longer run (a marathon) but I'm going to first recover and then decide which race to run.\"\n\nThe sub-two hour marathon is widely regarded as the biggest achievement in athletics since Briton Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile in 1954 - and was compared by Kipchoge himself to landing on the moon.\n\nKipchoge believes his run, which was organised and funded by the British chemical company INEOS and dubbed the INEOS 1.59 challenge, will encourage the next generation of athletes to push the boundaries in his home country.\n\nThe winning moment sparked jubilant scenes in Kenya as traffic was brought to a halt in Nairobi by hundreds of fans celebrating in front of a giant screen.\n\n\"It means a lot... I received a lot of messages. I saw people celebrating all over the country,\" Kipchoge said.\n\n\"Kenya will not be the same. It will be united and in future Kenya will be a running nation.\" (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "description": "Oct 13 (Reuters) - Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge said he needs time to recover physically and mentally after becoming the first person to run a marathon in under two...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
