REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nRisk appetite soured noticeably after Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are signalling they are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad deal pursued by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cNothing is yet in the bag, and optimism on trade has proved time and again to be misplaced,\u201d said Rob Carnell, Asia-Pacific chief economist at ING.\n\nThe Japanese yen, regarded as a safe haven by virtue of Japan\u2019s status as the world\u2019s biggest creditor, edged up 0.1% to 106.79 per dollar.\n\nThe Chinese yuan, the currency most exposed to trade-war tensions, fell more than 0.3% to 7.1356 per dollar in offshore trade. There was no onshore trading as Monday is the last day of China\u2019s long holiday break for its national day.\n\nOther trade-exposed currencies such as the Australian dollar and the Korean won also fell on doubts that much will be achieved at the trade negotiations.\n\nDeputy-level meetings will be held on Monday and Tuesday, with top-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday, when Chinese Vice Premier Liu He meets U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington.\n\nGlobal markets have been on a roller coaster ride this year as hopes for a deal have waxed and waned, while weak economic data in Europe, the United States and China have added to evidence that the tensions are dragging on global trade and growth.\n\nThe jitters knocked the dollar from a two-year high last week, and it remained subdued on Monday. Against a basket of major currencies it was steady at 98.818 - almost a percentage point below its week-ago peak.\n\nSignals from both sides in the lead-up to the trade talks have been mixed.\n\nTrump last month delayed hiking levies on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15, \u201cas a gesture of good will,\u201d while China has again begun purchasing U.S agricultural goods.\n\nBut administration sources late in September also said the U.S. was considering imposing restrictions on investing in Chinese companies.\n\n\u201cThe odds remain low for a trade deal,\u201d analysts at DBS Bank in Singapore said in an emailed note.\n\n\u201cWashington wants to get the whole deal done but Beijing is unwilling to do so without the U.S. rolling back tariffs.\u201d\n\nAs the dollar has lost momentum, the euro stood at $1.0979, up 0.03% in Asia, recovering little by little after having hit a near 2-1/2-year low of $1.0879 last Tuesday.\n\nSterling was little changed at $1.2325, with uncertainties over Brexit keeping many investors on the sideline.\n\nWith only a few weeks until UK\u2019s scheduled exit from the European Union on Oct. 31, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking significant changes to how the contentious issue of the Irish border is dealt with.\n\nThe European Union and Ireland said last week that his proposals were unlikely to yield a deal.", "description": "The yen gained slightly and the yuan slipped on Monday as investors nervously awaited U.S.-China talks this week for signs of whether the two sides can de-escalate or end their punishing trade war.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437936087&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9600N", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
