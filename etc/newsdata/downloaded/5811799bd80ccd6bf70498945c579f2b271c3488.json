It was the occasion that had so much on the line for the island nation.\n\nBut it coudn't have gone possibly more wrong as they were reduced to 19 for six within four overs, and it seemed they had blown their opportunity to secure automatic qualification. However, led by Norman Vanua\u2019s fighting 48-ball 54, PNG recovered to post 118 in 19.3 overs.\n\nDon't Miss 8.4 K SHARES 13 K SHARES 4.3 K SHARES 4 K SHARES 1.5 K SHARES\n\nThe moment PNG qualified for the #T20WorldCup!\n\nLook how much it means to them! pic.twitter.com/F2PM64vAcn \u2014 T20 World Cup (@T20WorldCup) October 27, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nDefending 119 in a T20 game, Papua New Guinea knew they had a mighty task at hand, but their bowlers came out firing and didn't give anything away.\n\nKenya had Irfan Karim scoring a 22-ball 29, and that meant they were 40 for one after the Powerplay. However, the slide began. There were only two more scores that reached double digits: Collins Obuya made a 19-ball 10, and Aman Gandhi fought to a 25-ball 14.\n\nAssad Vala returned a brilliant 3/7, and Nosaina Pokana provided superb support with his 3/21. Kenya were bundled out for 73 in 18.4 overs.\n\nIt was PNG's fifth win in 6 games, ensuring them of automatic qualification for the tournament in Australia next year.\n\nICC\n\nHistory was made - it was richly deserved for Papua New Guinea, who played out of their skin, put bodies on the line, and showed great team spirit to achieve what looked impossible before the tournament.\n\nIt is a massive boost for a country looking to make their way up the ladders in world cricket. The qualification might be the start PNG needed to make big inroads and shock the established foundations of cricket.\n\nPlaying against the top teams, in a World Cup, is a remarkable achievement, and Papua New Guinea would know its their time to make a big impact on a bigger stage.\n\nThey have arrived, and they mean business.\n\n(With Inputs From PTI)", "description": "It was a day for the history books as Papua New Guinea booked their place in next year's T20 World Cup after beating Kenya.They were massive under dogs coming into the T20 World Cup qualifiers, but their performance on the pitch was reminiscing of an established team that knew no bounds and were determined to not only play, but to win too.", "authors": ["Basit Aijaz"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/t20_world_cup_1572245041_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
