Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., defended House Democrats' decision to conduct their impeachment inquiry behind closed doors Wednesday, saying that they don't want witnesses \"sharing\" information.\n\n\"Why are we doing this part behind closed doors? It's because this is a tight circle of people who saw the president's shakedown scheme,\" Swalwell said on \"The Story with Martha MacCallum\". \"[What] we don't want with this, is sharing with each other what they heard or what they did.\"\n\nRep.
