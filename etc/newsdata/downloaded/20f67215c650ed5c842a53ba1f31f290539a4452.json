of the during the women's singles final \u2013 her first grand slam title AFP/Getty Images\n\nShe has now been the runner-up at four of the seven majors she has entered since returning to the tour after having a baby two years ago.\n\nAndreescu displayed the same sort of big serving and big hitting that Williams usually does. Williams was not at her best, either, getting tight at key moments, including double-faulting on the last point of three games to get broken.\n\nShe went up 5-1 in the second set and served for the victory there, even holding a match point at 40-30. But Williams erased that with a forehand return winner off a 105 mph serve.\n\nThat launched a four-game run for Williams, who broke Andreescu again to make it five-all. The Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd was overwhelmingly supporting Williams, not surprisingly, and spectators got so loud as she tried to put together a successful comeback that Andreescu covered her ears with her hands after one point.\n\nSuddenly, this was a contest.\n\nBut as well as Andreescu handled everything \u2014 herself, her far-more-experienced and successful opponent, and even the moment \u2014 Williams was far from her best, especially while serving. She got broken for the sixth time in the final game.\n\nAndreescu only has participated in four majors in her brief career.\n\nA year ago, Andreescu was losing in the opening round of qualifying.\n\nOn Saturday, there she was, putting her hands on her head, dropping her racket and then pumping her fists when it ended. After a hug from a smiling Williams at the net, Andreescu kissed the blue court and rolled onto her back, soaking in the applause.", "description": "Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu beats Serena Williams in the US Open final to claim her first Grand Slam title.
