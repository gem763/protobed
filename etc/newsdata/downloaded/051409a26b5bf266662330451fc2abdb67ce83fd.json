Another 40 alien-seekers were ordered to disperse from the entrance near the town of Rachel at 3am on Friday.\n\nLincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee estimated that about 1,500 people in total had gathered at the festival sites, with a few hundred making the arduous drive along dirt roads to the gates of Area 51.\n\nThe gates are marked by bright floodlights, security cameras and, at the Rachel gate, a bunker building with blackout windows \u2013 all surrounded by razor wire.\n\nMany visitors dressed as aliens or practised their \u2018naruto run\u2019 \u2013 a reference to the style of running used in the anime series Naruto, where a person leans forward with both arms stretched out behind them. One man even performed a naruto run in the background of a live TV report from the Area 51 event.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great sense of community among everyone here,\u201d said John Derryberry, who drove with his girlfriend, Sarah Shore, from Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nOfficials confirmed there had been no reports of alien sightings or abductions so far.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Hundreds of people gather at Area 51 to \u2018see them aliens\u2019", "description": "Paul Oakenfold performed for a crowd of just 100 alien hunters at Area 51 after a viral Facebook urging people to converge on the secret base to hunt extra-terrestrials.The world-renowned British DJ said he agreed to play an hour-long set because he was \u201ccurious\u201d about plans to storm the top-security", "authors": ["Peter Stubley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bdiEaYeWjA.zfAgP6ny0og--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/93b6d843c2d61b239140efe0cfc7dbe1", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
