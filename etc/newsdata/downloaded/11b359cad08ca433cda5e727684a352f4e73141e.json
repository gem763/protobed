Life is fucking hard. Pain is demoralizing, and you're not alone. \u2014 sia (@Sia) October 4, 2019\n\nSia is famously private, and even covers her face at most public appearances and in music videos.\n\nBut she opened up about her pain in a tweet dedicated to her fans who were also suffering, be it physically or mentally.\n\nIn a post to her 3.8 million followers, Sia wrote: \"Hey, I'm suffering with chronic pain, a neurological disease, ehlers danlos and I just wanted to say to those of you suffering from pain, whether physical or emotional, I love you, keep going.\n\n(Image: Getty Images North America)\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\n\"Life is fucking hard. Pain is demoralizing, and you're not alone.\"\n\nThe Chandelier singer suffers from other health issues too, including Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder characterised by an overactive thyroid.\n\nShe said in an interview that thyroid hormone replacement therapy had hugely improved her health.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSia has also struggled with addiction to painkillers and alcohol, and has been so depressed in the past that she contemplated suicide.\n\nIn 2010, she cancelled her upcoming public appearances due to extreme lethargy and panic attacks.\n\nLast year she celebrated eight years of being sober with the tweet: \"Eight years sober today. I love you, keep going. You can do it.\"", "description": "Sia has opened up to her fans about her health issues in a heartfelt post about suffering from pain", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Getty Images North America", "Redferns", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466501.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Hammer-Museum-12th-Annual-Gala-In-The-Garden-With-Generous-Support-From-Bottega-Veneta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
