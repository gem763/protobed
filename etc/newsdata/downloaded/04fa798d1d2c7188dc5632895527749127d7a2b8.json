The \"This Is Us\" star is finally getting back to her singing roots.\n\nThe Emmy-nominated actress has released her first new music in 10 years: the self-reflective single \u201cWhen I Wasn\u2019t Watching.\"\n\nThe song is set to appear on Moore\u2019s forthcoming album, due out early next year.\n\n\"The idea of diving back into music after so much time and personal change was really intimidating to me for a while,\" Moore said in a statement. \"But then I finally realized: I'm the only person who can make this move. It all has to start with me.\"\n\nAs for what the song is about, Moore said it\u2019s about the universal experience of \u201cfeeling lost and not quite understanding how you\u2019ve found yourself at a certain point in your life.\"\n\n\"I'm a big believer in the idea that what you've journeyed through is ultimately going to factor into the person you become, and how you'll greet whatever big challenge you face next,\" she added.\n\nMoore began working on her new album, the follow-up to 2009\u2019s \"Amanda Leigh,\" earlier this year, with her husband, musician Taylor Goldsmith, among the collaborators.\n\nShe recorded each song live with a full band and says she aimed to make a \u201cvery California-sounding record \u2013 something that feels sunshiny and airy and natural.\"\n\n\"I very much feel like I'm at the helm of the ship now, where I'm stepping back into music completely on my own terms,\" she said. \"Everything that's happened up until this point has gotten me to where I am today, and I'm so excited to just keep moving forward.\"", "description": "If you were missing her music like candy, good news!
