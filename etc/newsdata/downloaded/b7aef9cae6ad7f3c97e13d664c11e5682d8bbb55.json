I\u2019d then politely request that they lose my phone number.\n\nPerhaps Gallic optimism knows no bounds, which explains why in the spring of 2016, there was a tasting at a Paris bistro called Juveniles, where French Champagne makers faced off against vineyards in a relatively new region about which not much fuss had been made before. As I\u2019m sure you can guess, the underdog prevailed.\n\nBut the winners weren\u2019t from Napa or Sonoma or any well-known wine region but from England.\n\nEngland.\n\nAccording to an article in Drinks Business by Neal Baker, \u201ca bottle of 2011 Gusbourne Ros\u00e9 went up against a NV Ayala Ros\u00e9 Majeur from Champagne, nine preferred the Gusbourne and five picked the Champagne. Half the tasters thought the English wine was Champagne.\u201d\n\nWhile the English certainly know how to drink bubbly, I was shocked that they also know how to make it.\n\nBartholomew Broadbent, the CEO of Broadbent Selections, which imports Gusbourne, put it to me thus: \u201cHistorically, wine would be shipped to the U.K. and then sold from there. As a result, the English developed a history of knowing about all wines.\u201d\n\nLocals in wine regions, meanwhile, know what they make, but not what their neighbors make, he explained. If you were in Burgundy or Bordeaux you could learn about the wines made there, but not wines from other regions. Burgundians didn\u2019t know their Bordeaux, and vice versa. The lack of production in England meant that British oenophiles looked elsewhere for their wines, and learned about everything.\n\n\u201cOf course, the British are also wine adventurers,\u201d Madeleine de Jean, the author of The Night Julius Caesar Invented Champagne, told me. \u201cAs for the shift in the growing regions, that might seem to indicate that France is no longer producing great Champagnes. But that is far from true. And in fact they are shifting into the Aube more and more for space and for really fine Pinot Noir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for the British sparkling wine industry,\u201d she continued, \u201cit was just a matter of time before what was in their blood, since those Celtic tribes and Caesar, returned to the surface. Of course, climate change was needed, too. It had been too cold and damp there.\u201d\n\nMr. Broadbent agrees. The same chalky soil that is found in the Champagne region spreads through Sussex, Kent, and Hampshire, where most of the vineyards for the British sparkling wines are located. \u201cThe biggest reason that England is now making sparkling wines, which are equal, and in many cases better, than Champagne, is because the climate change has given the U.K. a perfect climate,\u201d he says.\n\nTraditionally, Champagne grapes struggle to ripen in the complicated and austere French climate\u2014a steady temperature and rainfall coupled with a tendency to cold and dangerous frost snaps in spring and fall. The region gets about 1,650 hours of annual sunlight, significantly less than Burgundy or Bordeaux, which bathe in around 2,000 hours. I looked up the average sunlight in Essex, which is now 1,600 hours per year. The English countryside also, of course, offers plenty of cold rain and blustery conditions.\n\nMs. de Jean says that she started hearing about the possibility of English sparkling wine in the 1980s. She asked around, but no one she knew had ever tasted any. Although rumors seemed common, she asked around wine shops in London as recently as 2005, and while everyone had heard of vineyards in Kent and Sussex, she couldn\u2019t find any wine on the shelf.\n\n\u201cTwo years later wines from Kent, Sussex, and Essex were the rage,\u201d she remembers.\n\n\u201cNyetimber were the first to plant Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier for the production of traditional method sparkling wines in 1989,\u201d said Laura Rhys, MS, who works for Gusbourne. \u201cTheir first vintage was 1992. Other early pioneers were Camel Valley, Ridgeview and Bolney.\u201d\n\nAt a recent wine tasting in London, there were nearly 50 producers showing sparkling wines.\n\nAndrew Weeber took over the Gusbourne Estate in Kent in 2004 and planted the classic Champagne varietals mentioned above. \u201cWe plant predominantly Burgundian clones,\u201d Ms. Rhys said, \u201cand all the grapes used in our winemaking are sourced solely from Gusbourne vineyards.\u201d\n\nGusbourne produces only single vintage wines. They age on lees for at least 36 months, and spend another three months on cork.\n\nThe result?\n\nAn exceedingly well-balanced glass of sparkling wine, with lots of bread yeast on the nose and notes of green apple skin and lemon oil on the tongue. It finishes crystal clear.\n\n\u201cGusbourne appeals to me because it is more of a serious wine, like Pol Roger or Bollinger,\u201d said Mr. Broadbent. \u201cIt is an excellent food wine.\u201d (It\u2019s interesting that he likens his brand to Pol Roger given that it was a favorite of Winston Churchill. Pol Roger even honored the former prime minister with its Churchill Cuv\u00e9e, which is still available today.)\n\n\u201cThe English have never really embraced English wine because it was nothing to be proud of,\u201d said Mr. Broadbent, an Englishman who lives in America. \u201cThough the English have a love of French wine, they have a love/hate relationship with the French. English sparkling wine is an excuse to say \u2018in your face, France, we are better than you.\u2019\u201d\n\nClimate change news is not good news and looking for positive angles is irresponsible, at best, but in the world of wine, there is a silver lining, and while it makes me feel like the Marquis de Sade, I\u2019m here to suggest that we bring along some Champagne flutes to the cocktail party at the end of the world.", "description": "English sparkling wines beat French Champagne in a blind tasting and are getting better and better.", "authors": ["Max Watman"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568737646/190917-HF-Gusbourne-tease2_es5qm6", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
