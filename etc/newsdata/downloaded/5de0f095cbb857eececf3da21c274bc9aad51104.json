I talked to my colleague Maggie Haberman about why he said something so stunning.\n\nMaggie, whoa. That happened in front of reporters at the White House.\n\nThe briefing was jaw-dropping by any metric. He admitted to a quid pro quo. But it showed once again something you and I talked about two weeks ago: Mr. Trump tries to shift the window on conduct by revealing stuff publicly to take the sting out of its discovery. Mr. Mulvaney insisted the terminology doesn\u2019t matter, but he bluntly acknowledged that aid was withheld from Ukraine to get a desired outcome on an investigation. That is at the heart of what Democrats have been trying to ascertain.\n\nWas it actually the plan for him to do this?\n\nI do think it was, yes \u2014 at least in part. Remember, this happened as Mr. Sondland was on the Hill giving a closed-door deposition . So I think Mr. Mulvaney was trying to rob House Democrats of a headline and frame the events on his own, to take the air out of the sails by saying it out loud. But it\u2019s not clear that he was actually supposed to say there was a quid pro quo. It\u2019s breathtaking that he\u2019s the first person they\u2019ve sent out to expressly discuss these issues and that he said so much.\n\nHow might this affect the impeachment investigation?\n\nHe came out and admitted to a lot of what House Democrats were hoping to get from him in a deposition! I can\u2019t imagine the White House counsel and others were thrilled. Mr. Mulvaney and the counsel\u2019s office have been at odds lately.", "description": "A remarkable news conference seemed to confirm a central premise of the House\u2019s investigation.", "authors": ["Noah Weiland"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/us/politics/17dc-mulvaney/17dc-mulvaney-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
