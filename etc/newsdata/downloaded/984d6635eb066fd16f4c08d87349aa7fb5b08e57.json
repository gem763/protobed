Like incels, they inhibit online spaces where they recount their experiences struggling to form romantic relationships and search for camaraderie.\n\nBut they\u2019re keen to stress the differences between the two communities.\n\nRecently, Metro.co.uk uncovered reasons why the incel community is so appealing to its followers despite obvious problems with masochism and racism as well as talking exploring why some men are trying to wean themselves off it.\n\nSince then, some men have contacted us to explain how Forever Alone (FA) communities are completely different and people should not conflate the two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul*, (aged 35+) emailed Metro.co.uk to tells us he\u2019s a Forever Aloner who just craves human companionship. Sex isn\u2019t his main focus \u2013 even when he paid for it, he ended up \u2018crying and cuddling\u2019 the woman.\n\nHe says sex is the focus for incels, who are so condemned on FA forums that they\u2019re banned.\n\nHe explains: \u2018Forever Aloners tend to be in a similar situation as incels but without any of the adolescent/toxic nonsense that incels spout (Chad, Stacy, etc) nor the hatred and hostility.\n\n\u2018There is a tension between the incels and FAs because incels are banned from Forever Alone discussion boards.\n\n\u2018Forever Aloners tend to be people who have failed at dating \u2013 adult virgins, those with Asperger\u2019s, the mentally ill, etc. We don\u2019t \u201cblame\u201d women, nor are we fixated on sex (no more than anyone else is).\u2019\n\nIncels occupy notoriously misogynist spaces online (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nPeople end up as Forever Alone for a variety of reasons but the commonality is a lack of connection with other people.\n\nThere are different levels of being FA \u2013 many have no one at all in their life (no friends, family, or love interest), others have regular friendship networks but have never had a romantic relationship.\n\nPaul, who works at a university and earns a good income, is indifferent to sex but craves human companionship.\n\nHe adds: \u2018I have dated for only a few months or so in my 35+ years and that was all 16 years ago. I am profoundly introverted, and simply can\u2019t talk to women that way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The dating world is not anywhere nearly as forgiving for men with lifelong mental illnesses as it is for women.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a bad person. I\u2019m not some sort of basement dweller. I\u2019m caring and kind by disposition. I shower and groom daily, I\u2019m polite and pleasant. I\u2019m the quintessential nice guy.\u2019\n\nPaul highlights the thing that sets him, as well as other FA members, apart from incels: responsibility.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have any hatred whatsoever for women,\u2019 he says. \u2018The problems I have are all due to my own failings.\u2019\n\nHe reveals that he has poor mental health and reliance on alcohol, which he knows only he can get help for. He isn\u2019t looking for the \u2018perfect woman\u2019 to offer emotional labour. He wants to get better for himself.\n\nHow can people on Forever Alone forums help themselves? Dr Shaun Davis, a professor at the University of Nottingham and co-author of Positive Mental Health, tells Metro.co.uk some ways FA followers can help better themselves. \u2018Train to become more positive \u2013 it\u2019s easy to lose balance because you can have a month of great days and one bad day can throw it all off-kilter. \u2018Keep perspective. Get objectivity by stepping outside of yourself. \u2018Personally, I\u2019ll make notes on something, stand back from myself and self-reflect. \u2018If I need to get some headspace, I get the dogs and go for a walk in the woods to process issues/challenges and approach. But I need to get away from the thing affecting me. \u2018There\u2019s no one size fits all solution, you have to understand what\u2019s caused the problem.\u2019 Some of his recommendations include actively trying to immerse yourself in social situations such as community events, the gym, and generally expanding social interactions. Connect with people with similar interests, a book club, a mindfulness activity, things that interest you. If you have social anxiety, speak to GP, get support, and explore medication if you can.\n\nFrom chatting to FAs, one thing seems clear \u2013 they take ownership of their shortcomings, unlike incels who often accuse women of racism and misogyny, and blame their rejection on an ethnic hierarchy of \u2018Tyrones\u2019, \u2018ricecels\u2019 and \u2018currycels\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother male FA user, Bob, tells us he\u2019s been FA for most of his life since being homeschooled in the fourth grade.\n\nSimilarly to Paul, Bob blames himself for not having anyone in his life.\n\n\u2018I have nobody to text; nobody to hang out with on the weekends,\u2019 he explains. \u2018My parents support and encourage me, but at the end of the day, my FA status comes from myself.\n\n\u2018I believe the incel community place the blame on others rather than themselves. They refuse to take responsibility for their lives.\n\n\u2018It took me years to realise the only thing that can change our status is for us to take responsibility and do something. I have failed to take responsibility for my situation, which, I believe, is why I\u2019m still FA.\u2019\n\nBob adds that the incel community consists of people who primarily blame their status on women.\n\nIn comparison, he says, \u2018the FA community has more open-minded individuals who give encouragement and important advice.\u2019\n\nLike other FAs, Bob goes through mental fluctuations where he feels content and other times where he\u2019s disconnected from the world.\n\nTo alleviate some of that loneliness, he goes on these forums, which he feels can be a positive avenue of escape. He\u2019s also starting to see the positives of being free of a romantic relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe tells us: \u2018With no friends, there is so much time to learn whatever I want to do without interruption.\u2019\n\nBut a 19-year-old user on a Reddit FA group expresses the opposite sentiment.\n\nHe tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018I joined FA simply because it was what comforted my worries. But it\u2019s kind of funny because the FA sub created most of my worries.\n\n\u2018When I discovered the sub I realized my wishful thinking of \u201cthe right person will come along one day\u201d was wrong, and that by sitting around, nothing was going to happen\n\n\u2018But joining hasn\u2019t helped. It\u2019s done me more harm than good.\u2019\n\nDr Davis, a professor at the University of Nottingham, thinks these spaces reinforce negative behaviours and encourages followers to leave them altogether.\n\n\u2018These sites help perpetuate these behaviours by continuing a negative spiral when followers label themselves \u201cforever alone\u201d,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018There is a mental toll for reinforcing negative behaviour, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby they talk themselves into being forever alone.\n\n\u2018These users need to ask why they\u2019re on FA sites \u2013 Is it an alternative to reaching out, for attention to show others their struggle? Because they genuinely don\u2019t know what to do about it?\u2019.\n\nHe recommends identifying what\u2019s at the heart of isolation, such as poor self-esteem or badly regulated mental health.\n\nGetting a change of environment might help \u2013 which means logging out and leaving the computer.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nMORE: Why do so many men think feminism is a cancer?\n\nMORE: In the midst of racism and violence, why is the incel community still so appealing?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Incels blame women for being lonely.
