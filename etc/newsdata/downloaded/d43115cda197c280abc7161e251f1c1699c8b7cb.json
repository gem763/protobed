As usual, we're keeping high quality as our top priority.\"\n\nThe company didn't provide more details on the \"non-standard condition\" that was holding up production. But the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said the company told dealers last week it was stopping production to test its charging mechanism.\n\nThe motorcycle maker began previewing the LiveWire Electric Motorcycle last year in the U.S. and Europe, to try to rejuvenate lagging sales. The electric motorcycle was a step into a new territory for Harley-Davidson, which had previously been mostly known for louder motorcycles nicknamed \"hogs.\"\n\nThe Milwaukee-based manufacturer has struggled in recent years. Sales of the company's signature motorcycles continued to slide during its second quarter as profit eroded nearly 20%. Harley-Davidson told investors in July it expects less sales revenue in 2019 than originally foretasted, and expects to ship about 212,000 to 217,000 bikes in 2019, down 5,000 from its April estimate of 217,000 to 222,000 bikes.", "description": "Harley-Davidson has halted production and deliveries of its new LiveWire electric motorcycle after reportedly discovering a problem with its charging mechanism.", "authors": ["Mallika Mitra", "Michael Wayland", "Riya Bhattacharjee"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105565304-154177722297218_livewire_17.jpg?v=1541777269", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
