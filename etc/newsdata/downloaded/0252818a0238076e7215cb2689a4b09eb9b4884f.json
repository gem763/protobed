Yang and Fineman field a bunch of questions from fans, including which characters from the show\u2019s past they wish they could play (we would love to see a Mango reboot fronted by Yang, for the record), their favorite sketches (lots of love for Natalie Portman\u2019s rap), plus some excellent advice Yang got from supervising writer Anna Drezen: \u201cStop wringing your hands about writing. Just do it. Stop planning. Just go out there, do it. If it sucks, it\u2019s gonna suck. It\u2019s gonna suck no matter what. Just do it.\u201d Most importantly, Yang and Fineman reveal their zodiac signs \u2014 Fineman is a \u201cweeping Cancer,\u201d and Yang is a \u201cdripping Scorpio.\u201d And in case that didn\u2019t make it clear who this video is for, Yang says it explicitly: \u201cIf you\u2019re a Cancer, a Pisces, or a Scorpio \u2014 if you\u2019re a water sign, please reach out. If you\u2019re any of the other ones, do not come near us. Go away!\u201d\n\nRelated", "description": "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d released a video today featuring new cast members Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman, who field a bunch of questions from fans.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-bowen-chloe.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
