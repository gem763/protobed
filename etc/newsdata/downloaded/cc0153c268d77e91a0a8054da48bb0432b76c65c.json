Posted by Laura Snyder on Wednesday, September 4, 2019\n\nIt was \u201ccollege colors\u201d day at an elementary school in Altamonte Springs, Fla., last week, and one of Laura Snyder\u2019s fourth-grade students wore an orange T-shirt representing his favorite school, the University of Tennessee.\n\n\u201cHe was SO EXCITED to show me his shirt. I was impressed that he took it one step further to make his own label,\u201d Snyder wrote on Facebook, explaining that he drew his own UT logo with pen and paper and attached it to his shirt.\n\nBut after lunch, the student came back to her room crying.\n\n\u201cSome girls at the lunch table next to his (who didn\u2019t even participate in college colors day) had made fun of his sign that he had attached to his shirt. He was DEVASTATED,\u201d Snyder wrote. \u201cI know kids can be cruel, I am aware that it\u2019s not the fanciest sign, BUT this kid used the resources he had available to him to participate in a spirit day.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to cheer him up, Snyder wrote that she planned to buy him a University of Tennessee shirt. She asked Facebook if anyone out there had any contacts at the university \u201cto make it a little extra special for him.\u201d\n\nWhat happened next completely floored her. Her post went viral on Facebook, eventually reaching University of Tennessee fans and then the university itself. The university responded by sending the student a package of UT swag for him and his classmates.\n\nI was touched to learn of a young Florida school student\u2019s heart for the University of Tennessee, and I LOVED his imagination behind designing his own shirt. So many of us admire his love for UT and it\u2019s awesome to see everyone step up to send him some UT gear!#EverywhereUT pic.twitter.com/83YqjzBxag \u2014 UT Interim President Randy Boyd (@UT_President) September 5, 2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure I can put into words his reaction. It was so heartwarming,\u201d Snyder wrote in an update to her post. \u201cMy student was so amazed at all the goodies in the box. He proudly put on the jersey and one of the many hats in the box. All who saw had either goosebumps or tears.\u201d\n\nBut then things got even better.\n\nThe university\u2019s official shop announced Friday that it decided to take the student\u2019s handmade logo and turn it into an actual shirt. And some of the proceeds will be donated to an anti-bullying organization.\n\nYou asked for it, and @UTVolShop made it happen. \ud83c\udf4a\ud83d\udc4a https://t.co/nBGYmyooC1 \u2014 UT Knoxville (@UTKnoxville) September 6, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen I told him that his design was being made into a real shirt and people wanted to wear it, his jaw dropped,\u201d Snyder wrote. \u201cHe had a big smile on his face, walked taller, and I could tell his confidence grew today! Thank you to the UT Nation for that!!\u201d\n\nThe student\u2019s mother wrote a letter of gratitude that Snyder posted. It said, in part, \u201cI can tell you that I spent a lot of my day reading all the kind words in support of my son and I\u2019m touched beyond words,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThis is a letter from my student\u2019s mom Posted by Laura Snyder on Friday, September 6, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nTrapped at a waterfall, this man sent out an SOS message in a bottle.
