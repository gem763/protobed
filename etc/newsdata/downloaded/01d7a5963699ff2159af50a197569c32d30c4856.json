The events that followed her shooting have unfolded in ways that are both typical and unique, leaving her family and activists to balance hope with caution.\n\nThe officer who shot her, Aaron Dean, was taken into custody two days after the killing. Jefferson's family had been calling for an arrest.\n\n\"We would want them to move as swiftly as they move when it's a black person who is accused of a crime,\" said attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented several black families whose loved ones were killed by police officers in recent years. \"It should not be any different if you have a gun or badge.\"\n\nJefferson, 28, was killed in the early hours after a neighbor saw the front door at Jefferson's house had been left open and called police. Jefferson had stayed up late playing a video game with her 8-year-old nephew, who saw her get shot.\n\nShe was shot through a back window by Dean, who was outside the home. Dean was not heard identifying himself as police on the bodycam video, and Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus has said there was no sign Dean or the other officer who responded even knocked on the front door.\n\nDean resigned before being charged with murder Monday.\n\nThe killing immediately sparked outrage and peaceful protests in Jefferson's Texas community, which was still reeling from last year's shooting death of 26-year-old Botham Jean, a black accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia who was killed in his apartment by a white Dallas police officer who was his neighbor. The officer, Amber Guyger, was fired soon after the shooting and charged with murder.\n\nGuyger, who said she mistook Jean's apartment for her own, was convicted earlier this month \u2014 a rare jury decision \u2014 and sentenced to 10 years in prison, a punishment seen by some as too lenient for the crime.\n\nOn Monday, Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price, who is white, penned a letter to the city expressing sadness and regret for Jefferson's death, an unusual move for a public official in such cases.\n\n\"On behalf of the entire city of Fort Worth \u2014 I am sorry,\" the letter reads. \"To Atatiana's family \u2014 I am sorry. There is nothing to justify or explain what happened on Saturday morning. Nothing.\"\n\nPrice's letter also addressed James Smith, the concerned neighbor who called police, and Jefferson's nephew, who she asked the city to surround with prayers and support.\n\nBut even as the mayor and police chief were calling the shooting of Jefferson, a college graduate who was considering medical school, inexcusable, the inclusion of photos of a handgun found inside her home with the bodycam footage was seized upon by some as an effort to discredit her. Similarly, some reacted negatively to an arrest warrant that quoted Jefferson's nephew as saying his aunt pulled out a gun after hearing suspicious noises behind her house.\n\nPrice in her letter denounced the Police Department's initial mention of Jefferson's licensed handgun as \"irrelevant.\"\n\nJean was unarmed but authorities pointed out that he had marijuana in his apartment, which activists called an attempt to smear him. And after Brown was killed by white Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, police said the unarmed, black 18-year-old was suspected of stealing cigarillos from a convenience store before the shooting and they released surveillance video of Brown, which upset protesters.\n\nThere have been encouraging signs of transparency in the handling of Jefferson's killing, with police releasing the bodycam footage and Dean's name to the public on Monday, said Villanova sociologist Jill McCorkel, author of \"Breaking Women: Gender, Race and the New Politics of Imprisonment.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Errin Haines", "Corey Williams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/grUciU0fQMtDjcb3W77OzA--~B/aD0xMzA3O3c9MTg4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/84a74a8e1493b2ba7de7681fa326661a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
