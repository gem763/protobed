REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\n(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Monday it bought New York-based CTRL-labs, a start-up that is exploring ways for people to communicate with computers using brain signals, in a deal that CNBC said was valued at $1 billion.\n\nFacebook Vice President of AR/VR Andrew Bosworth announced the deal in a Facebook post.\n\nCTRL-labs will join Facebook Reality Labs team, Bosworth said, without giving any financial details.\n\nFacebook said it intends to use the neural interface technology of CTRL-labs in developing a wristband that connects to other devices intuitively.\n\n\u201cThe vision for this work is a wristband that lets people control their devices as a natural extension of movement,\u201d Bosworth said.\n\n\u201cWe hope to build this kind of technology, at scale, and get it into consumer products faster,\u201d he added.\n\nMedia reports said CTRL-labs is working with brain science and machine learning to create interfaces for people to control and manipulate computers by thinking. Its development-stage wrist-worn device uses sensors to track gestures and would act as an input device.\n\nThe deal is valued at about $1 billion, CNBC reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. cnb.cx/2mbg1bk\n\nFacebook was not immediately available for comment on the deal value.", "description": "Facebook Inc said on Monday it bought New York-based CTRL-labs, a start-up that is exploring ways for people to communicate with computers using brain signals, in a deal that CNBC said was valued at $1 billion.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433137592&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N00I", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
