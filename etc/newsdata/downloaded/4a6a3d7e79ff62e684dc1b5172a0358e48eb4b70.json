But those who hate, hate with conviction, and conviction is a force multiplier,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we need a politics of love because the politics of fear and injustice and mercilessness has us by THE THROAT.\u201d\n\nThe predominantly black crowd at the 1,500-seat Hillside International Truth Center in Atlanta broke into sustained applause. Later, they packed the hallways lining up to have copies of Williamson\u2019s books signed. It looked like a wildly successful political/spiritual campaign in high gear.\n\nBut when 10 presidential candidates shared the stage this week in Houston for the third Democratic debate, Williamson was in Beverly Hills, hosting her own debate-watching event.\n\nIt was a disappointing result for the bestselling author who garnered attention during the second debate in August. Her description of institutionalized racism as \u201cpart of the dark underbelly of American society\u201d resonated widely; she was the most Googled candidate following the debate, and her performance spawned a miniwave of think pieces pondering whether she should be taken seriously.\n\nBut that bump in attention failed to translate into measurable support. Williamson met the donation threshold to qualify for the third debate but fell well short of the polling threshold .\n\n\u201cSome of it is my own failure,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cI have not had the money or the expertise with which to fully maximize the energy that we generated. But how I did in those polls is not the ultimate determiner of whether this campaign has value, meaning or purpose.\u201d\n\nAs the televised primary machine rolls on without her, Williamson has kept barnstorming the country and trying to get back in the race. During a three-day campaign swing through South Carolina and Atlanta over Labor Day weekend, Williamson, 67, maintained a punishing schedule of appearances and speeches, seeking to build momentum and hopefully make the fourth scheduled debate in October in Ohio.\n\nWilliamson acknowledged that she has considered dropping out. Perhaps most frustrating for someone who has been a nationally known author and spiritual adviser for decades is the realization that she is not being taken seriously enough.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy the daily humiliation. It\u2019s not fun to be derided, to be dismissed,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people say it\u2019s an ego trip, I laugh because what could be more ego-destroying than THIS?\u201d\n\nShe speaks vaguely of a coordinated effort to discredit her that kicked in immediately after her second debate performance. Media reports and interviewers dug up what she called \u201csloppy\u201d old statements and tweets to paint her as an anti-vaccine radical.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been hard to take - this image of me as some crazy lady,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, and in contrast to her public perception among some, Williamson comes across as more angry and fed up with the state of the country than blissed out on the power of love. She still drops phrases like \u201cvortex of moral certitude\u201d into her comments but also speaks of an \u201camoral economic system\u201d that has nearly destroyed the middle class and \u201chijacked America\u2019s moral values.\u201d\n\nWilliamson wears her spirituality on her sleeve, and some of her most enthusiastic crowds have come in houses of worship. On her Labor Day campaign swing, she addressed a packed house of about 250 people at a predominantly white church in Greenville, South Carolina. Two days later she received a rapturous welcome at the Hillside Center. But even among her supporters, her status as an extreme longshot hangs over the proceedings.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s a wonderful person, and I think it\u2019s a shame that somebody like her could never be elected president,\u201d said Autumn Baskin, a 45-year-old graphic designer, as she left Williamson\u2019s appearance at the Hillside church. \u201cI would vote for her if I thought she had a chance.\u201d\n\nWilliamson rarely speaks President Donald Trump\u2019s name; she doesn\u2019t avoid it, but she describes him as a mere symptom of a larger societal sickness that\u2019s been building for decades.\n\n\u201cHe is an opportunistic infection. If all we do is defeat him, those forces will be back in \u201822 and \u201824,\u201d she said.\n\nAs with the second debate, Williamson speaks vividly about the tortured history of racism in America, calling it the country\u2019s \u201coriginal character defect.\u201d\n\nShe talks in overtly religious terms of a countrywide need for confession, contrition and atonement. That\u2019s at the heart of one of her signature proposals: that the U.S. government pay massive financial reparations to its black citizens as atonement for centuries of slavery and discrimination.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s bona fides on the reparations issue are unassailable; she first advocated the step in 1997\u2019s \u201cThe Healing of America.\u201d She proposes that $200 billion to $500 billion be granted over a 20-year period to a Reparations Council. That council, composed of 30 to 50 black academic, cultural and business leaders, would then decide how and when to disperse the funds.\n\n\u201cBlack America will decide,\u201d she told a small roundtable of black religious leaders in Atlanta. \u201cWill it go to historically black universities? Will it be black chambers of commerce? Will it be microloans for small businesses? Somebody like me should not be in the room where those decisions get made.\u201d\n\nThe money itself is important, she says, but equally vital is the need for public contrition from white America. That\u2019s something that affirmative action programs, minority scholarships or microloans for black-owned businesses don\u2019t provide.\n\n\u201cThat brings some economic justice, but it carries no moral force,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cFirst of all, it leaves open the question of whose fault it is, whereas reparations carry an inherent mea culpa.\u201d\n\nWilliamson regards the Democratic National Committee and its polling requirements with suspicion, feeling that the DNC openly favors some candidates over others. She was a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016 when his camp voiced the same suspicions about the DNC favoring Hillary Clinton.\n\nAlthough she unsuccessfully ran for Congress as an independent in California in 2014, Williamson said an independent presidential run is out of the question. She regards Jill Stein\u2019s 2016 independent run as one of several factors that led to Trump\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that Donald Trump is president, I think it would be a very unpatriotic thing to do - to risk taking even 10 votes away from a Democrat,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As the televised primary machine rolls on without her, Marianne Williamson has kept barnstorming the country and trying to get back in the race.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ashraf Khalil"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/07/31/Election_2020_Debate_84814.jpg-db101_c0-22-4971-2920_s1770x1032.jpg?d194efed3471a20ce05466ea24652bf9dc4a8365", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
