However withdrawals cannot be made at the moment.\n\nDespite going into administration last Wednesday, Glint made no mention of this on its website when This is Money first checked it yesterday afternoon\n\nThere has been no activity on the company's website or its Twitter feed since Friday, and until late afternoon yesterday there was no reference on its website to being in administration. It has now since updated its website with a disclaimer.\n\nSince FRP Advisory LLP were appointed as joint administrators the company's website continues to encourage people to sign up and deposit money into the app, and users were still receiving debit cards.\n\nMoney deposited with Glint is not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, as it held an electronic money licence from the FCA rather than a full banking licence.\n\nCustomers were told on the FCA website: 'Glint holds funds on behalf of its customers.\n\n'Safeguarding is a key consumer protection measure within the EMRs and Payments Services Regulations. The purpose of safeguarding is to protect customer money if a firm fails in a disorderly way.\n\n'Safeguarding requirements apply to Glint and are a condition of Glint's authorisation that the firm must comply with at all times.'\n\nGlint allowed users to buy gold bullion using cash for cheaper than a broker and spend it using a Mastercard debit card\n\nAccording to the firm's website, Glint 'maintain a secure and segregated full reserve of all user funds at Lloyds bank in London. Your gold really is your gold \u2013 it's physical gold bullion that is legally allocated to you and stored in a vault in Switzerland.\n\n'Your money really is yours. For every pound, dollar and euro held in your Glint account, Lloyds holds an equivalent amount of assets in their reserve.\n\nGlint has now put a disclaimer on its website telling users it has gone into administration\n\n'For every ounce of gold held in your account there is an ounce of physical gold owned by you in the vault in Switzerland. There is no token, fund or bank that sits in between you and ownership of your money.\n\n'Glint users can be 100 per cent confident that their money is safe, at all times.'\n\nGlint would be the second e-money institution in the last four months to go bust, after digital banking app Loot fell into administration at the end of May.\n\nIn that situation, customers were assured their money was safe as it was held by Germany payments provider Wirecard.\n\nThe FCA encourages any Glint customer or client concerned about how they might be affected to contact FRP Advisory at glintpay@frpadvisory.com.", "description": "For five days after it went into administration  the company did not mention the matter on its website.
