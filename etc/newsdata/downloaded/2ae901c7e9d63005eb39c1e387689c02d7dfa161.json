But one self-described costume medic has Toronto cosplayers covered.\n\nWayne Do is known in the Toronto cosplay world as the on-call medic for anyone experiencing glitches with their wardrobes, which is why his cellphone was ringing all day Saturday with emergency requests from panicked Fan Expo goers.\n\n\"I know how terrible it is to break a costume you have put so much time and effort into,\" Do told CBC Toronto. \"It's terrible, it sucks.\"\n\nWith thousands of fans downtown this weekend to celebrate their favourite comic books, movies and video games by dressing up as fictional heroes and villains, Do says he's kept busy fixing countless costume emergencies.\n\nSelf-described costume medic Wayne Do in action at Toronto's cosplay Fan Expo.

(Robert Krbavac/CBC)\n\nAnd after years of practise, he now knows which tools to keep in his backpack, and which ones to keep around his waist for easy access.\n\nAmong the most necessary pieces of equipment are a hot glue gun, super glue, bobby pins, hair spray, duct tape and safety pins \u2014 the latter of which run out the fastest, Do says.\n\nWayne Do carries a kit, backpack, and belt full of tools to help in any costume emergency.
