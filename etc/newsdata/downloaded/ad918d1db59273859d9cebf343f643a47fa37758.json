Today is the entry bar and it is a big bull bar so far.\n\nThe bulls want this to be a climactic bull trend reversal. They hope that the selloff was simply a sell vacuum test of the bottom of the channel.\n\nThe reversal is similar to the August 8 bottom. The bulls are hoping that it continues, like the climactic reversal in the stock market after Christmas 2018. They need several consecutive bull trend bars to convince traders that the rally will last 3 or more weeks.\n\nThe bears know that, and will try to prevent 3 or more bull bars from closing near their highs. They will try to form a lower high around the EMA.\n\nImportance of the August 1 low\n\nThe minimum goal for the bulls is to get at least 1 pip above the August 1 low of 1.1027. That is the breakout point. Bulls who bought there and scaled in lower want to exit their 1st buy there at breakeven. Many will take profits on their lower purchases there.\n\nIn addition, the bears know that bulls will sell there, so they might sell there as well. It is therefore a resistance zone for today and tomorrow.\n\nHow the chart behaves there will be an indication of what to expect over the next few weeks. The more the hesitation, the less rally will be likely.\n\nOvernight Forex trading\n\nThe 5 minute Forex chart continued yesterday\u2019s rally over night. It has been in a 15 pip trading range for the past 4 hours. That is not yet enough selling for day traders to short. They are continuing to buy dips.\n\nThe trading range means that they are now mostly scalping. The bears will initially look to sell below a strong bear reversal bar at the top. Their first trades will only be scalps. Because the selloffs have been less than 15 pips, the odds are against a pullback growing to more than 20 \u2013 30 pips today.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Al Brooks covering: EUR/USD.
