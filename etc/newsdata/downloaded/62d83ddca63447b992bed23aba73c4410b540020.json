More and more Republicans hear from previously Trump-loyal friends that that\u2019s it, they\u2019re through. That opens up emotional space for them to consider rejecting him, too.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s numbers worsening, it will then become harder to maintain the illusion that Trump is somehow immune to normal political rules. By the time the poll numbers for removal inch up to somewhere in the range of 55 to 58 percent, it becomes clear Trump will almost certainly lose in 2020 \u2014 and worse, take the Senate down with him.\n\nNow his support really begins to collapse, particularly among evangelical Christians. A hard core of Trump supporters, perhaps a quarter of the electorate, will stick with him to the bitter end. But he relies on another big chunk who don\u2019t like him yet rely on him for regulatory and judicial protection from the social justice warriors.", "description": "", "authors": ["Megan Mcardle", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Why-The-Senate-Might-Actually-Remove-Trump-From-Office"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
