There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a General Election. Have a General Election, but don\u2019t mix it up with Brexit,\u201d Mr Blair said.\n\nThe globalist-progressive politician, who took Labour in a centrist direction during his 13-year leadership, had told the current party leader last month to reject calls for an election. He had said that \u201csome may fear a Corbyn premiership more\u201d than Brexit and an election would result in a \u201ccomfortable Tory majority\u201d. Other Blairites in the party also pressured Corbyn to reject an election and attempt to force a second referendum, instead.\n\nThe Remainer-dominated Parliament has hamstrung Prime Minister Boris Johnson and is blocking his endeavours to deliver Brexit. Mr Johnson had tried three times to trigger an election to regain a majority in government that would make good on the people\u2019s June 2016 instruction to take the UK out of the EU. On the fourth attempt last night, Labour finally backed the Bill.\n\nRemainers desperate to elect an anti-Brexit government even tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to pass amendments to extend the voting franchise to 16- and 17-year-old children and EU immigrants.\n\nBlair Fears Next Negotiations Will End in No Deal, EU Doesn\u2019t Want UK as \u2018Off-Shore Competitor\u2019 https://t.co/6KFpt7lIjd \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 28, 2019\n\nSpeaking to Channel 4, Mr Blair accused his own party of letting Boris Johnson \u201cout of the box\u201d to run a campaign that would pit a Conservative prime minister determined to deliver Brexit against socialist Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThere is no love lost between Mr Blair and Mr Corbyn, who took the party Blair had moulded into a model of third-way politics to the far-left. Blair has criticised the Labour Party for failing to adequately fight to stop Brexit and blamed Corbyn for making a no-deal exit a possibility.\n\nThe former prime minister maintains that the party\u2019s priority should be to push for a second referendum to undo Brexit. However, he did say earlier in the week that the two votes \u2014 another referendum and a General Election \u2014 could even be held on the same day.\n\nAsked whether he thought the only way to force a second referendum was to have Jeremy Corbyn in government, Mr Blair refused to back his party\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having enough Members of Parliament in Parliament who are committed to doing that,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Blair avoided backing Mr Corbyn a further three times during the interview, and suggested that his own party may not want him to campaign for them.\n\nHumiliated: Overwhelming Majority Back Hard Brexit in Loaded Tony Blair Poll https://t.co/HyyywHgWSi \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 3, 2018\n\nSplits between the Corbynites and Blairites within Labour have been mirrored in divisions between the formerly much-vaunted People\u2019s Vote campaign, which sought to push a second referendum and overturn Brexit.\n\nThe Guardian described the People\u2019s Vote as having \u201cimploded\u201d this week after two of its senior executives were fired, and dozens of staff staged a walkout.
