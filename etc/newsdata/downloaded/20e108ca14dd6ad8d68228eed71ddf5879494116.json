Labour MEP Jude Kirton-Darling said there were \u201cincreasing numbers of national bans\u201d, asking \u201cWhy isn\u2019t UK on this list?\u201d.\n\nLiberal Democrat MEP Irina Von Wiese, a member of the European parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee told The Independent: \u201cThe UK is increasingly out of step with the rest of the EU. Instead of trying to weaken a strong EU response to Turkey\u2019s incursion into northeast Syria and murderous attack on the Kurds, UK ministers should be implementing a ban on arms exports and condemning Turkey\u2019s actions, which risk reviving Isis and rewarding Russia.\u201d\n\nIn an agreed joint statement, EU foreign ministers said: \u201cThe EU recalls the decision taken by some member states to immediately halt arms exports licensing to Turkey.\n\n\u201cMember states commit to strong national positions regarding their arms export policy to Turkey on the basis of the provision of the common position 2008/944/CFSP on arms export control, including the strict application of criteria 4 on regional stability.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It also significantly undermines the progress achieved so far by the Global Coalition to defeat Daesh, stressing that Daesh remains a threat to European security as well as Turkey\u2019s, regional and international security.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
