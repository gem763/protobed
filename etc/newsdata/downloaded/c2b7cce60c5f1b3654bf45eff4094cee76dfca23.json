Bloomberg\n\nWall Street sees the current schedule of issuance covering the Treasury's needs until late next year, when a growing deficit raises the prospect of increased coupon sizes or new issues.\n\nThe Treasury indicated it's still pursuing three prospective issues it's been seeking feedback on this year. In Wednesday's statement the department said it's \"taking a proactive approach to prepare for prospective future financing needs\" by \"exploring a range of possible new products\".\n\nThose include a one-year floating-rate note linked to SOFR, which is intended to replace the Libor benchmark; a rebooted 20-year bond; and a 50-year bond, according to the statement.\n\nA SOFR-linked issue and a 20-year security topped the list of blue-sky ideas the Treasury solicited from its borrowing advisory committee early this year to help expand and diversify the investor base for its expanding pile of debt.\n\nBut dealers were unenthused by the Treasury's proposal for a 50- or 100-year bond when the department revisited the proposal earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Treasury said Wednesday that it expects to maintain the November 10-year TIPS second reopening auction size at $US12 billion, the December 5-year TIPS reopening auction size at $US15 billion and the January 10-year TIPS auction size at $US14 billion. The total expected TIPS issuance size of $US152 billion for calendar year 2019 is consistent with the department's prior guidance, the Treasury said.\n\nThe Treasury's latest quarterly estimates put 2019 total borrowing at $US1.2 trillion, though it plans to issue less debt in the final months of the year than previously anticipated.\n\nThe department expects to raise $US352 billion in net marketable debt from October through December, $US29 billion less than it estimated in July, according to a statement released on Monday in Washington. The revision owed in part to a higher than expected cash balance at the start of the quarter, thanks to the Fed halting its balance sheet run-off sooner than expected.\n\nThe Treasury sees issuance picking up in January through March, to $US389 billion, based on an end-of-March cash balance of $US400 billion.\n\nFed policy makers conclude a two-day meeting in Washington later Wednesday, where they're widely anticipated to cut the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point for the third time in a row.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "A SOFR-linked issue and a 20-year security topped the list of blue-sky ideas the Treasury solicited from its borrowing advisory committee early this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7852%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_408/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/875dda748c10223d0a5f915382bb352331d5543f", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
