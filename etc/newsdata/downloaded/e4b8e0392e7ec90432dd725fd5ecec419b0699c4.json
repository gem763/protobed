But Chelsea had hitherto lacked a stand out victory against a really good side. Now they have one.\n\nAjax had not lost at all since their heartbreaking Champions League defeat by Tottenham at this stadium in May but here they were downed by a Chelsea side that grew in to this contest and scored the most significant goal of Lampard's short reign five minutes from the end.\n\nMichy Batshuayi was the hero for Chelsea in Amsterdam as he came off the bench to strike the winning goal against Ajax\n\nThe Belgian striker (right) was on hand to meet Christian Pulisic's cross as he came off the bench to make the big contribution\n\nThe emotion was splashed across Frank Lampard's face as he celebrated the late strike as his two substitutes combined\n\nThere was bitter disappointment for Ajax as they were knocked off top spot by the Blues in their Champions League group\n\nMATCH FACTS AND PLAYER RATINGS AJAX: Onana 7; Dest 6.5, Veltman 7 (Huntelaar 88mins 6), Blind 6.5, Tagliafico 6; Alvarez 6 (De Jong 88mins 6), Van de Beek 7, Martinez 7; Ziyech 6.5, Tadic 6.5, Promes 6 (Neres 73mins 6). Subs not used: Bruno Varela, Schuurs, Mazraoui, Marin Booked: Tadic, Martinez Manager: Erik ten Hag 6 CHELSEA: Kepa 6.5; Azpilicueta 7, Zouma 8, Tomori 7.5, Alonso 6.5; Hudson-Odoi 5.5 (James 88mins 6), Kovacic 6, Jorginho 6.5; Willian 6.5 (Pulisic 65mins 7.5), Abraham 6.5 (Batshuayi 70mins 7), Mount 7. Subs not used: Caballero, Giroud, Emerson Palmieri, Gilmour Goal: Batshuayi 86 Booked : Morris, Zouma Manager: Frank Lampard 8 MOM: Kurt Zouma REFEREE: Ovidiu Alin Hategan (Romania) 6.5\n\nThe goal was created by one Lampard substitute and scored by another. So a hat tip to the coach for his courage to send on two attacking players, Christian Pulisic and Michy Batshuayi, with 15 minutes to go.\n\nLampard could have sought a creditable draw at that stage. He could have introduced a more defensive player.\n\nBut when Batshuayi crashed a first time shot in off the bar after great work down the left by his American team-mate, Chelsea had a win that will give them great belief that this season may yet yield more than steady progress.\n\nChelsea were impressive and had to be. Ajax may have lost some of last season's team but they have regenerated and sit top of the Dutch league. They began with confidence and wit and looked as though they could harm Chelsea.\n\nBut, helped by super performances from the central defensive partnership of Kurt Zouma and Fikayo Tomori and the energy and drive of young Mason Mount, Chelsea proved themselves more than capable.\n\nBoth halves of the game mirrored each other, Ajax beginning strongly and fading. The home team didn't have the best of luck, either.\n\nA first half 'goal' from Quincy Promes was ruled out for offside after the VAR officials spotted that he was a toe-end the wrong side of the law.\n\nThen, in the second period, Edson Alvarez headed a corner against the far post.\n\nQuincy Promes thought he had scored the opening goal of the night as he raced off to celebrate in front of the home fans\n\nPromes thought he had given Ajax the lead midway through the first half when he beat Cesar Azpilicueta to the ball to score\n\nBut the decision was reviewed by the Video Assistant Referee and multiple replays showed the Ajax attacker was just offside\n\nFans were informed of the decision via the big screens in the Johan Cruyff ArenA as the review was met with audible groans\n\nEqually, though, Ajax were too careless in possession and it always felt as though a good team may punish them. Chelsea eventually showed themselves to belong in that category.\n\nAfterwards Lampard did not attempt to play down the significance of his team's performance or the result. That was as refreshing as his team's football.\n\n'It feels huge, which always scares me as there's still lots to do,' said the Chelsea manager.\n\n'I think we're entitled to be excited about how we play. This is a blueprint.\n\n'This answers questions because the younger players are still babies in terms of Champions League minutes and this was a huge test.\n\n'I don't want to say this is it, they've made it. But we need to realise the things that happened tonight.\n\n'That is the standard for us.'.\n\nEarly in the game, Ajax looked very much the free-flowing, expansive side we have long expected them to be. It looked as though it could be a long night for a Chelsea team that needed to take something from the game if they were not to fall in to a straight shoot out with Valencia for second place in the group.\n\nIt was a difficult start to the night for Chelsea as Ajax, semi-finalists in last season's tournament, starting on the front foot\n\nFrustration was palpable on the Chelsea bench and Frank Lampard's assistant Jody Morris (far right) was shown a yellow card\n\nNicolas Tagliafico played with real purpose in wide areas for the Dutch side as he looked to turn provider for team-mates\n\nAjax manager Erik ten Haag won the domestic double last season and is continuing to eek out the most he can from his side\n\nThere were some early scares for Lampard and his assistant Jody Morris was booked for something he said during an opening half hour that was not always comfortable.\n\nBut, encouraged by some loose play by Ajax, Chelsea grew in to the game. Mount was progressive and brought a low save from Andre Onana while Callum Hudson-Odoi wasted two good chances.\n\nAjax did look to have scored in the 35th minute when Promes prodded in a deflected cross from Hakim Ziyech at the far post. He was offside, though. Just.\n\nThey were close in the second half, too, when Alvarez hit the post after beating Tammy Abraham to a corner.\n\nBut that chance came on the hour and after that Chelsea were the better side. Their defending had given them the platform on which to build as Ajax tired late in the game and Batshuayi could actually have won the game earlier than he did.\n\nWhen Pulisic's shot from distance was deflected in to the air, it came down perfectly for his team-mate to score from 10 yards. Instead, the Belgian shanked his shot high over the bar. It felt as though Chelsea's best chance had come and gone. A draw would have been a fine result but better was to come.\n\n'Five wins in a row is really dangerous as it can make you sloppy and switch off,' said Lampard.\n\n'But six wins is even more dangerous. That's what I'll tell the squad.'\n\nIt was a rather pragmatic note to sound on what still felt like a significant night.\n\nChelsea, following the VAR reprieve, attempted to find a foothold in the match as Willian used his experience to hold his man\n\nLampard brought his side to Holland unbeaten in the last five matches but he looked concerned during the first 45 minutes\n\nMason Mount has been one of the brightest sparks at Chelsea since Lampard took charge and he looked lively in Amsterdam", "description": "IAN LADYMAN AT THE JOHAN CRUYFF ARENA: Frank Lampard produced his most impressive win since taking over at Chelsea as Batshuayi came off the bench to down Ajax in Amsterdam.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/19/20098052-0-image-a-63_1571857046727.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
