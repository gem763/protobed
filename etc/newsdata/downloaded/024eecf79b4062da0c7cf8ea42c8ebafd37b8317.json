So far, Bank of Italy Deputy Governor Fabio Panetta is the only name circulating in private discussions among officials, sources have said.\n\n\"I'm sure that the Italian candidate will be welcomed by my colleagues but we still have to start the process,\" he said.", "description": "Eurogroup head warns new Italy government over 2020 budget", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF870CT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
