Do you think Donald Trump is a racist?\" asked Webb.\n\n\"I don't know Donald Trump. I don't know his heart, but here's what I tell people. As a woman of color, I get asked this question more than I've ever been asked before. I don't know Donald Trump. I know his policies,\" replied Brazile.\n\n\"I want President Trump to be the President of all Americans and not just his base, and not just Republicans, he's my President,\" continued Brazile, adding that she does take issues with some of the things that the President has said. Specifically, Brazile disliked the President's tweet to members of the so-called Squad to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places where they came from.\u201d\n\nWebb conceded, \"You don't know him -- that's a fair answer,\" but Webb asked Brazile to explain why so many of her Democratic colleagues do not feel constrained in the same way.\n\nThen Brazile made a stunning admission, saying \"Do you know that I get in trouble when I don't say that [the President is racist]. People on the Left [say] 'You know that he's a racist'. I don't know what's in his heart, but I'll tell you what I disagree with Donald Trump on -- I disagree with his tone, his tenor because we are all Americans. We are all fighting for the same thing. And I know that the President wants everybody's respect, but to get respect you also have to give respect.\"\n\n\"Should he get some respect too then from many of the Left...He's been under assault for two years from a number of people...If you're under assault constantly you get defensive,\" Webb asked.\n\nTACTICS USED AGAINST KAVANAUGH ROOTED IN CLARENCE THOMAS HEARINGS\n\n\"You get what you give. I don't need to preach because I am a simple Catholic girl, and I believe in grace and forgiveness. I just want this President to be as good as this country,\" answered Brazile.\n\nThe former DNC chairwoman concluded with this, \"I'm sick and tired of people asking me 'Is he a racist?...You know -- what I got to speak for myself. I can't speak for him or what's in his heart.\"\n\nTo see Webb's full remarks on his latest episode of \"Reality Check,\" visit Fox Nation and watch the popular show today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
