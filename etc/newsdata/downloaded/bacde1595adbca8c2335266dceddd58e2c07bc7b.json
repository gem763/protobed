Rivals accused Rivera of trying to avoid being blamed for a fresh election being called.\n\nAs\u00ed ha propuesto Rivera al PP abstenerse junto a Cs en la investidura de S\u00e1nchez, si este asume compromisos sobre Navarra, Catalu\u00f1a y la econom\u00eda espa\u00f1ola https://t.co/zAauVGEMiY pic.twitter.com/VWm1EXVmtw \u2014 Europa Press (@europapress) September 16, 2019\n\n\u201cIf S\u00e1nchez rectifies, there\u2019s still time to get the country going,\u201d Rivera said in Congress on Tuesday, arguing that the Socialist leader had to choose between a deal with Podemos, a new election and what he dubbed a statesman\u2019s \u201csolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u00e1nchez wanted a new election from the beginning,\u201d Popular Party leader Pablo Casado told reporters on Tuesday, saying he hoped citizens will punish that attitude at the ballot box.\n\nPodemos\u2019 Iglesias accused S\u00e1nchez of preferring an agreement on his right, with Rivera, rather than on his left.\n\nOpinion polls predict the Socialists will do better than the 29 percent they picked up in April, while Podemos, Ciudadanos and the far-right Vox will lose ground. The Popular Party is forecast to make gains at the expense of Vox and Ciudadanos.\n\nSPAIN NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez and his rivals blame each other for failure to make progress.", "authors": ["Diego Torres", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167367477-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
