Work and Pensions Committee chairman Frank Field called it a \"very serious case\".\n\n(Image: UK Parliament)\n\nTory MP Derek Thomas said a \"perfectly innocent\" student was left in \"considerable debt\" after suffering the scam and she is now \"in a really difficult place\".\n\nLabour MP Ruth George said one claimant in poverty with several children had been left \u00a3120 a week worse off. She added: \"They have been duped.\n\n\"They have been told they're applying for a loan. They've had someone looking like an official with a DWP badge turn up at their house and take their details from them.\n\n\"These are not people who have knowingly made a claim to Universal Credit.\"", "description": "The number of advance payment fraud referrals has exploded from 42,000 to 85,000 since July after an industrial-scale scam", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "E", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Uk Parliament"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12338252.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Stressed-Mother-and-Her-Baby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
