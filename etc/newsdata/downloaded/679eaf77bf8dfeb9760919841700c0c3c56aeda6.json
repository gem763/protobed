After visiting a friend on holiday in Mexico City back in 2011, the Brit ventured out to the famed gym of esteemed trainer Nacho Beristain in the Granjas Mexico district.\n\nA student of the sport, Dilmaghani was determined to catch a glimpse of the some of Beristain\u2019s world champions. Often finding himself dropping his law books for tales from the greats of yesteryear, such as Jack Johnson and Archie Moore, the super featherweight\u2019s life would change forever while peppering a punchbag in the sticky humidity of the Romanza Gym.\n\nBeristain barked at him, \u201cEnglish\u201d, before making a scarcely-believable offer to share the ring with the most polished pupil of them all: Marquez.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Undeterred by Marquez breaking one\u2019s jaw and knocking out others, Dilmaghani, in his southpaw stance to replicate the Filipino, accepted and thrived over a three-year stay.\n\n\u201cOne day I was watching Marquez on HBO, I was studying him, then the next day I\u2019m sparring him, it was surreal,\u201d Dilmaghani tells The Independent ahead of his fight with Francisco Fonseca on Saturday on Channel 5.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt wasn't just him, there were (fellow world champions) Jhonny Gonzalez and Rey Vargas. It was such a great experience.\n\n\u201cHe was preparing for Pacquiao. I thought I had a fantastic chin because I'd never been down but I knew I could take a punch when Marquez hit me.\u201d\n\nMarquez would lose a tight decision in that third fight, but showed his lethal ability to combine power and timing by laying out Pacquiao in their fourth fight in 2012 to end one of boxing\u2019s greatest rivalries. The former four-weight world champion provided invaluable experience for the half-Iranian southpaw, who pinpoints just what he learned from the future Hall-of-Famer.\n\n\u201cEverything had a method to it, a purpose, he trained properly,\u201d Dilmaghani recalls. \u201cIt was his nature, so professional.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d shake hands, he was friendly, but then when it came to work time, there was no playing around. You either do boxing or you don't, there's no in between.\u201d\n\nNow better off from the excruciating high-altitude runs in the mountains of Toluca and a professional career that has also taken him to Canada, Dilmaghani is settled back in Dorking.\n\nAt 19-1, his dreams of a big domestic clash with Josh Warrington or Kid Galahad, while distant, are creeping closer with his comfort at boxing at both 126 and 130 pounds. The 28-year-old is now flourishing since adopting the \u2018Mexican style\u2019 alongside his defensive instinct, but one aspect of the hundreds of rounds shared with Marquez remains.\n\n\u201cThe most impressive thing was his timing,\u201d Dilmaghani adds. \u201cI knew he was a great fighter, he is how he is, but what I didn't appreciate was his timing and his decisiveness.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn't hit me around the chin, he'd hit me straight on it.\u201d", "description": "Law graduate Alex Dilmaghani continues to apply lessons learned from legendary Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez this weekend in his pursuit of a world title.
