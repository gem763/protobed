With 50% of government web traffic coming from mobile phones, public services should multiply the channels that citizens can choose from to communicate \u2013 whether that's in person, by phone, or even via smart speakers.\n\nBy creating centralised and secure digital IDs for citizens, technology can also make access to public services smoother. This would allow citizens to manage tax returns, healthcare, electoral lists and other administrative tasks with a single logon \u2013 and at the same time remove excuses to postpone them.\n\nUpdate management structures for the digital age\n\nPublic organisations need to modernise their structure. The first way to do that, according to Gartner, is to replace a 'waterfall' project management approach with digital product management (DPM).\n\nDPM means that managers oversee the entire lifecycle of a product or service \u2013 and therefore deliver on all aspects, from developing an offer to revising customer satisfaction. Ultimately, this means faster and more sustainable results.\n\nSEE: Digital transformation: A CXO's guide (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n\nThat's not to say that they shouldn't delegate \u2013 in fact, quite the contrary. According to Gartner, managers should also focus on efficient shared services, ranging from security to business analytics. Additionally, they should invest in Anything as a Service (XaaS).\n\nThis means prioritising the products, tools and technologies that can now be delivered as services over a network instead of on-site, thereby cutting IT infrastructure costs. On that front, public services are on the right track: in its 2019 CIO Survey, Gartner found that 39% of government CIOs are planning to spend the greatest amount of new funding in cloud services.\n\nAll of these new tools should be monitored closely by data analytics, which can deliver information about efficiency that Gartner notes is still lacking in governments.\n\nFlexibility as a new mantra\n\n\n\nGartner's report highlights the need for more flexibility. \"Governments are not using technology effectively to be agile and more responsive to changing needs,\" said Howard.\n\nAgility is a crucial and recurring theme in the report, along with the need for digital government to be adaptive \u2013 especially when it comes to security solutions, which should constantly evolve in response to the ever-changing nature of cybersecurity threats.\n\nGuide employees through technological change\n\nNew technology solutions shouldn't scare employees off. \"People get caught up in the implications of a word like artificial intelligence,\" said Howard, \"so it is important to remind them that it is not about replacing humans, but about offloading the workflows that occupy too much government time in a wasteful way.\"\n\nThis is why the report recommends that government CIOs rephrase 'artificial intelligence' as 'augmented intelligence'. This seemingly small change could go a long way towards boosting workers' confidence in new tools.\n\nThe report also notes that public services lag behind when it comes to training personnel for the digital age. A digitally-empowered workforce is key to ensuring that employees remain engaged and deliver work productively. As a result, says Gartner, organisations should invest in digital transformation initiatives that will give workers more autonomy.", "description": "Gartner\u2019s 2019-2020 report on tech trends in government suggests that agility, analytics, augmented intelligence and more can make a difference in the public sector.", "authors": ["Daphne Leprince-Ringuet"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/07/5d8f9cb7-5ec7-457e-aec7-0bd4b03c9f49/thumbnail/770x578/c54d1e802de76c65dfad61923552d082/istock-1022887882.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
