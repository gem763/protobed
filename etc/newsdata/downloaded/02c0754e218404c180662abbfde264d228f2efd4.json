(Note: both the Kardashians and Jordyn dent this\u2014and considering Jordyn and her former best friend Kylie Jenner no longer hang out, it seems pretty real).\n\nAs far as \"unscripted\" goes, the Kardashians don't script their lines (maybe...hopefully...as far as we know)\u2014but either way, kinda mean of people to laugh at Kim and Kendall on live TV?!\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "OMG, I've never felt more awkward.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hUrgbWbFKs6RlphJJoazAg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/1b873595cd1d8b8e2bf52088f466ee91", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
