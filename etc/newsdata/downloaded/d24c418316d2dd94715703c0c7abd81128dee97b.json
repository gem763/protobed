You manage England, Man United and they are the two.\n\n\"Now, I wouldn't see a queue round the block. They are a million miles off.\n\n\"This is a \u00a3700m job. If someone like Allegri came in, he would want \u00a3700m to spend. They need seven players.\"", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is under increased pressure at Manchester United and Max Allegri has been touted as a potential replacement", "authors": ["Aaron Flanagan", "Image", "Reuters", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542533.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Serie-A-Sampdoria-v-Juventus.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
