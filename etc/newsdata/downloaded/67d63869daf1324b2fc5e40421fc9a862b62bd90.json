As we age our health needs evolve, so coverage is usually not the type of financial decision you can set and forget.\n\n\"In general, anytime you experience a significant lifestyle change, it's a good idea to take a moment to review your health insurance coverage and compare what you currently have to other options that might better suit your new circumstances,\" says Eric Roberge, a certified financial planner and the founder of Beyond Your Hammock.\n\nSome 158 million Americans get their health coverage through their employer or a spouse's employer, according to the Commonwealth Fund. Others can utilize the government-run Health Insurance Marketplace to shop for private coverage.\n\nEstablished by the Affordable Care Act, the Marketplace is available to most US citizens and can help narrow down private health insurance coverage options, and find out whether tax breaks are available. Open enrollment for 2020 coverage runs from November 1, 2019 to December 15, 2019, but certain life events may qualify you for a special enrollment period.\n\nBelow, Roberge shares a few signs that it may be time to review and change your health insurance, whether you are insured through your employer or the Marketplace.\n\n1. You've made a significant life change\n\nYou may qualify for a special enrollment period throughout the year when major events take place that would change your coverage, including having or adopting a baby, getting married or divorced, or losing other health coverage.\n\n\"Other changes, like buying a house or having your spouse start a business, probably don't qualify you to make a change outside of open enrollment but they can still affect your financial situation enough where changing up your insurance coverage makes sense,\" Roberge says.\n\n2. You can save money on coverage\n\nThe cost of health insurance is skyrocketing in the US. Whether you're insured through your employer or the Marketplace, annual enrollment periods are an opportunity to review how healthcare fits into your larger financial picture.\n\n\"Even if nothing major changed in your life over the past year, you still want to take a look at your health insurance options and compare costs,\" Roberge says. \"You might want to switch to a new policy if it offers some cost savings, or provides more value for your needs than your old plan.\"\n\nHe adds: \"You'll want to compare various items, including premium costs, deductibles, and what the plan covers and doesn't cover \u2014 and how any upcoming changes might influence your decision.\" If you're planning to start a family in the next year, for example, it could be worthwhile to consider new coverage options now.\n\n3. Your health needs have changed\n\nOur health is ever-evolving and the coverage options that satisfied our needs in the past won't always match the future.\n\n\"Perhaps in the past, you had a reason for scheduling more doctor's visits and you needed a plan with low co-pays and deductibles because you frequently needed to use healthcare services,\" he says. \"But maybe now your health has improved and it might make more sense to take a plan with a higher deductible but lower monthly premium to help you save money.\"\n\nIf ramping up your retirement savings has become your top priority, he says, perhaps it's time to find a high deductible health plan that offers a health savings account, which you can use to invest savings to pay for future medical expenses.\n\nUltimately, Roberge says, \"the right health insurance coverage for you is highly dependent on your specific situation \u2014 both health-wise and financially speaking.\"\n\nMore personal finance coverage", "description": "A new baby, job, or spouse, and evolving health needs and shifting financial priorities are good reasons to review your health insurance coverage.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d82953f2e22af12c67ccb25-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
