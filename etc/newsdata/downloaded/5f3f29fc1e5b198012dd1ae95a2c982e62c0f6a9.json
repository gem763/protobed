Before the deal\u2019s announcement, Turkish-backed forces had encircled the town and were battling fierce resistance from Kurdish fighters inside.\n\nThe Syrian Kurds raised further uncertainty over a cease-fire deal that already was vague on key points and left significant questions unanswered. The self-rule administration said some provisions of the cease-fire deal \u201cneed further discussion with the United States.\u201d\n\nIt did not specify which provisions, but the Kurds have not publicly committed to a central term of the deal - a pullout of their fighters from the border region. A spokesman for the Kurdish-led fighters said Friday they were not withdrawing from Ras al-Ayn because Turkish forces are still besieging and shelling it.\n\nCriticism of the cease-fire deal - which President Donald Trump called \u201ca great day for civilization\u201d - mounted. EU Council President Donald Tusk said it was \u201cnot a cease-fire, it is a demand for the capitulation of the Kurds\u201d and called on Turkey to immediately halt its operation in northeast Syria. French President Emmanuel Macron called the Turkish operation \u201cmadness.\u201d\n\nTurkish shelling hit in and around Ras al-Ayn on Friday morning, raising columns of smoke, seen by an Associated Press journalist in Ceylanpinar on the Turkish side of the border, but none was seen after 10:30 a.m., and only sporadic gunfire was heard from inside the town.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Rojava Information Center said fighting continued into the afternoon as Turkish-backed Syrian fighters clashed with Kurdish forces in villages on the outskirts of Ras al-Ayn. The Kurdish-led force said five of its fighters were killed and a number of civilians wounded in a Turkish airstrike on one of the villages.\n\nOther activists reported a new exodus of civilians from the villages. Gun battles and shelling continued around a hospital in the center of Ras al-Ayn, and those injured inside could not be evacuated, said Mustafa Bali, spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The Kurdish Red Crescent said it was unable to enter the town to evacuate the wounded because of fighting.\n\nKurdish fighters said the fighting quieted around 4 p.m.\n\nIn its statement, the Kurdish-led administration said Turkey \u201chas not adhered with the cease-fire until now in some areas,\u201d particularly in Ras al-Ayn.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied any fighting took place Friday and said Kurdish fighters had begun withdrawing, a claim the Kurds denied.\n\nA senior U.S. official said they were awaiting confirmation on the reported fighting. The official said it takes time for information to filter down to field units especially for forces without strong command and control. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nThe cease-fire agreement - reached after hours of negotiations in Turkey\u2019s capital between Erdogan and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence - requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border. That arrangement would largely solidify the position Turkey has gained after days of fighting. The Turks and the Kurds appear to disagree on the size of the area covered by the cease-fire. Turkey calls it a \u201cpause\u201d not a cease-fire.\n\nIt remains unclear if the Kurdish-led force was on board with pulling back even if a pause in fighting firmly takes hold.\n\nPence said the U.S. was already coordinating with it on a withdrawal. But American sway with the group has diminished after Trump turned his back on it by withdrawing U.S. soldiers from northeast Syria, opening the way for Turkey to launch its invasion 10 days ago.\n\nThe Kurdish-led force\u2019s commander, Mazloum Abdi, said Thursday night that it would abide by the cease-fire and \u201cdo our best to make it successful.\u201d He did not mention any withdrawal.\n\nAsked about a withdrawal, a force spokesman, Mervan, said \u201cso far there is nothing,\u201d pointing to the continuing siege of Ras al-Ayn. \u201cIt seems that under this deal they want to commit more massacres,\u201d he said. He uses a nom de guerre in accordance with the group\u2019s regulations.\n\nA member of the Syrian Kurdish force ruled out any pull-back from border towns, calling the U.S. deal with Turkey an \u201cinsult\u201d and saying \u201cno way this will work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think we will just leave our land and our people to Turks if we are asked,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can come and take the land by force. Nobody should expect us to leave our land.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does the U.S. think to enforce a deal without presence on the ground?\u201d he added, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nElsewhere, no fighting was heard Friday along the stretch of the border that has been the main theater of the Turkish assault, running from Ras al-Ayn about 125 kilometers (75 miles) west to the Turkish-held town of Tal Abyad. Kurdish fighters have already been driven out of much, but not all, of that territory.\n\nTrump framed the U.S. cease-fire deal with Turkey as \u201ca great day for civilization,\u201d but it aims to patch up a foreign policy crisis widely seen to be of his own making.\n\nTurkish troops and their allied Syrian fighters launched the offensive two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing American troops from the border area. The Kurdish-led forces have since invited the Syrian government\u2019s military, backed by Russia, to deploy there to protect them from Turkey. Syrian troops have already rolled into several key points along the border.\n\nThe Kurds were U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State since 2014, but Turkey considers the Kurdish fighters terrorists because of their links to outlawed Kurdish rebels fighting inside Turkey since the 1980s. Turkey has said its security depends on clearing them out of a border \u201csafe zone.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s pro-government dominated media hailed the cease-fire agreement as a clear win for Erdogan. \u201cGreat Victory\u201d read Yeni Safak\u2019s banner headline. \u201cTurkey got everything it wanted.\u201d Sabah newspaper headlined: \u201cWe won both on the field and on the (negotiating) table.\u201d\n\n____\n\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut.
