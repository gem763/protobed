He said he was doing all he could to be able to play Thursday, but it appears he didn\u2019t have enough time on the short week.\n\nThielen is tied for the NFL lead with six receiving touchdowns. His season started slow as the Vikings tried to run the ball much more, limiting passing opportunities, but things have turned around for Minnesota\u2019s passing attack in October.\n\nWhile the Redskins don\u2019t have to worry about Thielen, the Vikings still have Stefon Diggs, who is averaging 18.7 yards per catch and had touchdowns of 62 and 51 yards two weeks ago against Philadelphia.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
