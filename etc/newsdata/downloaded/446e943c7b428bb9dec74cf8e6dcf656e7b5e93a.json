Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide. A federal judge blocked Missouri\u2019s ban performing an abortion after eight weeks \u2014 before a woman may know she is pregnant.\n\nAdditionally, Missouri\u2019s Planned Parenthood has been fighting for its ability to perform abortions.\n\nIn May, Planned Parenthood said in a statement to CBS News that Missouri\u2019s health department was \u201crefusing to renew\u201d the abortion license for the only clinic in the state \u2014 which could have been the first time a state has had no abortion access since the landmark high court ruling.\n\nPreliminary injunctions have allowed the clinic to stay open, but they must still force patients to go through a 72 hour waiting period and receive anti-abortion literature through state-mandated counseling.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
