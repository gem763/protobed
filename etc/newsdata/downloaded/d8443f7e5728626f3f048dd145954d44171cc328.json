He demanded the full payment from my mother. My parents had no choice but to sell their land to pay.\"\n\nFour out of five refugees seeking safety in Bangladesh between January 2018 and June 2019 were women or children.\n\n\"Women and girls, especially those travelling on their own, reported incidents of sexual exploitation and gender-based violence,\" the report said.\n\nIn the case of maritime movements, an estimated 59 percent of individuals who moved irregularly by sea, or attempted to, were also women or children.\n\nThis represents a notable change from the period of 2013-2015 when the large majority of persons engaging in similar journeys were mostly men, the report said.", "description": "Rate of fatalities rises among refugees and asylum seekers who embark on sea journeys in Southeast Asia, report says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/7535fc6b4a50423c947bf5799de92353_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
