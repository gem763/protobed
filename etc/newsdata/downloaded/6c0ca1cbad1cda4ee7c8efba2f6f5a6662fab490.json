The meeting could decide whether there is a chance for peace in northeastern Syria.\n\nMeeting at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin and Erdogan will discuss \u201cdevelopments\u201d in Syria and the \u201cnormalization of the situation in the country\u2019s northeastern regions,\u201d according to the Kremlin. Discussions will also include \u201ccountering international terrorist groups and promoting the political settlement process.\u201d\n\nAnkara was vague and diplomatic about the upcoming meeting, with Erdogan saying he would discuss the situation with the Russian leader and \u201ctake the necessary steps\u201d afterwards, without explaining what that might entail.\n\nHe offered a few hints on Saturday during a speech in the city of Kayseri, which was aired by the broadcaster NTV. Noting that Syrian troops and their Russian allies have moved into the 20-mile \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border, Erdogan said he would raise that issue with Putin and \u201cimplement [Turkey\u2019s] own plans\u201d if they fail to resolve it, according to TASS.\n\n\u201cIn case the promises to Turkey are not fulfilled, we won\u2019t be waiting as before. We will be going ahead with the operation and will keep on destroying terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey launched an incursion into northern Syria, dubbed \u2018Operation Peace Spring,\u2019 on October 9, targeting the Kurdish militias that have held the area since the defeat of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). Ankara considers these militias, which were allied with the US, to be terrorist groups linked to the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\n\nCondemned by its NATO allies and threatened with sanctions by Washington, Turkey agreed to suspend operations on October 17, pending a Kurdish withdrawal. By that time, however, US troops pulling out of the contested zone were already being replaced by Syrian Army forces, under an agreement struck between the Kurds and Damascus. This has effectively removed Ankara\u2019s pretext for the invasion in the first place.\n\nOn Monday, Erdogan told an international forum in Istanbul that his government has \u201cnever sat down to negotiate with terrorist groups,\u201d and he does not intend to start now. While this is no doubt popular with his constituency at home, no one has asked him to participate in any such negotiations.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018America is running away\u2019: Irate Kurds pelt withdrawing US forces with vegetables (VIDEO)\n\nJust last month, the Turkish president hosted a trilateral meeting on the future of Syria with Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Ankara. Turkey has been a key player in the Astana peace process, seeking to negotiate a political settlement of the Syrian conflict. The Kremlin would probably not be talking about a Syrian constitutional convention if Erdogan seriously intended to continue military operations.\n\nAnother very telling fact is that the troops that moved into Syria as part of \u2018Peace Spring\u2019 were not Turkish regulars, but the so-called \u201cmoderate rebels,\u201d Turkey-backed militants fighting for regime change in Syria \u2013 who can be easily disavowed.\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as the five-day ceasefire in northern Syria nears its end.
