The Saudis on Wednesday displayed missile and drone wreckage at a press conference, and cited other evidence they alleged shows the raid was \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d\n\nIran, which has denied involvement in the attack, warned the U.S. it will retaliate immediately if it is targeted. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif separately accused U.S. allies and officials of trying to \u201cdeceive\u201d President Donald Trump into entering a war against Tehran.\n\nPompeo wrote his tweet early Thursday after his meeting with Prince Mohammed over Saturday\u2019s drone and cruise missile attack on a crucial oil CL.1, +1.15% BRN00, +0.62% processing facility and oil field. Yemen\u2019s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have claimed the attack, but the U.S. alleges Iran carried out the assault.\n\nPompeo called the attacks \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. stands with #SaudiArabia and supports its right to defend itself,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe Iranian regime\u2019s threatening behavior will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nPompeo did not elaborate. President Donald Trump has been noncommittal on whether he would order U.S. military retaliation. He separately said Wednesday he is moving to increase financial sanctions on Tehran over the attack, without elaborating. Iran already is subject to a crushing American sanctions program targeting its crucial oil industry.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to Germany, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, told Deutschlandfunk radio on Thursday that the kingdom was still discussing how it should react to the attacks.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say right now that a military strike is being considered,\u201d the prince said. \u201cIt depends upon how the world community deals with this topic.\u201d\n\nPompeo left Jiddah on Thursday heading to the United Arab Emirates to meet with Abu Dhabi\u2019s powerful crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The UAE is a close ally of Saudi Arabia and joined the kingdom in its war in Yemen against the Houthis.\n\nThe UAE announced Thursday it had joined a U.S.-led coalition to protect waterways across the Mideast after an attack on Saudi oil installations.\n\nThe state-run WAM news agency quoted Salem al-Zaabi of the Emirati Foreign Ministry as saying the UAE joined the coalition to \u201censure global energy security and the continued flow of energy supplies to the global economy.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia joined the coalition on Wednesday. Australia, Bahrain and the United Kingdom also are taking part.\n\nPompeo tweeted his appreciation for the UAE and Saudi Arabia joining the coalition.\n\n\u201cRecent events underscore the importance of protecting global commerce and freedom of navigation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe U.S. formed the coalition after attacks on oil tankers that American officials blame on Iran, as well as Iran\u2019s seizure of tankers in the region. Iran denies being behind the tanker explosions, though the attacks came after Tehran threatened to stop oil exports from the Persian Gulf.\n\nAt the press conference Wednesday, the Saudis displayed broken and burned drones and pieces of a cruise missile that military spokesman Col. Turki Al-Malki identified as Iranian weapons collected after the attack. He also played surveillance video that he said showed a drone coming in from the north. Yemen is to the south of Saudi Arabia.\n\nEighteen drones and seven cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Al-Malki said, with three missiles failing to make their targets. He said the cruise missiles had a range of 700 kilometers (435 miles), meaning they could not have been fired from inside Yemen. That opinion was shared by weapons experts who spoke to The Associated Press .\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of weapon the Iranian regime and the Iranian IRGC are using against the civilian object and facilities infrastructure,\u201d Al-Malki said, referring to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis attack did not originate from Yemen, despite Iran\u2019s best effort to make it appear so.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian similarly was skeptical of the Houthi claim of responsibility.\n\n\u201cThis is not very credible, relatively speaking,\u201d he told CNews television on Thursday. \u201cBut we sent our experts to have our own vision of things.\u201d\n\nPompeo, who landed in Saudi Arabia shortly after the news conference Wednesday, took a harder line than his hosts, telling reporters: \u201cThe Saudis were the nation that was attacked. It was on their soil. It was an act of war against them directly.\u201d\n\nZarif in his own tweet criticized Pompeo for calling the attack an \u201cact of war.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Act of war\u2019 or AGITATION for WAR? Remnants of #B_Team (+ambitious allies) try to deceive @realdonaldtrump into war,\u201d Zarif wrote, with a hashtag he often used to refer to former national security adviser John Bolton and other world leaders.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor their own sake, they should pray that they won\u2019t get what they seek.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Iran sent a note to the U.S. via Swiss diplomats Monday, reiterating that Tehran denies involvement in the aerial attack, the country\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency reported. The Swiss have looked after American interests in Iran for decades.\n\n\u201cIf any action takes place against Iran, the action will be faced by Iran\u2019s answer immediately,\u201d IRNA quoted the note as saying. It added that Iran\u2019s response wouldn\u2019t be limited to the source of the threat.\n\nIRNA also reported that Iran\u2019s delegation to the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting has yet to receive the necessary U.S. visas. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was to travel to New York on Friday, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani following on Monday.\n\nThe U.N. meeting had been considered as an opportunity for direct talks between Rouhani and Trump.\n\nAsked in Los Angeles whether Rouhani will come to New York, Trump said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know. If it was up to me, I\u2019d let them come.\u201d\n\nAs the host of the U.N.\u2019s headquarters, the U.S. is required to offer world leaders and diplomats visas to attend meetings. But as tensions have risen, the U.S. has put increasing restrictions on Iranians like Zarif.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that America backs Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201cright to defend itself\u201d after a weekend attack targeted the heart of its...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR601_pompeo_ZG_20190919060958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
