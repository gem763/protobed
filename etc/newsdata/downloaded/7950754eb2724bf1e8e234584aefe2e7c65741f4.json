Rose", "language": "en", "text": "By Olivia Bugault\n\nSafran SA (SAF.FR) said Thursday that adjusted net profit in its first half surged, and raised its 2019 guidance for revenue and operating income while it adjusted its free-cash-flow goal for the year due to the Boeing Co. (BA) 737 MAX's global grounding.\n\nAdjusted net profit at the French aerospace company rose 45% to 1.35 billion euros ($1.49 billion) from EUR932 million a year earlier, the company said.\n\nAdjusted revenue for the period was up 27% at EUR12.1 billion, beating expectations of EUR11.26 billion from a consensus of analysts compiled by Factset. On an organic basis, adjusted revenue increased by 14.2%, it said.\n\nSafran generated EUR1.18 billion of FCF during the period, a 44% increase compared with EUR820 million a year earlier and despite the Boeing 737 MAX crisis.\n\nSafran raised its revenue and recurring operating income guidance for 2019. Adjusted revenue is expected to grow by roughly 10% on an organic basis and based on Safran's assumption of LEAP-1B deliveries to Boeing, compared with a previous forecast of roughly 10%. Adjusted recurring operating income should grow over 20%, Safran said.\n\nSafran also adjusted its FCF guidance due to the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. \"Based on an assumption of return to service for Boeing 737MAX in 4Q, free cash flow is expected to be in the range 50% to 55% of adjusted recurring operating income (previously around 55%) as recurring operating income outlook is raised,\" the company said.\n\nWrite to Olivia Bugault at olivia.bugault@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 05, 2019 01:28 ET (05:28 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
