(Photo: Focke Strangmann, EPA-EFE)\n\nHamburg Airport reopened Tuesday evening, after the travel hub was shut down for almost three hours while local emergency response teams defused a World War II-era bomb.\n\n\"Hamburg Airport just reopened,\" airport authorities said in a tweet at 10:49 pm local time. \"The WW2 bomb in Hamburg-Schnelsen was successfully defused. All waiting flights can depart/land from now on. Please keep in contact with your airline regarding your current flight status.\"\n\nOfficials tweeted hours earlier at 7:57 pm local time, that the airspace above the airport was closed due to the discovery of the bomb in the Hamburg-Schnelsen section of the German city, therefore closing the airport.\n\nAt the time of the announcement, no flights were departing or arriving and there was no estimate for how long the airport and the air space would remain shut down.\n\nAufgrund einer Bombenentsch\u00e4rfung ist der Luftraum \u00fcber dem Flughafen Hamburg aktuell gesperrt. Es k\u00f6nnen keine Starts und Landungen stattfinden. Die Dauer ist derzeit nicht bekannt.

Any defusing, the airport clarified, would be left up to the police. \"Safety first,\" they added.\n\nThe Hamburg Police tweeted: \"An old 'aircraft bomb' was found in #Niendorf during work by a specialized company.\"\n\nThe tweet also noted that they would be employing the help of the fire department and other organizations.\n\nMeanwhile, the fire department advised on Twitter that anyone in Hamburg should follow \"air-raid behavior.\" That means stay indoors, stay away from windows and as far from the danger point as possible. They also called for people to follow the instructions of emergency service operations.\n\nThis isn't the first time that a WWII-era bomb has threatened Hamburg nearly 75 years after the war ended. Last May, a 1,000-pound American-made bomb was found in the city and forced the evacuation of 6,000 people in the Heimfeld neighborhood.\n\nIn 1943, during Operation Gomorrah, which was the Allied bombing of Hamburg, the aftermath of bombs and the bombs themselves killed between 34,000 and 43,000 people, according to an article from the BBC.\n\nNote: Some of the information in the tweets was electronically translated.\n\nFollow Morgan Hines on Twitter: @MorganEmHines.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2019/10/16/world-war-ii-era-bomb-defused-hamburg-airport-reopens/4001023002/", "description": "On Tuesday at 1:57 pm EST\u00a0Hamburg Airport tweeted that \"due to a finding of a WW2 bomb in Hamburg-Schnelsen the airport is currently closed.\"", "authors": ["Morgan Hines", "Published P.M.
