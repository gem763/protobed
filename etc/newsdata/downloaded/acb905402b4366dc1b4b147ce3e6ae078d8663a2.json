I'm always disappointed when I see him criticised like that.\u201d\n\nMr Samuel, who was chairman of the ACCC during the whole of Mr Trujillo's tenure, said: \"Sol Trujillo and his team have to take an enormous amount of credit for what happened with the NBN, because it was their approach that said to government. the only way to do this is to build it ourselves.\" He added he did not use the term \"credit\" in a positive sense.\n\n\"Telstra under Sol Trujillo really made life very, very difficult for government and regulators. They did everything they could to impede competition.\"\n\nTelstra under Sol Trujillo really made life very, very difficult for government and regulators. \u2014 Graeme Samuel, former competition regulator\n\nMr Samuel said there were two key events that demonstrated this. The first was a proposal made in 2006 to the Howard government to build a fibre-to-the-node broadband network, which the government rejected at the recommendation of the ACCC. The second was Telstra's failure to lodge a compliant bid to build the NBN in 2008 during the Rudd years.\n\nOn the 2006 proposal, Mr Samuel said Telstra had wanted to charge retailers a wholesale price that was so high it would have made Telstra's retail competitors uncompetitive.\n\n\"Being owners of the network, of course they [Telstra] could beat their competitors on retail price,\" he said.\n\n\"They were saying, unless we get our way on pricing we won\u2019t agree. And the government and the ACCC said, 'No, that\u2019s not on.' The way they wanted to price things was not in the interest of the public or the interest of competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It would still have been a network owned by Telstra, and our clear view was if the network was owned by Telstra you would have a perpetuation of the anti-competitive framework. It didn\u2019t make any sense at all.\"\n\nHe also said Telstra was purposefully obstructing retailers from installing their own equipment in Telstra exchanges. \"They tried every trick in the book to prohibit competitors from getting access to the exchange,\" he said.\n\nMr McGauchie rejected Mr Samuel's claims.\n\n\"We were prepared to give competitors full access, but not at marginal cost, which is what Graeme Samuel wanted. We felt we needed to get a reasonable return on our capital, as any fair review of the facts would show. If shareholders are putting up capital, they need to get a fair return,\" he said.\n\nHe also rejected claims that Telstra blocked competitors from accessing its exchanges. \"We would never do that. I completely reject any concept that we were sabotaging anyone.\"\n\nIn 2008, the newly elected Labor government under Kevin Rudd went to tender with a new, more ambitious plan to build a national broadband network.\n\nTelstra was the obvious candidate to build it because it already owned the pits, pipes and ducts needed to roll out the new high-speed fibre optic cable. But Telstra's bid was a non-compliant 12-page document. Labor sought five separate legal opinions before ruling Telstra out of the running. When the other bids, including one from Optus, withdrew or were deemed unsuitable, the government decided to build the NBN itself.\n\nMr Samuel called Telstra's bid \"a nonsense\". He said Mr Rudd's response was: \"Telstra thinks they're running this country. I'll show them they're wrong.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Rudd government insider who was involved in the tender process told The Australian Financial Review the government's view at the time was Telstra thought it was calling its bluff, and never expected it to bypass Telstra altogether and build the network itself.\n\nMr McGauchie also rejected this interpretation. \u201cIt\u2019s all very fine to say we didn\u2019t comply. But we couldn't comply because the economics would not have worked.\u201d\n\nHe said the purpose of Telstra's bid was \"to indicate what was required economically to make the proposal work\".\n\n\"I\u2019m so cross about this idea we didn\u2019t try and help. We tried to help on both occasions. But what they wanted did not work economically,\" Mr McGauchie said. Mr Minchin backed up this position.", "description": "A row has erupted over whether or not Telstra is to blame for sabotaging the construction of the NBN, re-opening a fierce 14-year-old debate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a814efc4687727e76bfb09b14a30f4d334b15b4a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
