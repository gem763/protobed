Obviously a top player, very lucky to play under Sir Alex Ferguson,' Carragher told Sky Sports' Off Script podcast.\n\n'But all these Manchester United people forget, they never won anything without Sir Alex Ferguson, anything, nothing with England, Valencia.\n\nNeville (right) played under Ferguson (left) his full senior career and won plenty of trophies\n\nGARY NEVILLE'S HONOURS AT UNITED Premier League 1995-96, 1996-97, 1998-99, 1999-00, 2000-01, 2002-03, 2006-07, 2008-09 FA Cup 1995-96, 1998-99, 2003-04 League Cup 2005-06, 2009-10 Champions League 1998-99, 2007-08\n\n'Remember, Manchester United fell off a cliff when Sir Alex Ferguson left, how lucky were they to be with him?!\n\n'So when we talk about what they won and what they did, anyone could have done it!'\n\nNeville refused to rise to Carragher jibe by responding: 'Anyone! Haha! I can revel in the thought that I had 20 wonderful years, I don't have to answer this spurious nonsense!'\n\nCarragher's own trophy haul for Liverpool was also impressive, after he managed to win the Champions League, UEFA Cup and the FA Cup during his time as a professional.\n\nHowever, that Liverpool team from yesteryear largely lived in the shadows of their arch-rivals with United enjoying a large amount of their success under Ferguson.\n\nBut now that Liverpool are back on top, Neville has admitted that Jurgen Klopp's team remind him of United's title-winning sides.\n\nNeville admits his old rivals Liverpool remind him of title-winning Man United teams\n\nLiverpool have shown a gritty nature to their performances to remain unbeaten in the league\n\nOn Sunday the Reds came from behind against Tottenham to clinch a 2-1 win to extend their undefeated status while also maintaining a six-point cushion to Manchester City in second.\n\nNeville insists Liverpool are showing the traits of champions as they grind out results - something that was key to success during the glory days at Old Trafford.\n\n'I thought during the second half, I was going to say it on air but didn't, about the teams we played in at Manchester United,' he told Sky Sports.\n\n'There is a complete trust in this crowd, they are brilliant to watch and they are scintillating.\n\n'I agree with Jamie (Carragher) that there was only one winner at half-time and I thought that at 20 minutes to go.'", "description": "Neville helped United win the Premier League eight times while also lifting the Champions League on two different occasions but Carragher insists anyone would've achieved the same under the Scot.", "authors": ["Sam Mcevoy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20341528-0-image-a-26_1572374570650.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
