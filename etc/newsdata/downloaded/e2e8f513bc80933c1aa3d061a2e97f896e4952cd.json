That was particularly the case in tabloids in New York, where Trump struggled to climb out from beneath some tough headlines that undermined his carefully crafted master-businessman brand.\n\nSince then, Trump has revisited a theme when talking about economic crashes: emphasizing the opportunity in them.\n\nAs he has entered the political realm and now presides over an uncertain economy that could make or break his 2020 reelection, he has also talked about the political utility \u2014 and even the necessity \u2014 of recessions and crashes.\n\nTrump\u2019s most infamous comment on this came before he launched his 2016 campaign. During one of his frequent appearances on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d in 2014, he talked with the hosts about how Democrats have a political advantage in offering people government benefits, even if those things might hurt the country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cYou know what solves it?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster, then you\u2019ll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s hardly the only time he has talked about how downturns can be turned into an advantage. Here\u2019s a recap.\n\n1992: \u201cI used to say \u2014 and in fact I think I said in my first book, and maybe this was foolish, but I really meant it \u2014 that someday I\u2019d like to maybe lose everything for a period of time to see who\u2019s loyal and who\u2019s not loyal.\u201d (Interview with Charlie Rose)\n\n1999: While considering a Reform Party candidacy for president in 2000:\n\nGERALDO RIVERA: Are we headed for a crash? Are we headed \u2014 do you hear the bears galloping across Central Park? TRUMP: Well, I hope not, and I think not, but I will say this: The Reform Party nominee will have a lot better chance if there is a crash, and it could \u2014 you know, something pretty catastrophic could happen. I don\u2019t think so. I hope it\u2019s going to go on. ... I\u2019m actually rooting for a great economy. I have to tell you. if I have my choice \u2014 you mean, do I get more votes? I\u2019d like to see the economy stay. Too many people get hurt the other way.\n\n1999: \u201cIf the economy is bad at the time of the election \u2014 and you know, we have a long way to go, and lots of things can happen \u2014 the Reform Party candidate would, if it\u2019s the right candidate, have a good chance.\u201d (Matt Lauer interview)\n\n2004: While discussing the construction of Trump Place: \u201cTo be honest, the near collapse of New York during the 1990s is what got it done. If New York had been doing well, we would never have gotten the zoning for that job. It\u2019s always good to get zoning in bad times and build in good times.\u201d (Playboy interview)\n\n2004: \u201cI don\u2019t want to blame the real estate markets, because I always made a lot of money in bad markets. I love bad markets. You can do very well in a bad market.\u201d (CNN interview)\n\n2006: On predictions that the housing market was headed for a crash: \u201cI sort of hope that happens, because then people like me would go in and buy. \u2026 If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money. If you\u2019re in a good cash position \u2014 which I\u2019m in a good cash position today \u2014 then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.\u201d (Trump University audiobook \u201cHow to Build a Fortune\u201d)\n\n2007: \u201cWe\u2019re talking very minor [problems] compared with the depression of the early 1990s. \u2026 People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I\u2019m excited if it is. I\u2019ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.\u201d (Globe and Mail interview)\n\n2013: \u201cOne good aspect of the Obama depression is that it will separate the winners from the losers. If you can make it now, you deserve it!\u201d (Twitter)\n\nOne good aspect of the Obama depression is that it will separate the winners from the losers. If you can make it now, you deserve it! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2013\n\n2014: \u201cWhen the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster, then you\u2019ll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.\u201d (\u201cFox and Friends\u201d interview)\n\nApril 2016: \u201cYou know a really good businessman, when the economy crashes and you\u2019re in the middle of a big job, maybe it\u2019s a building or a deal or a factory or something, right \u2014 the really good ones are the ones that can take a catastrophe and make it good. I\u2019ve taken some deals that should be terrible and made 'em better than if the economy stayed strong. And the reason you lose it is sometimes the economy, and you know, who\u2019s going to be blamed for the economy? The politicians, maybe. But the really good ones are the ones that can take a bad condition, and you go in and you beat up the banks.\u201d (Campaign rally in Pittsburgh)\n\nMay 2016: On renegotiating debt: \u201cAnd you know debt was always sort of interesting to me. Now we\u2019re in a different situation with a country, but I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good, so therefore you can\u2019t lose.\u201d (CNBC interview)\n\nAs president, Trump has understandably less interest in a downturn \u2014 given its implication for his reelection \u2014 but even he has suggested that it might be necessary for achieving larger goals. See his comments last month about his trade war with China:\n\n\u201cI am doing this whether it\u2019s good or bad \u2014 for your statement about, \u2018Oh, will we fall into a recession for two months?\u2019 The fact is, somebody had to take China on. \u2026 Whether it\u2019s good for our country or bad for our country, short term, it had to be done.\u201d (Q&A with reporters)", "description": "Trump has repeatedly cited the utility of economic crashes, both politically and personally.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UYl3pXh-Bc8ibnlZ0RkcFZJbmE4=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-03-2019/t_8f4ee8dff5e94c7e896f460e9a5b6ef0_name_503188c8_cb7b_11e9_9615_8f1a32962e04_scaled.jpg"}
