REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nMSCI\u2019s world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.1% and was heading towards its worst weekly performance since mid-August.\n\nAsia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS earlier shed 0.2%, though Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 index fared better, gaining 0.4% on hopes of a quick resolution to the trade war.\n\nA whistleblower report released on Thursday said Trump abused his office in trying to solicit Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his political benefit, and that the White House tried to \u201clock down\u201d evidence about that conduct.\n\nThe report came after the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi this week launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump, who has denied wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWhat we are waiting to see is how this might impact the U.S.-China trade negotiations,\u201d said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that combination this week of weakening economic data and rising political uncertainty that has caused some tricky periods in markets.\u201d\n\nWall Street futures ESc1 NQcv1 were up between 0.1-0.2%.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY measuring it against a basket of currencies was up 0.1% near a three-week high of 99.146, and on track for its best week in a month.\n\nBalancing worries over the ramifications of any possible impeachment of Trump was an apparent easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\nChina\u2019s top diplomat said on Thursday that China was willing to buy more U.S. products and that trade talks would yield results.\n\nThose comments fuelled the positive mood after Trump on Wednesday praised the Chinese purchases, saying a trade deal could come sooner than people thought.\n\nEuropean shares reacted well to those signals, also getting a boost from moves in currency markets. London stocks <FTSE 100> added 0.9%, buoyed by a weaker pound after a central bank policymaker hinted at a cut in UK interest rates.\n\nThe euro EUR=EBS was pinned at its lowest level since May 2017, further helping export-oriented European stocks.\n\nThe trade war has upset financial markets and disrupted global supply chains as the world\u2019s two largest economies heap hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs on each other\u2019s products.\n\nSCEPTICISM ON MAJOR DEAL\n\nThe two sides are prepping for another round of trade talks scheduled for Oct. 10 and 11 in Washington, but investors voiced scepticism at prospects of a major breakthrough then.\n\n\u201cThere is still a huge gulf,\u201d said Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management, adding that prospects for a deal had receded from earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cAround April, May time, the main sticking point was the enforcement mechanism - but we have retreated miles from that at this point.\u201d\n\nTech remains a sticking point, with reports on Thursday that the United States is unlikely to allow American firms to supply China\u2019s Huawei Technologies undermining hopes of a broad bilateral deal.\n\nUnderlining market sensitivity, European chipmakers Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and Siltronic (WAFGn.DE) both fell around 1.5%, mirroring losses for Asian chip-related shares Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and SK Hynix (000660.KS).\n\nMajor Huawei supplier Micron Technology (MU.O) had fallen 7% in after-hours trade after it forecast first-quarter profit below Wall Street targets.\n\n\u201cTechnology is at the heart of the confrontations between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings.\n\nIn commodity markets, oil prices fell as concerns of slowing global demand growth and a faster-than-expected recovery in Saudi crude oil output eased worries over potential major supply disruptions.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures fell 27 cents, or 0.4%, to $62.47 a barrel.", "description": "World share markets dipped on Friday, with concerns about U.S. political developments after a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump denting optimism about an easing of U.S.-China trade tensions.", "authors": ["Tom Wilson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434471137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0KV", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
