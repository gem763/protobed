It now appears increasingly likely Johnson will fail to hit the deadline for a deal laid down in what he calls the \u201csurrender act\u201d.\n\nEU sources said there remained considerable doubt as to whether there was any basis for such discussions, given Johnson\u2019s insistence on there being a customs border on the island of Ireland.\n\nMeanwhile Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, was told by a series of senior figures in Belfast that the \u201cStormont lock\u201d envisaged in the proposal is unworkable, setting up a race against time to rework that aspect of the plan in time for the 17 October European council meeting.\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit plan hangs by thread as EU dismisses weekend talks Read more\n\nThe European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act, drawn up by rebel MPs and passed by parliament, states that if Westminster does not agree to a Brexit deal by 19 October, the prime minister has to write to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 until 31 January.\n\nIn extracts of legal papers submitted by the government to the court of session in Edinburgh, that emerged on Friday in a case brought by anti-Brexit campaigners, the government appeared to accept for the first time that it would have to make the request.\n\nThe papers, which the government declined to publish in full, stated that the prime minister accepts \u201che is subject to the public law principle that he cannot frustrate its purpose or the purpose of its provisions. Thus he cannot act so as to prevent the letter requesting the specified extension in the act from being sent.\u201d\n\nCampaigners brought the legal action to force Johnson to comply with the requirements of the act, also known as the Benn Act, after a series of suggestions from Downing Street sources that Johnson believes he has found a loophole in the law that will allow him to leave the EU on 31 October regardless.\n\nThe UK government refused to release copies of its submissions in this case to the media despite repeated requests by the Guardian, the BBC and other news organisations.\n\nKey excerpts of its pledge were read out instead by Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer for the green energy millionaire Dale Vince, the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC, and the lawyer and anti-Brexit campaigner Jolyon Maugham QC.\n\nO\u2019Neill told Lord Pentland, the judge hearing the case, that Johnson had repeatedly contradicted that position, including in the Commons on Wednesday, by insisting the UK would leave on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d.\n\nAs a result, O\u2019Neill said, the court still needed to issue legally binding orders to force Johnson to comply with the Benn Act in an interdict, or injunction. If the prime minister refused to do so, O\u2019Neill could return to court to ask for Johnson to be fined or jailed, he added. Pentland is due to give his ruling on Monday.\n\nNo 10 declined to comment. Yet senior government figures, including some cabinet ministers, continue to insist privately that while they will obey the law as narrowly interpreted, they can still avoid any delay to Brexit.\n\nAn attempt to circumvent the law would almost certainly result in another bitter court battle for the government \u2013 but Johnson\u2019s allies hope he could thereby present himself as the man trying to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d in the face of obstructionist remainers.\n\nWith a Brexit delay forced on him, Johnson could then fight a general election on a platform of a hard Brexit.\n\nSenior government insiders suggest that to confront the challenge from the Brexit party, the Conservatives would have to promise to strike an even tougher bargain than the one the prime minister is currently offering to Brussels.\n\nThe backbench rebels who drew up the Benn bill hoped to avert a no-deal Brexit; but Johnson has angrily accused them of undermining the government\u2019s negotiating position.\n\nIn Brussels on Friday, a European commission spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have completed discussions with the UK for today. We gave our initial reaction to the UK\u2019s proposals and asked many questions on the legal text.\n\n\u201cWe will meet again on Monday to give the UK another opportunity to present its proposals in detail.\u201d The spokeswoman added that the proposals did not \u201cprovide a basis for concluding an agreement\u201d.\n\nA senior EU diplomat said: \u201cIf we held talks at the weekend, it would look like these were proper negotiations. The truth is we\u2019re still a long way from that. We need to work out quickly whether there is the opportunity to close that gap.\u201d\n\nBut the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, speaking after a meeting in Belfast with the Northern Ireland secretary, struck a more upbeat note, saying a deal was \u201cnot mission impossible\u201d.\n\n\u201cI believe it is possible to change that [approach including the old backstop] but we have to make sure that while we change the approach the outcome has got to be the same,\u201d he said, adding that he believed \u201cit\u2019s possible to do that with goodwill and energy on all sides\u201d next week.\n\nBut Smith was told by several parties at the meeting that the proposal, backed by the DUP, to give the devolved government the final say on Brexit arrangements in the region after Brexit was a non-starter.\n\nOne source with knowledge of the meeting said: \u201cThe message has gone back from all quarters in Northern Ireland from Sinn F\u00e9in to the Traditional Unionist Voice that this is unworkable and it will destabilise the institutions and the Good Friday agreement and is not plausible \u2013 and in light of that, if he is serious about getting a deal, he has to come back with something more realistic.\u201d", "description": "It appears increasingly unlikely PM will hit deadline for deal laid down in Benn act", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Severin Carrell", "Daniel Boffey", "Lisa O'Carroll", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e38d9689c69f970a675d2d2a81b69ff4d805b205/487_169_3925_2355/master/3925.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15cf3179c08e72e45c5ebb505e152665", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
