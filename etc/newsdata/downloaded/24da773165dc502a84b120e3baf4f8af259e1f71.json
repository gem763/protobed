Under the tentative deal, the U.S. had agreed to suspend plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports, and Beijing had agreed to step up purchases of U.S. farm products.\n\nPi\u00f1era also said Chile wouldn't host the global U.N. global climate gathering planned for Dec. 2-13 \"thanks to the difficult circumstances that the country has seen in recent weeks.\"\n\nChile has seen 13 days of massive protests to demand greater economic equality and better public services in a country long seen as an economic success story. The demonstrations have been accompanied by some vandalism and arson, which forced the shutdown of numerous subway stations.\n\n\"This has been a very difficult decision that causes us great pain,\" Pi\u00f1era said in a televised address.\n\nAn anti-government protester walks away from the spray of a police water cannon in Santiago, Chile, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2019.

Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa issued a statement saying that \"alternative hosting options\" were being explored. And a U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to comment publicly, said that all U.N. venues are being considered as options. Those would include cities such as New York, Geneva, Bonn, Vienna and Nairobi.\n\nThe Santiago conference was meant to work out some of the remaining unresolved rules for countries on climate efforts, smoothing the way for the bigger effort in the 2020 summit: encouraging countries to up their commitments to cutting climate-changing emissions.\n\nEven if cancelling the Santiago climate conference means those rules don't get written this year, \"the absence of rules does not stop countries from acting either alone or together\" to cut emissions, said Nigel Purvis, a climate and environment negotiator in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. \"It really shouldn't slow down climate action.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ellen Knickmeyer and Paul Wiseman in Washington and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this story.\n\nChile's President Sebastian Pinera announces that he is calling off the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Forum, APEC, and Climate Change COP25 Conference, at La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, Chile, Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2019. Pinera said that the ongoing protests have led him to call off the two major international summits that his country had been scheduled to host.
