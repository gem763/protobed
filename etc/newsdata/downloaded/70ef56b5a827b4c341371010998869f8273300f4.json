Deal volume this year is on pace to beat the full-year tally for 2018 of 1,241, which was up from 1,050 in 2017, Hampleton said in a report Wednesday.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nDeals struck in the first six months of 2019 had a combined value of $71 billion, the report said. They include Salesforce.com Inc. \u2019s roughly $15 billion acquisition of data-analytics platform Tableau Software Inc. and Dassault Systemes SE\u2019s $5.8 billion purchase of Medidata Solutions Inc., a cloud-based software maker for life-science companies. Both deals were announced in June.\n\nHampleton said 66% of enterprise-software M&A deals this year were strategic moves by companies looking to use the technology, while 34% were carried out by private-equity firms or financial holding companies.\n\nMost acquisition targets are ventures that develop software tools for big-data analytics, business intelligence and data visualization, the report said.\n\nMr. Simnett said corporate customers of these tech providers are in the market for software tools designed to learn more about global markets and customers, enabling them to get more out of their existing enterprise information-technology systems.\n\nBusiness-software vendors are under increasing pressure to provide these and other digital capabilities in an integrated way for their customers, said J. Neely, managing director and global M&A lead at consulting firm Accenture PLC.\n\n\u201cOftentimes it is more efficient to acquire these capabilities than to develop them in-house,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Neely said large enterprise-tech providers are pursuing M&A deals to rapidly build capabilities in analytics, blockchain and robotic process automation, among other areas.\n\nSpeed is a key factor in tech-sector deal making, according to Chris Murphy, a managing director at ThoughtWorks Inc., a software consultancy.\n\nMany buyers are approaching acquisitions as a way to quickly gain access to key talent, intellectual property and other assets before their competitors snap them up, Mr. Murphy said.\n\nIn addition to tech giants, companies outside the tech sector are acquiring smaller enterprise-software ventures in a bid to expand in-house capabilities in areas such as business intelligence and artificial intelligence, analysts said.\n\nJames Anderson, a research director at Gartner Inc., said nontech companies are seeking out applications that can tie together multiple functions across IT plus the finance and business sides of daily operations as a way to make more informed spending decisions.\n\nBut as demand for enterprise-software makers increases, so does the cost of acquiring them. Some industry watchers worry about a market bubble. Hampleton estimates that this year, business-software firms are selling for an average of 3.8 times their annual sales, compared with roughly 3.4 in 2018 and 3.3 in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt does raise some danger and caution for CIOs,\u201d said Melissa Di Donato, CEO of SUSE GmbH, a Germany-based open-source software company. As valuations rise, she said, senior IT managers face the risk of getting locked into a debt-laden supplier when a bubble bursts, Ms. Di Donato said.\n\nJeffrey Hammond, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., said he is less concerned about the impact on CIOs of inflated valuations for enterprise-software ventures, so long as it doesn\u2019t affect the prices they charge for technology.\n\nMr. Neely of Accenture said CIOs need to ensure their companies have a playbook for software-maker acquisitions that factors in a target\u2019s annual recurring revenue, potential revenue and the expected costs of integrating it into the rest of the company.\n\nThey need to make sure acquirers have identified risks to existing revenue streams and any \u201cbig rocks\u201d ahead that could disrupt services, he said.\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "Large technology companies are buying enterprise-software makers in record numbers, even as prices continue to climb.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-96914/social"}
