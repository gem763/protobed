T -1.58% Chief Executive Randall Stephenson defended his strategy and likely successor in his first public remarks since an activist hedge fund challenged the company to change direction.\n\nSpeaking at a Goldman Sachs \u2019 conference in New York, the telecom boss said newly named chief operating officer John Stankey was the right pick to make the Dallas company\u2019s telecommunications, media and advertising businesses work together more effectively. The chairman and CEO said his board considered a short list of potential candidates who could turn around divisions with old business models, succeed in telecom and manage a media division.\n\n\u201cIt was a very short list, and John Stankey quickly rose to the top,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said on Tuesday.\n\nThe AT&T CEO\u2019s response came a week after hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. revealed a small stake in the telecom giant and called on the company to consider shedding several of the businesses it took on during a five-year acquisition spree. The activist investor saved special criticism for AT&T\u2019s purchase and integration of satellite provider DirecTV, which has been losing subscribers. It also questioned whether the recent $80 billion-plus acquisition of Time Warner made strategic sense.\n\nElliott had studied the company for months but was spurred to action by Mr. Stankey\u2019s promotion, according to people familiar with the matter. AT&T earlier this month said Mr. Stankey would take the No. 2 job under Mr. Stephenson while keeping his title as CEO of the Time Warner business, a collection of film and TV assets since renamed WarnerMedia.\n\nMr. Stephenson, who has been CEO for a dozen years, didn\u2019t address his timeline for handing over the top job at the company, though he said Mr. Stankey has enough experience in both media and telecom to do the job well. Mr. Stephenson has privately discussed retiring as soon as next year, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cThe board hasn\u2019t informed me I\u2019m retiring yet,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said, adding that Mr. Stankey is \u201cin pretty good position\u201d to take the top job if he does well in the new post.\n\nThe AT&T boss also praised his lieutenant\u2019s work planning for the upcoming HBO Max streaming video service, which will compete with Netflix Inc. and other new streaming entrants.\n\nInside the company, some executives have been confused by the shifting video strategy. Initially, AT&T touted a three-tiered streaming service, but Mr. Stankey switched gears earlier this year and decided to launch a single service.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be different,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney . This is not Hulu.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think comments asking for operational changes have affected Mr. Stephenson\u2019s approach? Join the conversation below.\n\nOn Tuesday, AT&T said it has struck a deal for streaming rights to reruns of the hit comedy \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d which ended a 12-year run on CBS last spring. Terms of the agreement weren\u2019t disclosed. A person familiar with the matter said the five-year deal was worth more than $600 million. It renews an existing agreement with WarnerMedia\u2019s TBS cable channel.\n\nAT&T has said it will start a beta or test version of HBO Max in late October with plans for a bigger rollout next year. It hasn\u2019t announced a price, though it is expected to cost close to the $15 a month charged for traditional HBO, according to people familiar with the project.\n\nThe service will feature HBO shows and films, as well as content from WarnerMedia, which owns the Warner Bros. studio and cable channels like Cartoon Network and CNN. HBO Max has also acquired streaming rights to the show \u201cFriends\u201d starting in 2020.\n\n\u2014Joe Flint contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com", "description": "AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson defended his choice of a likely successor in his first public remarks since activist hedge fund Elliott Management\u2019s challenge to the company\u2019s strategy.", "authors": ["Drew Fitzgerald", "Andrew.Fitzgerald Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107537/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
