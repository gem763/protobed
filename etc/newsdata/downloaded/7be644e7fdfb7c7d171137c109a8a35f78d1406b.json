Frommer is the author of You Gotta Have Heart, a history of Washington baseball, from which some of this story is based, and head of the Sports Business Practice at the Dewey Square Group, a public affairs firm in Washington.\n\nThe last time Washington won a World Series title, the Houston Astros didn\u2019t exist. There weren\u2019t even divisions, much less a wild card\u2014the ticket the Nationals punched to make the postseason.\n\nTo make it to the Fall Classic in 1924, the Senators had to finish first in the American League, and nobody saw them coming. Washington was coming off a fourth-place finish the year before, a woeful 23 \u00bd games out of first place. The New York Yankees, anchored by Babe Ruth, who hit .393 with 41 home runs, had won the 1923 pennant going away, their third straight AL title.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nToppling one of the greatest baseball teams ever assembled endeared the Senators not only to their hometown fans, but the nation as a whole, which picked up the banner of the underdogs from Washington as they stared down an equally formidable New York Giants roster in the World Series. In the Roaring \u201820s, the country\u2019s mood was too buoyant to harbor any partisan ill-will toward the capital. The Republican president was kind of quiet and didn\u2019t like to say nasty things about his opponents, even in an election year. Nobody was screaming about the \u201cDeep State,\u201d though the previous occupant of the White House hadn\u2019t exactly distinguished himself in the ethical department. Baseball (the only team sport that mattered at the time) was, like bathtub gin, something that everyone could get behind. Especially when it was as unpredictable as the 1924 season.\n\nLike this year\u2019s Nats, who started out 19-31, the Senators got off to a slow start. They were a team in flux, with their fifth manager\u2014untested 27-year-old player-manager Bucky Harris\u2014in as many seasons. Nevertheless, their owner, Clark Griffith, had somewhat improbably predicted in spring training, \u201cThose boys are going to get somewhere this year.\u201d In mid-June, they hadn\u2019t come close to justifying their boss\u2019 optimism. The team\u2019s record was 24-26, good for sixth place, 4 \u00bd games behind the first-place Yankees. Then they won five in a row heading into a four-game series at Yankee Stadium, and stunned the Bronx Bombers by sweeping the series, to take over the top spot.\n\n\u201cOh You Nationals!\u201d the Washington Post exclaimed. \u201cWashington fans for the first time in their lives will experience the thrill of seeing the home representatives take the field tomorrow afternoon as the official defender of first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington got hot quicker than almost any club I ever saw,\u201d Babe Ruth later wrote in his autobiography.\n\nThe Senators (also known as the Nationals back then) streaked to a .636 second-half winning percentage, nearly identical to the Nats\u2019 .630 this year, and won the affection of the nation by disrupting the stranglehold the Yankees had on the American League. Fans were especially rooting for the Senators\u2019 aging pitching icon, 36-year-old Walter Johnson, who had never had a chance to pitch in the World Series.\n\nJohnson had a reputation as one of the nicest guys in baseball. One of his nicknames was \u201cThe Big Swede,\u201d even though he was of German descent, but he never corrected it. \u201cThere are a lot of nice Swedish people, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to offend anybody.\u201d\n\nWill Rogers seemed to capture the national mood in a syndicated column titled, \u201cEverybody Is Pulling for Walter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is more real genuine interest in him than there is in a presidential election,\u201d Rogers wrote in the late September piece, about five weeks before President Calvin Coolidge won re-election in a landslide. \u201cHe is not sick, yet there are lots and lots of people in all parts of our country that never saw him or hope to see him, that are actually praying for fate to smile on this Big Old Country Boy.\u201d\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t disappoint that season, going 23-7 with a 2.72 ERA, leading the league in earned run average, strikeouts and shutouts.\n\n\u201cEven in New York,\u201d Rogers wrote, \u201camong the rabid Yankees rooters, if they must be beaten, they want Walter to beat them.\u201d\n\nThis year, some people outside Washington have expressed a similarly warm feeling toward the Nats. Both the Senators\u2014who didn\u2019t win a pennant until that 1924 season, and the Nats, who won their first pennant this year\u2014were seen as deserving of their turn in the sun.\n\nIndeed, after the Nationals swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series, Bernie Miklasz, a sports talk show host in St. Louis and contributor to The Athletic St. Louis, graciously said on his show: \u201cIf the Cardinals had to go down, have them go down to Washington, which has not experienced a World Series in our lifetime.\u201d\n\nWalter Johnson paced a Senators pitching staff that posted a league-best 3.34 ERA. Washington\u2019s offense, meanwhile, couldn\u2019t match the high-octane power of the Yankees\u2014Babe Ruth\u2019s 46 homers were more than twice Washington\u2019s team total\u2014but Washington had an effective small-ball style of play. Outfielder Goose Goslin led the team with a .344 average and 12 homers, one of three regulars to hit over .320, along with outfielder Sam Rice and first baseman Joe Judge.\n\nSo enamored of the Senators were fans around the country that they often rooted for the swashbuckling Washingtonians against their own teams. The unusual boost helped the Senators to play .584 on the road that year. A key test came late in the season. The Senators had a two-game lead over the Yankees as they embarked on a 20-game, season-ending road trip\u201416 games in the Midwest, before wrapping up the season at Fenway Park in Boston.\n\nBucky Harris told his players: \u201cLet\u2019s not make any enemies if we can help it. Most of the western clubs would rather see us win the pennant than the Yankees. Let\u2019s beat \u2019em, but treat \u2019em nice.\u201d\n\nDuring the road trip, fans in Washington congregated around office buildings and grocery stores, where the scores were posted every half-inning on scoreboards.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt as to the popularity of a Washington victory,\u201d The New York Times wrote in an editorial after the Senators inched close to the pennant with a late-season victory in Boston. \u201cAll over the major league circuits the fans have been cheering for the Senators. In Boston, the crowd stood up and cheered every time they scored \u2026 In New York there is no question that if the Yanks cannot win, Washington is the next choice.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, in the penultimate game of the season, Washington clinched its first pennant with a 4-2 victory over the Red Sox. The road-field advantage the Senators enjoyed burst into full display in an incredible scene: hundreds of Boston fans stormed onto the field to mob the victorious players.\n\nAnd in Washington, despite a soaking rain, fans followed the action on the scoreboards, and threw their umbrellas and hats into the air when the final score was posted.\n\n\u201cAll over the city tonight baseball talk was humming,\u201d the Chicago Tribune reported, in a sentence that could have described Washington after the Nats clinched their first pennant last week. \u201cCigar stores, hotel lobbies, fashionable cabarets, everywhere it was baseball. The sandlot spirit of Main street held the city. Washington, excited and happy, gurgled like a 2 year old over his first toy.\u201d\n\nA couple of days later, 100,000 people attended a celebratory parade on Pennsylvania Avenue. At the Ellipse, President Coolidge referred to the baseball mania that had swept the city by joking about lost productivity in the city: \u201cWhen the entire population reached the point of requiring the game to be described play-by-play, I began to doubt whether the highest efficiency was being promoted.\u201d\n\nWashington had gone 14-6 in that season-ending road trip\u2014the same record the Nats had in their final 20 games this year.\n\nTuesday night, the Nats will take the field in Houston as big underdogs; the Senators faced similar odds against the New York Giants in the \u201924 World Series. The Giants, like the Astros team, had won the World Series two seasons earlier and had a formidable lineup and pitching staff. The Giants hit a league-best .300, and also led the league in on-base percentage and slugging percentage\u2014three categories that Houston also paced the league in this year.\n\nNew York was stacked with future Hall-of-Famers such as Hack Wilson, Frankie Frisch and Ross Youngs, and had won their fourth straight National League pennant (edging out yet another good New York City team, the Brooklyn Robins\u2014later known as the Dodgers).\n\nBut the Senators batboy, identified only as \u201cFrankie\u201d in a newspaper story, said the experts had it all wrong: What\u2019s all the fuss about? Goodnight, the time to shout was a month ago. Why, it was a cinch. We had that pennant all ironed out and properly creased with a special place built for it in my bat bag four weeks ago. The Giants? Say, you\u2019re not kidding me, are you? If you\u2019ve got any extra money and want to make a lot more, easy, see, soak it all on the Nats. They\u2019re there, I tell you.\n\nThe New York Times noted the Senators \u201care liked everywhere because they are young and dashing and enthusiastic. New York is hated because it has won too many pennants and possesses too much money and is too powerful.\u201d\n\nMost agreed that if Washington were to have a shot at pulling off an upset, it would need a strong performance from ace Walter Johnson, who was the obvious choice for the Game 1 start at Griffith Stadium in Washington. President Coolidge threw out the first pitch, but it was umpire Tom Connolly who showed athleticism by leaping for the errant throw from the president to make a one-handed catch.\n\nFor eight innings, Giants lefty Art Nehf outpitched Johnson and took a 2-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth, but Washington rallied to tie the score. In an era before pitch counts, both starters soldiered on for three more innings, before Johnson tired in the 12th. He walked two and surrendered a single, loading the bases with no outs, and the Giants cashed in for two runs. Washington clawed back for one run in the bottom of the frame but left the potential tying run at third, and finally fell 4-3.\n\nThe Senators took two of the next three games to tie the series at two games each, and Johnson returned to the mound for the pivotal fifth game. But once again he didn\u2019t have his best stuff, giving up 13 hits and six runs (four earned) in eight innings, ultimately losing 6-2 in his last scheduled start.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very encouraging to know that I\u2019ll finish up my career in the big leagues with two World Series defeats, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll come back next year,\u201d a dejected Johnson said.\n\nWashington won game six to even up the series, setting up a decisive seventh game at Griffith Stadium. Trailing 3-1, the Senators rallied to tie the score in the eighth inning when Bucky Harris hit a ground ball to third base that took a bad bounce over the third baseman\u2019s head, scoring two runs.\n\nFans threw hats, coats, and ripped up newspapers on the field, and the game had to be stopped for several minutes.\n\nIn the top of the ninth, Harris, the manager, summoned Walter Johnson from the bullpen, offering him a chance for redemption. But the pitcher nearly lost the game and the series, giving up a one-out triple to Frisch. He wriggled out of the jam, though, and lasted four scoreless innings.\n\nIn the bottom of the 12th, the Senators put two runners on base with one out. Earl McNeely hit a smash to third base\u2014and Washington\u2019s friendly infield gave this one a providential nudge, too. The ball took another bad hop past the third baseman, and Washington catcher Muddy Ruel came around with the winning run at 5:04 p.m.\n\nThousands of Washingtonians celebrated well past midnight. \u201cIt was an Armistice Day and Mardi Gras blended into one,\u201d the Post reported. \u201cIt was the thrilling outburst of a city\u2019s joy [that] knew no bounds.\u201d\n\nThe Senators won the pennant the next year and again in 1933 but lost the World Series both times. In fact, Washington would go 95 years before winning another postseason series, when the Nationals beat the Dodgers to win the National League Division Series this year.\n\nIn doing so, they seemed to channel the 1924 World Series team. Both the Senators and Nationals won their decisive games by erasing 3-1 leads in the eighth inning; both teams brought in a starting pitcher who had struggled earlier in the series (in the Nats\u2019 case, Patrick Corbin); and both games finished on Oct. 10 (East Coast time).\n\nNow the Nats face their toughest challenge\u2014upsetting a battle-tested machine in Houston that finished off the powerhouse Yankees in six games to win the American League pennant. In fact, the Astros are the biggest World Series favorites since 2007.\n\nBut the Nats have been overcoming long odds all season. Who saw them as contenders in late May, when they were 12 games under .500? The players are probably using their underdog status as a motivation, the way the Senators did nearly a century ago.\n\nBefore the 1924 World Series, Senators first baseman Joe Judge had a quick rejoinder to a New York reporter who had predicted the Senators would be easy prey for the Giants: \u201cThis bird is going to be a lot wiser, but sadder, when this series is over.\u201d", "description": "Well, the baseball team at least.", "authors": ["Frederic J.
