Users look to Pinterest for images related to style, gardening, home d\u00e9cor and other categories.\n\nThe company said this week that its AI technology can accurately identify more than 2.5 billion objects in photos of fashion and home d\u00e9cor, such as a specific brand of men\u2019s black boots or a particular brown leather sofa. Hundreds of millions of those objects are \u201cshoppable,\u201d meaning users can click on an item\u2014or a similar recommendation\u2014and purchase it through a brand\u2019s website. Pinterest doesn\u2019t get a cut from the brand if the user makes a purchase; it makes money through ads on its platforms.\n\nFor example, users looking for inspiration for fall d\u00e9cor can find a photo of a front door that includes wreaths and pumpkins and pin it to a board. They can zoom in on particular aspects of that image, such as a pumpkin or wreath, through a feature on the company\u2019s mobile app and website called Lens, powered by AI. The technology can automatically identify the object, provide a link to retailers that sell it and show photos of similar items that can be purchased. The technology also works with photos that users upload themselves.\n\nPinterest, founded in 2010, beefed up its object-recognition technology with the acquisition of VisualGraph in 2014. The company\u2019s AI algorithms have gradually improved, in part because of more than 200 billion photos, or \u201cpins,\u201d that people have uploaded to the site over nearly a decade, said Jeremy King, the company\u2019s new head of engineering.\n\nJeremy King, Pinterest's head of engineering Photo: Pinterest Inc.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re building something that\u2019s based on machine learning or computer-vision technology, what you need is a giant corpus of data,\u201d said Mr. King, a former Walmart Inc. technology executive who joined Pinterest about six months ago ahead of its initial public offering. \u201cPinterest is the master of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople come to Pinterest with shopping intent, and oftentimes in the past they had to leave Pinterest to go find the item,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re making it easier to get to the retailer.\u201d\n\nThe technology could be critical to Pinterest\u2019s monetization strategy, said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at market-research company eMarketer. Traditionally, it has been difficult for advertisers on Pinterest to truly understand the link between an impression, or a user\u2019s view of a pin, and their purchase behavior, Mr. Lipsman said.\n\nBecause Pinterest can identify more objects within a photo, it can show more recommendations for users to purchase. That direct link could be critical in helping advertisers better understand their return on investment. Pinterest \u201cis one of the most interesting marketing and advertising plays\u2026but at the same time, they have a lot to prove,\u201d Mr. Lipsman said.\n\nThe company is up against competition from Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google, which has recently ramped up efforts in online shopping, and Facebook Inc. \u2019s Instagram. Facebook earlier this year said it acquired visual shopping and AI startup GrokStyle Inc.\n\nPinterest reported revenue of $261.2 million for the quarter ending June 30, up 62% from a year earlier. Its global average revenue per user was 88 cents, up 29%. The company posted a net loss of $1.16 billion, weighed down by costs associated with its IPO.\n\nThe company spends \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d scraping brands\u2019 websites to make sure the products it is recommending to users for purchase are in stock, Mr. King said. The eventual goal is to give users the ability to purchase any object in any photo by linking to the brand\u2019s website, he said.\n\nPinterest depends on Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s cloud service, Amazon Web Services, for the vast majority of its computing and storage capabilities. Its AI-based visual-search engine is built by in-house software engineers as opposed to relying on cloud-based AI tools.\n\nMr. King reports to Pinterest\u2019s Chief Executive Ben Silbermann, who spoke about the focus of getting users \u201cfrom inspiration to action\u201d in the company\u2019s most recent earnings call. Letting users purchase products they discover through the application is an \u201cessential\u201d value proposition for both customers and advertisers, which will lead to an independent revenue stream in the long run, Mr. Silbermann said, without specifying when.\n\nQ&A with Jeremy King Jeremy King surprised the retail industry earlier this year when he announced he was leaving Walmart Inc., where he drove a number of initiatives as its U.S. chief technology officer, for Pinterest Inc. We talked with Mr. King about the factors that drove his departure and what he wants to do next. Q: Why did you decide to leave Walmart?\n\nA: I had done a run there, almost eight years. We\u2019re empty-nesting and wanted to move back to San Francisco [from another part of the Bay Area]....And I felt I had rebuilt both the e-commerce platform and a big chunk of the stores\u2019 platform already so it wasn\u2019t like there was a million new things to do. It seemed like a good time.\n\nI had done a run there, almost eight years.

It seemed like a good time. Q: Why Pinterest? What was the opportunity you saw?\n\nA: The intent was to take a year off [from Walmart] and decide what to do next. I got introduced to Ben [Silbermann, CEO of Pinterest] and had a great conversation with him about not only the technical challenges but the road ahead and the capabilities there. The number of people that said \u201cOh my God, I love Pinterest,\u201d is literally like eight out of 10. I just wanted to go to a place that had a product that people loved.\n\nThe intent was to take a year off [from Walmart] and decide what to do next.

Q: How do the challenges at Pinterest differ from those at Walmart?\n\nA: I think the challenges here are all digital [commerce], whereas some of the ones at Walmart were more physical [commerce]. Here, I\u2019m spending more time on just the ability to effectively take our platforms and scale them up by 10 or 20 [times]....Also, Walmart was very siloed. I was in charge of the U.S. business and Pinterest is very much a global platform.\n\nI think the challenges here are all digital [commerce], whereas some of the ones at Walmart were more physical [commerce].

Q: What\u2019s the biggest misconception about Pinterest?\n\nA: People think of us as a social network and we\u2019re really not. We\u2019re a discovery engine. People come to Pinterest for themselves.\n\nWrite to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com", "description": "The company is leveraging its AI technology, fed by billions of images, to entice more users into buying items they see on its website or mobile app\u2014and to expand its user base, which would translate into more advertising dollars.", "authors": ["Sara Castellanos", "Sara.Castellanos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108915/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
