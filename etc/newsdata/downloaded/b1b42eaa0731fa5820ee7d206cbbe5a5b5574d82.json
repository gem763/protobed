I think we will be battling for a good few races.\u201d\n\nBottas jumped from third to first with an electric start to win in Japan ahead of Vettel and Hamilton.\n\nWith only Bottas now able to overtake Hamilton in the standings, Mercedes clinched an unprecedented sixth successive world championship double of drivers and constructors titles.\n\nHamilton dedicated the achievement to the team\u2019s former non-executive director Niki Lauda, who died in May.\n\n\u201cIt definitely feels a little bit different,\u201d Hamilton said of the three-time Formula One world champion.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say as happy as previously because naturally we lost Niki this year and it doesn\u2019t feel the same without him.\n\n\u201cEvery time I walk into the garage I see Niki\u2019s headphones and his cap. I sat and I looked at it today.\n\n\u201cI think the whole team and the whole of Mercedes will probably dedicate this to Niki. I definitely do.\u201d", "description": "Suzuka (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Lewis Hamilton said he was in no hurry to win a sixth world championship after the title battle was reduced to a two-horse", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/a3decb_mercedes-british-driver-lewis-hamilton-is-on-drivers-crown-suzuka-hamilton-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
