Why? Because Target started to look for ways to cut corners:\n\nBut some store workers say the wage increases are not helping because their hours are falling, making it difficult to keep their health insurance and in some cases to pay their bills.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\u201cI got that dollar raise but I\u2019m getting $200 less in my paycheck,\u201d said one, Heather, who started in November at a Florida store working around 40 hours a week. She\u2019s now below 20 some weeks, she said. \u201cI have no idea how I\u2019m going to pay rent or buy food.\u201d\n\n[\u2026]\n\nBeyond just a drop in earnings that Target workers who spoke with CNN Business have experienced, employees who average fewer than 30 hours of work a week during the year aren\u2019t eligible to qualify for health insurance benefits through the company during annual enrollment season in the spring.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nTarget workers who say their hours have dropped have been given a variety of reasons why by their supervisors, including that there were not hours available or that their managers couldn\u2019t fit additional hours in their budgets. Others said they received no explanation for why their hours fell.\n\n\n\nOne former store director in Ohio who oversaw around 130 employees said hours dropped at the store in the past year for several reasons, including the introduction of self-checkout and elimination of backroom shifts.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if this had been predicted or something.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\u2014 Based in North Carolina, Sister Toldjah is a former liberal and a 15+ year veteran of blogging with an emphasis on media bias, social issues, and the culture wars.
