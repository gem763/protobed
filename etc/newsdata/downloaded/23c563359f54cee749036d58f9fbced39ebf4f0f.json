Those flourishes, however, come at the expense of story, yielding a movie that emphasizes its experiential and 3D qualities but lacks depth on every other front.\n\nDirector Ang Lee has an eclectic resume (\"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"The Life of Pi\"), but it includes experimenting with the number of frames per second in his last movie, \"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.\" Here, he again shoots at 120 frames per second -- compared to the traditional 24 FPS -- and in 4K 3D, which does produce enough depth to justify putting on those glasses over one's own.\n\nConceptually, \"Gemini Man\" is basically just another variation on the Jason Bourne formula, casting Smith as Henry Brogan, a government operative/assassin who -- after dozens of missions and assignments -- decides to hang up his guns.\n\nAlas, Henry inadvertently becomes privy to some information he shouldn't know, putting him in the crosshairs of his one-time handlers, under the stewardship of the ruthless Clay Verris (Clive Owen). His secretive Gemini project will eventually be employed to neutralize Henry, who is forced to go on the run with allies played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Benedict Wong.\n\nVerris boasts that he has \"the perfect asset\" for the job, which is, of course, a younger version of Henry. While the process has improved from, say, \"Tron: Legacy\" days, there's still a slightly distracting aspect to the rendering that makes this prince look not so fresh, but rather sporadically vacant.\n\nRead More", "description": "Will Smith battles himself in Ang Lee's one-dimensional thrill ride", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008093042-gemini-man-will-smith-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
