Other opposition parties, which included the DA and Cope, were also present.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence.\n\nKupido Baron, speaking on behalf of the council speaker, said they had to make the difficult decision to postpone until further notice due to imminent threats against councillors.\n\n\"We did so in the interest of protecting the democratic processes of council and to execute our duty to ensure the safety of office bearers.\"\n\nBaron said they had received threats in the past.\n\n\"However, the sheer intensity and viciousness of those received in the last 24 hours necessitated us to make this decision in consultation with the police.\"\n\nHe added a new date would be communicated when all the necessary security measures were in place to deal with the current threat.\n\nAfter two hours, the council chambers were completely cleared.\n\nAll political parties left the building and roads were reopened.\n\nEastern Cape police commissioner Liziwe Ntshinga rubbished claims that the meeting was called off on the advice of the police.\n\nLieutenant General Ntshinga, in an official statement on Thursday, said as a standard operating procedure, the police monitored all possible volatile events.\n\n\"In this case, planning was done and we were in a state of readiness as the police are mandated to maintain law and order.\"\n\nThe statement said it was the prerogative of the organisers to call off any event they deemed to be volatile.\n\n\"We did not recommend or advise any organiser to cancel or postpone any such meeting as it is their prerogative.\"", "description": "Opposition parties looking to remove Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Mongameli Bobani attempted for two hours to force through a cancelled council sitting, where a motion of no confidence in the mayor was meant to be held.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8712/ad471776fabc4a0b8b88eff41ae4bee5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
