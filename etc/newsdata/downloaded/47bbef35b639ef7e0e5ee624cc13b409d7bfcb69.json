The problem that Warren faces\u2014the reason moderators and rivals will keep pressing this question\u2014is that, for whatever reason, she wants to skip over the explanation. This is a puzzlement, given that Warren has an inordinate amount of experience offering sound personal financial advice. There\u2019s not much more to be done once the matter is explained through the lens of a household budget. Maddeningly, in this instance, she wants to attest to solving the Medicare for All equation without showing the work. In so doing, she forces voters to fill in these gaps for themselves.\n\n\n\nWarren is also missing a golden opportunity to make an important point about the various costs that the health care industry imposes on the middle class. These costs are taxes, broadly defined. They may not be the literal taxation that the Internal Revenue Service levies on an annual basis, but this is a distinction without a difference. Just as American society imposes a series of taxes to build a world of public goods and services\u2014from roads to schools to an unbridled war machine that operates without any accountability\u2014the health care industry makes similar extractions as individuals travel its labyrinthine architecture.\n\n\n\nThis is not some trick of rhetorical prestidigitation or a leap of logic. Many Americans pay for their insurance in the form of a deduction from their paycheck; it\u2019s right on their pay stubs, alongside the deductions made for federal and state withholdings and FICA. The Affordable Care Act, as it was originally conceived, was also founded on the notion that health care expenses are taxes: Americans who were required to obtain insurance on health-care exchanges either paid an insurance premium or sent an additional chunk of money to the IRS. This is not difficult to explain to voters. To the extent that there are people who don\u2019t currently conflate the health care industry\u2019s predations as a type of taxation, there is a big \u201cEureka!\u201d moment to be had, to which Warren could point the way.\n\n\n\nWhy Warren doesn\u2019t do so is a mystery. Perhaps she\u2019s anxious that her primary opponents\u2014or President Donald Trump\u2014will feature her in a campaign ad saying that taxes will go up on the middle class. Avoiding such a prospect would be a thin victory. Some of her Democratic opponents have already proven willing to mischaracterize Medicare for All as a plan to throw millions of people off their private insurance. Trump is going to spin bigger and gaudier lies about Warren than her position on health care. Besides, Sanders has already given away the game\u2014so why not just admit that middle class taxes will increase under Medicare for All, and explain why this doesn\u2019t mean their overall household costs will go up?\n\n\n\nThat Sanders is the mastermind behind the Medicare for All bill may go farther in explaining Warren\u2019s reluctance to provide a more compelling answer. When she has the opportunity to defend her own plans, she does so with the firmness and specificity she\u2019s eschewed in the Medicare for All debate. (Her defense of her wealth tax provides a good contrast.) But Warren doesn\u2019t really have her own health care plan. She has piggybacked onto Sanders\u2019s plan, but done so without fully embracing its implications. Instead, she has hemmed and hawed. She seems to want all of the political simplicity of Medicare for All without owning any of the risk of it.\n\n", "description": "It's a mystery why the Massachusetts senator won't plainly state the truth about single-payer health care.", "authors": ["Jason Linkins"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/55d22438e59752fd229ec9b1c14259ceb6715f0a.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
