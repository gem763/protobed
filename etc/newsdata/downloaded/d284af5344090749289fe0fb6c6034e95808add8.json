But according to FiveThirtyEight, her propensity to support the president\u2019s preferred policies has drastically declined since she moved to the upper chamber. Thus far this Congress, Sinema has voted with Trump just 19 percent of the time, after having done so more than 62 percent of the time as a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition in the House.\n\nThe anti-Sinema resolution that the Arizona progressive caucus floated took particular issue with her votes in favor of two Trump nominees: William Barr to serve as attorney general and David Bernhardt to serve as secretary of the interior. It also castigated Sinema for being the sole Democratic senator not to sponsor the Save the Internet Act, which would\u2019ve reinstated net-neutrality rules rolled back by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nLuckily for Sinema, she has managed to avoid any formal censure, at least for now. At a meeting of the state Democratic party over the weekend, the party\u2019s Resolutions Committee voted unanimously to table the progressive caucus\u2019s resolution, though the caucus has left open the possibility of mounting another push for it early next year.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alexandra Desanctis", "Nationalreview.Com Kyrsten-Sinema-Escapes-Progressive-Censure"], "top_image": ""}
