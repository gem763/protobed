Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees are looking into whether Trump abused his powers by withholding $250 million in military aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son that would benefit the president politically.\n\nThe chants against the president harked back to campaign rallies in 2016 during which fans of Trump would often break into chants of \"Lock her up!\" in reference to Hillary Clinton.", "description": "The president, who was there with first lady Melania Trump, stood smiling and clapping throughout.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4262634/1000x563_nbc-191027-trump-nationals-game-rd-1008p_2c5f97060a52f6d6b0d3ef35312b8f7a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
