We\u2019re improving and we\u2019re learning,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that will hear from Muilenburg on Wednesday, said in a written statement for the hearing that the panel was aware of \u201cat least one case where a Boeing manager implored the then-Vice President and General Manager of the 737 program to shut down the 737 MAX production line because of safety concerns, several months before the Lion Air crash in October 2018.\u201d\n\nBoeing did not immediately comment.\n\n\u201cSomething went drastically wrong, a total of 346 people died, and we have a duty to fix it,\u201d DeFazio added.\n\nSenator Jon Tester noted Boeing had won approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to avoid having to add new crew alerts because it would have been expensive. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened if FAA would have been doing their job and it also wouldn\u2019t have happened if you had known what the hell was going on,\u201d he said.\n\nTester, a Montana senator, said widescale changes were needed. \u201cI would walk before I would get on a 737 MAX. I would walk. There is no way ... You shouldn\u2019t be cutting corners and I see corners being cut.\u201d\n\nTaking turns to grill Muilenburg during his first appearance at a hearing on Capitol Hill in the year since the first crash in Indonesia, senators suggested Boeing had not been completely honest and expressed dismay that the 2016 instant messages did not prompt an immediate reaction from the company.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz said he could not understand why the messages did not prompt an immediate response from Boeing senior management, saying the exchange about the problems \u201cdescribes what happened in Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines.\u201d\n\nHe questioned why Muilenburg did not read the messages earlier.\n\n\u201cHow did your team not put in front of you, run in with their hair on fire saying \u2018we have a real problem here\u2019?\u201d Cruz said, asking why the messages did not prompt a \u201cnine-alarm fire.\u201d\n\nFor months, Boeing had largely failed to acknowledge blame, instead vowing to make a \u201csafe plane safer.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s hearing represents Boeing\u2019s broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes but Muilenburg stopped short of what some lawmakers and family members had sought.\n\nDespite the tough questions, Boeing shares ended 2.4% higher at $348.93 on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, questioned Muilenburg over the company\u2019s delay in releasing the IMs in which a former test pilot described erratic behavior of a simulator version of the MCAS software and also mentioned \u201cJedi-mind tricking\u201d regulators over training requirements.\n\nWicker said those messages revealed a \u201cdisturbing level of casualness and flippancy.\u201d\n\nThe FAA is demanding significant new safeguards to MCAS before the plane can fly again.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg arrives to testify before a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing on \u201caviation safety\u201d and the grounded 737 MAX after two deadly 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nFLYING COFFINS\n\nIn his opening remarks, Muilenburg walked the committee through software upgrades to limit the authority of the stall-prevention system that has been linked to both crashes. He also listed changes at the company and its board of directors to improve safety oversight and transparency.\n\nDuring one particularly tense exchange, Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington questioned Muilenburg and Vice President for Boeing Commercial Airplanes John Hamilton over the extent of testing on MCAS. Cantwell asked Hamilton whether it was a mistake for Boeing not to test a failure mode similar to the scenarios faced by pilots in the crashes.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, senator, yes,\u201d Hamilton said. Both he and Muilenburg, however, pointed to extensive testing by engineers and pilots during the certification process that lasted years.\n\nMuilenburg also acknowledged a \u201cmistake on that implementation\u201d for failing to tell the FAA for 13 months that it inadvertently made a so-called angle of attack disagree alert optional on the 737 MAX, instead of standard as on earlier 737s. The company insisted the missing display represented no safety risk.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve learned ... is we need to provide additional information on MCAS to pilots,\u201d Muilenburg said.\n\nAt one point, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut referred to the 737 MAX as \u201cflying coffins.\u201d\n\nAsked ahead of the hearing if he would resign, Muilenburg said that was \u201cnot where my focus is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese two accidents occurred on my watch and I have a keen sense of responsibility,\u201d said Muilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board earlier this month.\n\nFamily members, holding photos of victims of the crash, were seated just three rows behind Muilenburg during his testimony.\n\nJustin Green, co-chair of the Ethiopian Airlines plaintiffs\u2019 committee, said, \u201cMr. Muilenburg has been apologetic in his testimony, but it is more important to my clients that Boeing do the right things than for it to say the right things.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nIndonesian investigators reported Friday that Boeing, acting without adequate oversight from U.S. regulators, failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on the 737 MAX, sowing the seeds for the Oct. 29, 2018, crash of Lion Air Flight 610.\n\nOn Tuesday, Muilenburg denied Boeing\u2019s initial statements about the investigative findings from the Lion Air crash sought to shift blame onto pilots.\n\nMuilenburg was then asked why Boeing had not grounded the plane in the wake of Lion Air Crash. \u201cIf we could go back, we would make a different decision,\u201d he said.", "description": "Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg faced intense grilling by U.S. lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday over what the company knew about its MCAS stall-prevention system linked to two deadly crashes, and about delays in turning over internal 2016 messages that described erratic behavior of the software in a simulator.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446413946&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S16P", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
