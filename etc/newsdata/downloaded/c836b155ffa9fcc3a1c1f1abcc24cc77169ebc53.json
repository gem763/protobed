Reuters/Andrew Boyers/File Photo\n\nSouth Africa suffered their heaviest loss to India in the second test, going down by an innings and 137 runs in Pune last weekend.\n\nThey were also clobbered in the first test at Visakhapatnam by 203 runs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to understand that we have to fight our way out of these last two losses,\u201d Du Plessis told a news conference on the eve of the first day.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t expect things just to happen. They won\u2019t happen, because India is a very powerful team at the moment. Their record at home is amazing.\n\n\u201cSo for us, it\u2019s just about trying to keep doing the things well, keep practising hard, keep doing the processes as well as you can, and then hopefully it\u2019s just a matter of time and you start winning again.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa, who host England in December and January, have lost their last four tests \u2013 two at home to Sri Lanka in February and the first two of the tour to India.\n\n\u201cIt is tough. It is tough when you\u2019re losing,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cFor us, we\u2019re very, very competitive people, so it does take a dent out of your confidence, but international sport is supposed to be hard, and the guys who have stayed at the top for a long time will tell you that it comes with ups and it comes with downs, personally and from a team point of view.\u201d\n\nCricket South Africa\u2019s top officials have been blaming the retirement of the likes of AB de Villiers, Hashim Amla and Dale Steyn for the slump.\n\nTOUGH DESTINATION\n\nBut when they were at their peak, India also proved a tough destination for the South Africans, added Du Plessis.\n\n\u201cWe came here last time with a very experienced international team that did very well overseas, the best record abroad, and we still found it challenging,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an obvious reason that people who come to India find it tough to beat them at home.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for me in that aspect. It\u2019s about trying to improve as players.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of young guys in the team, and they need to make sure that whatever they get out of this experience, when they come back in three or four years\u2019 time, they\u2019re better and stronger for it.\u201d", "description": "South Africa captain Faf du Plessis is hoping for a fighting reaction from his beleaguered team as they go into the final test against India at Ranchi on Saturday seeking to avoid a series whitewash.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442253263&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0XK-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
