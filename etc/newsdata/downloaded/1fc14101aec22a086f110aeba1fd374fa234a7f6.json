The executive gets rebirth and the energy that comes with a new challenge; the organization gets a fresh perspective, and the chance for true change that comes with new leadership. This idea resonated with me.\u201d\n\nThough he hasn\u2019t quite hit the decade mark in Chicago, Epstein is closing in on it. Also, the circumstances in Chicago are similar to what they were when he jumped ship in Boston, as the team, losers of seven in row as of this writing, is about to blow a shot at the playoffs, and manager Joe Maddon is almost certain to be fired.\n\nAlso, as Speier points out, one of the big reasons Epstein left Boston was his strained relationship with former team CEO/president Larry Lucchino. His successor, Sam Kennedy, went to Brookline High with Epstein and the two are close.\n\n\u201cMight the team once again flip on a bat signal for Epstein, either by pursuing him directly or hiring someone who was close to him? And if so, would he be interested in responding?\u201d Speier writes. \u201cWould the Cubs permit him to do so? These are just a few of the many questions associated with the Red Sox opening, where silence has created a void filled not by information or a known candidate list but instead by conjecture.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at the Boston Globe", "description": "Epstein was able to bring the Cubs their first World Series in more than a 100 years and may be willing to move on from Chicago for a new challenge.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1144265448-1-e1569441293213.jpg?fit=798%2C532", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
