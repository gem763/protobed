However, according to the statement, they determined the theater could safely reopen Friday.\n\nAn employee at the movie theater told ABC News that \u201cJoker\u201d screenings were running as planned Friday.\n\nThe film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, faced backlash from parents of the Aurora shooting victims. The parents, who wrote a letter to Warner Bros., called for the company to support gun reform in light of releasing \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\n\"If you're going to make a movie with such violence, at least be donating to those of us who are trying to stop the violence and survivors who have been affected by gun violence,\" Sandy Phillips, who lost her daughter Jessica Redfield Ghawi in the shooting and was one of the five people who signed the letter, previously told ABC News.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nIn 2012, 12 people were killed at a screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d which featured the Joker character played by the late Heath Ledger.\n\n\"Of course it reminded me of our shooting, which happened at a Batman movie,\" Phillips said. \"I thought, 'How many people are going to be triggered by this movie?'\"\n\nThe FBI said it was aware of and monitoring threatening posts on social media calling for \"unspecific mass shootings\" linked to the release of the film.\n\nPolice in major U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, said extra officers would be at movie theaters where \u201cJoker\u201d is playing.\n\nPhoenix, in an interview on \"Popcorn with Peter Travers,\" said he did not believe \"movies influence people in that way.\"\n\n\u201cI don't think they cause homicidal ideation, the creation of homicidal thoughts. I don't think that's the case,\" Phoenix said on Thursday. \"But the conversation around them, I think, can be dangerous.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, \u201cJoker\u201d broke records at the box office. The film brought in $13.3 million for its Thursday night preview, beating out the previous record of $10 million brought in by \u201cVenom\u201d last year.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d opened to 4,374 theaters in the U.S. Friday.", "description": "A threat over", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/joker-joaquin-phoenix-ht-ml-190403_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
