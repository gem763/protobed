Pearl was reportedly on his way to an interview in Karachi, Pakistan for a story about the \u201cshoe bomber,\u201d Richard Reid, when he was kidnapped on January 23, 2002. Investigators say he was led into a trap, believing he was to meet with Sheikh Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani. His captors demanded better conditions for prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay and threatened to kill Pearl if the demands weren\u2019t met. Pearl was killed sometime between the end of January and early February, though the US government only confirmed Pearl\u2019s beheading on February 21, 2002. Four men were convicted in the case. Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British-born Islamic militant, was sentenced to death, while the other three were given life terms. In 2016, the Pakistani military thwarted a plot to free Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, as suspected mastermind of the 9/11 attacks being held by the United States, has said he personally killed Pearl.", "description": "", "authors": ["Yaffa Fredrick", "Annie Cohen"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2017/images/11/14/free-press-journalists-killed_social.jpg"}
