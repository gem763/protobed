I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll spend \u00a380m on Declan Rice, that\u2019s for sure, at this moment in time,\u2019 he told TalkSport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve got to remember he was a centre-half and as a midfield player, I\u2019ve watched quite a lot of him this year, he\u2019s still got a long way to go.\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s at the right club at West Ham, he\u2019s playing week in, week out, which is important, and I think he\u2019s got the right people around him, like Mark Noble, who has been there a long time, so he\u2019ll learn a lot.\n\n\u2018But stop quoting these ridiculous prices, it\u2019s madness, it really is. In two or three years time, maybe, but he\u2019s still got a lot to learn, he\u2019s still got to grow, be a lot more powerful and get up and down the park quicker than he does.\n\n\u2018That will come as his body develops more but he\u2019s still got to get himself in the box, got to score goals. That\u2019s going to be worth \u00a380-90m, so if he can learn that as he grows older, why not?\u2019\n\nUnited have embarked on a home-grown transfer policy during Solskjaer\u2019s time in charge evidenced by their signings of Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James in the summer.\n\nAs well as Rice, United have also been linked with Leicester duo James Maddison and Ben Chilwell, Newcastle\u2019s Sean Longstaff and Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Paul Ince believes West Ham's \u00a380m valuation of midfielder Declan Rice is 'ridiculous' amid rumours linking him with a move to Manchester United.
