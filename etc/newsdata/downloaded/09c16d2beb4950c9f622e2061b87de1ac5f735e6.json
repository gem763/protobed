Whether it is political pettiness, shortsightedness or just plain jealousy, I couldn\u2019t tell you.\n\nI can tell you that it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s un-American. And it\u2019s an affront to long-standing conservative principles.\n\nTo understand why I\u2019m so angry about the administration\u2019s move to revoke California\u2019s waiver to regulate automobile emissions, you must understand the history. In 1967, Reagan established the California Air Resources Board to fight crippling pollution. He appointed as its first director not a political hack or lobbyist, but a scientist, Arie Jan Haagen-Smit, who was a pioneering researcher of the causes and impacts of smog. The 1970 Clean Air Act, signed by another California Republican, President Richard M. \u00adNixon, gave California the authority to regulate air pollution \u2014 and ever since, we have had what is called a waiver from the federal government to set car pollution limits.\n\nHistorically, it worked well. We set our standards, and the federal government didn\u2019t just respect our authority, it generally made our rules the standard for the entire nation. During my time as governor, we had some hiccups with George W. Bush administration officials. They told us greenhouse gases were not a pollutant, and we won in the Supreme Court (duh). Then they didn\u2019t approve our clean air waiver, but that ended when President Barack Obama took office and made a compromise version of our state standard the national standard.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s threat to revoke our waiver to clean our air is more extreme. And coming from a Republican White House, it\u2019s downright hypocritical.\n\nHow many times have you heard conservatives beat the drum of states\u2019 rights? But suddenly, when a state wants to pollute less and protect its citizens from deadly pollution, conservatives throw states\u2019 rights straight out the window. Nixon and Reagan understood the importance of California\u2019s right to clean air, but some so-called Republicans today seem to only believe in states\u2019 rights when it\u2019s convenient, when the state voted for their party, or when the state is doing something really dumb.\n\nHow many times have you heard Republicans talk about being pro-business? But now, when automakers plead with the administration that they don\u2019t want the Stone Age standards the White House is fighting for, some Republicans aren\u2019t acting very pro-business. This administration is even taking the extraordinary step of investigating four companies \u2014 Ford, Honda, BMW and Volkswagen \u2014 that made an agreement with California to reduce their emissions. That agreement is another compromise, because California isn\u2019t anti-business. And I guarantee you that more big carmakers will be joining those forward-thinking companies.\n\nHow many times have you heard Republicans talk about security and public safety? When Americans are attacked or bridges collapse, we demand action. We know pollution sickens and kills hundreds of thousands; the administration\u2019s own EPA says lowering the automobile standard will literally kill more people. But suddenly public safety doesn\u2019t matter much anymore.\n\nSo why is revoking California\u2019s waiver even being discussed?\n\nI\u2019m sure the EPA and the White House will continue to say this dumb policy decision is all about stopping regulations that \u201ccripple the economy.\u201d\n\nThey should come out to California. Last year, the U.S. economy grew by 2.9 percent . California\u2019s economy, with our supposedly crippling regulations, grew by 3.5 percent . We\u2019ve outpaced the nation\u2019s economic growth even as we\u2019ve protected our people.\n\nOur success is built on our consistency. Ever since Reagan, each governor has continued the legacy of moving toward a clean energy future. We don\u2019t play the games Washington does, with each administration changing the trajectory of the United States and forcing businesses to guess about where we are headed.\n\nThat\u2019s a big reason nearly half of the venture capital in the United States comes to California. Businesses aren\u2019t just thinking about their talking points for their next campaign. They\u2019re planning for five years, 10 years, 20 years. Businesses must have long-term vision to succeed.\n\nKnee-jerk reactionary policies such as the move to revoke our clean air waiver create uncertainty. These companies have been planning and working toward cleaner cars for a decade. They didn\u2019t ask for the Trump administration\u2019s backward thinking, and they know it won\u2019t help them. This \u201csolution\u201d in search of a problem reminds me of the nine words that most terrified Reagan: \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\n\nBusiness leaders \u2014 and Californians \u2014 know that you can\u2019t just erase decades of history and progress by drawing a line through it with a Sharpie. It\u2019s time the administration learns that lesson.\n\nCalifornia will fight this decision. And I promise you, we will win.", "description": "Ever since Ronald Reagan, each California governor has continued the legacy of moving toward a clean energy future.", "authors": ["Arnold Schwarzenegger", "September At Pm", "Arnold Schwarzenegger Is A Former Governor Of California."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1MnXmclqWOBh3mDGMf4jcItz1Bs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PQMJQ2GSNMI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
