It\u2019s still too early to know if the accusations will gain traction. Attention is more focused on a president facing a looming impeachment than Biden. His Democratic rivals have also sidestepped the issue, or expressed their support for the former vice president in the face of Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims.\n\nAnd Biden also appears to be more trusted by voters overall than Trump. An SSRS survey conducted for the Washington Post and released Tuesday reported that 60 percent believe Trump does not uphold adequate ethical standards while only 35 percent believe he does. In contrast, 47 percent believe Biden does uphold adequate ethical standards while 38 percent believe he does not.\n\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday found that 53 percent believe Trump has not been honest and truthful in the Ukraine affair, while 38 percent believe he has.\n\n\u201cAmericans filter these things through the messenger, the credibility of the messenger, and Trump is clearly lacking credibility,\u201d said John Anzalone, Biden\u2019s chief pollster.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on Biden \u2014 in public comments and on Twitter \u2014 have shown no signs of abating ever since the Ukraine news began to hit a major saturation point on Sept. 20 amid news the president was accused of improperly leveraging U.S. aid to the foreign government in return for it investigating the Bidens.\n\nThat news broke at a time when Biden\u2019s poll numbers were sliding as Elizabeth Warren was starting to overtake him in some polls. Warren continues to lead Biden in some national polls, including the Quinnipiac survey.\n\nBut since Trump began ramping up his criticism of Biden \u2014 and since more news reports have surfaced revealing White House involvement in an effort to persuade Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son \u2014 the former vice president has held his own for the most part.\n\nA Fox News poll in Wisconsin last week put Biden at 28 percent among Democratic primary voters \u2014 exactly what he had there in a Marquette University poll at the end of August.\n\nThe most recent Fox News poll in Biden\u2019s South Carolina firewall , shows he has increased his support there 6 points since July and now tops the Democratic field with 41 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cOn a state level, it\u2019s been a net plus over the last week. It helps further energize the volunteer base, it\u2019s had a rallying around effect,\u201d said Pete Kavanaugh, deputy campaign manager in charge of states for the Biden campaign. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ve seen a pretty significant uptick on what we\u2019re able to do on the ground.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/ba/74/60638b03496daba7067fc8fbe9a4/artboard-1.png\"\n\nAnother adviser with the Biden campaign noted that non-stop coverage on cable networks has only given Biden loads of earned media attention while other competitors are either shut out from coverage or they\u2019re trying to get a piece of the story by taking a stronger stance on impeachment or in defense of Biden.\n\nWhile polling data suggests Biden remains largely untouched by Trump\u2019s attacks among Democratic voters, the evidence is less clear among the general electorate. While Biden has led Trump in virtually every head-to-head match-up this year, his advantage over Trump has declined in at least one recent national poll.\n\nBiden leads Trump by 9 points in Tuesday\u2019s Quinnipiac survey \u2014 but that\u2019s down from a 16-point edge in Quinnipiac\u2019s late August survey.\n\nPolls aside, at least one Biden donor says Trump\u2019s focus on the former vice president is having a catalytic effect, at least for now, on Biden\u2019s fundraising \u2014 which lagged behind his top-tier rivals in the recently-ended third quarter.\n\nJoe Cotchett, a Bay Area donor who helped coordinate a Palo Alto fundraiser last week, said he had initially booked an intimate event for several dozen people. Once Ukraine started ramping up, he said his phone started ringing and ringing with more interest. The event, where tickets ranged from $1,500 to $10,000, ended up drawing close to 100 people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so much interest in Joe,\u201d Cotchett said. \u201cTrump is getting his name out there every time he tweets. The theory is he\u2019s the guy that Trump is worried about.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/19/52/c5fa960f4908869a053ecf187a6e/20191008-joe-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
