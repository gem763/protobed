In fact, Ineos hasn't even submitted a request to the IAAF for the attempt to be officially ratified.\n\nKipchoge was assisted by an army of 30 pacemakers. A pace car emitted a green laser to help keep time.\n\nDuring the race, Kipchoge followed behind a car -- a condition not allowed under IAAF sanctions -- and was assisted by an army of 30 pacemakers.\n\nKenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta congratulated Kipchoge in a tweet after the marathon: \"You've done it, you've made history and made Kenya proud while at it.\n\n\"Your win today, will inspire tens of future generations to dream big and to aspire for greatness,\" Kenyatta added.\n\n\"Hearty congratulations @EliudKipchoge. You've done it, you've made history and made Kenya proud while at it. Your win today, will inspire tens of future generations to dream big and to aspire for greatness. We celebrate you and wish you God's blessings.\" - President Kenyatta \u2014 State House Kenya (@StateHouseKenya) October 12, 2019\n\nSpeaking before the marathon, Kipchoge said he was aware that there were critics of the manufactured conditions surrounding the attempt.\n\n\"The law of nature cannot allow all human beings to think together,\" the reigning Olympic marathon champion said. \"In breaking the two-hour barrier, I want to open minds to think that no human is limited. All our minds, all our thoughts are parallel. But I respect everybody's thoughts.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old said the challenge was different to competing in a race like the Berlin Marathon.\n\nHe added that the 1:59 Challenge is different to competing in a race like the Berlin Marathon, where he set the current world record in 2018.\n\n\"Berlin is running and breaking a world record,\" said Kipchoge. \"Vienna is running and making history -- like the first man to go to the moon.\"", "description": "Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge has successfully completed the first ever marathon under two hours in the Austrian capital of Vienna, two years since he fell 25 seconds short.", "authors": ["Bianca Britton"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191012090916-02-eliud-kipchoge-marathon-attempt-1012-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
