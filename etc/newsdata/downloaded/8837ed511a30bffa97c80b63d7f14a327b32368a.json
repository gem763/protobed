This week, we\u2019re featuring vocalist, producer, filmmaker, and professional scooter rider Oliver Tree.\n\nWhen Oliver Tree walks into The Verge office, everyone snaps their head. It\u2019s impossible to not notice his ostentatious presence: massively wide JNCO pants, a violet and fuchsia \u201990s ski jacket, Gucci suitcase, and... a bowl haircut. Oh, and he\u2019s got a Razor scooter with him too. It\u2019s not unfair to say that Oliver Tree is a walking, talking meme. The visual schtick, along with accompanying deadpan humor persona, were deliberately crafted by Oliver Tree to appeal to a meme-friendly generation. And through that lens he serves up catchy, hip-hop infused pop with an electronic kick. Come for the memes, stay for the music.\n\nThis combination has been integral to Oliver Tree\u2019s success. His single \u201cWhen I\u2019m Down\u201d went viral in 2017, racking up tens of millions of plays online. He replicated the formula for \u201cAlien Boy\u201d and again with \u201cHurt,\u201d nailing down a very specific vision that\u2019s designed to cater to people\u2019s eyes and ears. \u201cHurt\u201d in particular was a flag plant for Oliver Tree\u2019s ability to create infectious melodies \u2014 the song spent 16 weeks on Billboard\u2019s Hot Rock Songs chart, peaking at position 12. Now, he\u2019s released another new single, called \u201cFuck,\u201d and is preparing for his full-length debut, which will be released this year. In the meantime, Oliver Tree treats us to a peek inside his world, which includes lots of scooter stories, a busted iPhone, and mountains of Cheetos.\n\nFirst of all I really need to know about your pants because I had JNCO pants and you don\u2019t see them very often.\n\nThese are JNCOs that are no longer for sale. JNCO shut down last year, but I was able to pick these pants up through a buddy who lives north of the Rockies, this guy Little Ricky. He\u2019s a JNCO dealer and he has a warehouse with 300 pairs of JNCOs. He basically has every type ever made: khaki JNCOs, short JNCOs, leopard JNCOs, he has it all.\n\nTo be honest I was surprised that they lasted so long.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of the end of an era.\n\nTell me about your style.\n\nThis outfit is made up from everything I really thought was cool as a child. So these were the pants I always wanted. These are the sunglasses I used to wear. This is the haircut I\u2019ve had my entire life. I was too scared to get any other type of haircut. My mom picked it for me. The jacket I stole from my mom, but she wasn\u2019t really using it so I don\u2019t think she misses it too much. And then socks and sandals is just my favorite footwear combo.\n\nWho do you think has the best style right now?\n\nMy biggest fashion inspiration is Lloyd Christmas from Dumb and Dumber. Solid. Him and my parents. My parents showed me how to really unharness my swagger.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to your bag.\n\nThis basically has my raw essentials. I take this everywhere I go. It\u2019s a fake Gucci bag I got in China in the underground market. Well, I guess I should just show you.\n\nYeah! Let\u2019s get into it. Your suitcase is filled with Cheetos?\n\nI\u2019m traveling a lot, so one of the main things I need is a source of energy. There\u2019s not many great food options on the road. So I just bring my main food with me everywhere and my main energy source.\n\nDo you have any favorite flavor?\n\nTraditional hot. You can have one too. My treat. I\u2019ve got plenty. I bring them to share.\n\nHow many Cheetos is a meal?\n\nWell it depends if it\u2019s the big bag or a little bag. If it\u2019s a little bag I can do about 13, and if it\u2019s a big bag I only need two. I also have one liter of Mountain Dew here.\n\nSo what if someone offers you a salad?\n\nSometimes I\u2019m feeling healthy and I\u2019ll take a salad and crumple up a couple of Cheetos on there. Usually I say flat out no though.\n\nI can\u2019t think of a more perfect substitute for any type of food. It\u2019s perfect on any occasion for a meal. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I\u2019m an intense energy person and these things really keep me on the edge. They keep me going and keep my chi really high. It\u2019s basically the ultimate snack.\n\nAnd then I have a portrait I painted of myself. I keep that with me just in case I ever lose touch with who I really am.\n\nIf you forget your passport just show that.\n\nI pretty much use this as a legal form of identification.\n\nNot a lot of people know this but I\u2019m big into watercolors and pastels. I think this thing took me about a month to make. And I don\u2019t have a house so I bring it everywhere.\n\nThe eyes are really intense.\n\nThat was based off of the music video where I died, and this is the white-eyed version of it. That\u2019s my understanding. When I painted it though I was a bit drunk so I can\u2019t remember. It\u2019s an emotional piece and every time I look at it I just see so much of myself.\n\nThat\u2019s from a newer music video, right?\n\nThe record is called \u201cHurt.\u201d It\u2019s a song I made about a scooter accident I had when I was 18. It was a semifinal run at a pro competition. I\u2019m in this 20-foot roll in and out of nowhere this little pebble shows up. I hit this thing and just go flying \u2014 break my left wrist, break my right wrist, and break the joint that connects the thumb to the hand. At that point I had to start considering other career options because scootering was just not safe. I needed something that had a little bit more longevity for a career choice. So I started making a segue out of the professional scooter world and focused on this Oliver Tree project.\n\nWe went to Ukraine to film the music video for \u201cHurt,\u201d and made that with a small loan of a million dollars. Atlantic Records supported us. I want to shout out Craig Kallman and Julie Greenwald - they were really the people who helped finance this and bring it to life. It took us two years to sort out the financial side, and I don\u2019t think we could really be happier with the outcome.\n\nWhat phone do you use?\n\nThis is an iPhone X. Let me turn it over because it\u2019s busted and that\u2019s even funnier. I was in Madrid, out clubbing and blogging and it fell off the stick. And I have a Juul. Strictly marijuana. There\u2019s no tobacco in that.\n\nHow did you get the Solo cup design put on your clothing and the monster truck for \u201cAll That\u201d?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, it was hell. And we\u2019ve been asked to not use the logo anymore. We couldn\u2019t use it in other videos. The whole coffin scene in \u201cHurt\u201d was supposed to be Solo cup, but they were not too thrilled with the idea. After the last video they just said, \u201cPlease never use our stuff again.\u201d But we don\u2019t care because I already got to use it in the first video.\n\nThe original designer is a woman who basically got ripped off by the company. She worked for the distributor and submitted it for a company contest, but didn\u2019t get any of the royalties from it. It ended up becoming a phenomenon, but they owned her design at that point. Her name is Gina Ekiss.\n\nAre there other wheeled activities that you\u2019re into?\n\nI\u2019m really big into scooters and electric scooters. I\u2019ve got like, 13 pocket rockets. I drive monster trucks. I actually spent five months training for my first music video learning how to jump monster trucks. This guy only let one other person drive his monster truck, which was Jay Leno, so I\u2019m very honored that he trusted me. It\u2019s in the first music video for \u201cAlien Boy.\u201d\n\nI was surprised that the guy would let me borrow this truck because these trucks are like, half a million dollars. It\u2019s a huge liability. You have to be properly trained by a professional.\n\nDo you record on the road?\n\nWe\u2019re making films on the road. We\u2019re working on a documentary. We\u2019re doing half hour, 45-minute films on the trials and tribulations of what a starting out project looks like in all reality. The drama, the violence, the frustration, the suffering. We cover it all. We have already put on a couple videos. We did a behind the scenes for \u201cHurt.\u201d It\u2019s how to make a million-dollar music video.\n\nWhat\u2019s your songwriting process?\n\nI don\u2019t do any songwriting on the road because I\u2019ll go live life for three months, and then I\u2019ll go write music for two months straight and write every single story I have to tell. Once I get burnt out on it and start making the same songs, I go back on the road and experience life. If you don\u2019t live enough experiences you have a limited spectrum of things you can write about, so it fuels the fire.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of hats artists have to wear nowadays. If you wear the same hat every day it gets really old. So it\u2019s refreshing to be able to have it broken up into different parts of the year: This month we film, this month we tour, this month we make music.\n\nI produce and write music with other producers, but with vocals I\u2019m essentially improvising all of that, besides maybe a song or two here and there. I freestyle and see what comes out. If it doesn\u2019t make total sense but I like the idea I\u2019ll carve out and chop up all these little parts together and then I\u2019ll rewrite lyrics to it. I would say about 85 percent of the lyrics are improvised.\n\nSo backing up to the bag...\n\nCouldn\u2019t afford the real one. I had a friend who told me about this market and was like, \u201cYou gotta go here, this is the best underground market in Shanghai.\u201d So I went to check it out. It\u2019s illegal to sell Gucci there because there\u2019s actual Gucci stores. It\u2019s really hush hush. They can sell all these other items like Supreme, because there\u2019s no Supreme dealers there. But there\u2019s tons of Gucci stores.\n\nBecause it\u2019s sketchy for them you have to ask for Gucci and they\u2019ll pull you to these back rooms, or take you to a whole different store a block away and into a little room covered in fake bags. Then they ask you to pay ridiculous prices for it, thinking you think it\u2019s real, but all you have to do is negotiate. They really want to make a sale so they\u2019re prepared to negotiate pretty heavily. I was able to negotiate a couple bags and this was the the real pride and joy and what I decided to take on the road with me.\n\nThe real reason I\u2019m buying the fake stuff is because I love the idea that people think it\u2019s so cool and it\u2019s a $2 item. That\u2019s why I bought tons of fake pairs of Yeezys. I would tell people that they\u2019re fake and my fans thought it was hilarious. People like Yeezy Buster would try calling me out, saying, \u201cThis guy\u2019s got fake shoes!\u201d I loved it.\n\nPhotography by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge", "description": "Oliver Tree is a walking, talking meme.
