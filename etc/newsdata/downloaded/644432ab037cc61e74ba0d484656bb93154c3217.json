(Kin Cheung/AP)\n\nHong Kong protesters on Sunday shifted their focus back to the city\u2019s airport, hindering access to one of the world\u2019s busiest international transit hubs, prompting clashes with police, transportation snarls and confusion.\n\nTheir action, a \u201cstress test\u201d to force the government to respond to their demands after months of sustained demonstrations, caused airlines to delay and cancel flights and left passengers with few ways to get to the airport. Many got off at nearby bus terminals and just walked.\n\nOrganizers said they hoped to hold similar actions every weekend if the government does not give in to their demands.\n\n\u201cThe airport is vital to the economy of Hong Kong,\u201d one of the organizers of Sunday\u2019s action told reporters over the Telegram secure messaging app. \u201cThe most impactful way to express our five demands is to go to the airport.\u201d\n\nBy the afternoon, an express train connecting the city to Hong Kong International Airport was suspended \u2014 first because of a decision from authorities and later because demonstrators had flung objects on the track. Protesters began marching to a subway stop close to the airport, blocking a major access road.\n\nKiko Escuadro, a 27-year-old tourist heading back to Manila, said the closures forced him to walk an hour and a half from a train station to the airport.\n\nHe did not mind the inconvenience, however, and made his flight.\n\n\u201cI understand what they are fighting for,\u201d Escuadro said. \u201cThey are young people fighting for their future.\u201d\n\nThe rallies followed intense clashes between protesters and police in Hong Kong on Saturday, a day that ended with fear and violence at subway stops when riot police stormed trains filled with commuters going about their evening, swinging batons and making arrests.\n\nOn Sunday, police were waiting at the piers for ferries from Lantau Island, where the airport is located. They stopped and searched those who got off the boats, collected bags of evidence and wrote down identification numbers.\n\nWith other public transportation largely shut down, hundreds walked along the highway for hours across Lantau Island back toward Hong Kong Island.\n\nEventually, they were met at a toll plaza by dozens of volunteer drivers who answered calls put out on Telegram using the hashtag #backhome to assist demonstrators. Drivers filled their cars to shuttle protesters away; other demonstrators boarded double-decker buses.\n\n\n\nProtesters set fire to barricades at Tung Chung, near the airport. (Vincent Yu/AP)\n\nAfter 13 straight weekends of protest, the rupture between Hong Kong police and civilians appears to be solidifying, with no end to the crisis in sight. The government refuses to make concessions, and protesters have been undeterred by mass arrests and police use of force.\n\n[With Hong Kong in turmoil, questions grow over leader\u2019s refusal to offer concessions to protesters]\n\nHong Kong International Airport, a major Asian hub ranked among the world\u2019s most efficient, has been the focus of previous demonstrations. Protests against a proposed law to allow extraditions to mainland China have attracted widespread support across the semiautonomous Chinese territory. Since returning to mainland control in 1997, Hong Kong has fought to protect its democratic freedoms and unique culture.\n\nA demonstration at the airport last month turned ugly as protesters held two Chinese men \u2014 one a reporter for the Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper \u2014 and blocked passengers from boarding their flights.\n\nA court injunction has banned further gatherings at the airport, so protesters on Sunday focused their action on a bus stop outside the terminal and on roads around the airport. Terminals were heavily fortified by police, who were letting in only travelers with boarding passes.\n\nHong Kong police marching through the airport Sunday afternoon were met with boos and jeers. Relations between the force and most city residents appear to be at an all-time low, as officers are perceived to be doing Beijing\u2019s bidding in suppressing the city\u2019s freedoms.\n\nLater Sunday, protesters entered the Tung Chung metro station in the neighborhood next to Hong Kong\u2019s airport and defaced it. They smashed glass panes, flooded the station and sprayed graffiti reading \u201ccommunist rail trash\u201d and \u201cglory to Hong Kong\u201d on the walls. Protesters also lit barricades and roadblocks on fire.\n\nThe MTR Corporation, which runs the subway system, has come under protester fire over perceptions that it is not keeping demonstrators and commuters safe from police brutality. The transportation operator closed stations closest to planned protests after Chinese state media accused it of facilitating the unrest.\n\n\n\nChina has threatened military action and held less than subtle crowd-control and riot drills across the border. Beijing\u2019s threats have changed policies, forced resignations and created a climate of fear in one of Hong Kong\u2019s most recognizable brands, the Cathay Pacific airline.\n\nStill, it is the Hong Kong police that has been the main tool for suppressing the protests. Saturday night\u2019s attacks on demonstrators, many of which were caught on video, alarmed residents, as the police have been dramatically increasing their use of force.\n\nVideos shot by reporters and eyewitnesses showed masked officers charging into a stalled subway car, swinging wildly at people crumpled on the floor. The officers used pepper spray within the car, leaving commuters screaming in pain and crying.\n\nAs protests were winding down in central Hong Kong, officers from an elite tactical unit stormed subway stations in Kowloon, across the harbor from Hong Kong Island, and arrested dozens.\n\nA focal point of the violence was the Prince Edward subway station, which connects passengers to a dense residential neighborhood and tourist sites including a flower market. A 30-year-old woman who was returning home from her office through the station said trains were running slower than usual, so she called her father to pick her up from the station. When she began to leave, she saw police storm in, and she rushed to alert others that they should flee.\n\n\u201cMore and more police kept coming in,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cThey rushed the protesters and started to beat them up.\u201d\n\nShe and others spoke on the condition of anonymity in fear of reprisals.\n\n\n\nPro-democracy protesters gather outside the airport. (Kin Cheung/AP)\n\nAnother commuter angrily yelled at an officer, who turned to confront her.\n\n\u201cI was worried that he was going to grab her,\u201d the woman said and started to cry. \u201cI just held the lady and patted her on the shoulder to show [the police] that she was not alone and they couldn\u2019t grab her.\u201d\n\nA 25-year-old woman who was waiting at Prince Edward station after seeing a movie said police swarmed in and began indiscriminately tackling people. The woman was shoved into a train car but quickly jumped out again.\n\n\u201cOnce the police came, the whole thing became a mess,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cops were beating citizens without differentiating them from protesters. If I didn\u2019t leave the train immediately, I would have been beaten by the police as well.\u201d\n\nAmong those arrested in the subway was a 13-year-old boy attending his first protest, according to a 22-year-old who had been keeping an eye on him. Police confirmed the arrest.\n\n\u201cI started crying because all he wanted to do was to fight for Hong Kong and experience the protests himself, but I couldn\u2019t keep him safe,\u201d said the older protester.\n\nA doctor returning from his shift at a public hospital left his subway car after an announcement from the MTR. As he took the escalator up from the platform, he said, police burst in and \u201cbegan dragging down anyone they could grab on to.\u201d\n\nHis work had largely kept him away from the demonstrations, he said, and he hadn\u2019t fully believed the stories about the police use of force this past summer. Now he does.\n\n\u201cThe police are not the police that we used to know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Hong Kong police are all gangsters until proven otherwise. I don\u2019t feel safe talking to a single policeman now.\u201d\n\nPolice officials said they were responding to protesters who were participating in an illegal assembly and destroying property in the subway stations. A police spokeswoman said officers used their \u201cprofessional experience\u201d to distinguish between protesters and ordinary commuters. She later acknowledged that it would have been difficult to tell them apart.\n\nRead more:\n\nWill China crush Hong Kong protests?
