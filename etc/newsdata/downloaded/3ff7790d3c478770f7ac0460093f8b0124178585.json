The deadline for complying with that subpoena is today.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to rely upon our general counsel to give me advice,\u201d he said.\n\nThe energy secretary also said his departure from Trump\u2019s Cabinet later this year had nothing to do with the swirling impeachment scandal engulfing the presidency.\n\n\u201cIt has absolutely nothing to do with Ukraine,\u201d Perry said of his departure, adding he\u2019s been thinking over the last eight or nine months about moving onto \u201cthe next adventure in life.\u201d\n\nPerry subsequently said he believed the White House would allow him to follow the advice of the DOE\u2019s Office of General Counsel, led by Bill Cooper, if lawyers recommended he comply with the subpoena.\n\n\"I'm going to follow the lead of the DOE counsel, and I'm sure working in concert with the White House counsel and regardless of what the president may have said a week ago about this, I think he will respect that position,\" Perry said on Fox News Radio.\n\nPerry said he would respond \"on time today\" to the subpoena and would \"follow the advice of my lawyers\" at DOE.\n\nIn addition, Perry said he was not aware the White House sent him to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in place of Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\"I had no idea that the vice president was even tapped to do it to begin with. I\u2019m off doing my work in other places and they call up and say, 'Hey, can you go?' And we looked at the schedule and said, 'Yes we can,'\" Perry said in the interview.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1d/6d/e1262f05494fb0ecae2273f84370/20191001-rick-perry-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
