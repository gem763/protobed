But plumes of black smoke are only rising above towns on the Syrian side.\n\nFrom the outside, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s war on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) appears to be a foreign policy disaster: Ankara is looking at possible sanctions and a European arms embargo, as well as a rising civilian death toll and accusations of war crimes that have led to a surge in international sympathy for Kurdish civilians bearing the brunt of the attack.\n\nAt home, however, it\u2019s a winner. Operation Peace Spring is not only the likely fulfilment of an important long-standing national security goal \u2013 it has allowed Erdogan to whip up nationalistic sentiment and drive a wedge through his political opposition, whose alliance has fallen apart over the Kurdish issue.\n\nAt least 24 people are facing terrorist propaganda charges for social media posts critical of the operation, and new investigations have been launched into members of the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP), the only political party that has voiced opposition.\n\nBut dissent is vanishingly rare in Erdogan\u2019s Turkey, particularly as the almost entirely pro-government media, pop stars and athletes have lined up to praise his leadership and bravery.\n\nAs a result, for most Turks, particularly in border towns such as Ak\u00e7akale that are facing SDF counterattacks, there is no doubt who the enemy is.\n\n\u201cThis is all your fault,\u201d one man said, emerging from a four-storey house hit by SDF shelling, visibly shaking with anger. In his hand he clutched a fragment from the mortar shell that killed a nine-month-old Syrian baby on the floor below and put his two older sisters in intensive care. \u201cYou westerners, you abandoned your Nato ally Turkey to support the terrorists. And now look what is happening.\u201d\n\nAfter Syrian president Bashar al-Assad withdrew his troops from the country\u2019s north-east in 2012 to concentrate on fighting rebels elsewhere, the local Kurdish population formed the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), a militia designed to protect the semi-autonomous state the Kurds carved out in the regime\u2019s absence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan poses for a selife during an African Muslim Religious Leaders Summit. Photograph: AP\n\nThe move greatly alarmed Turkey, as the YPG is so closely linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), an insurgency the state has battled for decades in fighting that has killed up to 40,000 people.\n\nAfter the rise of Islamic State in 2014, the US had a choice of ground partners in the battle: Syria\u2019s Arab rebel opposition, backed by Turkey, by that point tainted by war crimes, and Islamist links \u2013 or the YPG. The US chose the YPG, encouraging its leaders to rebrand as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and bring in Arab, Christian, Turkmen and Yazidi recruits in order to blur its origins.\n\nTurkey, furious, insisted throughout the five-year campaign against Isis that Kurdish cooperation was a Trojan horse that had strengthened an enemy all along its southern border.\n\nErdogan will use anyone and do anything to hang onto his power. The strategy is cruel\n\n\u201cThe policy [of backing the YPG] was not a long-term strategy,\u201d said one former official in Barack Obama\u2019s administration. \u201cWe knew it had to be temporary because there was no way Turkey would tolerate that threat.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, Erdogan is now set to get exactly what he wants.\n\nLast Sunday the Kurds struck a deal with Assad for military reinforcements to fend off the Turkish attack \u2013 a situation tolerable for Ankara, as it will dilute Kurdish control.\n\nA ceasefire agreed with US vice- president Mike Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Thursday allowed both Washington and Ankara to save face after Donald Trump\u2019s bizarre letter to Erdogan warning him \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool!\u201d, even though the fighting on the border has not halted.\n\nThe real deal is likely to be meshed out with Assad\u2019s ally, Russian president Vladimir Putin, during Erdogan\u2019s visit to Sochi on Tuesday. But with all parties apparently negotiating the size of Turkey\u2019s proposed border \u201csafe zone\u201d, rather than whether Turkish troops should leave or not, Erdogan\u2019s attack on the SDF looks set to be a success.\n\nDomestically, too, Erdogan emerges strengthened. The president\u2019s grip on power diminished in March for the first time in his 16 years in charge after voters punished him for Turkey\u2019s burgeoning economic crisis in crucial local elections across the country.\n\nTurkey\u2019s beleaguered opposition managed to wrest control of both the capital Ankara and economic hub Istanbul after the pro-Kurdish HDP gave its unofficial endorsement to the secular People\u2019s Republican Party (CHP), a landmark victory in a country where many fear democracy is failing.\n\nEkrem Imamoglu, Istanbul\u2019s new mayor, popular for his inclusive and anti-populist stance, surged to a resounding second victory in a re-run of the poll in June and is now touted as a possible presidential candidate in 2023. But he has voiced strong support for Erdogan\u2019s military operation that threatens to scupper the opposition\u2019s new-found solidarity.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties in Turkey, except HDP, easily unite when it comes to the Kurdish issue... the perception \u2018Turkey is under existential threat\u2019 is broadly shared by political actors,\u201d said Sinem Adar, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.\n\n\u201cThis undoubtedly has a quite devastating effect on HDP\u2019s trust in the opposition, especially after its support in the local elections. Given that Imamoglu\u2019s landslide victory in the re-run would not have been possible without the support of HDP voters, we can say that the breach of trust will be difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to repair.\u201d\n\nThe other target of Operation Peace Spring is Turkey\u2019s 3.6m Syrian refugee population. The government\u2019s attitude towards refugees has ebbed and flowed over the years, but after embracing those who now have citizenship as potential conservative AKP voters, this summer Syrians became the definitive scapegoat for Turkey\u2019s economic woes.\n\nAnkara says up to two million Syrians will be resettled in the proposed 20m (32km) deep border safe zone carved out of mainly Kurdish territory, even though most are Arabs originally from other parts of the county \u2013 and very few people seem keen to move to a place they have never been.\n\n\u201cWe [Syrians] are being used as political tools, yet again,\u201d said a Syrian woman in the Turkish border town of Gaziantep, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect her family.\n\n\u201cFilling that area with Arabs is demographic engineering that doesn\u2019t take our needs and safety into consideration. My son didn\u2019t go to school for three days last week because his teacher kept telling him \u2018It\u2019s time for you to go home.\u2019\n\n\u201cErdogan will use anyone and do anything to hang onto his power. The strategy is cruel. In this case it is leaving even more Syrians dead\u2026 But it works.\u201d", "description": "Despite last week\u2019s US-brokered truce, fighting continues on the Turkish-Syrian border", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35de2766c1536fe051b5f746c520058c1186d1ab/63_39_5288_3173/master/5288.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f21db8f27d98691a0ec6ac4324ddd871", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
