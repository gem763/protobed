It's the experience.\"\n\nHis rival Gantz has talked up his security experience and sought to portray himself as someone who can restore dignity to the premier's office, a reference to the corruption cases against his opponent.\n\n\"I'm telling you, we'll beat him,\" Gantz said in his own Friday television interview.\n\n\"I'm here to change the country. Bibi's end is a necessary part of it,\" he added, using Netanyahu's nickname.\n\n- Trump, Putin posters -\n\nRegardless of how many seats in the 120-seat parliament each win -- polls show around 30 -- a coalition will be necessary, and former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman could be kingmaker.\n\nLieberman and his nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party have touched a nerve with their campaign against the country's ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties, an influential part of Netanyahu's coalition.\n\nHe accuses them of seeking to impose Jewish religious law on Israel's secular population and wants legislation ending the ultra-Orthodox's exemption from mandatory military service. Polls show he has gained in popularity as a result.\n\nThat could allow him to decide who is granted the opportunity to form the next government -- and whether his old nemesis Netanyahu can seek immunity from prosecution in parliament, as many expect.\n\nNetanyahu has pushed to energise his base, including through tactics critics say amount to racism.\n\nHis Likud party has issued unfounded warnings that the election could be stolen through voter fraud in Arab areas, and Netanyahu sought last-minute legislation to allow party officials to bring cameras to polling stations.\n\nThe legislation, which ultimately failed, was widely seen as a bid to depress Arab turnout by intimidating members of the minority into staying away.\n\nBeyond that, Netanyahu has again sought to portray himself as Israel's essential leader.\n\nHe has highlighted his relationships with Trump, who has shifted US policy overwhelmingly in favour of Israel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he visited on Thursday.\n\nNetanyahu's campaign has included giant posters of himself with each leader, though Trump's recent suggestions he could meet with the leadership of Iran -- Israel's arch-enemy -- were seen as a blow to the premier.\n\n- 'Never go quietly' -\n\nGantz has faced criticism from some who say his campaign was too subdued, and he has suffered gaffes while speaking publicly.\n\nBut polls show he has maintained support from those ready to move on from Netanyahu.\n\nGantz and his Blue and White alliance, which includes three former military chiefs of staff, have criticised Netanyahu over a truce with Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that rules the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael's newly reunified Arab parties could also prove decisive if they manage a repeat performance similar to the 2015 elections, when they became the third-largest force in parliament.", "description": "Israel holds its second election in five months on Tuesday as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu battles for political survival and the question of how religious the country should become emerges as a surprise issue.
