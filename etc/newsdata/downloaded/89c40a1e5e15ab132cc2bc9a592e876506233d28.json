Thirty-four percent say Obama is the most to blame, followed by 23 percent who say Congress is the culprit. Twenty percent point the finger at Wall Street, and 18 percent cite former President George W. Bush.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe results highlight the reelection challenge Obama faces amid dissatisfaction with his first-term performance on the economy.\n\nThe poll, conducted for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research, found 53 percent of voters say Obama has taken the wrong actions and has slowed the economy down. Forty-two percent said he has taken the right actions to revive the economy, while six percent said they were not sure.\n\nObama has argued throughout the presidential campaign that his policies have made the economy better. He says recovery is taking a long time because he inherited such deep economic trouble upon taking office in 2009.\n\n\u201cThe problems we\u2019re facing right now have been more than a decade in the making,\u201d he told an audience last month in Cleveland.\n\nMore from The Hill:\n\n\u2666 Mormons on cusp of new powerful era in capital\n\n\u2666 Rewards, risks as Romney heads overseas amid campaign\n\n\u2666 Brown ad hits Warren on Obama's 'you didn't build that' remark\n\n\u2666 GOP ex-lawmaker: Facts will \u2018overwhelm\u2019 Republican opposition to climate change\n\n\u2666 Geithner set to defend actions on Libor scandal before Congress\n\n\u2666 Make-or-break time for cybersecurity bill\n\n\u2666 Challenges to Obama birth-control mandate piling up in court\n\n\u2666 Pre-election deal to avert sequestration looks unlikely\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s campaign, under the slogan \u201cForward,\u201d has sought to steer voter attention less toward current and past economic performance and more toward questions about Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s work in the private sector economy. It has launched attacks on the challenger\u2019s role as head of the private equity firm Bain Capital, casting him as a jobs \u201coutsourcer\u201d whose firm shipped thousands of U.S. positions overseas.\n\nThe Hill Poll, however, shows the extent to which voters hold Obama responsible for the economy and reveals his vulnerability should the election become primarily a referendum on his economic management.\n\nIt finds that voters strongly believe more could have been done by the White House and in Congress to achieve growth in the economy and employment.\n\nWhile 64 percent of voters consider this downturn to be \u201cmuch more severe\u201d than previous contractions, barely one quarter (26 percent) say the agonizingly slow pace of the recovery was unavoidable.\n\nWhile voters feel Obama carries a greater portion of the blame than others, the poll found almost 6-in-10 are unhappy with the actions of Republicans in Congress who have challenged the president on an array of policy initiatives.\n\nFifty-seven percent of voters said congressional Republicans have impeded the recovery with their policies, and only 30 percent overall believe the GOP has done the right things to boost the economy.\n\nThe tension between a Republican-controlled House of Representatives and a Democratic-run White House has also featured in Obama\u2019s campaign strategy.\n\nIn his economic speech last month in Cleveland, Obama cast the 2012 election as a chance to choose between two competing visions for the nation.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s holding us back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views of which direction America should take,\u201d he said. \u201cThis election is your chance to break that stalemate.\u201d\n\nRomney agrees that the election is a choice between two radically different views of America, but he characterizes it as a contest between his own vision of an industrious people free to achieve their dreams and Obama\u2019s faith in big government.\n\nIf there is a silver lining for Obama in the poll results, it\u2019s that centrist voters, who may well decide the 2012 outcome, tend to blame Republicans in Congress more than the president for hindering a more robust recovery.\n\nTwenty-six percent of centrists cited Congress as most to blame for U.S. economic woes, compared to 20 percent who blame Obama.\n\nSimilarly, 53 percent of centrists said Obama has taken the right actions as president to boost the economy, compared with 38 percent who said he had taken the wrong steps.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of centrist voters said Republicans had slowed the economy by taking wrong actions. Only 13 percent of centrists credited GOP lawmakers with policies that have helped the economy.\n\nThe poll found sharp differences in opinions along racial lines, with 94 percent of African-Americans saying Obama had taken the right actions on the economy, compared to 34 percent of white voters.\n\nThe Hill poll was conducted July 19 among 1,000 likely voters, and has a 3 percentage point margin of error.\n\nUPDATED: This story has been updated to show correct date the poll was conducted.\n\n\n\nClick here to view data from The Hill Poll.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Two-thirds of likely voters say the weak economy is Washington\u2019s fault, and more blame Obama than anybody else.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/obama-wh-lede_0.jpg", "published_at": "2012-07-23"}
