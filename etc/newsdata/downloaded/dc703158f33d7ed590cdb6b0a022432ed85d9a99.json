Gavin Newsom would blur the lines between college athletics and professional sports, Scott said Monday at Pac-12 women\u2019s basketball media day. Also, other states considering similar legislation would create an unbalanced state-by-state approach to governing amateur sports.\n\n\u201cWe are for choice and if young people want to earn money from their name, image or likeness or get paid to play, they should have that opportunity. That\u2019s called pro sports,\u201d said Scott, who met with the coaches and student-athletes Monday morning. \u201cCollege sports is different. You go to get an education. It\u2019s amateur, they\u2019re students. Those are the defining characteristics and we\u2019d like to see those lines not get blurred.\u201d\n\nThe California law is set to take effect in 2023.\n\nAlso Monday, Oregon was picked to win the Pac-12 for the third straight season in a poll of the conference coaches, followed by perennial power and defending Pac-12 Tournament champion Stanford and Oregon State in third.\n\nScott announced that the Pac-12 finalized arrangements to hold the men\u2019s and women\u2019s conference tournaments in Las Vegas for two more years, through March 2022.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott has expressed serious concerns about a new law that would allow college athletes in California to hire agents and be compensated for the use of their names or likenesses through endorsement deals or other money-making opportunities.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/pac-12_media_day_basketball_88306_c0-143-3413-2132_s1770x1032.jpg?fc620fc00088ce01fa04ea0c374ea27b68226442", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
