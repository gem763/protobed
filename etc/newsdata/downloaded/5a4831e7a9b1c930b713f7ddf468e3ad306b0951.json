First, the English translation of Putin\u2019s previous response was concluding as Mason began to speak. Second, the microphone seemed to pick up Mason\u2019s question halfway through\u2014making the latter half of it easier to hear. (Mason told me that he had held on to the microphone even though an official had tried to pull it away so that he could ask Putin a follow-up question. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they turned the sound off during the time when each of the presidents were speaking, or if it got flipped on and off. I certainly didn\u2019t touch anything.\u201d)\n\nTechnical difficulties aside, there\u2019s further ambiguity. It\u2019s unclear whether Putin said \u201cYes, I did\u201d in reference to the question of whether he wanted Trump to win the 2016 presidential race, or in response to the question about whether he directed Russian officials to help Trump win. \u201cYou could interpret that to mean he\u2019s answering \u2018yes\u2019 to both,\u201d Mason told me, but \u201clooking at it critically, he spent a good chunk of that press conference, just like President Trump did, denying any collusion. So I think it\u2019s likely that when he said \u2018Yes, I did,\u2019 that he was just responding to the first part of my question and perhaps didn\u2019t hear the second part.\u201d\n\nBut if you watch the White House live-stream of the press conference or look at the transcript published by the White House, the first half of Mason\u2019s question is not there. Without it, the meaning of the exchange is substantially different.\n\nCompare this transcript, of what actually happened, to the White House\u2019s version. Here is the record of what took place, starting with the last part of Putin\u2019s comments before Mason\u2019s questions. Putin is describing his willingness to assist with Robert Mueller\u2019s probe (bolding is mine):\n\nVladimir Putin: That could be a first step, and we can also extend it. Options abound, and they all can be found in an appropriate legal framework. Jeff Mason: President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that? Putin: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.\u2013Russia relationship back to normal.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the key section from the White House transcript, which makes it seem as though Putin is still talking about the Mueller probe:\n\nPRESIDENT PUTIN: That could be a first step, and we can also extend it. Options abound, and they all can be found in an appropriate legal framework. Q: And did you direct any of your officials to help him do that? PRESIDENT PUTIN: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.\u2013Russia relationship back to normal.\n\nAnother strange wrinkle comes from the Russian government\u2019s English-language transcript of the press conference. In contrast to its footage of the press conference, which features what really happened, the transcript does not include any piece of that key exchange.", "description": "It\u2019s not clear whether the omission was intended, but the meaning of a key exchange is dramatically altered as a result.", "authors": ["Uri Friedman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/07/RTX6BND6/facebook.jpg?1531840980", "published_at": "2018-07-17"}
