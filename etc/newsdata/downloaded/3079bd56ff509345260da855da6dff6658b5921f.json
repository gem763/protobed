This issue only occurs on devices that have disabled searching the web using Windows Desktop Search,\" Microsoft said in the security update KB4515384 released yesterday.\n\nStill, a small number of Windows Insiders had reported the same issue through the Feedback Hub in preview testing of the buggy update, which Microsoft missed despite recent efforts to improve its detection of narrowly reported issues\n\nThe Patch Tuesday update address two zero-day elevation of privilege flaws that were under attack already. The update included 80 security fixes.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft patched two remote code execution bugs in the Remote Desktop Protocol. However, these don't appear to be as dangerous as the recent BlueKeep and DejaBlue vulnerabilities, which could be used to create a wormable exploit to automatically infect vulnerable machines on the same network.\n\n\"Unlike BlueKeep and DejaBlue, these members of the Blue Bug Group are all client-side. An attacker would need to convince someone to connect to their malicious RDP server or otherwise intercept (MITM) the traffic,\" said Dustin Childs from Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.\n\n\"It's good to see these issues patched, but they don't carry the urgency of the recent wormable bugs.\"\n\nMore on Microsoft's Windows 10 updates", "description": "Microsoft addresses bug causing CPU problems for the past two weeks for Windows 10 version 1903 users.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/11/f94a4ab5-c591-4e92-9361-17cfc39cd62d/thumbnail/770x578/c22abb49e0b01232fb85a32b8af4afaa/businessmanlaptopistock-1158476100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
