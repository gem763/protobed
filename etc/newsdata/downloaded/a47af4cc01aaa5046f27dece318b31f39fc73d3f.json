I have no idea how old Leslie Ruffing is, but I have a hard time believing she\u2019s never seen a variation of either of these signs before.\n\nRuffing says she talked to a manager and demanded that the corporate offices be made aware of her complaint. And then, of course, she took to social media to complain.\n\n. @HobbyLobby I\u2019d love to know why on earth you think it\u2019s OK to sell merchandise that blatantly glorifies and encourages gun violence.\n\nI echoed my disgust to the manger on duty who agreed to elevate my concern to your corporate office.\n\nIt\u2019s 2019. Let\u2019s do better. pic.twitter.com/HkCeja8wjT \u2014 LDR (@LRuff11) September 30, 2019\n\nI kinda like the sign on the left, actually, though I will still call 911 as soon as it\u2019s possible for me to do so if someone ever tries to break into my home. Then again, I\u2019m also not a humorless scold. As Dave Workman of the Second Amendment Foundation told Yahoo Lifestyle, this is just an attempt to manufacture a controversy.\n\n\u201cPeople that have mailboxes that look like guns and bumper stickers that promote firearms ownership \u2014 and what you sent me pictures of \u2014 are [designed] to be humorous,\u201d Dave Workman tells Yahoo Lifestyle, adding anyone taking issue with the signs sold at Hobby Lobby \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have a sense of humor.\u201d \u201cThe people who buy stuff like this, it\u2019s just a novelty, and they haven\u2019t hurt anybody. Trying to demonize having anything to do with firearms because of those instances is kind of ridiculous,\u201d says Workman.\n\nI drive past a mailbox shaped like a shotgun shell (branded with a Hornady logo) every day on my way in to Farmville, Virginia. Not once has it ever occurred to me that the mailbox is threatening or designed to instill fear, but I have a feeling if a gun control activist like Ruffing saw that same mailbox she\u2019d be blasting the U.S. Postal Service on social media and demanding mail carriers stop delivering to the home to send a message (ironically enough). Ruffing has made it clear she\u2019s opposed to anything that might promote gun ownership.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re scared to go church, to the movies, to concerts, scared to send our children to schools,\u201d Ruffing says. \u201cThose who contribute to this dangerous gun culture should be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cGun culture\u201d is dangerous. What Ruffing is talking about is lawful gun culture. Has she complained to Spotify about songs glorifying murder and violence that can be streamed for free, for instance? If so, she certainly hasn\u2019t made as big a stink about it as she did for her trip to Hobby Lobby. No, what this is about is trying to other-ize and de-normalize legal gun ownership, and gun control activists will keep doing this every chance they get.\n\nSo far there\u2019s been no response from Hobby Lobby. We\u2019ll let you know if that changes.", "description": "An Illinois gun control activist says she was \"disgusted\" by gun-related signs she found in her local Hobby Lobby.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/187/27fb6a54-e6ff-411f-ade8-f71d4b71b033.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
