Aidan was not even 5 months old. We went and we voted, and then I spent time with our kids and spent a lot of time breastfeeding and pumping, because that\u2019s what women do when we\u2019re committed to having that relationship with our babies,\" Clinton said.\n\nChelsea Clinton says what she was doing on election night.

Her chief of staff, Bari Lurie, said that Clinton will have a conversation about family border separation with her 5-year-old daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.\n\n\"I walk into her apartment at 7:30 in the morning and she is teaching her daughter about how unfair and unjust it is,\" Lurie said. \"Don\u2019t get me wrong; there\u2019s also a debate about last night\u2019s episode of The Voice. It can be puzzling to others, but to those who know her best, it is one of the most endearing things about Chelsea.\"\n\nChelsea Clinton introduces her mother, Hillary Clinton, on the final day of the Democratic National Convention.
