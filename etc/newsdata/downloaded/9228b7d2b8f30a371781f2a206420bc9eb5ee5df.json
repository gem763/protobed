USA TODAY\n\nSan Francisco 49ers running back Matt Breida hit a top speed of 22.3 miles per hour on his 83-yard touchdown run in the first quarter of Monday night's 31-3 win over the Cleveland Browns.\n\nBreida's speed is the fastest reached by a ball carrier on any play since the start of the 2018 season, according to the NFL's Next Gen Stats.\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Breida has two of the top three fastest times for a ball carrier in that timeframe, having hit 22.09 miles per hour during the 49ers' 27-9 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 12 of last season.\n\nHere's Breida's 83-yard touchdown run, the longest of his NFL career:\n\nThe Chicago Bears' Cordarrelle Patterson hit 22.23 miles per hour \u2014 per Next Gen Stats \u2014 during his team's Week 2 win against the Denver Broncos.\n\nBreida, who is in his third NFL season, was signed as an undrafted free agent by the 49ers out of Georgia Southern. Breida was not invited to the NFL Scouting Combine after a disappointing senior season. However, he displayed NFL-caliber speed at his pro day. Breida had a 40-yard dash time of 4.38 seconds, according to Georgia Southern, which was just a hundredth of a second off of the top time registered by a running back at that year's combine.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
