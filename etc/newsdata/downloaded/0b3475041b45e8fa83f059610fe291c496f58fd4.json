For more information, see The Daily Beast's reporting here.\n\nFor decades, financier Jeffrey Epstein allegedly abused dozens of underage girls in a sex-trafficking enterprise, according to a new federal indictment unsealed in the Southern District of New York.\n\nBut in order to successfully \u201ccreate a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit\u201d and expand his network of possible targets, he relied on the loyalty and organizational skills of his employees, prosecutors claim.\n\nAccording to the 14-page indictment filed in Manhattan federal court on Monday, the 66-year-old hedge-fund manager/convicted sex offender \u201cworked and conspired with others, including employees and associates\u201d to run a sex-trafficking enterprise between 2002 and 2005, preying on \u201cdozens\u201d of girls as young as 14 at his mansions in New York and Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nDuring each encounter listed in the indictment\u2014which charges Epstein with one count of sex trafficking and one count of sex-trafficking conspiracy\u2014girls were taken to a room to perform \u201cmassages\u201d nude or partially nude before Epstein would escalate the encounter to \u201cinclude one or more sex acts.\u201d\n\n\u201cEpstein typically would also masturbate during these sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims\u2019 genitals with his hands or with sex toys,\u201d the indictment states, adding the money man knew that the girls were minors.\n\nAfter the assault, prosecutors allege, Epstein or his associates would pay each girl hundreds of dollars in cash and often would turn the victim into a recruiter of new girls to abuse.\n\n\u201cIn this way, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit,\u201d the indictment said. The indictment goes on to detail three anonymous victims and refers to three unnamed employees who allegedly assisted Epstein in the enterprise, including by making calls to arrange for \u201cmassages\u201d for Epstein.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Epstein\u2019s employees and associates have been accused of helping procure underage girls for his abuse.\n\nIn Epstein\u2019s controversial 2008 plea deal in Florida\u2014which was granted by then-prosecutor and now-Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta and other DOJ attorneys, without informing the billionaire\u2019s alleged victims\u2014four women are named as possible accomplices. Epstein\u2019s non-prosecution agreement, which sentenced him to 18 months in prison, also granted immunity to the four women and any other \u201cpotential co-conspirators,\" identified in the document as \u201cincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Epstein was at the head of the international sex trafficking organization, that conspiracy could not have functioned without many others playing their part,\u201d attorney Paul Cassell, who represents multiple victims of Epstein, told The Daily Beast after Epstein\u2019s arrest on Saturday. \u201cJane Doe 1 and 2 will continue to fight for all of Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators to be held accountable in New York, Florida, and anywhere else they committed crimes.\u201d\n\nDetails of Epstein\u2019s alleged trafficking in Monday\u2019s indictment mirror the accounts of scores of underage women in Florida, who described several \u201cschedulers\u201d who organized his alleged sex sessions and one young woman, described as Epstein\u2019s \u201csex slave,\u201d who would allegedly participate in the abuse while the billionaire watched.\n\nBut where are Epstein\u2019s alleged accomplices now?\n\nSarah Kellen\n\nSarah Kellen, Epstein\u2019s former assistant who allegedly kept a Rolodex of young girls to recruit for her employer, is now married to NASCAR driver Brian Vickers. Along with traveling with her husband, the 39-year-old (who also goes by the name Sarah Kensington) is the owner of an interior-design firm, SLK Designs.\n\n\u201cSarah Kensington makes a living doing what she loves in life, interior design,\u201d a Facebook page connected to SLK Designs states. \u201cShe is the owner of SLK Designs LLC. and has studies at several schools including the University of Hawaii and New York School of Interior Design.\u201d The social-media page also details Sarah\u2019s interests, which include \u201cfashion, photography, travel, delicious cuisine, and anything design related.\u201d\n\nThe page also notes that Sarah \u201cis working with a number of clients on various projects including renovating several corporate apartments in New York, the Caribbean, and Paris. For the houses that Sarah manages, she does a number of duties which can involve organizing staff schedules, looking for and interviewing housekeepers and chefs, purchase and source items that are needed for the household (flatware, dishes, furniture, art, etc.), design floral arrangements, and interior design.\u201d\n\nEpstein also owns homes in New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Paris.\n\nAccording to public records, SLK Designs once operated from a building in Midtown Manhattan owned by Epstein\u2019s property-manager brother, Mark Epstein. The condominium listed to take SLK Designs deliveries, at 301 E. 66th St., is the same address where Epstein allegedly rented units to house models.\n\nThough not directly named in Monday\u2019s indictment, Kellen has been accused in court documents related to the Florida case of booking the \u201cmassages,\u201d often calling girls to ensure they \u201cwere available for encounters\u201d when Epstein would travel to Palm Beach. Several alleged victims in Florida told authorities they were led to and from the upstairs room in Epstein\u2019s mansion by a woman named Sarah, after she lined up the oils on his massage table. According to one police report, Kellen also warned the girls not to talk to authorities about the encounters.\n\nMonday\u2019s indictment contains similar allegations about unnamed Epstein employees. \u201cWhen a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of Epstein\u2019s, including, at times, two assistants who, as described herein, were also responsible for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims,\u201d the Monday indictment states.\n\nKellen also reportedly traveled on Epstein\u2019s private plane with former President Bill Clinton on at least 11 flights between 2002 and 2003, according to flight logs published by Gawker in 2015.\n\nKellen, who has properties in North Carolina, New York, and Miami Beach, did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment. A NASCAR spokesperson told The Daily Beast the organization does \u201cnot have a comment\u201d about Kellen\u2019s alleged misconduct.\n\nNadia Marcinkova\n\nNadia Marcinkova, Epstein\u2019s alleged \u201csex slave\u201d who was accused of participating in sexual encounters with underage girls, is now an FAA-certified commercial pilot and flight instructor. Marcinkova, 33, who was allegedly brought from the former Yugoslavia to live with Epstein, now goes by the named \u201cGlobal Girl\u201d on social media, and has changed her last name.\n\n\u201cGlobal Girl (Nadia Marcinko) spent many years in the international marketing and advertising world as an international fashion model and spokesperson, with clients including Chanel, Christian Dior, Valentino, Vogue and MTV. After many successful years in the modeling industry, she was ready for longer runways and became a licensed commercial pilot,\u201d her Facebook account states, adding that she is an \u201cFAA certified flight instructor and Gulfstream II, III & IV pilot.\u201d\n\nMarcinkova also is the founder and CEO of Aviloop, a website selling discounted flying lessons and other deals related to aviation. Since 2011, Aviloop provides a slew of services, including designing custom pilot team and \u201corganizing team building events.\u201d As with Kellen, the aviation company is registered at the building once owned by Mark Epstein and allegedly used as a model clubhouse by his brother.\n\nThough Marcinkova originally started calling herself \"Gulfstream Girl,\u201d she was sued in 2013 by Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. for trademark infringement. On Jan. 6, 2014, the lawsuit filed in a New York Southern District court was settled after Marcinko changed her online name to Global Girl.\n\nAccording to written testimony by several alleged victims, Marcinkova is described as having \u201cencouraged and engaged in sexual acts\u201d with young girls while Epstein watched. According to police, Epstein told one victim Marcinkova was his \u201csex slave\u201d and that he\u2019d purchased her from her family in the former Yugoslavia when she was 15. Marcinkova is not directly named in Monday\u2019s indictment.\n\nMarcinkova, who lives in New York, did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAdriana Ross\n\nAdriana Ross, a former model from Poland who allegedly helped organize Epstein\u2019s predatory sessions, moved to Florida in 2002 and was hired to work at the financier\u2019s mansion. Ross, who often went by Adriana Mucinska and is not directly named in Monday\u2019s indictment, also frequently flew on Epstein\u2019s private jet alongside Bill Clinton, according to flight records.\n\nAlong with her fellow alleged co-conspirators, Ross was questioned in 2010 about whether Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew participated in Epstein\u2019s alleged sex enterprise. Refusing to answer questions about the inner workings of the alleged scheme, Ross repeatedly invoked her Fifth Amendment rights, according to previous reports. As previously reported by The Daily Beast, Ross also lived at the East 66th Street building in Manhattan.\n\nRoss\u2019 current profession or address was not immediately clear and she could not be reached for comment.\n\nLesley Groff\n\nLesley Groff was another Epstein assistant who allegedly coordinated travel for young girls, often calling to schedule \u201cmassages.\u201d Though not directly named in Monday\u2019s indictment, the 51-year-old has been previously named as one of Epstein\u2019s three female assistants. According to a 2005 Chicago Tribune story about executive-assistant pay, Epstein divulged his assistants made about $200,000.\n\n\u201cThey are an extension of my brain. Their intuition is something that I don\u2019t have,\u201d Epstein told the Tribune. According to public records, Groff currently lives in Connecticut and did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.", "description": "When prosecutors gave Jeffrey Epstein a sweetheart plea deal in 2007, they agreed not to charge four women allegedly involved in recruiting dozens of underage girls for abuse.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1562621212/190708-pilar-epstein-co-Conspirators-tease_ybphtf", "published_at": "2019-07-09"}
