The country stockpiles other staples, too, such as sugar, rice, edible oils and animal feed.\n\nThis system of emergency reserves was established between World War I and World War II as Switzerland prepared for any potential shortages in case of war, natural disaster or epidemics.\n\nAccording to the plan released for public comment, coffee stockpiling obligations would expire by the end of 2022, with companies free to draw down what they store in their warehouses.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Office for National Economic Supply has concluded coffee...is not essential for life,\u201d the government said. \u201cCoffee has almost no calories and subsequently does not contribute, from the physiological perspective, to safeguarding nutrition.\u201d\n\nA final decision on scrapping coffee stockpiles is expected in November.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s mandatory coffee reserves are now spread over 15 companies, including Nestle, and amount to about 15,300 tonnes, enough to cover three months of the Alpine state\u2019s domestic coffee consumption.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s 8.5 million residents consume around nine kg (20 lb) of coffee per person annually, eclipsing Britain\u2019s 3.3 kg average and double the 4.5 kg consumed in the United States, according to International Coffee Organization figures.\n\nNot everyone wants to see the Swiss strategic coffee reserve disappear, however.\n\nReservesuisse, the Bern-based organization that oversees Switzerland\u2019s food stockpiles, last year asked the Federal Office to reconsider its recommendation.\n\nOf the 15 companies that hold mandatory coffee stockpiles, Reservesuisse said, 12 wanted to continue, in part, because the existing system helps buttress the supply chain. Some also contend too little attention was paid to the drink\u2019s health benefits, like antioxidants or vitamins.\n\n\u201cStockpile operators\u2019 concerns clearly show that the one-sided review and weighting of calories as the main criteria for a vital staple did not do justice to coffee,\u201d Reservesuisse wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.\n\nA Nestle spokeswoman declined to comment on its position.\n\nSwitzerland finances its mandatory coffee stockpile via a fee of 3.75 Swiss francs on every 100 kg of imported beans, raising 2.7 million Swiss francs ($2.70 million) annually to compensate companies for storing beans.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Freshly roasted coffee beans fall into a tumbler after the drum type roaster is opened by an employee at H.
