The woman has finally revealed her identity ahead of her new memoir detailing her the experience and its aftermath. Her name: Chanel Miller.\n\nThe Stanford assault occurred on January 18, 2015. Brock Turner, who was 19-years-old at the time, allegedly sexually assaulted Miller with his fingers on the school's campus after a party while she was unconscious. The assault ended only after two Swedish international students intervened, apprehended Turner, and contacted the police. The police reportedly found Miller curled behind a garbage dumpster in the fetal position.\n\nWhat followed was a court case that appeared to highlight some of the darkest elements of life on college campuses, and it placed Miller's words at the forefront. Miller's detailed story, along with a perceived failure of the California justice system to hold Turner accountable, helped reignite a national conversation about rape on college campuses.\n\nBrock Turner, the former Stanford swimmer convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, leaves the Santa Clara County Jail in San Jose, California, U.S. September 2, 2016. Reuters/Stephen Lam\n\nUnknown by name to the public at that time, Miller's victim impact statement, which can be read here, began with these chilling words.\n\n\"You don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why we're here today,\" Miller said in her court statement.\n\nMiller's case shed light on campus rape culture and helped set the stage for the #MeToo movement.\n\nFollowing Miller's statement, Turner was found guilty of three felonies, including intent to commit rape of an unconscious person. The maximum sentence for those charges is 14 years in prison, but Turner served just three months in county jail. The lenient sentencing led to an outpouring of criticism towards the judge and the methods with which the US judicial system handles punishment for sexual assault cases. In the years since Miller released her court statement, the Turner case has come to signify what some have described as the lack of consequences for college rapists.\n\nWhile Miller's case preceded much of what has come to be known as the #MeToo movement, her story and the public reaction to it led to meaningful reforms. The judge who determined Turner's six-month verdict (with only three months served) was recalled by California voters and the state's governor, in a clear reference to Miller's case, introduced mandatory minimum sentences for sexual assaults.\n\nMiller wrote her memoir to \"reclaim her identity.\"\n\nFour years after the assault, Miller is preparing to release the written account of her life and the process of recovery. It was a process, according to Miller's publisher, that continued long after the story fell out of the media limelight.\n\nIn a description of Know My Name, the book's publisher, Viking, says Miller wrote the book to, \"reclaim her identity,\" and \"to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words.\" CBS' \"60 Minutes\" announced on Wednesday that they will air an interview with Miller on September 22. The show posted a brief clip of the interview on Twitter.\n\nViking publishing's editor in chief Andrea Schulz told the New York Times how she had followed Miller's words with interest dating back to her court statement. \"I just remember being in my kitchen and reading this incredible, riveting piece of work,\" Shulz said.\n\nThe Viking editor and Miller worked together closely on the book. Shulz told the Times that she would field weekly phone calls with Miller to go over the details and vision for the book set to release September 24. \"It's one of the most important books that I've ever published,\" Shulz told The Times.", "description": "The woman was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a former Stanford University student who was convicted but only served three months in jail.", "authors": ["Mack Degeurin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d702a3621214c03d03f6eba-960-480.jpg"}
