When these animals try to venture out into the limited space that if left for them, they end up dying for literally no fault of theirs.\n\nThe death of an elephant last week had evoked strong angry reactions from everyone.\n\nIFS Parveen Kaswan had tweeted the heartbreaking video where an elephant can be seen, wounded beyond help, most of the flesh from its legs torn off, struggling to get on its feet.\n\nI know you will find it painful & schocking. But such things are happening & require our attention. FD team reached location on time, provided medical help also. We don't know much about internal injury. A team stayed near him in night. Video to ponder. pic.twitter.com/DNZUzNfjN2 \u2014 Parveen Kaswan, IFS (@ParveenKaswan) September 28, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 1.4 K SHARES 531 SHARES 11.4 K SHARES 508 SHARES\n\nNot that this wasn't depressing, the news of the jumbo succumbing to its injury sent shockwaves across animal lovers in the country.\n\nEven celebrities like Randeep Hooda and Sonu Sood expressed their anguish and displeasure on the turn of events calling out for proactive measures in saving our endangered animals.\n\nAnd he\u2019s passed away .. probably a good thing as he was really suffering and beyond a point of cure .. hope this can lead to some serious thought and scrutiny for further prevention of such accidents ..RIP \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd @PiyushGoyal @PiyushGoyalOffc @RailMinIndia @RailNf @moefcc @PMOIndia https://t.co/InHfqx5Ovw \u2014 Randeep Hooda (@RandeepHooda) September 28, 2019\n\nIt is high time authorities realise that treading into these animals' territories is wrong and there should be better alternatives for development.", "description": "Development is a good thing that can happen to a country but it definitely comes at a cost.
