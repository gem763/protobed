Now, he has published them in a new book\n\nThe amateur photographer took the snaps in cities and towns across the globe. Pictured, a dog sniffing out a magazine about fellow pooches in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire in 2016\n\nThe 66-year-old walked hundreds of miles to compile the book as a testament to man's love of dogs, including this pooch that decided to try and drive a tractor in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in 2016\n\nThe published work Barking!, which includes these two dogs sharing an encounter in the streets of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in 2014, contains more than 200 pictures of man's best friend\n\nHe continued: 'I would often walk and stalk for miles and then get down to their level with a wide-angle lens, set to a fast shutter speed, fire away and hope. '\n\n'Sometimes I have got too close to snarling dogs, unhappy owners or to a Yorkie that cocked its leg over me and my camera.'\n\n'Most of my pictures are candid, but I often find some of the best are when a dog sees me and reacts. I look for eye contact and sometimes even do a little bark or woof to encourage them.'\n\nChris Porsz (pictured) took the photos while travelling across the world over more than 40 years\n\nChris first caught the photography bug after buying a camera when his first child Simon was born in 1978.\n\nHe began walking the streets of his hometown of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, for inspiration and quickly developed a passion for street photography.\n\nHe later decided to hone his craft by visiting other cities and often found himself taking pictures of dogs.\n\n'In the early eighties I looked for characters who stood out from the crowd, such as the teds and punks and, by chance, a few dogs,' explained Chris.\n\n'One surreal man-dog image taken by the photographer Elliot Erwitt in New York depicting a bulldog sat on its owner\u2019s knee, inspired me to start looking for more funny dogs and my collection of pictures soon grew.\n\n'I frequently cut off the owners to give the dogs centre-stage.\n\n'To be honest the dogs are often more interesting characters.But sometimes I\u2019ll keep the owner in, to show the intimate relationship with their best friends.'\n\nOver the last four decades Chris has spent many weekends and days off from his job as a paramedic at the East of England Ambulance Service travelling around the country photographing pooches.\n\nDescribing how he got the photos, including this dog's rather long ears in Lincoln, Chris said he would get down on the animal's level and use a wide-angle lens set to a fast shutter speed\n\nHis photos, depicting how much people love dogs, include this rather grumpy looking bulldog leaning out of a van in London\n\nThis woman in Blackpool is allowing her dog to unwind in the bicycle basket as she takes it out for a spin on the roads\n\nThis pooch was photographed perched on top of a bin in Vienna, which Chris found during his travels around the world\n\nWhen Chris takes his pictures, including of this little dog being cradled by its owner on the subway in New York, he does a little woof or bark in order to encourage them\n\nThe iconic snaps, including of this rather large dog being held up by its owner in Brighton, tend to aim to have the pet centre-stage, Chris said, as they are often much more interesting characters\n\nHowever, at times Chris said he would also keep the owner in, including this pair munching burgers while their dog looks on in Brighton, in order to show the intimate relationship with their best friends\n\nHe has a number of favourite images in the book, including the front cover, which shows a dog leaping in front of the camera in Union Square, New York.\n\n'I love the front cover because it is so dramatic,' explained Chris. 'It\u2019s interesting as it\u2019s a picture I was originally not going to take as it was just a dog catching a ball and seemed a bit boring.'\n\n'The dog had been facing its owner as she threw the ball to him but he suddenly flipped over to face me. Luckily I instinctively raised my camera and snapped him just at the right moment.'\n\nAnother favourite is a photo of a dog peeing on a funny blackboard sign in Brighton which states, 'Whoever said diamonds are a girl\u2019s best friend never owned a dog'.\n\nHe added: 'I spotted the sign and waited for an hour to see if anyone would walk by with a dog. I couldn\u2019t believe it when a dog walked past and peed on it, the picture was better than I could have imagined.'\n\nThis picture of a dog getting a haircut in his hometown of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, made the cut for the book\n\nThis dog, photographed in Barking, London, got caught up in the hustle and bustle of the capital with its owner\n\nThis pair got sprayed by the sea while they visited the beach in Brighton, England, and were photographed by Chris\n\nOne pooch pictured in the book in Brighton, left, clearly didn't think much of playing catch. Chris is also shown with his family's dog (right) Murphy as he cycles through some parkland\n\nThis pair were shown sticking their heads out of a bag as their owner walked through parkland in London, England\n\nWhile visiting Barking, London, Chris said he struggled to find many dogs to photograph - but found this one at the station\n\nThese children in Liverpool are sat playing on a phone waiting for their parents as three huskies also doze in the other sections\n\nThis lady and dog were so happy to be re-united that the dog leapt up onto the woman as she smiled. Pictured in New York\n\nThis dog, snapped in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, spotted some sausages on a billboard that he liked the look of\n\nChris had less luck when he visited Barking in London - and struggling to find any dogs to snap.\n\n'I sat for hours on Barking station hoping to capture a dog in front of the welcome sign but none came along and I was even approached by security for looking suspicious,' he explained.\n\n'I also waited for hours outside The Spotted Dog for a dalmatian and outside The Barking Dog for a barking dog, but I had no luck. It just goes to show that the best pictures tend to be the ones which I don\u2019t try to stage.\n\n'I had to go back three times to Barking to finally achieve the image of Colin the train spotter and his best friend Rosie.'\n\nChris\u2019 book Barking! costs \u00a310 and is available from www.chrisporsz.com.\n\nThese three pups, photographed in Melton Mowbray, have the appearance of walking mops when they run\n\nA dog in New York is stroked by a man next to a police officer outside a customer service booth in New York\n\nThis dog, walking away from the tables in London, may be dreaming about being somewhere else\n\nAfter walking around the winding iconic streets of Venice this dog protested that it had had enough, and flopped on the floor\n\nA little boy stares through some boarded up iron gates in Paris, France, next to his dog that is tied to the railings\n\nA small pooch hops up onto its owners knee to beg for some chips in Skegness, near Lincoln, as he tucks into a meal\n\nA dog and its owner go for a run past a rainbow coloured sign in the British city of Brighton, England\n\nA woman was snapped taking her rather wet pooch for a walk past a fountain in Oslo, Norway's capital\n\nThese three dogs are enjoying soaking up the sun at the seaside town of Skegness, near Lincoln\n\nThis pooch is so thrilled to see this man outside The Old Dog pub in Nottingham that it leapt up into his arms\n\nA dog takes a stroll through London wearing a shirt, waistcoat, bow tie and four very fancy shoes\n\nOne dog, photographed in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, completely obscured the view of its owner\n\nA dog takes refuge inside a coat that was left inside a cardboard box in Paris, France\n\nOne canine started to lap up the water from a fountain during a distinctly mild day in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire\n\nThis pooch went for a fancy-stroll with its well dressed owner through Brighton, as it sported two bright pink feathers\n\nThis pet went for alternative transport in London after slotting itself into what appears to be a rolled up rug\n\nAnd this pooch couldn't wait to get its teeth wrapped around a tennis ball on top of a hill in London\n\nTwo dogs have a bark at something they don't like in Brighton, while wearing pyjamas, as a dog is carried in Rome, Italy\n\nTwo dogs, pictured here in New York, are greeting each other through sniffs.
