Their concern is that if the mayor doesn't make good on his promise, they'll be forced back into their local public schools.\n\nAs the demonstrations drew to a close, the mayor exited his vehicle just feet away.\n\nBILL DE BLASIO BOOED AS 'WORST MAYOR EVER' AT COLUMBUS DAY PARADE\n\nWith students loudly chanting, \"Kids before politics,\" the former 2020 presidential candidate averted his eyes and ambled into the building.\n\nMoskowitz told \"The Story's\" host Martha MacCallum that Success Academy students are among the highest-performing in their area.\n\nAt Success Academy Rosedale, 99 percent of students passed their math examinations and 96 percent passed English. At their Far Rockaway location, 94 percent passed math and 84 percent passed English.\n\nMayoral spokeswoman Jane Meyer claimed that he is committed to engaging the community.\n\n\"The mayor understands the power of grassroots movements and supports the right of New Yorkers to make their voices heard on issues that matter,\" she said.\n\nMoskowitz isn't buying it.\n\n\"Well, he's been claiming that for 33 months,\" she told MacCallum. \"You know, kids grow older and we've known that they were going to need a middle school. So, for 33 months we've been on our hands and knees saying, 'Give these really high-performing kids of color a school.' So, I don't believe him.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"They're No. 1 in the state of New York and yet we have to fight this mayor for space every single year,\" she said exasperatedly.\n\n\"I say it's political,\" said Moskowitz.\n\n\"The mayor has been working on behalf of the unions, and the unions have their place. But, the mayor's supposed to work on behalf of the children and teaching and learning and he has refused to do so,\" she said.", "description": "All Success Academy children are asking for is a middle school, founder and CEO of Success Academy Schools\u00a0Eva Moskowitz said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/bill-deblasio-Erin-Moscowitz-AP-FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
