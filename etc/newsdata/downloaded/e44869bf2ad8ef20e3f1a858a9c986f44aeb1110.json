hoping to announce additional long-term capital projects to the \u00a313.4 billion of extra spending set out in September\u2019s spending review.\n\nAnnouncing the budget date last week, the chancellor made clear that the timing was dependent on the UK leaving the EU with a deal on Halloween.\n\nIn the case of a no-deal outcome, the government would priorities swift action to support the economy, business and households, and the formal budget announcement would be pushed back by some weeks as official economic forecasters draw up new predictions for the public finances.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s official spokesman made clear that the 6 November date would not necessarily be scrapped if the EU offers a Brexit extension.\n\nBut he said: \u201cThe budget announcement was working towards a scenario in which we would leave the EU with a deal on 31 October, which is still what we are trying to achieve.\n\n\u201cIf, because that process has been frustrated by parliament, that is no longer possible, we will have to update you closer to the time.\u201d", "description": "November\u2019s budget could be postponed if the House of Commons fails to ratify Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit
