Here's how you get it done.\n\nDon't Throw Your Old Xbox Or PlayStation In The Bin While used PS4s and Xboxes may not make up a significant portion of e-waste, that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t contributing to the problem. If you have any used gaming consoles, don\u2019t trash them \u2014 you can likely re-sell them at any electronics store or recycle them at the very least. Read more\n\nThe Outer Worlds has been released into the world today and is shaping up to be an impressive RPG filled with murderous aliens and hungry monsters. The game throws you into a timeline that diverged from the real world's in 1901 with US President, William McKinley, never being assassinated. This sets of a chain of events (Teddy Roosevelt never becomes president) and fast-forward to the 2300s and mega-corporations run the joint and have begun to colonise planets.\n\nYour player wakes up on a cryo spaceship that has veered to the edges of the human colony's reaches and begins the journey into uncovering what the shadowy mega-corporations are up to.\n\nIt's undeniably Fallout-esque with its intriguing storyline, familiar skill tree and armour customisation but it also defies Earth's boundaries where the Fallout series doesn't.\n\nHow do I get The Outer Worlds for $1?\n\nThere is a slight catch. You'll need to sign up for Xbox Game Pass on PC, which is still in beta. The special going right now means it's going to cost you a total of $1 for the first month and $4.95 for each month after. If you manage to finish the entire game within that first month and then unsubscribe, then bam, you just paid $1 to play The Outer Worlds.\n\nTo sign up for Xbox Game Pass for PC, head to the sign up page and pop in your Microsoft account details and you'll be on your way to playing it (after you download the thing, of course).\n\nWhat other games are available?\n\nThe great thing is it's not just The Outer Worlds and a bunch of other low-quality games. Other impressive titles, out of the 151 included, are:\n\nGears 5\n\nDishonored 2\n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance\n\nMetro Exodus\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider\n\nSea Of Thieves\n\nWolfenstein II\n\nHow To Control Your Xbox One With Google Assistant There are now even more ways for you to navigate your Xbox One without using a controller. Microsoft announced that it\u2019s launched a skill on Google Assistant that allows you to control basic navigation and system-level commands on the console using the Google Assistant apps on iOS and Android. It sounds like something nobody needs, but don\u2019t knock it \u2018til you try it \u2014 it turns out that moving through your Xbox One hands-free is actually quite helpful.
