China, however, stressed that relations would not be normalized until Meng is released.\n\nMeng is currently out on bail, awaiting the start of her extradition hearing in January.", "description": "Top Chinese telecom executive Meng Wanzhou and her lawyers went to court on Monday to try to have her extradition case thrown out, arguing that her rights were violated.
