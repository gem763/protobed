The Nationals will start ace Max Scherzer on Tuesday and hope he goes as deep into the National League wild-card game as he possibly can. The Brewers will start Brandon Woodruff, their ace on the mend, and likely lift him after around 40 pitches \u2014 at which point the bullpen will become a revolving door. The Brewers match up with relievers as much as any team in baseball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically like we\u2019re starting in the sixth inning with their pitching staff,\u201d Nationals right fielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do to prepare for that.\u201d\n\nThe contrasting philosophies on display for the one-game playoff reflect the heart of these organizations. The Nationals, principally owned by the richest family in baseball, committed $525 million dollars to three starting pitchers \u2014 Stephen Strasburg, Patrick Corbin and Scherzer \u2014 and rode them here. The small-market Brewers cobbled together one of the sport\u2019s better bullpens on largely inexpensive deals and deployed it liberally to string together 20 wins in their last 24 games and eke into the postseason. The Brewers paid their entire pitching staff $39.2 million this season, according to Baseball Prospectus, which is only slightly more than Strasburg ($38.3 million) and Scherzer ($37.4 million) will earn this year alone.\n\nThe answer to which approach works best \u2014 quality or quantity \u2014 could play an outsized role in who advances to the National League Division Series against the top-seeded Los Angeles Dodgers. Both teams expressed confidence in their way, but Brewers Manager Craig Counsell didn\u2019t believe one was better.\n\n\u201cPlayoff teams should be different, I think that\u2019s cool,\u201d he said. \u201cTeams have to play to their strengths [and take advantage of their personnel]. . . . Our depth and our numbers are what makes our pitching good, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to treat games.\u201d\n\n[New York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight]\n\nIf Counsell had the Nationals\u2019 roster, he would manage accordingly. He called Scherzer a probable Hall of Famer and intimated that, if Woodruff were further along in his return from injury, he\u2019d probably lean more heavily on him, too. The Brewers\u2019 star right-hander tossed six scoreless innings against the Nationals in May, but he missed two months with an oblique strain and has thrown fewer than 40 pitches in each of his two starts since. Counsell seemed pessimistic Gio Gonzalez, a former National, could be available for the game because he started Saturday.\n\nWhether Scherzer can get into the sixth or seventh inning and deliver an ace-caliber start is unclear. He has been shaky since returning from injuries of his own \u2014 a balky back sidelined him for six weeks \u2014 though he has had eight starts since and feels 100 percent. Manager Dave Martinez will apparently afford him some leeway; he intimated Sunday he wouldn\u2019t lift his starter at the first sign of trouble.\n\nBut Scherzer could need relief early. If he does, Martinez must make hard decisions. He could go with regular relievers, who said they will be available from the first inning on, or Strasburg or Corbin. Even if this doesn\u2019t happen, the Brewers said they would feel more confident the longer Scherzer stays in.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s throwing well, he\u2019s obviously one of the best pitchers in the game,\u201d Brewers infielder Travis Shaw said. \u201cBut if you can get multiple shots at a pitcher, [no matter who it is], it benefits the hitter.\u201d\n\nNationals hitters stressed the key against the Brewers is to find a balance between aggressiveness and patience. Hitters often try to attack early against relievers because they know the pitcher has little margin for error and prioritizes efficiency to be available the next day. But when every pitcher functions like a reliever, they must weigh the usual approach against seeing more pitches and stressing top-shelf arms. Eaton sees his role in the lineup as a taxer, and he preached the need for balance. Early, hard-fought at-bats might force the Brewers to face difficult decisions.\n\n\u201cIf you can get some of their really good arms out of the way, I think it\u2019s only going to benefit us,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cPatience and grittiness will go a long way.\u201d\n\n[Max Scherzer\u2019s approach to his last 15 pitches explains everything about him]\n\nWhenever the Nationals go to the bullpen, they forfeit any advantage Scherzer might have given them. The Brewers\u2019 bullpen is a well-conditioned machine, refined by the fire of their playoff push. It features three versatile, dominant lefties in Josh Hader (one of baseball\u2019s toughest matchups for years), Brent Suter (National League reliever of the month for September) and Drew Pomeranz (a once-struggling starter who went to the bullpen and became Hader-lite.). Their top high-leverage right-handers are Junior Guerra and Jay Jackson.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 bullpen is still undefined. Washington doesn\u2019t have the left-handed specialist it acquired at the deadline (Roenis El\u00edas, out with a hamstring injury) and its relievers aren\u2019t locked into definite roles. Strasburg, seemingly the Nationals\u2019 first option in relief, has never appeared out of the bullpen. Their second choice, Corbin, has but not regularly in three years.\n\nFirst baseman Ryan Zimmerman acknowledged the Nationals must win this game to continue playing, and he believes Strasburg could get the job done, but he cautioned against changing habits developed over a six-month-long season. He joked: \u201cOh, just go out and get three outs in the big leagues against one of the better teams in one of the biggest moments, and it\u2019ll be exactly the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to be careful doing too much of that,\u201d he added. \u201cI think people get carried away with it and just assuming we\u2019re not humans. If you\u2019re used to doing something, it\u2019s hard to do it in that situation.\u201d\n\nCloser Sean Doolittle proposed normalizing the situation for starters-turned-relievers as much as possible by only using them to start innings. If Scherzer, for example, departed with two on and one out, let a reliever familiar in those spots \u201cclean that up.\u201d Doolittle emphasized he felt confident no matter what, that the team will have three pitchers who will receive Cy Young Award votes available, but it\u2019s all about what button to push and when.\n\n\u201cThese are the questions that you have to think about,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to use your strengths, but where is that line where you\u2019re putting somebody too far outside their comfort zone?\u201d\n\nThese are the questions with which the Nationals must grapple as their season hangs in the balance.", "description": "Washington will ride ace Max Scherzer as long as possible, while Milwaukee will move quickly to its deep bullpen.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XewiYxepNnJD-Q0wtY92c_Uzvoc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RDPAE5XDDII6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
