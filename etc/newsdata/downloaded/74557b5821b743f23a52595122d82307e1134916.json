Elizabeth Warren once touted as proof of her Native American roots has been deleted from her Twitter feed.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat started out the week by tweeting on the need to respect \u201cNative communities\u201d and by Wednesday her year-old tweet excoriating President Trump for \u201cattacks on our [family\u2019s] heritage\u201d was gone.\n\nThe deletion was first reported by The Washington Free Beacon.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party spotlighted the anniversary [of her tweet] with a blog post, calling the presidential candidate\u2019s revelation \u2018a spectacular failure to placate the criticism that she lied about her heritage. Warren took a DNA test and we learned this gem: She was 1/1024th Native American,\u2019 \u201d the website reported.\n\nMs. Warren previously scrubbed the video from her campaign website in August.\n\n\u201cNow, the president likes to call my mom a liar,\u201d the senator says in the video, which still exists on YouTube. \u201cWhat do the facts say.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native American ancestor in your pedigree,\u201d replies Dr. Carlos Bustamante, a professor of genetics at Stanford.\n\nIn March, however, Ms. Warren told CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d that she never should have identified as a Native American for the State Bar of Texas in 1986.\n\nWhy did you check those boxes, because obviously, that\u2019s a very small part of your lineage? 1/32nd or something, so why did you do it?\u201d David Axelrod asked. \u201cThe universities kind of fudged and used you for their own purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d the senator replied. \u201cI\u2019m not a person of color. I am not a citizen of a tribe, but what I try to do is be a good friend of Native Americans.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
