It took Janine Wiget of Z\u00fcrich and Katrin von Niederh\u00e4usern who now lives in Stockholm, a week to duplicate the segment, which covers 54 restaurants in 1 minute, 27 seconds, Biz New Orleans reported.\n\nThe side-by-side video created by the 30-year-old illustrators and graphic designers has attracted more than 1 million views since it was uploaded Aug. 23.\n\nTourism officials are delighted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s priceless,\u201d said Mark Romig, president and CEO of the New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corp. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put a value on something like this. Hats off to these two ladies who created an amazing impression-building piece of art.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It opens with Homer telling Lisa, \u201cAnd then you discover a thousand things you love about this city. Cajun crawfish. Lamb tagine \u2026\u201d and on and on.\n\nIn \u201cHomer, Katrin and Janine Eat their Way Through New Orleans,\u201d the women duplicate every action and camera angle. When Homer\u2019s mouth is stuffed with French fries, so is that of the woman imitating him. When he wiggles his fingers over a platter of crawfish and corn on the cob outside Bevi Seafood, so does she.\n\n\u201cHomer Simpson is a man with great charm, but not the best manners,\u201d said Wiget. \u201cTo get the right angles and positions, we had to sit on floors, lay on tables, eat with our hands and put a lot of shrimp and fries in our mouth, everything in front of the other restaurant guests.\u201d\n\nShe said she and von Niederh\u00e4usern, a friend since college, researched all the restaurants shown in the episode, mapped them and drew up a detailed storyboard. In New Orleans, they spent eight hours a day going restaurant to restaurant, ordering food, setting up shots and capturing them all with a single mobile phone and tripod.\n\n\u201cWhenever we talked to the managers, they laughed and let us do whatever we had to do,\u201d Wiget said. \u201cWe even had to convince one manager at Emeril\u2019s to let us set up a table right in front of the entrance door because the sign was on the door instead of on the window. While doing the project, we realized how proud New Orleanians are about their food culture and how honored the restaurants felt about being featured in The Simpsons episode.\u201d\n\nShe said they asked themselves several times what they were doing and why. \u201cBut when we watched the videos that we shot at night, and laughed a lot, we knew we just had to keep doing it. And it makes us so happy to see how many people from all around the world are enjoying watching it, too! So it was definitely worth all the work.\u201d\n\nTheir fans included Simpsons animator Eric Koenig, who wrote on their YouTube page that the video blew away people at The Simpsons Animation Studio. \u201cWe were absolutely stoked when The Simpsons creators reached out to us,\u201d said Wiget. \u201cThey didn\u2019t offer us jobs, but they invited us over to the studio and one of their table readings in L.A.\u201d\n\nShe said they spent about $500 just on food for the brief video. Betsy\u2019s Pancake House and Katie\u2019s Restaurant and Bar were so happy to be included they didn\u2019t charge for food, Wiget said.\n\nRomig said, \u201cThey made magic, and if they both ever come back to New Orleans I\u2019d gladly buy them a meal, or two.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Two Swiss women have recreated Homer Simpson's gourmandizing tour of New Orleans, snarf for snarf, finger-wiggle for finger-wiggle", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/simpsons-louisiana-new-orleans-tour.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
