This week, he will welcome his old teacher, Pope Francis, to see the chiselled granite altar from where he ministers.\n\nCatholic minister father Pedro Opeka meets children who are housed by his aid organisation at the Akamasoa community in Antananarivo, Madagascar, August 27, 2019. Picture taken August 27, 2019. REUTERS/Baz Ratner\n\nOpeka studied theology under the future pope in their native Argentina before dedicating his life to building communities for the families of Madagascar, one of the world\u2019s poorest nations.\n\n\u201cThe pope is coming to tell people to keep fighting for those who are forgotten,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pope will comfort them.\u201d\n\nOver the last 50 years, an organisation founded by Opeka has built homes for 25,000 people, 100 schools, six clinics and two football stadiums. Next year they will build a college for paramedics.\n\nMuch of the stone for the buildings is quarried just outside the capital city Antananarivo, from the huge granite pit where Opeka holds Mass for 10,000 people. Opeka, the son of a mason, refers to the pit as his cathedral.\n\n\u201cIn Europe a cathedral is built on the ground,\u201d the 71-year-old missionary said. \u201cAkamasoa cathedral was dug by hand.\u201d\n\nPope Francis, the 82-year-old leader of the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Roman Catholics, is visiting Mozambique, Madagascar and Mauritius during his six-day trip to Africa this week.\n\nOn Sept. 8, he will meet some of the families whose lives have been changed by Opeka, whose Slovenian parents fled to Argentina before he was born because the Communists tried to kill his father for being Christian.\n\nOpeka invited Francis to visit during a meeting at the Vatican last year, never dreaming that he would accept.\n\nRatsiory Fanomezanjanahary Tsiadino Fannie, a 13-year-old budding mathematician, lives in one of the homes Opeka has carved from the hillside and is due to meet Francis.\n\nHer pastel green house sits on one side of a leafy courtyard where she plays hopscotch with her six siblings, a stone\u2019s throw from Opeka\u2019s own house in the hillside neighbourhood of Akamasoa.\n\nAsked if she was looking forward to next week, she broke into a smile.\n\n\u201cThere will be my exams,\u201d Fannie said. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nFollowing a prod from her mother Erlinne, she gasped: \u201cOh yeah, the arrival of the pope as well? I\u2019m also ready for the arrival of the pope. I\u2019m really happy.\u201d\n\nErlinne, a single mother of four children, has also adopted her brother\u2019s two orphans, and taken in another child.\n\nStruggling to find work in the countryside, she moved to Akamasoa, one of the 20 neighbourhoods that Opeka\u2019s organisation helped build, with her children seven years ago.\n\nShe was given a house and a job in a school canteen. Her children are all studying.\n\n\u201cI, who was at the bottom at everything, will see my daughter talking to the pope,\u201d she said, tears welling up. \u201cMy heart is full of joy.\u201d\n\nBEAUTY FOR EVERYONE\n\nTrained by his father, Opeka built his first wall at 14 and his first home for the poor at 17. He joined a Catholic mission to Madagascar at 22, when he met 800 families living in and around Antananarivo\u2019s municipal rubbish dump. During sleepless nights, he prayed for guidance to ease their suffering.\n\n\u201cI heard people looking for help, shouting for it, but politicians didn\u2019t hear them,\u201d said Opeka. \u201cWe have to go where there is a need.\u201d\n\nA member of the Lazarist or Vincentian order of priests, founded to minister to the rural poor, he created the Akamasoa Association to build and run the villages using donations from around the world. His work has earned him the Legion of Honour, France\u2019s highest order of merit.\n\nThe straight-talking priest has no time for the bureaucracy and perks of many international aid agencies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to waste my time filling out paperwork,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can beat poverty and we have to beat poverty. Not with words, conferences, or international meetings, but with the poor.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nResidents of neighbourhoods built by the association earn around 50,000 ariary ($13) per week in exchange for breaking rocks by hand and building stone walls. They are given a house which they rent at a negligible rate, depending on their circumstances.\n\nThe neat rows of candy-coloured houses and cobblestone streets streak the hillside around the quarry, surrounded by dark pine trees.\n\n\u201cWe make our city beautiful,\u201d Opeka said firmly. \u201cBeauty is not a privilege for the rich.\u201d", "description": "Three times a year, Father Pedro Opeka celebrates Mass in a vast grey quarry in the hills above Madagascar's capital.
