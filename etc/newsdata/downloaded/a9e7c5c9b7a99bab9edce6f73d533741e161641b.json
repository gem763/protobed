REUTERS/Tami Chappell\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Disinformation campaigns helped lead to the assassination of Martin Luther King, the daughter of the U.S. civil rights champion said on Thursday after the head of Facebook said social media should not factcheck political advertisements.\n\nThe comments come as Facebook Inc (FB.O) is under fire for its approach to political advertisements and speech, which Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg defended on Thursday in a major speech that twice referenced King, known by his initials MLK.\n\nKing\u2019s daughter, Bernice, tweeted that she had heard the speech. \u201cI\u2019d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians. These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination,\u201d she wrote from the handle @BerniceKing.\n\nKing died of an assassin\u2019s bullet in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968.\n\nZuckerberg argued that his company should give voice to minority views and said that court protection for free speech stemmed in part from a case involving a partially inaccurate advertisement by King supporters. The U.S. Supreme Court protected the supporters from a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cPeople should decide what is credible, not tech companies,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to questions on Bernice King\u2019s statement.", "description": "Disinformation campaigns helped lead to the assassination of Martin Luther King, the daughter of the U.S. civil rights champion said on Thursday after the head of Facebook said social media should not factcheck political advertisements.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442077435&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G2AU", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
