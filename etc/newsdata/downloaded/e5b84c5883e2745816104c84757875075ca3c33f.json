If it ever gets before a judge, a judge might have to examine whether there was an objective basis for understanding what Maher had to say to be anything more than a joke.\n\nSTORY: 'Celebrity Apprentice': Omarosa on her 'Intimidated' Teammates and Why She Went After Lil Jon\n\nThe analysis was echoed by others including Dan Nabel at Greenberg Glusker, who also suggested that Trump might have to pay Maher's legal fees if the real estate magnate failed to overcome an early anti-SLAPP motion.\n\nTrump might attempt to avoid that fate by bringing the lawsuit in another state. Trump could also attempt a different theory on why Maher is liable, but in tweets at the time of the original lawsuit filing, Trump sounded quite confident of his chances of victory.\n\nAfter Trump sued, Maher fired back on his HBO show, Real Time.\n\n\"This is known as parody, and it's a form of something we in the comedy business call a joke,\" Maher said. \"Just like we're the gun country, we're the joke country. We love our free speech and we love celebrities getting taken down a peg. So Don, just suck it up like everybody else.\"\n\nTwitter: @eriqgardner", "description": "The \"Celebrity Apprentice\" star will reportedly re-file a claim that the \"Real Time\" host owes $5 million for an \"offer\" made on NBC's \"Tonight Show.\"", "authors": ["Eriq Gardner", "Eriq.Gardner Thr.Com"], "top_image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2013/02/donald_trump_bill_maher_a_l.jpg", "published_at": "2013-04-03"}
