When you\u2019re the 11th-generation family CEO, steering a ship that was launched in 1756, consider both amplified.\n\nThat\u2019s the position Maximilian Riedel found himself in when he assumed the role six years ago, returning from a 15-year stint in New York, where he ran the business\u2019 U.S. operation, to the company\u2019s headquarters in Kufstein, Austria, and taking the reins from his father, Georg.\n\nReidel is a luxury wine glass manufacturer, best known for its varietal specific glassware. The company produces fine-tuned glasses with different shapes and designs to showcase different types of wine, whether an un-oaked Chardonnay or a Cabernet Sauvignon, for instance. The concept revolutionized the wine drinking industry when originally introduced in the mid-20th Century.\n\nUnder Maximilian\u2019s leadership, new developments include the 2018 debut of the Performance series\u2014glasses with a series of fine ridges resulting in an inner surface substantially larger than its exterior surface. The interior ridges uniquely boost the wine\u2019s aroma, while the overall shape of the glass remains the same.\n\nOf course, varietal specific glassware remains the Riedel calling card. \u201cOur job is to show the character of the wine,\u201d Maximilian Riedel, 42, says. \u201cThis has been the fuel for our success for two generations.\u201d\n\nRiedel spoke with Penta about the history and future of his family\u2019s company, along with some of his latest innovations and partnerships, Riedel\u2019s foray into the cocktail world, and more.\n\nPENTA : You\u2019re the 11th generation from your family in charge of your namesake company. What does it mean to you to maintain that sense of legacy and tradition, one that stretches back over 250 years?\n\nMaximilian Riedel: The theme is that we never look back, we always want to look ahead. I see myself as a contributor to the legacy but not the point of focus or attention. I\u2019m the man who's running the business, but I\u2019m just one of a few runners who run this kind of marathon and the code must be, and always has been, not to be the last one, and to pass on the baton to the next generation.\n\nI\u2019m sitting in this seat, and know that I\u2019m sitting in this seat temporarily, because the dream and the goal must be to pass it on to the next generation. I think if you have done this and accomplished this, then besides being a good father, and a good mentor, then also you had a business sense that allowed you to be who you are, that you are creative, innovative and a successful businessman. That\u2019s what it means to me. Being the 11th generation means to be in my situation temporarily to pass it on to the next generation.\n\nYou\u2019ve been a leading advocate for ditching the Champagne flute in favor of a tailored wine glass. Why?\n\nMy philosophy is that you should never serve Champagne in a flute. The advantage of the flute was, No. 1, all in marketing. There\u2019s nothing in the world that you drink out of a flute otherwise. It doesn\u2019t serve the purpose of Champagne, which is still to me the best wine ever made. It tends to only showcase the yeast, as opposed to the fruit and bright aromas.\n\nAll of this motivated me to take a stand and change the way people drink Champagne. I developed this on my own, and now of course everyone has copied it. We also call it a Champagne wine glass, so people realize that Champagne is wine and treat it in the same way.\n\nRiedel headquarters in Kufstein, Austria. Jake Emen\n\nRiedel is also now producing cocktail glassware built to meet a variety of applications. Tell me about why and how you decided to make this move.\n\nCocktails use terms and language that I don\u2019t speak. I don\u2019t know how to mix a cocktail, I don\u2019t have a clue. I\u2019m a wine guy, and that\u2019s what has made us successful for generations. So we needed a professional on whose wings we could fly.\n\nWith wine glasses, what we do is we create for a specific characteristic. As all cocktails are different though, we ultimately decided to base our glassware on different categories of cocktails as well as the ice which may be used, as opposed to a particular flavor note. We launched first in the U.S., and now it\u2019s a new leg for us to stand on.\n\nRiedel has participated in numerous partnerships with storied brands in the wine world, as well as the beverage world at large, from Nespresso to Coca-Cola. What stands out to you as one of your favorites?\n\nI think a great company to align with is LVMH. We\u2019ve done more glasses with them than for any other company. For instance, we did a Krug ros\u00e9 glass with them, in the new Performance collection.\n\nRecently we also did the new Ao Yun glass with LVMH, which is the wine from the Himalayas, grown at an altitude of over 2,500 meters. It\u2019s a challenging project, and if anyone could pull it off, it\u2019s LVMH. There\u2019s a great story behind this brand, behind this wine.\n\nThey pulled us in from the very beginning. After three vintages they asked us to make a glass that stands out, that\u2019s very unique, that represents their philosophy of Ao Yun. That was one of the most exciting projects, especially being there early on and assisting as they seek to find their house style.\n\nAs you look to the future, how else do you see Riedel adapting and evolving?\n\nI have great hopes that my material of glass will become even more popular again. The generations prior to me, in the 18th and 19th century, when they produced glass, they produced value. Glass was based on knowledge and raw materials which were very expensive. It was reserved for the church, royal families, and wealthy people. It changed completely in the modern era, of course, and quality has faded away in favor of affordability and availability.\n\nNow the biggest competitor of glass as a material is plastic. And thanks to Greta [Thunberg, the teenage climate activist], and just the human mind of the next generation, such as my kids, plastic has a very bad aftertaste, so to speak. Europe is gearing up to ban it in certain ways, where it\u2019s possible, and for the sake of the environment hopefully more countries including America follow behind as well.\n\nI see a big opportunity in this. We banned lead in our product in 2015, we are lead free. We produce fine crystal. We\u2019re recyclable. There\u2019s more of a green footprint. So I have the perfect set up to survive in the future, because people will look to glass again for a wider range of applications, as a container, for transportation, for safety, et cetera, which isn\u2019t there right now. So I see potential in all of this.\n\nWhen you\u2019re at home, what are you drinking?\n\nJust go to my account on Instagram and you can see what I do and what I drink and how I drink it. And what repeats itself constantly on there is two grape varieties: Cabernet and Pinot Noir. I\u2019m more of a red wine drinker, and if I must pick, more of a Cabernet drinker than a Pinot Noir drinker.", "description": "The 11th generation of his family to run the company is focused on the future", "authors": ["Jake Emen"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-116743/social", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
