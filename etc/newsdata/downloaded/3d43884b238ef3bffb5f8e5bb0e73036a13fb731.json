(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nMIAMI \u2014 The best illustration of how the Washington Nationals manage injuries by balancing a long view with their short-term goals is their approach with veteran catcher Kurt Suzuki.\n\nSuzuki has been out for nearly two weeks with inflammation in his throwing elbow. He is the team\u2019s top catcher \u2014 and the regular partner of ace Max Scherzer and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez \u2014 and the club could really use his bat in the thick of this pennant race. But Suzuki, 35, doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize his future by coming back too fast. He doesn\u2019t expect to feel 100 percent; very few players do this late in the season. But there are several factors to consider regarding his next steps.\n\nHe tried throwing from 60 feet at Marlins Park on Friday, and his elbow felt fine in the morning. That was a good sign, and in turn, he was available to pinch-hit when the Nationals faced the Marlins on Saturday. It\u2019s going to take more than that, though, for Suzuki to be convinced he\u2019s ready for his usual role.\n\n[Boswell: Playoff chases are fun, aren\u2019t they, Nats fans? Why are you hiding under your desk?]\n\n\u201cShoot, I\u2019m 35 years old. I\u2019m going to be 36. If I get hurt, knock on wood, it\u2019s not going to be just a little rest thing,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cWhen guys hurt their elbow and they have to get surgery, they\u2019re out for a year or so. You don\u2019t want to do that at this point of my career.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019m going to have the opportunity to get to the playoffs. It is kind of that fine line where you\u2019ve got to kind of balance it out.\u201d\n\nThis is very similar to what the Nationals are weighing with their other injured players. Washington doesn\u2019t want to further jeopardize their health by pushing them back onto the field prematurely. But the team also has nine games left in the regular season and could well be playing in the National League wild-card game Oct. 1.\n\nMatt Adams is working back from a left shoulder strain and took on-field batting practice for the second consecutive day. Roenis El\u00edas is recovering from his second right hamstring strain in as many months and is still regaining strength.\n\nWithout Suzuki, Yan Gomes has caught in all but one of the Nationals\u2019 past 12 games. Without Suzuki and Adams, the Nationals\u2019 bench is a lot thinner than it was in August. Without El\u00edas, Sean Doolittle is the only left-handed reliever in Washington\u2019s bullpen. Each of them knows the urgency required in September. And each of them is being closely monitored by the club\u2019s training staff so no mistakes are made.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the plan now,\u201d Suzuki said of possibly returning before he is at full strength. \u201cIt\u2019s just getting to a point where I can play. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s 100 percent now at this time of the year, no matter if they\u2019re healthy or not. Right now it\u2019s just a matter of getting healthy enough to be able to go out there and play.\u201d\n\nLINEUPS\n\nNationals (84-68)\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nStephen Strasburg P\n\nMarlins (53-100)\n\nMagneuris Sierra CF\n\nMiguel Rojas SS\n\nNeil Walker 1B\n\nStarlin Castro 3B\n\nIsan Diaz 2B\n\nHarold Ramirez RF\n\nAustin Dean LF\n\nBryan Holaday C\n\nJordan Yamamoto P\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nIn Marlins, the Nationals find a cure for any pennant-race jitters\n\nHow Daniel Hudson became the Nationals\u2019 most important reliever\n\nSean Doolittle has struggled to rediscover what made him successful.
