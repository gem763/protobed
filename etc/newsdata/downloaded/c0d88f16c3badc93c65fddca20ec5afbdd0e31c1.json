These lifetime-appointed judges understand their modest, but critical, role is interpreting the law as written \u2014 not how the judges wish it were written, if they were senators. Senator Lindsey Graham(R-SC) has served as one of the President\u2019s key wing-men in this historic, consequential effort.\n\nThe confirmation of conservative judges played a critical role in Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. After the death of the-late Justice Antonin Scalia, a lion of the law, candidate Trump promised to appoint judges in the mold of Scalia. In an unprecedented move, President Trump released a list of potential nominees who he would appoint to the Supreme Court. He has kept that promise as president, with the appointments of Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. Of the 26 names on his Supreme Court list, President Trump has appointed 9 of those to the federal lower courts.\n\nSince the President took office, the Senate has confirmed 156 new Article III judges, including Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and an all-time record 43 circuit judges appointed to the critically important federal courts of appeals. Senator Graham assumed a leading role during the fight to confirm Justice Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. He refused to allow the leftist mob to sink Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination based on an 11th-hour smear campaign. Senator Graham said this during the September 27th hearing: \u201cI hope you're on the Supreme Court, that's exactly where you should be. And I hope that the American people will see through this charade. And I wish you well. And I intend to vote for you and I hope everybody who's fair-minded will.\u201d Thanks in big part to Lindsey Graham\u2019s epic speech, Justice Kavanaugh is indeed on the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter the Kavanaugh fight, Graham\u2019s approval rating shot up to 74 percent among Republican voters. President Trump carried South Carolina in 2016 by 14 percent. Recent polling showsGraham beating his Democrat challenger by 17 points.\n\nYet, Mr. Graham\u2019s opponent voiced opposition to Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, calling it \u201cthe biggest ruse on the American people.\u201d The people of South Carolina clearly don\u2019t want a Chuck Schumer loyalist representing them in Washington.\n\nIt is very important that we have senators who will fairly consider -- and not mindlessly obstruct -- President Trump\u2019s next Supreme Court nominee. Senator Lindsey Graham didn\u2019t allow the liberal mob to toss out due process during the Kavanaugh hearings. He played a key role in ensuring that Judge Kavanaugh became Justice Kavanaugh. Now, he continues to lead the Senate Judiciary Committee as the Republican senators work tirelessly to confirm President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees to our federal courts \u2014 over fierce, mindless Democrat opposition. This is clearly one of President Trump\u2019s greatest legacies. Thanks in big part to Senator Graham\u2019s leadership, President Trump is making the courts great again.\n\nMike Davis is the founder and president of The Article III Project (A3P).
