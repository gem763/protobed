A small cut in the deposit rate is widely expected. The key question is whether Mr Draghi will go out with a bang and restart the bond-buying program? There also some suggestions about the ECB introducing a tiering system in which a portion of banks' excess deposits parked at the ECB are exempt from 0.4% negative interest rates (i.e. exempt from paying the ECB for depositing their excess reserve). If introduced, this should help to boost banks\u2019 profit. So, watch bank stocks closely today!\n\nDaily % Candles\n\nToday\u2019s other focal point will be the latest US CPI inflation report, which should impact both the dollar and buck-denominated precious metals.

Trump also said he is making plans to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the UN meeting later this month. Oil prices fell sharply on the back of this, as a meeting between the two would be the first step towards easing sanctions on Iran.\n\nWm.
