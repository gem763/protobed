Furor Ensues.", "language": "en", "text": "State District Judge Tammy Kemp gives former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger a hug before Guyger leaves for jail, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, in Dallas. Guyger, who said she mistook neighbor Botham Jean's apartment for her own and fatally shot him in his living room, was sentenced to a decade in prison. (Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP, Pool)\n\nThe trial was over at last. After days of emotional testimony in a case that gripped and divided the nation, a white former Dallas police officer had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for murdering a black man in his own apartment. The shouts of protest that had filled the courthouse hallways had quieted. Everyone was getting ready to go home.\n\nBut the judge was not done.\n\nAfter speaking with and hugging the victim\u2019s parents, the judge, Tammy Kemp, returned to the courtroom with her personal Bible in hand. She gifted it to the officer, Amber R. Guyger, and pointed to John 3:16, a passage about salvation.\n\nThen, as the woman convicted of murder reached out her arms, the judge, still in her black robe and pearled necklace, wrapped her in an embrace.\n\nSome saw the striking moment between a black female judge and a white former officer as an extraordinary example of humanity; others have criticized it as inappropriate, biased and potentially unconstitutional.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, a national group that fights to defend the separation of church and state, filed a complaint with the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct, arguing that the judge\u2019s \u201cproselytizing\u201d amounted to an ethics violation. \u201cCompassion,\u201d the group wrote in their complaint, \u201ccrossed the line into coercion.\u201d\n\nCritics have also questioned whether a black defendant would have been shown the same compassion. African Americans are more likely than white people to be arrested, convicted and given stiff sentences, according to research by the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for criminal justice reform.\n\nChristopher Scott, a black man who spent nearly 13 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, said he had never received a hug from a judge in all his experiences with the criminal justice system, including at his exoneration hearing in Dallas County in 2009.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched all of the exonerations that happened in Dallas County \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen it,\u201d said Scott, who went on to found an organization that investigates other wrongful crimes. \u201cWe don\u2019t get handshakes; we don\u2019t get hugs; we don\u2019t get Bibles. They just say, \u2018We\u2019re sorry for what happened to you, and you are a free man to go.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTy Toney, who followed the trial from his home in Las Vegas, was among those who viewed the judge\u2019s actions as commendable. \u201cI watch a lot of these trials because it\u2019s kind of personal to me,\u201d said Toney, 40, who said his brother was killed in a police shooting in California in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cTo take the effort and go out there and console somebody, that touched me,\u201d said Toney, a practicing Lutheran. \u201cPeople can be mad at the sentencing, the time she was given, but that\u2019s different than showing compassion for another human.\u201d\n\nKemp, a former prosecutor who was elected to the bench as a Democrat in 2014, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThough judges are often thought of as impassive gavel-pounders, Kemp is not alone in showing compassion toward the defendant and victims before her.\n\nJudges who run court diversion programs meant to help defendants overcome issues like drug addiction often openly root for them to find a better life. When the cases are dismissed, the courtroom can feel more like a graduation than a conclusion to a criminal case. A judge in Brooklyn, New York, has occasionally ended low-level cases with handshakes or hugs for nearly two decades.\n\nBut few could recall a similar scenario in a high-profile murder trial like Guyger\u2019s, which was unusual from the start. Guyger fatally shot her neighbor, Botham Shem Jean, in his apartment last year, claiming she mistook the apartment for her own and Jean for an intruder. To the contrary, a judge last year denied Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the drug lord known as El Chapo, from hugging his own wife.\n\nAmanda Frost, a professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law, said the judge\u2019s decision to hug Guyger was not too far removed from judges who tell defendants that they regret being forced by the law to hand down a certain sentence or who encourage them to reconsider their paths.\n\n\u201cImpartiality is what matters,\u201d Frost said. \u201cIf the judge shows it throughout the trial and then shows some compassion to the defendant afterward, I don\u2019t have a problem with that.\u201d\n\nThe Bible, on the other hand, was \u201cquestionable,\u201d Frost said.", "description": "The trial was over at last.
