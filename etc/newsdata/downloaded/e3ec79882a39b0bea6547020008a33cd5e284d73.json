The two performers start moving in unison, identical except for the fact one of them is wearing a grey top and skirt, while the other is totally starkers. It seems like a provocation, but that\u2019s not what this piece is about at all.\n\nIn fact, it was more of an afterthought. Originally, Guerin had assumed that since the dancers were doing the same thing, she\u2019d dress them in the same outfits. But when it came to designing the costumes, she realised that wasn\u2019t right. The piece evolved in her Melbourne studio and the choreographer began to see the two dancers as representing two sides of the same person. She tried various ways of characterising them \u2013 one in a unitard, one in office clothes \u2013 then alighted on the idea of no clothes at all.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Split by Lucy Guerin.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked the dancer, Lilian Steiner, she just burst out laughing \u2013 slightly hysterically, I think,\u201d says Guerin. \u201cBut she said, if that\u2019s the right thing for the work then I want to try it. When we closed all the curtains and tried it, it seemed to reinforce this idea of the public and private self I\u2019d been thinking about. And because Lilian is completely unselfconscious, it just felt like she was doing her work as a dancer, it wasn\u2019t about being a victim or being sexual, it felt like a strong statement for a female body, so I really liked that.\u201d\n\nGuerin admits that nudity on stage is \u201cfraught\u201d, especially female nudity, and \u201cas the person who has the power,\u201d she felt uncomfortable asking Steiner to do it. But after getting used to it, Steiner enjoys the feeling.\n\nFor the audience, the effect is striking. After a few minutes you don\u2019t really see the nakedness any more, but you do see the clean geometry of unclad limbs and the divide between the two dancers. Even when their moves are matching, there are all sorts of potential stories and power-plays evolving.\n\nNudity aside, the real concept of Split \u2013 which came to Guerin in the shower \u2013 is based on a pleasingly simple idea. After the first 20 minutes, the dancers bisect the stage, laying down gaffer tape and restricting their performing area to one half. Ten minutes later, they halve the stage again, then again after five minutes, and so on, until the two have taped themselves into a corner, with barely room for four feet. The space becomes ever more claustrophobic and their once harmonious movements ever more fractious.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Macbeth in collaboration with Carrie Cracknell at the Young Vic in 2015.

Like about someone\u2019s partner dying and what that was like, very personal things.\u201d\n\nThe simplicity of the structure, and its readability, seems to liberate audiences. \u201cFor a lot of people, that clarity makes them feel comfortable \u2013 they feel safe and it lets other thoughts, produced by the dancing, come up,\u201d says Guerin. \u201cI find sometimes people are very confused by contemporary dance and they\u2019re often wondering: what is it? But something about the framing in Split seemed to let them into the dance.\u201d\n\nGuerin has been making dance for 20 years, but very little of the Australian choreographer\u2019s work has actually been seen in the UK. Most recently she collaborated with theatre director Carrie Cracknell on productions of Medea at the National Theatre and Macbeth at the Young Vic, and made a danced deconstruction of the latter play, called Tomorrow, for Rambert.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A strong statement for a female body ...

Much of Guerin\u2019s own dance career took place in New York, where there was still a great influence of the postmodern choreographers of the Judson Church. In the decades since, she has watched trends come and go, moving from postmodern to conceptual dance, from a focus on physical technique to dancers giving up going to daily class altogether. In Australia, she says, \u201cPeople are coming back to class and they seem keen to move. Although I walk past the rehearsal rooms in my studio and the dancer is often sitting there working on their laptop,\u201d she laughs.\n\nEven dance cannot escape the shift to the digital world, it seems, but Guerin values the importance of \u201cthinking through the body\u201d, of getting up and doing. Not all her experiments will end up on stage. The early weeks of Split involved \u201ca lot of time with a big roll of cellophane and dancers inside plastic bags, and learning lots of cartoon movement off YouTube, like Bugs Bunny\u201d. But in the end she came back to the fundamentals of choreography: time, space, movement and the body, in its starkest form.", "description": "In Lucy Guerin\u2019s show Split, two performers \u2013 one clothed, one not \u2013 slowly trap themselves into a corner", "authors": ["Lyndsey Winship"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47471d3c55614951181571b4edeead5127aa9a1d/0_87_2931_1759/master/2931.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e53c90f63a9755f8788b76bde41f21f", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
