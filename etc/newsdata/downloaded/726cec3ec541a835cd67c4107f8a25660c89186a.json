A male-female team performed the required task at a later date.\n\nThe failure by traditionally male-dominated NASA to be adequately prepared was denounced in some quarters as evidence of implicit sexism.\n\nWhen Koch and Meir had been outside the space station for about five hours, President Donald Trump reached them in a video call and told them they had made history.\n\n\u201cYou are very brave, brilliant women,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cYou represent this country so well,\u201d the president added. \u201cWe are very proud of you.\u201d\n\nMeir, a 42-year-old marine biologist who was recruited by NASA in 2013, answered by paying tribute to female pioneers of the past.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female spacewalkers before us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a long line of female scientists, explorers, engineers and astronauts. We have followed in their footsteps, to get to where we are today.\u201d\n\nAfter the call, the astronauts got back to their repair work.\n\n\u201cThat is a view,\u201d one of them \u2014 it was not clear which \u2014 said at one point, as the earth was lit up in bright light from the sun.\n\nKoch, an electrical engineer who is leading the mission, was carrying out her fourth spacewalk and was hooked up to the station\u2019s robotic arm.\n\nMeir, making her first spacewalk, carefully made her way using handles.\n\nThe two were working to replace a faulty battery charge/discharge unit, known as a BCDU.\n\nThe station relies on solar power but is out of direct sunlight for much of its orbit and therefore needs batteries. The BCDUs regulate the amount of charge that goes into them.\n\nThe current task was announced Monday and is part of a wider mission of replacing aging nickel-hydrogen batteries with higher-capacity lithium-ion units.\n\n\u2013 Artemis \u2013\n\nThe US sent its first female astronaut into space in 1983, when Sally Ride took part in the seventh space shuttle mission, and has now had more women astronauts than any other country.\n\nBut the first woman in space was Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova in 1963, followed by compatriot Svetlana Savitskaya in 1982, who was also the first woman spacewalker two years later.\n\nNASA acting associate administrator Ken Bowersox said he hoped that an all-female spacewalk would soon be a \u201croutine\u201d matter that would not require celebration.\n\nAsked why it had taken so long \u2014 Meir is the 14th US woman spacewalker \u2014 he said men\u2019s added height provided an advantage.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of spacewalks where very tall men were the ones that were able to do the jobs because they were able to reach and do things a little bit more easily,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris said the spacewalk was more than historic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that for women, even the sky doesn\u2019t have to be the limit,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nNASA plans to return to the Moon by 2024 for the first time since the Apollo landings of 1969-1972. The new mission is named Artemis, after the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology.\n\nThe mission will likely see the first woman set foot on the lunar surface, perhaps as part of a male-female combination, as the space agency looks ahead to a crewed Mars expedition in the 2030s.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir on Friday became the first all-female pairing to carry out a spacewalk \u2014 a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/06acb2_image-nasa-tv-shows-astronaut-christina-koch-spacewalk-international-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
