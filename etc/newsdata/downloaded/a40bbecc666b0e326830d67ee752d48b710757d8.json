Kaine: Congress \u2018Taking Back from the White House the Power to Declare War Is Absolutely Critical\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Tuesday during an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), the 2016 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Northern Syria on several levels. However, he did say there was one action Congress should consider when it comes to war powers.\n\n\u201cFirst, let\u2019s talk about just in the last couple of weeks what\u2019s happened with ISIS,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cAll of the U.S. advice to President Trump is if you pull these troops out, ISIS is going to reconstitute. So what threat do we have there? Second, what message does it send when the U.S. pulls our troops away from people who have fought side-by-side with our troops on the battlefield? You see the deep disappointment in the Kurds feeling like we\u2019ve abandoned them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd for President Trump to say actually, you know what, we\u2019re not going to pull our troops completely out of Syria \u2014 we\u2019ll protect oil fields, but we won\u2019t protect the Kurds who fought side-by-side with our troops \u2014 that\u2019s deeply disturbing. And then the last question, which is the big one is if you abandon the Kurds now, what ally is going to trust the United States in the future when we need to battle terrorism, when we need to battle threats?\u201d he continued. \u201cWho\u2019s going to be our ally if they think we\u2019re going to walk away from them?\u201d\n\nKaine remarked on how the image was also bad for U.S. troops. However, he later acknowledged it is Congress that should be responsible for declaring war in this circumstance and said the authorization from 2001 was not sufficient.\n\n\u201cI introduced \u2014 actually, I think it was in September or October of 2014, a specific anti-ISIS authorization for military force in Syria,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cI recognize that we need to battle ISIS and make sure they\u2019re defeated. But I don\u2019t think the vote that Congress cast in September of 2001 really covers the wide engagements the U.S. has all over the world. So I do think Congress owning \u2014 taking back from the White House the power to declare war is absolutely critical.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Tuesday during an appearance on CNN's \"New Day,\" Sen.
