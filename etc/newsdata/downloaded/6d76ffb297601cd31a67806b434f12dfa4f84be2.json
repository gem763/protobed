Trysta Krick reacts to all the biggest games and moments from a wild weekend in the NFL. USA TODAY\n\nThese players saw their fantasy values increase or decrease most based on their performances in Week 5:\n\nSizzlers\n\nRB Aaron Jones, Green Bay Packers: With backfield mate Jamaal Williams sidelined by a concussion, Jones carried the ball 19 times for 107 yards and scored four times against Dallas. He also tacked on seven receptions for 75 more yards.\n\nRB Josh Jacobs, Oakland Raiders: If his 143 combined yards and two touchdowns wasn't impressive enough, he put up those numbers against a tough Chicago Bears defense. Jacobs showed his leaping ability by going up and over the pile at the goal line for the winning score.\n\nWR Will Fuller, Houston Texans: The Atlanta Falcons had no answer for Fuller as he put up a career-high 217 yards receiving and scored three touchdowns. Fuller was tackled twice on the 1-yard-line in the game, which could have boosted his astronomical fantasy point total even higher.\n\nWR Michael Thomas, New Orleans Saints: Without Drew Brees at the helm, fantasy owners were concerned Thomas would not be able to continue producing at his usual pace. Not to worry. He caught 11 of 13 targets Sunday from backup quarterback Teddy Bridgewater for 182 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\n\nWR Amari Cooper, Dallas Cowboys: The Packers secondary had been stingy until Cooper caught 11 passes for 226 yards and a touchdown. He was wide open much of the night as Green Bay couldn't cover him. Expect more of the same against the New York Jets.\n\nFANTASY FOOTBALL: Valuable advice to help your team dominate\n\nFizzlers\n\nRB Wayne Gallman, New York Giants: After a well-rounded rushing and receiving game the week before, Gallman was derailed by a first quarter concussion. He's questionable this week, and Saquon Barkley is just about ready to return to action.\n\nWR Mike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: For the first time in his career, Evans had an empty stat line, failing to bring in any of his three targets in a loss to the Saints. It won't get much easier this week as Evans travels to London for a tough matchup against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nWR Emmanuel Sanders, Denver Broncos: The game script and offensive plan just didn't flow Sanders' way as the Broncos kept the ball on the ground. With Courtland Sutton receiving so much attention in the passing game, it will take matchups against weaker secondaries for Sanders to benefit.\n\nWR Marquez Valdes-Scantling, Green Bay Packers: Even with star receiver Davante Adams unable to dress for the game, Valdes-Scantling managed just one reception for 18 yards. He just might be one of those complementary players who seems to struggle when thrust into a primary role.\n\nTE Greg Olsen, Carolina Panthers: Olsen does not seem to be the same security blanket for Kyle Allen as he is for Cam Newton. Olsen did not catch a pass against Jacksonville and his involvement in the game plan is uncertain from week to week.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
