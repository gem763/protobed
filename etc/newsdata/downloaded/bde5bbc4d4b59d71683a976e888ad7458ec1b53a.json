Ted Cruz, R-Texas, became one of the few Republican lawmakers to publicly criticize President Trump over his call for China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Cruz said when asked a question on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d regarding Trump\u2019s request to China to open a probe into the Biden family\u2019s business dealings in the country. Biden is one of the leading Democratic presidential primary candidates and one who may serve as Trump's biggest threat in 2020.\n\n\u201cElections in the U.S. should be decided by Americans, and it's not the business of foreign countries, any foreign countries, to be interfering in our elections,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nTRUMP SAYS OBAMA 'HIDING' FROM QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDENS AND UKRAINE: 'I THINK HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT'\n\nTrump said this month at the White House that \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d He said he hadn\u2019t previously asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter, but it\u2019s \u201ccertainly something we could start thinking about.\u201d\n\nBy publicly egging on China, Trump was amplifying the message he\u2019d delivered in private to the president of Ukraine. That message, revealed by a government whistleblower, has spawned the impeachment investigation by the House.\n\nTrump, who has defended his contact with Ukraine as \u201cperfect,\u201d went further in expanding his request to China, a communist world power that has much at stake in its relationship with the United States in an ongoing trade war.\n\nThe boldness of Trump\u2019s call Thursday also suggests he will continue to act as though requests for other countries to investigate potential opponents in the 2020 election are normal, even in the face of broad condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans. It\u2019s a tactic Trump has used successfully before, pushing questionable secret conversations into the open, helping to inoculate him against charges that he is engaged in nefarious action, cover-ups or obstruction of justice.\n\nTRUMP BELITTLES BIDENS WITH GRAPHIC LANGUAGE AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY, AS CHAOS UNFOLDS OUTSIDE ARENA\n\nIn the case of both Ukraine and China, Trump has made his allegations against Biden without evidence of any wrongdoing.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments have rankled some Republican lawmakers and put them in a difficult situation should the House vote to impeach the president.\n\nWhile many GOP senators have deflected or downplayed Trump\u2019s words, Cruz did not hold back on Sunday, adamantly asserting that \u201cforeign countries should stay out of\u201d U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cThat's true for Russia, that's true for Ukraine, that's true for China, that's true for all of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be the American people deciding elections.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump over the weekend continued to lash out at the Bidens \u2013 specifically targeting Hunter Biden Sunday morning in a tweet and implying that he had disappeared. Trump\u2019s tweet came hours after Hunter Biden's attorney announced his client is stepping down from the board of a Chinese company and vowed that he will not work with foreign companies if his father becomes president.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter? He has totally disappeared!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNow looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.\u201d Trump did not elaborate on which countries, or what the alleged scams were.\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Sen.
