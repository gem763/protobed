Samsung is committed to offering innovative mobile experience and will continue to explore better mobile productivity.\"\n\nThe company started a private beta for the project back in November. The private beta allowed Linux to open in select Galaxy devices in DeX mode.\n\nSamsung DeX allows users to connect their smartphones or tablets with monitors to simulate a desktop like experience. It was initially offered as a docking station for phones but users can now directly connect their devices to monitors via a USB-C cable.\n\nSamsung is expecting a profit drop of 56% for the third quarter of this year due to a downturn in the memory market. Its mobile business, however, is expected to have a return to form with the release of its Galaxy Note 10.\n\nIt's not all good news for the company's mobile business though, as it was revealed last week that the ultrasonic fingerprint readers on Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 devices could be bypassed through a silicone screen cover.\n\nSamsung has promised it would roll out a software update to fix the problem sometime next week.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "Samsung is shutting down its Linux on DeX projects after only 11 months.", "authors": ["Cho Mu-Hyun"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/09/04508749-f9d9-406f-ab56-86ebeb1dba7d/thumbnail/770x578/a05ce6e4b62fbdbabf56b926200af3f1/samsung-linux-on-dex.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
