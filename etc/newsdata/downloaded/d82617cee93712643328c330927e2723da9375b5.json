Trump, though, insists on going by \u201cDonald\u201d in his public-facing life rather than the more familiar \u201cDon\u201d or his childhood \u201cDonny.\u201d Using one\u2019s diminutive name is actually extremely common in American politics \u2014 think Bill (William) Clinton, Jimmy (James) Carter, Al (Albert) Gore, Bernie (Bernard) Sanders. Trump, though, shuns informality in a rare deviation from the norm (his preferred address is the even-more-removed \u201cMr. Trump\u201d).\n\nJokes about Trump\u2019s preoccupation with his size have varied in politeness over the years, but have seemingly always been around. Trump\u2019s obsession with both his perceived and literal physical stature, though, are most nakedly on display when he bristles at insults directed at his hands. Former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter has claimed that after he described Trump as a \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d in Spy Magazine in 1988, the real-estate investor turned reality-TV host would periodically send Carter photos of himself with \u201chis hand [circled] in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers.\u201d Trump has continued to publicly press that his hands are actually bigger than normal, telling The Washington Post in a 2016 interview that they\u2019re \u201cslightly large, actually,\u201d as well as informing Hurricane Harvey victims in 2017 that his hands were too big to fit the plastic gloves provided to pass out sandwiches.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jeva Lange", "Theweek.Com Articles Why-Little-Most-Brutal-Insult-Trump-Imagine"], "top_image": ""}
