West has increasingly and publicly expressed devotion to Christianity, and reportedly claims he\u2019s stepping away from making \u201csecular music.\u201d\n\n\u201cI now have given my life to Jesus Christ, and I work for God,\u201d West said during a surprise appearance Thursday night on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBelow is everything to know about the album, which you can listen to below:\n\nDelays\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for musicians to tease release dates, only for the deadlines to come and go. This is especially true for West, who famously failed to deliver the \u201cYandhi\u201d album he promised last year. In August, West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian West, tweeted a purported track list for \u201cJesus Is King\u201d with a projected release date of Sept. 27.\n\nAD\n\nAfter a few instances of false hope, fans grew excited when West, whose social media presence is intermittent at best, tweeted Thursday night that the long-delayed \u201cJesus Is King\u201d would drop at midnight. But 12 a.m. came and went with no new album. Just after 1 a.m. Eastern time, West thanked his fans for their patience in a tweet, noting that he and his team were \u201cspecifically fixing mixes\u201d on three forthcoming tracks: \u201cEverything We Need,\u201d \u201cFollow God\u201d and \u201cWater.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, West was creating buzz in New York. On \u201cKimmel,\u201d which is taping in Brooklyn this week and aired at 12:05 a.m., the rapper said of his album, with a sheepish grin, \u201cOh, it\u2019s out now.\u201d And eagle-eyed Twitter users spotted West navigating a mysterious setup at the World Trade Center\u2019s Oculus transportation hub, where it seemed as though the rapper was preparing for something.\n\nAn even more granular update came from West\u2019s longtime collaborator Consequence, who tweeted Friday morning that the album \u201cwas turned in at 4AM\u201d and would take eight hours to make its way to digital streaming platforms. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat dinner so you guys could have this by Lunch time 12/1pm EST,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s on the album\n\nWest certainly isn\u2019t the first rapper to go the Gospel route. (Heck, even Snoop Dogg released \u201cBible of Love\u201d in 2018.)\n\nAD\n\nBut West\u2019s album may be the most high-profile among them, and on \u201cJesus Is King,\u201d West addresses his turn to God and the response his public devotion has been receiving. He also alludes to some of his controversial political statements, including his garbled take on the 13th Amendment and his widely criticized assertion that 400 years of slavery \u201csounds like a choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaid I\u2019m finna do a gospel album,\u201d he raps on \u201cHands On,\u201d the ninth track. \u201cWhat have you been hearing from the Christians? They\u2019ll be the first ones to judge me, make it feel like nobody love me.\u201d\n\nAnd while \u201cJesus Is King\u201d incorporates many sonic and thematic facets of West\u2019s previous work, one thing you won\u2019t hear is cursing. (The album is notably devoid of a parental advisory sticker.) The project opens with \u201cEvery Hour,\u201d a track featuring what West has dubbed the \u201cSunday Service Choir,\u201d and a sped-up intro that evokes the chipmunk-soul production style of his early work. The song incorporates the gospel hymn \u201cNow Let Us Sing\u201d as the choir beckons: \u201cSing til\u2019 the power of the Lord comes down.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn \u201cSelah,\u201d a track punctuated by a stomp-like rhythm, West invokes Noah (\u201cBefore the flood, people judge/ They did the same thing to Noah\u201d) and delivers a line that circulated following listening parties he hosted in the lead-up to the album\u2019s release: \u201cEverybody wanted Yandhi,\u201d he raps, alluding to his abandoned 2018 project. \u201cThen Jesus Christ did the laundry.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod Is\u201d is a reimagining of the gospel standard of the same name, with West singing in a raw voice, \u201cI know God is the force that picked me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollow God\u201d is a frenetic rap with a sample (of the gospel outfit Whole Truth\u2019s \u201cCan You Lose By Following God\u201d) that calls to mind \u201cFather Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1,\u201d a decidedly raunchier track that appeared on West\u2019s 2016 album \u201cThe Life of Pablo.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cClosed on Sunday\u201d has already raised eyebrows as the rapper trills: \u201cClosed on Sunday/ You my Chick-fil-A/ You\u2019re my number one/ With the lemonade.\u201d Beyond the cheesy line (and the prickly politics of alluding to a fast-food chain with a history of anti-LGBTQ controversies), the song notably rejects the social media fame embraced by his wife and in-laws.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHold the selfies, put the \u2018Gram away,\u201d he instructs. He also issues parental advice: \u201cWhen you got daughters, always keep them safe.\u201d As for sons, West says, \u201cTrain them in the faith.\u201d\n\nThe song ends with West proclaiming \u201cJezebel don\u2019t even stand a chance,\u201d which invokes the biblical figure associated with false prophets and sexual promiscuity.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUse This Gospel\u201d brings to mind the rapper\u2019s 2010 album \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u201d \u2014 and the incessant dinging a car makes when you leave the door ajar. It also features two collaborators from very different genres, which brings us to ...\n\nWho is on the album\n\nWhy yes, that is a Kenny G credit on a Kanye West album. The jazz saxophonist performs a solo on the 10th track, \u201cUse This Gospel\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s a true solo! No other instrument is playing.\n\n\u201cJesus Is King\u201d has West taking center stage on most of the tracks. Clipse is on \u201cUse This Gospel.\u201d Ty Dolla $ign and Ant Clemons are featured on \u201cEverything We Need.\u201d Gospel star Fred Hammond joins West on \u201cHands On.\u201d And Timbaland has a producer credit on five tracks: \u201cClosed On Sunday,\u201d \u201cWater,\u201d \u201cHands On,\u201d \u201cUse This Gospel\u201d and \u201cJesus Is Lord.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWho is not on the album\n\nSorry, Young Thug. The rapper publicly asked West earlier this month if his guest verse would make the cut on \u201cJesus Is King,\u201d and we now know the answer is no.\n\nYo @kanyewest is my verse about the devil still on Jesus ?? \u2014 Young Thug \u3072 (@youngthug) October 2, 2019\n\nThere had also been speculation about a Nicki Minaj collaboration. But earlier this week, Minaj told the Shade Room that she did a song with West \u201cthat he now wants to transform into a gospel song.\u201d\n\nMinaj wrote three different verses, she said, adding, \u201cWe ain\u2019t seeing eye to eye on it. I don\u2019t know, but, of course, I love and respect Kanye, and Kim, we\u2019ll see what happens with that.\"\n\nWhatever happened with \u201cthat\u201d is not happening on \u201cJesus Is King.\u201d\n\nWhat we know about how this was made\n\nWe\u2019ve learned more in recent days about what went into making \u201cJesus Is King.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring an interview with Beats 1\u2019s Zane Lowe on Thursday, West said that \u201cthere were times where I was asking people not to have premarital sex while they were working on the album.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe also suggested that praying and fasting could be beneficial to the process of making the album: \u201cWhen people pray together, and fast together, the power is increased.\"\n\nHe also wanted this project to be his collaborators\u2019 top \u2014 and only \u2014 priority. \u201cThere were times where I went to people that were working on other projects and said, can you just work and focus on this?\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s also a film\n\nWest didn\u2019t just release an album; he\u2019s also putting out a short Imax film of the same name.\n\nIn an early screening of the \u201cJesus Is King\u201d film on Oct. 12 in Washington, West took a front-row seat at George Washington University\u2019s Lisner Auditorium to play what he said was a finished cut of the movie (outside of a few technical glitches).\n\nStructured as vignettes, the film orbits around the Roden Crater in the Arizona desert, where American artist James Turrell has been working on a visual project since 1977. Turrell\u2019s monument in the desert is intended to be an observatory, and West was so enamored of the work that he donated $10 million in January toward its completion.\n\nAD\n\nIn the film, a choir, accompanied by a piano, performs inside the dome-like structure, singing a variety of existing gospel hymns, new tracks from the accompanying album and interpretations of the 42-year-old rapper\u2019s existing songs (such as \u201cLost in the World\u201d) reimagined with wholesome religious lyrics.\n\nThe billed 35-minute run time is largely a choral performance punctuated by text slides of choice biblical passages that echo West\u2019s professed spiritual awakening. There are still idiosyncratic visual flourishes that fans have come to expect from West, including a scene of the rapper sweeping the floor in the dead of night for nearly a minute.\n\nRead more:", "description": "The rapper takes a gospel turn on \"Jesus Is King,\" which dropped 12 hours after a self-imposed deadline.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer", "Hau Chu", "Editorial Aide Focused On Pop Culture."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hViKX_3ans6YIi8q6vJeRDWn1DI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UXGA6DHWUQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
