Returns of the product will be accepted until December 31st, and customers are being promised a full refund.\n\nBose has posted a notice about the Sleepbuds on its website, where the company recounts their development, Indiegogo campaign, and commercial release. \u201cWe knew we were attempting to do something that had never been done before. But there was no doubt in our minds \u2014 it would be worth it. Because we wanted to help you,\u201d wrote Bose general manager John Roselli. \u201cAnd for many of you, we have. You\u2019ve told us that Sleepbuds have allowed you to get your first good night\u2019s rest in years, and that you can\u2019t imagine ending the day without them.\u201d\n\nBut then Roselli goes on to acknowledge that some buyers \u201chave had a far different experience,\u201d with inconsistent battery life, the Sleepbuds failing to fully charge, and even random shutdowns.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard you. We\u2019ve read your posts. We\u2019ve documented your calls. We\u2019ve torn down returned products you\u2019ve sent us, and replaced them with new ones, sometimes more than once. We\u2019ve also relentlessly researched the root cause with a team dedicated to nothing else.\n\nAfter that research, Bose was initially hopeful it could make everything right through software and firmware updates. But it didn\u2019t work, the problems continued on, and Bose says reports of failures have spiked even higher lately. So the company took yet another look, and now it\u2019s blaming these Sleepbuds woes on the battery that powers them. \u201cWe learned that while the battery we chose functions safely, it doesn\u2019t work as consistently or predictably as it should to meet our standards,\u201d wrote Roselli.\n\nAnd as a result, Bose is discontinuing one of the more unique products it has ever released \u2014 and one that will now be remembered as a failure. The company is also issuing a strong apology to people who took a gamble on something entirely new from a business known for its noise-canceling headphones:\n\nFinally, for more than 50 years, we\u2019ve conducted extensive research to do things that no one ever thought possible. Each time, we did it to make your life better. When we\u2019ve challenged convention, we haven\u2019t always succeeded. Sometimes we\u2019ve stumbled. Sometimes, despite our diligence, things have gone wrong. And by far, our worst days are when that\u2019s impacted you. Nothing else comes close. We\u2019re sorry for disappointing you, and we\u2019re sorry for not communicating more clearly along the way. We had good intentions, but unless that makes a difference to you, it\u2019s not enough.\n\nAnd those customers have reason to be frustrated, as it took Bose a long time to reach this point amid a steady flow of complaints on the company\u2019s Sleepbuds forums.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a recall. There is no danger in using the Sleepbuds, and people are free to hold onto theirs if they so choose. Bose is also still willing to swap defective pairs for a newer hardware revision that\u2019s less susceptible (but not immune) to the erratic battery behavior. Bose says it has enough replacement sets on hand for them to last into early 2020. But if you want a refund, the company will accommodate.

Unlike wireless earbuds, they did not stream music or other user-provided audio, but instead offered a batch of preloaded, soothing sounds to help wearers fall asleep. These sounds were played \u201cat frequencies that neutralize common distracting noises.\u201d Reading around, it seems like the Sleepbuds did genuinely help some people when they worked as intended. So hopefully Bose is serious about not abandoning the opportunity altogether.", "description": "Bose is fully discontinuing its Sleepbuds, the $250 earbuds that were designed to be worn during sleep to help drown out disturbances and other unwanted noise.
