Which of the 20 classics should you play first? We had Kotaku\u2019s resident old men, Chris Kohler and Mike Fahey, Statler and Waldorf together a ranked list.\n\n20. Super Soccer\n\nChris Kohler: I played this for a minute.\n\nMike Fahey: Same. I played for a minute, got two fouls, felt very American.\n\nChris: The opposing team got the ball, started running it toward my goal, and I realised all too late that I had no idea what buttons did what.\n\nFahey: Which is exactly how real soccer works.\n\n19. Super Tennis\n\nFahey: I do understand tennis. This is definitely tennis.\n\nChris: Yes. This one I got the ball over the net a couple times.\n\nFahey: I appreciate the use of Super Nintendo\u2019s Mode 7 graphics to turn the court around once per match.\n\nChris: That\u2019s a model of restraint.\n\n18. Brawl Brothers\n\nChris: There are a lot of great side-scrolling beat-em-ups on the SNES. This is not one of them.\n\nFahey: It reminded me of several good ones, so much so that I had it higher in my list. Then I played it again.\n\nChris: It\u2019s not much to look at, the controls are stiff ... it doesn\u2019t have the personality of a Final Fight. Where\u2019s Final Fight? Oh, it\u2019s on the Capcom Beat-Em-Up Bundle. Where\u2019s Final Fight 2, then?\n\nFahey: In the hearts of little children everywhere.\n\n17. Super E.D.F. Earth Defence Force\n\nFahey: Talk about a misleading title.\n\nChris: Yeah, if you were thinking this was going to be about killing giant ants, I have bad news.\n\nFahey: That a game could make me feel bad about a lack of spiders is an amazing feat.\n\nChris: It is a competent side-scrolling shooter. Again, though, not much personality.\n\nFahey: We\u2019ll get to good games soon, I swear.\n\n16. F-Zero\n\nChris: We\u2019re there now!\n\nFahey: This is certainly a game that people love a great deal. I still love its look, if not its feel.\n\nChris: Yeah, F-Zero never really grabbed me. Not sure why.\n\nFahey: I liked the Gamecube version much better. Until the virtual console gets Gamecube games, we have this.\n\n15. Joe & Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics\n\nFahey: Here is a game I did not remember enjoying, but I\u2019m having fun with it now. Maybe I\u2019m growing up?\n\nChris: Maybe you appreciate the slow-paced leisurely island lifestyle more now that you\u2019re a parent.\n\nWhile the original was a straightforward port of the arcade game, this is a console exclusive with more adventurey elements. It\u2019s fun although it\u2019s not quite as exciting as the first one.\n\nFahey: Or dinosaurs. My kids love those dinosaurs. Either I am older and more mature or I am projecting. Either way, mildly better than those other four.\n\n14. Stunt Race FX\n\nChris: I had never played this back in the day but I\u2019m fascinated with how they pulled off a polygonal racer on the SNES.\n\nFahey: It was too slow for me back when it came out, and I was too shallow to appreciate the technical achievement. Now I gawk at it in wonder.\n\nChris: It has charm. The cars have eyes.\n\nFahey: Proper headlight eyes, none of this Pixar windshield eyes BS.\n\nChris: 10 FPS means you have time to appreciate each frame as it goes by.\n\n13. Star Fox\n\nFahey: Is this the one with the furries?\n\nChris: \u2018Tis. And I think again the personality of the characters and the design helps smooth over the fact that as an early polygonal game, it\u2019s pretty choppy.\n\nFahey: I do love the characters. And I remember being blown away by what the Super FX chip could do. They basically installed an extra GPU inside the game cartridge. That\u2019s amazing.\n\n12. Super Ghouls \u2018N Ghosts\n\nChris: They keep re-releasing this and I keep playing the first minute of it only to realise the only way I\u2019m going to get past the first minute is to make mastering this game a second career.\n\nFahey: I just choked on a delicious beverage. This is another game that was much higher on my list until I played it. Still love the look and the terrain morphing.\n\nChris: Yeah, the music, the graphics, the tech is all so beautiful! It is an appealing game. And then everything about it is designed to murder you relentlessly. I\u2019m too old for this.\n\nFahey: It will always be the fastest I\u2019ve ever gotten naked. Can\u2019t take that away.\n\n11. Pilotwings\n\nFahey: You\u2019d think there\u2019d be more non-sim games about casually flying. Aren\u2019t we humans always dreaming about this stuff?\n\nChris: It\u2019s just this side of being a glorified $US60 tech demo for the SNES\u2019 sprite rotating and scaling ability, and yet it\u2019s still super fun. You\u2019re right, the \u201ccasual flight\u201d genre is not particularly robust.\n\nFahey: I am surprised we aren\u2019t playing the latest Pilotwings game on our Switches right now. This will have to do.\n\n10. Kirby\u2019s Dream Land 3\n\nChris: I forgot to play this. This is good, right?\n\nFahey: As a fan of everything Kirby, it is indeed good. It\u2019s still too early a game for Kirby to transform into different forms based on which powers he\u2019s using, but the mechanics are all present and accounted for.\n\nChris: OK. I assumed.\n\nFahey: KIRBY FOR LIFE!\n\n9. Demon\u2019s Crest\n\nFahey: Look at us in the single digits, and with a Ghouls \u2018n Ghosts spin-off no less.\n\nChris: It\u2019s all the beautiful animation, art design, music, etc. from Ghouls \u2018n Ghosts except you actually have a life bar and mobility and half a chance of winning. This is a very good action game with RPG elements.\n\nFahey: I remember peeing a little when the dragon peeked through the bars during the game\u2019s opening sequence. In my defence, I was just a young boy of *checks release date* err, 21. Maybe I was drunk.\n\n8. Super Puyo Puyo 2\n\nChris: It\u2019s Puyo Puyo, which is a good thing.\n\nFahey: What I love most about Super Puyo Puyo, aside from its Puyo Puyo-ness, is it opens with an anti-AIDS message.\n\nChris: I saw that! That\u2019s awesome. This particular edition is well-liked for having four-player support. At this point I\u2019m sure you have four Switch controllers.\n\nFahey: And some of them work!\n\n7. Breath of Fire\n\nFahey: It\u2019s no Chrono Trigger. It\u2019s none of the Final Fantasies. If I had to pick a turn-based Super Nintendo role-playing game that was not either of those, this would easily be fourth or fifth on my list.\n\nChris: And yet, where are the Chrono Triggers and Final Fantasies? Certainly not here. So it falls to plucky Breath of Fire to fill the void. I mean, it\u2019s pretty good though.\n\nFahey: Oh yes, I will happily take Breath of Fire any day. Hell, it\u2019s time for a new, non-free-to-play mobile sequel. I\u2019m sure Capcom is totally on top of that.\n\n6. Super Mario Kart\n\nChris: When I read the words \u201cSuper Mario Kart,\u201d the soundtrack just starts playing in my head immediately.\n\nFahey: My trigger fingers starts me a-hopping. It\u2019s like F-Zero for people with taste.\n\nChris: I wish it had four-player balloon battle mode, but I\u2019ll just have to live without it.\n\nFahey: One day there will be a Mario Kart game with that mode, Chris. One day.\n\n5. Kirby\u2019s Dream Course\n\nFahey: Now we are talking. For all of the excellent platformers and free-to-play four-player Switch battle games out there, Kirby as a golf ball is the most charming Kirby of them all.\n\nChris: Oh man, this is still the best golf game ever. So clever. You know, a prototype of the unreleased pre-Kirby version of this, called Special Tee Shot, was just dumped. Would be cool if Nintendo put the final version of it on this service.\n\nFahey: Maybe they will include it in the modern version of Kirby\u2019s Dream Course secretly being developed inside my head.\n\n4. Super Mario World\n\nChris: I remember when this came out on the Wii U and it was like, ah, finally, a game to play on my Wii U.\n\nSwitch has a few more games though.\n\nFahey: A couple, yes.\n\nThis one was tough for me. I feel like Yoshi\u2019s Island and Super Mario Land are constantly duking it out inside my head.\n\nChris: Yeah, this one is still a fantastic Mario game, but in the fullness of time you can see that it\u2019s not quite as ambitious as Yoshi\u2019s Island.\n\nWe\u2019re splitting hairs at this point though.\n\nFahey: And spitting eggs.\n\n3. Super Mario World 2: Yoshi\u2019s Island\n\nFahey: In the battle between more Mario and something cool and new, cool and new won.\n\nChris: We\u2019re deep into \u201cmasterpiece\u201d territory now. Playing it again, you can see that the art design still looks fantastic. And that music!\n\nFahey: It\u2019s ageless, like you.\n\nChris: Yoshi\u2019s Island will be here after we are all gone.\n\n2. The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past\n\nChris: I think this is still the best old-school formula Zelda. Prove me wrong.\n\nFahey: Do I have to?\n\nChris: No.\n\nFahey: I would go as far as saying that A Link to the Past is my favourite Legend of Zelda game. The modern 3D stuff has its own flavour. I like 2D better.\n\nChris: You don\u2019t need to qualify this with \u201cWell, you see, at the time this was released...\u201d \u2014 it just holds up. You could put this on a cartridge and sell it (although I\u2019ll glady take it as part of a super cheap yearly subscription instead)!\n\n1. Super Metroid\n\nFahey: The closest thing we had to a huge disagreement on placement in the rankings, solved by ten minutes of playing this legendary game.\n\nChris: It is the best Metroid. If you\u2019ve played any other Metroid game and thought, oh, this is cool, but you haven\u2019t played this \u2014 this is better.\n\nFahey: I\u2019d rather be playing it right now.\n\nChris: Harsh.", "description": "After years of wishing and hoping, Nintendo finally added a selection of Super Nintendo games to its Switch online service.
