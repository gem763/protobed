Who are these recently exposed Kremlin agents?\n\nREAD MORE: Russian assets in America. A field guide\n\nEver since the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016, the US media has been ferreting out the Russian meddlers within the country, as it\u2019s their patriotic duty to do. Not even the disappointment of the Mueller report finding no Russian collusion could stop them \u2013 they know that Putin must have gotten to Mueller somehow, and Trump will always be a Kremlin puppet in their hearts. Meanwhile, any politician who flinches from the idea that endless war is good and noble is tagged and bagged as a Russian agent.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, aka: Assad apologist\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard has served in the US Army National Guard since 2003, but her deployment to Iraq was obviously merely a stunt to provide cover for her real goal of cuddling with baby-eating evil Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and trying to lure the US into abandoning its sacred duty to wage war in the Middle East for as long as possible. The election security bill she introduced in the House last year, which would have forced districts to use paper ballots, was a transparent effort to pry American elections out of the trustworthy hands of the Pentagon. And the 'Stop Arming Terrorists Act'? That\u2019s just discrimination!\n\nSo when Kerry, Pelosi and the Queen met with him to speak, are they \u201cAssad apologists\u201d too?\n\n\n\nNobody likes Assad, he shouldn\u2019t be trusted. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have talks of diplomacy and trying to end the forever wars. pic.twitter.com/yIXucPOBB6 \u2014 Lady Likezz (@LadyLikezz) August 23, 2019\n\nCNN witchfinder-general Bakari Sellers sniffed Gabbard out earlier this week, just as she was poised to return to the debate stage and probably fill the audience\u2019s ears with insidious Russian lies, telling a table of surprised panelists there is \u201cno question that Tulsi Gabbard, of all the 12 [candidates], is a puppet for the Russian government.\u201d They weren't ready for that truth bomb!\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Russians\u2019 are grooming Tulsi Gabbard, hints Hillary Clinton (& by the way, Jill Stein\u2019s \u2018totally\u2019 a Russian asset too)\n\nNBC has also exposed the Kremlin\u2019s siren, calling upon disinformation aficionados New Knowledge\u2019s report to show that the \u201cRussia's propaganda machine\u201d was fueling Gabbard's popularity on social media. New Knowledge fabricated just such a \"propaganda machine\" to tank Republican senate candidate Roy Moore's campaign in 2017, so you know they're experts.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, aka: Russian bot handler & troll farmer\n\nZuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, was the one who allowed \u2018Russian trolls\u2019 to buy $100,000 worth of random ads on his platform in 2016, insisting that .01 percent of the $1 billion spent on advertising during the election period wasn\u2019t a big deal until long after everyone else had fallen in line with the \u201cRussians hacked our democracy\u201d narrative. And with 2020 looming, he\u2019s at it again, selling out our democracy to Putin by way of Trump! Liberals were shocked to learn earlier this week that Zuckerberg had been meeting with conservatives in private, off-the-record dinners, and declared the billionaire must be plotting to throw another election to the Russians.\n\nAlso on rt.com Forget privacy abuses, liberals call to DeleteFacebook after learning Zuckerberg met with conservatives\n\nNoted Russia experts like Molly McKew and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) exposed Zuckerberg even before #DeleteFacebook started trending among the #Resistance, leaving liberals scurrying to come up with arguments why they should be allowed to keep Instagram and WhatsApp. Quick, Putin, now's your chance to buy hundreds of dollars' worth of ads on Instagram featuring awkward memes and steal the 2020 election!\n\nThe NRA, aka: the Russia-backed domestic terrorist group\n\nThe National Rifle Association may seem as American as apple pie, but that's exactly what made it so delicious to the Russians. The Senate Finance Committee spent a full 18 months digging up the dirt on the Second Amendment-protecting organization, and it didn't disappoint with its report published last month. The NRA, it claims, actively cooperated with Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\nAlso on rt.com NRA was a \u2018foreign asset\u2019 of Russia in 2016 election, claims report by Senate Democrats\n\nBy allowing the dreaded Russian gun enthusiast Maria Butina to mingle with NRA members, the organization irreversibly infected itself with Putin cooties, and the only solution is to strip it of its tax-exempt status, and maybe tar and feather it, to set an example for any other group that thinks it can stick up for Americans' constitutional rights.\n\nThe Republican staff of the committee disagreed, but we all \"know\" the Republican Party has been heavily infiltrated by Russians ever since the election of Donald Trump. After all, the leader of the Senate Republicans is 'Moscow Mitch' McConnell, and he's clearly a Russian operative, or else how would he end up with that nickname?\n\nRand Paul, aka: Red Paul\n\nThe Republican congressman from Kentucky is a staunch anti-interventionist, and therefore already deeply suspect. But he made it onto the list for demanding \u2013 on MSNBC, no less \u2013 that Congress should investigate Hunter Biden earlier this week.\n\nThe former vice president's son may have received $50,000 a month for a position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company despite having no experience in the energy sector, but that doesn't mean there was any corruption involved \u2013 after all, Anderson Cooper said the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d involving the withholding of $1 billion in IMF loans unless Ukraine fired a prosecutor investigating that company was completely baseless in front of all the Democratic presidential candidates.\n\n.@RandPaul\n\n\u20141 of 2 to vote NO to support NATO before #HelsinkiTreasonSummit\n\n\n\n\u2014On Russian interference: \u201cWe all do it\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014Visited Russia July 4 & before 2018 midterms\n\n\n\nSenator McCain was correct: \"The Senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin\u201dpic.twitter.com/bJuGtomauU \u2014 Trinity Resists (@TrinityResists) October 15, 2019\n\n\u200bCase closed! Paul's Russian talking points aren\u2019t fooling anyone. Also, John McCain said Paul was \u201cworking for Vladimir Putin,\u201d so it must be true.\n\nDonald Trump, aka: Putin\u2019s puppet-in-chief\n\nIn case anyone forgot, the White House is Kremlin-controlled territory right now, and the Orange One himself has been rubbing it in our faces by colluding with Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden\u2019s son. How better to throw everyone off the trail than to cuddle up to Russia\u2019s rival? You\u2019re not fooling anyone, Mr. President \u2013 if that\u2019s your real name.\n\nComing to Broadway in 2021: no longer in office, Nancy Pelosi & Adam Schiff headline this cast of ex-Democratic politicians in a gripping musical saga of how, from elections to Black Lives Matter protests, from troop withdrawals to the common cold, \"All Roads Lead to Putin.\" https://t.co/D3BkfPEPMV \u2014 Aaron Mat\u00e9 (@aaronjmate) October 17, 2019\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called out his true loyalties earlier this week, pointing out that everything he\u2019s done in office has been for Russia in a dramatic moment captured on camera and mischaracterized as an \u201cunhinged meltdown\u201d by Putin\u2019s puppet in the White House. \u201cAll roads lead to Putin,\u201d Pelosi crowed victoriously when reporters asked her what had really gone on in that room before she stormed out. She knows better than to be discouraged by the Mueller report\u2019s findings of \u201cno collusion.\u201d After all, what is \u201cno collusion\u201d but collusion that hasn\u2019t been found yet?\n\nBy Helen Buyniski, RT\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
