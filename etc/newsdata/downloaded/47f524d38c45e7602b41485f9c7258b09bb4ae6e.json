I must be in a good physical and mental condition to face this challenge.\n\nGianluca Vialli (left) is continuing to live his normal life as he battles against pancreatic cancer\n\nFans from his former clubs, including Sampdoria (pictured), have rallied to show their support\n\n'I'm fine now, I'm continuing the treatment. We must have patience, it is harder than one could hope for.\n\n'But the results are positive and it makes no sense for me not to continue living a normal life.'\n\nNormality for Vialli includes an increasingly important role alongside Roberto Mancini as the Italy national team prepares for next year's European Championship.\n\nHis assistance had looked set to be made into a formal role within the Italy camp next month but his ongoing cancer treatment could delay this.\n\nIt was 12 months ago that Vialli, the former Sampdoria and Juventus striker, first revealed his battle with the disease.\n\nAs a player, he dealt with heartache and the death of loved ones in the 1990s.\n\nHe was left in tears at the passing of close friend and Juventus team-mate Andrea Fortunato in 1995.\n\nHe is recognisable as bald by many but he used to have a full head of hair while at Juventus\n\nFortunato was one of Italy's most exciting young players in the 1980s and 1990s as he excelled at full-back for Juventus.\n\nBut tragedy struck late in 1994 when Vialli's friend fell ill after complaining of lacking energy in games, often failing to complete 90 minutes.\n\nDoctors diagnosed him with a rare form of leukaemia; he died on April 25, 1995 following a short fight with a tumour.\n\nThe death of close friend and team-mate Andrea Fortunato (pictured) in 1995 left Vialli in tears. While Fortunato battled through chemotherapy, Vialli shaved his head to show he was fighting all the way his friend\n\nVialli had cut his hair to show his friend he was in it together, the illness and the months of chemotherapy he was subjected to.\n\nIt was designed to remind Fortunato that he was not alone in his fight. It was yet another beautiful story of friendship that best describes Vialli as a person.\n\nVialli is also fighting for him now. He plans to defeat what Andrea could not and he knows he has the support of his friend and his family.\n\nFor a life that is punching him to new depths, Vialli has responded by kicking back, determined to show the warrior spirit he displayed as a player.\n\nLife is a maze of emotions and fears, of suffering and joy; Vialli would never have thought of getting lost in this maze at the age of 55.\n\n'I thought I had beaten the evil but the battle started again,' Vialli wrote in his autobiography, 'Goals', in which the desire to live, to travel and to smile shines through.\n\nHis smile is unchanged, the colour of his skin now has a more opaque grain, but his funny expressions from his smile are always tender.\n\nHe never let the hair return as an homage to Fortunato as his career flourished with trophies\n\nA move to Chelsea followed in 1996 and he was seen as a 'lion' who fought hard on the pitch\n\nGIANLUCA VIALLI CAREER HONOURS SAMPDORIA Serie A: 1990\u201391 Coppa Italia: 1984\u201385, 1987\u201388, 1988\u201389 Italian Super Cup: 1991 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: 1989\u201390 JUVENTUS Serie A: 1994\u201395 Coppa Italia: 1994\u201395 Italian Super Cup: 1995 UEFA Champions League: 1995\u201396 UEFA Cup: 1992\u201393 CHELSEA FA Cup: 1996\u201397 League Cup: 1997\u201398 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: 1997\u201398 Manager CHELSEA FA Cup: 1999\u20132000 League Cup: 1997\u201398 UEFA Super Cup: 1998 FA Charity Shield: 2000 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: 1997\u201398\n\nVialli invites everyone to smile and not to hide it because of his cancer. All of his closest friends are there to support him in one of the hardest battles of his life.\n\nIt is a battle he has no intention of losing.\n\n'I want to be an inspiration to others,' he adds.\n\n'I want someone to look at me and tell me: \"It's also thanks to you if I never gave up.\"'\n\nHis book helped channel his feelings towards fighting the illness and has become a motivational tool to tell the many stories he has gathered from his life.\n\nFor Vialli, every story is a teaching. It was more than just an autobiography, a book detailing other people's sporting events.\n\nIt is the story of a struggling man taking on a serious illness and it is brimming with inspiring anecdotes.\n\nVialli was a lion on the field, at Sampdoria and Juventus as well as at Chelsea. He helped pave the way for Italians coming over to England.\n\nHe fought hard and raced, sweated and scored to defend the Chelsea shirt.\n\nToday he is a lion wounded by the disease that continues to fight against him.\n\nHe has not been afraid to show the world his weary face as he stands tall in the face of adversity.\n\nVialli chose to resume a normal life despite the doctors' fears. He has vowed to die only once and not every day, he wants to carry out his life without any limitations.\n\nHis dream is to continue to travel between London, Cremona and Milan - the three places he calls home. And on his travels he wants to teach everyone how to live.", "description": "ALVISE CAGNAZZO IN ITALY: Chelsea legend Gianluca Vialli is continuing to receive treatment in his fight to beat cancer.
