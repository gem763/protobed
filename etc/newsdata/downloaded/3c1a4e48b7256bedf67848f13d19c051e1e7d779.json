Never again does Trump need to repeat that request behind closed doors or send an emissary like Rudy Giuliani on his behalf. If you\u2019re Beijing and you\u2019re looking to soften up Trump\u2019s position on the trade war or other global matters, you know what to do.\n\nIn fact, after reading this Financial Times story, I thought back to how quiet Trump has been about the NBA kerfuffle this week and about Hong Kong generally. A reporter specifically asked him last night if he was okay with the Chinese government pressuring the NBA over Hong Kong. That\u2019s between them, said the president of the United States. Did he pass on criticizing China because, let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s an authoritarian by instinct himself and would love to have the power to silence corporate critics through economic pressure? Or did he pass on criticizing China because they\u2019ve been cooperative lately in investigating corruption by family members of certain former U.S. officials?\n\nMichael Pillsbury is an \u201cinformal\u201d advisor to Trump on China, a trade hawk in the mold of Peter Navarro. He was in Beijing last week. Guess what subject came up.\n\n\u201cI got a quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese,\u201d [Michael] Pillsbury told the Financial Times\u2026 \u201cI tried to bring up the topic in Beijing,\u201d Mr Pillsbury told the [Fox Business channel]. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen them get so secretive in my entire life. They would discuss ICBM warheads sooner than talk about what Hunter Biden was doing in China with [former] vice-president Biden.\u201d\u2026 Mr Pillsbury declined to say whether he was asked to raise the issue by the president. The White House did not respond to a request for comment\u2026 Asked to provide details about the information he received from his Chinese contacts, Mr Pillsbury would only say that it related to a $1.5bn payment from the Bank of China. That figure matches the amount that Mr Trump last week claimed Hunter Biden received from China \u2014 a statement that has not been backed up with any evidence.\n\nTrump mentioned the sum of $1.5 billion last week in connection with Hunter Biden and China but it\u2019s unclear where he got that number. The NYT notes that $1.5 billion happens to be the amount that a Chinese private equity firm was trying to raise in 2014; Hunter Biden sits on the board of that firm and owns 10 percent of it. The Bank of China is its biggest shareholder. The theory, I guess, is that the Chinese government is or was laundering bribes to Hunter Biden disguised as returns on investment in the firm, presumably to buy influence with his dad. But there\u2019s no evidence of that. Did Pillsbury get some or is he just trying to mess with Joe Biden\u2019s head in chattering about information on Hunter?\n\nEither way, it\u2019s an \u2026 interesting strategy to tell the media that a foreign state is giving you \u201cbackground\u201d on Biden\u2019s son after the president encouraged that state to investigate him when Democrats are on the verge of impeaching Trump for exactly that offense in another context. Marco Rubio has taken to saying lately that Trump calling on China to investigate the Bidens was \u201cinappropriate\u201d but that ultimately it\u2019s no big deal because it wasn\u2019t a \u201creal proposal,\u201d just a bit of presidential trolling to bait the media. Now that he knows that Pillsbury has actually received information about Hunter Biden from China \u2014 and is being coy about whether the president himself asked him to raise the issue \u2014 does Marco want to revisit his opinion?\n\nHere\u2019s something else on the wires today. It\u2019s not directly related to Ukraine but consider the substance of what Trump\u2019s being accused of here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pressed then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to help persuade the Justice Department to drop a criminal case against an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who was a client of Rudy Giuliani, according to three people familiar with the 2017 meeting in the Oval Office. Tillerson refused, arguing it would constitute interference in an ongoing investigation of the trader, Reza Zarrab, according to the people. They said other participants in the Oval Office were shocked by the request. Tillerson immediately repeated his objections to then-chief of staff John Kelly in a hallway conversation just outside the Oval Office, emphasizing that the request would be illegal.\n\nA high government official attempts to use the power of his office to disrupt a criminal investigation as a personal favor to the target of that investigation. That\u2019s what Joe Biden is accused of in Ukraine \u2014 in Trump\u2019s telling, he pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor probing corruption at Burisma because he was afraid the probe might eventually reach Hunter Biden. Meanwhile, according to this Bloomberg story, Trump asked his chief diplomat to pressure prosecutors at the Justice Department into dropping a probe into Rudy Giuliani\u2019s friend. In each case the goal is to spare a crony from legal consequences simply because he has a connection to the White House.\n\nIs that going to end up tacked onto the Democrats\u2019 articles of impeachment? If nothing else, \u201cTrump did exactly what he accused Biden of doing\u201d is a good talking point for them.\n\nExit question: Does China want Trump reelected next year? The easiest counterargument to the Pillsbury story is that it makes no sense that they would be trying to help Trump defeat Biden. Of the two, Trump is by far the bigger China hawk. Trump\u2019s the one who\u2019s damaged their economy with a protracted trade war. If anything, China might be inclined to offer Biden dirt on Trump, right?\n\nI don\u2019t know. Trump is certainly more of a threat economically than a Democrat would be, but arguably he\u2019s less of a threat militarily than Democrats are. He\u2019s telegraphed repeatedly via his outreach to North Korea and Iran how reluctant he is to go to war, preferring diplomacy even with the world\u2019s worst rogue regimes. And he\u2019s waaaaaaaay less of a believer in international alliances than virtually every prominent Democrat is. One of the reasons Obama pursued TPP at the end of his presidency was because he thought a trade alliance between the U.S. and China\u2019s neighbords in the Far East would work to contain China\u2019s regional influence. Trump left TPP. And he\u2019s talked before about withdrawing U.S. troops from Japan and the Korean peninsula. And he\u2019s made his disdain for NATO, America\u2019s most significant military alliance, repeatedly clear. A second term for Trump might mean a protracted trade war with the U.S. but it might also see American withdrawal from various theaters \u2014 including the Far East \u2014 which would give China a freer hand to operate militarily in Hong Kong and Taiwan, among other places.\n\nAnd maybe the trade war won\u2019t be protracted. China understands that Trump is under pressure to end it sooner rather than later to spare American manufacturing and agriculture any more grief. Odds are no worse than fair that Trump will make a bad deal sometime next year to end the standoff purely in the interest of being able to tout the end of tariffmania on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, there\u2019s no guarantee that a Democratic president wouldn\u2019t continue the trade war if elected. Elizabeth Warren is a populist too and a skeptic of free trade, remember. And often policies passed by one administration have a certain inertia in persisting in succeeding administrations, even when they\u2019re managed by the other party. (The words \u201cAfghanistan\u201d and \u201cObamaCare\u201d come to mind.) China may believe that it\u2019ll meet more hostility on balance from a Democratic president than it will from Trump, particularly if it earns his good favor by lending him a hand quietly in his reelection effort.", "description": "Dirt.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/c-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
