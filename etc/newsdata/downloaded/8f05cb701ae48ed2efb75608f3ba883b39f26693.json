Earlier this week, the IMF slashed its 2019 growth forecast for the territory to 0.3 per cent, down from a 2.7 per cent projection made in April.\n\nMs Lam said on Wednesday that Hong Kong had entered a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d, as pro-democracy protesters forced her annual policy speech to be suspended.\n\nLosing the money and confidence of some of its richest residents, as well as the upper echelons of the middle class, would exacerbate the downturn and threaten its position as Asia\u2019s premier financial centre.\n\n\u201cEuropean cities had been losing ground to Hong Kong for years, but that situation is reversing now,\u201d one bank executive told the FT. \u201cThere is now a lot of interest in shifting money out of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are just at the first stages, people are enquiring and . . . [some] are opening accounts in Singapore, but not moving their cash just yet,\u201d they added. \u201cAlso, London and Switzerland are not looking such bad places to move money, despite Brexit, considering all the Asia turmoil at the margins.\u201d\n\nThe executive at the Singaporean bank said that three months ago it was receiving about 80 applications a month to open accounts from a variety of clients, from the lower end up to private banking level. But the number of applications had skyrocketed, driven mainly by Hong Kong-based clients looking to hedge themselves against an intensification of the unrest, they said.\n\nIn August, the bank received 400 applications to open accounts, taking the total this year to about 600. So far, about 75 to 80 per cent of applications have translated into account openings, given that the bank needs to complete know-your-customer and due diligence procedures, the executive said.\n\nOnly a few Hong Kong clients \u2014 many of whom already had a relationship with the bank \u2014 have transferred money into these new Singapore accounts since protests kicked off, for a total of about $S300m-$S400m, the banker said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivate banking clients do not account for the bulk of these new openings, given that they tend to already have a network of accounts with different banking institutions, the executive said.\n\nSpokespeople for the four banks declined to comment.\n\nForeign banks, eager to make inroads to China\u2019s fast-growing economy, have had to tread carefully when dealing with its authorities. UBS was forced to suspend one of its senior economists over the summer when he made remarks relating to a bout of swine fever in China that were interpreted as insulting. He has since been reinstated and returned to work.
