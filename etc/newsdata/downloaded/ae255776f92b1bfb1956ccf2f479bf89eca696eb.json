The moment you succeed with a ban in one place, it pops up in ten other places.\"", "description": "Spanish authorities accuse the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic group of being a 'criminal organisation'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/126A2/production/_109462457_gettyimages-1176982760.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
