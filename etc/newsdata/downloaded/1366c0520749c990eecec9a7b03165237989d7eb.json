'Having Ellen [White] back will hopefully give us more firepower but we've got to get on the training pitch as a group and improve.'\n\nA strike from Vivianne Miedema was enough for Arsenal to secure a 1-0 win over Man City\n\nThe Gunners' win at Meadow Park stopped last season's champions going six points clear\n\nFACT BOX TITLE Arsenal (4-3-3): Zinsberger; Evans, Williamson, Beattie, McCabe, Walti, Little, Nobbs (Roord (90+2'); Van de Donk, Miedema, Mead (Maier (90+3') Subs not used: Peyraud-Magnin, Quinn, Mitchell, Veje Goal: Miedema Bookings: McCabe Manchester City (4-3-3): Roebuck; Fidalgo (Campbell 61'), Houghton, Bonner, Stokes, Scott, Weir, Wullaert (Bremer 61'); Hemp, Beckie (White 66'), Stanway Subs not used: Benameur, Toland, Park, Geum-min Bookings: Bonner Referee: Rebecca Welch Attendance: 2,424\n\nWith a distinct lack of goal-scoring opportunities for both sides it quickly became apparent it would be the cautious affair that had widely been anticipated, remembering these sides hold all of the domestic trophies in the women's game between them.\n\nHaving maintained a solid defensive shape for much of the first half, City's lapse of concentration saw them concede the first goal of their 2019/20 FA WSL campaign - and their unbeaten run hanging in the balance.\n\nVivianne Miedema - who passed a late fitness test after suffering a calf injury last week - scored the only goal of the game on the 43rd minute. With City's Gemma Bonner and Steph Houghton dragged apart, the lethal Dutch forward latched onto a perfectly weighted ball from Kim Little to bury her low drive into the bottom of Ellie Roebuck's net from close range.\n\n'When Kim gets the ball in that position I know that I can make a run and I know that I'm going to get it. We deserved the goal, we controlled the game and we dominated today,' said match winner Miedema, after netting her 49th goal since arriving at the club.\n\n'We wanted to bounce back after the Chelsea game and I think we've done that today. We probably should have scored two or three more goals but we're really happy and can turn our focus to [Champions League tie on] Thursday.'\n\nSunday's loss makes it back to back defeats for City, after their loss to United in midweek\n\nArsenal turned on an assured display - dominating possession and patient in their build up play, something they had lacked in their 2-1 defeat away to Chelsea a fortnight ago. The Gunners could have doubled their lead through Jordan Nobbs in stoppage time, but the popular number eight dragged her effort wide.\n\nAlthough City's summer signings have been hit by an injury curse this season - defender Aoife Mannion was spotted in the stands with her crutches after undergoing ACL surgery - there was a welcome return, albeit from the bench, for England goalscorer Ellen White. A pleasing sight for Phil Neville with another international break looming.\n\nArsenal's impressive home form continues - they've lost just one of their last 26 games in the Super League at Meadow Park. Sparta Prague are the visitors in the Champions League on Thursday. Chelsea came from behind to beat West Ham United and go top of the FA WSL table.
