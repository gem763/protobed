Abbott Laboratories, a manufacturer of health-care products, reported a 4% hit on sales from foreign exchange rates in key emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Russia and China. Johnson & Johnson, meanwhile, reported sales in markets outside the U.S. were 2.8% lower because of currency effects. Philip Morris\u2019s net revenue was reduced by $115 million because of currency effects in the third quarter, resulting in a foreign-exchange impact of $931 million since the beginning of the year. \u201cCurrency is something that is very hard to predict,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Martin King said in an interview Thursday. The company hedges against movements in some currencies, including the Japanese yen, he said. During the second quarter, North American companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq recorded currency-related losses of $21.01 billion, down from $23.39 billion in the first quarter, according to Kyriba. Exchange rate-related losses at these companies have exceeded $20 billion for three consecutive quarters. European companies listed on the FTSE 100 and Euronext reported a decline in foreign-exchange effects to $1.55 billion in the second quarter, down from $3.31 billion in the first quarter of 2019, Kyriba said.
