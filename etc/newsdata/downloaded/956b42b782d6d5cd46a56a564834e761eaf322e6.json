Did the car go forwards when it was supposed to go backwards or did the brakes fail?\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\u201cDid something or somebody force the vehicle to go over the edge? We also of have to try and establish that it was an accident and that there was not an intent to drive the car over the edge.\n\n\u201cThere are many unanswered questions and it is our job to answer them all,\u201d said the source.\n\nThe couple were popular in the village which has only 100 homes and a population of 750 people which more than quadruples when tourists travelling the Garden Route stop over in the summer.\n\nThe couple who had been married 13 years had their own company called the Garden Route Management Group and oversaw the renting out holiday homes on behalf of their owners.\n\nThey also ran the popular Herolds Bay Caf\u00e9 near the beach which was popular with the many surfers and swimmers and fisherman who flock to the village for the waves and peace and quiet.\n\nIt is believed that one of their two children had special needs and may have had Down Syndrome but friends of the family refused to say if that put extra pressure on businesswoman Heidi.\n\nHusband Ettienne said the family had left their detached home and driven to a nearby car park above Voelklip beach and walked down a path to the sand below at 5pm on Tuesday evening.\n\nHe was due to fly to Mozambique on Wednesday to see other members of his family while his wife and children stayed behind so had taken them down as a treat before leaving the next morning.\n\nThe father-of-two told local media before news broke that the family car had been found at the bottom of a cliff that after playing on the beach he had to go and check on a nearby property.\n\nHe said: \u201dIt was a property we manage for clients so I went to check it was safe and secure and my wife and children were going straight home from there and then I went back to our caf\u00e9.\n\n\u201cI got my car and drove home for about 7pm but they were not home. We live so close to the beach that it takes only minutes for them to get home in the car and I got worried immediately.\n\n\u201cI started phoning all her friends and family but nobody had seen her and I went driving round the streets looking for her car but when it got to 9pm I found no sign and went to the police.\"\n\nHe told local media that he was even more worried as one of his children had special needs.\n\nPolice spokesperson Captain Malcolm Pojie confirmed the body of Mr Scheepers' son had been found and said: \u201cThe tragic news was broken to the dad when the boy was found.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"We have a full team of rescue personnel here including police divers, the lifeboat, men who have abseiled to the foot of the cliff and a helicopter and I am grateful to them all.\n\n\"The weather conditions are not helping us at all and we hope to get inside the vehicle soon and recover the missing people if they are still inside or retrieve them from along the coast.\"\n\nIn 2015 three students from Nelson Mandela University in nearby George died at the same spot when their Toyota pick-up truck went over the 100m cliff in a mysterious accident.", "description": "Heidi Scheepers, 35, and daughter Cuzette, 6, and son Hugo, 2, died instantly after the horror death plunge in their VW Caravelle in South Africa", "authors": ["Jamie Pyatt", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20726132.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-JPHEIDI2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
