That lack of liquidity in the repo market resulted in short-term rates spiking by at least 10% in September, even though banks like JPMorgan were able and willing to step in to relieve the pressure in the system and lower key lending rates.\n\nJPMorgan JPM, +0.17% has $120 billion parked at the Fed now, Dimon said. The balance regularly goes down to $60 billion, but not much below that level because of regulatory rules.\n\n\u201cWe might have made the wrong interpretation [of the rules], it is possible. But I think we all were approximately at the same place on this,\u201d he said.\n\nDimon says the same issue is lurking in the broader market. He said he thinks the total liquidity in the financial system is $4 trillion, referring to assets that banks hold at the Fed, repo auctions and Treasurys, among other assets. The repo market is the market where investors, including hedge funds and other institutional investors, manage leveraged positions borrow.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve spoken to the regulators and I think they\u2019re quite bright and they\u2019ll look at this. And they should do it before the crisis happens\u2014because it will happen.\u2019 Jamie Dimon\n\nOn a conference call to discuss its third-quarter results last week, Dimon made similar comments about regulatory restraints, saying that rules in place restricted the behemoth money-center lender from providing short-term funding to the broader market.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the repo market is kind of instructive,\u201d he said at Friday\u2019s event. \u201cThe same issue will happen eventually in what I call the big liquidity thing, the $4 trillion,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re locked up on the ability [to intermediate] because of a multitude of regulations, that might cause more consternation in the market, which you don\u2019t want,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBanks hit that limit [in the repo market] and couldn\u2019t deploy liquidity. The same issue will happen eventually in the big liquidity thing - the $4 trillion,\u201d when markets become volatile, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to the regulators and I think they\u2019re quite bright and they\u2019ll look at this. And they should do it before the crisis happens\u2014because it will happen,\u201d Dimon said.\n\nIn addition to daily liquidity auctions, where the Fed purchases Treasury debt, the central bank recently said it would provide emergency liquidity by buying some $60 billion of Treasury bills a month, expanding its balance sheet.", "description": "JPMorgan Chase CEP Jamie Dimon said the money-market turmoil highlights risk of bigger crisis and the Fed should pay attention.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GQ145_dimon0_ZG_20180916205042.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
