Fuel consumption is a claimed 67.3mpg, with CO2 emissions at 110g/km.\n\nIt\u2019s a feisty performer, falling short of being a performance car but packing plenty of sporting prowess.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a stylish and flexible friend, whether you are a junior executive on the up, or a young family wanting space for small children and a decent 480-litre boot for all the kit, but aren\u2019t quite ready yet to go for the ubiquitous SUV.\n\nThe BMW 3-Series is Britain's biggest selling saloon car and still matters even in an age of SUVs\n\nI also tried out the petrol 330i sport \u2013 in a gorgeous shade of metallic blue - costing from \u00a337,660 which will account for about one in 10 of all UK sales.\n\nPowered by a 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine, developing 258 horsepower, it accelerates at a pace from rest to 62mph in a swifter 5.8 seconds and up to a top speed limited to 155mph. This means lower fuel economy at 48.7mpg and higher CO2 emissions of 132g/km, however.\n\nBut my blistering burn-up around the track was in a lightly-disguised M340i, powered by a seriously hefty 3.0-litre six-cylinder twin-turbo petrol engine developing 374 horsepower and able to accelerate from rest to 62mph in 4.4 seconds.\n\nIt performed majestically around the tightest of turns \u2013 and it really gets the adrenalin pumping.\n\nAlbeit, I did leave some of the safety and stability systems on, so I had a bit of onboard back-up to aid my own modest skills.\n\nInside the 3-Series is comfortable and has a well laid out dashboard and interior\n\nThe 480-litre boot will swallow the family's kit for long trips, or a couple of golf bags - and being German the rear seats fold down to fit your skis in\n\nIt will become the flagship top-of the range 3 Series model when it arrives in UK showrooms in July next year, priced from around \u00a350,000, that is until a full-on M3 arrives to take the crown.\n\nAn all-wheel drive xDrive version with the same 190hp diesel engine \u2013 which I didn\u2019t drive \u2013 costs from \u00a336,800 and will hit 62mph in 6.9 seconds and go up to a top speed of 145mph, with average fuel economy of 62.8mpg and CO2 emissions of 118g/km.\n\nA 330e iPerformance model with plug-in hybrid drive \u2013 with an electric only range of 37-miles, 0-62mph in six seconds and a top speed of 143mph - will also follow.\n\nClearly this an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary shift into the seventh generation of the 3-series, of which more than 15 million have been sold globally since the first generation was launched more than 40 years ago in 1975.\n\nBMW describes the 3-Series as the \u2018heartbeat\u2019 of its brand and Ray Massey was impressed\n\nBMW describes it as the \u2018heartbeat\u2019 of its brand. Other refer to it as the bread and butter Bimmer, accounting for nearly a third of total sales. Around 25,000 are sold in the UK each year alone.\n\nThe 3-Series has, of course, grown over the years. Dimensions-wise, the new 3-Series continues that, it is longer (by 85mm), wider (by 16mm) but more streamlined than the car it replaces and only 1mm taller.\n\nThe wheelbase has been extended by 41mm allowing more space inside for driver and occupants, including more leg, shoulder and headroom, and easier access for rear passengers.\n\nIt has more aerodynamic styling, a bolder grille, with a choice from launch of two non-metallic and ten metallic shades including the new Portimao Blue metallic unique to the top-selling M Sport trim.\n\nYou can call me HAL Fans of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s classic sci-fi movie 2001 \u2013A Space Odyssey may well remember the talking computer, HAL 9000, with which the crew could converse as it carried out orders on their behalf. BMW\u2019s new 7th generation 3-Series saloon has its own voice-command personal assistant system, which you can personalise by reprograming it to respond to a name of your choice, rather than the generic opener: \u2018Hey BMW\u2019. So in honour of Kubrick\u2019s landmark film, I called mine \u2018HAL\u2019. And sure enough, when I called out \u2018Hey HAL\u2019, to change music tracks, radio channel or ask a question, HAL would respond. However, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a question of a German car losing something in translation, but it did struggle a bit with some commands. Maybe it was accents or pronunciation. In the movie, of course, HAL decided that the only way it could complete the spaceship\u2019s mission was to kill off the crew. Thankfully, at no point did our HAL suggest that.\n\nIn a piece of good news, security has been beefed up with a new movement sensor in the key which switches off the transmitting signal from the fob and puts it into stand-by mode when it is static on a table, for example, removing the risk of the signal being picked up by thieves using their own electronic relay devices.\n\nThe new 3-Series also promises more clever equipment as standard including LED lights which predict corners, reversing camera, three-zone air conditioning and enhanced acoustic glazing. Wheels on the base SE model are 17 inch as standard with an optional 18 inch.\n\nThe mid-range Sport model adds 18-inch wheels as standard, as well as high gloss interior and exterior, and driver and passenger heated leather seats, and two options for sports suspension.\n\nThe top of the range M Sport adds more bling and features as standard a 12.3 inch digital instrument cluster plus a 10.3 inch central cluster.\n\nOptions have been \u2018dramatically simplified\u2019 says BMW, and grouped into six main packages, including M Sport Plus, Technology, Comfort, Premium and Driving Assistant Professional.\n\nIn terms of driver comfort, the head-up display has been improved and made easier to read and gesture control enhanced.\n\nA handy Parking Assistant feature includes a Reversing Assistant, which offers automated reversing in confined spaces where the driver does not have a clear view, such as in a multi-storey car park or an entrance to a courtyard.\n\nBut despite all the sensible stuff, the 3 Series remains a sprightly engaging drive.
