Of course, most of those obstacles are put there by their own relatives, their communities\u2019 ignorant belief systems and by society enabling exploitative cultural practices.\n\nWhich is why this story of a boarding school is so compelling. Not any boarding school, but one in Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, where three young women \u2013 Umohoza Hurlarain, Nyamam Gai Gatluak \u2013 and Mumina Khalif, were given the opportunity to go to school. They are among those who lead and force change \u2013 like their sisters in the environmental movement.\n\nThe trio were among the lucky 60 of 500 who vied for places at the camp\u2019s one boarding school for girls, Angelina Jolie Primary School. The three and their fellow pupils are now safe and will be enabled to reach their potential.\n\naccording to a Unicef report entitled A Familiar Face: Violence in the Lives of Children and Adolescents, the dangers to too many children \u2013 and predominantly girls \u2013 are at home.\n\nNyamam says: \u201cThose who make it to school, when they come home, they have to leave the books and go to the kitchen to cook and do chores because boys don\u2019t do such work. So the girls don\u2019t get time to study. Being in a boarding school is a privilege.\u201d\n\n\n\nSexist chores are the least of it \u2013 according to a Unicef report entitled A Familiar Face: Violence in the Lives of Children and Adolescents, the dangers to too many children \u2013 and predominantly girls \u2013 are at home. The study looked at children\u2019s experience of violence in 30 countries and found that three in four children aged two to four worldwide regularly experience violent discipline by their caregivers. About six in 10 are punished by physical means. Perhaps even more terrifying worldwide, one in four children under the age of five live with a mother who is a victim of intimate partner violence.\n\nThe theme for the day this year was Girlforce: Unscripted and Unstoppable. The unscripted is true in so many places, where 12 million girls are married before they are 18; 130 million girls do not go to school; and 15 million girls between the ages of 15 and 19 experience \u201cforced sex\u201d \u2013 which is rape.\n\nWhere relatives, communities and societies continue to deny the full and equal rights of girls and women, young women like Nyamam and her friends will write the script: \u201cWe want to work together when we grow up to make learning easier for girls.\u201d\n\nThe emancipation of women and girls is unstoppable and stories like these remind us to drown out the drone of the dying patriarchy and remember that the future is female. It\u2019s inevitable.", "description": "Friday was International Day of the Girl Child, so there were lots of uplifting stories about girls overcoming obstacles to succeed and thrive.
