Going to miss you Rhoda Morgenstern!\"\n\nHarper was 80 years old, and a cause of death is not yet known. In January 2013, Harper was diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a rare condition that occurs when cancer cells spread into the fluid-filled membrane surrounding the brain, though she continued to promote her book and even danced in season 17 of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" That August, she told NBC that she was \"close to a remission.\"\n\n\"Spontaneous remission lives as a possibility,\" she said. \"I think infinite possibility is beautiful in every area. A lot of stuff that looks impossible is not.\"\n\nA beautiful woman, a wonderful actress, a great friend and with balls bigger than mine.
