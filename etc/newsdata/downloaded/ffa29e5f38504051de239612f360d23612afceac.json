She said she felt a sense of injustice because she could see and feel that people were running from families like hers as a child, remarking that she and her brother had friends of all races when they first moved in.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere were no gang fights, there were no territorial battles. Yet one by one, they packed their bags and they ran from us. And they left communities in shambles,\u201d she said during her time of plugging the Obama Presidential Center to be built in the historic Jackson Park, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nAD\n\nThe former first lady said she\u2019s still noticing patterns of white flight in Chicago as immigrant families settle in neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cYou were running from us and you\u2019re still running, because we\u2019re no different than the immigrant families that are moving in, the families in Pilsen, the families that are coming from other places to try to do better,\u201d she said to applause.\n\nAD\n\nThe city of Chicago, which is in the second most populous county in the country, is seeing an increase in its Asian and Hispanic residents and a decrease in white and black residents, the Chicago Sun-Times reported in June.\n\nThe first lady, whose appearance was criticized during her husband\u2019s term in office, said differences in skin color and hair texture divide countries and are \u201cartificial things that don\u2019t even touch on the values that people bring to life,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2015 Obama gave remarks to graduates at historically black Tuskegee University, where she mentioned the racist assumptions of greatness and insults that she and her husband faced before and during his presidency. The uphill battle that the graduates would likely face because of their race was a \u201cheavy burden to carry,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nThe negative and racist critiques the Obamas experienced still had a positive outline, she said at Tuesday\u2019s summit.\n\n\u201cBeing the first black first family gave America and the world an opportunity to see the truth of who we are as black people: That we are just as and often better than the people who doubt us,\u201d she said in a BBC video.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Former first lady Michelle Obama reflected on her time growing up in Chicago's South Side neighborhood and witnessing white flight \u2014 something she still sees today.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HTJ5OgAMqU9Us50k5acQycFDQSo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PDKC5VX2PQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
