Punitive duties on soybeans, the biggest U.S. export to China, and thousands of other items were left unchanged.\n\n\u201cThe exemption could be seen as a gesture of sincerity towards the U.S. ahead of negotiations in October but is probably more a means of supporting the economy,\u201d Iris Pang of ING said in a report.\n\nWord that talks are going ahead has helped calm jittery financial markets. But there has been no sign of progress.\n\nThe two governments \u201care unlikely to reach a deal this year,\u201d said Pang.\n\nBeijing\u2019s earlier tariff hikes avoided processor chips and other U.S. technology required by Chinese industry.\n\nChinese leaders are resisting U.S. pressure to roll back plans for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other industries.\n\nWashington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those plans violate China\u2019s market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology.\n\nWashington and Beijing have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s products. That has battered farmers and manufacturers on both sides and fueled fears a global economy that already was showing signs of a slowdown might tip into recession.\n\nTrump has imposed or announced penalties on about $550 billion of Chinese products, or almost everything the United States buys from China. Tariffs of 25% imposed previously on $250 billion of Chinese goods are due to rise to 30% on Oct. 1.\n\nChina has raised duties on about $120 billion of U.S. products, economists estimate. Some have been hit with increases more than once, while about $50 billion of U.S. goods is unaffected, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries.\n\nIn their latest escalation, Washington imposed 15% tariffs on $112 billion of Chinese products on Sept. 1 and is planning to hit another $160 billion Dec. 15. Beijing responded by imposing duties of 10% and 5% on a range of American goods.\n\nProducts covered by Wednesday\u2019s exemptions include lubricants, insecticides and whey and fish meal for animal feed.\n\nChinese imports of U.S. goods tumbled 22.5% in August from a year earlier and exports to the United States, China\u2019s biggest foreign market, fell 16%.\n\nBeijing has agreed to narrow its politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States but is reluctant to give up development strategies it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\n\nTalks broke down in May over how to enforce any agreement.\n\nChina insists Trump\u2019s punitive tariffs must be lifted once a deal takes effect. Washington says at least some must stay to make sure Beijing carries out any promises.\n\nSome analysts suggest Beijing might be holding out in hopes Trump will feel pressure to make a more favorable deal as his campaign for the 2020 presidential election picks up. Trump has warned China will face a tougher U.S. negotiating stance if he is re-elected.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "China on Wednesday announced it will exempt American industrial grease and some other imports from tariff hikes in a trade war with Washington but kept in place penalties on soybeans and other major U.S. exports ahead of negotiations next month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/china_us_trade_43239_c0-0-5000-2915_s1770x1032.jpg?6c2b7248ec82393b339337b8d575750b2ecd0989", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
