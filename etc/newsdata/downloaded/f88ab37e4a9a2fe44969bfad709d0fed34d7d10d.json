Some of the 22 survivors of the accident testified passengers included 15 Tunisians, as well as West African migrants.\n\nAuthorities say the Italian Coast Guard has recovered 13 bodies, all of them women, who came from Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Guinea. International Organization for Migration spokesman Joel Millman says 17 migrants remain missing, including more women and at least two children. He says the missing are believed to be nationals of Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Guinea Conakry and Tunisia.\n\n\"IOM's Missing Migrants Project reported Monday that these deaths bring to 15,750 the total number of dead, on this particular central Mediterranean route since Jan. 1, 2014. This is approximately 10 times the total lost on the Mediterranean's eastern corridor linking the Middle East to Greece, and almost the same multiple of all deaths on the western route linking North Africa to Spain,\" Millman said.\n\n", "description": "Migrant Deaths in Mediterranean This Year Top 1,000", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/09/2019100900383_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
