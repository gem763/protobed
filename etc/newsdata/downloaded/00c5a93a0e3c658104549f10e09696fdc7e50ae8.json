The RAF base is one of the most important bases run by America in Europe.\n\nA 42-year-old American wife of a senior US diplomat is being treated as a suspect in their investigations, but she has fled.\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, was killed on August 27 in a car crash near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire\n\nWhile speaking on the BBC's PM programme this afternoon, his mother Charlotte Charles pleaded 'from me, as a mum, to her, as a mum' for the woman to return to face justice.\n\nShe said: 'He was a twin, His twin now doesn't know who he is.\n\n'We're really hoping to try to get her back; from me, as a mum, to her, as a mum, you just hope that he [Dominic Raab] can try to get through to her that we don't understand how she can just get on a plane and leave our family just utterly devastated.'\n\nMr Dunn is pictured with his mother Charlotte Charles. Ms Charles said: 'We're not going to let it rest. This boy of ours was just too important'\n\nShe added: 'We're not going to let it rest. This boy of ours was just too important.\n\n'If we don't get any luck over here, then we will go over there.\n\n'Harry's stepdad, my husband, is a US citizen. A couple of weeks or more after we'd lost Harry we let the police know that Bruce, my husband, was a US citizen, in the hope that that would help matters.'\n\nHis mother also revealed that Mr Dunn is a twin, and 'his twin now doesn't know who he is' following his brother's death.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News earlier today, Ms Charles called on the US President to take action.\n\nShe said: 'President Trump, please listen.

He was such a precious young man who was loved by all who knew him.\n\n'Our lives have been shattered and our only crumb of comfort is the news that Harry was riding perfectly safely that night. He was not at fault in any way.'\n\nIt was reported in initial findings by police were that Harry had been driving on the correct side of the road when a woman in a car pulled off of the airbase\n\nThe car hit Harry (pictured when he was younger) head-on and he died soon after in hospital after suffering multiple injuries\n\nShe added: 'However, with the terrible news that the other driver has left the country, seemingly in an attempt to evade justice, we are totally deprived of the ability to grieve and our lives are now painfully on hold.\n\n'I bear the other driver no ill will. She must be suffering too given what she did, but she must return to the UK to face justice. It is only at that point that my family and I will be able to begin to put our lives back together and move forward from this needless tragedy.'\n\nMr Dunn added: 'I echo everything Charlotte says. The pain of our family's loss is unbearable. My son was taken from us at such a tender age doing what he loved doing the most in life.\n\n'We call on the driver and the American authorities to have her come back to the UK to face the legal consequences of her dangerous driving that night.\n\nTributes have been left for Harry following the crash near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on August 27\n\n'It is in no one's interests for her not to do so and would set a terrible precedent if she does not return.'\n\nIt was reported in initial findings by police that Harry had been driving on the correct side of the road when a woman in a car pulled off of the airbase on to the wrong side of the carriageway.\n\nThe car hit Harry head-on and he died soon after in hospital after suffering multiple injuries.\n\nSky News has reported that the suspect involved is the wife of a US diplomat who quickly claimed diplomatic immunity following the incident.\n\nThe car hit Harry head-on and he died soon after in hospital after suffering multiple injuries\n\nShe told Sky News: 'Everyone loved him, we're utterly broken inside and out, everything hurts day and night, it's an effort to do anything, I ache from it, every limb, every internal organ hurts.\n\n'We don't know how we can start to grieve for him.\n\n'We have nothing. No justice. We have nothing to put our minds at rest that she's even remorseful.'\n\nSuperintendent Sarah Johnson said: 'Northamptonshire Police followed all of its usual procedures following the incident, including liaising closely with the suspect, who engaged fully with us at the time and had previously confirmed to us that she had no plans to leave the country in the near future.\n\n'Due process was also followed in seeking the necessary documentation to allow for the arrest and formal interview of the suspect, and the force is now exploring all opportunities through diplomatic channels to ensure that the investigation continues to progress.\n\n'We are also working closely with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office in an effort to come to a resolution regarding this matter.\n\n'Harry Dunn's family deserve justice and in order to achieve this, a full and thorough investigation, with the assistance of all parties involved, needs to take place.\n\n'Northamptonshire Police is committed to ensuring justice for Harry and specially trained officers continue to support the Dunn family in their loss, including keeping them fully informed of all developments in the investigation.'\n\nTop diplomatic officials are immune from prosecution under diplomatic immunity, as are their deputies and families.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police had attempted to apply a waiver that would allow them to continue to investigate and conduct interviews.\n\nBut this application was declined.\n\nA US Embassy spokesman has said questions over any waiver of immunity in the case of the wife of a US diplomat who left the UK after becoming a suspect in a fatal road crash would be 'considered carefully'.\n\nThe embassy spokesman said: 'We express our deepest sympathies and offer condolences to the family of the deceased in this tragic traffic accident.\n\n'Any questions regarding a waiver of the immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry; immunity is rarely waived.\n\n'The US Embassy has been and will continue to be in close contact with appropriate British officials.'\n\nShe had reportedly pulled on to the wrong side of the carriageway as she left the junction\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab became aware of the incident and said: 'I wish to offer my condolences to the family affected by this tragic incident.\n\n'I have called the US Ambassador to express the UK's disappointment with their decision and to urge the Embassy to re-consider it.'\n\nIn its own statement provided to Sky News, the US Embassy in London offered its 'deepest sympathies' to Mr Dunn's family following the accident 'involving a vehicle driven by the spouse of a US diplomat assigned to the United Kingdom'.\n\nIt added: 'Embassy officials are in close contact with the appropriate British officials on this matter.\n\n'Due to security and privacy considerations, we cannot confirm the identity of the individuals involved, but we can confirm the family has left the UK.'\n\nThe family's local MP Andrea Leadsom posted a statement to Twitter on Friday.\n\nThe business secretary said: 'This is an utter tragedy and my heart goes out to the family and friends of Harry Dunn, who rightly want to get the justice he deserves.\n\n'I have spoken to the Foreign Secretary and to Stephen Mold, Northants PCC, who have promised to do everything they can to get justice done.'\n\nHarry's parents have received a letter of condolence from US Ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson.\n\nIn it he said that 'it is with profound sadness' that he offered his condolences to the family but Mr Johnson made no reference to responsibility.", "description": "Harry Dunn, 19, was killed in August near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.
