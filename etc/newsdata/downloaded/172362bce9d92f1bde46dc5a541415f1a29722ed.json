(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nUnder questioning from lawmakers Wednesday, the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s second-in-command strongly disputed the conclusions of an internal government watchdog that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing\u2019s 737 Max were underqualified.\n\nDeputy FAA Administrator Daniel K. Elwell also rejected the watchdog\u2019s finding that his agency had misled Congress over the issue, saying that was \u201cnot what happened.\u201d\n\nElwell acknowledged there was ambiguity in certain agency training rules that could have been a problem for a different aircraft. But he told members of a House Appropriations subcommittee that making any connection between that problem and the 737 Max was \u201csimply not accurate.\u201d\n\n[FAA misled Congress on inspector training for Boeing 737 Max, investigators say]\n\n\u201cAbsolutely no pilots working on the 737 Max certification were unqualified,\u201d Elwell said. \u201cThey were all fully qualified for their activities.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistleblower complaints, shared its findings with Congress on Monday.\n\n\n\nHuguette Debets, who lost her husband Jackson Musoni in the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash, is comforted by Michael Stumo, the father of Samya Rose Stumo, who was also killed in the crash, as Deputy FAA Administrator Daniel K.

Kerner wrote that the \u201cFAA\u2019s official responses to Congress appear to have been misleading in their portrayal of FAA employee training and competency.\u201d\n\nInformation provided by the FAA \u201cobfuscates\u201d concerns about the preparation of safety inspectors and \u201cdiverts attention away from the likely truth of the matter: that they were neither qualified under agency policy to certify pilots flying the 737 Max nor to assess pilot training on procedures and maneuvers,\u201d the letter said.\n\nElwell offered to meet with lawmakers after Wednesday\u2019s hearing to go over in greater detail why he rejected the special counsel\u2019s conclusions.\n\nNonetheless, the findings have added to questions about the FAA\u2019s oversight of the 737 Max, which the agency had certified as safe before two of the planes crashed within five months of each other, first in Indonesia and then in Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia, killing 346 people.\n\nThe 737 Max has been grounded since several days after the March 10 crash in Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia. The FAA and international aviation safety regulators are awaiting fixes by Boeing and will conduct additional tests and reviews before deciding when the planes should be allowed to fly again.\n\nElwell acknowledged the family and friends of some of the crash victims who attended Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\n\nFAA officials face scrutiny over Boeing oversight\n\n\u201cWe at the FAA acknowledge your pain and your loss,\u201d Elwell said.\n\nHe also reiterated that no timetable has been set for ungrounding the 737 Max.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we continue to evaluate Boeing\u2019s software modification, and we are still developing necessary training requirements,\u201d Elwell said in his opening remarks. \u201cThis work is not following any prescribed timeline. As we\u2019ve said repeatedly, the 737 Max will not return to service for U.S. carriers and in U.S. airspace until the FAA\u2019s analysis of the facts and technical data indicate that it is safe to do so.\u201d\n\nThe 737 Max crashes drew scrutiny to an FAA program that handed much of the responsibility for determining whether Boeing was complying with safety standards over to the company itself, and shook international confidence in the FAA.\n\nAgency leaders have defended the process and their approach to safety, but a number of internal and external reviews are underway and the FAA has sought to work with international regulators ahead of allowing the jets to fly again.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s criminal division also is looking into the 737 Max, along with a congressional committee, and the Transportation Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General.\n\nRep. David E. Price (D-N.C.), chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on transportation, housing and urban development, and related agencies, said the crashes had called into question a safety certification process once considered the global \u201cgold standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are also many legitimate questions surrounding the certification process and the extent to which the certification process has been delegated,\u201d Price said.\n\n[With its ties in Washington, Boeing has taken over more and more of the FAA\u2019s job]\n\nElwell continued to defend the system, saying that the agency has been adequately funded and staffed and that its approach to certification had consistently produced safe airplanes.\n\n\u201cDelegation is not self-certification,\u201d Elwell said. \u201cThe FAA retains strict oversight authority.\u201d\n\nInvestigators say in both 737 Max crashes, bad information from an external sensor caused a malfunction in an automated feature on the planes designed to prevent stalls. The feature, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), repeatedly forced the noses of the planes down before they crashed.\n\nElwell said Wednesday that a redesigned version of the system would rely on two sensors and would turn on only once, rather than repeatedly.\n\nElwell also emphasized the close collaboration between the FAA and international aviation regulators reviewing the 737 Max. He disputed claims of a rift between the agencies, saying the FAA had \u201cnever been closer with our colleagues internationally.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to get it right and we have to get it right globally,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Monday, the FAA\u2019s leadership met with international aviation regulators and a senior Boeing executive in Montreal to provide an update on the agency\u2019s work to approve Boeing\u2019s fixes to the 737 Max. The meeting followed a similar one in Fort Worth in the spring.\n\nRead more:\n\nChanges to flawed Boeing 737 Max were kept from pilots, DeFazio says\n\nLong before the Max disasters, Boeing had a history of failing to fix safety problems", "description": "Deputy FAA Administrator Daniel K.
