But the Democrat instead chose to grill him about Facebook's decision not to fact check political advertisements, even in cases where messages posted by politicians are clearly wrong.\n\nShe also asked about Mr Zuckerberg's previous admission that he dines regularly with conservatives and right-wing personalities, which he said is part of his strategy to ensure he hears a diverse set of opinions.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.
