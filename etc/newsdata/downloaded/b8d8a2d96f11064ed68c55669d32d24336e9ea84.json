The duchess previously donned the lambskin leather skirt in a bottle green shade for her and Prince Harry's visit to Sussex in October last year. Anthony McGrath, celebrity stylist and lecturer at the Fashion Retail Academy in London, observed how Meghan's look is a departure from her looser, more casual attire which she sported on their recent royal tour of Africa. 'Since giving birth, we have seen Meghan sport more relaxed looks and outfits that are less figure-hugging. However, this morning, she changed things up,' he said. 'She returned to one of her go-to-looks \u2013 a pencil skirt coupled with a knit or a shirt. 'While pencil skirts may seem very 'royal-like', Meghan put her own spin on the look and gave the classic 9-to-5 skirt an update by opting for an edgy leather number - proving that pencil skirts are anything but boring. 'Not surprisingly, she pulled off the tonal-blocking trend perfectly. The berry shade is very autumnal, making it perfect for this time of year and goes very well with her olive complexion. 'Overall this look is stylish and chic and shows Meghan's flair for fashion is still perfectly in-tact.' The skirt was the same Hugo Boss number worn by Queen Letizia of Spain yesterday, which Anthony said is 'not surprising'. 'It's not the first time the two have been seen sporting very similar, if not the same, outfits,' Anthony pointed out. 'Queen Letizia wore it slightly differently as she matched her heels with the skirt rather than her top and opted for a white blouse with voluminous sleeves instead.'\n\nArriving at the Queen's Commonwealth Trust and One Young World event alongside her husband Prince Harry, 35, Meghan cut an elegant figure in the popular skirt\n\nMeghan teamed the figure-hugging piece with a plum V-neck jumper, highlighting her slender frame as she tucked it in at the waist\n\nSticking to her colour scheme, the new mother, who shares Archie Mountbatten-Windsor with her husband Harry (pictured), donned a sophisticated pair of magenta court shoes\n\nAppearing equally as elegant, Letizia, who was in South Korea with her husband King Felipe for a two-day trip, paired the brick red skirt with an on-trend pointelle-trimmed blouse.\n\nLooking typically polished, the mother-of-two sported the white high-neck blouse which boasted embroidered mesh cut out's on the sleeves.\n\nShe added a little glitz to her ensemble with some red and silver teardrop earrings and even matched her eyeshadow to her outfit, donning a maroon eye look with a subtle peach glow on her cheeks.\n\nThe fashionista further kept to her colour scheme with shining leather court heels in the same colour as her skirt and a matching clutch.\n\nLetizia (pictured with First Lady of the Republic of Korea Kim Jung-sook), who was in South Korea with her husband King Felipe for a two-day trip, paired the brick red skirt with an on-trend pointelle-trimmed blouse\n\nMeghan arrived at today's event with Harry, who made a surprise appearance, in his electric Audi E-Tron.\n\nThe couple will be joined by young leaders running projects and ventures that support equality and inclusion in countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, Iraq, Malawi and Bangladesh.\n\nThe QCT, which Meghan serves as vice-president, aims to champion, connect and fund young leaders from the 53 countries in the Commonwealth.", "description": "Arriving at the Queen's Commonwealth Trust and One Young World event in Windsor,  alongside her husband Prince Harry, 35, Meghan cut an elegant figure in a red leather Hugo Boss skirt.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/12/20175068-0-image-a-23_1572004150713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
