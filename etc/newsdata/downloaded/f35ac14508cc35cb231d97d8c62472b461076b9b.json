What\u2019s really important is how you manage that talent if you have it. This is as important as the talent itself.\u201d\n\nElie Saab\n\nFashion Designer\n\nTaking the wild out of the west with a modern tribute to the nomadic and picturesque Sonora region | The ELIESAAB Pre-Fall 2018 collection available at boutiques starting June 2018 #WestboudDetourpic.twitter.com/GMW7c1lA90 \u2014 ELIE SAAB (@ElieSaabWorld) February 1, 2018\n\nDaleen Hassan, Euronews: \u201cDo you think fashion can create a dialogue between the Middle East and the West?\n\nElie Saab :\u201cElie Saab fashion has no borders, it is a universal language spoken by all people. It is a self-contained art, like cinema and its language is beauty.\u201d\n\nEuronews: \u201cSo, do you consider yourself to be the godfather of this dialogue?\u201d\n\nElie Saab: \u201cOf course. I have influenced people, especially the Arab youth. When I started to become known internationally, or even before then, the first day I started as a fashion designer I had a bigger goal. This profession is never easy and I\u2019m certainly glad to be in the position I find myself today. Now, it is normal for me to be a bridge between the Middle East and the rest of the world. I want the Middle East to have its own say when it comes to international fashion. I see that young people in the region are talented, they just need opportunities.\u201d\n\nEuronews: \u201c I am quoting you, \u201ctalent alone is not enough to shape the designer but relentless work and determination\u201d. Do you think that the new generation shares this view?\u201d\n\nElie Saab:\u201cTo be talented is not enough. What\u2019s really important is how you manage that talent if you have it. This is as important as the talent itself. Unfortunately, there are too many young people who get drunk with the first shot of success.\n\nActually, this is the enemy of any success one might achieve. I believe success is a collection of many things which are built step by step in order to reach a stage of continuous and permanent success.\u201d\n\nEuronews:\u201cSo it\u2019s a accumulated process.\u201d\n\nElie Saab:\u201cExactly, success is based on a series of achievements, I don\u2019t believe in instant success.\u201d\n\nDripping in couture | ELIESAAB Haute Couture Spring Summer 2018 #ParisEstUneF\u00eatepic.twitter.com/CxAq7NzDMr \u2014 ELIE SAAB (@ElieSaabWorld) February 4, 2018\n\nEuronews: \u201cWhen you first started in Europe you faced many challenges. Today Europe is one of the most important centres for your brand. What have you taken from this experience?\u201d\n\nElie Saab: \u201cIt was difficult. Entering the international market in the beginning was hard. When I first started in Europe, no one had ever heard of me,,,,,they didn\u2019t know this person from the Middle East who was designing haute couture, bringing together collections. This was a challenge, especially when I started in Rome in 1996. While I was very well known in the Arab world, I had to start from scratch when I came to Europe. Now when I look back, I can see that I have opened the door for many young people entering this industry.\u201d\n\nEuronews: \u201cIn your opinion, how does Europe view the young Arab generation, especially after the recent refugee crisis? Are they seen today as a burden or another source of culture?\u201d\n\nElie Saab: \u201cMost young Arab people are talented and hard working. They can be a really positive asset, wherever they are. If Europe pays attention to this, it will really benefit from the presence of Arab refugees, most of whom are creative. Maybe now they are going through some difficulties, however, most of them are ready to learn and will be a real asset wherever they are\u201d\n\nEuronews: \u201cHow do you combine being a creative designer and an entrepreneur?\u201d\n\nElie Saab: \u201cFrom the very first day I started, business was in my blood. I do not like to design fashion items just for the purpose of design and creativity. I like to see my designs worn by the largest number of women in the world. Elie Saab is a very big group now. I do not believe we would be in this position if I hadn\u2019t managed the company in a commercial way. The fashion industry creates a lot of job opportunities. It is a new industry here in the Middle East. There are a lot of investors putting money into fashion, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world \u2013 they are willing to finance it.\u201d\n\nEuronews: \u201cWe are seeing a lot of Asian investment in major European brands, such as Versace and Valentino, which were bought by Qatar and China? What do you think about this?\u201d\n\nElie Saab: \u201cFashion firms are like banks. If we do not think about them this way, they will fail and disappear. For example, when the Qataris invested, they put a lot of money into Valentino. They took it to another level. They pumped a lot of money into the company quickly. That has resulted in Valentino finding itself in the position it is now.\u201d\n\nEuronews: \u201cHow do you make the balance between the artistic vision in your designs and specific cultural tendencies?\u201d\n\nElie Saab: \u201cI think that\u2019s in the past. Today the beauty of a design is its ability to impress all cultures. What\u2019s important is that the designer keeps his own line, identity and remains the same.\u201d\n\nDaleen Hassan: So, how would you define luxury?\n\nElie Saab: Luxury is everything which cannot be bought with money. We cannot buy everything we would wish. Just think about those things that people dream about having but they are unable to buy them even though money is no object.\u201d\n\nEuronews:\u201cHow would you like to be remembered?\n\nElie Saab:\u201cHonestly I\u2019d love to be remembered. In fact, I think the time you are remembered posthumously is much longer than the time when you were alive.\u201d\n\nEuronews: \u201cElie Saab Thank you very much for being with us.\u201d\n\nElie Saab: \u201cThank you.\u201d", "description": "The Lebanese fashion designer discusses his global success and his impact on world fashion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/430833/1000x563_430833.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-06"}
