Goodenough, 97, an engineering professor at the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham, 77, a chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Akira Yoshino, 71, of chemical company Asahi Kasei Corp. and Meijo University in Japan.\n\nA screen displays the portraits of the laureates of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (L-R) John B.

The success and failure of so many new technologies depends on the batteries,\u2019 said Alexej Jerschow, a chemist at New York University, whose research focuses on the lithium-ion battery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoodenough, who is considered an intellectual giant of solid state chemistry and physics, is the oldest person to ever win a Nobel Prize \u2013 edging out Arthur Ashkin, who was 96 when he was awarded the Nobel for physics last year.\n\nGoodenough said he is grateful he was not forced to retire at age 65.\n\n\u2018So I\u2019ve had an extra 33 years to keep working,\u2019 he told reporters in London, where he was to accept another prize.\n\nAmerican professor and solid-state physicist, John Goodenough, is 97 years old (Getty)\n\nThe three scientists each had unique breakthroughs that laid the foundation for the development of a commercial rechargeable battery, an alternative to older alkaline batteries containing lead, nickel or zinc that had their origins in the 19th century.\n\nAll batteries store chemical energy that can be converted into electricity. But earlier batteries were unsafe, too heavy or not rechargeable \u2013 limiting their practical use\n\nIn the 1970s, Whittingham, who had researched superconductors at Stanford University, was hired by Exxon at a time when the petroleum giant was investing in research on energy storage. Whittingham harnessed the tendency of lithium \u2013 the lightest metal \u2013 to give away its electrons to make a lightweight battery capable of generating just over two volts.\n\nBy 1980, building on Whittingham\u2019s work, Goodenough had doubled the capacity of the battery to four volts by using cobalt oxide in the cathode \u2013 one of two electrodes, along with the anode, that make up the ends of a battery. But that battery remained too unstable for general commercial use. That\u2019s where Yoshino\u2019s work in the 1980s came in. He eliminated the volatile pure lithium from the battery, and instead opted for lithium ions that are safer. He added another material in one electrode that reduced the potential for fires.\n\nM. Stanley Whittingham, poses with the Einstein medal, he now has a Nobel Prize to add to that (AFP)\n\nThis step paved the way for the first lightweight, safe, durable and rechargeable commercial batteries to be built and enter the market in 1991.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe three winners will share a 9-million kronor (\u00a3750,000) cash award. Their gold medals and diplomas will be conferred in Stockholm on Dec. 10 \u2013 the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel\u2019s death in 1896.\n\n\u2018Lithium-ion itself is still full of unknowns,\u2019 said Yoshino, who said he visits Goodenough nearly every year in Texas.\n\nAkira Yoshino holds a model of a lithium-ion battery and a flower bouquet during a press conference on October 9, 2019 in Tokyo, Japan. (Getty)\n\n\u2018For him, I\u2019m like his son,\u2019 he said. \u2018He takes very good care of me.\u2019\n\nGoodenough, in his own way, seemed to return the favor, telling reporters that in all of his 97 years: \u2018What am I most proud of? I don\u2019t know, I would say all my friends.\u2019", "description": "John B. Goodenough, M.
