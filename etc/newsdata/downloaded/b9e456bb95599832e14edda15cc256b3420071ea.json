ISIS (Islamic State) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was dead after Delta Force commandos cornered him at his northern Syrian lair.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq,\u201d Trump said in an October 24 speech. \u201cAnd I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us.\u201d\n\nA joint Turkish-Iraqi intelligence operation reportedly helped lead to al-Baghdadi\u2019s location. After the raid, Turkey detained twenty foreigners affiliated with ISIS.\n\nBut the location of al-Baghdadi\u2019s death\u2014and the people who had sheltered him\u2014underscored serious questions about Turkey\u2019s role in Syria. Idlib Province, where al-Baghdadi was hiding, is under the control of Syrian rebel groups, many of them Turkish-backed. And al-Baghdadi was finally cornered at a village called Barisha, less than three miles from the border with Turkey.\n\nHis location in Barisha had been known for more than three months, according to New York Times reporter Rukmini Callimachi.\n\nTwo days after al-Baghdadi's death, U.S. forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) may have carried out additional raids against ISIS figures inside Turkish-controlled parts of Syria. SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said that \u201ca joint operation with American airdrop...targeted ISIS mercenaries\u201d outside of Jarabulus. Earlier, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that \u201cunidentified helicopters\u201d had carried out a raid in the area.\n\nSyrian Kurdish diplomat Sinam Mohamad confirmed the report, adding that \"[t]hey targeted another ISIS member in Afrin,\" another Syrian town that Turkish-backed forces captured from the SDF in early 2018.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. operation three miles from Turkey.
