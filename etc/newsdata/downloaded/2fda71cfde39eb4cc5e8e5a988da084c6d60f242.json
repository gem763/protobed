REUTERS/Gary He\n\nIn an interview with Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, Smith said that other countries such as New Zealand were passing laws in the wake of events like the mass murder in Christchurch earlier this year.\n\nThe murder of 51 people at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand was streamed on major online platforms including Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube. The companies raced to take down the videos, but they were still available for more than a day.\n\n\u201cThe laws around the world are going to change, and because technology is so global, American companies will adopt a new approach even if the United States Congress does nothing,\u201d he said. Smith spoke to Reuters as part of a tour to promote his recently released book, \u201cTools and Weapons.\u201d\n\nSection 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act of 1996, protects tech companies from being sued for what users of their online platforms upload. But Smith said the law, critical to enabling the expansion of internet services and social media, should now be revisited.\n\nTechnology companies, he said, should have a \u201cnew level of responsibility\u201d for what is said on their sites.\n\nSmith, who was promoted to Microsoft president in 2015, the first time the company had filled the role in more than a decade, has since become the company\u2019s public face on controversial intersections between technology and society.\n\nHe also said tech companies have a responsibility to work together to help bridge the so-called digital divide, where rural Americans often lack broadband internet access, calling it \u201cthe technological underpinning for many of the major social, economic and political issues of the day.\u201d\n\nFACIAL RECOGNITION\n\nThe technology industry\u2019s responsibility to society was a theme in the discussion and in his new book. Smith said the industry should not enable governments to engage in cyber attacks.\n\nHe said Microsoft has turned down government requests for facial recognition software in cases where it fears misuse and will never sell the technology for surveillance.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t sell facial recognition services for the purposes of mass surveillance anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nMicrosoft has called for stronger regulation of facial recognition technology, which has been used in China to track ethnic minorities.\n\nSmith stopped short for calling for an outright ban on the technology, saying that Microsoft believes it has valid uses and has argued that governments should move faster to regulate it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to innovate if you can\u2019t use something, and it\u2019s hard to learn if you can\u2019t innovate,\u201d Smith said.", "description": "Microsoft Corp President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said on Friday that U.S. tech companies will change how they moderate online platforms in response to new laws from foreign governments, regardless of whether U.S. lawmakers take action.", "authors": ["Sheila", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429496276&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1R9", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
