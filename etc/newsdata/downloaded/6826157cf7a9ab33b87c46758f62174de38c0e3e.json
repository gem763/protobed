He made the announcement near to the site of a gun rampage last year, when Faisal Hussain shot 15 people, killing two.\n\n\u201cAs long as Canadians are losing their loved ones to gun violence, not enough has changed,\u201d said Trudeau of the proposed ban. \u201cWe know you do not need a military-grade assault weapon, one designed to kill the largest amount of people in the shortest amount of time, to take down a deer.\u201d\n\nThe move to heavily restrict certain firearms is likely to set up a fight between the Liberals, Conservatives and the gun lobby. But after his embarrassing week, Trudeau is likely to be keen to move past the events that left his campaign team scrambling.\n\nEven Donald Trump weighed in on the scandal, telling reporters in the Oval office on Friday he was \u201csurprised\u201d by the \u201cnumber of times\u201d Trudeau appeared in photos.\n\nAfter issuing his second apology on Thursday, the prime minister was unable to say how many times he used brownface \u2013 or if more images might surface.\n\nJustin Trudeau's brownface scandal is bad. But voting him out isn't the solution | Moustafa Bayoumi Read more\n\n\u201cI am wary of being definitive about this,\u201d said Trudeau, telling reporters he didn\u2019t admit to the third instance because he didn\u2019t remember it occurring. \u201cThe fact is that I didn\u2019t understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day. I have always acknowledged that I come from a place of privilege but I now need to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blind spot.\u201d\n\nTwo days after the first image was published by Time magazine, the Liberal party has circled the wagons around their leader; there have been no public calls for Trudeau to step down and numerous candidates have expressed support for the prime minister, while also acknowledging the offensive nature of the incident.\n\n\u201cI think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for diversity,\u201d said Greg Fergus, a member of the federal Black Caucus and a Liberal MP, on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe Justin Trudeau I have come to know over the past four years is a champion of diversity and inclusion,\u201d said Amarjeet Sohi in a tweet.\n\nFollowing the firearms announcement, it is unclear if the policy announcement \u2013 in which Trudeau accused Conservatives of looking to \u201cgut\u201d the country\u2019s gun laws \u2013 will force parties to shift gears or to continue their attack on the prime minister for the photographs.\n\nThe leader of the Conservative party, Andrew Scheer, has previously said Trudeau has lost the \u201cmoral authority\u201d to govern following the prime minister\u2019s two apologies for the racist images.\n\nA unified party front is critical for the prime minister: as Trudeau looks to renew his parliamentary majority in an upcoming federal election, opinion polls shows him in a tight race against his Conservative rival, but the prime minister still holds in projected seats.\n\nDespite trading barbs on the campaign trail, the leaders have yet to face each other on the debate stage. Trudeau skipped the first event in mid-September, opting instead to hold a campaign rally. The leaders will meet for the first time on 7 October, in advance of the 21 October election.", "description": "Canadian PM unveils pledge to restrict handguns on re-election campaign trail in Toronto", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco", "Moustafa Bayoumi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0696800719497e0bfd6f1f19ebc69c1733c8eecb/159_0_4610_2768/master/4610.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7454b43657a0e31a14a76d076974ac1f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
