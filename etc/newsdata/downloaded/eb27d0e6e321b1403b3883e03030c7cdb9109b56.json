PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - CC Sabathia impressed his manager and teammates in his first regular-season relief appearance.\n\nThe 39-year-old left-hander, who is retiring at the end of the season, worked a perfect fourth inning in the New York Yankees\u2019 2-1, 12-inning loss Tuesday night to the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nSabathia had made 560 regular season starts but is being moved to the bullpen along with J.A. Happ ahead of the postseason.\n\n\u201cI thought he threw a lot of good cutters to their righties,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cGood that he was able to walk in from the bullpen, which is unique for him. And then talking to him, once he was out there, he was normal.\u201d\n\nSabathia will come out of the bullpen again in a game this weekend at Texas for the AL East champions.\n\n\u201cSo good first step,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHopefully he bounces back well from it tomorrow and then we\u2019ll try it again in Arlington.\u201d\n\nSabathia struck out Travis d\u2019Arnaud, induced a groundout from Choi and retired Matt Duffy on a called third strike.\n\n\u201cI think it was impressive,\u201d Yankees reliever Chad Green said. \u201cFor that to be the first time he\u2019s gone in for one inning and to lock in like that, it was fun to watch.\u201d\n\nSabathia did not talk with reporters after the game.\n\nHis only prior big league relief appearance was in Game 5 of the 2011 AL Division Series against Detroit, when he entered to start the fifth inning with New York trailing 2-0. Sabathia allowed one run, two hits and two walks with four strikeouts over 1 1/3 innings in the Yankees\u2019 3-2 loss.\n\nSabathia received a standing ovation as he walked toward the dugout after the inning from a large group of Yankees\u2019 fans among the announced crowd of 16,699. Duffy\u2019s strikeout was Sabathia\u2019s 1,700 with the Yankees.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really change that much,\u201d New York catcher Austin Romine said. \u201cThe game is slow for him. He showed what he can do.\u201d\n\nWith Sabathia\u2019s outing, the active leader for the most regular-season starts without pitching out of the bullpen is Houston\u2019s Justin Verlander with 452.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "CC Sabathia impressed his manager and teammates in his first regular-season relief appearance.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Didtler"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/yankees_rays_baseball_25404_c0-96-4381-2650_s1770x1032.jpg?1977f88bf6cd275591f8f6821e4c1d461380170d", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
