In a statement, he said that \"at no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.\"\n\nFollowing his morning testimony, Maguire will speak to the Senate intelligence panel behind closed doors.\n\nINTEL CHIEF MAGUIRE DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, CALLS ISSUE 'UNPRECEDENTED'\n\nSo who is Joseph Maguire?\n\nMaguire is the acting director of national intelligence, the Cabinet-level official who leads the United States Intelligence Community.

He retired from the U.S. Navy after a 36-year career that included leading the Naval Special Warfare Command. Maguire also served as the president and CEO of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMaguire attended Manhattan College for his bachelor's degree, and earned his master's degree in National Security Affairs from the Naval Postgraduate School in California, according to Maguire's biography.\n\nThere was some controversy leading up to his appointment. President Trump had announced Maguire's appointment via tweet following the resignation of Sue Gordon from the DNI.
