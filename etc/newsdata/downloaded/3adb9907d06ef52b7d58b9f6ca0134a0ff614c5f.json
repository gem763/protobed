Officials recently confirmed eight deaths and 530 cases of serious lung disease tied to vaping. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised people to consider not vaping as it investigates the cause of the illnesses, while also warning smokers who vape not to return to smoking cigarettes.\n\n\"So far, the available evidence still suggests that when compared to smoking, vaping is a healthier habit,\" Business Insider's Erin Brodwin reports. \"The practice involves inhaling heated vapor, rather than burned material. In general, vapers are believed to be exposed to fewer toxicants and cancer-causing substances than smokers.\"\n\nIn May, Walmart announced plans to raise the minimum age for tobacco purchases to 21. The company also said in May that it is in the process of discontinuing the sale of fruit- and dessert-flavored e-cigarettes.", "description": "Walmart is ending sales of vapes and related products, as Trump pushes to ban flavored e-cigarettes.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d850b8c2e22af58bb2745c3-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
