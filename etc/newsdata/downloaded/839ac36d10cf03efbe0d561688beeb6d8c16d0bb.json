The former governor considered running for president at the beginning of the 2020 campaign cycle, and grabbed national headlines when he decided against launching a bid last December.\n\nPatrick is a close ally of former President Barack Obama, and had been encouraged to run by members of Obama's inner circle. Patrick met with Obama while he was considering a presidential campaign, and he and his wife, Diane Patrick, also met with former First Lady Michelle Obama. Former Patrick aides even created a Reason to Believe PAC, which was unaffiliated with Patrick but focused on promoting his values in the 2018 midterm and ahead of 2020. That PAC closed its doors in March, seven months after it was created.\n\nIn the months following his decision to forego the race, Patrick largely stayed out of the public eye. But the former governor has ramped up his public profile in recent weeks \u2014 Patrick joined CBS News as a political contributor last month. Patrick is also the founder and co-managing partner at Bain Capital Double Impact, the impact investing fund at Bain Capital.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/91/80/ec03c70447c6993548da2d0bc702/191010-deval-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
