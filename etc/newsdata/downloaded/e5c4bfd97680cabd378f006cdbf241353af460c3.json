A snippet of the actor's plea for action was captured on Twitter, but it was his own environmental habits that have some on social media calling him a hypocrite.\n\n\"We've been talking about saving the Amazon for 30 years,\" Ford said in a video captured by Reuters, \"and we're still talking about it. The world's largest rainforest, the Amazon is crucial to any climate change solution for its capacity to sequester carbon, for its biodiversity, for its fresh water, for the air we breathe, for our morality. And it is on fire. When a room in your house is on fire, you don't say, 'There is a fire in a room in my house.' You say, 'My house is on fire,' and we only have one house.\"\n\nActor Harrison Ford, who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, is being called out for using a private plane.

They are the young people who, frankly, we have failed \u2014 who are angry, who are organized, who are capable of making a difference. They are a moral army. And the most important thing that we can do for them is to get the hell out of their way.\"\n\nWhile many on Twitter appreciated the \u201cStar Wars\u201d actor\u2019s remarks, many pointed out that he needs to look at his own carbon footprint.\n\nSince he was 52, Harrison Ford has collected and flown private aircrafts that pollute Santa Monica, CA residents. Is there a double standard? \u2014 Zo\u00eb Muntaner \u270d\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udfa1\ud83c\udf34 (@thesantamonica1) September 23, 2019\n\nOh, yeah, first we have a dim kid by sail boat telling us the earth is ending soon and now a Hollywood actor living his luxury life with a carbon footprint hundred times bigger than us, asking us to save the planet. \u2014 OnTheGround (@zeningge) September 23, 2019\n\nSo says the guy who zips around in private jets. \u2014 Jim (@Jim_the_Troll) September 23, 2019\n\nAvid flyer and fossil fuel user #harrisonford \u2014 LaurentiiMediolanensis (@TreDiMediolanum) September 23, 2019\n\nI hope he didn't forget to turn off his private jet's engine after parking it at the hangar. \u2014 K. Bella (@kweexter) September 23, 2019\n\nAnd looks like he helicoptered from his house to the jet..... \u2014 hagar (@TundraTower) September 23, 2019\n\nHarrison Ford has an aviation hobby and he owns airplanes. Ford\u2019s carbon footprint is multiples of the average person\u2019s carbon foot print around the world. What would the world look like if everyone lived Ford\u2019s lifestyle? \u2014 Jeffrey W. Ludwig (@jwludwig) September 23, 2019\n\nFord, a Conservation International board member, was also celebrated for bringing awareness to the issue. He was at the summit to announce that Conservation International will pledge $20 million to a new South American-led initiative to protect the Amazon rainforest. France has committed $100 million.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
