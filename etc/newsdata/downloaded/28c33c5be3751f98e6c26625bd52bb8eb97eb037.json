Teachers' unions \u2014 by contrast \u2014 want power.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why unions hijacked the teaching profession. That\u2019s why unions order their teachers out of the classrooms and onto the sidewalks, abandoning students to hold cities and neighborhoods hostage until the union agenda prevails.\n\nUnions employ strikes because they work. Teachers, controlled by brute force, obediently fall in line. Nervous politicians buckle when faced by cities full of angry parents whose kids have nowhere to go. Then unions get what they want \u2014 billions in tax-free dues to fund their radical leftist takeover of our schools and republic.\n\nREBECCA FRIEDRICHS: TEACHERS, YOUR UNIONS MIGHT SUPPORT TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT BUT THEY'VE ABANDONED YOU\n\nThis exact union strategy is playing out in Chicago right now. For the third time since 2012, Chicago\u2019s teachers\u2019 unions have pulled teachers from the classrooms and put them on picket lines, leaving 361,000 students and their families abandoned for days.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re asking for a 16 percent pay increase, but Chicago teacher salaries already range from $53,000.00 to over $125,000. And that\u2019s before adding in Cadillac health care and pension benefits.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThey\u2019re marching for smaller class sizes, but many Chicago classrooms are undersized.\n\nThey\u2019re also marching for hordes of new support staff to address the campus chaos created by union-supported \u201cequity\u201d policies. You see, unions promote dangerous anti-family/anti-student/anti-teacher/anti-American policies in our schools and communities. Once chaos ensues, unions place the blame on poverty, parents, school choice, and a lack of funding. Then they call for \u201csocial justice\u201d strikes to demand a fix to the problems. The fix? You guessed it! More dues-paying members and more money and power for the unions.\n\nThis is why so many families want to escape public schools. So, diabolically, unions march to demand a moratorium on charter schools to the devastation of thousands of disadvantaged families.\n\nAs a teacher who\u2019s devoted my entire life to students, I\u2019m motivated to defeat these devilish foes.\n\nUnions gained their stronghold over teachers because we were forced by law to fund them for 50 years. That\u2019s why my colleagues and I sued them to end forced unionism. Unions were livid.\n\nFor the third time since 2012, Chicago\u2019s teachers\u2019 unions have pulled teachers from the classrooms and put them on picket lines, leaving 361,000 students and their families abandoned for days.\n\nDesperate to keep their hands on our money, union lawyers threatened the U.S. Supreme Court justices that if employees were freed from forced unionism, unions would react with an \u201cuntold specter of labor unrest throughout the country,\u201d because \u201cunion security is the tradeoff for no strikes.\u201d\n\nWe won. So unions started pitching nationwide temper tantrums called \u201cRedForEd\u201d teacher protests \u2014 just like the strikes in Chicago.\n\nMy teacher colleague Dr. Joseph Ocol always crosses Chicago\u2019s picket line. You haven\u2019t likely heard of him because unions silence good teachers. Joseph\u2019s not willing to leave children unattended just because the union orders him to strike. One of his second graders was murdered while unattended \u2014 shot dead in the streets of Chicago.\n\nAfter that child\u2019s tragic death, Joseph discovered 90 percent of his students lived below the poverty line and were most vulnerable between 3 and 6 p.m. So Joseph started an after-school chess club. Shortly after, the kids started winning state and national chess tournaments and blossomed under their newfound hope.\n\nThat\u2019s why he told union leaders, \u201cI will join your strike if you will do something for the kids. I\u2019m willing to teach the kids to play chess in the picket line.\u201d\n\nBut union leaders denied his request and showed no concern for the kids. Then they hassled Joseph for teaching instead of picketing, slandered him mercilessly in national news as a \u201cscab,\u201d and ejected him from union membership while continuing to take full dues from his paychecks.\n\nRepulsively, angry union activists even tried to shut down Joseph\u2019s chess club. No wonder Chicago\u2019s kids are falling apart.\n\nThe Chicago strike, and the entire \u201cRedForEd\u201d strike movement, is a smokescreen. A deceptive power grab by unions. Their underlying motivation is to use America\u2019s schools and teachers to grow the ranks of union soldiers and haul in billions more in tax-free annual dues to push their far-reaching leftist political agenda. Unions seek to abolish parental authority, introduce more chaos and indoctrinate the next generation of Americans in radical socialist ideals. This puts our republic \u2014 and our kids \u2014 in danger.\n\nThat\u2019s the bottom line.\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to end the nightmare. Teachers must reject unions to rescue our profession and our kids, and Americans must empower teachers to do so.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs Joseph says, \u201cIn life, just like in chess, every move has a consequence.\u201d\n\nAmerica, it\u2019s our move.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REBECCA FRIEDRICHS", "description": "Teachers want to teach.
