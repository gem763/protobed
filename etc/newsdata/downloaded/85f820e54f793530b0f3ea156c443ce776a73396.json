(AP) - Seven years after hitting the road to perform and share their stories of recording with some of the biggest names in pop music, a New Jersey-based group of former A-list session musicians is being recognized for its efforts.\n\nThe Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville is giving its first \u201cRoad Warrior\u201d award to The Hit Men, a group originally assembled in 2012 by former members of Frankie Valli and Four Seasons. The group has toured steadily since then, and its Oct. 28 concert at Nashville\u2019s City Winery will close a month of shows in California, Arizona, Maine, Louisiana and Tennessee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible honor to be recognized for the work we\u2019ve each put into our careers supporting the greatest names in the music industry,\u201d founding member Lee Shapiro said.\n\nThe museum opened in 2006 and showcases the often-unsung musicians who have backed legendary pop performers. Among its famous inductees are the Wrecking Crew, the group of L.A. studio musicians that played on numerous \u201860s pop hits; and the Funk Brothers, Motown Records\u2019 house rhythm section.\n\nSeeking to ride the musical nostalgia wave and the success of the Four Seasons-inspired musical \u201cJersey Boys,\u201d The Hit Men formed in 2012 in a basement studio in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, about 10 miles from New York. Their roots extend decades further.\n\nShapiro, keyboardist for Valli during the singer\u2019s mid-1970s comeback, had played with guitarist Don Ciccone and drummer Gerry Polci with the Four Seasons and knew bassist Larry Gates from childhood. Ciccone and guitarist Jimmy Ryan had scored hits with the pop group The Critters in the \u201860s. All had extensive credits playing behind artists from Carole King and Carly Simon to Elton John, the Rolling Stones and dozens more.\n\nThe group added veteran session vocalist Russell Velasquez and has played 40 to 60 dates per year ever since, adjusting its set list as the \u201cJersey Boys\u201d phenomenon faded.\n\nAlong the way, they lost Gates to complications from multiple myeloma and Ciccone to a heart attack. Gates\u2019 spot was filled by Jeff Ganz, whose lengthy resume includes stints with Chuck Berry, Dr. John, Johnny Winter and Blood, Sweat and Tears. Polci left the group and was replaced by Steve Murphy, who has backed Alan Parsons, Todd Rundgren, Jack Bruce and others.\n\n\u201cNight after night, month after month, year after year, they are out there keeping the music alive and keeping it real, seldom getting the recognition that they all richly deserve,\u201d museum founder and CEO Joe Chambers said in a statement.\n\nThe touring is a grind for Shapiro, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2014, but it is outweighed by the rewards.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m sitting in front of the piano, I don\u2019t feel any symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m 23, 24 years old again.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Seven years after hitting the road to perform and share their stories of recording with some of the biggest names in pop music, a New Jersey-based group of former A-list session musicians is being recognized for its efforts.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Porter"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/hit_men_hall_of_fame_46522_c0-240-5760-3600_s1200x700.jpg?3b9a8ea0e82656f098dd6f7cd5420c99f93f2f69", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
