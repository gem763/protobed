Yes. Speaker Pelosi does it every day,\u201d Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said as she retweeted the picture.\n\n\u201cThanks for the new cover photo @realDonaldTrump!,\u201d tweeted Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill.\n\nOthers pointed out that several members of Trump\u2019s cabinet looked as if they would rather be somewhere else.\n\n\u201cThe men on your right reflect the embarrassment we all feel,\u201d tweeted actress Mia Farrow.\n\nPelosi has previously gone viral with her apparent trolling of Trump, with her slow clapping of his last State of the Union speech becoming an instant meme.\n\nAfter leaving the White House meeting, she told the press she prayed for the president and his family \u201call the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we have to pray for his health, because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president,\u201d she said.\n\nHours later, Trump suggested Pelosi had mental problems of her own.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her \u2018upstairs,\u2019 or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nOne of the Democrats who attended the meeting, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, said Trump launched into a \u201cnasty diatribe\u201d against them, while Pelosi said the president experienced a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham rejected the Democratic version of events, saying the president had been \u201cmeasured and decisive,\u201d and that Pelosi walking out was \u201cbaffling but not surprising.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was the first face-to-face encounter between Trump and Pelosi since her explosive September 24 statement announcing a formal impeachment inquiry.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi following an acrimonious White House meeting appears", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/dc8998_house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-leads-senate-minority-leader-chuck-schumer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
