Coming back from France the last time was definitely hard. It took forever and the current pushed me all over.\n\n\"I got stung in the face by a jellyfish and it wasn't as cold as I thought it might be but it was still chilly.\"\n\nOnly four swimmers had previously crossed the Channel three times without stopping. Before Ms Thomas no-one had ever completed a fourth leg.\n\nHer mother, Becky Baxter, told BBC Radio 4: \"I've been on a lot of her trips. This was by far the scariest.\"\n\nShe said her daughter was a \"freak of nature\" but did have \"a lot of trouble with stomach ache\" on this trip.\n\n\"We were a little worried at the end of the first day as she was not able to hold anything down,\" she said.\n\nFor nutrition, she relied on a protein recovery drink mixed with electrolytes and a little bit of caffeine to help offset sleepiness.\n\n\"It is tied to a rope and we get her attention every 30 minutes and throw it to her,\" Ms Baxter said.\n\nImage caption Ms Thomas was swimming non-stop for 54 hours and 10 minutes\n\nLast year Ms Thomas had treatment for breast cancer and her support team said she \"used the swimming as her means of coping with the treatment\".\n\nOfficial observer Kevin Murphy said: \"It is a triumph, she has tested the limits of endurance.\n\n\"It is amazing, absolutely inspirational. At the end we were very emotional.\"\n\nMs Thomas celebrated entering the record books, and making dry land at Dover, with champagne and chocolates.\n\nShe completed her first open-water event in 2007 and first swam across the Channel in 2012 and then again in 2016.\n\nMs Thomas said it was worth the physical exertion: \"I almost didn't go back when I got back to England.\n\n\"I thought I should just finish and quit, but my team said, 'Guess what? You can do better. You can keep going'.\"", "description": "Sarah Thomas, a 37-year-old cancer survivor, began the marathon swim on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nk0cb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
