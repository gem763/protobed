The EPP is, after all, much more ideologically homogeneous, and it remains the Continent\u2019s preeminent political alliance.\n\nYet the party \u2014 the political home of German Chancellors Angela Merkel and Helmut Kohl, of current and future Commission Presidents Jean-Claude Juncker and Ursula von der Leyen \u2014 is in the grip of something of an identity crisis. Its fortunes have declined in recent years, and its grip on power in the EU has slipped as the Continent\u2019s political landscape has become more complex and diverse.\n\nIf, as expected, Tusk replaces Joseph Daul \u2014 a powerful but nearly invisible former French MEP and consummate backroom player who shuns attention and is something of a relic in the era of Twitter and Instagram \u2014 he will be charged with breathing new life into a respected but struggling political brand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything that goes against Tusk\u2019s candidacy\" \u2014 A senior EPP insider\n\nThe party\u2019s first-place finish in May\u2019s European Parliament election was less a cause for celebration than for introspective consternation, as it was accompanied by the loss of 35 seats.\n\nThere were times during the campaign when its formidable, unrivaled war machine seemed to lack leadership and direction. The EPP, long the \u201cpopular\u201d party, struggled for public appeal as it faced challenges on multiple fronts: its traditional center-left opponents, liberals boosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, surging Greens and far-right nationalists.\n\nThe conservatives are now scrambling to show they are as concerned about climate change as the Greens, and as eager as the liberals for rejuvenation and reform of the EU, including a revamp of the failed lead candidate or Spitzenkandidat process for choosing the European Commission president.\n\nIt is both to Tusk\u2019s personal advantage and the party\u2019s great disadvantage that he has no serious challenger in sight ahead of a party congress in Zagreb next month that will choose Daul\u2019s successor. The party\u2019s ranks have been depleted not just in the European Parliament but also among national leaders.\n\nAmong the Western European powers that founded that EU, only Germany has a leader from the EPP: Merkel, who is in the twilight of her career. Meanwhile, the young Austrian, Sebastian Kurz, is still working to get back into government after a coalition collapse, which leaves Ireland, Greece, Croatia and Latvia with the most prominent non-German conservatives in national capitals.\n\nTusk himself is still eyeing a possible campaign for president of Poland next year. But the strength of the ruling nationalists in his home country suggests that could be an uphill struggle.\n\nSo for now, at least, Tusk has eagerly accepted the EPP nomination, and the party seems equally keen to have a president whose name and face are recognized across Europe, often for his provocative statements in opposition to Brexit. Another candidate could still emerge before nominations close on November 13 but there\u2019s no sign of one so far.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything that goes against Tusk\u2019s candidacy,\u201d one senior EPP insider said. \u201cI think everybody would be happy.\u201d\n\nUnpopular with populists\n\nAs a former anti-communist activist and the longest-serving prime minister of Poland, Tusk is likely to differentiate himself from Daul, a cattle farmer who often acted as a background operator close to both the centrist Merkel and her nationalist nemesis within the party, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nDaul was often accused of being too soft on populists within the EPP, particularly Orb\u00e1n. Tusk, by contrast, is the sworn enemy of Poland\u2019s populist governing Law and Justice party, and is expected to be far tougher.\n\nTusk is also expected to cement the EPP\u2019s Christian Democrat roots, while also serving as a symbol of how European conservatism has shifted markedly to the east in recent years.\n\n\u201cHe is not going to be a German worshipper,\u201d the EPP insider said.\n\nIf the Kohl era marked Germany\u2019s emergence as the unrivaled economic and political leader in the EU, the Tusk era could well mark the solidification of the EU's expansion into the former communist bloc. It\u2019s a period of transition, marked by pervasive tensions between East and West, and some say the EPP\u2019s ability to reconcile the two sides will be the key signal of whether the EU as a whole can hold together.\n\n\u201cI would like to believe that all of us here wish to remain faithful to the ideals of the true Christian Democracy\" \u2014 Donald Tusk, European Council president\n\nFor the first time in the EPP group\u2019s history, Eastern European MEPs now outnumber their Spanish and French colleagues, giving parties like Tusk\u2019s Civic Platform and Romania\u2019s National Liberal Party power and influence that they rarely enjoyed before.\n\nLast year, Tusk made clear at an EPP congress in Helsinki that \u201cIf you want to replace the Western model of liberal democracy with an Eastern model of \u2018authoritarian democracy,\u2019 you are not a Christian Democrat.\"\n\n\u201cI would like to believe that all of us here wish to remain faithful to the ideals of the true Christian Democracy,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, Christian Democracy seems to be a declining political force, with Christianity far less in fashion in Western countries, and democracy being tested in eastern countries like Hungary and Poland.\n\nThe question for Tusk is whether Europe has already passed peak EPP.\n\nThe alliance has 84 member parties across Europe and nine European leaders including Merkel, Orb\u00e1n and recent addition Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Greece. Its group is the largest in the European Parliament. Since the \u201990s, the EPP has provided the vast majority of European Commission presidents.\n\nHowever, in the European election in May, member parties of the EPP lost ground in almost every major European country. In the European Parliament, the EPP faction fell to 182 members from 217. Though three candidates are still to be nominated for the new von der Leyen Commission, the EPP looks set to hold only about half the 14 commissioner posts it held at the start of Juncker\u2019s term in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of a hegemony,\u201d said Esteban Gonz\u00e1les Pons, a Spanish MEP who is a vice chair of the EPP group in the European Parliament. \u201cThe EPP still is the biggest party in Europe, and still is the party that better represents the feeling and the thinking of Europeans.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cit\u2019s clear that the world has changed and the EPP has to change as well,\u201d Gonz\u00e1les Pons added. \u201cWe are an old party with old principles and values, and we have to adapt our party to the present and the future.\u201d He added that the party needs to answer \u201cideological contradictions,\u201d including its relationship with the far right.\n\n\u201cWe have to decide if we are going to work with extreme-right parties or to turn our back on them,\u201d he said, citing EPP parties in countries like Austria, which decided to govern with the far right.\n\nAnother pressing question regards Orb\u00e1n. The Hungarian leader\u2019s Fidesz party was suspended from the EPP in March on the basis that it was not sticking to the EPP\u2019s values. But its MEPs remain part of the EPP group in the European Parliament.\n\nSome officials are pressing for a definitive decision of whether Fidesz belongs in the fold by the time the EPP holds its Zagreb congress, where Tusk will likely be anointed as president.\n\nNew green dream?\n\nOn climate policy, some EPP leaders have been urging the party to get greener, quickly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s starting to happen is that green doesn\u2019t mean left, green can also be right,\u201d Latvian Prime Minister Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161 told POLITICO's EU Confidential podcast in a recent interview. He suggested the EPP should embrace climate-friendly policies, as they were a way to both do the right thing for the planet and for businesses to make money.\n\nKari\u0146\u0161 had a warning for the EPP. \u201cThings that don\u2019t evolve tend to be things that are dead,\u201d he said. \u201cLanguages that don\u2019t change are dead languages. Parties that don\u2019t evolve are in the history books.\u201d\n\nAt the Zagreb congress, the EPP will discuss how to lead the revamp of the Spitzenkandidat process, including perhaps a mechanism to encourage sitting prime ministers to run for Commission president \u2014 something national leaders historically have been reluctant to do.\n\nMany in the EPP are still bitter about the way national leaders on the European Council cast aside Manfred Weber, the EPP\u2019s lead candidate, and instead appointed von der Leyen, also an EPP member, to the EU\u2019s top executive post. There is concern within the EPP that the new Commission president might choose to keep her own party at a distance, given the need for a broader coalition in the European Parliament to move legislation.\n\nEPP officials said they are confident that von der Leyen ultimately would recognize that she needs allies in her own political family, and that they are the only ones she can trust to put her agenda into action.\n\nTusk is well positioned to be one of those allies, as an already well-known figure in Brussels \u2014 unlike von der Leyen.\n\nHe has often sought to convince others by recalling his own powerful personal narrative, as a Polish citizen whose country fought for EU membership.\n\n\u201cI remember the first time when I started to dream about a European future for my country, I think I was maybe a 30- or 35-year-old guy then,\u201d Tusk told reporters last week. \u201cAnd I had to wait more than twenty-five years for this.\u201d\n\nTusk made those remarks after failing to persuade Macron to stop blocking the start of EU membership talks for the Balkan countries of Albania and North Macedonia.\n\nHe\u2019ll be hoping for more luck getting his own party on side in his next presidential role.\n\nDavid M.
