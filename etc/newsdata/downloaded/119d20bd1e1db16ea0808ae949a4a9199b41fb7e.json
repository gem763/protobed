That\u2019s an awkward position just ask Martin Odegaard, who had to go out on loan to get his career back on track, found out.\n\nBut after coming on at minute 71 he took just two minutes to make his debut as memorable as Ansu Fati has been making his first steps at Barcelona.\n\nVinicius breaks down in tears after breaking the deadlock for Real Madrid on Wednesday night\n\nNacho hugs the forward after he scored a sensational goal for Zinedine Zidane's side\n\nBrazilian forward Rodrygo added a second for Los Blancos in their home tie win over Osasuna\n\nMATCH FACTS Real Madrid XI: Areola, Odriozola, Militao, Ramos, Nacho, Casemiro, Kroos, Valverde, Vazquez, Vinicius, Jovic. Subs: Courtois, Carvajal, Varane, Hazard, Benzema, James, Rodrygo Osasuna XI: Ruben, Estupinan, Ra\u00fal Navas, Roncaglia, Cardona, Fran Merida, Brandon, Ruben Garcia, Lillo, Ibanez, Moncayola. Subs: S.Herrera, Nacho Vidal, Chimy Avilla, R.Torres, Juan Villar, Adriane, Luis Perea\n\nHe took a long crossfield pass into his stride in the inside left channel and bent an unstoppable shot past Ruben Martinez.\n\nThe future looks bright and very Brazilian for Real Madrid because the player Rodrygo replaced in the second half, Vinicius, also scored a spectacular strike in the win over Osasuna.\n\nVinicius, one year older than Rodrygo, was in tears when his curling first half effort from Toni Kroos\u2019 pass hit the back of the net.\n\nHe has been teased for some poor finishing but this was special and capped an excellent first half performance from the winger.\n\nBoth Vinicius and Rodrygo fully justified coach Zinedine Zidane\u2019s decision to rest most of his first choice players ahead of Saturday\u2019s Madrid derby.\n\nWith Marcelo and Ferland Mendy injured Nacho had to fill in at left-back for Madrid with Sergio Ramos partnering Militao so Raphael Varane could rest.\n\nDani Carvajal also took the night off and his replacement Alvaro Odriozola produced a brilliant run in the first half that almost broke the deadlock before Vinicius\u2019 goal.\n\nFede Valverde joined Casemiro and Kroos in midfield as Luka Modric missed another match injured.\n\nRodrygo comes off the bench to add a second for Zidane's side in the second half of the match\n\nUp front Gareth Bale, Eden Hazard and Karim Benzema all rested while Vinicius started alongside Lucas and Luca Jovic.\n\nThe latter two combined in the second half and Jovic scored what looked like his first goal for Real Madrid but VAR spoilt the fun with one of those offside calls in the which the player penalized has 99 per cent of his body level with the last defender.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter as Rodrygo doubled Madrid\u2019s lead. Alphonse Areola, who was also making his debut as Zidane rested Thibaut Courtois, kept a clean sheet.\n\nThe French coach had shuffled his pack with one eye on the derby but still come up all aces.\n\nMadrid now go into Saturday\u2019s capital showdown top of La Liga and with their first team players nicely rested. They will also face an Atletico side without Alvaro Morata who saw red in their win over Mallorca.\n\nIt was a great night for Real Madrid \u2013 just seven days on from what seemed like the end of the team and the coach\u2019s world at the Parc des Prinices.", "description": "PETE JENSON IN SPAIN: Rodrygo Goes made a sensational start to life at Real Madrid with a goal with practically his first touch after coming on as a second half substitute.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/21/18935644-0-image-a-12_1569444673474.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
