Yet the effort to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller led Giuliani to Ukraine, which now entangles the former federal prosecutor and mayor in legal jeopardy and is central to the danger threatening the presidency he labored to protect.\n\nThe New York Times reported Friday, citing a pair of anonymous sources familiar with the matter, that the investigation is linked to Giuliani's efforts to undermine Marie Yovanovitch, formerly the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has declined to comment on the Times report.\n\nTwo Florida businessmen with ties to Giuliani were charged Thursday with federal campaign finance violations. Both played key roles in Giuliani's efforts to get Ukraine to launch a corruption investigation into Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a gas company there.\n\n___\n\nTrump says he's an 'island of one' on Syria\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump said Saturday that he is an \"island of one\" for removing U.S. forces from northeastern Syria.\n\nBut he remained steadfast and defended a move that drew widespread bipartisan criticism that he has endangered stability in the Middle East and risked the lives of Syrian Kurdish allies who helped the U.S. bring down the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nTurkey, however, regards those Kurdish fighters as a terrorist threat and has launched a military operation against them.\n\nTrump said the U.S. cannot fight \"endless wars.\"\n\n\"We have to bring our great heroes, our great soldiers, we have to bring them home. It's time. It's time,\" Trump said in a lengthy and wide-ranging address to the Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of social conservative activists.\n\n___\n\nHotel collapse in New Orleans leaves 1 dead, 2 missing\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - A large section of a Hard Rock Hotel under construction beside New Orleans' historic French Quarter collapsed Saturday amid blinding dust and flying debris, killing one person and injuring more than 20. Rescue workers searched the largely unstable building for two people still unaccounted for.\n\nNearby buildings were evacuated. A 270-foot (82-meter) construction crane - one of two still looming over the multistory building - also was dangerously unstable, fire officials said. The hunt for the missing was suspended at nightfall over safety concerns. A statement from the project contractor said its representatives would work \"throughout the night\" with emergency officials on a plan to stabilize the building.\n\n\"I heard a huge noise and thought it was a plane crashing,\" said Sue Hurley, a 68-year-old guest at a hostel across the street that shuddered with the force of the collapse. Hurley said she was reminded of news accounts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nWWL-TV aired and tweeted a viewer's dramatic video of upper floors falling on top of each other before one side of the building crashed to the street.\n\nAnother video on social media showed what looked like a metal structure - part of the building or a piece of construction equipment - tumbling to the ground and people running from the scene as clouds of dust billowed up, obscuring the view like a thick fog.\n\n___\n\nLouisiana's Democratic governor forced into runoff\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards' quest for a second term as the Deep South's only Democratic governor will stretch over another month, as voters in his crimson state denied him a primary win Saturday and sent him to a runoff election.\n\nThe Democratic incumbent was unable to top 50% of the vote in the six-candidate field, raising questions about his reelection chances against a national Republican offensive that includes President Donald Trump. Trump made a last-minute appeal to Louisiana's voters to reject Edwards.\n\nEdwards will compete in the Nov. 16 runoff against businessman Eddie Rispone, a Baton Rouge businessman and longtime GOP political donor making his first bid for public office. Rispone largely self-financed his campaign, reaching the second-place spot after outspending fellow Republican contender U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham 5-to-1.\n\nFive Republican statewide elected officials on the ballot won reelection to new four-year terms: Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, Attorney General Jeff Landry, Treasurer John Schroder, Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain and Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon. Republican Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin was forced into a runoff.\n\nTrump praised the outcome of Saturday's election and took credit for keeping Edwards from a primary victory, saying in a tweet: \"The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN, @EddieRispone. Thank you Louisiana!\" He said Edwards' support fell \"after I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.\"\n\n___\n\nJapan launches major rescue after 'immense' typhoon floods\n\nTOKYO (AP) - Helicopters plucked people from their flooded homes on Sunday as rescue efforts went into full force in wide areas of Japan after a powerful typhoon unleashed heavy rainfall on Tokyo and surrounding areas, leaving at least seven dead and 15 missing.\n\nPublic broadcaster NHK gave a higher toll than the government of 10 dead and 16 missing plus 128 injured as more details were coming in the from field, a day after Typhoon Hagibis made landfall south of Tokyo and moved northward.\n\n\"The major typhoon has caused immense damage far and wide in eastern Japan,\" government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters, adding that 27,000 military troops and other rescue crews were deployed for the operation.\n\nNews footage showed a rescue helicopter hovering in a flooded area in Nagano prefecture where an embankment of the Chikuma River broke, and streams of water were continuing to spread over residential areas. The chopper plucked those stranded on the second floor of a home submerged in muddy waters.\n\nAerial footage showed tractors at work trying to control the flooding. Meanwhile, rows of Japan's prized bullet trains, parked in a facility, were sitting in a pool of water.\n\n___\n\nTurkish forces say they've captured key Syrian border town\n\nCEYLANPINAR, Turkey (AP) - Turkey's military said it captured a key Syrian border town under heavy bombardment Saturday in its most significant gain since an offensive against Kurdish fighters began four days ago, with no sign of relenting despite mounting international criticism.\n\nTurkish troops entered central Ras al-Ayn, according to Turkey's Defense Ministry and a war monitor group. The ministry tweeted: \"Ras al-Ayn's residential center has been taken under control through the successful operations in the east of Euphrates\" River. It marked the biggest gain made by Turkey since the invasion began Wednesday.\n\nThe continued push by Turkey into Syria comes days after President Donald Trump pulled U.S. forces out of the area, making Turkey's air and ground offensive possible, and said he wanted to stop getting involved with \"endless wars.\" Trump's decision drew swift bipartisan criticism that he was endangering regional stability and risking the lives of Syrian Kurdish allies who brought down the Islamic State group in Syria. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces was the main U.S. ally in the fight and lost 11,000 fighters in the nearly five-year battle against IS.\n\nTurkish troops and allied Syrian opposition fighters have made gains recently capturing several northern villages in fighting and bombardment that left dozens of people killed or wounded. The invasion also has forced nearly 100,000 people to flee their homes amid concerns that IS might take advantage of the chaos and try to rise again after its defeat in Syria earlier this year.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, said the United States should carry out its \"moral responsibilities\" and close northern Syrian airspace to Turkish warplanes, but that it didn't want the U.S. to send its soldiers \"to the front lines and put their lives in danger.\"\n\n___\n\nFlorida timber farmers face tough choices year after Michael\n\nBLOUNTSTOWN, Fla. (AP) - The sunsets are a sight to behold in Joe Leonard's neck of the woods these days. A year ago, lush stands of towering pines obscured the horizon, he said as he drove his pickup along a dusty Florida Panhandle road. Now, fields of thick grass mask row after row of stumps decaying into the soil that has sustained his family for five generations.\n\nUp the road, heaps of rotting logs lay bare the scars that Hurricane Michael left last October when it ploughed through the region.\n\n\"It's hard to describe how sick I felt when I came out here,\" Leonard said as he surveyed a stand of snapped 30-year-old slash pine, their trunks big enough for a full bear hug.\n\nThe massive storm crashed ashore as a Category 5 hurricane with winds exceeding 160 mph (255 kph), the strongest ever recorded to hit Florida's northern Gulf Coast. The storm killed more than two dozen people in the region, destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of homes and wrought catastrophic damage on the region's timber industry.\n\nIt's been an excruciating year for the Leonards and other Panhandle families who make their living off the land. A year after Michael, they face wrenching decisions about how to carry on.\n\n___\n\nAuthorities: 3 deaths tied to Southern California wildfires\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Three people have died at the scene of Southern California wildfires this week, authorities said Saturday, as firefighters aided by diminishing winds beat back a blaze on the edge of Los Angeles that damaged or destroyed more than 30 structures and sent a blanket of smoke across a swath of neighborhoods.\n\nLos Angeles officials said the fire in the city's San Fernando Valley area hadn't grown significantly since Friday, and ground crews were tamping down lingering hotspots. Evacuation orders were lifted in all of Los Angeles County and in parts of Riverside County, where a second blaze was burning.\n\nShortly before 5 p.m., the Los Angeles Police Department said in a tweet: \"We thank members of the community for promptly heeding the evacuation orders and their patience as we worked to contain the fire.\"\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told residents to be cautious returning home to neighborhoods where fire crews could still be operating.\n\nIn Los Angeles, one man who tried to fight the blaze died of a heart attack, and one firefighter reported a minor eye injury.\n\n___\n\nAndrew Johnson back in spotlight for 1868 impeachment brush\n\nThe president traveled the country, fanning racial animus. He viewed the Congress with disdain. He also tried to undo some of the most important achievements of his predecessor, using executive power.\n\nThat was not Donald Trump, but another president who faced the ignominy of impeachment: Andrew Johnson.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry of Trump unfolds, Johnson, never among America's most famous presidents, though widely considered one of the worst, is attracting renewed attention.\n\nJohnson was the first president to be impeached, by the House of Representatives in 1868. He escaped removal from office by a single vote short of the required two-thirds after his trial in the Senate, but was so disgraced he was denied his party's nomination that year.\n\nTrump and Johnson came from opposite ends of America's social spectrum - Johnson from deep poverty, Trump from great wealth. Yet they shared bellicose personalities, a disdain for political niceties, and a penchant for divisive, sometimes racist rhetoric.\n\n___\n\nTorres, Tanaka lead Yankees over Astros 7-0 in ALCS opener\n\nHOUSTON (AP) - Gleyber Torres kept up his October surge with a homer and five RBIs, Masahiro Tanaka polished his playoff resume and the New York Yankees blanked the Houston Astros 7-0 Saturday night in the AL Championship Series opener.\n\nWith so much attention focused on the Astros aces, Tanaka showed he more than belonged on this stage, too. He threw one-hit ball for six innings to outpitch Zack Greinke, improving to 5-2 with a 1.32 ERA in the postseason.\n\nTorres did his part in this matchup of 100-win behemoths with a go-ahead double, a solo homer, a two-run single and an RBI grounder. Moved up to third in the batting order after mashing in a sweep of Minnesota, the 22-year-old star became the youngest AL player to drive in five runs during a postseason game.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton and Gio Urshela also homered and right fielder Aaron Judge turned in the key play, catching a line drive and doubling Alex Bregman off first base when it was still 1-0.\n\nThe Yankees will try to build on their early momentum when James Paxton starts against 21-game winner Justin Verlander in Game 2 on Sunday night.", "description": "Trump backs Giuliani, but some aides wish he would cut tiesWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Saturday stood behind personal attorney Rudy Giuliani,...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
