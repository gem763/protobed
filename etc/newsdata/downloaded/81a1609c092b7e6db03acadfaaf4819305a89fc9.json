In the end you have to stick together and know how to defend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy I could do something for the team (setting up Suarez) and take three points back to Barcelona.\u201d\n\nThe Catalans were without captain Lionel Messi and teenager Ansu Fati as well as winger Ousmane Dembele who suffered a thigh injury before the game.\n\nGetafe attacked boldly from the start, looking to test the nerve of the Spanish champions, while Carles Perez and Suarez came close at the other end.\n\nTer Stegen made a fine save to keep out Angel Rodriguez as the hosts threatened at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez.\n\nBarcelona\u2019s German goalkeeper then played a crucial role in the opener, charging out of his area to regain possession before lofting a fine pass over the top of the defence for Suarez.\n\nThe Uruguayan coolly lobbed Getafe goalkeeper David Soria to send Barcelona ahead in the 41st minute.\n\nFirpo doubled the lead four minutes after halftime, tucking home from close range after Perez\u2019s effort was only parried by Soria.\n\nLenglet was sent off in the final stages for a late challenge which earned him a second yellow card, while Angel missed a late chance, allowing Barcelona to keep their first clean sheet in La Liga this season.", "description": "Barcelona ended a string of bad results away from home with a 2-0 win at Getafe on Saturday in La Liga.", "authors": ["Rik Sharma", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434928223&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0KV", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
