That set him up with a fight with Jorge Masvidal at UFC 239 that could have very well been a title eliminator for him.\n\nBut he was on the receiving end of a record-breaking first round knockout loss at the hands of Masvidal in just five seconds, which put a halt to any near-term title aspirations.\n\nFor the outspoken and witty Askren, he knows the consequences of losing at this point in his career. Having come out of retirement for his UFC tenure, the 35-year-old former Bellator and ONE Championship welterweight titleholder said a loss to Maia would set him back majorly, and he might have to contemplate retirement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have to think about it,\u201d Askren said. \u201cBut man, if I don\u2019t win this fight, I\u2019m knocked way, way, way down the rung. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019m gonna go in there and mix it up, and then after that we\u2019ll have to see where it goes.\u201d\n\nIn Maia (27-9 MMA, 21-9 UFC) two-time state champion wrestler Askren gets an interesting stylistic matchup against a jiu-jitsu ace and ADCC champion.\n\nBut it\u2019s a familiar challenge for Askren. He was the one helping then 170-pound champ Tyron Woodley prepare for his fight against Maia in 2017. Woodley defended his title and stuffed all of Maia\u2019s takedown attempts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, because I\u2019ve been watching Demian for years,\u201d Askren said. \u201cI scouted him when Tyron fought him. I actually tried to emulate his style for Tyron to make it as believable as possible. Tyron stopped 27 takedowns, so I think I very adequately emulated Demian\u2019s style for that fight. But yeah, he\u2019s someone I respect a lot.\u201d\n\nMaia\u2019s most recent losses have come at the hands of Woodley, Colby Covington and current welterweight champ Kamaru Usman. All three of them have one thing in common: a strong wrestling background, which Askren also has.\n\n\u201cHis only three losses at 170 are Colby, \u2018Marty\u2019 (Usman) and Tyron,\u201d Askren said. \u201cThose are all three pretty solid wrestlers. So he does struggle against the best level wrestler. Against other people, he\u2019s really able to impose his will. And so obviously when you look at that recipe, I think that\u2019s something that favors me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m preparing for a lot of positions that I think we\u2019ll see in the fight. I\u2019m not gonna just dive in for takedowns, but I probably will get my takedowns. I will secure top position. I think I\u2019m a very dominant top position, and I\u2019ll be able to stuff all of his sweeps and land a lot of damage from top.\u201d\n\nAskren knows a win over Maia won\u2019t set him up for a title shot, but thinks it would strengthen his position in the rankings. Not afraid to call his shots, he sees a big fight on the horizon should he emerge victorious next week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get a title shot,\u201d Askren said. \u201cDemian Maia, although he\u2019s ranked 10th (in the UFC), is one of the best guys in the division. He essentially fought Tyron in the title fight and then he kind of propelled both \u2018Marty\u2019 (Usman) and Colby to title fights. If it wasn\u2019t directly before, it was very near that title fight realm. So here\u2019s what I think it does: I think a win over Demian Maia puts me back up into the upper echelon of the welterweights. I think then I can call out someone else who\u2019s very highly ranked. And then a win there puts me in that realm where I could be getting a title shot.\u201d", "description": "There's a lot on the line for Ben Askren as heads into his UFC Singapore main event vs. Demian Maia.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jorge-masvidal-ben-askren-ufc-239-12.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
