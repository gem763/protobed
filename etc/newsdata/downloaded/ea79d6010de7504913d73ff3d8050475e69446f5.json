The 34-year-old NBA veteran has a lifetime Nike contract said to be worth $1 billion over its term, as well as endorsement deals with Walmart and Coca-Cola, an ownership stake in 19 Blaze Pizza franchises and his own production firm, SpringHill Entertainment.\n\nThe four-time MVP\u2019s business dealings in China became a subject of debate earlier this month after James criticized Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey for failing to consider the financial ramifications of a tweet in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Chinese sponsors suspended ties with the NBA after the tweet, and the league\u2019s games have yet to return to air on state-owned television.\n\n\u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually,\u201d James told reporters earlier this month. \u201cSo just be careful what we tweet and we say and what we do even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\nJames topped Forbes\u2019 annual rankings for the sixth consecutive year.\n\nGolden State Warriors star Stephen Curry ranked second with $85.2 million in earnings over the last year, including $40.2 million in salary and $45 million in endorsements. His portfolio includes a lucrative endorsement deal with sportswear brand Under Armour, which releases a signature Curry sneaker.\n\nBrooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant ranked third with $73.2 million in total earnings, including $38.2 million in salary and $35 million from endorsements. Durant is slated to miss the entire 2019-20 season while recovering from surgery on a torn Achilles tendon but still earned a max contract from the Nets in free agency during the offseason.\n\nHouston Rockets guard Russell Westbrook ($56.5 million) and teammate James Harden ($55.2 million) rounded out the top five. Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA\u2019s reigning MVP, finished ninth with earnings of $45.8 million.\n\nForbes\u2019 full list of the NBA\u2019s highest-paid players can be viewed here.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The four-time MVP\u2019s business dealings in China became a subject of debate earlier this month after James criticized Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/LeBron-James-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
