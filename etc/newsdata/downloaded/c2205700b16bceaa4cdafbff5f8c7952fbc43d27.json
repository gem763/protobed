But talks were not expected to continue Sunday evening. It would be the first national UAW strike since 2007.\n\nThe collective bargaining agreement expired Saturday at midnight. Despite ongoing talks since July, when the union met with GM leadership to renew an arrangement in place since 2015, the parties remain divided on several key issues. The UAW said it is aiming to secure fair wages, affordable health care and better job security, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe stood up for General Motors when they needed us most,\u201d said UAW Vice President Terry Dittes in a statement Sunday. \u201cNow we are standing together in unity and solidarity for our Members, their families and the communities where we work and live.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnited Auto Workers Vice President Terry Dittes in Detroit announces a nationwide strike against General Motors. (Rebecca Cook/Reuters)\n\nIn a statement, GM said it offered to create more than 5,400 jobs, add over $7 billion in investments and implement improved plans for profit-sharing and health benefits.\n\n\u201cWe presented a strong offer that improves wages, benefits and grows U.S. jobs in substantive ways and it is disappointing that the UAW leadership has chosen to strike at midnight tonight,\u201d the news release Sunday read. \u201cWe have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency. Our goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business.\u201d\n\nThe strike was greenlit Sunday in Detroit during a UAW meeting of nearly 200 regional leaders gathered from at least seven states. The group voted unanimously in favor of the plan, union spokesman Brian Rothenberg told The Washington Post.\n\nFor every auto assembler, there are several manufacturing and supply workers outside GM that could be adversely affected if the plants shut down, Rothenberg said Sunday. \u201cBut this is a sacrifice worth making. It\u2019s not just standing up for ourselves. It\u2019s standing up for all of us.\u201d\n\nIf the strike commences, more than a thousand Teamsters will refuse to transport GM vehicles to dealerships in a move of solidarity with UAW, said Bret Caldwell, a spokesman for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n\n\u201cOur members won\u2019t cross the picket line,\u201d Caldwell said Sunday. \u201cThey stood with us when we have fought employers. This is another way we can stand with them.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFrom helicopter repairman to leader of the Internet\u2019s \u2018darkest reaches\u2019: The life and times of 8chan owner Jim Watkins\n\nN.Y. attorney general exposes $1 billion in wire transfers by Sackler family\n\nTop Democrat attempts to block Trump from paying farm bailout money, setting up battle over trade war tactics", "description": "The United Auto Workers strike is set to begin at midnight, unless a deal can be reached at the negotiation table.", "authors": ["Deanna Paul", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "September At Pm", "Deanna Paul Covers National", "Breaking News For The Washington Post.
