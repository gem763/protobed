Fundamentally, our agreements must be aimed at solving problems.\"\n\nMore protests in Quito\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of black-clad riot police drove protesters out of north-central Quito's Arbolito Park, the epicentre of the protests, and into surrounding streets.\n\nOn Saturday, the government loosened a 24-hour curfew, allowing people to move freely around the capital between 11 am and 8 pm local time [ Henry Romero/Reuters]\n\nThe park had filled on Friday with mostly peaceful protesters chanting against the government.\n\nBut by Sunday afternoon the air was white with smoke from burning tires and tear gas after more than 24 hours of clashes between police and hardcore protesters armed with sharpened sticks and shields improvised out of satellite dishes or plywood.\n\nAdjoining streets were piled high with burned tyres, tree branches and paving stones.\n\nVolunteer medics from the fire department and medical schools waved white sheets on poles as they led protesters to safety.\n\nYoung men from Ecuador's indigenous minority and the mixed race, or mestizo, majority, milled about on streets under the watch of police and a few dozen soldiers.\n\n\"I'm here to support the people,\" said Juan Taipe, an indigenous construction worker armed with a waist-high stick.\n\n\"The government measures are really bad for poor people like me. The government wants something that we are rejecting.\"\n\nThe public ombudsman's office said on Sunday that seven people had died in the protests, 1,340 had been hurt and 1,152 arrested.\n\nThe government loosened a 24-hour curfew imposed on Saturday, allowing people to move freely around the capital between 11 am and 8 pm local time.\n\nThe protests have drawn thousands of Ecuadorians from outside the indigenous minority and many said they would continue demonstrating despite the negotiations.\n\nDebt, inflation\n\nEcuador, a former OPEC member, was left deeply in debt by a decade of high spending by the previous government of former president Rafael Correa, and the international decline in oil prices.\n\nMoreno is raising taxes, liberalising labour laws and cutting public spending in order to get more than US$4bn in emergency financing from the IMF.\n\nAs part of that plan, Moreno's elimination of subsidies is driving the most popular variety of petrol from $1.85 to $2.39 a gallon and diesel from $1.03 to $2.30.\n\nPanic and speculation sent prices soaring, with costs of some products more than doubling.\n\nIn the country's Amazon oil fields, protests at installations, described by some government officials as attacks, have halted or slowed production.\n\nEcuador had been producing 430,000 barrels of oil a day, but that had dropped to 176,029 barrels by Sunday, said an official at state oil producer Petroamazonas, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to release the information.\n\nThe drop in output has led to a loss of about $14m a day, the official said.", "description": "Indigenous groups demand immediate cancellation of president's order ending fuel subsidies during UN-mediated meeting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/2f1fd6cb45d24129be62f0ffa77957e2_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
