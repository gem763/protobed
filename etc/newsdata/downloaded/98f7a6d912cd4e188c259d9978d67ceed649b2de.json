The shortcomings were \u201csystemic\u201d and \u201cboth personnel and systems were overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster\u201d, but Michael Dowden, watch manager at North Kensington fire station, was among the junior staff criticised directly. He was first in charge on the scene and remained so until 1.50am and should have realised the fire had penetrated the building, and that compartmentation, which underpins the \u201cstay put\u201d advice had been breached. Dowden should have decided to evacuate the building, flooding the building with firefighters, knocking on doors to get people out, Moore-Bick said.\n\n\u201cFewer people would have died if the order to evacuate had been given by 02.00,\u201d said Moore-Bick.\n\nThere were \u201cserious deficiencies in command and control,\u201d he said. Senior officers arriving later failed to give sufficient practical support or inform themselves quickly enough of conditions and operations within the building and \u201cthe best part of an hour was lost\u201d.\n\n999 calls\n\nOperators in the LFB control room in Stratford, east London, sometimes refused to believe desperate victims about smoke and fire as they were \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by an unprecedented volume of emergency calls from Grenfell residents.\n\nOperators \u201ctoo often treated what callers were telling them with scepticism, in some cases contradicting the caller.\u201d Often they \u201cinsisted the fire was on floor four, contrary to what they were being told by the caller. They appear to have been unable to grasp the fact that it had spread rapidly up the building.\u201d\n\nMany wrongly told residents help was on its way and the advice was based purely on their personal expectations and assumptions. \u201cThat was very dangerous, because the whole concept of fire survival guidance rests on a well-founded expectation that the caller will ultimately be rescued.\u201d There was poor communication between the control room and the fire and no TV was turned on to show images of the fire.\n\nMany saved lives. \u201cA notable example is the courage and calm of Heidi Fox in coaxing Marcio Gomes and his family ... down from floor 21.\u201d While there was \u201cwidespread failure\u201d to comply with regulations, Moore-Bick did not conclude errors cost lives.\n\nConstruction industry\n\nMoore-Bick said the rapid spread of the fire across Grenfell Tower remained \u201cprofoundly shocking\u201d and in one of his most significant findings, ruled the 2014-2016 refurbishment of the tower breached building regulations. This will pile pressure on the companies involved in the works ahead of the inquiry\u2019s second phase. The main reason for the spread of the fire were the cladding panels, manufactured by Arconic, \u201cwith polyethylene cores, which had high calorific value, melted and acted as a source of fuel for the growing fire\u201d. The design of the refurbishment, overseen by Studio E Architects, as well as the insulation materials made by Celotex and Kingspan, also contributed, he said.\n\nRecommendations\n\nA law requiring owners and managers of high-rise residential buildings to provide their local fire and rescue service with information about external wall materials and building plans.\n\nFire brigade inspections of high-rise buildings to be improved and crews trained to carry out more thorough risk evaluations. Regular inspections of lifts intended to be used by firefighters are needed.\n\nCommunications between fire brigade control rooms, where emergency calls are received, and incident commanders must improve and there must be a dedicated communication link.\n\nGovernment should develop national guidelines for carrying out partial or total evacuations of high-rise residential buildings.\n\nFire doors in all multi-occupancy, residential properties should be urgently inspected.\n\nImprovements should be made to the data links provided by helicopters of the National Police Air Service. Pictures transmitted on the night of Grenfell could not be viewed by the LFB because the encryption was incompatible with its receiving equipment.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Firefighters \u2018stay put\u2019 tactics and lack of preparation and construction criticised", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott", "Robert Booth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7be0a26b8fa28d2714e264bb1559ea17428c9fe3/0_0_3323_1993/master/3323.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f92ab77252f325fce63568ccfed00f77", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
