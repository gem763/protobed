The UAW International expects to have a final tally after the 4 p.m. vote deadline Friday.\n\nUAW Local 598, which represents an estimated 4,800 workers at the Flint assembly plant, said Thursday on Facebook that its members passed the agreement overwhelmingly Wednesday, on a total vote of 60.9% in favor to 39.1% against. Actual vote totals were not available.\n\nUAW Local 598 members go in to cast their ratification vote in the UAW and General Motors national agreement at the Union City Fields in Flint on Wednesday, October 23, 2019.

Both production workers and skilled trades passed the measure, although skilled trades was higher at almost 69% in favor.\n\n'I have no spare money': UAW-GM labor fight spotlights the struggles of temp workers\n\nGM, UAW strike deal: Automaker, union reach tentative agreement on new contract\n\nBecause ratification requires a simple majority of the total vote, it's not essential for each local to pass the agreement. And with other large locals in Arlington, Texas, and Fort Wayne, Indiana, still to record their results, the final tally remains unclear.\n\nOther notable votes from the Automotive News tracker:\n\nUAW Local 22, which represents an estimated 729 workers at Detroit-Hamtramck, passed the agreement. Approximately 77% of production workers and 78% of skilled trades voted yes. Actual vote totals were not available.\n\nUAW Local 774, which represents members at the GM Tonawanda Engine Plant in Buffalo, New York, rejected the contract with 51%, or 603 members, saying no and 49%, or 579 members, saying yes.\n\nUAW Local 1112 representing members at Lordstown Assembly in Ohio rejected the tentative agreement with 87%, or 412 members, saying no and 13%, or 61 members, saying yes.\n\nWhat the contract calls for\n\nThe contract, over its four-year life, would bring in-progression workers up to tier-one wages, create a pathway for temporary workers to get hired, allow the union a voice in how many temps GM can hire, provide wage increases and retain the union's low health care costs.\n\nIt also saves the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant, which gets an electric pickup and a line of SUVs to build. GM will invest $3 billion in the plant, which also will assemble batteries, and create about 2,000 jobs there.\n\nThe deal also lets GM keep three sites idled: Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, and transmission plants in Warren and Baltimore. Likewise, some workers complain it does not provide enough guarantees that future products will be built at U.S. plants. And, they say there are loopholes that could allow GM to drag its feet on hiring some temps permanently.\n\nStrikers picket outside of GM Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Tuesday, Oct. 22, 2019.

Ratification takes 50% plus one person to pass.\n\nIf it's ratified, UAW workers will receive a bonus of $11,000 and temporary workers will get $4,500.\n\nGM will notify union workers through the normal channels on when they should return to work, which is certain to be as quickly as possible. The strike cost the company $450 million a week, the Center for Automotive Research estimated, interrupted production of key vehicles and will delay delivery of the 2020 mid-engine Corvette Stingray.\n\nGM will likely call back skilled trades employees first to work overnight or early Saturday to prepare the plants to restart. It will then notify all its other workers when to report to work.\n\nIf members reject the tentative agreement, the union members will remain on a nationwide strike earning $275 a week in strike wages. UAW negotiators would likely research why members voted no to it, then go back to the bargaining table to renegotiate a more acceptable deal.\n\nIn 2015, FCA union members rejected the tentative contract. The UAW negotiation team met to determine what the problems were, returned to the bargaining table to renegotiate. It took an extra two weeks, but the renegotiated tentative agreement passed by 77%.\n\nResults from earlier voting\n\nLocal 160, which represents 1,335 workers at GM's Tech Center in Warren, voted Sunday on the tentative agreement with 85% voting yes to ratify.\n\nLocal 668, which represents 476 union workers at GM's Saginaw Metal Casting Operations plant, voted Sunday to ratify with 73% skilled trades and 75% of production workers voting yes.\n\nLocal 14, which represents about 1,500 workers at GM's Toledo Transmission plant, voted Monday to ratify by 80%.\n\nLocal 909, which represents idled Warren Transmission plant, voted to ratify.\n\nLocal 1590, which represents 83 workers at Martinsburg Parts Distribution Center in West Virginia voted to ratify.\n\nLocal 1853, which represents 3,300 workers in Spring Hill, Tennessee, voted Monday to reject it by 51%.\n\nEric D.
