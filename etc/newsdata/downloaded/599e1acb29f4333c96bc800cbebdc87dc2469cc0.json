The molecule is called urolithin A. However, the way pomegranate contributes to this is rather tricky.\n\nTo understand this, let's dive into human cells. We've studied in school science classes that mitochondria are known as the batteries of the cell. And with time as it breaks down, it gets recycled. Oddly, as we get older, the recycling process (called mitophagy) doesn't remain as effective as it is during a younger age.\n\nThis results in mitochondria getting clogged up in our cells and causes several problems mostly in muscles and other tissues. Thus recovering from an injury during a young age heals faster than recovering during old age.\n\nDon't Miss 18.6 K SHARES 13.6 K SHARES 5 K SHARES 3.6 K SHARES 4.5 K SHARES\n\nNow no medication has solved mitophagy, however, researchers at EPFA have shown that urolithin A can restart this process with a similar intensity. There have been tests done in mice and nematode worms that have shown positive results and they're getting closer for it to be tested on humans.\n\nWhile this might seem interesting, it doesn't mean you'll only consume pomegranate to stop your body from ageing. Pomegranates consist of a compound called ellagitannins which when mixed with water inside our gut results in the creation of ellagic acid. When the gut bacteria feasts on this, it generates the molecule urolithin A.\n\nRawpixel\n\nOddly enough the way it works in our body is not as simple as it seems. Urolithin A works with a particular gut bacteria, but the production of urolithin will vary depending on whether your body has specific bacteria or not. However, EPFA researchers are now working on artificially producing urolithin A doses to help us age slower.\n\nTill then, you can keep consuming pomegranate, as it can never reduce the chances.", "description": "Pomegranates are known to be one of the most nutritious fruits with a bunch of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals to help us stay healthy.
