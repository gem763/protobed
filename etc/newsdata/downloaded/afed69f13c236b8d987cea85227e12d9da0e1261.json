The result is that more pilots are turning to commercial work over private contracts.\n\nIn the past, jet owners could afford to pick and choose who piloted their aircraft. Now, the pilots can be choosier with the work they accept.\n\nIn the UK alone, 2,500 pilots are needed Colibri said.\n\nIt also means that any jet owners strapped for cash could struggle to sell their planes to a new buyer, Colibri said.\n\nOliver Stone, managing director at Colibri, said: 'The world needs some 98,000 new business aviation pilots between now and 2038 to meet growing demand.\n\nBoeing released this chart earlier this year to predict how many pilots would need to be recruited around the world over the next 20 years\n\n'However, the business aviation sector is struggling to compete with airlines in recruiting pilots.\n\n'This means commercial airlines are not only recruiting existing business aviation pilots, they are also getting the pick of newly qualified pilots.\n\nGLOBAL PILOT SHORTAGE The shortage has been caused by a perfect storm of factors; a growing demand for travel and dwindling number of new trainees. In recent years, air travel has become more affordable and accessible to the masses thanks to more people understanding how to use air miles and factor them in to their financial habits. At the same time, it has become more difficult to become a pilot. In the US, the rules changed in 2013 to make it more difficult. Trainees had to have 1,500 hours of flying time before they could get a license to fly on a commercial or regional plane, whereas before the requirement was only 250 hours. It was the result of a 2009 crash in Buffalo, New York, in which all 49 people on board an aircraft died. While the rewards at the other end of the pilot's training are enticing, young prospects are being turned off by the daunting requirements. Couple with that is the fact that pilots must retire aged 65 and that fewer are also entering the military - another former source of personnel. Airlines have described the resultant shortage it as the biggest challenge facing the industry. Boeing has estimated that to keep up with the increasing number of travelers in the country, another 800,000 pilots are needed over the next 20 years.\n\n'This issue is increasingly impacting the sale of some private jets, and we expect it to continue.'\n\nPilots on commercial airlines can earn attractive salaries, with wages for British Airways captains starting at \u00a375,000 ($92,000) according to the Balpa union.\n\nThe regularity of the work also makes it highly attractive, although recent strikes by pilots at British Airways and Ryanair \u2013 and potential strikes at Virgin Atlantic \u2013 have all left a dent in relations with management.\n\nOwning a private jet can be a pricey business. After purchasing the plane \u2013 for around \u00a35 million \u2013 the buyer must also pay for fuel, storage, airport fees and staff.\n\nAlasdair Whyte, co-founder of Corporate Jet Investor, explained the changes.\n\nHe said: 'In the past it used to be jet owners who had their pick of the pilots, putting them through a rigorous interview process.\n\n'Now it's starting to go the other way with pilots interviewing owners who have to convince them to fly their aircraft.\n\n'As part of this process, some business aviation pilots are also commanding very attractive financial packages \u2013 in some cases up to $300,000 (\u00a3243,000).'\n\nThe global pilot shortage has been well documented.\n\nEarlier this year, the CEO of Boeing said the world needed another 800,000 pilots over the next 20 years to keep up with the growing demand for travel.\n\n'If you look at those 44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years, to go along with that we need about 800,000 new pilots, 750,000 new aviation technicians and so building that talent pipeline for the future is really important.\n\n'That\u2019s an area where Boeing will be making additional investments,' Dennis Muilenburg said in June.\n\nHe described it as one of the biggest challenges facing the industry.", "description": "Between now and 2038 the UK will need to find around 2,500 pilots for private jets or billionaire tycoons may find themselves grounded, according to a private jet aircraft seller.", "authors": ["Jennifer Newton For Mailonline", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/14/19397598-0-image-a-59_1570455691161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
