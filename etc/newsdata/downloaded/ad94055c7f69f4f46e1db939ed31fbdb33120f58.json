Jim Jordan (Ohio), the committee\u2019s ranking Republican.\n\nCummings\u2019s decision was expected, but the partisan exchange highlighted how Republicans hope to undermine support for statehood by painting the District as a haven for corruption \u2014 an argument the GOP has used in the past.\n\nCummings noted that every state faces allegations against its elected officials, whether Democrat or Republican. In the past decade, he said, the Justice Department has successfully prosecuted public corruption in all 13 states represented by Republican members of the committee.\n\nHouse GOP wants Jack Evans to testify at D.C. statehood hearing so \u2018cloud of scandal\u2019 can be examined.\n\nSpeaking of Jordan\u2019s own state, Cummings said former Ohio state legislator Peter Beck (R) was convicted on 13 criminal charges in 2015, and former state House speaker Cliff Rosenberger (R) has been under federal investigation for public corruption since 2018.\n\n\u201cState officials in Ohio have been the subject of multiple political scandals for many years, but nobody has seriously questioned Ohio\u2019s fitness to be a state or threatened to eliminate the votes of its elected representatives in Congress,\u201d Cummings wrote.\n\nCumming was responding to a letter sent to him Tuesday by Jordan and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.). They said the oversight committee needed to examine the \u201ccloud of scandal\u201d over Evans as part of its discussions of D.C. statehood. They noted Evans would effectively be elevated to state legislator if the District became the 51st state.\n\nThe oversight hearing Thursday on a bill to grant D.C. statehood will be the first in 25 years. At the Republicans\u2019 request, Cummings has invited, as a minority witness, a legal expert who will argue that D.C. statehood is unconstitutional.\n\nEvans is currently the subject of three investigations, which sprang from allegations that he used his official positions as a D.C. Council member and former Metro board chairman to help his personal legal and consulting businesses. The probes are being conducted by the U.S. attorney for the District, an outside law firm retained by the D.C. Council and the Metro inspector general.\n\nThe scandal already has forced Evans to resign from the Metro board and be stripped of his powerful position as chair of the D.C. Council finance committee.", "description": "Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E.
