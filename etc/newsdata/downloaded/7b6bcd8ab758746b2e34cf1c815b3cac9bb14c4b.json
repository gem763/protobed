The breach happened a while ago, but I realised only when I found my playlists \u2013 meticulous track listings crystallised over many years and holding many memories \u2013 had been erased. This was too cruel to be a friend using my account, my first thought when I noticed the unfamiliar music.\n\nIt turns out my account was being used by someone else. This user\u2019s name was (apparently) \u201cJuan de Juanes\u201d, and he lived in Spain. Juan de Juanes! As trolling hacker names go, an ersatz Spanish version of Joe Bloggs is surely up there. I contacted Spotify and the situation was remedied. All trace of Juanes \u2013 his Spanish songs I didn\u2019t understand, intriguing track names full of upside down exclamation marks \u2013 were gone.\n\nThe thing is, before I realised the changes were malicious, I was delighted. Juanes\u2019 choices skewed the algorithms that auto-generate music I might like, and so sometimes it was his selection I heard. This was stuff I might never otherwise hear; it was new and thrilling.

Increasingly these things make my world, but it\u2019s a world whose scope has been predetermined and limited.\n\nOccasionally my mother complains I won\u2019t watch TV with her. \u201cTV\u2019s rubbish,\u201d I reply. \u201cEndless flicking through crap, and if we find something we like, we\u2019ve missed half of it anyway.\u201d But then I remember my teen years, and the late-night foreign films I\u2019d stumble on; or a few years ago, watching a surprisingly compelling caterpillar documentary in a hospital waiting room.
