Both design firms have also been expanding their range of services into a wider range of services, such as big data analysis and curating spaces and events.\n\nBut while Hassell does not do much residential work, the decision comes at a time when the residential construction is slowing - new housing approvals fell to a seven-year-low in August - and pay for architects, often seen as the canary in the construction industry coalmine, is falling at a time when firms are cutting fees in the competitive environment.\n\nHassell's current projects in the city include the super fund-backed $165-million Adelaide Airport terminal expansion and Charter Hall's $250-million GPO Exchange project.\n\n\"There is a lot of disappointment,\" said David Hassell, managing principal of the firm's Adelaide office from 1999 to 2008, and whose father Colin Hassell in 1938, with colleagues Philip R. Claridge and Jack McConnell, designed the Modern Art Deco building at 2 King William Street for the Bank of NSW in what would be the first project of the firm they founded a year later.\n\n\"The very first building was the Bank of NSW on the corner of King William Street and North Terrace,\" Mr Hassell told the Financial Review. \"That was acknowledged as one of the leading pieces of architecture of the time, not only in Adelaide but around the country.\"\n\nThe firm expanded its reputation with the Adelaide Festival Centre, the first of Australia's performing arts centres, the first sketches for which were drawn in 1969, was built in three stages and completed in 1980.\n\nA 1972 model of the Adelaide Festival Centre complex designed by Hassell and completed eight years later in 1980.\n\n\"Later we did the Adelaide Festival Theatre complex and that again, in the late 60s, led to another jump in our profile,\" Mr Hassell said.\n\n\"It\u2019s grown exponentially from there.\"\n\nThe departure of the firm from its home town follows the 2014 collapse of another Adelaide-based firm, Woodhead, which was about to run out of money before it was salvaged by engineer GHD.\n\nWoods Bagot, Australia's largest architecture firm and one that also started in Adelaide, is maintaining a presence in its birthplace. Last month the firm celebrated its 150th birthday with a party inside its first-ever project - the city's St Peter's Cathedral.", "description": "The design firm's decision reflects a growing focus on large urban projects beyond the scale of a smaller capital like Adelaide.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.186%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_141/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ad12cc24efd58e7a02ff3936ca1dc372e2069fc2", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
