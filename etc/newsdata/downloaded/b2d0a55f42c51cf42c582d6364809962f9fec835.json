You look at it through a grown-up lens and think, 'Wow, I was a kid.' There were a number of situations that were not good.\"\n\nZOE KRAVITZ'S CATWOMAN CASTING PRAISED BY HALLE BERRY, MICHELLE PFEIFFER\n\nThe star didn\u2019t identify the person she said behaved inappropriately with her other than to note he or she was a \u201chigh-powered person in the industry.\u201d She also declined to share details of the encounter.\n\n\u201cLike one incident \u2014 I am not going to share \u2014 but I look back and I cringe,\" Pfeiffer explained. \"I was really uncomfortable and it was inappropriate.
