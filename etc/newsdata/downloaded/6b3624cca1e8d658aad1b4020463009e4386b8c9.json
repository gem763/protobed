But it might have left supporters who have wanted him to lead their party for years feeling a little flat.\n\nIn some respects, it was classic Johnson.\n\nThe UK will leave the EU on October 31, \"come what may.\"\n\nIn many ways, the speech was \"classic Johnson.\" Photo: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nThere were spending pledges for his domestic audience and attacks on the leader of the opposition Labour party as \"fratricidal anti-Semitic Marxists.\"\n\nIt was a feel-good speech, rather than a policy heavy speech.\n\nJohnson played up the prospect of leaving without a deal \u2013 something that goes down well with the Conservative party membership. But he also said that \"this is not an anti-European party and it is not an anti-European country. We love Europe. We are European.\"\n\nThis was somewhat less appreciated by the membership than the revelation that Johnson's mother voted for Brexit.\n\nJohnson has on the whole had a good first conference as leader. However, one thing that scares the Brexit-supporting party membership is whether Johnson will sell them out when the going gets tough.\n\nThis speech will have done little to reassure them that Johnson is 100% on their side.", "description": "View the latest news and breaking news today for U.S., world, weather, entertainment, politics and health at CNN.com.", "authors": ["Cnn'S Luke Mcgee At The Conservative Party Conference In Manchester", "Cnn'S Lindsay Isaac", "Cnn'S Luke Mcgee"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190930131045-01-boris-johnson-0930-super-tease.jpg"}
