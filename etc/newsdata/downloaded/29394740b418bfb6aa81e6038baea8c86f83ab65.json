The world\u2019s leading search engine has been outed for backing \u201cmore than a dozen\u201d companies which have campaigned against climate legislation or called for a withdrawal of environmental protections implemented by the American government.\n\nIn defence of its investment policy, Google claims it donates to many organisations from across the political spectrum, all of which advocate \u201cstrong technology policies\u201d. However, over 12 of these companies have been shown to question the need for environmental reform in the US. One notable organisation is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) which is thought to have influenced Donald Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the UN Paris Agreement on mitigating climate change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy,\u201d maintains a spokesperson from Google.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle's website does state that sponsorship does not necessarily mean it endorses an organisation's \u201centire agenda, its events or advocacy positions nor the views of its leaders or members.\u201d However, the tech giant refused to tell The Guardian how much it has given to the organisations in question.\n\nThe news comes despite Google\u2019s continued assertion that it supports political action against the climate crisis. It publicised its \u201cbiggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history\u201d in mid-September, claiming that \u201csustainability has been one of Google\u2019s core values from our earliest days.\u201d\n\nBut questions have been raised about the search engine\u2019s willingness to act, with hundreds of Google and Amazon employees joining climate-change marches in San Francisco and Seattle just last month. They claimed their employers had been too slow to address global warming and drastic action was necessary.", "description": "The tech giant has been called out for funding companies who do not support environmental reform.", "authors": ["Maeve Campbell"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/39/66/1000x563_cmsv2_5f866d68-ec72-5073-8820-224cb8bdb0a9-4223966.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
