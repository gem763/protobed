The supply constraint is caused by, among others, five generating units that are unavailable due to boiler tube leaks.\u201d\n\nIt also apologised to customers: \u201cWe unreservedly apologise to South Africans for the negative impact this may have on them and want to assure the nation that we continue to work tirelessly to ensure the security of energy supply.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on 702\u2019s Eusebius McKaiser Show, Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer said: \u201cYesterday, we didn\u2019t anticipate to lose two units and another one overnight. This has, unfortunately, brought us to the state that we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nEskom said two of its units capable of producing 1,200 megawatts collectively tripped unexpectedly on Tuesday night.\n\nThis was due to a boiler tube leak and an object which was found inside a part.\n\nOberholzer said they were also caught off guard but were working to resolve capacity issues.\n\nLast week, the struggling SOE also said it would be challenging energy regulator Nersa\u2019s latest tariff decision, warning that it would result in another financial disaster.\n\nNersa granted Eskom increases of 9.4% and 5.2% over three years while the utility had asked for 21%.\n\nStage two load shedding means those affected areas will be without power for about four hours.\n\nThe power utility also urged residents to continue using electricity sparingly throughout the day by:\n\n\u2022 Setting air-conditioners\u2019 average temperature at 23\u00baC;\n\n\u2022 Switching off your geysers over peak periods;\n\n\u2022 Using the cold water tap rather than using the geyser every time;\n\n\u2022 Setting your swimming pool pump cycle to run twice a day, three hours at a time for optimal energy use;\n\n\u2022 And at the end of the day, turning off computers, copiers, printers and fax machines at the\n\nswitch. Avoid standby or sleep mode.\n\nA debilitating round of power cuts in February and March dented first-quarter economic output and reminded investors of the uphill struggle President Cyril Ramaphosa faces to revive Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy.\n\nEskom produces more than 90% of the power in South Africa but has been hobbled by technical faults at its fleet of coal-fired power stations as well as a financial crisis that has severely hurt its liquidity position.\n\nThe government plans to split Eskom into three units for generation, transmission and distribution to make it more efficient. It is also giving Eskom bailouts to keep it afloat.\n\nHere\u2019s how to check the load shedding schedule.\n\nEWN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Eskom: Load Shedding Could Last A Week appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "Eskom: Load Shedding Could Last A Week", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/World_News_10_800x533_L_1420026292.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
