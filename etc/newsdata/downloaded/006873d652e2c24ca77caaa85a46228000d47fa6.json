No further details were given as to how the process would work and which developers would be involved.\n\nThe Hong Kong stock exchange\u2019s property sub-index rose more than 2% after the measures were announced.\n\nBefore Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the colonial administration often deployed the ordinance to take property for public use, offering compensation to landowners.\n\nBut no leader has been able to successfully take back land from private developers since the handover.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is seen on a screen as she reacts to protests by pro-democracy lawmakers, at the Legislative Council in Hong Kong, China, October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nFIVE DEMANDS\n\nEarlier, pro-democracy lawmakers shouted \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d as they heckled Lam, who faces immense pressure to regain trust and resolve the city\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades, in a disruption that forced the meeting to be adjourned twice.\n\nThe dissenting legislators managed to project the call for \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d, which has become a pr-democracy movement rallying cry, onto a backdrop behind Lam as she tried to deliver her speech.\n\nThe demands include universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into what they say has been excessive force by police in dealing with demonstrations.\n\nSome of the protesting lawmakers wore masks of Chinese President Xi Jinping inside the chamber.\n\nPro-democracy legislator Tanya Chan said Lam was to blame for Hong Kong\u2019s chaos.\n\n\u201cBoth her hands are soaked with blood,\u201d an emotional Chan said at a news conference after the policy session was adjourned.\n\n\u201cWe hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits. She has no governance ability ... she is not suitable to be chief executive.\u201d\n\nSecurity was tight ahead of Lam\u2019s third policy address, with riot police and water cannon on standby.\n\nShe was speaking hours after the U.S. House of Representatives passed three pieces of legislation related to the Hong Kong protests, drawing a swift rebuke from Beijing, which accused the lawmakers of \u201csinister intentions\u201d of undermining stability in the Asian financial hub.\n\nOne of the measures, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would require the U.S. secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong retained its autonomy in order to keep receiving the special treatment that has allowed it to be a major financial centre.\n\nLam has ruled out making any concessions to the protesters in the face of escalating unrest, saying, \u201cViolence would only breed more violence.\u201d\n\nRAINBOW\n\nProtesters are angry at what they see as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the city which was guaranteed 50 years of freedoms under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement upon its return to China.\n\nBeijing rejects that accusation and says Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, are stirring up trouble.\n\nLam said her government would uphold \u201cone country, two systems\u201d while she warned that Hong Kong\u2019s economy was suffering badly, with the city expected to enter a technical recession in the third quarter. The labour market is facing layoff pressure in the short term, she added.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nAuthorities have arrested more than 2,300 people since June when the unrest escalated, scores of them teenagers, some as young as 12 and the oldest 83.\n\nEnding her address on a positive note, Lam said the city faced its \u201cmost formidable challenge\u201d since 1997, but by restoring law and order, it would \u201cemerge from the storm and embrace the rainbow\u201d.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced measures aimed at easing a housing shortage on Wednesday as she battles to restore confidence in her administration and address widespread discontent after four months of anti-government protests.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441347013&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F08M", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
