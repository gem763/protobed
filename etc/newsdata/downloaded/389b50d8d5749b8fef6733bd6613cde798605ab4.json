Chicago\u2019s mayor also stayed away from the president.\n\nThe Chicago police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, sat out Trump\u2019s speech to a national convention of police officers that was being held in the city, in order to protest the president\u2019s immigration policies and frequently divisive rhetoric, he had said.\n\nTrump shot back at the event: \u201cThere is one person who is not here today.\u201d He went on: \u201cWhere is he? I want to talk to him. In fact, more than anyone else, this person should be here because maybe he could learn something, and that\u2019s the superintendent of the Chicago police, Eddie Johnson.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s decision to boycott the event angered the city\u2019s chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, which said in a Facebook post: \u201cSuch a gesture would be an insult to both President Trump and the office of the presidency itself and would be a mark of disgrace upon the city throughout the entire nation, including mayor Lori Lightfoot.\u201d\n\n'Not welcome here': protesters prepare for Trump Chicago visit Read more\n\nBut Lightfoot, a Democrat and the relatively newly elected mayor of the city, and Illinois\u2019 Democratic governor stood in solidarity with Johnson.\n\n\u201cThis is the land of Lincoln and when you come to the state of Illinois, you should respect all the people who live here in the state of Illinois,\u201d said the governor, JB Pritzker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that @realDonaldTrump brought his insulting, ignorant buffoonery to Chicago,\u201d the mayor tweeted. \u201cLuckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone no matter how high the office denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators rally downtown during a protest against Trump\u2019s visit. Photograph: Max Herman/Reuters\n\nTrump has frequently criticized Chicago for its crime problems and status as a sanctuary city, one of scores of cities around the country that refuse to work with federal authorities to round up people who are living in the US illegally.\n\nAt a news conference later on Monday, Johnson said Trump had ignored a \u201cdouble-digit\u201d reduction in violent crime over the past three years.\n\nTrump has long held up Chicago as the poster child of urban violence and dysfunctional Democratic politics.\n\nHe was attending the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference and a political fundraiser.\n\n\n\nThe FOP Lodge 7, which represents rank-and-file Chicago police officers, meanwhile, announced that it had cast a vote of no confidence in Johnson. The union president, Kevin Graham, greeted Trump after he landed in the city.\n\nIn the speech, Trump rattled off Chicago crime statistics and claimed that Johnson puts the needs of people living in the US illegally above those of \u201claw-abiding residents\u201d of Chicago. He called the city \u201cembarrassing\u201d.\n\nTrump signed an executive order creating a presidential commission on law enforcement to study issues including substance abuse, homelessness and mental illness, and announced a federal crackdown on violent crime.\n\nThen he headlined a campaign luncheon at his hotel in the city.\n\nThousands of demonstrators rallied outside, waving signs that said \u201cImpeach Trump now\u201d and \u201cQuid pro quo, Trump must go\u201d. Some also chanted \u201cLock him up\u201d, in an echo of what Trump faced at the World Series baseball game he attended in Washington the evening before.", "description": "President calls city haven for criminals at event boycotted by mayor and police superintendent", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1800a0792956b42f39eabd8b409083937e6191fe/0_95_1620_972/master/1620.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dedf00c73134ae311bed330f412a36e3", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
