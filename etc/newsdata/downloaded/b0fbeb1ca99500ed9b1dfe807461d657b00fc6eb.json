Cheika has selected 19-year-old Jordan Petaia at outside-centre. He is the youngest player to start there in a World Cup, for any team.\n\nPetaia has played only 100 minutes of Test rugby, on the wing against Uruguay and Georgia. When he found out about it, Eddie Jones could not resist pointing out that the pressure could get to the kid. Cheika was having none it. \u201dI trust him infinitely,\u201d he said. \u201dIt\u2019s going to be fast and aggressive but I know he will rise up to that challenge, I\u2019ve seen it in him.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand name strong team from embarrassment of riches for Ireland Read more\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been too fast or aggressive yet. Jones and Cheika, two old teammates and rivals, have been on their best behaviour. And Cheika was not in the mood to pick over Jones\u2019s own selections. \u201cI always say, but no one seems to believe me, my focus is always on Australia,\u201d he said. Besides, he added: \u201cMost of that stuff is, what\u2019s the word, fake news? I mean, none of us is giving out our tactics in real life, know what I mean? We\u2019d be mad if we did. So that stuff is irrelevant. Turn up. Be ready. Play what\u2019s in front of you. Know what you want to get, and then go out there and get it. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nIt was left to Matt Toomua to stir things up a bit. Toomua spent three seasons at Leicester, and was delighted to have the chance to get stuck into his old teammates. \u201cI know all of their weaknesses\u201a\u201c he joked. \u201cI can list them now for you if you want: Manu Tuilagi is a terrible snooker player, George Ford never pays for a beer, Ben Youngs isn\u2019t even the best rugby player in his own family, Jonny May is very weird, and Dan Cole doesn\u2019t have a personality.\u201d\n\nToomua, who is on the bench, is pretty familiar with Petaia too. Their families are so close they call themselves cousins. So he has been keeping an eye on him this week. \u201cI\u2019ve just trying to make it all as normal as possible for him,\u201d Toomua said, \u201cobviously there is a lot of noise, it\u2019s a quarter-final, so it\u2019s about trying to normalise the experience for him as much as possible, help keep him calm.\u201d\n\nIt is not just the occasion from which he has been trying to protect him. Petaia has been in the news, too, because the Sydney Morning Herald reported last week that his mother went undercover to expose what was going on in Israel Folau\u2019s family church. Helen Petaia said she used a fake name to swap emails with Folau\u2019s cousin, and had even infiltrated their congregation, which she described as an \u201cisolated hate group\u201d. She passed on what she had learned to the papers. The upshot was that Folau\u2019s cousin got sacked from his casual job at St Gregory\u2019s Boarding school.\n\nFolau is taking legal action against his former employers Rugby Australia and the NSW Waratahs for unfair dismissal, after he was sacked for posting social media messages that said \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters\u201d were going to hell. The Australian has since reported that his \u201cformer teammates\u201d felt \u201cutter disbelief\u201d that Petaia had gone to such \u201cextreme lengths\u201d to get involved in the case. She has said she was only trying to protect her son and others from Folau\u2019s influence.\n\nQuick guide Australia team Show Hide K Beale; R Hodge, J Petaia, S Kerevi, M Koroibete; C Lealifano, W Genia; S Sio, T Latu, A Alaalatoa, I Rodda, R Arnold, D Pocock, M Hooper (capt), I Naisarani. Replacements: J Uelese, J Slipper, T Tupou, A Coleman, L Salakaia-Loto, N White, M Toomua, J O\u2019Connor.\n\nCheika and his players did not want to go anywhere near the topic, which is understandable, and they denied that it had even come up in conversation. They are hoping that it will blow over when Jordan Petaia makes a few headlines of his own. He certainly has the talent to do it. \u201cFrom the first weekend I saw him in training at Queensland I\u2019ve thought he\u2019s going to be one of the greats,\u201d said Samu Kerevi, who starts inside him. He agrees with Toomua that 13 is Petaia\u2019s best position. \u201cIt means we can get that ball in his hands a bit earlier and just let him go and do his thing.\u201d\n\nPicking Petaia was not the only surprise Cheika sprang. He has paired Will Genia and Christian Lealifano at half-back. It is the fifth change he has made there in five games. And he has brought Reece Hodge straight back in on the wing, too, after his ban. \u201cThey were was tight calls, but I felt I wasn\u2019t going to lose either way,\u201d Cheika said. He was not going to explain them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give the reasons why, I don\u2019t want to tell the other team what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d All you need to know, he said, is that the match is going to be won by the team \u201dwho wants to attack more\u201d. And that, he said, is where Australia have the edge. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle of wills. But the fear inside us is dead. We\u2019re not afraid to go there and get it. And that means it is going to be a great game.\u201d", "description": "Michael Cheika has selected 19-year-old Jordan Petaia at outside-centre for Australia in the World Cup quarter-final against England on Saturday", "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df0bd31ae6421a867e7c2bd63468ff57c0fc23ad/0_275_2348_1408/master/2348.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0ca1e6208375eef4da1ecd0c3bc9fc2", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
