Reminder: There are 129 days until the Iowa caucuses and 403 days until the 2020 election.\n\nEarlier this week, we explored how the ongoing impeachment drama might reshape the Democratic primary contest and the subsequent presidential election.\n\nBut how could it alter the battle for control of Congress?\n\nOn Thursday, Business Insider released a poll that seemed to sum up the conventional wisdom. Asked whether launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rival Joe Biden would \u201cwork out in Democrats\u2019 favor electorally,\u201d 43 percent of respondents said it \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d would not. Only 32 percent said it probably or definitely would.\n\nPundits and partisans have been making the same prediction since the start of Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation in 2017. The American people don\u2019t like impeachment. Congressional Republicans suffered when they impeached Bill Clinton. Ergo, Congressional Democrats will suffer if they impeach Trump.\n\nFor months, this had been House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s rationale for resisting. Yes, the Democratic Party flipped 41 House seats in 2018, enough to regain control of the chamber. But those gains mean that in 2020, dozens of her members will be defending closely divided or even Republican-leaning districts, including 31 that Trump won in 2016. Without a significant shift in public sentiment, the thinking went, initiating an impeachment process likely to end with the GOP-controlled Senate refusing to convict Trump would only imperil those members \u2014 and the party\u2019s 17-seat majority.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., addresses reporters at the Capitol in Washington on Thursday.

What all the anxious analysis seems to have overlooked is that not all impeachments are created equal. Some come to be seen as partisan. Others come to be seen as justified.\n\nPelosi\u2019s pre-Ukraine worry was that pursuing Trump\u2019s impeachment would come to be seen as partisan. In today\u2019s hyperpolarized context, it still could. But even then, the historical record suggests that partisan impeachments don\u2019t inevitably lead to significant congressional losses for the party that pursued them.\n\nRecall the Clinton impeachment. Much has been made of the fact that in November 1998, a month after the GOP majority first voted to authorize the impeachment inquiry, Democrats flipped five seats in the House \u2014 the first time since 1834 that a president\u2019s party gained House seats in the sixth year of his term. The narrative has long been that Dems were boosted by backlash to impeachment.", "description": "Earlier this week, we explored how the ongoing impeachment drama might reshape the\u00a0Democratic primary contest\u00a0and the\u00a0subsequent presidential election.
