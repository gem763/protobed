Even just the threat of a Turkish offensive into northern Syria, we could see an abandonment of those facilities.\"\n\nPrisoners could walk away\n\nThe consensus among defence and security experts is that the Kurds would let the prisoners go, leaving detainees and their families free to either return home, or rejoin the insurgency.\n\nDunford said, in his estimation, getting back into the fight is the most likely scenario for prisoners who could be released.\n\nSome former Canadian ISIS fighters and their families have indicated they want to return home, but the Liberal government has said it's too difficult and northern Syria is too dangerous for Foreign Affairs staff.\n\nIn this 2017 photo, Kurdish soldiers from anti-terrorism units, background, stand in front of a suspected Islamic State member at a security centre in Kobani, Syria.

(Hussein Malla/Associated Press)\n\n\"Canada has been unwilling,\"said Nesbitt, who noted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointedly called on Canada at the end of August to take back its citizens detained in Syria.\n\n\"We don't have a political party that has said it would deal proactively with these fighters. Usually, it's leave them there \u2014 or some such policy. And now, we're seeing the repercussions of that.\"\n\nHeated debate in the Commons\n\nThe fate of former Canadian ISIS militants and their families has been the subject of heated debate on the floor of the House of Commons and Conservatives have been fundraising off the notion, accusing the Liberals of welcoming home jihadist fighters.\n\nNesbitt wouldn't comment on the politics, but said the result of policy inaction has boiled down to this: \"Who knows where they are going to go? At the very least, we no longer have control over them.\"\n\nPublic Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said earlier this year as many 60 foreign fighters have returned to Canada, but only a small number of them had travelled to Syria, Iraq and Turkey.\n\nMost, he said, had travelled elsewhere.\n\nIt has been suggested that gathering evidence overseas to prosecute them \u2014 at least to a standard acceptable to Canadian courts \u2014 would be difficult.\n\n\"I simply do not know what our rationale has been in following this course,\" Nesbitt said.\n\nKurds betrayed?\n\nMuch of the political narrative in Washington on Monday revolved around the notion that the withdrawal of U.S. forces was a betrayal of the Kurds, who were seen as being among the most capable fighters against ISIS.\n\nBut Ben Friedman, the policy director of Defense Priorities, another Washington-based strategic institute, said the policy of extracting the U.S. from the Syrian civil war is not wrong, but the execution has been horrible.\n\n\"My view is that we have the right end in wanting to withdraw,\" Friedman said during a conference call with reporters, \"but we have completely bolloxed up the means of doing that.\"\n\nThe Trump White House signalled early last winter that it wanted out of Syria and Friedman said the time in between should have been used to prepare the Kurds for that eventuality.\n\nCanada restricted its operations against the Islamic State to Iraq and never ventured into Syria.", "description": "Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria have warned they'll have to limit the guarding of ISIS prisoners as the U.S. prepares to stand aside in the event of Turkish invasion of the region - leavING the fate of dozens of Canadian detainees up in the air.", "authors": ["Defence", "Murray Brewster Is Senior Defence Writer For Cbc News", "Based In Ottawa.
