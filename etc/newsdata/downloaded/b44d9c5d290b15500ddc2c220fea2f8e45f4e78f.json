The win pushes Dallas atop the NFC East.\n\nDallas' three-game losing streak, however, still keeps them behind the other division leaders in the NFC \u2014 the San Francisco 49ers (6-0), New Orleans Saints (6-1) and Green Bay Packers (6-1) \u2014 all of whom won Sunday.\n\nOn Monday night, the New England Patriots will look to keep the NFL's roster of unbeatens at two.

He responded with the week\u2019s top fantasy performance at the position \u2014 150 total yards and three touchdowns. If Edmonds is still available in your fantasy league, he\u2019ll be this week\u2019s top waiver pickup.\n\nactive, but only in an emergency sense, the Arizona Cardinals gave second-year RB a full workload.

If Edmonds is still available in your fantasy league, he\u2019ll be this week\u2019s top waiver pickup. The surprise performance of the week goes to Colts WR Zach Pascal , who had six catches for 106 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He hasn\u2019t been very consistent, but the upside for Pascal is worth a small wager from your free agent budget.\n\n, who had six catches for 106 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He hasn\u2019t been very consistent, but the upside for Pascal is worth a small wager from your free agent budget. The Bengals had a pass-heavy approach vs. the Jaguars \u2014 giving wideout Alex Erickson nearly as many targets (14) as he previously had all season (15). He caught eight of them for 137 yards and also had a pair of rushing attempts. Erickson may only be a one-week fix with A.J. Green hoping to return after the Bengals\u2019 Week 9 bye.\n\nnearly as many targets (14) as he previously had all season (15).

Even the No. 3 wide receiver in Detroit can be fantasy-relevant. Adam Thielen injured his hamstring making a touchdown catch and the Vikings have a quick turnaround this week to play on Thursday. If Thielen isn\u2019t 100%, backup wideout Bisi Johnson could be a short-term fix. He caught four of his eight targets against the Lions for 40 yards and scored a touchdown.\n\n- Fantasy football: Valuable advice to help your team dominate\n\nChase Edmonds will be a popular waiver-wire pickup this week.
