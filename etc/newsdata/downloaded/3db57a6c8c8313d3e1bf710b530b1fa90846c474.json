The judge said such a shield for the president would be \u201cvirtually limitless\u201d and characterized Trump\u2019s claim of immunity as \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s fundamental structure and constitutional values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe appeal Wednesday is being heard by three judges \u2014 Robert A. Katzmann, Denny Chin and Christopher F. Droney \u2014 all of whom were nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\nThe subpoena for records from Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm remains on hold while the appeals court reviews the case. Vance\u2019s office agreed to pause enforcement of the subpoena if the president loses his appeal, so long as the president abides by an expedited timeline to ask the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors routinely subpoena banks and other financial firms for individual records as part of their investigations, but in this case the subject of the records is a sitting president.\n\nIn August, Vance subpoenaed Mazars USA as part of his examination into whether any state laws were broken in connection to the 2016 payments to two women who said they had affairs with Trump years earlier.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has denied the affairs and any wrongdoing in connection to the payments. The president\u2019s lawyers say it is unprecedented for a local prosecutor to seek the records of a sitting president. His legal team has called the subpoena to Mazars a \u201ca bad faith effort to harass the President by obtaining and exposing his private financial information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit is one of three cases in which Trump has sued investigators and the companies they subpoenaed to try to block access to his financial records. In the two other cases, Trump faces investigations that pre-date impeachment proceedings from congressional committees seeking his tax returns and financial documents.\n\nA federal appeals court in Washington this month ruled against the president and refused to block a House committee subpoena for Trump\u2019s records from Mazars. In that case, the court upheld Congress\u2019s oversight powers and broad authority to issue subpoenas for information.\n\nAD\n\nIn the New York case, the Justice Department has backed the president\u2019s position that the subpoena from Vance\u2019s office should be blocked. But the government lawyers did not fully embrace Trump\u2019s assertion that he is immune from all investigation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA subpoena directed at the president\u2019s records should be permitted only \u2018as a last resort,\u2019 \u201d the Justice Department said in its filing.\n\nAccording to Justice Department legal opinions, sitting presidents cannot be charged by federal prosecutors. But that guidance does not apply to grand jury investigations.\n\nVance\u2019s office is not bound by the federal guidelines and has discretion to bring charges in New York state courts.\n\nThe local investigation followed the conviction last year of Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen. He pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations for helping arrange payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal to keep their allegations of affairs with Trump from becoming public before the election.\n\nCohen has said Trump directed the payments and reimbursed him.\n\nAD", "description": "The case is a test of the sweep of presidential privilege and one of several battles over Trump\u2019s business records.", "authors": ["Ann E.
