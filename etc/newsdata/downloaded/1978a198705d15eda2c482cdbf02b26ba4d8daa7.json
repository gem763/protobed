Simply deploy the notorious \u201cI-word\u201d \u2014 and voila. Journalists believe they can suggest Mr. Trump will leave office amid mysterious \u201cproceedings\u201d and strategically manipulated press narratives. Or something.\n\nThe prospect of impeachment is also a convenient device to distract the public from Trump administration positives \u2014 from the nation\u2019s healthy economy to unprecedented job creation. Some observers say Democratic obsession with impeachment is a reflection of their own panic that Mr. Trump is going to win in 2020 \u2014 but that is another story.\n\nMeanwhile, the reality: Democrats and media are overlooking public opinion. Polls have confirmed for months that Americans are not interested in impeaching the president.\n\nA CNN survey released in May found that 54% of Americans said Mr. Trump should not be impeached. A Rasmussen Reports survey released a month later revealed that only 9% of Americans expected impeachment to happen. In August, a Politico/Morning Consult poll found that 52% of all voters said Congress should not stage impeachment proceedings; 90% of Republicans, 49% of independents and 19% of Democrats agreed.\n\nLast week, a Monmouth University poll finds that six-out-of-10 voters condemned impeachment while 52% agreed the House Judiciary Committee inquiry into the process is a \u201cbad idea.\u201d\n\nTheir reasons for that? The poll found that 27% said Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong, 22% said it would be a waste of time and money, 13% dismissed it as a partisan \u201cwitch hunt\u201d while 12% complained that Congress should be working on other issues. Others felt that it was too late in Mr. Trump\u2019s term of office to even start the process and that there was \u201cno point\u201d because the Senate would not vote to remove the president.\n\nOne high-profile analyst summed things up in a tidy way following special investigator Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony before Congress earlier this summer.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is over,\u201d noted ABC veteran correspondent Terry Moran.\n\nTHE POMPEO EFFECT\n\nThe lasting and productive tenure of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo likely annoys and mystifies the news media. Perhaps this longevity has been influenced by his unwavering sense of America\u2019s place on the planet.\n\n\u201cWhen President Trump came into office, people were confused that President Obama had traveled much of the globe apologizing for many of the things America had done around the world in the past,\u201d Mr. Pompeo told The Daily Signal, a news site associated with The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cI and President Trump have a very different take. Every place we go, America is a force for good. I believe that with all my heart. We don\u2019t always get it right. Not always perfect. But our efforts are noble and important, and we try to make America secure and at the same time improve the lives of people in every country to improve their capacity for freedom and liberty in their own nation,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cWhen you exert America\u2019s influence around the world in a way that is reflective of our country and its founding ideas of individual liberty and freedom, and a sense each nation has its own sovereign right to make decisions for itself, we\u2019re going to do things that are best for the American people,\u201d he observed.\n\nINTRODUCING CPAC WEST\n\nA new conservative entity arrives this weekend. That would be CPAC West, introduced by the American Conservative Union and the Morning in Nevada political action committee. There\u2019s a day-long strategy conference in Reno, Nevada on Friday, to be followed Saturday by the 5th Annual annual Basque Fry on the Corley Ranch in nearby Gardenville. There\u2019s also a prime directive at work.\n\n\u201cThe heavy hand of government and the terrible policies of the left have destroyed the lives of Californians. And now left-wing hordes are trying to take over Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and the other western states that previously served as the heart of Ronald Reagan\u2019s political base. We must make the West great again,\u201d the organizers advise.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s lineup includes American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp; Mercedes Schlapp, senior advisor to President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign; former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke; acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; possible U.S. Senate hopeful Corey Lewandowski and former acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\nNIGHTSTAND READING\n\nFiction stranger than truth, perhaps?
