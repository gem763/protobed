Manafort, who was convicted on corruption charges unrelated to the campaign, made sure to transfer his primary residence to his wife before he was sentenced \u2014 a home located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.\n\nBut for all the Russian social media help boosting Trump, it wouldn\u2019t have had much of an effect were it not for the fact that he has a legion of extremely loyal Florida followers.\n\nConsider the case of Club 45, a group of pro-Trump activists who hold events that sometimes draw as many 2,500 people. Stone has spoken there, along with Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and a favorite commentator of Trump\u2019s, former National Rifle Association spokesman Dan Bongino, a recent Florida transplant who lives in Martin County, which lies just north of Palm Beach County.\n\nA co-founder of the club, Joe Budd, said he has an \u201cemail list of Trump supporters just in Palm Beach County that\u2019s 12,000 strong,\u201d even though the club hasn\u2019t been officially approved or funded by the local GOP or the Trump campaign. Trump\u2019s residency fuels the enthusiasm of club members, he said.\n\n\u201cIt definitely has a positive effect. Mar-a-Lago is just down the road,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s support of DeSantis and Scott, who won squeaker victories in 2018, made the state resemble \u201cTrump Country\u201c even to Democrats, and ensured that Florida for the first time since Reconstruction has two Republican U.S. senators and a Republican governor, whose appointee is in charge of the state\u2019s elections division.\n\nTrump is so obsessed with the state that he made sure to hold his first official reelection rally in Florida. His campaign goes so far as to classify it as its own region.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s enemies list has grown in Florida, and Democrats point out they have a bigger staff on the ground than the president\u2019s campaign. They\u2019re also registering more voters than Republicans, and the voter rolls have added more minorities, who are more inclined to vote against the GOP, relative to this point in the election cycle when compared to the 2016 election.\n\nFlorida Playbook Our must-read briefing on what\u2019s hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

It\u2019s a blue county. But it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s second home. You\u2019ve got affluent retirees, who really don\u2019t have to do anything but go on vacation or play golf, who will stand out in the hot sun and wave signs as Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade go by,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people donate. They\u2019re super-voters. And more importantly, they engage in activism like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen. They hold events. They get people out to vote. They register voters. They go door-knocking.\u201d\n\nMatt Gaetz, who lives in the northwest corner of the state, a world from Mar-a-Lago\u2019s shores in Palm Beach, is Trump\u2019s most vociferous defender in Congress. He said Trump\u2019s Fort Lauderdale-based pollster, Fabrizio is \u201can added windfall in Florida \u2014 that someone who\u2019s part of the national strategy has such a keen understanding of our state.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s ties to the state pay off in policy \u2014 from extra hurricane disaster aid to help with Everglades restoration \u2014 Gaetz said, which could make a big difference in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight hard for Florida because Florida is the most important swing state in the nation. It\u2019s always very close,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cBut with the president being a part-time Floridian, with the president\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ron DeSantis as our governor, with a substantial portion of the campaign apparatus from my district in Pensacola to Brad Parscale\u2019s work in Fort Lauderdale, we better win Florida. If not, shame on us.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Kevin Cate", "Democratic Consultant"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ae/e1/07b6104345708a8dca974a6ef6d2/191025-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
