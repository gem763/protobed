The British prime minister insists the UK\u2019s plan for a revised Brexit divorce deal respects the Good Friday Agreement and avoids a hard border.\n\nUnder the plan, Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs union along with the rest of the UK. If there is no free trade agreement, checks would be needed between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The UK proposes automated solutions with checks away from the border.\n\nNorthern Ireland would stay subject to EU single market rules for agriculture, food and manufactured goods \u2013 creating a regulatory border with Great Britain. The arrangement would be subject to consent every four years from the Belfast authorities at Stormont.\n\nHere are various reactions to the Johnson plan among bodies representing farming and business in Northern Ireland. Many welcomed it as a starting point for negotiations, but are strongly critical of the UK proposals.\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson sets out UK plan reworking Irish backstop\n\nIvor Ferguson \u2013 President, Ulster Farmers\u2019 Union (news release):\n\nOn the single market : \u201cThe proposed all-island regulatory zone would help facilitate these crucial (free and frictionless) trading relationships.\u201d\n\n: \u201cThe proposed all-island regulatory zone would help facilitate these crucial (free and frictionless) trading relationships.\u201d On consent : \u201cHowever, more clarity is needed about how the four year Stormont consent process would work as this rule has the potential to put the industry in a prolonged cycle of uncertainty.\u201d\n\n: \u201cHowever, more clarity is needed about how the four year Stormont consent process would work as this rule has the potential to put the industry in a prolonged cycle of uncertainty.\u201d On customs: \u201cFrom 2021, WTO rules and tariffs will apply for all exports from NI unless the UK has a Free Trade Agreement in place. This does not give the certainty around tariff-free access that we require. It is essential for the livelihood of family-run farming businesses that this is confirmed.\u201d\n\nStephen Kelly \u2013 Chief Executive, Manufacturing Northern Ireland (BBC Radio):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than no-deal. If we ended up with this model, what it effectively means is we have two borders in an effort to try to solve one border. It means that Northern Ireland no longer has unfettered access, not just to the EU\u2019s market, but actually to the rest of the UK market as well\u2026 It adds such a level of cost and complexity that it will make (our) businesses unviable.\u201d\n\nTina McKenzie \u2013 Policy Chair, FSB Northern Ireland (National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses) (news release):\n\n\u201cThe proposals which have been published by the UK Government fall short of delivering the tariff-free, frictionless trade which our members currently enjoy and want to see maintained\u2026 While there are mentions of exemptions for small businesses we need to see further detail on how these would practically operate.\u201d\n\nMPANI \u2013 Mineral Products Association Northern Ireland (on Twitter):\n\n\u201cIt is clear the proposals do not deliver and maintain a seamless and frictionless trade border so that NI Business can trade N-S and E-W as they do now.\u201d\n\nRead more: Why is Boris Johnson's latest Brexit plan a headache for the EU? | Euronews Answers\n\nGlyn Roberts \u2013 Chief Executive, Retail NI (news release):\n\n\u201cThese proposals are a complete non-starter\u2026 The Prime Minister\u2019s plan would result in North to South tariffs which would cause huge negative impacts upon our farmers and the agri-food sector as a whole. Furthermore, it would also mean two borders requiring renewal after four years, surveillance in border communities without their consent and checks North-South and West-East.\u201d\n\nAodh\u00e1n Connolly \u2013 Director, Northern Ireland Retail Consortium (LinkedIn post):\n\n\u201cThis will lead to complexity, delays, tariffs, VAT and cost rises that will make NI goods less competitive and squeeze our household budgets. The measures are predicated on intrusive surveillance which will put a burden on business and be disruptive for border communities. In short these proposals are unworkable and unpalatable.\u201d\n\nBrian Irwin \u2013 Chair, Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association (NIFDA) and executive chairman, Irwin\u2019s Bakery (on Channel 4):\n\n\u201cTariffs in our particular category vary between 15 and 25 percent\u2026 If we end up outside of the customs union without some form of trade agreement, which is yet to be negotiated, that is the default position (under the Johnson plan). Tariffs that could be created if we were left with a WTO-type tariff arrangement, would present a wall of cost that many Northern Ireland food companies could not trade through.\u201d\n\nSeamus Leheny \u2013 Policy Manager, Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland (BBC TV via Twitter):\n\n\u201cPeople forget what we make in Northern Ireland\u2026 70% of the cross-border freight here in Northern Ireland with the Republic, it\u2019s ingredients and components\u2026. Great Britain is a huge market for Northern Ireland, but we simply won\u2019t be able to make those products any more if there\u2019s tariffs or regulatory barriers with trade across the border.\u201d\n\nRead more: 'Unconvinced': How has Europe reacted to the UK's Brexit proposals?\n\nThe Irish government and European Union leaders contest the Johnson plan, fearing it would bring a hard border in Ireland and threaten the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe British government says the UK will leave the EU on October 31, although parliament has legislated for a delay should no deal be agreed.\n\nRead more:\n\nIreland unveils \u20ac1.2 billion fund to counter impact of no-deal Brexit\n\nUK adviser Shanker Singham: 'EU must compromise' on Irish customs\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?", "description": "Many traders are highly critical of the UK PM\u2019s proposals to replace the Irish border backstop.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/88/12/1000x563_cmsv2_f1f0a94e-76a9-5e45-bc0f-d0a298c9e9fa-4218812.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
