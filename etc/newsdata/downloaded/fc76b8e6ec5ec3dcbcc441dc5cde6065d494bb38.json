Proposals to fund Medicare for All have focused on raising taxes. But what if we could imagine another way entirely?\n\nOver 18 years, the United States has spent $4.9 trillion on wars, with only more intractable violence in the Middle East and beyond to show for it. That\u2019s nearly the $300 billion per year over the current system that is estimated to cover Medicare for All (though estimates vary).\n\nWhile we can\u2019t un-spend that $4.9 trillion, imagine if we could make different choices for the next 20 years.\n\nWe\u2019ve identified more than $300 billion in annual military savings alone that we could better invest in priorities like Medicare for All, working with a national grassroots movement called Poor People\u2019s Campaign.\n\nCutting military spending this way presents its own tremendous obstacles. Yet the exercise, however aspirational it may seem, also shows how ambitious proposals are still within reach \u2014 if we make different choices.\n\nTame the American War Machine\n\nThe $4.9 trillion we\u2019ve spent on wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and elsewhere grows to $5.9 trillion once we add in future care for veterans of those wars. That\u2019s more money than the G.D.P. of every country in the world other than the United States and China.\n\nThese are unwinnable wars. After nearly 18 years in Afghanistan, the Taliban now \u201ccontrols or contests\u201d more Afghan territory than at any time since before the invasion. One Army study of the Iraq war noted that \u201can emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor\u201d of the U.S.-launched war there.\n\nDespite the obvious downsides, Pentagon officials first requested $165 billion in war funds for 2020, although even they admit that only $66 billion of that is actually related to fighting wars \u2014 the rest covers regular operations.\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t just shell out for our own military \u2014 we pay significant sums for foreign militaries, too. The $14 billion provided to foreign militaries in 2017 is more than five times the budget of the United Nations.\n\nBring the Troops Home\n\nWith more than 800 bases and installations in more than 90 countries, our military is ready to step into any conflict at any time, and often that\u2019s just what it does. Our bases in Germany, established after World War II, serve as a launchpad for missions in the Middle East and Africa, where the U.S. has quietly been escalating its presence for years.\n\nThat\u2019s a terrible model. Just imagine if the U.S. still had thousands of troops in Afghanistan in 2076.\n\nOur overseas bases come with all sorts of costs. Just shipping private vehicles overseas for military personnel costs around $200 million each year. In the context of the $716 billion military budget, that doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it\u2019s 50 percent more than the U.S. spent on international disaster prevention and preparedness in 2017.\n\nClosing half or more of our foreign bases could actually enhance our national security by defusing unnecessary tensions and discouraging ill-thought-out interventions. And it would raise about $90 billion for things like Medicare for All. What are we doing with that base in Aruba, anyway?\n\nBanish Nuclear Weapons (or at Least Scrap the Trillion-Dollar Upgrade)\n\nThe United Nations has called for nuclear disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and at least 70 countries have signed on to a total nuclear weapons ban. The U.S. agreed to negotiate nuclear disarmament in the Non-Proliferation Treaty, though it has failed to follow through on that commitment.\n\nThe U.S. now has 4,000 deployed or stockpiled nuclear weapons, plus 2,500 more retired weapons awaiting dismantling. Our nuclear stockpile amounts to almost half the world total of 15,000.\n\nA total nuclear weapons ban would mean new treaties and would take years to negotiate. But if we could get there, we could save roughly $43 billion each year on weapons, delivery systems and upgrades, according to calculations based on data from the Department of Defense, the Congressional Budget Office and the Department of Energy. That\u2019s roughly the same amount we\u2019ve allocated in federal hurricane aid for Puerto Rico. Even canceling current plans for nuclear modernization and simply continuing on our current path could save about $20 billion per year.\n\nNext: Cut the Bloat and the Pork\n\nPrivate contractors consumed fully half the Pentagon budget in 2018, raking in more than $364 billion.\n\nThe F-35 jet fighter is a prime example. Over its lifetime, the F-35 is estimated to cost $1.5 trillion \u2014 more than the G.D.P. of Australia.\n\nThis is a plane with more than 900 performance deficiencies, according to a recent government report. Among the problems is a dangerous night vision defect in the plane\u2019s high-tech pilot\u2019s helmet, which costs $400,000, four times more than a typical helmet for other fighters, like the F-16.\n\nLike so many weapons programs, the F-35 program is a congressional darling, but not because of military necessity. A group of more than 100 members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter calling for the purchase of 24 more F-35s than the 79 that President Trump has already called for. With parts of the F-35 manufactured or assembled in 350 congressional districts, it\u2019s no mystery what is driving the enthusiasm for the plane.\n\nOur proposed cuts to production and operation of the F-35 total $14.7 billion \u2014 more than the military budget of Iran.\n\nVanity Boondoggles: The Space Force and the Wall\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s border wall has been estimated to cost as much as $25 billion. The sum budgeted for this year alone, at $9 billion, is more than the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency. Rather than using this money to build a wall for a nonexistent emergency, why not put it toward Medicare for All?\n\nLikewise, the planned Space Force is a novelty that the administration first promoted with a logo bearing the phrase \u201cMars Awaits.\u201d While military spending related to Mars is currently unknown, the $400 million that the administration has requested for its Space Force is a down payment for a project that would quickly reach many billions of dollars.\n\nThings That Would Run Better Outside the Military\n\nUnder Medicare for All, we would no longer need a separate Pentagon system to provide health care for troops and their families. This now costs $33 billion a year. This item takes us well past our goal of saving $300 billion.\n\nHundreds of thousands of active-duty military members are also assigned administrative jobs that could be done by civilians at lower cost. Transferring just one-quarter of those jobs to civilians could conservatively save $3 billion, enough to cover the current value of Affordable Care Act tax credits for health premiums in 46 states (but not Florida, California, Texas and North Carolina).\n\nPutting Titanic Savings to Good Use\n\nMany military experts are likely to disagree with some or even all of these options. And no doubt there are other equally sensible options for cutting military spending. (Our cuts total $2,807 for every American household.)\n\nRemaking our military as a truly defense-based institution, rather than a war machine and A.T.M. for private contractors, will require major changes. It\u2019s a project that can\u2019t happen overnight, and it will need serious planning and wiser uses of some of our $50 billion surplus to ensure both U.S. security and that people leaving military service find new jobs in our economy. That\u2019s no excuse for continuing to spend hundreds of billions in ways that make our world more dangerous and deny us the ability to seriously invest in things like jobs, health care, education and all that makes our lives better.", "description": "We can find billions of dollars to pay for universal health care if we look in the right places.", "authors": ["Lindsay Koshgarian"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/opinion/medicare-for-all-funding-military-1571081722487/medicare-for-all-funding-military-1571081722487-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
