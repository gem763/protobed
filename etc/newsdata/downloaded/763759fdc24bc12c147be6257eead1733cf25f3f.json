Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.\n\nShocked by her stunning defeat at the hands of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race, Clinton and her supporters \u2013 including most of the media \u2013 concocted a Russia collusion hoax to explain Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nKARL ROVE TO HILLARY CLINTON: 'PUT UP OR SHUT UP' ON TULSI GABBARD ACCUSATIONS\n\nNow \u2013 pulling from the same discredited playbook \u2013 Clinton is imagining that those crafty Ruskies are working to help Trump get reelected by getting Gabbard to run as a third-party presidential candidate and pull votes from whoever the Democrats nominate to run against Trump next year.\n\n\u201cI'm not making any predictions but I think they've [the Russians] got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said, in a clear reference to Gabbard. \u201cShe's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nAnd then, for good measure, Clinton said that 2016 third-party presidential candidate Jill Stein was also \u201ca Russian asset.\u201d Clinton supporters have blamed Stein for keeping Clinton out of the Oval Office by taking votes away from her.\n\nTULSI GABBARD BLASTS HILLARY CLINTON AFTER RUSSIAN ASSET COMMENTS: 'I STAND AGAINST EVERYTHING SHE REPRESENTS'\n\nNever mind that Special Counsel Robert Mueller discredited the crazy Russia hoax and cleared Trump and his campaign of collusion with Russia after spending two years and millions of taxpayer dollars on a needless witch hunt. Clinton still can\u2019t bring herself to believe that Trump won because he was the better candidate \u2013 she thinks it must have been the Russians who put him in the White House.\n\nAnd now, according to Clinton\u2019s new conspiracy theory, the Russians are working to keep Trump in the White House by turning Gabbard into the Jill Stein of 2020.\n\nGabbard tweeted in response: \"Thank you, Hillary Clinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. ... It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\"\n\nAt her second presidential debate against Trump in 2016, Clinton said that \u201cat some point we need to get the facts out.\u201d OK, so now is a good time for the former secretary of state, senator and first lady to come forward with whatever facts she has about Gabbard and Stein working with the Russians (Stein also denies the accusation).\n\nWhy Clinton would choose to attack Gabbard of all the presidential candidates doesn\u2019t make any sense. After all, Gabbard is polling at just 1.2 percent according to the latest public survey averages \u2013 and is now getting an enormous amount of free publicity because of the Clinton attack.\n\nBut that\u2019s beside the point; Clinton has made a very serious charge that deserves scrutiny by the free press.\n\nThe mainstream media should demand Clinton answer questions, starting with what information she has to support her accusation about Gabbard, a combat war veteran and a major in the Army National Guard.\n\nLet\u2019s remember that Clinton still owes the American people answers about her own presidential campaign\u2019s payments to a law firm that funneled money to ex-British spy Christopher Steele to collude with Russians to fabricate dirt on presidential candidate Trump.\n\nI think everyone would like to know what Clinton knows about Steele\u2019s activities in working with senior Obama administration officials to smear and frame candidate Trump.\n\nThe former secretary of state might also shed some light on Ukraine\u2019s anti-Trump activities in 2016, since her ally \u2013 Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. \u2013 has made that nation the focus of his witch hunt du jour in the impeachment crusade now underway by desperate Democrats against President Trump.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s words are supposed to carry weight. She has made a charge that the Russians are meddling in the 2020 presidential election. If her statement wasn\u2019t so batty, it should probably trigger an investigation \u2013 maybe another special counsel.\n\nPerhaps some of Clinton\u2019s former donors and supporters on Robert Mueller\u2019s team are available to look into the new nutty allegations. I\u2019m sure political operatives in her stable are willing to dig into it as well and spend hours on MSNBC and CNN discussing made-up Russian attacks on Gabbard and whoever the Democrats nominate to run against Trump.\n\nThese must be sad days for Hillary Clinton. She\u2019s been reduced to lobbing unhinged conspiracy theory grenades into a primary election contest that she won't enter because she can\u2019t win.\n\nClinton obviously still can\u2019t get over losing the 2016 race to Donald Trump; the race that was supposed to be a can't-miss victory. She was supposed to crack the hardest and highest glass ceiling and become the first woman president in American history. This was her destiny and claim to eternal fame and glory \u2013 until Trump came along.\n\nClinton\u2019s inability to rise to the occasion in her race against Trump \u2013 as President George H.W. Bush was able to do when he lost to her husband Bill Clinton in 1992 \u2013 is taking its toll on our grand republic. Hillary continues to selfishly divide our nation. It\u2019s time for the mainstream media and any responsible power brokers on the left to tell her to knock it off once and for all.\n\nThe day after her humiliating and clearly traumatic election defeat to Trump, Hillary Clinton tweeted: \u201cto all the little girls watching\u2026never doubt that you are valuable and powerful & deserving of every chance & opportunity in the world.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nApparently these words don\u2019t apply to Tulsi Gabbard. Clinton\u2019s longtime insistence that she\u2019s essentially the world\u2019s greatest advocate for women makes her attack on Gabbard that much more outlandish.\n\nSince the day Trump was elected president, Clinton and her Resistance supporters have worked tirelessly to discredit and delegitimize the duly elected president and ultimate political outsider. It hasn\u2019t worked, because this president is as tough as nails and is laser-focused on his job \u2013\n\nFirst to Make America Great Again and now to Keep America Great.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton wants to be relevant and remain in the public debate, she shouldn\u2019t\u2019 lurk in the shadows and throw bombs at her political enemies. It\u2019s time for Hillary Clinton to come forward and face the music.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGabbard was right to challenge Clinton to \u201cjoin the race directly.\u201d\n\nMadam Secretary, are you in or out? I\u2019m sure the twice-failed presidential candidate is contemplating this question as we speak. She might not like the reality. The reality is that most Americans want her to take a very long and very restful walk in the woods and just go away. Far, far away.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAVID BOSSIE", "description": "Hillary Clinton is imagining the Russians are working to help President Trump get reelected by getting Tulsi Gabbard to run as a third-party presidential candidate.", "authors": ["David Bossie", "David N.
