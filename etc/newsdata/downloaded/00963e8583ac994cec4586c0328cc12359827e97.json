But we\u2019re failing autistic people\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "All different types of brains are normal, but greater understanding has not led to more money for autism, says world-leading expert\n\nAs a graduate in the 1980s, Simon Baron\u2011Cohen taught autistic children at a special school in London. Little was known about autism then, and people often misheard him, assuming he taught \u201cartistic children\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople would be ashamed if they had an autistic child, or ashamed of saying, \u2018I am autistic\u2019, whereas now it\u2019s treated as more ordinary and there\u2019s less judgment,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the 1980s, autism was seen as categorical, so \u2018you either have it or you don\u2019t\u2019 \u2026 nowadays, we talk about a spectrum.\u201d\n\nToday, Baron-Cohen, 61, is a world expert on autism, a Cambridge professor and director of the university\u2019s influential Autism Research Centre. There is also greater awareness of autism, a lifelong condition affecting how people interact or process information.\n\nMaybe because I had a sister with a disability I was already sensitised to and fascinated by people who think or develop differently\n\nEstimates suggest one in every 100 people is on the autism spectrum (700,000 adults and children), from those with severe developmental disabilities needing intense support, to those with milder traits. Well-known autistic people include campaigner Greta Thunberg (who calls her \u201cdifference\u201d a superpower). As a cognitive neuroscientist, Baron-Cohen has helped focus attention, from his pioneering psychological studies (autism was first diagnosed in the 1960s in the UK) to founding the UK\u2019s first diagnosis clinic in Cambridge 20 years ago with charitable funding (today the centre is NHS-run).\n\nYet his latest research reflects how improved awareness and understanding of autism have not led to improvements in the lives of people with autism. In the studyexploring how autistic adults experience disproportionately more \u201cnegative life events\u201d, 45% of the 426 participants say they often lack money to meet basic needs (compared with 25% of non-autistic people) and 20% have been sexually abused by a partner (compared with 9%). The research, involving questionnaires created with autistic people, suggests why those with autism may experience more depression.\n\nThese findings add more weight to existing evidence about the significant challenges facing autistic people. Diagnosis can take years; children face cuts to special educational needs provision; just 16% of autistic people had jobs in 2016 (compared with 80% of non-autistic people); and they are among those locked up in secure hospital-style units instead of living in communities. The Autism Act a decade ago obliged the government to create a strategy to improve support, but legislation has fallen short of promises.\n\n\u201cMany autistic people and their families will tell you that while the [government\u2019s] autism strategy has raised awareness, nothing much has changed on the ground in the last 10 years. And, despite our research flagging up suicide risk and other kinds of vulnerability, too many autistic people are languishing unsupported because there\u2019s no new money in social care for autism. This is unacceptable,\u201d says Baron-Cohen.\n\nHe hopes his centre\u2019s recent findings will encourage better practical help, such as a lifelong support worker, \u201cso there\u2019s a pathway from discovery in the lab through to changing people\u2019s lives\u201d.He says: \u201cThe old style of doing research was, without [us] realising it, arrogant, in that the scientists thought up the questions and then did it. The new way is to involve people from the outset \u2026 to codesign the studies, and check the relevance and wording.\u201d Gaps between research and practice influenced plans for a \u00a335m Autism Centre of Excellence by 2025. Aiming to be the UK\u2019s first national clinical and research centre for autistic people, it will combine academic expertise with practical help. In theory, children or adults referred by a GP would get a diagnosis, then immediate support from specialists like psychiatrists, employment or benefits advisers. \u201cLocally, we\u2019ve got this research centre and world-famous university, and all around it people are sitting on waiting lists, unable to be seen, and they\u2019re struggling, so it\u2019s about closing that gap,\u201d he explains.\n\nWomen 'better than men at disguising autism symptoms' Read more\n\nBaron-Cohen\u2019s late sister, Suzie, had severe learning disabilities. She was sent to an institution aged two (common advice from doctors at the time). Later in life, he moved her to supported housing near his own home. She died in 2014. In an emotive eulogy, he recalled of his sister: \u201cOur lives were richer for having shared the journey with her.\u201d He talks movingly of her and how she influenced his work. \u201cMaybe because I had a sister with a disability I was already sensitised to and fascinated by people who think or develop differently,\u201d he says.\n\nHe has won national and international awards for researching the biological, hormonal and genetic factors in autism. Yet Baron-Cohen\u2019s theories remain controversial. The extreme male brain concept, outlined in his provocative book, The Essential Difference, describes men\u2019s brains being wired for systemising and women\u2019s for empathising. This led to criticisms of \u201cneurosexism\u201d and gender stereotyping, which could risk misdiagnosing or underdiagnosing autistic women, and also of fuelling the idea that people with autism have no cognitive empathy. In his defence, he stresses that \u201cequality between the sexes is very important\u201d, adding that his research explores groups of males and females \u201con average\u201d, adding \u201cthis is not about individuals\u201d. With empathy, he argues that while autistic people may struggle to imagine others\u2019 emotions, they feel emotion if others are upset (the distinction between cognitive and affective empathy).\n\nIn future, he hopes the idea of neurodiversity becomes more mainstream. \u201cBrains come in different types and they\u2019re all normal,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we want is that one day every workplace will be diverse \u2013 we already encourage that with gender and ethnicity, but the next frontier is neurodiversity and it will become ordinary. People won\u2019t think twice about it.\u201d\n\nCurriculum vitae\n\nAge: 61.\n\nLives: Cambridge.\n\nFamily: Widowed, three adult children.\n\nEducation: Haberdashers\u2019 Aske\u2019s school, Hertfordshire; New College, University of Oxford (BA human sciences); University College London (PhD in psychology); Institute of Psychiatry, London (MPhil, clinical psychology).\n\nCareer: 1995-present: director, Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge; 1994-present: teaching fellow then professorial fellow in experimental psychology, Trinity College, Cambridge; 1994-present: lecturer then reader then professor in developmental cognitive neuroscience, departments of psychiatry and psychology, Cambridge; 1988-93: lecturer then senior lecturer in developmental psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, London; 1987-88: lecturer, department of psychology, University College London.\n\nPublic life: Vice-president, National Autistic Society; trustee, Autism Research Trust; trustee, Empathy for Peace; president, International Society for Autism Research (2017-19); chair of psychology section, British Academy (2016-19).\n\nAwards and honours: Fellow, Academy of Medical Sciences; fellow, British Academy; Distinguished Contributions award, developmental psychology section, British Psychology Society.\n\nInterests: Plays bass guitar in Deep Blue, a Cambridge soul and blues band.", "description": "Brains come in different types and they\u2019re all normal, but greater understanding has not led to more money for autism, says expert", "authors": ["Saba Salman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04b1e0f69f91bb618a6e6c8fb9aaeea3b779a46/0_204_5976_3584/master/5976.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3707c0cc971f0a61818a00a6b940f27c"}
