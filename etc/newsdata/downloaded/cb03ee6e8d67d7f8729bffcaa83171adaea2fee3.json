I am expecting\u2026 abs.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018I am single and I am expecting some abs soon if I keep working for them. The ideal guy for me is someone\u2026 it sounds clich\u00e9 but someone who\u2019s driven, someone who\u2019s passionate, someone that wants to be the best at what they do, someone that is intelligent.\n\n\u2018I cannot stand not being able to have a conversation with someone, and that\u2019s the case with a lot of these guys out here. They do not know how to hold a conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not trying to waste my time. A great sense of humour and some style would be nice too. The list could go on and on but I\u2019m not picky.\u2019\n\nJordyn made the bizarre comments during a Q&A with her little sister (Picture: YouTube/ Jordyn Woods)\n\nHer bizarre answer to that question comes nine months after she was accused of kissing Khloe Kardashian\u2019s baby daddy, Tristan Thompson, which effectively ended the couple\u2019s relationship.\n\nThe 22-year-old was then forced to move out of Kylie\u2019s home, where she had been living until then and caused Kylie to cut ties with her former bestie.\n\nShe spoke out to deny the claims on Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s Red Table Talk series, but it wasn\u2019t enough to build bridges with the Kardashian-Jenner family once again.\n\nJordyn launched her YouTube channel last week, and has already amassed over 123,000 subscribers who are no doubt waiting to hear more about the drama in a tell-all vlog.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
