How should the New Orleans Saints handle their quarterback situation going forward?\n\nStart savvy veteran Teddy Bridgewater? Or, turn to the exciting, multifaceted Taysom Hill?\n\nIt has been a topic of discussion all week of whether it\u2019ll be Teddy or Taysom on Sunday when the Saints face the Seattle Seahawks. Except once place: the Saints\u2018 locker room.\n\n\u201cI would say Teddy and Taysom - no versus,\u201d offensive lineman Terron Armstead said.\n\nNew Orleans coach Sean Payton declined to name a starter this week after Brees underwent surgery Wednesday in Los Angeles to repair an injured ligament near his right thumb. The surgery will keep Brees out for several weeks.\n\nMost assume Bridgewater will start, including many of his teammates. The 26-year-old quarterback has a proven track record after starting 28 games for Minnesota in 2014-15, leading the Vikings to a playoff appearance.\n\nBut Payton\u2019s unwillingness to name a starter is viewed as more than just tactical. There\u2019s a firm belief on the team that Hill will have a significant role as well, forcing the Seahawks to spend time preparing for two players.\n\n\u201cDrew Brees is incredible, but there\u2019s not much of a drop off with the talent Teddy and Taysom bring,\u201d wide receiver Austin Carr said. \u201cAs a receiver, obviously you appreciate that and you\u2019re excited. You don\u2019t run your routes any slower or any less hard.\u201d\n\nFor Bridgewater, this could be quite the comeback story.\n\nThe first-round pick out of Louisville was a rising young star already with a playoff appearance when a catastrophic knee injury during 2016 training camp wiped out most of his last two years with the Vikings. After a stint with the New York Jets last spring and summer, he was traded to New Orleans.\n\nHe turned down the opportunity to start elsewhere to return to the Saints in the offseason and be the backup to Brees. It was a bit of a gamble that could pay off. And he understands the significance, noting this will be the first meaningful playing time he has had since 2015. Not only is New Orleans\u2018 season at stake, but how he performs will affect his future.\n\n\u201cA lot of people I think forget what he did when he was a starter in this league,\u201d running back Alvin Kamara said. \u201cTeddy has rank in this league.\u201d\n\nHill is building a similar reputation.\n\nA multi-position player who has lined up in at least seven positions on offense and special teams, he has his own comeback story. A starter at BYU, Hill suffered a Lisfranc fracture in his foot as a senior and missed the rest of the season. He was granted a redshirt and awarded a fifth season, but a hyperextended elbow ended that campaign early as well.\n\nUndrafted in 2017, he was signed and waived at the end of the preseason by Green Bay. The Saints quickly signed him and he has become a favorite among his teammates and fans because of his versatility. He has lined up at quarterback three times this season and it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll do so again against the Seahawks.\n\n\u201cTaysom came and made a name for himself just by being who he is, and that\u2019s a football player,\u201d Armstead said. \u201cWherever you need him, whatever he\u2019s called to do, he does it 110%. He\u2019s an X-factor in a lot of ways. I could point to last year where he was the spark that got us going. Struggle, struggle, Taysom made a play and we took off.\n\n\u201cTaysom is a guy who can create a spark.\u201d\n\nNot many teams have the luxury of two viable backups.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got three starting quarterbacks, and it\u2019s a credit to our front office,\u201d Armstead notes.\n\nAnd most teams would never consider playing both. But there seems to be enough harmony in New Orleans\u2018 locker room to allow peaceful cohabitation.\n\n\u201cI love Teddy,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI think from the second he got here last year through this year, we\u2019ve become friends. I think our QB room is really close, so I\u2019m rooting for him and I know Teddy\u2019s rooting for me. And we were there to support Drew when he was the guy. So that mindset is no different.\n\n\u201cAnd I think we both have the same role, and that\u2019s to win football games.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The debate started once Drew Brees went down last Sunday.
