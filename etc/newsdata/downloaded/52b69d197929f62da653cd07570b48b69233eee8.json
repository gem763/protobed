Two economists who conducted a study of Environmental Protection Agency data found that particulate matter air pollution dropped 24 percent in the U.S. from 2009 to 2016 but increased 5.5 percent the next two years, which correlated with thousands of premature deaths.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat increase was associated with 9,700 premature deaths in 2018,\u201d Karen Clay and Nicholas Muller, economists with Carnegie Mellon, wrote in a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the deaths represent $89 billion worth in damages.\n\nClay and Muller attributed the rise in air pollution to a recent stronger economy, a rise in wildfires and weakened federal \u201cclean air\u201d rules, according to an expanded version of the paper reviewed by CBS News.\n\nThe researchers found that a rise in economic activity has led to more trucks and other pollution-emitting vehicles on the roads along with a rise in manufacturers' carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cThe chemical composition of particulates point to increased use of natural gas and to vehicle miles traveled as likely contributors to the increase\u201d in pollution, they wrote. \u201cWe conclude that the effect is due to diesel vehicles as well as some industrial boilers.\u201d\n\nClay and Muller also said an increase in wildfires in the West since 2016 could be linked to a rise in airborne carbon particles.\n\n\u201cBecause of these large increases and the large exposed population in California, we find that nearly 43% of the increase in deaths nationally from 2016 to 2018 occurred in California,\u201d they said.\n\nAccording to government data, wildfires release high amounts of carbon dioxide and other damaging chemicals into the atmosphere as well as pollutants that are harmful to humans.\n\nLastly, Clay and Muller cited a decline in federal enforcement of the Clean Air Act as one cause of decreased air quality. The Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group, credits the 1970 law with preventing hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and hundreds of millions of cases of respiratory and heart disease.", "description": "As the U.S.\u00a0economy has grown, the\u00a0gains have coincided with a reverse in improvements in the nation's air quality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/smog_pollution_121411getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
