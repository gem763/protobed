What invisible connections will be made, and who will become a breakout star or a cult favorite. Halfway through the year, we\u2019ve had exciting new music from indie veterans, career-best (so far) music from bubbling stars, and much more. It\u2019s still too early to define the sounds of 2019, but if you\u2019re looking for music made by people in search of hard truths or bliss or some wild combination of both, the songs below will have you covered.\n\n\u201cFlat Tummy Tea,\u201d Freddie Gibbs and Madlib\n\nFreddie Gibbs is one of the more consistent rappers we\u2019ve got. His voice sits low and his throat sounds like it\u2019s been raked over gravel a few too many times. He\u2019s cynical, but not completely cut off from relatable concepts like love and jokes and the ridiculousness of life. He is a technical master, and that\u2019s why he works so well with Madlib, a producer who thrives on sloppily chopped, obscure samples that sometimes have so much going on that the rapping that is happening over the top of them is beside the point. \u201cFlat Tummy Tea\u201d sees the duo returning after 2014\u2019s very good Pinata. It\u2019d be easy to just run through a litany of highlights: Freddie Gibbs experimenting with a double-time flow, the beat switch halfway through, the density of the track that makes it feel like it\u2019s ten minutes longer than it actually is (and that length would be welcome), but instead it\u2019s just worth saying that \u201cFlat Tummy Tea\u201d is, in a sense, the reason all of us love rap. Even if you don\u2019t love this song, that swagger and confidence is the backbone of the whole thing. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\n\u201cHow Did I Get Here,\u201d Offset and J. Cole\n\nThe world did not really need solo albums from each Migos member, but the world doesn\u2019t need a lot of things it\u2019s getting right now, so here we are. This is, however, a list of the best songs of 2019 so far, and that means that we actually did need \u201cHow Did I Get Here,\u201d from Offset\u2019s way better than it needs to be solo album. On it, the rapper hops nimbly over a spaced-out beat, seemingly bewildered by his lot in life, running through it all in elliptical sentence fragments: \u201cWakin\u2019 up to see the sunrise / I turned five, I got baptized / We was livin\u2019 up in College Park / Midnight, heard the gunfight / Playin\u2019 football at Forest Park / Gresham Park where your moment get defined / The story of my life / Way before I ever wrote a rhyme / Have you ever done time? / Lookin\u2019 at my kids through the blinds / Confinement mind / How you feelin\u2019 when you face a dime?\u201d It\u2019s notable for its economy, but before you can fully absorb it, J. Cole drops in for a whirlwind of a guest verse. \u2014S.H.-S.\n\n\u201cMeet Again,\u201d Maxo Kream\n\nSometimes you just hear a song and can only think, Now there\u2019s a guy who\u2019s seen some shit. That\u2019s Maxo Kream\u2019s \u201cMeet Again.\u201d In a few short years, the Houston rapper has quickly demonstrated a distinct handle on the fundamentals of rap storytelling. \u201cMeet Again\u201d gives those meeting Kream for the first time his autobiography via detailed excerpts from letters to an incarcerated friend about all the life passing him by on the outside. His updates range from the comically rude (\u201cI seen your stupid baby momma, she still actin\u2019 like a thot\u201d) to the soul-crushing (\u201cYou can\u2019t be there like a father and it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 with you mentally\u201d). Kream tells it to him straight: Everyone they know \u2014 Kream included \u2014 is becoming a casualty of the system. Not a word of it is fiction. Just last December, in one clean sweep, 20 of his friends were arrested in connection with one of his music videos. The sad truth is, for Kream, they\u2019re just another 20 people he\u2019ll now have to write. \u2014Dee Lockett\n\n\u201cSaturdays (Again),\u201d Avey Tare\n\nQuick question: Where does your mind go when I say that this song sounds sort of like the Gipsy Kings? If that turns you off, I get it. Gipsy Kings have their positives, but they also bring to mind that vague connotation of \u201cworld music,\u201d which is mostly defined not by the fact that it is music of the world (though it is), but because it\u2019s music that can be lumped into an unfortunate catchall and be sold, at, like, Whole Foods. (Does Whole Foods still sell CDs? They used to!) But I digress. \u201cSaturdays (Again),\u201d by Animal Collective\u2019s Avey Tare is a gorgeous, syrupy psychedelic track that recalls, yeah, the Gipsy Kings, but is also reminiscent of Campfire Songs\u2013era Animal Collective. If you don\u2019t know about that album, it was improvised and recorded on a bunch of MiniDisc players (remember those?) on a screened-in porch in Maryland. This wasn\u2019t recorded on that porch, but no one\u2019s stopping you from heading to the nearest porch and blasting it until it feels like it was. \u2014S.H.-S.\n\n\u201cSleepwalkin,\u2019\u201d Better Oblivion Community Center\n\nBetter Oblivion Community Center is the project of Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers. The former is a veteran of bummer songs about love and loneliness, the other is newer but no less adept at plumbing the depths of human emotion, only she does it with a perpetual smirk that doesn\u2019t so much obliterate the heaviness of what she\u2019s singing about as it does make it feel more real. \u201cSleepwalkin\u2019\u201d sees Oberst and Bridgers trading verses before building to what I imagine will become a signature lyrical moment for both of them: \u201cIs this having fun? It\u2019s not like the way it was.\u201d The question mark I typed is grammatically correct, but it doesn\u2019t quite catch the quavering flatness that the pair uses in that moment. It feels more like a period. You know that they already know the answer to a question that doesn\u2019t really need to be asked. \u2014S.H.-S.\n\n\u201cThotiana (Remix),\u201d Blueface ft. Cardi B\n\nLike any popular rap song, there are plenty of remixes to choose from here. Maybe you\u2019d prefer the one with YG, or the maybe unofficial one with Tyga, or whatever \u201cThotiana Remix ft. Disney\u2019s Goofy (PARODY)\u201d is supposed to be. They all have their positives (maybe not the Goofy one), but I\u2019m going with Cardi B\u2019s contribution to Blueface\u2019s wan (in a good way!), hypnotic (also in a good way!), and disorienting (still in a good way!) \u201cThotiana,\u201d a song that sounds like it was made in a hot car with all the windows rolled up at 5 p.m. on a blazing summer day. It\u2019s intangible, barely there, and you\u2019ll be confused about why you keep coming back to it. Blueface is onto something. \u2014S.H.-S.\n\nSolange ft. Playboi Carti, \u201cAlmeda\u201d\n\nWhat makes Solange so distinctly Solange is her effortless ability to cull freedom from any form of entrapment. Looking at the way black people have increasingly been snuffed out of black culture for the purposes of commodification, for example, she can still offer hope by snatching back the pride in our ownership. \u201cAlmeda,\u201d a song off of her excellent latest, When I Get Home, extends the message of A Seat at the Table\u2019s \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d and lists as gospel the rich qualities of blackness (be it our liquor of choice or the versatility of our hair) that make us us, which can never believably be chopped and screwed by any other culture (unlike the song\u2019s beat, an homage to her Houston rap roots). Hunter Harris said it best: \u201c\u2018Almeda\u2019 plays with a special alchemy of everything that feels banal, but special. Brown skin, black braids, brown liquor \u2014 sip, sip, sip.\u201d \u2014D.L.\n\nLizzo, \u201cSoulmate\u201d\n\nWell, I\u2019ve never made a single song in my life, so who am I to say Lizzo\u2019s \u201cSoulmate\u201d is one of the best songs of the year? I don\u2019t know, man, sometimes facts are facts. Lizzo gets a lot of praise and, suddenly, now more and more flak for her very specific branding of self-love. But she only does it because (a) she does it so well she oughta patent the phrase, and (b) because sometimes this shit\u2019s deeper than an Instagram feed. For Lizzo, loving herself is what keeps her alive and fulfilled. Loving herself is what got her this far and if it\u2019s carried her to this level of fame, why wouldn\u2019t she preach that gospel to uplift anyone else who needs to hear it? This is the best lyric I\u2019ve heard all year and I will repeat it to myself in the mirror every day: \u201cTrue love ain\u2019t something you can buy yourself / True love finally happens when you by yourself / So if you by yourself, then go and buy yourself another round from the bottle on the higher shelf.\u201d \u201cSoulmate\u201d is not a song about not wanting anyone else; it\u2019s about not needing anyone but yourself. \u2014D.L.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9, \u201cSorry \u2013 Original Demo\u201d\n\nSo rarely do artists let us see their raw emotions in real time, when the wounds are still fresh, exposed, and hemorrhaging. Beyonc\u00e9 was a mentally battered woman on Lemonade, and it took guts to admit those feelings of defeat she suffered in such a public way; it also took time and a lot of clarity, being removed from the pain and having reached a resolution. It makes the vitriol and spite on the version of \u201cSorry\u201d we\u2019ve known for three years now seem performative \u2014 though still very much rooted in genuine disgust \u2014 in comparison to its original demo, which she\u2019s now shared with Lemonade\u2019s wider streaming release. The Beyonc\u00e9 we hear on the OG \u201cSorry\u201d didn\u2019t have the emotional wherewithal to spit snappy one-liners for IG captions (you won\u2019t find \u201csuck on my balls, pause\u201d or \u201cboy bye\u201d). Her snarling \u201chell nah\u201d is just a meager \u201chell no\u201d here. There\u2019s no sheen on the production yet either, just placeholder synths. Bey sounds spent, but also more in touch with her humanity in this stream-of-consciousness, spoken-word approach (\u201ctryna keep my family right\u201d just kills). She\u2019s showing open nerve endings; showing how she processes and creates spectacular art out of spectacular trauma; and also showing, once again, that she works damn hard at perfecting her craft. Neither version is superior to the other. They merely represent Beyonc\u00e9 at different stages of grief. \u2014D.L.\n\nTyler, the Creator, \u201cEarfquake\u201d\n\nTyler, the Creator is at his best when he\u2019s exploring the ways in which romantic relationships, at their peaks and valleys, can feel like personal natural disasters, and how you can never really know which end of that stability spectrum you\u2019re at because it all kind of starts to feel the same over time. That early days rush you get when you realize that you might\u2019ve found a good thing is the same as the one you get when they stick around despite the inevitable bullshit that\u2019ll come with the territory of emotional intimacy. In fact, it\u2019s more potent because now there\u2019s dependency on the rush \u2014 and you will always crave more, do anything to maintain it. \u201cEarfquake,\u201d off his brilliant IGOR, is a three-minute ride on that roller coaster. Tyler (with an assist from Uncle Charlie Wilson) croons about chasing after someone who only ever splits his heart into pieces. The person he\u2019s singing to seems to understand why this is a problem (\u201cRiding around, you\u2019re telling me something is bad\u201d), but Tyler ignores all the signs and blames himself. (Anything to find that rush again.) There was endless backlash at the beginning of Tyler\u2019s career over his preference for the grotesque, but, really, he\u2019s only now scratching the surface on the most horrific subject matter there is: love. \u2014D.L.\n\nJai Paul, \u201cDo You Love Her Now\u201d\n\nThe entitlement fans project onto artists over their work can be detrimental to the work. In some cases, like for the Rihannas of the world, the pressure to deliver on that \u201cgive it to me now\u201d deadline is easily silenced with a few snappy Instagram clap backs. But for smaller artists, the feeling that you owe your creativity to strangers is suffocating. It\u2019s what forced Jai Paul, the already enigmatic British singer-producer, further into hiding after he first caught the music-blog world\u2019s attention at the top of the decade, only to have a large chunk of his work leaked and presented as his debut album without his consent. (Imagine what that sort of betrayal might\u2019ve done to, say, Frank Ocean when it was still early days.) Six years later, Paul has returned to reclaim his work; he\u2019s officially released that album on his own terms and shared with it two previously unreleased songs, \u201cHe\u201d and the stunning \u201cDo You Love Her Now.\u201d The latter, a psychedelic burst that\u2019s equal parts rock ballad and jam session, reflects on missed opportunity, taking intimacy for granted, and setting boundaries and distance. He and Paul brothers collaborator Fabiana Palladino briefly sing back and forth, representing two sides of a romantic relationship that has frayed. But it\u2019s not hard to read a little more into it knowing what Paul\u2019s career endured. It\u2019s a lesson in the beauty that can come when we just let artists breathe. \u2014D.L.\n\nKaty Perry, \u201cNever Really Over\u201d\n\nThe wait for Katy Perry to get back down to the business of deliciously executed pop songs is over. After a seemingly never-ending series of missteps and steps back, her newest single \u201cNever Really Over\u201d re-centers the singer to the same sensibility that put her in the upper echelons of this generation of pop stars in the first place. It\u2019s a smart pairing with a proven hit-maker, Zedd, that plays to her strengths \u2014 world\u2019s better than their first collaboration at that \u2014 and the exact kind of artist-producer connection that you imagine she\u2019s been searching for post\u2013Dr. Luke. Zedd provides the finger snaps and synth swells but does the more important work of getting out of her way. It\u2019s Perry center stage doing what she does best: flipping downers of situations (a.k.a. heartbreak) into upbeat pop smashes. Welcome back, Katy. \u2014D.L.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 ft. Blue Ivy, Saint Jhn, and WizKid, \u201cBrown Skin Girl\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredible to think of this as an off year for Beyonc\u00e9, one where maybe she doesn\u2019t release a solo album. Because even in her relatively quieter times, she\u2019s prolific. This is already her second appearance on this list this year; the first was for a demo from the Lemonade sessions she shared with the album\u2019s wider streaming release earlier this year. She\u2019s also dropped the live album Homecoming for her Netflix movie about her legendary Coachella set; released a new merch line for her stans; and co-starred in the Lion King remake, for which she has, of course, gone the extra mile and made her own entire companion soundtrack. (Remaking the original music would be child\u2019s play.) Every song on it is a standout, really, but \u201cBrown Skin Girl\u201d is resonating so deeply with black women across the diaspora because it, like so much of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s work, was written exclusively for us. It intends to celebrate black beauty while reasserting the standards of who gets to be black and beautiful: \u201cThere\u2019s complexities in complexion,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 sings, and, later, \u201cYour skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story.\u201d Colorism exists to erase and strip the beauty from those with \u201ctoo much\u201d melanin. \u201cBrown Skin Girl\u201d exists to remind that we can never have enough. \u2014D.L.\n\nMiley Cyrus, \u201cSlide Away\u201d\n\nCyrus\u2019s \u201cSlide Away\u201d manages to feel quiet and intimate without any flatness. Producers Mike WiLL Made It and Andrew Wyatt mix hip-hop drums, warm guitars, sweeping strings, and layered samples as Miley eulogizes her marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth, a split made public mere days ago as rumors swirl that the singer is seeing Brody Jenner\u2019s ex Kaitlynn Carter. \u201cSlide Away\u201d isn\u2019t vindictive or tabloid-y. It\u2019s just about knowing when to cut your losses and move on. The music suits Miley\u2019s voice, pushing her without overwhelming her. The mix doesn\u2019t sound like anything else from this decade; this is the kind of record the gifted British singer-songwriters landed on at the end of the \u201990s, when everyone started jet-setting around genres and playing with samples. It\u2019s much more like Blur\u2019s \u201cTender\u201d or the Verve\u2019s \u201cBittersweet Symphony\u201d than anything on Bangers, Dead Petz, or Younger Now. It\u2019s a fitting end to a ten-year period of wild swings and big changes for Miley to find sturdy middle ground between jibing her interests and making a record that sounds like all of her, all at once. Time will tell. \u2014Craig Jenkins\n\nTaylor Swift ft. The Dixie Chicks, \u201cSoon You\u2019ll Get Better\u201d\n\nThe push and pull between Swift\u2019s expressions of strong yearnings and wounding realities has changed from the neat binaries (trueheartedness versus romantic betrayal; earnestness versus bullying) that populated her first few albums and, for some, grew tiresome. This time, on Lover, she\u2019s conveying a desperate feeling of helplessness to make everything okay and a youthful need for her loved one to reassure her by matching her relentless optimism, but she\u2019s also reflecting on the situation from a remove. \u201cI know delusion when I see it in the mirror,\u201d Swift sighs. \u201cYou like the nicer nurses / You make the best of a bad deal / I just pretend it isn\u2019t real.\u201d Maines, Maguire, and Robison help deepen the melancholy awareness. During the bridge, their harmonies crescendo around Swift in knowing denial. \u201cI hate to make this all about me,\u201d Swift begins. \u201cBut who am I supposed to talk to?\u201d they all protest. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do if there\u2019s no you?\u201d Swift, we now know, still connects with the confessional approach that laid the foundation for her country career, and even sees possibilities in it. \u2014Jewly Hight\n\nLana Del Rey, \u201cLooking for America\u201d\n\nToo often we\u2019ve been left shell-shocked and emotionally battered by this country\u2019s continued descent into terroristic gun-toting madness. This song, a pre-album loosie from Lana, won\u2019t put a stop to our collective tears. Which is fine. These are times to cry and mourn and feel the exhaustion, but to also channel the pain into action. Lana Del Rey took a flight back from Montecito, phoned her producer Jack Antonoff, and immediately hit the studio to process her feelings about the massacres in Dayton and El Paso. The result is \u201cLooking for America,\u201d continuing a streak of excellent songwriting from Lana. She typically has deep affection for the past, particularly as it relates to American iconography and patriotism, but \u201cLooking for America\u201d can\u2019t be nostalgic for an America that has never existed. This is a rare moment where Lana, as a voice of reason, is looking ahead: \u201cI\u2019m still looking for my own version of America / One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly.\u201d It\u2019s not what America was or is; Lana sees what America can be. I hope she\u2019s right. \u2014D.L.", "description": "Including a fresh perspective on an old Beyonc\u00e9 hit, Lizzo\u2019s self-love anthem, and more poignant words from Solange on black ownership.", "authors": ["Vulture Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/05/05-best-so-far-songs.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
