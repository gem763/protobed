The problem \u201ccould adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane and result in loss of control of the airplane,\u201d the FAA said.\n\nAD\n\nBoeing said its customers have completed 810 inspections so far, finding 38 cases that will \u201crequire repair and replacement of the affected parts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur technical team is working to determine the most efficient repair plan for customers that ensures the safety, quality and integrity of the airplane. We are investigating the root cause of the issue,\u201d Boeing said in a statement.\n\nBoeing said the cracking does not affect any of its 737 Max aircraft, which remain grounded after investigators said a flawed automated anti-stall system contributed to two deadly crashes within five months.\n\nThe FAA is working with Boeing and international aviation safety regulators \u201cto better understand the factors that led to the formation of the cracks\u201d in the 737 NG jets, the safety agency said. \u201cThe FAA will continue to monitor the situation and will consider additional action as necessary.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSouthwest said \u201cwe did not find abnormalities on the vast majority of our inspected fleet.\u201d The grounded aircraft \u201cwill remain out of our schedule until the issues have been fully resolved,\u201d the company said, and its technicians are \u201cnow focused on completing inspections of the remaining portion of the 737 NG fleet covered by the\u201d FAA order.\n\nAD\n\nInternationally, Brazilian low-cost airline GOL said it had grounded 11 planes after discovering cracks. It said it \u201cdeeply regrets any inconvenience\u201d caused to customers who had to be booked on other planes.\n\nBoeing said safety and quality are its top priorities.\n\n\u201cBoeing regrets the impact this issue is having on our 737NG customers worldwide,\u201d the company said.\n\nAD\n\nThe FAA inspection order is based on how many \u201ccycles\u201d a plane has experienced, meaning how many times it has gone through pressurization and depressurization. The FAA order had longer inspection deadlines for planes with fewer cycles.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t started formal inspections because they\u2019re not required\u201d immediately on the planes they have, American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said.\n\nUnited said its aircraft \u201cwill be inspected within the required time frame.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "After early inspections find problems, the FAA is trying \u201cto better understand the factors that led to the formation of the cracks.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael Laris", "Transportation Reporter"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=127", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
