Over that period her group of analysts, which hosts an average of three executive teams per day, has noticed a \u201cgrowing concern\u201d among American bosses about global trade.\n\n\u201cThey have the money to invest\" but are unwilling to commit, Spelman said. Companies decide to relocate factories from China to Mexico, for example, only to discover President Donald Trump has shifted his focus to his southern neighbour. There's no consistency in Washington's trade policy and therefore no confidence among businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe as the \u201ctrading hub\u201d of the world has suffered particularly severely at the hands of Trump\u2019s trade war with China, and is likely to continue to do so.\n\nThe numbers support this. Trade, or exports plus imports, makes up close to 80 per cent of Europe's gross domestic product (GDP) compared with 27 per cent for the USA and 38 per cent for China. This last figure may seem a little surprising, as Ward noted, but China has made great strides in reducing the economy's reliance on its external sector. Before the global financial crisis (GFC), trade comprised a similar portion of GDP as that of Europe today.\n\nWith US and European manufacturing sectors in, or close to, recession, it's no wonder there is increased talk of when that will spread to a broader economic downturn, particularly in the United States.\n\nBut predicting recessions remains a challenging business.\n\nAs Spelman wryly noted: \u201cEvery year for the past five years [it's been] said we think a recession is two years out.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm always struck by the amount of time we spend focusing on the question of when a recession will be,\" Ward said. For her, \"a much, much, more important question is how deep a recession will be\".\n\nIn the \"mild\" US recession of the early 1990s, corporate earnings fell 8 per cent and the sharemarket \"barely\" entered bear territory. Of course, in 2008 earnings, fell 40 per cent and, as we know, that was part of a severe bear market and recession.\n\nSo which will it be?\n\nOn this there are reasons for cheer when assessing any potential imminent downturn. American households are far from the heavily indebted and overextended consumers of the pre-GFC period. This suggests a degree of resilience that should also limit the associated losses in financial markets.\n\nAnd, of course, central banks have shown, by word and deed, they are committed to doing whatever they can to fend off a downturn. In this new wave of monetary easing, Ward reckons negative rates are the \"new experiment\" for policymakers.\n\nThe European Central Bank's (ECB) key policy rate is already -0.5 per cent. But it will head even lower if its policymakers can work out how to avoid punishing the banks, Ward reckons.\n\nIncredibly, in Europe markets are pricing in negative official rates for another eight years, Stealey pointed out. The ECB first pushed rates below zero in 2014 and if, markets are right (and to be fair they can move around quite a bit), they will stay that way for a full 13 years.\n\nThe Federal Reserve might get to negative rates if the dollar strengthens significantly. The Bank of England has Brexit worries keeping the currency down, but a messy resolution could get it pushing rates lower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe prospect of ever-lower rates is a boon for bondholders. Lower yields mean higher prices \u2013 a profitable diversifier for your portfolio in a period of climbing uncertainty.\n\nBut trying to generate income will be difficult.\n\nAlready a third of all government bonds by value have a negative yield. Half of them offer rates below 1 per cent.\n\nInvestors will need to look at alternatives: a push into infrastructure assets, for example, is a well-established trend that looks unlikely to change.\n\nWill all this central bank easing actually drive growth and inflation higher? This is of a key question in Australia, as it is around the developed world.\n\nMore central bank support \"might be helpful for the economy but only if it's coupled with fiscal policy\", Ward says, describing zero rates as a \"windfall\" for government finances.\n\nShe says that \"we need monetary policy and fiscal policy to work together\", but that we shouldn't hold our breath.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThe author travelled to London as a guest of JPMorgan Asset Management.", "description": "Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China is the biggest threat to the global economy, says JPMorgan chief European market strategist Karen Ward.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6917%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_782%2C$y_170/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c342a60d475f2f4bf833f4db4e451687db122428", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
