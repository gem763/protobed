He will argue it was an agreement he would never have signed had it not been for the economic duress which the bank placed on him.\n\nIn further court documents, an internal memo from RBS dated June 2010 said that there was a common theme of the APA 'wanting us to use West Register to acquire property assets', and using its power to force GRG down that route.\n\nAn investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority found that RBS had failed to handle the 'inherent' conflicts of interest which arose when West Register acquired assets from distressed businesses in GRG.\n\nIt added that between 2008 and 2013, GRG focused on extracting money from thousands of smaller companies.\n\nThe restructuring group caused 'material financial distress' at one in six of the 'viable' companies it managed, the report stated.\n\nA spokesman for RBS said last night: 'The bank fundamentally disagrees with Mr Morley's claims and does not believe they have any merit. It is contesting them vigorously in court.\n\n'The bank incurred around \u00a330million of losses on the \u00a375million it lent to Mr Morley, who was a sophisticated customer in receipt of extensive professional advice.\n\nThe consensual deal ultimately reached with the bank was proposed by Mr Morley and his advisers.'", "description": "Rose, 49, who is stepping up from deputy chief exec at Natwest to chief exec of its owner, will be faced with a court case over one of the longest running and most toxic disputes in the bank's history.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
