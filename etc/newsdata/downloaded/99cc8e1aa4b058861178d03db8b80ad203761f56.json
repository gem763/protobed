He\u2019s still got a bit of sleep left in his voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just woke up,\u201d he remarks.\n\nThe rapper, whose real name is Brian Imanuel, speaks into the phone from his native Indonesia, a solid 11-hour time difference between us.\n\nThe artist, who\u2019s one of Asian-centric label 88Rising\u2019s biggest acts, first amassed a following for his dry internet humor and sarcasm. Today, however, he seems contemplative and earnest \u2015 traits that feel more congruous with his trajectory in music.\n\nWhile mainstream (whiter) audiences may not be familiar with his name, the rapper has been deemed an unexpected favorite among Asian listeners and beyond for years, representing a racial group in a genre where they continue to struggle with legitimacy. Now at 20 years old, he\u2019s weeks away from embarking on \u201cThe Sailor\u201d North American tour, promoting his recent sophomore album of the same name. His new tracks evidence a more sophisticated, evolved artist compared to the earlier work that propelled him to his prominent place in the Asian hip-hop movement.\n\nRich Brian\u2019s rise is, at its core, the story of an underdog. Yet along with the tale\u2019s inspiring elements exist a few cringe-worthy ones in the mix as well.\n\nSince his start in the music industry, Rich Brian tells HuffPost that he\u2019s experienced significant epiphanies that have prompted a sort of rebranding. While the rapper rose through the viral charts, attracting massive buzz in the Asian American community, as well as the greater hip hop universe, for his flows about violence and money under the problematic moniker \u201cRich Chigga,\u201d he\u2019s learned a thing or two on his musical voyage.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m a lot focused on myself and ... the actual message and less focused on the flows and flexing,\u201d he tells me.\n\nJust a few years ago, the rapper was a home-schooled teen and internet comedian of sorts, who learned English through YouTube and possessed a strong yearning to visit the U.S.\n\nHe\u2019d get his shot, too. In 2016, he released his own music video for song \u201cDat $tick\u201d under his former name, a fusion of \u201cChinese\u201d and the N-word. The video went wildly viral, generating millions of streams. Perhaps most remarkable to audiences was that a kid donning a fanny pack and pink polo was, in fact, the artist behind the ratatat flow and voice that hovers several octaves below where one would expect it to be.\n\nThe song skyrocketed his career. He signed to 88Rising that very week, a move that would eventually bring him around the world, including to the States. He also received nods of approval from the likes of Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s Ghostface Killah, who later appeared on a remix of the song. Many fans in the Asian American fans interpreted the rapper\u2019s virality as a sign that more space had been made for the community in hip-hop. But under an already-problematic name, it was impossible for listeners to ignore the fact that he touted lyrics about a street lifestyle he did not lead and repeatedly used the N-word. Soon, he found himself confronting criticisms of cultural appropriation.\n\nI used to think that, because I\u2019m a rapper, that\u2019s all I\u2019m allowed to talk about. I\u2019ve realized you can talk about anything. You can literally talk about anything. You can talk about your dog, you can talk about the skies. ... As long as you word it in a way that\u2019s interesting and listenable, you can make a song about anything and that\u2019s what I tried to do with this album. Rich Brian on his deviation from his earliest work.\n\nThere was, of course, an internal reckoning and by New Year\u2019s Day 2018, the rapper changed his name to its current iteration. As time has gone on, he says his understanding of the genre has expanded. Rap, he now knows, isn\u2019t confined to stereotypes of American urban life he\u2019d played up in \u201cDat $tick.\u201d This time around, the artist leaned into his authenticity. The resulting album is thick with his own story, heavily drawing on his immigration to the U.S. and others who\u2019ve dealt with the daunting pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nIn a sense, growth for Rich Brian has meant going back to what he thoroughly knows.\n\n\u201cI used to think that, because I\u2019m a rapper, [the stereotypes] all I\u2019m allowed to talk about,\u201d he said of his earliest work. \u201cI\u2019ve realized you can talk about anything. You can literally talk about anything. You can talk about your dog, you can talk about the skies. ... As long as you word it in a way that\u2019s interesting and listenable, you can make a song about anything and that\u2019s what I tried to do with this album.\u201d\n\nRock fifty stages in all fifty states, bitch. I did it all without no citizenship to show the whole world you just got to imagine. Rich Brian on the track \"Yellow.\"\n\nThe rapper, who moved to the U.S. in 2017, underscores just how radical the act of immigration is several times throughout our conversation. How crazy it is, he says in rumination, to uproot one\u2019s entire life for a future with numerous variables. The gravity of such an act remains misunderstood to most people who haven\u2019t recently immigrated. But as wild as the transition was for him, he says that the internet allowed him to at least familiarize himself with a few pockets of American culture. Those who came decades before, however, didn\u2019t have that luxury. He feels the album is, in part, an attempt to humanize what has often been illustrated in media through policies and numbers.\n\nHis single \u201cYellow,\u201d in particular, is woven from the threads of his own immigrant arc. While the track begins with a tinge of melancholia, mirroring his difficulties moving stateside, it progresses with grand orchestral swells, eventually ending in his personal triumph.\n\n\u201cRock fifty stages in all fifty states, bitch,\u201d he spits. \u201cI did it all without no citizenship to show the whole world you just got to imagine.\u201d\n\nThe song\u2019s name is also symbolic of a victory. The rapper told HuffPost that, while the word yellow has been historically weaponized against the Asian community, his song is a hopeful reclamation of the term.\n\nEver since I made that song, It\u2019s cool to feel like \u2018yeah, I\u2019m yellow. It\u2019s tight.\u2019 Rich Brian\n\n\u201cI was so inspired to write about how I felt in the moment and be as honest and vulnerable as I can,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that I\u2019ve never really talked about before. This could be a really big thing because I have such a big platform and a lot of [fans] from Asia or just like Asian American kids. This is the perfect platform and perfect time to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since I made that song, It\u2019s cool to feel like \u2018yeah, I\u2019m yellow. It\u2019s tight,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nNowadays, the rapper seems adamant about preserving his own, uncorrupted story and honoring his fans. And that is, conceivably, why he isn\u2019t particularly concerned with earning the seal of approval of mainstream gatekeepers of the music industry \u2015 places where Asian hip-hop artists have traditionally felt absent.\n\nWhen it comes to Asian rappers, few have reached the annals of hip hop history or even just earned the validation from major label execs. MC Jin, who famously became the first Asian American solo artist to sign to a major label, achieved the feat decades ago. Such few solo acts have followed since that Jay Park\u2019s signing with Roc Nation in 2017 was heralded as an inconceivable, awe-inspiring move. When it comes to the big awards shows like the Grammys or the Billboard Music Awards, Asian faces are almost negligible in the best song or artist categories.\n\nIn Rich Brian\u2019s case, many were confounded by the rapper\u2019s absence from XXL Magazine\u2019s Freshman Class, an annual list of rookie hip-hop artists on their come up who\u2019ve generated significant buzz.\n\nHe\u2019s not ignorant to the racial disparities in the industry, either, though. However, he\u2019s optimistic and feels that by making music and refusing to shy away from his identity, minds could change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a fact that there are people who haven\u2019t accepted us for sure. It might just be something that takes time, something that I\u2019m constantly working really hard to try to change. This is why I do what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is just to come out in a really powerful way to the point where people can\u2019t ignore it. At the end of the day, if the art that you\u2019re making is good, people have no choice but to pay attention.\u201d", "description": "The Indonesia-born artist once fielded criticisms of cultural appropriation.
