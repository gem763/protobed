It wouldn\u2019t matter who the Democrats nominated for 2020. They could run Bernie Sanders on a ticket balanced by Elizabeth Warren and promise to make Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez secretary of the Treasury and Ilhan Omar secretary of Defense, and they\u2019d still win.\n\nA significant portion of the Republican Party would consider a Senate conviction of Trump a dastardly betrayal. Perhaps most would get over it, as partisan feelings kicked in around a national election, but not all. And so a party that has managed to win the popular vote in a presidential election only once since 1988 would hurtle toward November 2020 divided.\n\nHow does anyone think that would turn out?\n\nA lot of Trump supporters are going to want to blame the Republican establishment even if Trump loses in 2020 fair and square, with the backing of the united party apparatus. Imagine what they will think if a couple of dozen Republican senators decide to deny him the opportunity to run for reelection, without a single Republican voter having a say on his ultimate fate. It\u2019s hard to come up with any scenario better designed to stoke the populist furies of Trump\u2019s most devoted voters.\n\nTrump himself isn\u2019t going to get convicted by the Senate and say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m a little disappointed in your judgment to be honest. But it was a close call, and Mike Pence is a great guy, and I\u2019m just grateful I had the opportunity to serve this country in the White House for more than three years.\u201d\n\nHe won\u2019t go away quietly to lick his wounds. He won\u2019t delete his Twitter account. He won\u2019t make it easy on anyone. He will vent his anger and resentment at every opportunity. It will be \u201chuman scum\u201d every single day.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as though the media is going to lose its interest in the most luridly telegenic politician that we\u2019ve ever seen. The mainstream press would be delighted to see Trump destroyed, yet sad to bid him farewell. The obvious way to square the circle would be to continue to give Trump lavish coverage in his post-presidency. He\u2019d be out of the White House but still driving screaming CNN chyrons every other hour.\n\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s removal wouldn\u2019t be a fresh start for Pence and the GOP in an accelerated post-Trump era; it would be more like getting stuck in the poisonous epilogue of the Trump era, awaiting the inevitable advent of the Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg era.\n\nAll of this is why the \u201ccracks in the Republican Senate\u201d coverage is so ridiculous and overwrought. It depends on the idea that GOP senators \u2014 who, it is true, are continually frustrated by Trump\u2019s controversies \u2014 are on the verge of engineering their party\u2019s own destruction. There was even some \u201ccracks showing\u201d analysis around Mitch McConnell saying the other day that he didn\u2019t remember a conversation with Trump, as recounted by the president, praising his call with the Ukrainian president. The obvious explanation is that McConnell really didn\u2019t recall such a conversation, not that the shrewdest, most realistic politician in Washington was getting ready to immolate himself and his party as soon as the articles of impeachment arrive from the House.\n\nMitt Romney has gotten a lot of coverage for his excoriating comments about the Ukraine mess and the Syria pullout. He really might vote to convict when it comes to it, but he\u2019s not a broad indicator of the direction of the party. As goes Romney on impeachment ... so goes Romney on impeachment.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to come up with a scenario in which Ukraine developments are much worse than it\u2019s possible to imagine right now, and Trump\u2019s support craters, even among Republicans. Then, you might have GOP senators voting to convict. This is just another path to the destruction of the party\u2019s hopes in 2020, though, because there\u2019s no way it would snap back from a Nixonian meltdown at the top in less than a year.\n\nIn short, Mike Pence might be elected president one day, but it\u2019s not going to be while presiding over a party that has just jettisoned Donald Trump.\n\nThis article tagged under: Opinion\n\nLowry Opinion", "description": "A significant portion of the GOP would consider a Senate conviction of the president a dastardly betrayal.", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Rich Lowry"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3c/3b/574477e94062bddd9a32c1f2bcf9/mag-lowry-trump-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
