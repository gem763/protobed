Yet that does not mean that all attention to this important public policy concern need be deferred for over a year. The pause actually creates an opportunity for a timely alternative that could help the legislative process immensely in the interim. A simple bill to create a National Commission on Consumer Privacy could explore this area with breadth and depth, while also building necessary bipartisan consensus for any legislation that may develop down the road.\n\nCommissions such as this must be established formally by Congress, and they have served our country well in providing independent advice and making recommendations for changes in public policy based on expert research, data analysis, and information gained through onsite visits. With consumer privacy top of mind among lawmakers, regulators, the business community, and consumer protection groups, such a commission would be invaluable as an efficient and effective means to explore the issues raised by the Business Roundtable executives, along with others to be added.\n\nAs the Congressional Research Service itself has noted, \u201cThroughout American history, Congress has found commissions to be useful tools in the legislative process, and legislators continue to use them today.\u201d More than 100 commissions have been established during the past 30 years, with recent positive examples such as the Creating Options for Veterans Expedited Recovery Commission, the National Commission on Hunger, and the Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHaving a commission before the sausage factory of actual legislation is opened up would provide a highly visible national forum for consumer privacy that marshals greater expertise than may be readily available to existing staff in Congress, and enable greater depth than may be practical for lawmakers who face the realities of multitasking on steroids. Commissions historically have been either nonpartisan or bipartisan.\n\nThis means that if organized with care, such a commission could make its findings and recommendations more likely to be accepted by the public and embodied in actual legislation that could be signed into law. Congress also would have a sense of ownership from day one, since commission appointees would be selected in part or whole by members of Congress themselves.\n\nThere are enough cynics in Washington who would view this proposal as creating just another mini bureaucracy to minimize the chances that anything will really be accomplished in this area. After all, some would argue that if Congress needs to make tough choices regarding consumer privacy legislation, it would be better to do this sooner and more directly than establish a commission that it may later disavow in the interest of blame avoidance.\n\nBut on balance, and given the impeachment inquiry that continues apace, a commission on consumer privacy can be designed to be the locomotive for a train already in motion rather than a sidecar that may derail greater government oversight. There is no cookie cutter approach for what is needed to create a useful commission here, but enabling legislation should be prioritized over moving swiftly to draft, debate, revise, and reconcile actual bills.\n\nThe mandate of the commission and its duties and powers, its membership structure and appointment scheme, and a termination date for reporting back to Congress are the obvious places to start. Field hearings by the commission around the country would be especially useful to authorize, since they would enable the commission to hear from diverse stakeholders and generate political capital for the tough legislative battle that consumer privacy will certainly trigger.\n\nA National Commission on Consumer Privacy is a practical measure, plus it has a nice ring to it. This call to action should be well received both in the House and the Senate, and across the political aisle, since Republicans and Democrats alike are keenly interested in exploring workable legislative options.\n\nStuart Brotman is a former government official and fellow in digital privacy policy issues with the Science and Technology Innovation Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars based in Washington.", "description": "The ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump seems to be sucking the oxygen out of Capitol Hill, with prospects for comprehensive federal privacy legislation now looking dim before the 2020 election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/laptop542057882.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
