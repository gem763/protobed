REUTERS/Olivia Harris/Files\n\nMalaysian and U.S. investigators say about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from now-defunct state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), set up in 2009 by Najib.\n\nNajib, who lost a general election last year, is now facing dozens of graft and money laundering charges over allegations that he received about $1 billion in 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nLatheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia\u2019s Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), said 420 million ringgit ($100 million) was received by a total of 80 individuals and entities from 1MDB.
