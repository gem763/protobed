As in the original, the creatures are still stealing socks and annoying Canadian pets.\n\nBut as technology has evolved since 2019, so too has the house hippo.\n\n\"We might be wondering why we're using so much data overnight when we're in bed sleeping and it turns out that hippos, like us, love to use our devices at night and play games, surf the net, check things out online,\" said Hill.\n\nAs Canadians enjoy unprecedented access to information through our internet-connected devices, Hill believes the need for media literacy is more essential than ever.\n\n\"There's misinformation, false information, accusations of fake news that may be true or not true,\" said Hill. \"And so we think the house hippo is more important than ever, and that's why we brought them back.\"\n\nAccording to Hill, 90 per cent of Canadians have admitted to falling for information that was later proven false.\n\nBut she understands why some folks might want to suspend their disbelief in this particular case.\n\n\"It's playful and it's cute and magical. And I think it speaks to the children in all of us.\"\n\nTo hear more from Kathryn Ann Hill, download our podcast or click Listen above.", "description": "Twenty years ago, a Canadian infomercial about a fictional household pest went viral.
