In response to the kingdom's request, the president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature, and primarily focused on air and missile defense.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"We will also work to accelerate the delivery of military equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to enhance their ability to defend themselves,\" he added.\n\nThe announcement followed an hourslong meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump in which Pentagon leaders outlined a series of options to respond to the drone and missile attacks attributed to Iran or its proxies in the region.\n\nMarine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters the number of American personnel needed is still being determined but said it would be a \"moderate deployment,\" and likely \"not thousands\" of troops.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t decided on specific units,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now my job to come back to the secretary with details of what we believe would meet the Saudis\u2019 requirements.\u201d\n\nHe added he will do that \u201cearly next week\u201d following a recommendation from U.S. Central Command, the military headquarters responsible for the Middle East.\n\nBut the new forces will \"mitigate the risk of swarms of drones or other attacks that could come from Iran,\u201d Dunford explained.\n\nThe U.S. will also encourage other nations to contribute, Esper and Dunford said.\n\nThey both blamed Iran for the attack that crippled Saudi oil production last weekend -- not Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia and UAE have been targeting from the air in a long-running civil war.\n\n\"...The weapons used in the attack were Iranian-produced and were not launched from Yemen as was originally claimed,\" said Esper, noting that \u201call indications are that Iran was responsible for the attack.\u201d\n\nBut he did not provide any details to support that conclusion.\n\n\u201cRegardless of where you think it came from, the fact is,\" he added, \"the Saudis were attacked by both drones and cruise missiles and are still vulnerable to attack.\"\n\nThe new forces will join about 500 U.S. troops dispatched in July after Iran was blamed for shooting down a U.S. spy drone over international waters and seized commercial ships. That marked the first major deployment of U.S. forces since the Pentagon withdrew from an airbase in the country in 2003.\n\nSmall numbers of U.S. advisers have remained in the intervening years to help train Saudi forces with training.\n\nEsper would not rule out additional steps, including military action against Iran.\n\n\u201cAs the president has made clear, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran. That said, we have many other military options available should they be necessary,\u201d he said. \"This is the first step we are taking in response to these attacks.\"\n\nThis article tagged under: Saudi Arabia\n\nMark Esper", "description": "The announcement followed an hours-long meeting in the Oval Office with President Trump over how to respond to Iranian attacks.", "authors": ["Wesley Morgan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b4/fc/5bab88b344c9886bcedd6e9f6b06/190618-mark-esper-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
