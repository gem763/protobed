We must encourage their architectural ambition, innovation, bravery and skill,' he said.\n\n'From the way that Cork House experiments with entirely plant-based materials, to Goldsmith Street\u2019s ultra-low energy affordable homes, each of these six buildings pushes the boundaries of architecture, exceeding what has been done before, and providing solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our times.'\n\nReaction to this year's nominees has been largely positive compared to criticism placed on 2018's winner. Bloomberg's European headquarters in London, which cost an eye-watering \u00a31.3bn, drew negative reactions due to its lavish design and anti rough sleeper seating, which was not seen as being in touch with the housing crisis affecting the rest of London.\n\nThe nominees for this year's RIBA Stirling Prize are:\n\nLondon Bridge Station\n\nHome to thousands of commuters every day since 1836, London Bridge is the only London building project nominated this year. Last year it reopened following a \u00a31 billion transformation, with a shiny new 15-platform concourse and lower-level shopping centre.\n\nIt has been rebuilt three times before, in 1849 and 1864 and once again in a extensive re-fit during the 1970s while changing tracks and signalling. Completed in January last year, the project by Grimshaw Architects is the biggest railway upgrade since Victorian times.\n\nThe \u00a31 billion transformation of London Bridge station, the largest rail upgrade since Victorian times which finished last year, is the only nominee from the capital to make it this far\n\nLondon Bridge's main concourse was reopened last year for the first time since 2012. The station now holds 15 rail platforms and a refurbished underground entrance\n\nVictorian brickwork at the base of the station was either restored or reused elsewhere in the station for the redevelopment\n\nCork House, Berkshire\n\nMade almost entirely from cork, this 'first of its kind' home in Eton is an example of an experimental, carbon-neutral home.\n\nIt was tested and developed in partnership with The Bartlett School of Architecture UCL, it was constructed entirely by hand in a manner 'designed for disassembly', with all its components capable of being be reused.\n\nIt has already won the RIBA South Award 2019, with a RIBA spokesman saying: 'An entirely cork construction, with solid structural cork walls and roof, the building has exceptionally low whole-life carbon.'\n\nMade almost entirely from cork, this 'first of its kind' home in Eton has been shortlisted for its 'exceptionally low whole-life carbon' properties. Made entirely by hand, the structure is 'designed for disassembly' so that materials can be reused\n\nThe pyramidal roofs and walls are all designed to be disassembled, meaning the materials can all be reused or recycled in the future\n\nThe contemporary home is dominated by natural materials, and during the day uses natural light that pours through the Aztec-pyramidal roof holes to avoid using electricity\n\nGoldsmith Street, Norwich\n\n105 new energy efficient homes designed for social housing have created a highly sustainable community around a number of streets. The shortlisted entry includes a children\u2019s playground, curved walkways that act as modern 'back alleys', and several communal gardens.\n\nIt is the largest Passivhaus scheme in the UK, whereby insulation and light-absorbing materials mean the properties do not rely on any fuel-heating methods, and are instead 'passively' heated by things like the sun and humans inside the properties.\n\nArchitects Mikhail Riches, who won the contract to create these homes for the council, designed the highly sustainable community over a number of streets with an interconnected design.\n\n105 new energy efficient homes designed for social housing have created a highly sustainable community around a number of streets.

Housed inside a converted 17th-century stable block, the new theatre space opened in June last year, winning four RIBA awards.\n\nThe theatre makes the most of its intimate space and mixes old elements like its ironstone walls with a new rectangular roof and balcony. It was designed by architects Witherford Watson Mann, while theatre design experts Sound Space Vision provided the acoustics.\n\nHaled as an 'indisputable triumph', there Nevill Holt Opera is considered to be among the most unique opera houses in the country.
