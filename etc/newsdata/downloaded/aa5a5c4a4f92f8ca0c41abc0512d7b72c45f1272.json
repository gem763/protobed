I wanted to understand them more,\" Yamada said in a phone interview.\n\nThe result is a trip back in time that taps the sense of joy and humor found within the pages of old family albums.\n\nFrom flea markets to auction houses\n\nThe photographer studied how old photographic albums were used to convey unity and bond between family members. Credit: Rie Yamada\n\nYamada first thought of her visual project while undertaking a bachelors degree in arts in Berlin, Germany. There, she studied how old photographic albums were used to convey the unity and bond between family members.\n\nShe soon found herself hunting for real albums at flea markets in Germany, where she now lives, and at online auctions in Japan.\n\n\"I wanted to capture the stories of two cultures, and I wanted to find out about it from people I didn't know,\" said Yamada. \"You can't just sum up families, they have a lot of patterns.\"\n\nYamada reconstructed images from 10 family albums she salvaged from stalls and online shops in Germany and Japan. Credit: Rie Yamada\n\nYamada selected albums from the 1940s to the 1990s, each with 100 or more photographs so she could get to know more about the family and delve deeper into their visual narratives.\n\nForgotten artifacts like an airplane ticket left in an East German album revealed one family's beach holiday in Bulgaria. Another showed a vintage magazine published two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1991, suggesting the family's album dated from that era.\n\nYamada chose her images carefully, selecting ones where people were posing, aware of the camera, and actively conveying the sense that they were a family unit.\n\nBefore staging each scene, either in a studio or outside, Yamada made sure she understood the image within the broader context of the family's life as revealed in the album.\n\nYamada selected albums from the 1940s to the 1990s, each with 100 or more photographs so she could get to know more about the family. Credit: Rie Yamada\n\nShe initially thought of using models to pose as each family member, but was worried they would need too much direction and be unable to grasp the context. \"As I'm using other people's stories and their privacy, I didn't want to misrepresent them,\" she said.\n\nThat's why Yamada chose to use props, disguises, and creative editing to play the role of the characters herself.\n\nPlaying each family member\n\nThe process of becoming someone else is no easy feat.\n\nJust like an actor preparing for a scene, Yamada studied each family members' facial expressions, clothing and the objects around them. She scoured vintage clothing shops and even went to a library to locate a specific magazine article from the 1990s that she could use as a prop. When similar items could not be found, she made them herself.\n\nOne of her favorite images is of an elderly couple in colorful clothes who are smiling as they playfully pose with parrots.\n\n\"I thought this couple were retired and on holiday together,\" said Yamada. She speculates the photo was treasured by the couple as it showed signs of having been cut out and framed. \"It must have been a great memory for them.\"\n\nUsually, each photograph takes a day to stage and shoot, but this one, said Yamada, took two.\n\nYamada studied each family members' facial expressions, clothing and the objects around them. Credit: Rie Yamada\n\nShe used stuffed parrots instead of live ones, and initially had difficulty balancing them on her head while capturing the right facial expressions. \"I wasn't satisfied with my facial expressions -- I could see too much of myself in the first set of photographs, so it felt like I wasn't doing justice to those family members,\" she said.\n\nYamada shoots each photograph herself and usually has another person on standby to help.\n\nIt takes her around a day to edit each of the images on Photoshop, as she has to layer multiple people within a single frame. While important, the editing process is a lesser priority for Yamada who focuses on perfecting the characters, locations and props.\n\nCreating new stories\n\nThe images come together in an exhibition that gives the audience an opportunity to compare them to the original photos.\n\nPerhaps anticipating questions about who the people are and where they come from, Yamada has created an extra layer of detail, commissioning writers from Japan and Germany to imagine the characters' lives.\n\nThe photographer used props, disguises and creative editing to play the role of the characters in each photo.

The writer looked at the trends at the time and decided that it was the man's second marriage and the couple had met in one of Tokyo's jazz cafes. \"I could totally see how believable that story was,\" said Yamada.\n\nThe stories are displayed with a physical album to take visitors back to a time when treasured photos were printed and lovingly curated.\n\nYamada says visitors thumbed through the albums and felt nostalgic towards the periods and characters she portrayed. Some even said they had been inspired to take their own family photographs.\n\n\"I think the photo albums reaffirm the existence of a family,\" said Yamada. \"Maybe the stories for these families have ended, but if it triggered new stories, I'm happy.\"", "description": "In her new project, \"Familie Werden\" (Becoming Family), Japanese photographer Rie Yamada seeks to rekindle the value and meaning behind the family album for the modern age.", "authors": ["Hong Kong"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190813112623-familie-werden01-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-16"}
