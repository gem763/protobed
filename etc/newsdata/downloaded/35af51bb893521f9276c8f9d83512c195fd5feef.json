However, diesel remains unchanged at \u00a31.27 per litre.\n\nBy 14:30, the remaining big four supermarkets had announced they will all match the reductions over the course of the weekend.\n\nThe RAC described the cuts as 'long overdue' because 'drivers have been paying more than they should have for weeks' as retailers benefited from lower wholesale prices.\n\nLong overdue: The RAC said retailers have been profiting from lower wholesale prices and not reducing the cost of fuel at the pumps for weeks\n\nConfirming the price cut, Asda senior fuel buyer Dave Tyrer said: 'With wholesale costs falling, we're pleased to be able to pass these savings on to our customers.'\n\nAsda has been commended by motoring organisation in recent years for sparking 'fuel price wars' between the big four supermarkets by being the first to slash charges.\n\nHowever, these are far from the 'wars' they're portrayed as. Instead, the price cuts are quickly matched by rival providers and rarely bettered to ensure there isn't continued competition.\n\nThink of them as short-lived fuel battles that help the sector to consolidate.\n\nAlready, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons have jumped on the news and confirmed they will equal the cuts across their UK stores within hours of Asda's announcement.\n\nWhile Tesco will trim prices from today (Friday), Morrisons won't be reducing the cost of unleaded until Saturday, while Sainsbury's has delayed its savings for Sunday.\n\nAsda has been commended in recent years for sparking 'fuel price wars' between the big four supermarkets by announcing price cuts that are quickly matched by the rival providers\n\nPetrol price cuts should have come sooner, says RAC\n\nThe RAC has been pushing for such cuts since the start of the month as the wholesale cost of fuel that retailers pay came down around a fortnight ago.\n\nDespite the drop in wholesale prices, average unleaded pump prices have remained virtually unchanged at around \u00a31.28 per litre since mid-July, while diesel stands at \u00a31.32 per litre.\n\nIt means providers have been charging inflated prices for fuel that's costing them significantly less to buy in.\n\nDespite the drop in wholesale prices, average unleaded pump prices have remained virtually unchanged at around \u00a31.28 per litre since mid-July\n\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'Drivers have been paying more than they should have for weeks due to savings in the wholesale price of petrol which retailers have failed to pass on until today.\n\n'We pointed out this at the start of the month, yet it has taken them over a week to react. In the meantime they have all benefited nicely while drivers continued to pay more than they should.'\n\nThis table shows the difference in wholesale prices paid by retailers and pump prices for motorists over the last month\n\nHe went on to blast fuel retailers for trying to pull the wool over motorists' eyes at a time when motoring costs have soared on the back of higher taxation, rising insurance - mainly due to the rise in keyless vehicle thefts - and the introduction of inner-city charges like the ULEZ for those using older motors.\n\n'There have been times in the past when retailers have acted more transparently by passing savings brought about by lower wholesale prices, but unfortunately this won't go down as one of them,' Williams continued.\n\n'This cut should, however, lead to the average price of petrol falling as a result of all retailers following suit.\n\n'Currently, unleaded is \u00a31.28 a litre on average around the UK so this will help to move it towards \u00a31.25 in the next week or so, saving drivers more than \u00a31.50 every time they fill up.'\n\nAA fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet said the price cut would 'cheer up drivers as the summer comes to an end'.", "description": "The RAC said: 'Drivers have been paying more than they should for weeks due to savings in the wholesale price of petrol which retailers have failed to pass on.'
