This time it\u2019s about her soundtrack album The Lion King: The Gift from the Disney remake.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Presents: Making the Gift is an hour-long behind-the-scenes special about all the work that went into the film\u2019s companion album. The soundtrack itself features a slew of artists including Pharrell, Jessie Reyez, and Tekno. It also includes cameos from the cast like Donald Glover, John Oliver, Seth Rogen, and James Earl Jones.\n\nMaking the Gift was written, directed, and produced by Bey as well.\n\nThe doco is set to premiere in a couple of hours on the American ABC network. It will undoubtedly appear online legally/illegally in the following hours.\n\nFootage from the teaser includes a lot of recording sessions, a lot of choreography, and an adorable as hell snippet of Blue Ivy and Mama.\n\nBey\u2019s other documentary, Homecoming: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9, hit Netflix back in April. The doco, showcasing Bey\u2019s historic Coachella set, is reportedly one of three Netflix projects from the queen.\n\nThe deal was said to have cost the streaming giant a cool USD$60 million which sounds about right. So with this in mind it sure is possible that the Lion King doco could appear on Netflix in the coming months. We\u2019ll keep you updated.\n\nIf you\u2019ve yet to tune into Homecoming, the documentary is two hours and 17 minutes of Bey\u2019s set as the first black woman to headline Coachella. It also gives fans an intimate look at behind-the-scenes, and the amount of work and sacrifice that went into the show. Bey was originally supposed to perform at Coachella in 2017 but decided to pull out because she was pregnant with twins Sir and Rumi.\n\nAlso, it simply kicks ass.\n\nStream Homecoming: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9 on Netflix now.\n\nREAD MORE Someone In Brissy Claims To Be Making A Netflix Series About The Valley, Netflix Disagrees", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0is feeding the Beyhive with the announcement of another documentary about her work on Disney's The Lion King\u00a0remake.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/07/beyonce-lion-king-fb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
