Shares in Eisai Co (4523.T), Biogen\u2019s Japanese partner in the drug, were quoted up 18% to the daily limit high of 6,534 yen in Tokyo trading.\n\nThe field of experimental Alzheimer\u2019s treatments is littered with high-profile failures, with many major drugmakers abandoning the race to develop a medicine for a disease that makes up 60%-70% of an estimated 50 million dementia cases globally.\n\nAny medicine that effectively treats the disease is likely to become one of the world\u2019s top-selling drugs and could be transformative for Biogen, which is facing multiple challenges over its product pipeline.\n\nFiling with U.S. regulators could \u201cpotentially bring back to life a drug that had been completely left for dead,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cThe viability of such a filing is unknown, given the mixed results - in our view, Biogen is somewhat desperate for growth drivers ... so a change in narrative is badly needed.\u201d\n\nBiogen and Eisai decided to end the two late-stage trials of aducanumab in March when a so-called \u201cfutility analysis\u201d revealed the trials had little hope of succeeding.\n\nThe failure spurred demands on Wall Street for the company to spend more on acquisitions, as its mainstay multiple-sclerosis franchise faced patent challenges and its newer muscle-wasting disorder treatment, Spinraza, faced competition from Switzerland\u2019s Novartis (NOVN.S).\n\nUPHILL BATTLE\n\nBiogen said on Tuesday more data had become available after the two studies were discontinued, resulting in new analysis that showed one of the trials met the main goal, while the other did not.\n\nResults from patients in the failed second trial who had received high doses also supported the findings of the first, it added. Patients who received aducanumab experienced significant benefits on measures of cognition and function such as memory, orientation and language.\n\nBiogen said it had met with the Food and Drug Administration twice, once in June and again on Monday to discuss the data.\n\n\u201cThey (FDA) thought it was reasonable for us to submit an application for approval,\u201d said Chief Medical Officer Alfred Sandrock, who earlier this month became the company\u2019s R&D head.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Fumiyoshi Sakai said the new datasets would be presented at clinical trials meetings in early December. FDA approval was not guaranteed, and investors and analysts would remain cautious \u201cuntil we see a real product,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company said it planned to submit a marketing application for aducanumab in early 2020 based on the discussions.\n\nBaird analyst Brian Skorney said he believed FDA approval for aducanumab was highly unlikely and predicted Biogen would have an uphill task to convince regulators that the results were more than random chance.\n\nAducanumab works on the hypothesis that removing deposits of amyloid, a type of plaque, from the brain of patients in the early stages of the disease could stave off its ravages, which include loss of memory and the inability to care for oneself.\n\nA sign marks a Biogen facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. January 26, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nBiogen executives on a conference call said the results from the new analysis were positive for another Alzheimer\u2019s drug, BAN2401, which works on a similar principal and is also being jointly developed along with Eisai.\n\nThe company also reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, helped by higher demand for rare muscle disease drug, Spinraza.
