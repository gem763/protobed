Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s defense on Monday during a cabinet meeting, as the presidential candidate faces accusations from Hillary Clinton that she\u2019s being groomed by the Russians.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of her, she\u2019s the one accusing everybody of being a Russian agent. Anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent,\u201d Trump said in the meeting. \u201cThat\u2019s a scam that was pretty much put down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Tulsi, but she\u2019s not a Russian agent,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know Jill Stein. I know she likes the environment. I don\u2019t think she likes Russians. If she does like them, I know she\u2019s not an asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people are sick. There\u2019s something wrong with them,\u201d he said.\n\nGabbard has been hitting back left and right against the smears. On Monday, she posted an official video response, arguing that it was her endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016 that led to this.\n\n\"People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my 'political career,'\" Gabbard said in the video. \"They said, 'Clinton will never forget,' that she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and the media will make sure that you are destroyed.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \"If they can falsely portray me as a traitor, then they can do it to anyone\u2014and in fact, that's exactly the message they want to get across to you. If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers\u2014if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.\"", "description": ".10/22/2019 9:27:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/1ae8ba40-ff26-4ff3-8f42-ceea942d7999.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
