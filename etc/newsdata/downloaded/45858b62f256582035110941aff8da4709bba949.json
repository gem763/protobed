(AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For only the fourth time in U.S. history, the House of Representatives has started a presidential impeachment inquiry . House committees are trying to determine if President Donald Trump violated his oath of office by asking a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.\n\nA quick summary of the latest news:\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\n\u2014Testifying in defiance of Trump's ban, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, told House impeachment investigators Friday that Trump himself had pressured the State Department to oust her from her post and get her out of the country.\n\n\u2014A simple yes-or-no question keeps tripping up Senate Republicans: Should the president ask foreign countries to investigate political rivals?\n\n\u2014As the threat of impeachment looms, Trump is digging in and taking solace in the base that helped him get elected: conservative evangelical Christians who laud his commitment to enacting their agenda.\n\n___\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\n\u2014Members of Congress return to Washington on Tuesday after a two-week recess that gave them an opportunity to hear firsthand from constituents on how they feel about the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u2014On Monday, Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser who focused on Russia, is expected to appear in private before House committees leading the investigation, and three current State Department officials are tentatively scheduled for this coming week. They include Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. He was blocked from appearing last week but whose attorney said he would testify on Thursday\n\n___\n\nNUMBERS THAT MATTER\n\nNearly all House Democrats \u2014 229 out of 235 \u2014 say they support the inquiry that could lead to an impeachment vote against Trump, according to an Associated Press survey of members. Add Republican-turned-independent Justin Amash of Michigan, who also backs the inquiry, and the total rises to 230. Democrats need 218 votes to pass articles of impeachment.\n\nOnly four Democrats have said they oppose the probe: Reps. Anthony Brindisi of New York, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey.\n\nRep. Jared Golden of Maine is undecided about the inquiry and Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia has not stated her position to the AP.\n\nAll these Democrats have one thing in common: Trump won their districts in 2016.\n\n__\n\nWORTH READING\n\nYovanovitch testified to congressional investigators behind closed doors Friday, but her prepared opening remarks were obtained by the AP. In them, she expresses dismay at being recalled from Kyiv after learning that Trump had \"lost confidence\" in her and had pressed the State Department to remove her: http://apne.ws/3feeyLS", "description": "For only the fourth time in U.S. history, the House of Representatives has started a presidential impeachment inquiry .
