It was big Grand Prix today, not so many clear rounds, and I think it was an exciting class to be in.\"\n\nMaher won his second event of the season with a clear round in 38.76 seconds. Marlon Modolo Zanotelli and VDL Edgar M of Brazil finished second, in 39.20 seconds, while Germany's Ludger Beerbaum and Cool Feeling were third, in 39.39 seconds.\n\nThirty-one riders failed to reach the jump-off, held over a technical course set by Uliano Vezzani in the compact, sandy arena of the scenic Stadio dei Marmi, which is surrounded by 59 classical marble statues depicting different sports.\n\nModolo Zanotelli was delighted with his second-place finish, which handed him a ticket to the lucrative LGCT Super Grand Prix, held in Prague at the end of the season.", "description": "Britain's Ben Maher claimed the overall lead on the Longines Global Champions Tour for the world's top show jumpers with a second straight win in Rome.", "authors": ["Danielle Rossingh", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190907211607-maher-rome-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
