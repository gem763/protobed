The statement came as a relief to market participants suffering from growing concerns over the U.S. and global economic slowdown owing to the fierce trade battle.\n\n\n\nPartial Trade Deal in the Offing\n\n\n\nAccording to President Trump, the first phase of the deal will address issues related to safeguarding of U.S. intellectual property rights, including force transfer or theft of technologies, reform of the Chinese financial markets and China\u2019s practice of arbitrarily setting foreign-exchange rate. Moreover, China has agreed to purchase $40-$50 billion worth U.S. agricultural products.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government has decided to scrap its decision to raise tariff rates from 25% to 30% on $250 billon Chinese goods, mostly used as intermediaries for high-tech U.S. products, effective Oct 15. Also, no decision has been taken on the planned new set of 15% tariff on $160 billion Chinese exports, effective Dec 15.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump said that the first phase of the deal will be signed within the next three weeks and the second phase will start almost immediately after the completion of the first part.\n\n\n\nSeveral economists and financial experts remain skeptical about the partial trade deal since it has still not completely addressed the major concerns of the U.S. government like forced technology transfer and currency war. Yet, a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, which has already lasted for more than a year, will act as a major driver for the market.\n\n\n\nWall Street welcomed the move as three major stock indexes ---- the Dow, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite ---- rallied 1.2%, 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively.\n\n\n\nWhy Trade Solution is Important\n\n\n\nChina is the largest trading partner of the United States. Moreover, China plays the role of a low-cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high-tech U.S. industries. U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy on higher tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods which raised prices of high-tech equipment and electronics products.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a trade spat with the United States resulted in a significant slowdown of China\u2019s economy. However, a strong Chinese economy will give U.S. high-tech companies a solid boost as China is also the largest market for U.S. high-tech products.\n\n\n\nA solution to the U.S.-China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth, which in turn will create demand for high-tech U.S. products. Likewise, the repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U.S. tech giants.\n\n\n\nOther Likely Gains for the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's office said that China has given assurance of importing \"a substantial amount\" of agricultural, energy, and manufactured goods and services from the United States. The Trump administration wants China to lift tariffs on U.S. agricultural products or at least shift those to other products. If this happens, the trade deal will allow Trump to portray it as a win for U.S. farmers.\n\n\n\nMoreover, a strong economic and political relationship between the two countries will help U.S. companies, operating in other fields like restaurants, gaming and e-commerce segments to prosper in the future.\n\n\n\nStocks to Watch\n\n\n\nThe major gainers of a possible trade deal will be those companies that have a strong international exposure especially in China. We have narrowed our search to five such stocks which have moved higher in 2019 so far and still have upside. All five stocks currently carry either a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).
