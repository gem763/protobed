Bourne\u2019s study of this copy, which has been housed in the Free Library of Philadelphia since 1944, dated the annotator to the mid-17th century, finding them alive to \u201cthe sense, accuracy, and interpretative possibility of the dialogue\u201d. She also provided many images of the handwritten notes, which struck Scott-Warren as looking oddly similar to Milton\u2019s hand.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Milton\u2019s annotated first folio of Shakespeare\n\n\u201cBut I always think \u2018I recognise that handwriting,\u2019\u201d Scott-Warren said. \u201cI go and check and normally I\u2019m wrong. This time I thought: \u2018The case is getting stronger and stronger\u2019.\u201d\n\nAs evidence stacked up, he said he became \u201cquite trembly \u2026 You\u2019re gathering evidence with your heart in your mouth.\u201d\n\nThe first folio is the first collected edition of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, published seven years after his death. Without it, 18 plays including Macbeth and The Tempest might have been lost to history. Around 750 first folios were printed, with 233 known to survive. They command huge sums at auction, with one selling for \u00a31.87m three years ago.\n\nScott-Warren has made a detailed comparison of the annotator\u2019s handwriting with the Paradise Lost poet\u2019s. He also believes that the work the annotator did to improve the text of the folio \u2013 suggesting corrections and supplying additional material such as the prologue to Romeo and Juliet, along with cross-references to other works \u2013 is similar to work Milton did in other books that survive from his library, including his copy of Boccaccio\u2019s Life of Dante.\n\nThe scholar tentatively suggested in a blogpost that he might have identified John Milton\u2019s copy of the Shakespeare First Folio of 1623, admitting that, \u201cin this as in other cases, there\u2019s usually a lot of wishful thinking, plus copious spinning of the evidence to make it seem plausible, and elision of anything that doesn\u2019t seem to fit\u201d.\n\nBut he soon found that other scholars were agreeing with him. \u201cNot only does this hand look like Milton\u2019s, but it behaves like Milton\u2019s writing elsewhere does, doing exactly the things Milton does when he annotates books, and using exactly the same marks,\u201d said Dr Will Poole at New College Oxford. \u201cShakespeare is our most famous writer, and the poet John Milton was his most famous younger contemporary. It was, until a few days ago, simply too much to hope that Milton\u2019s own copy of Shakespeare might have survived \u2014 and yet the evidence here so far is persuasive. This may be one of the most important literary discoveries of modern times.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s been weighing in, every day someone suggests a new similarity,\u201d Scott-Warren said. \u201cI feel 100% sure, but there are still people out there who remain to be convinced. I guess there is a question of if other people could have very similar handwriting.\u201d\n\nAs well as numerous textual annotations, the folio also contains a host of line markings, showing the annotator\u2019s engagement with, particularly, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, The Tempest, Henry IV, As You Like It and King Lear. Scott-Warren believes these can be traced to Milton\u2019s own work.\n\n\u201cThe book is absolutely covered with lines in the margin of passages and when you\u2019re reading those thinking the annotator is Milton they become really interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they echo with his work, the sense that the volume offers you the opportunity to read Shakespeare through Milton\u2019s eyes. Because the lines in the margin don\u2019t give you any verbal content, you don\u2019t know why he\u2019s singled out a passage for attention, but it forces you to think your way into Milton\u2019s head and it does really chime with a lot of what goes on in his poetry, so you can see him constructing himself through Shakespeare.\u201d\n\nOne highlighted section in The Tempest is the song: \u201cCome unto these yellow sands, / And then take hands: / Courtsied when you have and kiss\u2019d / The wild waves whist.\u201d The unusual rhyme, of \u201ckiss\u2019d\u201d and \u201cwhist\u201d, is echoed in Milton\u2019s On the Morning of Christ\u2019s Nativity: \u201cThe winds with wonder whist, / Smoothly the waters kist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would already have known about that allusion, they are the only two writers who used that rhyme, but you can see him marking it in the text and responding to it,\u201d said Scott-Warren. \u201cIt gives you a sense of his sensitivity and alertness to Shakespeare. What\u2019s quite remarkable as well is that he\u2019s singled out for attention lots of the passages that have become incredibly famous \u2013 he goes through and marks out some of the most celebrated Shakespearean speeches.\u201d\n\nIt has always been known that Shakespeare was a huge influence on Milton \u2013 in his poem On Shakespeare, Milton calls him a \u201cson of Memory\u201d and \u201cgreat heir of fame\u201d, writing of how \u201cThou in our wonder and astonishment / Hast built thyself a live-long monument.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this allows us to see the encounter happening,\u201d said Scott-Warren. \u201cIt shows you the firsthand encounter between two great writers, which you don\u2019t often get to see, especially in this period. A lot of that kind of evidence is lost, so that\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\n\nHe is now intending to collaborate with Bourne on a series of articles about the find. \u201cHaving these annotations might allow us to identify further books that have been annotated by Milton,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is evidence of how digital technology and the opening up of libraries [could] transform our knowledge of this period.\u201d", "description": "Hailed as one of the most significant archival discoveries of modern times, text seems to show the Paradise Lost poet making careful annotations on his edition of Shakespeare\u2019s plays", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5fe8405f220ee98ff86a583a58126a4293fb0f3/22_131_1019_611/master/1019.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=47a2c8ca9ab0c8e3035385b65cb75238", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
