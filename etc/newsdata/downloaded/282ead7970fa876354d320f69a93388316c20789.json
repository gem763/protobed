Adam Schiff\n\nDemocrats have subpoenaed several Trump administration officials and diplomats for documents as lawmakers probe issues surrounding the phone call. House Democrats have accused Trump of violating his oath of office by asked him to investigate Ukraine's involvement in the 2016 presidential election and the activities of Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter, a former board member of gas company Burisma Holdings. They have also accused Trump of withholding military aid from Ukraine until Zelensky's government could launch the investigations.\n\nThe impeachment probe was launched last month after an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint raised concerns about the call.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump again referred to the impeachment inquiry as a \"hoax\" and \"so bad for our country,\" adding that he released a memorandum of the conversation with Zelensky to show it was a \"perfectly fine call.\"\n\nWhen Pirro asked why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wasn't calling for a formal vote to open an impeachment inquiry, Trump said it was because she \"can't get the votes because we're [the GOP] doing so well right now.\"\n\nTrump held two rallies in as many days this week, and both drew such large crowds that they could have sold both out many times over, he said.\n\n\"We're winning and we're winning big,\" Trump said. \"That's why I think they want to stay away. If you look at what's happening, the electricity for the Republican Party, they're so angry at what's taken place.\"\n\n\"We're winning and we're winning big. That's why I think they want to stay away.\" \u2014 President Trump\n\nTrump also expressed confidence in his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, despite the arrest this week of two associates of the former New York City mayor on campaign finance charges.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"He's a great gentleman. He was a great mayor, one of the greatest, maybe the greatest mayor in the history of New York,\" the president said. \"He was a fantastic prosecutor.
