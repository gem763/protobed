It was seemingly devoid of any nutritional value, but also lacking the sweet or savory kick of my favored neon-colored after-school refreshments. The few times that I did unwrap and microwave a bag of Pop Secret (from the same jumbo box that, I believe, has sat in my parents\u2019 cupboard for a minimum of 17 years), I was greeted by the acrid taste of butter substitute. Even worse, multiple uncooked kernels were lying in wait to be unknowingly scooped up in a handful and wreak havoc on my teeth.\n\nIn recent years, though, my relationship with popcorn changed amid what I like to call the gourmet popcorn renaissance, and I have joined the ranks of the devoutly converted. Old cult favorites have reached new levels of popularity, and new pre-popped options are cloud-like vehicles for inventive flavors from salty to sweet. The variety of delicious gourmet popcorns currently has me hooked on a few bags a week, and constantly scanning bodega aisles and websites and online forums (yes, they exist) for new and exciting combinations. Below are some of my favorite gourmet popcorns, including my weekly standbys, my formal popcorns, and a few flavors I want to try.\n\nThe true king\n\nBjorn Qorn Popcorn A pair of Bard grads making artisanal popcorn using giant mirrors might sound more like an episode of Portlandia than reality. But that\u2019s exactly the story behind Brooklyn-based Bjorn Qorn, which has quickly become the standard-bearer for all things fancy popcorn \u2014 and the brand I stock in doomsday-prepper\u2013like quantities in my home (Strategist editor Katy Schneider is also a fan). I\u2019m partial to the Original flavor, which is dusted with nutritional yeast to give it a taste reminiscent of a nutty cheddar corn, except this one is vegan. Not only does it have an unreal umami flavor, but it\u2019s also packed with B vitamins and protein (thanks to the yeast) so you can fool yourself into thinking you\u2019re being healthy. Every person who I\u2019ve shared a bag with (even those puzzled or disgusted by the words \u201cnutritional yeast\u201d) has immediately fallen in deep snack love and never looked back. The price shown for Amazon is for a three-ounce bag; on Mouth, it\u2019s for a one-ounce bag. $14 at Amazon Buy $4 at Mouth Buy\n\nThe sweet standby\n\nHarry & David Moose Munch Premium Popcorn Duo, Milk Chocolate and Caramel Mix Growing up, my mom would tell me stories of getting sleep-away camp care packages full of this chocolate-and-caramel-covered popcorn mix. But in the pre-internet wilderness of the early \u201990s, the tasty treat seemed out of reach. (I sadly all too late found out that the Harry & David catalogue exists.) Luckily, as I grew up, technology advanced, and I finally got to try this crazy delicious dessert-y mix. The popcorn itself is fluffy but not very flavorful, so the predominant profile is of the rich chocolate, super sticky caramel, and nuts. When my teenage sweet tooth comes calling, this is just what it craves. Bonus points if you get a bag that\u2019s just one blob glued together with caramel. $25 at Harry & David Buy\n\nThe underground favorite\n\nPop! Gourmet Popcorn Sriracha Popcorn, 4.5oz Even if it doesn\u2019t taste like Sriracha per se, this delivers the perfect level of spice with a hint of sweetness. It also pairs great with a dry white wine (no, I\u2019m not kidding at all). It\u2019s addictive but nearly impossible to find in the few stores that stock it \u2014 my local supplier Brooklyn Larder is almost always sold out. Luckily, there are online retailers that have you (and me) covered. $15 at Walmart Buy\n\nThe \u201chealthy\u201d crowd pleaser\n\nLesser Evil Popcorn Jalapeno + Honey, 5oz - Pack of 5 This was a sad-day bodega discovery and I regret nothing. It\u2019s low calorie, low sugar, and fatty only because of the inclusion of (reportedly good for you) coconut oil. The organic honey, Himalayan salt, and jalape\u00f1o-pepper powder all mix in to become one cohesive salty-sweet flavor bomb. The best endorsement I can give is that it solved my problems as only a good food can, and it also seems to be carried in 80 percent of New York grocery stores. If you\u2019re really looking to stock up, Amazon also sells a 12-pack of the 5oz bags for $52. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nPopcorn to impress your friends\n\nPop Art Nori Sesame Popcorn, 4.5oz This is the popcorn I reserve for special occasions. Like Dijon mustard or wine that costs above $9 a bottle, if I bring this out for you then you know we\u2019re getting fancy. Made with toasted seaweed and sesame seeds, this popcorn has an earthy sea flavor that I would (inexpertly) compare to that of uni. $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe blank canvas\n\nThe Chicago flavor that sounds awful but somehow works\n\nGarrett Classic Mix I spent one hellish year living in Chicago after college and though much of my life was a mess, it wasn\u2019t a total loss since I discovered the tourist trap/popcorn mecca that is Garrett. As much as I wanted to hate the kind of Frankenstein food abomination that could only come from the frozen shores of Lake Michigan, the cheddar/caramel mix is perversely perfect. It feels like you\u2019re doing something fiendish combining the powerfully different flavors in one bite but from a city full of food faux pas it\u2019s oh so right. From $33 at Garrett Buy\n\nG.H. Cretors Popcorn The Mix, 7.5oz - Pack of 12 I\u2019ve tried a lot of similar mixes, and while the Chicago authenticity of Garrett is superior, it\u2019s also pretty pricey. If you\u2019re looking for a cheaper option that still delivers taste-wise, this G.H. Cretors mix on Amazon works out to less than $3.50 a bag. $39 at Amazon Buy $39 at Amazon Buy\n\nTwo breakfast popcorns\n\nPopcorn for breakfast? Yes, I\u2019ve done it and I\u2019ll do it again. The delightfully named Poppingtons makes a variety of flavors to get a balanced meal in before work. The Cinnamon Kettlecorn tastes exactly like Cinnamon Toast Crunch and the Maple Caramel Bacon Cheddar mix is the perfect compliment to a plate of eggs. Or, you know, eat either at a normal time as a snack.\n\nAnd two popcorns I want to try\n\nPop! Gourmet Popcorn Black Truffle Popcorn, 3oz The makers of my beloved Sriracha popcorn have a lot more flavors in their arsenal. I\u2019ve heard great things about the earthy black-truffle variety that offers the flavor of an ingredient typically found on pricey tasting menus at a relatively affordable price. $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nGary Poppins Popcorn White Cheddar Jalape\u00f1o, 4oz - Pack of 4 I would buy this on the adorable name only, but I\u2019m also curious to try it for what I hear is a relatively spicy jalape\u00f1o flavor (most manufacturers have a light spice hand). Reviews are glowing across the board. Delightful British nanny unfortunately not included. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
