Trump asked for an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nThe President: \u201cThe other thing. There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nIn this passage of the reconstructed call transcript, Mr. Trump pushed the new Ukrainian president to get his country\u2019s prosecutor to open an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his younger son, Hunter Biden. In May, Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor had said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens to investigate.\n\nWhen he was vice president, Mr. Biden had pushed the Ukrainian government in 2015 to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was widely seen as an obstacle to reform because he failed to bring corruption cases. At the time, Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, that was the subject of an investigation that Mr. Shokin\u2019s office had long left dormant.\n\nIn 2018, the former vice president talked about his effort to get Mr. Shokin removed \u2014 carrying out the Obama administration\u2019s policy \u2014 at a Council on Foreign Relations event, and Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have used a brief video clip from those remarks as part of their insinuations that Mr. Biden was trying to protect Burisma Holdings from prosecution. Mr. Biden did not portray his effort to get Mr. Shokin out as stopping any prosecution of Burisma Holdings.\n\n2. Trump alluded to American aid, while not explicitly linking his request to unfreezing it, the document shows.\n\nThe President: \u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.\u201d\n\nAt the time of this call, Mr. Trump was holding back hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine that Congress had appropriated to help that country fend off Russian aggression. The reconstructed transcript does not directly refer to Mr. Trump\u2019s freezing of the aid or whether he would unfreeze it. However, it says Mr. Trump referred to large-scale American assistance to Ukraine in the above passage, and several sentences later, Mr. Trump added:\n\nThe President: \u2026 \u201cbut the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal, necessarily, because things are happening that are not good. But the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe next thing Mr. Trump did \u2014 after Mr. Zelensky responded to this statement by thanking Mr. Trump for his support \u201cin the area of defense\u201d and saying Ukraine was \u201cready to continue to cooperate for the next steps,\u201d such as by buying American missiles \u2014 was to ask for investigations as a \u201cfavor.\u201d", "description": "A reconstructed transcript showed President Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, and a Justice Department memo added new details about a whistle-blower\u2019s concerns.", "authors": ["Charlie Savage", "Adam Goldman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/us/politics/25dc-transcript-takeaways/25dc-transcript-takeaways-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
