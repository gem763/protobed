In London, mining stocks like Glencore (LON: ), Anglo American (LON: ) and Rio Tinto (LON: ) are in the red on the back of disappointing trade data from China over the weekend. Chinese imports declined by 5.6%, and that suggests that demand is cooling, and that hit natural resources stocks as the country is a major importer of commodities.\n\nThe European Central Bank meeting is on Thursday, and there is wide speculation about a loosening of monetary policy, so a sense of optimism is likely to swirl around the markets on the run up to the meeting.\n\nLloyds (LON: ) shares are lower this morning as there was a \u2018significant spike\u2019 in the number of customers calming compensation for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI).\n\nThe bank is the worst offender in relation to PPI provisions, as it has already set aside over \u00a319 billion, and today it confirmed it will set aside an additional \u00a31.2-\u00a31.8 billion. The bank has suspended its share buyback scheme on account of new PPI provision, and that added to the negative move. The cut off to claim compensation for PPI was August, so it is possible a line should now be drawn under this situation. The update from Llloyds wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise given that last week Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (LON: ) and CYBG PLC (LON: ) revealed PPI provisions.\n\nAssociated British Foods (LON: ) issued a mixed trading update. It\u2019s the same old story at the group, whereby Primark is the driver of the firm and the sugar unit underperforms. Primark\u2019s increased selling space slightly offset the 2% decline in like-for-like (LFL) sales. It is concerning that Primark registered a dip in LFL sales as it has been one of stronger firms in the fashion industry in recent years. The group full-year outlook was left unchanged.\n\nThomas Cook (LON: ) shares are lower as a fresh dispute over pensions has erupted. China\u2019s Fosun are on the verge of rescuing the troubled travel firm in exchange for a 75% stake in the tour business, and a 25% holding in the airline operation, but trustees of the travel firm\u2019s pension\u2019s scheme want reassurances that annual contributions of \u00a325 million will be maintained.\n\nBerkeley Group (LON: ) received an upgrade from HSBC as the bank issued a buy rating for the stock, and the previous rating was hold. The finance house also raised the price target to 4,540p from 4,130p.\n\nis higher on the day on the back of some positive economic updates from the UK today. The UK estimate for July was 0.3% on a monthly basis, and that easily topped the 0.1% forecast. The industrial output and manufacturing output for July came in at 0.1% and 0.3% respectively.\n\nWe are expecting the to open 49 points higher at 26,846 and we are calling the up 8 point at 2,986.\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
