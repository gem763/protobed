The Autopilot follows the car owner's phone GPS or a specific pinpoint on a map and drives towards them while navigating around obstacles, within a maximum distance of 200 feet.\n\nTesla drivers have started to test out the Version 10 software Smart Summon feature and found that their cars seemed to get confused by passing pedestrians, nearly got into accidents, and in some cases crashed into other vehicles or garages\n\nThis Tesla owner from Frisco, Texas tested out the Summon feature in a parking lot. His red Model 3 Tesla pictured above\n\nLeaving the parking lot the red Tesla failed to yield to incoming traffic and nearly crashed into this white vehicle above\n\nTesla owner David Guajardo tried the Summon feature on his blue Model 3 car and it bumped into another vehicle exiting a parking space, leaving the Tesla with front bumper damage because it failed to yield\n\nAftermath: Guajardo followed up sharing these pictures showing damage to the fog lights\n\nSoday 1 with V10 Smart Summon was working beautifully. But someone didn\u2019t notice my M3 and made a front bumper damage. We will claim our insurances but who\u2019s fault do you guys think it\u2019ll be ?

David F Guajardo captioned his video testing out the new feature on Twitter.\n\nHe shared photos showing the scratches and dents suffered in the brief bump.\n\n'It\u2019s hard to notice in these pictures but yes, it is damaged including the fog lights,' he captioned his damage photos.\n\nAnother man took to Twitter to show his test in Frisco, Texas.\n\nThe video shows him summon his red Tesla Model 3 from a parking lot across the street as he watches on.\n\nThe car seamlessly navigates out of its spot and the parking lot, but when its time to cross the main street it fails to yield to a passing car with the right of way. The Tesla doesn't stop until the other vehicle comes to a screeching halt.\n\n'Be forewarned @Tesla @elonmusk Enhanced summon isn\u2019t safe or production ready. Tried in my empty drive way. Car went forward and ran into the side of garage. Love the car but saddened,' the Twitter user said sharing the photo on Friday\n\nThis Twitter user says her Tesla turned into a golf cart when she engaged the Summon feature\n\nDriver Roddie Hasan shared the video on Twitter with the caption: 'So, @ElonMusk - My first test of Smart Summon didn't go so well.'\n\nAnother user shared a picture of their badly dented blue Tesla Model 3 that got hit while using the Summon function.\n\n'Be forewarned @Tesla @elonmusk Enhanced summon isn\u2019t safe or production ready. Tried in my empty drive way. Car went forward and ran into the side of garage. Love the car but saddened,' the Twitter user said sharing the photo on Friday.\n\nOne user uploaded video to YouTube testing out the feature and showing the black Model 3 smart car get confused by passing traffic and pedestrians along the way.\n\nHowever not all Summon test drives were failures. For many Tesla owners the feature worked seamlessly. However challenges tend to come when it's dark outside.\n\nTesla says that the Smart Summon is best used in well-lit and less busy areas like private parking lots and driveways\n\nEven Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that parking lots are a 'remarkably hard problem' to solve in a previous interview\n\n'Smart Summon is designed to allow your car to drive to you (using your phone\u2019s GPS as a target destination) or a location of your choosing, maneuvering around and stopping for objects as necessary. Like Summon, Smart Summon is only intended for use in private parking lots and driveways,' Tesla explained in release notes for the update.\n\n'You are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at times within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful around quick moving people, bicycles, and cars,' it added.\n\nEven Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that parking lots are a 'remarkably hard problem' to solve in a previous interview.", "description": "Tesla debuted its Version 10 software with its new Smart Summon feature last week, which allows drivers to automatically beckon their cars from a distance - but some drivers say it's a bust.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/22/19127600-0-image-a-110_1569879568976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
