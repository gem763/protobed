Mrs Turton told the inquiry she had concerns over the Factor VIII they had been using for their son.\n\nShe added: 'The pain of reliving what happened to Lee is nothing compared to the pain and suffering that he had in his short life.\n\n'We lost our beautiful son and brother, as did so many parents. We listen to MPs shouting about fearing for their safety, haemophiliacs were fearing for their lives and the safety of the Factor VIII they were using.\n\nLee Turton (pictured above) died when he was just 10-years-old from Hep C and HIV\n\nLee (pictured above) was shunned from his school once it was found that he was living with HIV\n\n'The Government knew the Factor VIII being used was infected, as did the pharmaceutical companies, and did nothing.'\n\nThe inquiry was shown a moving video of Lee's last Christmas before the pair were given a standing ovation after their evidence.\n\nA timeline of the contaminated blood scandal which began in the early-1970s 1972: NHS starts importing large batches of Factor VIII products from United States to help clot blood of haemophiliacs. 1974: Some researchers warn that Factor VIII could be contaminated and spreading hepatitis. Late-1970s: Patients continue to be given Factor VIII, with much of the plasma used to make the product coming from donors such as prison inmates, drug addicts and prostitutes. 1983: Governments in both the UK and the United States are told that Aids has been spread through blood products. Mid-1980s: By now the blood products such as Factor VIII, were being heat-treated to kill viruses, but thousands of patients had already been infected. 1991: Blood products imported from US are withdrawn from use. The government awards ex-gratia payments to haemophiliac victims threatening to sue. 2007: Privately-funded inquiry into scandal set up by Lord Archer of Sandwell but it does not get offical status and relies on donations. 2008: Penrose Inquiry launched, but victims claim the seven-year investigation was a 'whitewash'. 2017: Independent inquiry into contaminated blood scandal announced by Prime Minister Theresa May. April, 2019: Infected Blood Inquiry starts hearing evidence.\n\nAfter Lee died the family said they discovered he had also contracted hepatitis C, the inquiry heard.\n\nMrs Turton told the inquiry that the family had decided to move to Cornwall after it was leaked to the press and his school that Lee had HIV.\n\nShe said that parents had not wanted her son at the school and one teacher had said they would not teach Lee and her son was left isolated.\n\nShe added: 'He [Lee] wasn't invited to friends, he wasn't invited to parties, which was very hard not only for him but for his sister.\n\n'So we decided to move from the area to look after him the best we could without anybody knowing who he was.'\n\nThe couple said their son had been a 'happy little boy', and Mr Turton added: 'He was a bright, intelligent child, joking, always joking.'\n\nBut the inquiry heard that from around 1988 Lee's health began to go downhill and he had problems walking, breathing and eating and eventually had to be fed through a tube.\n\nMrs Turton said: 'He couldn't walk far, he couldn't breathe, he couldn't eat, he was eventually fed through a tube.\n\n'It was just infection after infection, we spent most of the time in and out of hospital with him.'\n\nMrs Turton told the inquiry that in January 1992 they had found Lee on the bathroom floor fitting and he was rushed to hospital.\n\nThe family were told Lee had between two and 10 days to live and he died eight days later on January 22 1992.\n\nMrs Turton said: 'When we got back to Cornwall they actually told us he had between two and 10 days to live.\n\n'They said he had an infection on the brain, so we insisted he went home that day because that's what he wanted to do, he kept asking, so we took him home.\n\n'He died on the eighth day.'\n\nMr and Mrs Turton said it was in 1988 that Lee's health began to go downhill and he had problems walking (Lee is pictured above)\n\nLee's condition started to deteriorate in 1988, the couple said. He began to lose his appetite and was 'always ill'\n\nThe contaminated blood scandal has been labelled the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.\n\nThousands of patients were infected with HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. Around 2,400 people died.\n\nThe inquiry is chaired by former High Court judge Sir Brian Langstaff who at the beginning of the evidence session reiterated his promise to put people at the heart of the probe.\n\nHe said there was still time for witnesses to come forward and added: 'If you have given a witness statement, and would like to be heard, do not, please, think at the end of this set of hearings that you have lost any chance of that.\n\n'I promised to put people who have been infected, or affected by the suffering of others, not only first but also last. There is time.'", "description": "Lee Turton died in 1992 when he was just 10-years-old and his parents have claimed MPs 'did nothing', the Blood Inquiry in London heard today.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19444422-0-image-a-61_1570541821703.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
