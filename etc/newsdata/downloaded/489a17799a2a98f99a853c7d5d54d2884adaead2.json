THR didn\u2019t identify any of the people by name so they could speak freely, but reactions range from glowing predictions that the film could win Best Picture to people worried the film sends a dangerous message. Here\u2019s a sample:\n\nMale: \u201cI think it\u2019s brilliant. Phoenix has never been better. The way he and the filmmakers handle the transformation from Arthur into Joker is nuanced and masterful.\u201d\n\nFemale: \u201cI saw the film last night at the Landmark with another Academy member, and my stomach was still churning this morning. It made me uncomfortable from the very first frame to the last, but I thought the movie was extraordinary\u2026It\u2019s still early, but I can certainly see myself nominating it for best picture. And he has to get nominated, or the actors branch doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nMale: \u201cAll of Todd Phillips\u2019 films are impeccably made. But I deeply despise the movie. It made me feel really uncomfortable. I love [Darren] Aronofsky, [Lars] von Trier, [Michael] Haneke and most movies that really push the boundaries of darkness. But there was a nihilism and narcissism to this movie that left a bunch of us feeling really disturbed, and we had to drink away our discomfort.\u201d\n\nMale: \u201cWe have problems in our society. I don\u2019t think this film is going to exacerbate those problems. Nor will the elimination of guns solve our problems. We have to work on our society, in general. My mantra these days is that it\u2019s not about diversity, it\u2019s about celebrating the commonalities of our humanity, those qualities all human beings share. That\u2019s right out of Martin Luther King\u2019s book.\u201d\n\nFemale: \u201cGreat performance and impressive filmmaking, but a rather unpleasant experience overall.\u201d\n\nMale: \u201cAs a former exhibitor, I would have serious doubts about playing the film because of the message it sends. I don\u2019t think the Academy should honor a film with such controversial elements.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s actually more variety among the group than I would have suspected. Everyone seems to agree it\u2019s beautifully photographed and well made and nearly everyone seems to think Joaquin Phoenix is a shoo-in to be nominated for Best Actor. But a surprising number of people THR contacted said they hadn\u2019t seen the film, some because of the controversy:\n\nMale: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet. I intend to, for sure. I am aware that some Academy members may not see the film or, if they do, won\u2019t be that receptive to it, despite its critical acclaim and popularity. So what else is new? By the way, in my view the controversy appears to be mainly in the press and on social media. I doubt that many Academy members are as invested in this controversy as journos and Oscar pundits are.\u201d\n\nFemale: \u201cYou know what they say \u2014 \u2018the unconscious can\u2019t tell the difference between a movie and real life\u2019 \u2014 so I limit what I subject myself to.\u201d\n\nMale: \u201cI am incredibly anxious to see the film, but I wasn\u2019t anxious to see it in its first weekend, mainly because of all the coverage of whether there might be some threat against theaters. Obviously, it had no impact, thankfully.\u201d\n\nFemale: \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m a bit nervous to go into a theater to see it, but I do plan on seeing it sometime in the near future.\u201d\n\nI think the first reaction about the controversy mostly being a creation of the press is correct. On that note, I\u2019ve lost count of the number of negative opinion pieces CNN has run at this point. Here\u2019s a bit of the one they ran Sunday:\n\nWhile many reviewers have focused on Fleck as an \u201cincel\u201d hero \u2014 his status as a sexless loner who turns to violence \u2014 the true nature of the movie\u2019s appeal is actually broader: It\u2019s an insidious validation of the white-male resentment that helped bring President Donald Trump to power\u2026 It draws from the same well of resentment that Trump strums with his racist rhetoric at his rallies \u2014 the fear of no longer being at the center of the political, social and cultural universe, with everyone who isn\u2019t you positioned at its perceived edges.\n\nCNN ran a \u201cbox-office analysis\u201d piece yesterday which was similarly negative:\n\nDespite hand-wringing about the movie \u2014 and doubtless in part, because of it \u2014 \u201cJoker\u201d opened to an estimated $96 million in North America \u2014 a record box-office haul for the month of October \u2014 and $235 million worldwide. Those results prompted inevitable headlines about \u201cJoker\u201d overcoming the naysaying and laughing all the way to the bank. Still, the fact that the opening weekend was thankfully uneventful doesn\u2019t eliminate concerns about what the movie represents. And using the cloak of \u201cThis is art\u201d in response reflects a kind of arrogance, as well as myopia about the wider context that fueled the controversy.\n\nThe title of that piece is \u201c\u2018Joker\u2019 is the latest case of commerce masquerading as art\u201d but the author, who is a media and entertainment writer for CNN, seems to be at odds with quite a few Oscar voters who found the film to be extremely well made even if it made them uncomfortable.", "description": "\"I don't think the Academy should honor a film with such controversial elements.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joker.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
