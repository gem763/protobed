And, say \u2014 take a pension fund, people need to get their money in 20 or 30 years, climate change poses a question of, will people get that money then? And how will the fund be affected?\"\n\nGoldman last month released a 34-page report, which analyzed the impact of climate change on cities. The results were terrifying. Read more about it here.\n\nGoldstein said clients want to be able to plan for changes that will arise due to climate change, whether it be physical changes, market moves, or policy, and added that more often clients are coming to Goldman for expertise on how to manage the risks associated with climate change.\n\n\"It's why we've put in a lot of time and money into research on ESG, as we don't want to approach it with an ad-hoc fashion,\" Goldstein said. \"This something we need to plan for in terms of managing risk, or driving growth, or is it something we can use to drive resilience across a portfolio.\"\n\nThe Goldman exec added: \"We see this as an opportunity to unlock economic growth.\"\n\nAnd it's not just Goldman Sachs.\n\n\"Climate change is affecting everyone and everything, so it would be unexpected not to find such effects in markets and business models,\" a UBS spokesman told Markets Insider.\n\n\"Markets are often driven by human behaviour.\" As a result, cultural milestones such as activist protests in the last year, including those by the Extinction Rebellion, as well as 2019 climate documentaries by David Attenborough ,are \"important in making it more likely that the issues of climate change and inequality will affect markets.\"\n\nJPMorgan agreed that this year was a critical one for investors when it comes to ESG, as it released an investing note in May, titled \"Climate changes everything\":\n\n\"2018, 2019 will be remembered as watershed years for climate change awareness,\" a note released by the bank in May said. \"Weather- and environment-related events have convinced the public and policymakers that global warming is not a risk, but a reality.\"\n\nIn the note, it highlighted that \"sustainable investing does not have to sacrifice returns, and may be of growing importance.\"\n\nUBS backed this up by crunching the numbers on the economic impact of a heating globe, something that its spokesperson was keen to highlight it has been researching for a decade.\n\nFrom a note in April, researchers found that if the temperature increased by just 4 degrees Fahrenheit, US GDP would drop 2%. If it went up 8 degrees, then 4% would be lost.", "description": "\"2018, 2019 will be remembered as watershed years for climate change awareness,\" says JPMorgan.", "authors": ["Yusuf Khan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da09f664af9093f2e4edb52?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
