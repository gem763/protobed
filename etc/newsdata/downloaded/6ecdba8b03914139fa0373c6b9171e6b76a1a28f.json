Output shrank in the second quarter when businesses found themselves holding unnecessary stock that had built up before the original leaving date of March 29.\n\n\"With Brexit cited as the biggest risk businesses face, the last quarter has also seen heightened concern over slowing growth in the UK and Eurozone and CFOs are tightening their purse strings in response,\" Stewart said.\n\nThe report said the resulting uncertainty was now entrenched, while domestic economic factors such as weak productivity and competitiveness are a growing concern.\n\nWith weak demand in Britain becoming the second biggest risk facing companies, expectations of an interest rate cut are also growing.\n\nThe fate of Britain's departure from the EU will become clearer in the next three weeks, ahead of the new Brexit deadline of October 31.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit by that date. The world's fifth largest economy will either leave with a transition deal, ask for a further delay, or leave without a deal, a move that will likely spark huge economic disruption.\n\nDeloitte said the combined market value of the 70 UK-listed companies surveyed was 468 billion pounds ($589bn) or approximately 19 percent of the UK quoted equity market. The survey also included some of the biggest unlisted companies in the UK.", "description": "Political uncertainty caused by Brexit and weak economic growth are the key concerns of British CFOs, Deloitte found.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/3/e6b2f8a574644c3f893ee934ab9f15aa_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
