They are standing up for their rights. At 93, I can only be with them in spirit. But my words are on their lips \u2014 and I am singing with them, too.\u201d", "description": "\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" has become an unofficial anthem of protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Overnight Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6f341e2500008d00025bcf.jpeg?cache=qjkanozbls&ops=1778_1000"}
