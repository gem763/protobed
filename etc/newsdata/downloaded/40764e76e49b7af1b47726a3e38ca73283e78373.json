'For this series we're travelling along the Ganges, Yangtze and the Nile, dipping in and out of interesting and sacred places along the way.'\n\nIn search of adventure: Simon has circumnavigated the globe multiple times for his varying travel series\n\nThe world's holiest city for Hindus, Varanasi has certainly impressed the adventurer.\n\n'It is pretty extraordinary. Beautiful, ancient, dirty, joyous, upsetting - the intensity of life in India is taken up to level 11. We were just filming the cremation area on the river earlier, they were constantly bringing new bodies along, limbs were falling off as the bodies were burned, it's gruesome, but incredible.'\n\nA long-time traveller, who spent plenty of time backpacking from place to place before he discovered that he could make travel his living, Simon is also working with Lastminute.com to encourage people to travel more spontaneously.\n\nSo does he live by his own advice?\n\n'I have a young son, so I'm almost required to be spontaneous. We're not beholden to school holidays at the moment, just to his mood, so we have to remain completely adaptable.\n\n'But in the past I managed to be more spontaneous. I can remember one trip in which I turned up at Stansted Airport with two friends planning to buy tickets to Spain. Somehow we decided to go to Copenhagen instead and when we turned up it was freezing cold, three of us didn't have coats, two of us were wearing flip flops. It was a comedy of muppetry and errors. But one of the most pleasurable experiences in life is a proper adventure with mates, being cast into a foreign land, there's a lot to be said for it.'\n\nOf course, there must limits to heading off on a whim to explore a new destination. While Simon may be willing to turn up under-dressed in Denmark, where does he draw the line when it comes to planning an impulsive but safe independent trip?\n\n\n\nIndian experience: The star is currently filming in the sacred Hindu city of Varanasi\n\nChaotic scenes: Hindu pilgrims visit Varanasi to bathe in the Ganges river\n\n'The first thing I'd say is never arrive late in the afternoon, you really need to get there with plenty of time to have a look around and decide where to stay.\n\n'Secondly, d on\u2019t get too hung up on review sites, most of them talk cobblers. Don\u2019t follow the crowd, trust people, but not too much, and when things go wrong, remember those are some of the most memorable times you can have. Things rarely go catastrophically wrong, normally they just provide an opportunity for you to soak up life where you are, in a way that you can\u2019t get in a western-run hotel.'\n\nThe importance of creating your own experience is key, says Simon.\n\n\n\n'Try to make your own itinerary. I'm not advocating ditching the guide book, they are absolutely invaluable for information. But sometimes with guides, it's a case of the tail that wags the dog. People follow its advice rather than their own instincts and desires - it\u2019s a reference book not a religious text to follow to the letter. '\n\nIt seems Simon has strong opinions on the use of guidebooks.\n\n'Many years ago, in a relationship I was in the early stages of having, I went back to this girl's house and was looking at her bookshelf. There was any number of guidebooks, endlessly marked up with those sticky page highlighters, the books were covered. I think I decided then that she wasn't right for me. I fear of that type of travel, \"we will go to this place this place this place\".\n\n\n\n'Although, of course, there is a balance between casting caution to the wind and rocking up in Paris at 1.30am with nowhere to stay and planning an adventure three years in advance. '\n\nUnspoilt: Laos is one of Simon's recommendations as it is still unblemished by mass tourism\n\nThanks largely to his voyages off the beaten track - in 2003, his series Meet the Stans explored Central Asia, and in 2005, Places That Don't Exist saw him visiting unrecognised nations, such as Somalia, Azerbaijan and Trans-Dniester, where he was arrested for 'spying' - he has become a bit of a pin-up for independent travellers.\n\nSo for those who, like Simon, enjoy nothing more than grabbing a backpack, travelling light and heading off into the unknown, what are the top destinations to visit this year?\n\nAfrican gem: Mozambique, with its wildlife and spotless islands, is Simon's hot tip\n\n' What has fascinated me about people\u2019s adventures is that in the past, people were happy to go to Macchu Picchu and the outer reaches of Thailand, but now people want to go further than that. The opportunities we have now are extraordinary.\n\n\n\n'Laos is one place I'd suggest. It\u2019s very unspoilt and people rightly associate that with a lack of facilities eg indoor toilets but for those willing to experience a few minor hardships for a greater trip, it's worth it.\n\n\n\n'I also think Mozambique is extraordinary, it has a really wonderful vibe. It used to get vast numbers of visitors until the civil war but now it is slowly on the up. My mind and heart are constantly drawn back to Africa, it's an extraordinary continent offering a rich mix of experiences and generally people are not put off by negative stories.'\n\nBut Simon is also keen to get away from the belief that you have to get as far as possible to have an adventure.\n\n\n\n'You can have exciting and memorable experiences close to home. I am rather taken by the idea that you take a glass, upturn it on a map of your area then draw ring around rim. Then explore that circle so you know it like back of hand. It's all too easy to travel other side of earth and not know your home area. Our island has a lot going for it, it is stunningly beautiful.'\n\nBut for now it is back to filming Sacred Rivers and the colourful scenes along the Ganges.\n\nNowhere like home: He may have visited more than 90 countries, but Simon also loves exploring his local area\n\n' For those looking at making travel plans, I'd say do it now. I\u2019ve just seen bodies being cremated in Varanasi. Life is so short and people put big trips off, thinking they have got to highlight every page of a guidebook before they go. Just head out and have an adventure.'", "description": "The BBC presenter talks spontaneous travel, ridiculous trips he took as a youngster and his top recommendations for independent travel in 2014.", "authors": ["Sarah Gordon"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/23/article-2544668-1AE86DFC00000578-643_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-01-29"}
