The average level of all your gear contributes to an overall gear level, which gives you a rough idea of what kind of challenges you can take on.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft, the forthcoming raid mission is the only game content that will be locked behind a gear level limit, and enemies do not have a visible level attached\u2014just a skull noting that their gear level is significantly higher than yours, and you\u2019d better prepare for a tougher fight than usual.\n\nSome Ghost Recon players consider this antithetical to the franchise ethos, which is predicated on realistic, tactical play. \u201cOne shot, one kill\u201d is what, they say, people look to Ghost Recon for.\n\nTheir argument is that It\u2019s not supposed to matter what level your weapon is at or what kind of perks their character class has\u2014if your character sends a bullet to another one\u2019s head, that\u2019s all it should take. From a messaging standpoint, Ubisoft seems to agree.\n\nWhat gear looks like in the Breakpoint beta.\n\nIn a lengthy Q&A published the same day the beta went live, Ubisoft laid out its rationale for the RPG-style gear system, noting that it\u2019s not meant to detract from the series\u2019 brand of tactical shooting.\n\nFor human foes, higher levels just mean they\u2019ll spot you faster and be a little bit more lethal, taking an unspecified but slightly higher number of body shots before they go down.\n\n\u201cWhatever the human enemy level, you will always be able to eliminate them with a single headshot, as long as they are not wearing a helmet,\u201d the post reads, \u201cin which case you just need to land a shot once to remove it, and then a second time to take them down.\u201d\n\nThe operative word there is human. Breakpoint is set on a tech magnate\u2019s private island, and taking on a variety of autonomous drones is a big part of what goes on. It\u2019s also Breakpoint\u2019s out for having missions and areas that do scale based on gear level, although Ubisoft states that lower-level squads should still be able to take them on as long as they\u2019re ready for a challenge.\n\nTo which ... sure. You can also technically beat Dark Souls naked with a single club, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\n\nUbisoft\u2019s argument for implementing this system stems from user data that indicated most Wildlands players found a weapon they liked and stuck with it for almost the entire game. This new system, the company says, encourages players to swap out weapons regularly and see more of what the game has to offer.\n\nIt\u2019s nice on paper, but if Ghost Recon is the skill-based shooter that Ubisoft says it is, and the tactical fantasy players seem to want from it, then players sticking with a gun they\u2019re good at using seems a little bit like a problem that doesn\u2019t need solving.\n\nSimilarly, classes feel like an addition made for the sake of having another thing to add in post-release content, the way Operators are added to Rainbow Six Siege or Specialisations in The Division 2. It\u2019s not that they aren\u2019t fun\u2014I like having the option of being a medic or a heavy weapons expert, but that\u2019s also because I\u2019ve acclimated class systems after years of playing shooters with them.\n\nIf I think hard about it, there\u2019s nothing particularly Ghost Recon about how they\u2019re implemented here.\n\nDuring Kotaku\u2019s stream of the Breakpoint beta Thursday, I joked that Breakpoint is just \u201cevery game,\u201d full of moments that recall other (mostly Ubisoft) games. It has the gear and class system of The Division 2, the loose, intel-gathering quest structure first implemented in Wildlands and fleshed out in Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, and the aggressive post-release roadmap that\u2019s common to every major release these days.\n\nDespite these substantial changes, Breakpoint still feels tremendously satisfying to play. The trouble is that with its new class and gear systems, Breakpoint moves into fashionable areas of big-budget video games that aren\u2019t entirely simpatico with Ghost Recon\u2019s hardcore style. Figuring out how well developer intent meshes with player feedback is one of the purposes of beta tests like this \u2014 and it\u2019s almost certain that players will figure out how well this early version of Breakpoint aligns with what Ubisoft says the game is meant to be.\n\nHere\u2019s one thing I\u2019m certain of: Breakpoint\u2019s new gear makes Ghost Recon a much more compulsive game, appealing to the big dummy in me who loves seeing numbers go up. I don\u2019t have a problem with that, but there are also dozens of places where I can get that feeling any given week.
