Photograph: Monty Rakusen/Getty Images\n\nA Neanderthal spear has two main parts: a piece of flint for the point, and a stick for the shaft. These were attached with tar from birch bark, which Neanderthals probably extracted by placing a roll of bark on an open fire. In other words, they invented the world\u2019s first known glue around 200,000 years ago.\n\nTheir discovery led to the creation of other compound tools such as hoes and axes, which shaped the development of early human societies. Jump forward to today and adhesives, self-repairing fibre, graphene and other forms of material innovation allow us to achieve things that would have seemed unimaginable to our ancestors. So what research and development is going on behind laboratory doors?\n\nAdhesives\n\nIn 2017, a team of scientists and engineers from consumer and industrial goods company Henkel demonstrated that three grams of adhesive could effectively pull a 208-tonne freight train. Loctite HY 4070 \u2013 a hybrid adhesive that combines several technologies for improved bond strength, durability and curing speed \u2013 was used to fuse two locomotive cars together. The team behind the demonstration watched nervously as the train set off. Incredibly, the adhesive held.\n\nThe experiment showed that hybrid adhesives are not only strong, but can also withstand considerable shocks, friction and vibration. That makes them ideal for the automotive and aerospace sectors, where joints and seals need to be extremely durable. The fact that Loctite adhesives can replace welding also makes them an important tool for manufacturers that are \u201clightweighting\u201d their cars and planes \u2013 ie substituting heavy metal materials for carbon fibre, plastic and aluminium \u2013 which can improve fuel efficiency and the battery range of electrical vehicles, for example.\n\n\u201cIf you try to weld carbon fibre, you will not get very far,\u201d says Dr Kourosh Bahrami, corporate vice president at Henkel Adhesive Technologies. \u201cEven if you try to weld aluminium with steel, it will not work. And that\u2019s where adhesives come into play, because they enable you to bond multiple substrates. This not only counts for the manufacturing of industrial goods but also when it comes to maintenance and repairing.\u201d\n\nAdhesives also make smartphones safer to use. \u201cThe typical adhesives that are used in a smartphone provide additional functionalities beyond the bonding. Many solutions, for example, have thermal properties that insulate the battery or protect the device from overheating,\u201d says Bahrami.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leftover coffee grounds can be spun into yarn when combined with a polymer.

They\u2019re found in the sensor arrays that help self-driving cars to see what\u2019s around them. And Henkel\u2019s electrically conductive adhesives are also helping engineers create more efficient and reliable solar cells.\n\nFibres\n\nSynthetic fibres such as nylon, acrylic and polyester have transformed the clothing industry over the past 60 years. But the way these materials are produced and disposed of has far-reaching environmental impacts. Synthetic fabrics are a major source of microplastics pollution, for example, and many are made from fossil fuels such as oil and coal.\n\nNatural fibres aren\u2019t squeaky clean, either: cotton production uses a lot of pesticides and water, for instance. Researchers are therefore trying to develop more sustainable textiles from everything from waste pineapple leaves to leftover coffee grounds. A company called Singtex collects the latter from major coffee vendors, combines it with a polymer and spins it into yarn that can be used for outdoor wear and bedspreads.\n\nIn the future, your clothes may even be able to repair themselves. Tandem Repeat, an Early Bird winner of this year\u2019s Global Change award, has created a thermoplastic fibre that incorporates the self-healing characteristics found in squid genes. Fabrics created from these fibres also act as a glue, minimising the shredding of microfibres during washing.\n\nResearchers at Chalmers University of Technology have even developed a fabric that converts kinetic energy into electric power. It works better when it\u2019s wet, so one day your sweaty gym clothes could theoretically help to power your smartwatch.\n\nGraphene\n\nGraphene is the world\u2019s first 2D material, meaning it is comprised of a single sheet of atoms. More importantly, it has amazing strength, electrical conductivity and heat conductivity properties, which has led to it being called a \u201cmiracle material\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Graphene-enhanced products such as trainers, batteries and flexible displays are now hitting the market. Photograph: Mark Garlick/Getty Images\n\n\u201cGraphene can improve consumer products in two ways,\u201d says Dr Aravind Vijayaraghavan, reader in nanomaterials at the University of Manchester. \u201cFirst, by making existing products better, and second by enabling new kinds of products that currently don\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cFor example, graphene can make existing rubber and plastic products stronger and more durable, which has both performance and environmental benefits. Graphene can also enable things such as flexible displays, super-high-capacity batteries and high-efficiency water purification.\u201d\n\n\u2018Quietly, people were forging ahead\u2019: the evolution of 3D printing Read more\n\nTwo researchers at the University of Manchester, Prof Sir Andre Geim and Prof Sir Kostya Novoselov, were the first scientists to extract graphene from graphite, winning the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics for their work.\n\nSince their discovery, many of patents for graphene-based consumer products have been lodged, and some of these items are now beginning to appear on the market. For example, the footwear company Inov-8 has released a running shoe with graphene-enhanced rubber outsoles, which they claim are 50% stronger than standard rubber ones.\n\nBatteries\n\nMost of us have suffered the frustration of having our phone die in the middle of an important call. But in future the batteries that power our smartphones, and potentially our cars, could have much longer lifespans.\n\nSolid-state batteries are one of the most exciting areas of research, and a \u201cvery attractive long-term battery goal \u2013 one that would benefit the consumer electronics market,\u201d says Allan Paterson, head of programme management at the Faraday Institution.\n\nSolid state batteries are more stable and safer than the lithium-ion batteries that currently power most electronic devices, and their higher energy density means your laptop or smartphone would last for much longer between charges. \u201cIf deployed in electric vehicles, weight reductions and increased energy density would improve driving range and lower costs,\u201d says Paterson.\n\nSodium-ion batteries also show promise. Rather than lithium, which is relatively rare, they use salt, the sixth most common element on Earth \u2013 and could be up to seven times more efficient than current batteries.\n\nBut before you start dreaming of a smartphone that doesn\u2019t need charging every night, you should note that Paterson says: \u201cThere are still a number of complex challenges that need addressing to drive forward the next generation of battery technologies.\u201d", "description": "An enormous amount of innovation goes on behind the scenes in labs to make everyday items more efficient and sustainable.
