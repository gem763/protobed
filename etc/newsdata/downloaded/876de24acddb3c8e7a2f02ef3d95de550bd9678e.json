Of the injured, six had been treated and released, while three were still in the hospital, police said Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis was a cowardly act by an individual that didn\u2019t know how to deal with a conflict or disagreement that he was having with someone else,\u201d said Battiste. Choosing to recklessly discharge a gun in a crowded location is \u201cunacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nThe victims range in age from 15 to 18 years old.\n\n'People are on edge': Mass violence threats \u2013 at least 30 in 18 states \u2013 have surged since El Paso, Dayton\n\nWeeks since Gilroy, El Paso and Dayton: What if motives behind mass shootings never emerge?\n\nPolice were able to use surveillance video from the game, as well as multiple cell phone videos from the crowd, to identify Parnell. While he appears to be the only shooter, additional people are being questioned and more charges are not out of the question. Among those being questioned are several adults.\n\nPolice are investigating how Parnell got the gun into the stadium. The city-owned venue did not have metal detectors on Friday night, according to Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson.\n\nIn a news conference, Battiste cautioned people to be alert in public gatherings.\n\nIn a series of tweets Saturday morning, Stimpson thanked first responders for their quick actions.\n\n\"Today as we cover our City in prayer for the victims injured, I would like to thank our public safety teams for their rapid response to the senseless act of violence at Ladd Stadium,\" the mayor tweeted shortly before 7 a.m. Saturday. \"Our children and their families deserve to enjoy a high school football game or any public event without the thought of gun violence. As a community, we will heal. As a community, we have to get the guns out of the hands of our youth.\"\n\nStimpson vowed on Saturday morning to increase security and add additional security protocols at the nine venues in Mobile where high school football games are held.\n\nContributing: Charles Ventura and Joel Shannon, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pensacola News Journal: Alabama high school football game shooting: 9 attempted murder charges", "description": "Deangelo Parnell, 17, has been charged with nine counts of attempted murder\u00a0for allegedly opening fire Friday into a stadium in Mobile, Alabama.", "authors": ["Jake Newby", "Pensacola News Journal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PJKgbTPAPWly1U9w0HXhUw--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/efc064499c5f4c3aa14377c8bd242210"}
