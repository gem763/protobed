The feature has been in limited testing before today with select artists. When available, you don\u2019t just see the album artwork behind the player controls \u2014 you see a moving, visual experience that plays in a short loop.\n\nSo far, Canvas has had mixed reviewers from Spotify users. Some find the looping imagery distracting while others simply prefer seeing the album art. Some people seem to like the feature. But others only like it with certain content and artists.\n\nThe challenge is in designing a video loop that works well. That means it shouldn\u2019t be an attempt to try to lip sync to a part of a song. It shouldn\u2019t include intense flashing graphics or text, nor should it distract people from being able to see the player controls and track information.\n\nSpotify also suggests trying to tell a full story in the loop rather than just drastically trimming a music video down to the time allotted (3- or 8-second clips). Other recommended Canvas experiences are those that help develop the artists\u2019 persona across their profile and tracks, or those that are updated frequently. Billie Eilish, for example, uses the feature to share animated versions of fan art.\n\nSince launching, Canvas has been seen by millions of users, Spotify says. But the company seems to acknowledge the impact varies, based on how the Canvas is designed. When it works, it can \u201csignificantly increase\u201d track streams, shares, and artists page visits. But Spotify didn\u2019t say what happens when the feature fails to engage fans.\n\nHowever, based on social media discussions about the feature and how-to guides detailing how to turn the thing off, it would seem that some users choose to opt out of the experience entirely.\n\nToday, Spotify says Canvas will no longer be limited to select artists, as it\u2019s opening more broadly to artists in an expanded beta. With the beta, Spotify hopes artists will treat Canvas as a critical part of their release strategy, and will continue to use it across their catalog.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to get noticed and build a vision \u2014 and an excellent way to share more of who you are with your listeners, hopefully turning them into fans,\u201d the company writes in an announcement. \u201cThe goal is for you to have richer ways to express yourself and to allow listeners to engage with you and your music even more deeply. We\u2019re continuing to work on additional features, as well as more tools and metrics to help you better understand how your art is reaching your audience,\u201d the company says.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to comment on the timing of this launch. At the end of September, Google announced that YouTube Music would not be preinstalled on new Android devices, taking the place of Google Play Music. With YouTube Music, streamers gain access to a visually immersive experience where they can watch the music videos, not just listen to the audio, if they prefer.\n\nSpotify, however, has traditionally been a place to listen \u2014 not to watch. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t music videos on Spotify, they\u2019re just not well highlighted by the app nor a core part of the Spotify experience.\n\nThe company says it\u2019s now sending artists their invites to join the beta. Those who haven\u2019t received the invite can instead make a request to be added here.", "description": "Spotify is opening up its Canvas feature to more artists, the company announced this morning, which means you\u2019ll see a lot more of those looping videos on the app starting soon.
