This is not a free pass. It\u2019s acceptable and necessary to call for political figures who are accused of wrongdoing to resign from office, to demand that they be fired or dismissed, and to urge the electorate to not vote for them. Authoritarian regimes have a tendency to criminalize opposition or dissent; the taboo, in theory, helps prevent free societies from falling into the same habit.\n\nTrump, for his part, doesn\u2019t seem to care about political norms or taboos as a matter of principles. He invokes them when it suits him and violates them when it doesn\u2019t. He threatened to jail Hillary Clinton throughout the 2016 campaign, then claimed he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d when his own behavior during that election came under the Justice Department\u2019s scrutiny. He often describes the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry as a would-be coup d\u2019etat while demanding that California Representative Adam Schiff, that inquiry\u2019s lead figure, be arrested for treason. There is no intellectual or philosophical consistency at work here, only pure self-interest.\n\nWhen all other things are equal, it might be troubling for any crowd to chant that a political figure should be jailed. The problem is also whether elected officials encourage the chants and use them to justify their abuses of power, or whether they discourage it when given the chance. Andrew Scheer, the leader of Canada\u2019s Conservative Party, intervened earlier this month when a campaign rally in Ontario began chanting \u201clock him up\u201d while he criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \u201cWe\u2019re going to vote him out,\u201d Scheer told the crowd. \u201cVote him out! Vote him out!\u201d (Trudeau later won the election even though Scheer\u2019s party received the most votes.) Elizabeth Warren, one of Trump\u2019s potential Democratic rivals, also stopped a similar chant at a Nevada rally earlier this month aimed at a pro-Trump protester who disrupted it.\n\nAll things weren\u2019t equal during Sunday\u2019s burst of public outrage, even though observers like Scarborough thought they were. \u201cSo let\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got this straight: When crowds chant \u2018Lock her up\u2019 toward Hillary, it is illiberal and anti-American. (I agree),\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut when crowds chant the same toward Trump, it is suddenly a fulsome exercise of sacred First Amendment rights. What hypocritical clowns.\u201d Pro-Trump and anti-Trump crowds alike have the First Amendment right to chant \u201clock him/her up,\u201d of course. But the average crowd-goer can\u2019t actually lock anyone up. The president can.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a sign of creeping illiberalism; it was a mocking repudiation of it.\n\nDo Sunday\u2019s events normalize Trump\u2019s illiberal behavior? Context matters. Nobody orchestrated the \u201clock him up\u201d cheers among the crowd. They arose spontaneously at a sporting event where the president happened to appear, not at a political rally where one of his opponents sought to remove him from office. And they weren\u2019t directed at just any random public official. They were aimed at the president who\u2019s done more than anyone since Richard Nixon to defy the principle that the state\u2019s power to investigate and prosecute shouldn\u2019t be abused to destroy one\u2019s political opponents. This wasn\u2019t a harbinger of creeping illiberalism; it was a mocking repudiation of it.", "description": "The Beltway pundit set should, perhaps, take his baseball-fan opponents seriously, not literally.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/a01ed36457b6c7e68dd44fb7442d946ca3dac003.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
