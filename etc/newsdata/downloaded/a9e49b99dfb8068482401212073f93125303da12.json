They've got constituents back home that want to see action taken against Trump in a serious way so it comes down to this.\"\n\nPELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP\n\nHe called Pelosi's move a \"clever\" motion that protected the several dozen moderate members of her caucus in swing districts -- including those where Trump won in 2016.\n\n\"I think she thinking that she needs to be responsive to the needs of her caucus -- look at what she did today, it was really quite clever if you think about it,\" he said.\n\n\"Did she have a vote in the House to conduct an impeachment inquiry? No, she simply announced one. How is that substantively different from what her Judiciary chairman Jerrold Nadler did just a week or ten days ago?\"\n\nThe Fox News political analyst considered whether Pelosi was skillfully trying to quell fears among her more liberal members that impeachment is being taken seriously, while balancing the needs of her moderate members whose constituents may not be as fired up about the prospect.\n\n\"So as a matter of law and constitutional activity the question tonight is has anything really changed? Is this really an action or is this merely a gesture?\" he asked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"My sense about it is that it is merely a gesture as she continues to protect vulnerable members of her caucus from having to vote to go forward on impeachment.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, seven freshmen moderate Democratic House members threw their support behind the inquiry, including Reps.
