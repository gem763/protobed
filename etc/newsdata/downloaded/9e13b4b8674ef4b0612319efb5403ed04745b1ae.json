What has driven market sentiment negative concerning the cannabis industry has been the market's reaction to what is considered disappointing performances, when in reality it was inevitable that the high-flying cannabis sector went through a season of correction after soaring for a prolonged period of time.\n\nAfter exploding with huge multiples in the early stage of growth, companies are now settling down into a more reasonable growth trajectory, which while still being significant, will be much more subdued than in the past.\n\nThis is why the last earnings report for Charlotte\u2019s Web resulted in overreaction from the market, even though the company produced decent numbers.\n\nWhile missing on revenue by $2.78 million and earnings per share by $0.03, that was primarily because expectations were still so high, at a time when the company was entering into a more mature state of growth.\n\nA sign that its growth was starting to become more realistic was the fact it year-over-year growth was up only 45 percent to $25 million. Normally that would be a solid number, but when measured against some of its peers, it was fairly modest.\n\nOn the other hand, the company generated a gross margin of 75 percent, which produced $18.8 million in gross profits.\n\nAnother factor that could boost results is that the company increased the number of retail outlets it sold out of by 1926, finishing the quarter at 7871. The current quarter will give a better view of the impact on the company because it'll include a full quarter of results.\n\nGrowth catalysts\n\nThe major growth catalyst for Charlotte\u2019s Web is the CBD segment, which is projected to soar to $23.7 billion in annual sales by 2023, according to the Brightfield Group.\n\nIf the company is able to maintain its current market lead, it's going to account for long-term for many years. As competition heats up it may lose some of that share, but taking into account the expected growth in CBD, even a decline in market share would likely result in a significant increase in sales.\n\nOn the production side of the business, it increased the amount of acreage planted for 2019 by 862 acres, up 187 percent year-over-year.\n\nOther catalysts include the release of a new pet line in the last quarter, which at the time had twelve new SKU's. The company also has signed distribution deals with Krogers and CVS Health. It also launched a new line of CBD gummies with three SKU's.\n\nStory continues", "description": "As with most cannabis companies in the current correction, Charlotte\u2019s Web Holdings (CWBHF) has taken a big hit as sentiment for the sector remains negative.It's debatable how long the industry will remain down, but once it bottoms out, it's obvious that the stronger cannabis companies will rebound", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/loGu0wgmAN7E_vJPuNPpyA--~B/aD0zNDY7dz0xMDg2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/fb9d342d38508367cc1a38a0736346cc", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
