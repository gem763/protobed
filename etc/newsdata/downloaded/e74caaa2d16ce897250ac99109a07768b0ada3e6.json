Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential field\u2019s top tier, has faced a barrage of critiques in recent days from campaigns who often claim she has received a free pass from the media.\n\nMany of these attacks happen without ever mentioning Warren\u2019s name. Candidates \u2015 including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana \u2015 often talk about how Democrats need to have more than Warren\u2019s signature policy plans in order to win. A staffer for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) suggested Warren hadn\u2019t done enough to help Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms. (She donated $11 million to other candidates and progressive causes.)\n\nOthers have been more direct: The always-colorful, oft-quoted former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Biden surrogate, attacked Warren as a \u201chypocrite\u201d for touting her decision not to hold high-dollar fundraisers after holding them in the past.\n\nBut the attacks that could land the most damage focus on Warren\u2019s trustworthiness on health care, the No. 1 issue for voters in both the Democratic primary and in the general election, according to polling. Though Warren has rolled her out own detailed policy plans on everything from gun control to child care to rural economic development, she is the only leading candidate to avoid releasing her own health care plan, instead endorsing Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation while saying she remains open to alternatives.\n\nThe position has left her vulnerable to attacks from Sanders supporters as well as from opponents of Medicare for All, which would eliminate private health insurance and require the government to pay for Americans\u2019 health coverage. Warren\u2019s steady rise in the Democratic primary has come, in large part, from her ability to appeal to both the party\u2019s mainstream and left-wing branches, but health care is an issue that could turn chunks of both groups against her and undercut her central image as a candidate with a brilliant idea for every problem.\n\n\u201cI support Medicare for All. I think it\u2019s a good plan,\u201d Warren told CBS after the Sept. 12 Democratic debate in Houston when asked if she would roll out her own health care plan. But she quickly added: \u201cI support a lot of plans, other things that people have come up with it. When they\u2019re good plans, let\u2019s do it. This isn\u2019t some kind of contest, \u2018I got to think of mine first.\u2019 It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the American people.\u201d\n\nAfter the #DemocraticDebate @CHueyBurns asked @ewarren if she\u2019ll unveil a healthcare plan. Warren says \u201cI support Medicare for All\u201d adding \u201cWhen they are good plans, let\u2019s do it. This isn\u2019t some kind of contest...it\u2019s what is best for the American people\u201dpic.twitter.com/Z5pi4SAGGc \u2014 Musadiq Bidar (@Bidar411) September 13, 2019\n\nButtigieg, appearing on CNN on Thursday, noted that Warren has avoided explicitly stating if she would support higher taxes on middle-income earners of the kind needed to fund a single-payer system. Two days earlier, during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert was unable to pin Warren down on the need for higher taxes to fund Medicare for All. Warren instead stuck to her formulation that under her plan net \u201ccosts\u201d would go down for the vast majority of Americans because of the elimination of out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d Buttigieg said of Warren\u2019s refusal to directly answer Colbert\u2019s questions. \u201cI think that if you are proud of your plan and it\u2019s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms.\u201d\n\n(Buttigieg, who rolled out his own health care plan on Thursday, has said only that he would fund an expansion of health care coverage by closing corporate tax loopholes, without further details.)\n\nBiden echoed this line of attack during a Friday event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, suggesting Warren and Sanders were hiding the effect of Medicare for All. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Trump by not being straightforward about what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d he told a voter who questioned why he wasn\u2019t supporting Medicare for All.\n\nPete Buttigieg says Elizabeth Warren has been \u201cextremely evasive\u201d about how she'd pay for her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan.\n\n\n\nHe says his newly released health care plan wouldn't raise taxes on the middle class. \u201cIt does create a way for everybody to be covered\u201d https://t.co/cbWlRgMT02 pic.twitter.com/Xb4xugdjY9 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) September 20, 2019\n\nButtigieg, along with Biden and other moderate Democrats, has long argued that Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s stated preference for Medicare for All is politically unwise and would cause chaos for tens of millions of Americans with private health insurance. But the recent attacks have focused squarely on the question of tax increases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally dishonest, because for people\u2019s pocketbooks, Medicare for All will be a tax decrease, and the people saying this know that,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a prominent Warren backer. \u201cIt\u2019s an insurance company and Republican talking point.\u201d\n\nGreen also claimed Warren\u2019s \u201crefusal to take the bait\u201d was helping her with Democrats. \u201cRepublicans will inevitably make unfair attacks in the general election. We can\u2019t live in fear of that. But we don\u2019t need to give them Democratic validators.\u201d\n\nWarren is a relatively recent convert to single-payer, signing on to Sanders\u2019 legislation only in September 2017. Since then, she has continued to work on interim fixes to the private health insurance system. In March 2018, she backed legislation \u2015 co-sponsored by Sanders \u2015 designed to tighten regulations on private insurers and keep them in the Affordable Care Act exchanges. When she first began running for president, she discussed protecting Medicaid more than pushing for single-payer.\n\nBut at the first Democratic debate on June 27, she made her stance clear: She was \u201cwith Bernie on Medicare for All,\u201d including the elimination of private health insurance. Warren reiterated her stance in the two subsequent debates and an interview released earlier this month with dying progressive activist Ady Barkan. Barkan, who has his used his struggles with ALS to help illustrate the need for single-payer health care, specifically pressed her to explain her greater reluctance on the topic closer to the start of her campaign.\n\n\u201cThere are areas where markets just don\u2019t work and a big part of health care is one of those,\u201d Warren told Barkan. \u201cSo the idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will sort itself out is just not true with health care.\u201d\n\nOne advantage for Warren is that the National Nurses United union, a major institutional backer of Medicare for All that endorsed Sanders in the 2016 cycle, has not yet endorsed in the 2020 presidential primary. Asked whether the union considered Warren\u2019s stance adequate, NNU spokesperson Chuck Idelson would not respond directly, instead saying that if the union decides to endorse in the race, it will \u201ccertainly explain\u201d how the endorsement is \u201cconsonant\u201d with its priorities.\n\nBut Warren\u2019s remarks have failed to assuage left-wing Sanders supporters \u2015 many of whom are associated with the Democratic Socialists of America or Jacobin magazine \u2015 who don\u2019t think they can count on her to enact a policy they believe is the bedrock of a robust, contemporary welfare state. They point to small signals from Warren \u2015 her failure to give the plan a prominent place on her campaign website or to give it more than a passing mention in most of her speeches \u2015 as reasons to be skeptical.\n\nThe idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will sort itself out is just not true with health care. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\n\nNatalie Shure, a leading Medicare for All advocate and dues-paying member of the Boston chapter of the DSA, argued Thursday on the popular left-wing YouTube show \u201cThe Majority Report\u201d that Warren was not willing to \u201cfight tooth and nail for a robust, single-payer, Medicare for All health care system.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up interview with HuffPost, Shure said that Warren\u2019s unwillingness to explicitly embrace the need for middle-class tax hikes to fund Medicare for All is emblematic of her tepidness on the matter.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s simultaneously trying to tap into the activist energy and enthusiasm that activists have spent years building for single-payer and Medicare for All \u2026 without forfeiting any of the plausible deniability or the support of people who wouldn\u2019t want to go that far,\u201d Shure said.\n\nThat\u2019s a distinction from Sanders, who has staked his presidential run on the ability to galvanize a social movement \u2015 a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d \u2015 capable of at least generating momentum behind Medicare for All, according to Shure.\n\n\u201cShe looks at her role differently than a Sanders presidency would look at his role,\u201d Shure said. \u201cHe would lead a movement to get it, which I think is necessary for anyone who wants it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d veto it if it came to her desk. She might even whip votes for it. But I don\u2019t think she is going to reach outside of electoral politics for it.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Sanders stalwart who carried the single-payer bill in the House, put it more gently.\n\nWarren \u201chasn\u2019t eased up on it. She hasn\u2019t wavered, gotten weak in the knees,\u201d he said, referring to Warren\u2019s recent remarks affirming her support for the policy. \u201cBut I think it means something that Bernie carried the bill, wrote the bill and has been fighting for it even before it was a popular thing.\u201d", "description": "Warren is facing criticism from the left and center on voters\u2019 No. 1 issue: health care.", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8561e72100003400d55e41.jpeg?cache=ilwe8qyvts&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
