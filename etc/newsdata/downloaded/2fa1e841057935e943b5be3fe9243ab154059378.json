Oprah Winfrey, Spike Lee, Cicely Tyson, Samuel L. Jackson, Halle Berry and others all helped Perry christen his new facility, a 330-acre (134-hectare) studio that once served as a Confederate army base.\n\nWinfrey praised Perry and told the AP the new studio head is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\"He didn't wait for other people to validate or to say you should go this way or that way. He said I'm going to create my own way and as we can see here, become a force for himself,\" Winfrey said.\n\n\"I remember when he was thinking about buying this place and I said 'You'd be crazy not to take it.'\" she added.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson pointed to Perry's vision as the key to his ascent.\n\n\"This is more about Tyler the entrepreneur. The visionary. A guy who understands that ownership means that you can do what you want,\" Jackson said as he paused along the red carpet.\n\nTyler Perry Studios has 12 soundstages, each named after seminal black actors and actresses.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP Writer Ron Harris on : http://twitter.com/Journorati", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
