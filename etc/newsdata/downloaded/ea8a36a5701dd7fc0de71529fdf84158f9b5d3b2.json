Today, users are storing over 500 terabytes of data on the Sia network, the company claims.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Siacoin, ranked 72nd by market capitalization, jumped by 7% and trades at c. USD 0.001647 (15:32 UTC). It's up by 5% in the past 24 hours and is down by 9% in the past week.\n\nThe Sia network employs a two-token model: Siacoins are used to buy and sell cloud storage space while Siafund investors receive a small share of total storage revenue.\n\n\"Given that Nebulous had properly registered its 2018 offering of Siafunds in the wake of the SEC\u2019s 2017 guidance regarding digital assets, we were disappointed that the SEC chose to take action with respect to the relatively small offering conducted years before we had the benefit of that guidance,\" Zach Herbert, Nebulous Chief Operating Officer, was quoted as saying in the announcement by the company.\n\n_____\n\nBackground:", "description": "After EOS developer Block.one said it has settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, another blockchain project announced the same news today.", "authors": ["Linas Kmieliauskas"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/36fdabb417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
