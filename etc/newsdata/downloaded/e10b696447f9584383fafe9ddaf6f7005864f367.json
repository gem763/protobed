He pestered Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for help in recommending him for a Nobel Prize, according to an official familiar with the call\u2026\n\nIn a summer 2018 call with Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump harangued the British leader about her country\u2019s contribution to NATO. He then disputed her intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Putin\u2019s government had orchestrated the attempted murder and poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil.\n\n\u201cTrump was totally bought into the idea there was credible doubt about the poisoning,\u201d said one person briefed on the call. \u201cA solid 10 minutes of the conversation is spent with May saying it\u2019s highly likely and him saying he\u2019s not sure.\u201d\u2026\n\nAs a result, staff fretted that Trump came across ill-informed in some calls, and even oafish. In a conversation with China\u2019s Xi, Trump repeated numerous times how much he liked a kind of chocolate cake, one former official said. The president publicly described the dessert the two had in April 2017 when Trump and Xi met at the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort as \u201cthe most beautiful piece of chocolate cake you have ever seen.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Trumps-Calls-With-Foreign-Leaders-Have-Long-Worried-Aides-Leaving-Some-Genuinely-Horrified"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
