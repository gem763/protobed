As more such constellations arrive in space, the danger will be vastly increased and will not be able to solved by manoeuvring out of the way.\n\nThe move was forced after ESA's experts in space debris found that there was a high risk of collision between the two active satellites. They found that it would be safer for the ESA satellite, known as Aeolus, to increase its altitude so that it could fly over the dangerous constellation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star's mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star's core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. This type of object is called, somewhat confusingly, a planetary nebula, though it has nothing to do with planets. The name derives from the rounded, planet-like appearance of these objects in early telescopes\" - European Space Agency Nasa 2/10 Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

Soon after they had been calculated to potentially crash, the satellite phoned home as usual and send down the science data it had collected, assuring engineers that the collision had been avoided.\n\nAt the moment, ESA says such manoeuvres are very rare between active satellites. For the most part, satellites have to move out of the path of dead satellites or pieces left over from previous collisions.\n\nBut space agencies including ESA have repeatedly warned that megaconstellations such as those sent into space by Starlink could pose a vastly increased danger. Those constellations are projected to include thousands of satellites.\n\nWhen there is such a high degree of danger, it will become impossible for engineers to manually spot potential collisions and move satellites out of their way.\n\nInstead, ESA plans to make this process automatic, relying on artificial intelligence to move satellites out of danger.", "description": "The European Space Agency has had to perform its first ever \"collision avoidance manoeuvre\" to avoid one of its satellites smashing into a \"mega constellation\".
