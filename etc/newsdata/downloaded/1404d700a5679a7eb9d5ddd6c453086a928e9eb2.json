She said she believes Congress needs to act on a bill to place sanctions on Turkey given the gravity of their military incursion in northern Syria.\n\n\"I think that it's a grave mistake to put our security in the hands of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and [Syrian President Bashar] Assad and [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdo\u011fan. I think our retreat from northern Syria clearly enables the rise of ISIS, and ISIS is a direct threat to the homeland. And I think Turkey ought to face consequences, including through sanctions, for invading Syria,\u201d she told The Hill.\n\nCheney \u2014 who introduced a bill targeting the country\u2019s energy sector, barting the U.S. from selling arms to Ankara, and imposing sanctions on Turkish leaders \u2014 said she still needs to look into the bipartisan sanctions bill spearheaded by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelDemocrats say they have game changer on impeachment Paul blocks vote on House-passed Syria resolution for second time Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan MORE (D-N.Y.) and Foreign Affairs ranking member Rep.

But I do think it's very important for us to be clear that the Turkish invasion of Syria is something for which they've got to face consequences,\u201d Cheney said.\n\n\u201cAnd we need to stand with our allies, the Kurds, and we've got to ensure that we don't allow and enable the rise of ISIS and I'm very concerned that we're now in a situation where we put our security into the hands of our adversaries.\u201d\n\nRep.

I want to say that I applaud the president's efforts to make this a better situation than it was a week ago. But I'm not going to kid myself into thinking that I still agree with the actions taken,\u201d he told The Hill.\n\n\u201cSo, both things can be true, right. We need to be \u2014 we need to have a very close watch on what Turkey is doing. I'm glad to hear that he announced that [Trump] is leaving some special operations troops there, as he said, to protect oil fields. But I think more importantly than that we need those eyes and ears on the ground to understand what is happening in Syria with respect to ISIS and their possible resurgence and with respect to the supposed cease-fire that we're now hoping the Turks will abide by.\u201d\n\nWhile some said they feel Congress should move forward with a bill, other top Republicans said they believe the White House should continue to take the lead on the issue.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyThe Memo: Trump 'lynching' firestorm is sign of things to come McConnell: Trump lynching comment 'an unfortunate choice of words' White House spokesman: Trump didn't mean to compare his experience with 'darkest moments' in US history MORE (R-Calif.) said it\u2019s \u201cgood news that we've got a permanent cease-fire that shows the president was able to have a success.\u201d\n\nAnd House Minority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseMcCarthy on Trump's 'lynching' comparison: 'That's not the language I would use' House rejects GOP measure censuring Schiff This week: Tensions flare over Schiff, impeachment inquiry MORE (R-La.) said lawmakers have been working with the administration to ensure they have the tools needed to ensure terrorists are unable to escape Kurdish prisons, adding if additional sanctions are needed, he\u2019s confident Congress will act.\n\n\"If Turkey doesn't comply, [we want to see] does the administration have enough tools currently and if not, I think you'll see a very bipartisan group in Congress ready to put even tougher sanctions in place,\u201d he told The Hill.", "description": "Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cheneyliz_101619gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
