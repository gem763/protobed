They are a road map to the diminution of the United States.\n\nIn March, House Democrats voted to defend localities that allow illegal immigrants to vote in their elections. Only six Democrats voted against the measure. Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tx) stated to Fox News,\n\n\u201cWhat kind of government would cancel the vote of its own citizens, and replace it with noncitizens?\u201d\n\nFederal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections. If the Democrats do well in the 2020 election, that could be changed.\n\nThe cost of this strange tilt towards illegal aliens and away from the needs of U.S. citizens, particularly seniors and homeless veterans, was reviewed in 2016 by Federation for Immigration Reform study, which found that U.S. taxpayers about $113 billion a year at the federal, state and local level. The bulk of the costs \u2014 some $84 billion \u2014 are absorbed by state and local governments. Those figures cited have risen in the past several years.\n\nNot content with allowing noncitizens to vote, many prominent Democrats seek to allow convicted felons to cast ballots as well. The Hill reports that Senator Bernie Sanders (D-Vermont) wants to extend the vote even to the worst felons, still incarcerated. \u201cYou\u2019re paying a price, you committed a crime, you\u2019re in jail. That\u2019s bad,\u201d Sanders told The Hill. \u201cBut you\u2019re still living in American society and you have a right to vote.\u201d\n\nRep. Ilhan Oma r (D-Minn) told Fox News that she wants to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and have the United Nations supervise the U.S. southern border.\n\nDespite the rampant expense and the increase in crime (64% of federal arrests were of aliens) and the existence of many seniors and homeless veterans in need, some Democrat state officials, particularly in California, seem to put the needs of illegals first.\n\nA National Council on Aging study reports that,\n\n\u201cOver 25 million Americans aged 60+ are economically insecure\u2014living at or below 250% of the federal poverty level\u2026 These older adults struggle with rising housing and health care bills, inadequate nutrition, lack of access to transportation, diminished savings, and job loss. For older adults who are above the poverty level, one major adverse life event can change today\u2019s realities into tomorrow\u2019s troubles.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Council on Homeless Veterans, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates that 40,056 veterans are homeless on any given night.\n\nOn the other coast, reports the New York Post , Democrats in the New York State Legislature \u201c\u2026 set aside $27 million in tuition assistance for the children of undocumented immigrants in the new state budget \u2014 but wouldn\u2019t add hundreds of thousands of dollars to expand a similar program for kids of deceased and disabled veterans.\u201d\n\nIn foreign policy, it appears that many Democrats haven\u2019t had time to review international realities.\n\nIgnoring Moscow\u2019s massive weapons programs, which have made Russia the planet\u2019s strongest nuclear power, and China\u2019s leap to military superpower status. (as well as the aggressive moves made by each, and their alliance with each other) is dangerous and absurd. Yet little emphasis on defense is placed by the field of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders. They uniformly seek to slash U.S. defense spending at a time of the most significant threats since the end of the Second World War.\n\nFar too many Democrats openly support anti-Semitic movements, such as the \u201cBoycott, Disinvest, and Sanction\u201d (BDS) movement.\n\nAmerican politics is rapidly reaching the edge of a dangerous precipice.\n\nFrank Vernuccio serves as editor-in-chief of the New York Analysis of Policy and Government.", "description": "The startling proposals and legislation pushed by Democrat presidential candidates, .09/12/2019 3:12:08AM EST.", "authors": ["Frank Vernuccio", "Beth Baumann", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/309/e41ccc48-8633-44c6-9ae5-8095d0c9ad0e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
