The X2 Pro has Qualcomm\u2019s fastest processor available, a screen with a high refresh rate, and a quad-camera array including a giant 64-megapixel sensor. All of this means it\u2019s Realme\u2019s priciest phone to date, but the spec sheet keeps it extremely competitive.\n\nThe X2 Pro\u2019s industrial design is pretty boring, but there\u2019s nothing really wrong with it either. There\u2019s an unobtrusive waterdrop notch in the display, along with a bottom bezel that\u2019s only very slightly larger than the other three. Realme has moved to a glass back panel for the X2 Pro, which feels better to the touch than the previous plastic designs but obviously compromises on durability.\n\nDespite the small bezels, the X2 Pro manages to squeeze in stereo speakers that actually sound quite good; taken together with the above-average haptic feedback system, it\u2019s clear Realme has made a point of including features that more expensive Chinese phones often skimp on. Unfortunately, though, that doesn\u2019t extend to wireless charging.\n\nThe screen is a 6.5-inch 1080p OLED panel with an in-display fingerprint sensor and a refresh rate of 90Hz. Higher refresh rates are starting to become more common on flagship phones like the OnePlus 7T and (reportedly) the upcoming Pixel 4, and it really is hard to go back once you\u2019ve been using a screen like this for a while. The Realme X2 Pro feels incredibly smooth in use, especially for basic actions like scrolling through timelines or swiping between home screen pages, where text remains readable in motion.\n\nThe speedy feel of the phone is bolstered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, the fastest currently available on any Android phone. The X2 Pro comes with either 6GB, 8GB, or 12GB of RAM and 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of flash storage.\n\nThe camera setup includes that same 64-megapixel sensor from Samsung along with a 13-megapixel telephoto, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro lens. There\u2019s also a 16-megapixel selfie camera. You can see how the 64-megapixel camera performed on last month\u2019s Realme XT here:\n\nThe X2 Pro can fast-charge at up to 50W with Oppo\u2019s proprietary Super VOOC technology, which Realme says should get you 80 percent of a full charge in half an hour. The phone has a 4,000mAh battery, so that\u2019s not quite as fast as Oppo\u2019s own new Reno Ace \u2014 with which it shares both battery size and almost identical industrial design \u2014 but it\u2019s still right up there as far as fast-charging solutions go.\n\nThis sounds a lot like the OnePlus 7T\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking this sounds a lot like the OnePlus 7T, another phone produced under the umbrella of BBK Electronics\u2019 all-encompassing supply chain, you\u2019d be right. The screen, processor, speakers, fingerprint sensor, and other aspects of the phone are all similar, if not identical. But the X2 Pro has an extra camera lens (of dubious value, admittedly), a bigger main camera sensor, and faster fast-charging. OnePlus\u2019 main advantage is in its zippy OxygenOS software built atop Android 10. Realme uses Oppo\u2019s ColorOS, which has quite a bit in common, but it\u2019s more influenced by iOS and is still stuck on Android 9 in its current iteration.\n\nThat may not be as much of a concern when you consider this phone\u2019s pricing. In China, the X2 Pro costs 2,699 yuan (~$380) for a 6GB/64GB model, going up to 2,899 yuan (~$410) for 8GB/128GB and 3,299 yuan (~$465) for 12GB/256GB. It probably won\u2019t be quite that cheap when released outside of China, but it\u2019s clear that the X2 Pro will undercut the OnePlus 7T, and will likely be a serious competitor to phones like Xiaomi\u2019s Mi 9T Pro/Redmi K20 Pro.\n\nThe Realme X2 Pro is launching in China and Europe first and is set to follow in India in December.", "description": "Realme is releasing its first phone that could seriously be described as high-end.
