It reminds me of how it felt freeing when airports first started letting people check in at touchscreen kiosks... right up until the moment you realized you still had to stand in a twisting line if you needed to check a bag.\n\nBuying cars online is not a new idea \u2014 just look at sites like CarMax or Carvana \u2014 but they are a newer idea for automakers and their dealerships, so it makes sense that Porsche would want to carefully wade in. One exception to this rule is Tesla, which has put even more focus on online sales this year that CEO Elon Musk boasts can be completed in just two minutes.\n\nTesla promotes online ordering in just a few minutes, with door-to-door delivery\n\nThe biggest difference between Tesla and Porsche\u2019s online sales at the moment is that Tesla (like CarMax or Carvana) will ship the car to you, no separate trip required. Musk\u2019s boasts about the ease of Tesla\u2019s ordering process sometimes cause me to recoil a bit; shouldn\u2019t making a $40,000 and up buying decision have a few hurdles? In that sense, I\u2019m sort of happy to see that you can\u2019t just impulsively snap up a new Porsche without having to dwell on the decision as you trek to the dealer to finish the transaction.\n\nThat trip could offer certain customers a lot of reflection time, too, as only 25 of the 191 independently owned and operated Porsche dealers in the country are part of the pilot. (Porsche is also trialing online sales in Germany.) Porsche says more dealers may allow online sales in the future, though that depends on the results and feedback of the new pilot program.", "description": "Porsche has announced that it will start selling new and pre-owned cars and SUVs online in the US, but there\u2019s a catch: buyers will still have to trek to a dealership to sign some paperwork and, of course, pick up their vehicle.", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kBE9ALm7MpPDcIuZrXMZ7Rwoowo=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19167803/porsche_taycan_turbo_1098.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
