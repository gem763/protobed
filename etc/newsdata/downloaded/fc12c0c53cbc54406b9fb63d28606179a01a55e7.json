(Michael McArthur/ CBC)\n\n\"My God, just when we thought this is a new start, now we've got this to deal with,\" said Kendall, 65. \"I was speechless, absolutely speechless and disgusted.\"\n\nShe says she had hoped the sale of their New West condo would lead to a smooth semi-retirement in their new home in Campbell River. Now, Dupuis is asking the courts for a stake in that home until the dispute is resolved.\n\nFor his part, their former notary public also isn't happy the dispute has ended up in court.\n\n\"I was disappointed and disheartened by that to say the least,\" said Dupuis.\n\nClaims and counterclaims\n\nIn a civil claim filed in B.C. Supreme court, Dupuis alleges the higher price was paid out of his trust account to the Kendalls before he realized the error, giving his clients $20,000 more than he received from the buyer.\n\nDupuis claims when he told the Kendalls about the overpayment, they \"refused or neglected to return the money.\"\n\nHe's suing the Kendalls for the $20,000 and asking the courts to give him a \"beneficial interest\" in the new home they went on to purchase in Campbell River.\n\nNew Westminster notary Chris Dupuis says he's 'disappointed and disheartened' the case has ended up in court. (cwdupuis.com)\n\nThe Kendalls have filed a counterclaim against Dupuis, alleging they never refused to pay \u2014 but didn't receive an adequate explanation of the \"alleged error\" and were concerned about \"simply paying $20,000 \u2026 without any questions asked.\"\n\nIn turn, they're suing their former notary for negligence, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duties \u2014 the legal obligation to act in their best interest.\n\nThey're also seeking damages for mental distress.\n\nBoth sides seem surprised the typo tussle has escalated so quickly into claims and counter claims.\n\nLegal trouble timeline\n\nThe trouble began not long after the sale of the Kendall's New West condo was completed May 15.\n\nOn June 28, Dupuis alleges his staff advised the Kendalls of the $20,000 overpayment \"and requested the return of the funds as soon as possible.\"\n\nBy July 3, he claims he sent a letter \"clearly and fully explaining the typographical error,\" and \"provided supporting documentation.\"\n\nBut on July 6, Dupuis alleges the Kendalls advised him they had retained a lawyer, then fell silent.\n\nOn July 29, one month after the couple were first informed of the overpayment, the notary commenced legal action.\n\nThe Kendalls countersued on Sept. 4, claiming they were unable to respond prior to Dupuis starting court action because of a death in the family.\n\n'It escalated so quickly'\n\n\"It was just stunning to me. And it escalated so quickly,\" said Colleen Kendall.\n\nTheir former notary says he felt he had no choice \u2014 because the Kendalls hired a lawyer shortly after he asked for the money back.\n\n\"I expected this could be dealt with in an amicable way,\" said Dupuis in a statement emailed to CBC News.\n\nThe Kendalls are especially irked Dupuis is now claiming an interest in their new home in Campbell River.\n\nChris Dupuis is asking the courts to give him a claim against the title of the Kendall's new Campbell River home.

Instead, the semi-retired couple claim the money was put into long term-investments that can't be redeemed without penalty.\n\nIn addition to their counterclaim, they've filed a formal complaint against Dupuis with the Society of Notaries Public of B.C., the profession's governing body.\n\nThe society says it \"will generally wait for the conclusion of any legal action\" prior to considering complaints.\n\nLegal costs mounting\n\nDespite the entrenched positions in their lawsuits, both sides seem surprised to be at legal loggerheads.\n\n\"The stress level is extremely high,\" said Kendall. \"Legal costs are mounting up with the threat of going to court and trial, which is not what we want.\"\n\nTheir former notary echoes that sentiment.\n\n\"It remains my hope that the court proceedings will not be necessary and that we can deal with this matter as reasonable people.\"\n\nThe allegations and counter-allegations haven't been proven in court.\n\nA trial date over the alleged $20,000 typo has yet to be set.", "description": "An alleged $20,000 typo has sparked a bitter legal battle over the sale of a New Westminster, B.C., condo.
