The former ski-jumper and his Jumbo-Visma teammates were involved in a mass crash on the opening team time-trial, which ultimately forced Steven Kruijswijk to abandon the race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special moment. It\u2019s nice to come to the end of La Vuelta and for sure I\u2019ll be happy in Madrid,\u201d Roglic said as the final stage began. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be in this place and it also gives me confidence for the upcoming years,\u201d he added, before thanking his teammates. \u201cWe\u2019re riding together. I couldn\u2019t have done it on my own.\u201d\n\nRoglic finished two minutes 16 seconds clear of Alejandro Valverde, with his compatriot Tadej Pogacar finishing third. The 20-year-old Pogacar also won the white jersey for the best young rider, having claimed three stage victories en route to Madrid.\n\nThe British rider James Knox (Deceuninck\u2013Quick-Step) narrowly missed out on a top-10 finish, with the 23-year-old coming 11th in the general classification.", "description": "Primoz Roglic became the first Slovenian to win a Grand Tour when he completed his Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a victory in Madrid ahead of Alejandro Valverde on Sunday", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da869a65184d5068f26cf133269dc2e82c136b45/0_91_3370_2022/master/3370.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3dd9cd2464f64aacc06e1f06141a7174", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
