Some synagogues and temples will be crowded the way churches are on Easter, but most won\u2019t have many worshippers on a typical Sabbath.\n\nDo those who don\u2019t know history repeat the errors of others? A book published 85 years ago -- Jewish Theological Seminary professor Mordecai Kaplan\u2019s \u201cJudaism as a Civilization\u201d -- led many Jews away from Judaism. Books with similar themes today are undermining Biblical Christianity.\n\nKaplan before World War II went on speaking tours, praising Judaism as a fine result of natural human development rather than divine inspiration. He said the Hebrew Bible was not God\u2019s Word, merely a key document in the evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people. Noah\u2019s flood was not a mega-drowning but a writer\u2019s device to get our attention. Exodus was a work of fiction rather than an actual history of liberation from bondage.\n\nKaplan said young people were abandoning a Judaism based on the supernatural, for they did not find Biblical accounts believable. For the sake of the children, professors should present the Bible as merely \u201cancient religious folklore ... there would be once and for all an end to that mental conflict which has alienated Jewish youth from their religion.\u201d\n\nKaplan taught that the Bible is not special: \u201cBeliefs similar to those found in the Bible about God arise among all peoples at a certain stage of mental and social development. ... The truths established by the various sciences of human nature and history no longer permit us to concede that Israel received a type of revelation or communication that was outside the order of nature.\u201d\n\nFor the sake of the children, Jews should view Darwinian evolution as not only true but joyful: \u201cThe Darwinian conception of the descent of man from the lower animals ... holds forth the promise of man\u2019s evolving into a much higher type of being than he is now. Man has so far transcended his original animal nature as to possess reason and spirit.\u201d\n\nAfter World War II, many Jews learned of the Holocaust and saw incredible tragedy, but Kaplan saw man still progressing toward \u201cthe eventual dominance of his rational and ethical sense over his sensual appetites and savage lusts.\u201d He published a complete \u2018siddur\u2019 (prayer book) that omitted references to basic Jewish doctrines. A supernatural God who hears prayers? Gone. God punishes evil? Gone.\n\nOrthodox rabbis vehemently disagreed. They called Kaplan a heretic and agreed \u201cto excommunicate him and to separate him from the community of Israel until he fully repents.\u201d Some publicly burned a copy of Kaplan\u2019s prayer book in a New York City hotel.\n\nKaplan pushed back by starting within Judaism a \u201cReconstructionist\u201d strain that amounted to a doughnut faith: Doughy but with a hole in the middle, where theology should be. Kaplan\u2019s son-in-law, Ira Eisenstein, reported that the great professor at prayer times \u201cwould put on \u2018tallis\u2019 [prayer shawl] and \u2018tefillin\u2019 [phylacteries] and read from John Dewey,\u201d the progressive sage.\n\nKaplan also published \u201cThe New Haggadah for the Pesach Seder.\u201d (A \u2018haggadah\u2019 is a prayer book used at Passover meals.) It was \u201cnew\u201d because it minimized the miracles of the Exodus story, but it apparently did not become new enough. Now a trip to Amazon.com or other sites yields titles like \u201cHaggadah for Jews & Buddhists,\u201d \u201cA Hip Hop Haggadah,\u201d \u201cThe Hyper-Modern Ancient With-It Traditional Haggadah,\u201d the \u201cLove and Justice in Times of War Haggadah\u201d(for LGBT users), and the punny \u201cHaggadah Good Feeling About This.\u201d\n\nThe forecast of the Orthodox rabbis was right. Kaplan\u2019s \u201cReconstructionism\u201d did not satisfy. The sect still has a minor presence in Judaism, but most rebels against Orthodox Judaism did not get off at the Reconstructionist bus stop. One of my cousins became a Jubu, trying to meld Moses and Buddha. Many became atheists. Some, surprised by Christ, became evangelicals (like me) or -- like Robert Novak and Hadley Arkes -- Catholics.\n\nToday, millions who grew up in Christian homes are asking: What difference does the Bible make? We might think the way to hold onto them is to say, \u201cNot much. Believe in evolution. Have an abortion.\u201d That\u2019s Biblically wrong, of course, but -- judging by the Jewish experience -- it\u2019s also impractical. Judaism\u2019s disappearing numbers teach that expecting faith, while lacking a theological core, is tap-dancing in the air.", "description": "Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year\u2019s Day, begins this year .09/22/2019 1:12:00AM EST.", "authors": ["Marvin Olasky", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/157/e789e939-7d39-4550-99ca-681613e2d1c5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
