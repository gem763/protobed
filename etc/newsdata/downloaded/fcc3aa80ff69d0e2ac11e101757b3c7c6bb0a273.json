As two of the hottest favourites in the world road race championship fell to pieces in the space of 15 minutes the 23-year-old Mads Pedersen sprang through in unexpected style to give Denmark its first elite men\u2019s title beating Italy\u2019s Matteo Trentin, becoming the youngest male world champion in the category in 20 years.\n\nCycling World Championships 2019: Mads Pedersen wins men's elite road race \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\n\u201cAfter six and a half hours on the bike like that, everyone is on the limit and anything can happen,\u201d said Pedersen.\n\nAt the bell the title looked destined for Mathieu van der Poel or Trentin, the two men who had dominated the Tour of Britain a couple of weeks ago. The young Dutchman had sprung clear of a sodden, struggling peloton on the stiff little climb of Oak Beck with two and a half laps remaining, and Trentin \u2013 as he had done several times on British roads earlier this month \u2013 had been on him like a shot.\n\nThe pair had linked up with an earlier move that included Pedersen, the Swiss track specialist Stefan K\u00fcng and the Italian Gianni Moscon. With the strength of the Belgian and French teams fading \u2013 owing partly, no doubt, to the low temperatures and constant soaking \u2013 and Peter Sagan playing a waiting game, the quintet gradually forged a lead nudging a minute.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riders endured tricky conditions on Cray Summit.

However, as others have found, the Parliament Street finish can be unexpectedly tough. Trentin launched his sprint at 200m to go just after passing Bettys Tea Rooms but faded like a deflating Yorkshire pudding.\n\nPedersen\u2019s instant reaction as Trentin kicked showed he had adapted the best to the grim conditions and he overhauled the Italian with apparent ease to win by well over a bike length, adding a first major title to a more than respectable record. Last year he was the youngest podium finisher in the Tour of Flanders when he took second to Niki Terpstra, something that now looks like a springboard to cycling\u2019s ultimate single-day title.\n\nA former winner of the junior Paris-Roubaix with a string of victories at under-23 level, he had expected to work for Jakob Fuglsang and Michael Valgren but, when neither of his leaders made it into the winning break, he took his chance. \u201cThe plan was for me to get in a move early in the final phase and Fuglsang and Valgren would come from behind, but they couldn\u2019t follow Van der Poel and Trentin. In the sprint I wanted to survive.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nThis was a sodden climax to a weather-battered nine days of racing. Rain fell throughout, for the second time in the week the fanzone was closed because of flooding, while there was little helicopter television footage because of low cloud and breaks in television transmission because of issues with the relay plane. Throughout, the riders were swaddled in rain jerseys, capes and gilets, faces grew increasingly drawn and red-eyed and towards the end riders could be seen wringing out their rain gloves and flapping their hands to keep the blood moving.\n\nYorkshire flies its flags for local cycling hero Lizzie Deignan Read more\n\nThere was a lengthy list of withdrawals: Primoz Roglic almost as soon as the race reached Harrogate with 125km remaining; the 2013 champion, Philippe Gilbert, and his young teammate Remco Evenepoel following a heavy crash on Parliament Street; the defending champion, Alejandro Valverde, as the race began building with 60km to go; and Geraint Thomas shortly afterwards.\n\nThere were vast puddles and glassy corners to negotiate but most significant was flooding in the high Pennines that caused the race route to be amended at the last minute to eliminate a loop over the climbs of Buttertubs and Grinton Moor.\n\nArguably, that made the course harder, with two extra laps of the unforgiving finish circuit in Harrogate added to the initial seven to make up the distance.\n\n\u201cA world championship for madmen,\u201d said Valverde. Maybe, but definitely one for Mads.", "description": "Mads Pedersen beat Matteo Trentin in a sprint finish in Harrogate to become the youngest male world champion of the elite road race in 20 years", "authors": ["William Fotheringham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1d39afade41a74cd00a995fa6dd67185a4631e9/0_13_2841_1705/master/2841.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea86d54e9be92e9d9a89fa4e8ae471f7"}
