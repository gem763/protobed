It was just clear that we both had found a new love affair,\u201d says Sant, 88, co-founder and former CEO of the Virginia -based global electrical power company AES Corp.\n\nVicki, who died last December, \u201chad been enthralled by these painters\u201d since she had taken an art history course when she was a student at Stanford University, Sant says, but at that time, \u201cI hardly knew anything about them.\u201d\n\nThe decision to collect works by the Nabis\u2014whose artists include Pierre Bonnard, \u00c9douard Vuillard, Maurice Denis, and F\u00e9lix Vallotton \u2014began on impulse at that Grand Palais show, which the couple attended during a trip led by Charlie Moffett, then the director of the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C.\n\nFelix Vallotton, Passerby, 1897. Courtesy of the Phillips Collection\n\n\u201cWe made a deal with Charlie Moffett that said, if you\u2019ll act as our advisor, we\u2019ll promise to give the collection to the Phillips,\u201d Sant recalls.\n\nThat commitment was fulfilled, as Moffett advised the Sants until his death four years ago, continuing even after he left the Phillips for Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nOn Oct. 26, the Sants\u2019 Nabi collection of more than 40 paintings and works on paper, as well as two print portfolios, went on display at the Phillips, where they will eventually be gifted. The Sants, who helped fund the museum\u2019s Sant Building expansion in 2006, also provided a major bequest to create an endowment to support the Sant Nabi Collection into the future.\n\nSant took his first spin through Bonnard To Vuillard: The Intimate Poetry of Everyday Life, before an opening reception last week. While he\u2019s sad not to live among the works in his Georgetown, Washington, D.C., home for the moment, he says he was thrilled by the way the works were displayed at the museum.\n\n\u201cI just thought, oh my gosh, this is so much fun to see it in that completely different context, in a different setting,\u201d Sant says. \u201cIt\u2019s like seeing them all over again.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the Grand Palais tour, Sant was still CEO of AES, which he co-founded after serving as the Federal Energy Administration\u2019s assistant administrator for energy conservation and the environment.\n\n\u201cWe were right in the middle of huge growth,\u201d Sant says. \u201cThis seemed like a refuge from all of that hustle and bustle and a way for me to kind of get my arms around something that was so [inspiring], culturally, but what was also just such a pleasure to look at.\u201d\n\nVicki Sant, meanwhile, had connected with the Phillips during their early years in D.C., first as a fundraising volunteer, and then later, joining the board of trustees in 1991 and serving as chair from 2002-03. She also was on the board of the National Gallery of Art from 2000 to 2015, serving as chair for 12 of those years.\n\nSant says his wife\u2019s two great passions were equality for women and girls\u2014which they supported through their family foundation\u2014and art. \u201cFortunately art was always kind of a refuge from the more difficult questions of girls equality and the difficult problems of making real progress there,\u201d Sant says. \u201cBut she always used it as sort of a way to get refuge and, so did I.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Roger Sant to the Nabi artists at the Grand Palais was the way the artists rendered interiors. \u201cAfter seeing a lot of impressionist exterior landscapes, the interiors seemed so beautiful, and the way they use colors\u2014vivid colors, offset by patterns,\u201d Sant says.\n\nKnowing that he could never study the breadth of art history, Sant says he found it satisfying to focus on this group of artists, who largely produced works during the last decade of the 1800s. That way he could become \u201cknowledgeable enough to feel like I knew what I was looking at\u2014I knew what was good and what wasn\u2019t good,\u201d Sant says, \u201cbut I also knew something about the origin of the group, which is fascinating. I found those artists so culturally broad in their interests.\u201d\n\nBoth Sants have said their favorite was Vuillard\u2019s Interior with Red Bed or The Bridal Chamber, 1893, which captures housemaids wearing clothes of varying patterns tidying up a room accented by a bold red bedspread. \u201cThe woman who\u2019s looking out at us, in the foreground, looks so happy,\u201d Vicki Sant said in an interview with Dorothy Kosinski, Vradenburg Director and CEO of the Phillips that\u2019s printed in a catalog of the exhibition.\n\nAnother favorite of Sant\u2019s is also by Vuillard. Sleeping Woman, 1892, was the first Nabi painting the couple bought, purchasing it from Jacques Salomon, Vuillard\u2019s nephew by marriage. Although a \u201cquiet painting,\u201d and not as vibrantly painted as other Nabi works, the couple was instantly drawn to it, Sant says. It always hung in their bedroom.\n\nStill, Sant says his favorites among the Nabis can vary. \u201cThere are times when I\u2019m completely taken by several of the other paintings,\u201d Sant says.\n\nIn a statement, Kosinski described the gift of the Nabi collection as \u201cnothing short of transformative,\u201d allowing the museum to grow its holdings and to strengthen its role \u201cas a leading center for the research and presentation of late-19th-century European art.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition will be on display at the Phillips Collection through Jan. 26.", "description": "The Washington, D.C., philanthropists and collectors have gifted these late-19th century works to the museum", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-121383/social", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
