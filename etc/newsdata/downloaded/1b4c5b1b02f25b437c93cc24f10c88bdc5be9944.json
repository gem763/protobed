I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Romo said in a televised press conference after video of the incidents sparked criticism on social media. \u201cThis is not going to happen again.\u201d\n\nThe protests first erupted in the Andean nation of 17 million people a week ago when Moreno cut fuel subsidies here as part of a package of measures in line with a $4.2 billion IMF loan.\n\n\u201cWhat the government has done is reward the big banks, the capitalists, and punish poor Ecuadoreans,\u201d said Mesias Tatamuez, head of the Workers\u2019 United Front umbrella union.\n\nThe main indigenous group CONAIE, which has mobilized several thousands members to Quito from outlying areas, demanded Romo step down and said the government was behaving like a \u201cmilitary dictatorship\u201d by declaring a state of emergency and setting an overnight curfew.\n\nProtesters barricaded roads in various parts of Ecuador from Wednesday morning with debris, while security forces blocked a major bridge in Guayaquil to thwart them.\n\nMoreno, 66, who succeeded leftist leader Rafael Correa in 2017, has relocated his government base to Guayaquil where there has been less trouble than in Quito.\n\nThe demonstrators\u2019 main demand is the withdrawal of the fuel subsidy cut, which has sent transport and food prices soaring, though some were also urging Moreno to quit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why I should if I\u2019m making the right decisions,\u201d Moreno said late on Tuesday, arguing Ecuador\u2019s large debt and fiscal deficit necessitated belt-tightening reforms.\n\nFor seven days, protesters have been marching and barricading roads with burning tires, while police in armored vehicles have responded with water cannon and gas.\n\n\u201cMoreno out!\u201d and \u201cPolice murderers!\u201d, demonstrators shouted on Wednesday.\n\nJAILBREAK\n\nThe unrest was the second major challenge to a South American leader this year over opposition to the IMF. Argentine President Mauricio Macri was trounced in an August primary vote amid stiff opposition to an IMF deal he signed last year.\n\nAuthorities in Ecuador have arrested more than 700 people in a week of unrest. Some 86 police and 360 civilians have been wounded in the unrest so far, Romo said.\n\nOne man died after he was hit by a car and an ambulance could not reach him amid the chaos, while another two people fell off a bridge during protests, with some unconfirmed reports that they died.\n\nDemonstrators march during a protest against Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno's austerity measures, in Quito, Ecuador October 9, 2019.

The March 2022 bond EC145851467= was down nearly 6 cents to its lowest since February, its yield briefly topping 9% for the first time in eight months.\n\nMoreno said he hoped dialogue could help end the dispute, promising measures to offset prices rises, including extra welfare benefits for the poor and credits for farmers.\n\nThe United Nations said it had held preliminary meetings with some social organizations at the request of the government, but stressed that they were not negotiations.\n\n\u201cIf all actors are willing, the United Nations System is willing to collaborate as a facilitator,\u201d it said on Wednesday.\n\nSome relief for Moreno\u2019s government came for the government in Guayaquil, where thousands dressed in white held a \u201cpeace march\u201d, outnumbering protesters scuffling with police and soldiers elsewhere.\n\nMoreno has accused former friend, mentor and boss Correa of seeking a coup with the help of fellow socialist President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. But no evidence has been given.\n\nMoreno had enthusiastically backed Correa during his decade-long rule, serving as his vice-president, but broke with him after winning election and moved economic policies to the right.\n\nSlideshow (32 Images)\n\nFrom Belgium where he lives, Correa has been applauding the demonstrators but scoffed at accusations of seeking a coup. Maduro, himself immersed in economic crisis in Venezuela, also denied involvement in Ecuador.\n\nMoreno has support from the business elite and the military appears to remain loyal, but his popularity is less than half of what it was two years ago and he knows that indigenous protests helped topple three presidents before Correa.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him to quit,\u201d said printer and father-of-eight Luis Calvopina, 53. \u201cBut I do want him to reverse this stupidity.\u201d", "description": "Ecuadorean security forces cracked down on protesters in a massive national strike on Wednesday as President Lenin Moreno stuck by austerity measures that have triggered the worst unrest in a decade.", "authors": ["Alexandra Valencia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439043942&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981WW", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
