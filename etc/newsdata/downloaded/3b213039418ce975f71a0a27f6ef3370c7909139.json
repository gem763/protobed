Right?\n\nIt would have been so for the forest officials in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Lakhimpur Kheri too but the recent post-mortem report of a tigress which was found dead in a canal in the region has now made them uneasy.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE. BCCL\n\nThe post mortem report, which has shocked many in the forest department, has pointed to the presence of pesticides in the stomach of the dead tigress.\n\nAccording to news agency IANS, the corpse of the tigress in question was found in a canal in Lakhimpur Kheri in July this year. But the reason of death could not be ascertained at the moment even as the forest officials looked around for all possible causes. There were no injury marks on the animal's body and it looked more or less healthy.\n\nDon't Miss 543 SHARES 1.9 K SHARES 578 SHARES 225 SHARES 117 SHARES\n\nThe corpse of tigress was then sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute, which is located in Bareilly. The doctors preserved her viscera for further tests.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE.

He, however, refused to say anything further.\n\nEarlier, IVRI Director RK Singh had confirmed submission of the report to the forest officer.\n\nWhile some suspected that the tigress might had licked the grass containing pesticide, Sameer Kumar rubbished the theory saying pork was found in her stomach.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE. BCCL\n\nTherefore the prevailing theory right now among Lakhimpur Kheri farmers as well as officials is that they sprinkled pesticides in sugarcane fields, which got transferred to the tigress through the pig that the tigress ate.\n\nWorth reflecting at this juncture is the fact that the same sugarcane is consumed directly or indirectly by humans and several other animals including cows, whose milk and meat is consumed by humans, too graze in these fields.\n\nTherefore, when traces of pesticides are found in the dead tigress stomach, how long will it to enter the human system? Or has it already?", "description": "All of us learnt about the concept of food chain in our early days of schooling but somewhere down the line as life gets better of us we tend to forget these core issues around which our life revolves.
