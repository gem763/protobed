At one point, the Steelers trailed only 21-19 with 11:16 left in the game after Rudolph hit Vance McDonald with an 8-yard TD pass.\n\nWhen the Steelers drafted Rudolph, Roethlisberger wasn\u2019t impressed because he wanted a player who could help Pittsburgh right away. Rudolph didn\u2019t play as a rookie, but he was in a key spot on Sunday afternoon due to Roethlisberger\u2019s injury.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
