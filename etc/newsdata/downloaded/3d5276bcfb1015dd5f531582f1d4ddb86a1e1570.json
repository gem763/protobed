The Bitcoin (BTC) price has dumped by over $450 in the past few minutes, with bears finally managing to take the wheel of the cryptocurrency market after over two weeks of lull.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear what triggered this move, but with this flash crash, the leading cryptocurrency has decidedly shed the $10,000 support.\n\nWith this $500 drop, bullish traders on BitMEX and other leverage-enabled platforms were hit fairly hard.\n\nAccording to Skew Markets, a cryptocurrency analytics firm, in fact, over $150 million worth of BTC long positions on BitMEX were liquidated in the past hour.\n\nLiquidated long on XBTUSD: Sell 10,000,000 @ 9760 \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf ~ hide your kids, hide your wife, cause they\u2019re liquidatin\u2019 everybody out here \u2014 REKT (@BXRekt) September 19, 2019\n\nThis move brings Bitcoin to a very important territory, analyst Magic has said. As he pointed out in the tweet below, BTC is now testing the 21-week moving average right now, which, as reported by this outlet previously, is a level Bitcoin flirted with during 2017\u2019s bull market on over four separate occasions. The loss of this level could imply that bulls are losing control of the long-term trend.\n\nBitcoin is testing the 21 week MA right now. This is the moment of truth! \u2014 MAGIC (@MagicPoopCannon) September 19, 2019\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Ouch.
