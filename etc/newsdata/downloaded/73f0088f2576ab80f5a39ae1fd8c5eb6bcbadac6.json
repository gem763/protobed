Their fingertips, nearly stripped of all flesh from excessive tweeting, have lost agility. Heads droop over coffee-stained laptops; they can\u2019t even muster enough energy to brush off the morning\u2019s donut crumbs from the keyboard.\n\nCognitive fatigue has set in: \u201cHow do you spell Haberman again,\u201d they mumble to themselves as they struggle to search the pages of the New York Times. Slippered feet shuffle aimlessly under the desk of their home office. Makeup artists in the MSNBC green room desperately try to conceal dark circles sagging under the eyes of barely-functioning hosts and guests.\n\nNow, one can understand the fatigue associated with a prolonged hangover after a two-year bender on Trump-Russian collusion that came up empty. One can certainly sympathize with talking heads and columnists who want to crawl under the covers after being wrong about nearly everything since 2016. And, really, having to interview Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) for the umpteenth time would take its toll on any mere mortal.\n\nBut, of course, their collective exhaustion is caused most of all by Donald Trump. In embarrassing fashion, anti-Trump pundits on the Left and Right are admitting that the president is getting the best of them. NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, mercifully giving the \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d canard a temporary rest, launched this week\u2019s new narrative. \u201cWeeks like this is [sic] what wear people out,\u201d Todd told Andrea Mitchell on August 23. \u201cAmen,\u201d she replied. Todd further claimed, without evidence, that even Trump\u2019s supporters are \u201cexhausted.\u201d\n\nA cadre of prostrate pundits chimed in. \u201cThe editors of National Review are exhausted with presidential tweets, from asking whether Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell or Chinese leader Chairman Xi is the bigger enemy, to \u2018hereby ordering\u2019 private companies to look for alternatives to operations in China,\u201d confessed National Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty on August 26.\u201d (Imagine being a grown adult and publicly admitting that a few crazy social media posts are grinding you down.)\n\nGeraghty then mimicked Todd\u2019s assertion that \u201ceven Trump\u2019s supporters are getting tired of his daily drama,\u201d but his proof only included a shortlist of random comments by a handful of professional opinionators.\n\nKyle Smith, NR\u2019s critic-at-large, concurred. \u201cIt really is hard to imagine 5 and a half more years of this. It\u2019s just exhausting,\u201d he tweeted. The affliction spread on the commentariat\u2019s right-wing, with Washington Examiner editor Seth Mandel Twitter-whining, \u201cAren\u2019t you tired? I\u2019m tired.\u201d\n\nMSNBC contributor Neera Tanden told Chris Matthews on August 28 that she, too, was exhausted. When Tanden, head of a progressive think tank, asked the Twitterverse who else was exhausted, her tweet was liked more than 12,000 times.\n\nNo one, however, is more tired than New York Times columnist Frank Bruni. In what could be the most humiliating confession of the week/year/decade, Bruni told his readers how he spent a summer Saturday morning\u2014incapacitated by news headlines about Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cHe had commandeered too many of my thoughts, run roughshod over too many of my emotions, made me question too many articles of faith,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was sapped\u2014if not quite of the will to live, then of the will to tweet, to Google and to surf the cable channels, where his furious mien and curious mane are ubiquitous. What I was feeling was beyond Trump fatigue and bigger than Trump exhaustion. It was Trump enervation. Trump enfeeblement.\u201d\n\nSomeone get this man a double espresso, stat.\n\nBruni managed to keep his eyes open long enough to find fellow bedragglers on the other side of the political aisle. \u201cApparently weariness with Trump\u2019s wackiness does something virtually unheard-of in the United States circa 2019: It transcends partisanship,\u201d he noted as he linked to Geraghty\u2019s NR column.\n\nSomehow, Bruni bravely mustered the energy to make it to the CNN studios later that day.\n\n\u201cI think voters are exhausted with melodrama,\u201d he told his fellow panelists who were, miraculously, awake. \u201cYou just have to go to his Twitter account and look at the volume and vitriol of what he tweets.\u201d (While 100 percent of political journalists are on Twitter, it\u2019s worth remembering that only about 7 percent of Americans bother with the platform.)\n\nYet through all the mental fog and haze, a campaign slogan was born. Linking to Bruni\u2019s piece, ace political consultant David Axelrod suggested this message for the Democratic presidential candidate: \u201cThe question for 2020 is not going to be \u2018Are you better off than you were four years ago?\u2019 It will be, \u2018Can we really do another four years of THIS?\u2019\u201d\n\nYes, we can?\n\nThey Brought It on Themselves\n\nTo be fair, Trump\u2019s tweets remain widely unpopular with voters, including many Republicans. But if there is exhaustion among Trump\u2019s supporters, it is in response to the Left\u2019s neverending assault on the president, his administration, and his voters\u2014not because of anything the president himself has done.\n\nIt is Democrats, not Trump, who launched a destructive special counsel investigation based on manufactured evidence that divided the country for more than two years. It is Democrats, not Trump, who ridicule Republicans and Trump-supporting Americans as racist rubes who want children locked in cages and concentration camps built on the southern border.\n\nIt is Democrats, not Trump, who orchestrated the vilest attack on a Supreme Court nominee in American history. It is Democrats, not Trump, who now wish for an economic recession. It is Democrats, not Trump, who side with foreign adversaries against the best interests of the country. It is Democrats, not Trump, fomenting violence against political foes.\n\nAnd all of it is amplified by a national press corps and punditry class now complaining about how tired they are. Clearly, working as de facto foot soldiers in #TheResistance after indulging in an eight-year nap has shown how badly out of shape these brave warriors have become.\n\nThere is one person, however, who doesn\u2019t seem a bit exhausted: Donald Trump. So if the Democrats and NeverTrump Republicans want a fighting shot to take him out in 2020, they had better rest up. They\u2019ll need all the energy they can get.\n\nContent created by the Center for American Greatness, Inc. is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a significant audience.
