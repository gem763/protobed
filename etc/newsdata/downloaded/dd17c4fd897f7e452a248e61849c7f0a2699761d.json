Exciting, fresh, defend well, play football and are especially threatening in counter attacks. Congratulations to them.\u201d\n\nLeicester were the last team outside the established \u2018top six\u2019 to qualify for the Champions League when they defied the odds to lift the Premier League title in the 2015-16 season.\n\nWhen asked if they could return to Europe\u2019s elite competition, Klopp said: \u201cIt looks like that, 100 percent. There is no difference to other top-six teams apart from maybe the name.\u201d\n\nKlopp took over from Rodgers at Anfield in 2015 and lives in the former Celtic boss\u2019s house.\n\nRodgers, who guided Celtic to back-to-back domestic trebles during his time in Scotland, will return to Anfield for the first time since his departure.\n\n\u201cI hope the reception from the fans will be OK,\u201d Klopp added. \u201cFrom my side it\u2019s fine. We pay enough rent to him, I\u2019m not sure he has to work!\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing really well. I\u2019m not surprised about that. He did an incredible job at Celtic, now at Leicester.\u201d\n\nLiverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker has returned to training after recovering from a calf injury but remains a doubt for the weekend\u2019s clash, while Joel Matip and Xherdan Shaqiri remain unavailable.", "description": "Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp has praised the club's former boss Brendan Rodgers for building an exciting Leicester City squad, capable of finishing in the Premier League's top-four this season.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437071379&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9316H", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
