You manage England, Man United and they are the two.\n\n\"Now, I wouldn't see a queue round the block. They are a million miles off.\n\n\"This is a \u00a3700m job. If someone like Allegri came in, he would want \u00a3700m to spend. They need seven players.\"\n\nFirst priority would be a striker, with United's failure to replace Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez having come back to haunt them in recent weeks. The club would also likely need a top holding midfielder, among other positions.", "description": "There are doubts over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's future as United boss, but pundit questions who would want to replace him", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20532598.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Everton-FC-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
