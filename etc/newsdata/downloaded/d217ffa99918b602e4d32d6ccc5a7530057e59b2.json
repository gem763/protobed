From this photo, we can\u2019t tell which one this is, but nonetheless, here\u2019s the pic.\n\nA DASH OF REALITY \u2026 FT: \u201cChina makes few concessions in trade truce with US,\u201d by Tom Mitchell in Beijing: \u201cIn return for a series of modest concessions, most of which had been offered by President Xi Jinping\u2019s administration in previous negotiating rounds, Donald Trump agreed to suspend another set of tariff increases originally scheduled to take effect on October 15.\n\n\u201cThe truce sets the stage for a series of much higher-stakes negotiations after Mr Xi and Mr Trump\u2019s expected encounter on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Conference, scheduled for November 16-17 in Santiago, Chile, where Friday\u2019s agreement will be finalised.\n\n\u201cThe two sides are still a long way from a final settlement that addresses much more contentious issues, such as Chinese government support for strategic industries and state-owned enterprises, which Mr Trump had hoped to reach before his 2020 re-election campaign kicks off in earnest. Chinese negotiators, however, believe that time is on their side and they can continue to stonewall Mr Trump and his lead negotiator, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, on any \u201csystemic\u201d reforms that they fear would weaken the Chinese Communist party\u2019s grip over the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\n\u201cIn private, Chinese officials say they are lucky Mr Trump waited a year before launching his trade assault in the spring of 2018, giving his negotiators only about 18 months to confront China before domestic political pressures would begin to hem them in. The US president wants relief for his farm-state supporters, who have borne the brunt of China\u2019s counter-tariffs, and a soaring stock market to help boost his re-election prospects.\u201d FT\n\n-- SCMP: \u201cBeijing warns of more uncertainty in trade war negotiations despite \u2018constructive\u2019 talks in Washington,\u201d by Wendy Wu\n\n-- DOUG PALMER, ADAM BEHSUDI and MEGAN CASSELLA: \u201cDerek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute who sometimes advises the White House, said U.S. businesses aren\u2019t gaining many concessions from Beijing.\n\n\u201c\u2018What the U.S. is getting is purchases and several elements of nonsense,\u2019 Scissors said before the announcement. \u2018Today seems to be another 'China-is-Great' day, but future talks face a higher risk.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- DES MOINES REGISTER: \u201cIowa leaders, farmers pleased but cautious about Trump's China trade agreement\u201d: \u201cIowa politicians, farmers and business leaders were cautiously optimistic about a Chinese trade agreement that President Donald Trump announced \u2018in principle\u2019 Friday.\n\n\u201cBut some said they wanted more specifics from the White House, citing other times over the past year when expected relief from trade tensions failed to materialize. \u2018All of these things are positive,\u2019 said Grant Kimberley, director of market development for the Iowa Soybean Association. \u2018But there\u2019s a whole lot of details that have to get worked out.

WHAT PELOSI SAID ON YESTERDAY\u2019S DEM CAUCUS CALL \u2026 \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, we all agree: nobody came to Congress to impeach a President. This is very sad for our county and we want to conduct ourselves, as Democrats, as Members of Congress worthy of the Constitution that we are there to protect. \u2026\n\n\u201cOne thing, I do want to say is that, POTUS \u2013 you know, that\u2019s the president \u2013 POTUS has become a potty-mouth and children are listening. This is \u2013 this is beyond disgraceful. But, for him to say the thing that he said about Joe Biden [in Minneapolis] was so far beyond the pale. Again, that has nothing to do with impeachment. That is about elections, and I will make my final point.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing on impeachment is about the facts \u2013 \u2018Just the facts, ma\u2019am\u2019 \u2013 and the Constitution. His policy, his personality, his potty-mouth, that\u2019s about the election and let\u2019s make sure that we understand the reasons he is \u2013 the inquiry is because he has not honored his oath of office. We will honor ours.\n\n\u201cAnd, the Senate is saying, \u2018Now that you are doing that, we are not doing it.\u2019 You know, just because we have the courage to honor our oath of office doesn\u2019t mean we have to fold to the cowardice of the Senate that is not going to honor theirs. \u2026 I\u2019ve said before Trump, himself, is not worthy of impeachment because it\u2019s divisive in the county. But our Constitution is worth it. Our democracy is worth it. And, our republic, if we can save it, is worth it.\u201d\n\n\u2026 AND THERE\u2019S MORE! NYT: \u201cGiuliani Is Said to Be Under Investigation for Ukraine Work,\u201d by Mike Schmidt, Ben Protess, Ken Vogel and William Rashbaum: \u201cFederal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe investigators are examining Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to undermine the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, one of the people said. She was recalled in the spring as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader campaign to pressure Ukraine into helping his political prospects.\n\n\u201cThe investigation into Mr. Giuliani is tied to the case against two of his associates who were arrested this week on campaign finance-related charges, the people familiar with the inquiry said.

Whether it be the wholesale elimination and prohibition of private insurance and imposition of socialized medicine in the form of Sen. Sanders\u2019 $32 trillion Medicare for All plan, or Speaker Pelosi\u2019s glidepath toward the same goal with her prescription drug pricing plan, these misguided proposals pose grave threats to the quality and availability of every single Americans\u2019 health care, to the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow, and to our nation\u2019s economy. Single payer health care schemes and drug price controls have been tried abroad with the same results: access restrictions for patients, decisions made by bureaucrats rather than patients and doctors, stifled innovation, and crippling taxes. This is not the policy prescription for health care in America.
