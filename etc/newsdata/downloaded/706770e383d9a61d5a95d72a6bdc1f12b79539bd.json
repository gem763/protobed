There will also be ceremonies before games that recognize first responders and personnel from the public service sector. Ballparks are featuring a silhouetted ribbon that says \u201cWe Shall Not Forget.\u201d\n\nPlayers, coaches and umpires are also wearing caps with a side patch of the ribbon. The Toronto Blue Jays are home Wednesday against the Boston Red Sox, and the Blue Jays will wear caps that recognize the United States and Canada.\n\nMLB will donate all of its royalties from the sale of the caps to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, the Pentagon Memorial Fund, and Flight 93 National Memorial.\n\nThe Washington Nationals play at the first-place Minnesota Twins on Wednesday while the Baltimore Orioles host the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers at 7:05 p.m. at Camden Yards.\n\nThe Orioles were slated to host the Toronto Blue Jays on September 11, 2001, but all MLB games were called off that day after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
