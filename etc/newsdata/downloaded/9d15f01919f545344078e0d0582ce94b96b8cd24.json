There have been far too many fatalities at Sibanye mines, notably this year alone,\u201d said Gcilitshana.\n\nGcilitshana said the Thursday incident caused by a seismic event at Sibanye-Stillwater\u2019s Masakhane mine, which claimed the lives of 7 workers had raised the number of fatalities so far this year to 31.\n\nA total of 13 mineworkers were initially trapped underground, others are still being treated in hospital.\n\n\u201cThe figure is much higher compared to the same period last year, where we had 28 deaths,\u201d said Gcilitshana adding that fatalities often occurred at gold and platinum mines.\n\nThe incident followed the killing of two mineworkers at Sibanye\u2019s Kloof mine in February after a fall-of-ground.\n\nEarly this year, 955 miners were temporarily trapped at another Sibanye-Stillwater mine in Welkom, after an electric cable outage during a storm. All the workers were safely rescued.\n\nTrade union Solidarity has also expressed \"grave concern\" about safety in South African mines in the wake of the Sibanye tragedy.\n\n\"Solidarity reminds employees of their legal right to withdraw from unsafe working conditions, and urges them to do so should it be necessary,\" the union said in a statement.\n\nSafety levels are a key concern in South Africa deep-level mines, with unions often calling on mining houses to do more to safeguard the lives of workers.\n\nIn November 2017, the Chamber of Mines of South Africa reported that there had been 76 deaths in mines, an increase from 73 cases reported in 2016.\n\nAlthough the statistics are significantly high, the chamber has maintained that underground deaths have reduced compared to pre-1994 levels.\n\nFollowing the last week\u2019s deaths at Sibanye, the organisations said in a statement it had \u201cnoted with concern the increase in the number of rock bursts related to seismic activity, while the number of rockfalls, which is typically the main cause of falls-of-ground, decreased.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time in many years, the industry saw a deterioration in its efforts at continuous improvement in its safety performance, as measured by the number of accident fatalities,\u201d wrote Chamber of Mines of South Africa CEO, Roger Baxter, in the March Quarterly Update.\n\n* SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE UPDATE: Get Fin24's top morning business news and opinions in your inbox.", "description": "The National Union of Mineworkers says it would engage the management of Sibanye-Stillwater following the recent deaths of workers at its mine which have pushed the national toll to 31 fatalities so far this year.", "authors": ["Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7105/d07336bbad45433b9fdff2cc46f131e7.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-06"}
