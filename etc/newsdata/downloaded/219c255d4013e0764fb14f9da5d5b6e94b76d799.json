CNN even ran an on-screen chyron: \u201cAs People Die, Trump Defends Presenting Doctored Map.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the president was again displaying his adamant refusal to let go of previous controversies where he feels he has been unfairly criticized. In this case, it was the criticism of his Sunday declaration that the hurricane might reach Alabama, which was contradicted by government forecasts. A minor mistake, easily corrected. But by using the Aug. 29 map with the added black squiggle, Trump opened the floodgates of criticism well after the press had moved on.\n\nHe also tried to claim vindication by tweeting a day-earlier map: \u201cAs you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!\u201d\n\nIt will not surprise you to learn that no apologies were forthcoming. In fact, the Washington Post reported that tampering with official weather maps is\u2026illegal.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nNow there\u2019s obviously a legitimate story here. Who wielded the now-infamous Sharpie? A White House official told Fox it was someone in the room when Trump was meeting with his emergency team, but wouldn\u2019t say who.\n\nStill, some pundits are using this episode to rail about Trump being a pathological liar who doesn\u2019t care about people dying from hurricanes. It is practically being played as a scandal. And there are online memes with Sharpie marks to doctor famous photos, such as putting more people in Trump\u2019s inaugural crowd or making him taller.\n\nBut if the media are fixated on this misstep, so is the president. Time and again, he brings up controversies that have faded from the news in an effort to vindicate his past position. If not for the altered map, precisely no one would be talking about Alabama today.\n\nLate yesterday, Trump again tweeted five- and six-day old NOAA forecast maps, saying: \u201cJust as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!\u201d But some of those maps showed only a 5 or 10 percent chance of the storm hitting a sliver of Alabama, and the projections had moved east by the time Trump first mentioned the state being in jeopardy on Sunday.\n\nWith the hurricane having hit the Carolinas and still barreling its way up the East Coast, the constant back-and-forth over a black squiggle feels like a giant distraction.", "description": "There is something seemingly ludicrous in the media obsessing on a squiggle drawn on a map with a black Sharpie, especially with millions in the path of a destructive hurricane.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/05/694940094001_6083841386001_6083835163001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
