The bulk of the purchase \u2014 345 megawatts \u2014 will come from solar installations owned by Dominion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn additional 75 megawatts will come from a new wind energy project planned for a mountaintop in Botetourt County by Charlottesville\u2019s Apex Clean Energy.\n\nEnvironmental advocates praised the effort but said it doesn\u2019t make up for Dominion\u2019s overall reliance on fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is like a moment of sunshine on a rainy day,\u201d Sierra Club Virginia chapter director Kate Addleson said via email. \u201cIf Dominion wants to do right by the customers and communities they serve, then they will cancel projects like the fracked gas Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Union Hill compressor station, support access to customer-owned solar, and stop opposing pollution reduction plans.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe $7.8 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline is being built across the middle of the state, with a key component slated for the historic African American community of Union Hill in rural Buckingham County. Pipeline construction is on hold after opponents won federal court decisions saying that permits had been awarded hastily and improperly.\n\nAD\n\nVirginia has been relatively slow to move into renewable energy. It is one of only nine states that have no installed wind turbines, according to the American Wind Energy Association.\n\nEarlier this year, a roster of major technology companies including Microsoft, Amazon and Apple expressed frustration to Virginia\u2019s utility regulator, the State Corporation Commission, faulting Dominion for failing to transition to renewables. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAD\n\nTo help jump-start the effort while maintaining its grip as the state\u2019s biggest electricity monopoly, Dominion worked with the General Assembly last year to overhaul the state\u2019s regulatory laws. The changes limited the commission\u2019s oversight role and gave Dominion leeway to invest excess profits in developing renewable energy instead of returning the money to ratepayers.\n\nAD\n\nSince then, Dominion has begun expanding its push into renewables. Last month, the company announced plans for the nation\u2019s largest offshore wind farm, now under development 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement requires the state to purchase all the energy produced by several Dominion solar facilities, minus any amount the utility sells to other customers. Essentially, it guarantees the company a customer for its product while the regulatory overhaul ensures a stream of revenue for creating such facilities in the first place.\n\nAD\n\nEnvironmental advocates have supported that arrangement as a way to make the transition away from fossil fuels financially attractive.\n\nNortham\u2019s office said the rates agreed to in the 20-year contract are a bargain for taxpayers. The agreement sets out base rates of $34 per megawatt-hour for the solar and $35 per megawatt-hour for the first five years of the wind energy. The wind base rate jumps to $53 in the sixth year and then rises over time.\n\nAD\n\nExtra \u201crider\u201d rates can be added to cover facility costs.\n\nThose base rates are in line with industry averages.\n\n\u201cBased on market projections and safety built into the contract, we expect the state will save millions over the contract term,\u201d Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky said via email. \u201cWe view this as a win win \u2014 not only are we investing in renewable energy and moving towards a cleaner energy economy, we are saving the state money at the same time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe governor\u2019s office asked the National Governors Association to compare the contract with practices around the country, and the organization said it \u201cappears to be the largest single\u201d agreement to purchase renewable energy undertaken by any state.\n\nAD", "description": "A 20-year solar and wind agreement with Dominion is called the largest of its kind in the country.", "authors": ["Gregory S.
