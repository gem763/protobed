With the controversial HS2 route ploughing through the countryside seat, and the Brexit Party revelling in delay, it will be a tasty battle.\n\nMarch of the G&T brigade\n\nCampaigners for a second referendum did little to dispel the myth that they are a bunch of middle-class elitists at their march in London last weekend.\n\nThe Marks and Spencer next to Green Park Tube station \u2013 which marked the halfway point of the route \u2013 sold out of posh cans of gin and tonic within minutes, as the empty shelves proved, while the tinnies of beer remained largely untouched.\n\nWell, the doomsday anti-Brexit campaigners did warn of empty shelves in supermarkets...\n\nEmpty shelves where gin and tonic was kept until Remainers approached\n\nIt is all getting a bit much for Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay? In the hallowed Commons tea room last week, burly Steve spilled a pot of boiling water for his brew all over the counter. The staff cleaned it up and brought him another \u2013 only for him to spill it all over again, amid profuse apologies. When he finally managed to walk away with an unspoiled third pot, he left his bank card at the till.\n\nSlick PR man Roland Rudd has taken his ousting from the People\u2019s Vote campaign in good humour. After The Mail on Sunday revealed the bitter internal civil war blighting the second referendum camp, the Guido Fawkes website ran an unflattering cartoon of Rudd having very girly fisticuffs with nemesis Alastair Campbell. I hear clubbable Rudd was quick on the blower to buy the original cartoon for \u00a3500 on Monday morning. He can hang it in one of the eight bathrooms in his Somerset pile...\n\nA push by backbench Tories to make it illegal to undermine the Government negotiating with foreign powers is growing in support amid more Brexit delay.\n\nAfter Remainers were accused of plotting with Brussels and Paris to stymie the referendum result, I hear the planned private member\u2019s bill has a catchy nickname from its backers \u2013 BLAIR\u2019S Law \u2013 short for British Legislation Against International Remainer Sabotage.\n\nPalmerston, the Foreign Office cat, has not been seen in public for weeks.\n\nHis absence has sparked dark rumours among the photographers that loiter on Whitehall, who delighted in snapping him tussling with No10 neighbour Larry.\n\nBut I hear talk of the black-and-white moggy\u2019s demise is currently wide of the mark. \u2018He\u2019s not dead, but he is very poorly,\u2019 says a Foreign Office source, diplomatically.\n\nI\u2019m told Palmerston has gone to see out his days at the home of a senior official after a long and distinguished mouse- slaying career.\n\nSome vintage Sir Humphrey behaviour from circumspect officials at Highways England.\n\nThe quango\u2019s pen-pushers were aghast when tiggerish Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Whitehall\u2019s \u2018XO\u2019 No Deal planning committee that he wanted to hang scores of giant \u2018get ready for Brexit\u2019 banners along motorways across the country.\n\n\u2018They tried every single trick in the book to kill it,\u2019 says a weary aide, \u2018including demanding special training for people to attach the signs.\u2019", "description": "Unless he rats again, by this time next week John Bercow's ignominious tenure as Commons Speaker will be over, writes HARRY COLE.", "authors": ["Harry Cole For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20229712-0-image-a-5_1572135362937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
