He leads Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., by four points, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., by 12, according to a September Real Clear Politics poll.\n\nAXELROD CLAIMS BIDEN 'SERIALLY DISTORTING' RECORD, 'IN DANGER OF CREATING MORE DAMAGING' TREND WITH GAFFES\n\nBiden has topped polls since he announced his bid in April, with numbers suggesting he will be the Democrat to beat in 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a three-person race instead of a five-person race, Warren, Sanders, and of course Biden is the frontrunner,\u201d Wallace told Hemmer.\n\nBut, will this hold through 2020?\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s closer in Iowa and much closer in New Hampshire,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut, you know, he\u2019s the frontrunner until he isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cYou can talk -- and we do talk -- in great length about all of the problems President Trump might potentially have,\u201d Wallace noted. \u201cBut, in the end, to quote Joe Biden: \u2018It\u2019s not a choice between him and the Almighty; it\u2019s a choice between him and the alternative.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe next Democratic debate will air on ABC on Thursday at Texas Southern University in Houston. Biden and Warren face off for the first time, having previously appeared on different nights at the June and July debates, which were split over two nights to accommodate the large pool of challengers.", "description": "The Democratic race is really down to three 2020 presidential candidates, \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace said\u00a0Friday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S", "America'S Newsroom."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/06/694940094001_6084165456001_6084168608001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
