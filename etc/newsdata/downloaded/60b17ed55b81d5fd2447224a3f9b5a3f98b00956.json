I don\u2019t enjoy baking. Maybe it\u2019s because I have grown to dislike anything that even vaguely reminds me of my former life as a chemist, or maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m lazy, but baking is not fun for me, and I avoid it whenever I can (and make A.A. Newton do it instead). I do, however, like eating sweets, and an icebox cake lets me combine my love of eating delicious desserts with my love of not doing very much.\n\nIf you also hate to measure, but love sugar, or are perhaps a literal child, the pumpkin icebox cake is the dessert for you. It\u2019s seasonal, it\u2019s riffable, and it\u2019s easy \u2014 some might even say \u201cfun\u201d\u2014to assemble. Is it \u201cjust a pile of cookies and whipped cream?\u201d Yes. Yes, it is. But you can\u2019t honestly tell me that sounds bad.\n\nAnother thing I like about this cake is that you can decide exactly how pumpkin-y you want it to be. Just fold in tablespoons of pumpkin puree until you reach your desired level of seasonal squash flavour, and do the same with those complementary spices. You can also change the cookies if you want. I used ginger thins, but graham crackers would work, too. For what it\u2019s worth, graham crackers make the most stable base, but even the ginger thins \u2014 which shatter if you whisper at them \u2014 will hold together if you give them enough time in the fridge. If you want to be really lazy, or want to make this more child-friendly, swap whipped cream for whipped topping. (It doesn\u2019t need to be sweetened, and will keep its structure even if your kids get carried away when \u201cgently\u201d folding in the pumpkin.)\n\nPumpkin Icebox Cake\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 pints of heavy whipping cream\n\n1/4 cup powdered sugar\n\n1/4-1/2 cup pumpkin puree\n\n2 teaspoons pumpkin spice blend\n\nCookies, the amount of which will vary depending on the size and shape of your cake pan (I used two sleeves of ginger thins, which is about 60 Oreo-sized cookies.)\n\nInstructions:\n\nCombine the cream and powdered sugar in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer or immersion blender until soft peaks form. (I prefer the immersion blender in the this case, as it makes a denser whipped cream that keeps its structure a little better than the fluffier stuff.) Gently fold in some pumpkin puree, taste, and add more if you want to. Fold in the pumpkin spice.\n\nLay down your cookies in whatever shape you wish them to take. You can put them in a casserole dish, a pie pan, or just build them freeform on a plate. Scrape the whipped cream into a piping bag (or freezer bag with the tip snipped off) and pipe it out in an even layer, using an offset spatula to smooth it out. Lay down more cookies, repeat. If you like really thick layers of cream, you may only get a couple of layers; thinner layers will \u2014 obviously \u2014 require more cookies. Continue alternating cream and cookies until your cake has reached the height you wish it to, then pop the whole thing in the fridge for at least four hours, or overnight, until the cookies have softened and the cake is sliceable. Just before serving, sprinkle on some more pumpkin spice, or let the kids decorate it with candy and sprinkles.", "description": "May I confess something? I don\u2019t enjoy baking.
