Hogan told PBS:\n\nI think we do need an inquiry because we have to get to the bottom of it. I\u2019m not ready to say I support impeachment and the removal of the president, but I do think we should have an impeachment inquiry.\n\nGov. Hogan did, however, express concern over whether Democrats could lead a \u201cfair, objective\u201d inquiry into the president\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any other way to get the facts,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nThe Maryland GOP governor previously considered whether to primary Trump, but decided against it, citing his commitment to the people of Maryland.\n\nHogan joins Massachusetts GOP Governor Charlie Baker and Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott, who both came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry in September.\n\nBaker said, \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance, and I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nGov. Scott told the Washington Post that an impeachment inquiry was \u201cappropriate\u201d and contended that it served as a critical part of Congress\u2019s duty as a co-equal branch of government:\n\nI think we have much more to learn and need to understand all the facts as this serious allegation is considered. Congress has a solemn responsibility to every American to fulfill its role in our government system of checks and balances.\n\nHowever, despite the three northeast Republican governors\u2019 support for an impeachment inquiry, New Hampshire GOP Gov. Sununu has rebuked Democrats\u2019 call for it.\n\nGov. Sununu told reporters last week that he believes that the impeachment inquiry is nothing more than partisan politics:\n\nEveryone trying to get at each other. There is no place for that here in New Hampshire. We do things differently; we get stuff done. We work across the aisle. Those types of Washington circus theatrics [should be left] for Washington.\n\nAsked whether he supports the impeachment inquiry, Sununu said, \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d\n\nWhile President Trump lost Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maryland in the 2016 presidential election by a substantial margin. Trump only lost New Hampshire by less than 3,000 votes.\n\nSununu\u2019s backing of Trump amidst an impeachment inquiry and the governor\u2019s gubernatorial victory in 2018 could signal that the president could win the state in 2020.\n\nSununu said Thursday:", "description": "New Hampshire Gov.
