That\u2019s just the way it works.\u201d\n\nThe very next month, Larry Ellison, a friend of Hurd, named him the co-president of Oracle, the company Ellison had himself founded in the summer of 1977. Said then-CEO Ellison in a statement relating to the move, \u201cMark did a brilliant job at H-P, and I expect he\u2019ll do even better at Oracle. There is no executive in the I.T. world with more relevant experience than Mark.\u201d\n\nIndeed, when Ellison stepped down as the CEO of Oracle in 2014 to become the company\u2019s chief technology officer, he promoted Hurd to the role of CEO, a role he had since shared with Oracle\u2019s former CFO, Safra Catz.\n\nWhen Hurd left last month, Catz, who has been an executive with Oracle since 1999, became the sole CEO of Oracle, though Ellison has indicated that she won\u2019t be operating the company single-handedly for long. Instead, he told analysts last month that though some people find it \u201cweird,\u201d Oracle plans to keep its dual-CEO structure, in part owing to situations as with Hurd where life throws an executive team a curveball.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, Ellison has already promised the board of directors the names of numerous internal candidates, including Don Johnson, the executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\nSaid Ellison at Oracle\u2019s OpenWorld event in San Francisco last month: \u201cI believe in a dual-CEO structure. The normal case would be dual CEO here for obvious reasons. That it\u2019s good to have capacity and good to have specialization. And then, God forbid, if something untoward should happen, you have capacity; you are not incapacitated.\u201d\n\nHurd attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas on a tennis scholarship and reportedly dabbled on the professional tennis circuit immediately after graduating. He began his career at NCR Corp., where he was promoted to chief operating officer 22 years into his tenure with the company, and to the role of CEO the following year, in 2003.\n\nTwo years later, H-P brought him aboard.\n\nHurd is survived by his wife, Paula, and daughters Kathryn and Kelly.\n\nEllison released a statement just now about the development.
