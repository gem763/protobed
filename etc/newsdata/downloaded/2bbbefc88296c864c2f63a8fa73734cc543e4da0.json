But it\u2019s none of the above. It\u2019s actually Big Pharma.\n\nAnd that explains a lot \u2014 namely, why America has become a nation of pill poppers. We have a prescription for everything nowadays. Don\u2019t agree? Flip on the TV. Count how many different ads cross the screen in any given hour promising fixes for this, cures for that. Then count how many others cross promising fixes and cures for the side effects the first batch brings.\n\nIn 2015, Big Pharma spent $5.4 billion on ads that targeted consumers, Kantar Media reported. In return, Americans spent $457 billion on prescription drugs, Drug Watch reported.\n\nNo wonder Big Pharma stomps so heavily into the political world.\n\n\u201cThe pharmaceutical industry is holding on to its title as the top lobbying force in Washington,\u201d OpenSecrets.org reported. \u201cDrugmakers have spent more than $129 million through September, slightly down from nearly $133 million at this time last year, but still far more than any other industry.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t include any lobby cash for medical devices and dietary supplements; that\u2019s just the money from drug makers.\n\nYes, prescription pills are big business in America.\n\nA National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, titled \u201cPrescription Drug Use in the United States,\u201d and published in May, revealed that between 2015 and 2016, nearly 46% of Americans used prescription drugs within the 30 days preceding the survey \u2014 18% of whom were children up to age 11 and 27%, adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19.\n\nThat\u2019s down from figures from 2007-2008, when the National Center for Health Statistics found 50% of Americans using one or more prescription drugs.\n\nThe question is: How much of this pill-popping is truly necessary?\n\nIn 2017, Consumer Reports ran a survey that found 55% of Americans were regularly taking prescription medication \u2014 and not just one pill, but rather, on average, four. Many of those surveyed also said they were taking various over-the-counter drugs and vitamins along with their prescribed medicines, a situation that can lead consumers down a risky path of mixing medicines that shouldn\u2019t be mixed.\n\nBut it\u2019s the sudden spike in prescriptions that\u2019s even more concerning.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2016, drug prescriptions for Americans rose by 85%, from 2.4 billion to 4.5 billion, Quintile IMS found, WebMD.com reported.\n\nSo is it that Americans are just getting sicker and medical researchers are getting better at their jobs? Or are there other factors at play \u2014 such as a trend toward prescribing pills simply because they\u2019re there to prescribe?\n\nHere\u2019s one clue: Consumer Reports, in its study, listed a dozen health conditions that are frequently treated with prescriptions but that could also be addressed via lifestyle changes. Among: ADHD, back and joint pain, dementia, milder forms of depression, heartburn, insomnia, low testosterone, bone loss, bladder overactivity, early onset diabetes, early onset high blood pressure, and obesity.\n\nTake ADHD.\n\nIn 2016, Stat News reported that about 75% of children diagnosed with ADHD were taking prescribed medicines. That\u2019s a heck of a market. And it\u2019s added up big. Between 2006 and 2015, sales of ADHD medicines nearly tripled, from $4.7 billion to $12.7 billion, IBISWorld researchers found.\n\nThat\u2019s just one ailment, one diagnosis, one drug.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved in the neighborhood of 1,500 drugs in its decadeslong history, the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society reported.\n\nThat\u2019s a big market.\n\nThat\u2019s a Big Pharma market.\n\nAnd that explains Big Pharma\u2019s number one spot on the D.C. lobby circuit.\n\nLet the consumer beware: Not all that ails necessarily requires pills.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
