Tips, comments, recipes? You know what's up. Thanks for waking up with us during these wild times.\n\nPresident Donald Trump. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nThe Investigations\n\nWELCOME TO WEEK III: President Trump went there in a late-night tweet by accusing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) of treason and calling for her impeachment.\n\nIt was completely unclear what Trump meant:\n\nNancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con, and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan \u201cWhistleblower\u201d & lawyer... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n....This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u201cColluded\u201d with them, must all be immediately Impeached! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nFact check: There are some basic factual problems with those tweets \u2014 first off, members of Congress can't be impeached. And while Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has said his committee counseled the whistleblower about how to file a complaint, there is no evidence the speaker was involved. That complaint has sparked an impeachment inquiry into Trump's calls for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.\n\nAnd a seemingly irate president is fighting back. Trump spent his weekend lashing out at Democrats, the whistleblower(s), Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Sunday show anchors and guests, and others who have refused to bend to his point of view.\n\nThe president's 60-plus tweets did not make up for the absence of administration officials who declined to appear on Sunday shows or the shaky defenses fronted by some GOP lawmakers struggling to navigate \u201ctheir political futures, legacies and, ultimately, their allegiance to a president who has held them captive,\u201d our colleagues Bob Costa and Phil Rucker report.\n\n\u201cTrump has been defiant in his defense, insisting his conduct with foreign leaders has been \u201cperfect\u201d and claiming a broad conspiracy by the Democratic Party, the intelligence community and the national media to remove him from office. Yet few Republican lawmakers have been willing to fully parrot White House talking points because they believe they lack credibility or fret they could be contradicted by new discoveries,\u201d per Bob and Phil.\n\nHere are just a few of this weekend's key developments:\n\n\u2014 On Sunday, it was revealed that a second whistleblower has spoken with the intelligence community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson.\n\n\u201cMark Zaid, the attorney representing the whistleblower who sounded the alarm on President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine and triggered an impeachment inquiry, tells ABC News that he is now representing a second whistleblower who has spoken with the inspector general,\u201d ABC News's James Gordon Meek and Anne Flaherty.\n\nZaid told ABC News's George Stephanopoulos the second whistleblower \u2014 \u201calso described as an intelligence official \u2014 has firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The AP scoops that a circle of GOP allies seeking business deals in Ukraine touted connections to Rudy Giuliani and Trump as they pushed for control of the government-owned gas company, Naftogaz, while Secretary of Energy Rick Perry was simultaneously efforting to replace board members of the massive firm.\n\n\u201cAs Rudy Giuliani was pushing Ukrainian officials last spring to investigate one of Donald Trump\u2019s main political rivals, a group of individuals with ties to the president and his personal lawyer were also active in the former Soviet republic,\u201d the Associated Press's Desmond Butler, Michael Biesecker and Richard Lardner report.\n\nKey: It's still unclear if the Perry and Giuliani allies were collaborating but \u201cthe affair shows how those with ties to Trump and his administration were pursuing business deals in Ukraine that went far beyond advancing the president\u2019s personal political interests. It also raises questions about whether Trump allies were mixing business and politics just as Republicans were calling for a probe of Biden and his son Hunter, who served five years on the board of another Ukrainian energy company, Burisma.\u201d\n\nIt's still unclear if the Perry and Giuliani allies were collaborating but \u201cthe affair shows how those with ties to Trump and his administration were pursuing business deals in Ukraine that went far beyond advancing the president\u2019s personal political interests.

For example, they told people that Trump would replace the U.S. ambassador there months before she was actually recalled to Washington, according to three of the individuals interviewed by the AP. One of the individuals said he was so concerned by the whole affair that he reported it to a U.S. Embassy official in Ukraine months ago.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Republican defense of Trump became even harder to follow.\n\nThe Ron Johnson defense : Meet the Press's Chuck Todd was incredulous after Senate Homeland and Government Security Chair Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) brought up Lisa Page and Peter Strzok and asked \u201cwho planted\u201d the story that Trump allegedly colluded with Russia to win the 2016 elections.\n\n: Meet the Press's Chuck Todd was incredulous after Senate Homeland and Government Security Chair Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) brought up Lisa Page and Peter Strzok and asked \u201cwho planted\u201d the story that Trump allegedly colluded with Russia to win the 2016 elections. Er, the question was: Todd asked why Johnson told the Wall Street Journal's Siobhan Hughes and Rebecca Ballhaus he \u201cwinced\u201d over a suggested made by the Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, that halted military aid to Ukraine was connected to a promise by Ukrainian President Zelensky for investigations.\n\nTodd asked why Johnson told the Wall Street Journal's Siobhan Hughes and Rebecca Ballhaus he \u201cwinced\u201d over a suggested made by the Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, that halted military aid to Ukraine was connected to a promise by Ukrainian President Zelensky for investigations. \u201cAnswer the question that I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you're not criticizing him,\u201d Todd told Johnson.\n\nLiterally but not seriously: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) echoed another defense Republican lawmakers are making after Trump publicly called on China to investigate Joe Biden and his son: Trump isn't serious.\n\n\u201cI think Sen. (Marco) Rubio said it a couple days ago, he's getting the press all spun up about this,\u201d Jordan told Stephanopoulus. Remember, this is the president who's been tougher on China than any other president.\u201d\n\nJordan refused to say whether he thought Trump's comments were right or wrong: \u201cWell, I don't think it's going to happen. \u2026 I just don't think that's what the president was really saying.\u201d\n\nWATCH: @SenRonJohnson is asked why he winced.@chucktodd: \"I have no idea why we're going here. ... Can we please answer the question I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you're not criticizing him?\" #MTP pic.twitter.com/52ZbGaybhI \u2014 Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) October 6, 2019\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

We don't know the identities of all the call's participants, for instance, which could help explain why the normally routine communication between two world leaders appears to have been placed on a highly secure server to limit access.\n\nHere's what we do know: Per the whistleblower's complaint, \u201capproximately a dozen\u201d White House officials were listening in on the call \u2014 \u201ca mixture of policy officials and duty officers in the White House Situation Room, as is customary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe officials I spoke with told me that participation in the call had not been restricted in advance because everyone expected it would be a \u201croutine\u201d call with a foreign leader. I do not know whether anyone was physically present with the President during the call.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Trump and Zelensky, we know of three other people in on the conversation \u2014 along with \u201cvery talented stenographers.\u201d\n\nKeith Kellogg Jr.: A retired lieutenant general and Vice President Pence's national security adviser.

What does this mean for Kurdish forces?: \"A senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an evolving situation, said the U.S. government 'has no idea' what the Turkish operation would look like, whether it would be a small, symbolic incursion or a major offensive intended to push 30 or 40 kilometers into Syria,\" our colleagues write.\n\n\"A senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an evolving situation, said the U.S. government 'has no idea' what the Turkish operation would look like, whether it would be a small, symbolic incursion or a major offensive intended to push 30 or 40 kilometers into Syria,\" our colleagues write.

(Pat Sullivan, File/AP)\n\nGlobal Power\n\nNBA IGNITES FIRESTORM OVER HONG KONG: Democratic presidential candidates and Republican lawmakers have lashed out at the NBA over the decision to distance itself from a Houston Rockets executive\u2019s tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. This is far from the first time an American company or for that matter major-global brand has had to correct itself to stay in Beijing\u2019s good graces.\n\nWhat happened: The Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted on Friday to \u201cstand with Hong Kong\u201d then quickly deleted the message. But the damage was done as the Times\u2019s Sopan Deb reports. The Chinese consulate general in Houston released a statement expressing its \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d and urged the team to take \u201cimmediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact.\u201d\n\nIt was the response of the NBA and the Rockets that caused much of the angry reaction in the U.S. as lawmakers pointed to fears that China was effectively silencing the First Amendment rights of an American citizen.\n\nThe problem: The league released a statement calling Morey's tweet \u201cregrettable\u201d and said the GM's views \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\u201d That response followed the Rockets\u2019 owner who immediately rebuked Morey on Friday night. Morey tried to quell the situation himself on Sunday by issuing a pair of new tweets, but did not apologize for his original remarks.\n\nThe league released a statement calling Morey's tweet \u201cregrettable\u201d and said the GM's views \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\u201d That response followed the Rockets\u2019 owner who immediately rebuked Morey on Friday night.

As Deb points out, \u201cBasketball has long been China\u2019s most popular sport and the N. B. A has made great efforts to cultivate the audience there, with a market that features hundreds of millions of fans. But the NBA has also been more open than other major sports leagues in letting its coaches and players express their political views.\n\nNoted Rockets fan Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) blasted the league. Florida Sen. Rick Scott called the statement \"an absolute joke.\"\n\nWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nAndrew Yang was the first presidential candidate to weigh in.

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nFrom the Courts\n\nSCOTUS COULD FACE SOME OF ITS MOST POLITICAL CASES IN YEARS: It's the first Monday in October. \u201cThe Supreme Court has a powerfully controversial docket for its term beginning [today] that will test Chief Justice John Roberts efforts to portray the institution as above the noisy and partisan battles of the moment,\u201d our colleague Robert Barnes reports.\n\nHere are some of the major cases the court is already schedule to hear:\n\nWhether federal law protects LGBTQ workers from discrimination or being fired.\n\nWhether the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to end the Obama-era program protecting immigrants brought to this country as children is lawful.\n\nThe first Second Amendment claim involving gun ownership in more than a decade.\n\nWhether a state may withhold aid to private religious schools if it offers funding to secular ones.\n\nAn abortion case that gives the court\u2019s new conservatives an opportunity to begin reconstructing its jurisprudence on what is perhaps the nation\u2019s most divisive subject.\n\nYou'll notice there's a big potential case missing: The third potential Supreme Court case regarding the Affordable Care Act could be added later, as the potential effect of such a ruling during the height of the 2020 campaign has already been subject of speculation. The other potential bombshell(s) could come if any of the lawsuits between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration, including over the president's tax returns, wind their way through the system.\n\nWhat the experts are watching: \u201cThe conservative majority \u2014 bolstered by [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s other appointee \u2014 is in position to be more assertive this term, according to those who watch the court,\u201d our colleague writes. Of course, the health of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also remains a major question, though \u201cshe has counteracted the worries about her condition with an impressive show of vigor: nearly a dozen speaking engagements over the past month-plus,\u201d our colleague writes.\n\nViral", "description": "Lawmakers cannot be impeached.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Alemany", "Anchor Of Power Up", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/e62af1a59a793e9c7b5646657c09c9eb-2608-1736-70-8-THNTTKXIIEI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
