And then, coming so close to the camera that all you could see was his mouth, he rapped: \u201cI killed my b---- and buried that b---- in the f------ dirt.\u201d\n\nThe other men grimaced. One let out a nervous laugh. Camou floated away to the outskirts of the group, appearing to realize his mistake. \u201cThe cops are trying to look for me,\u201d he rapped, \u201cand I\u2019m \u2026 trying to shut my mouth.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Disturbing video shows man appearing to be 27-year-old Robert Camou rapping about killing someone and burying them in the dirt the same night his girlfriend, 31-year-old Amanda Custer vanished https://t.co/oCPpSYgsfF pic.twitter.com/MkKasDlf1G \u2014 CBS Los Angeles (@CBSLA) August 1, 2019\n\nAt that point, it didn\u2019t matter. The cops had already traced his movements and were scouring the streets of Los Angeles for his gray Toyota Prius. Hours earlier, his own parents had called the police on him. They found blood and signs of a brutal assault against Camou\u2019s girlfriend, 31-year-old Amanda Custer, inside his bedroom. Neighbors told police they saw Camou dragging her lifeless body into the cargo hatch of his car.\n\nBut when police finally found Camou\u2019s Prius in the early morning hours of July 30, parked half a mile from King Eddy, Custer wasn\u2019t in there anymore. Instead, they found Camou sleeping in the back seat. And blood in the back cargo space, as well as a \u201ctool used for digging,\u201d police said last month.\n\nAnd then, in a matter of days, they would also find the rap video, believing it told them everything they needed to know.\n\nOn Wednesday, Camou was charged with capital murder in his missing girlfriend\u2019s death after extensive searches for Custer\u2019s body in canyons and creeks all over the Los Angeles area failed, the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office announced. The murder charge was also enhanced with a special circumstance because Camou was out on bail on a domestic violence case involving Custer at the time he allegedly killed her.\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department investigators said they have authenticated the rap video filmed at King Eddy Saloon, suggesting it can be used against Camou in court. The man who filmed it, 64-year-old Michael R. Moore, told the Los Angeles Times he realized Camou was the same disturbing rapper from the bar after seeing him in handcuffs on the news the next morning.\n\n\u201cWhat he said, he said it with such force that people just stopped,\u201d Moore told the Times. \u201cThey were shocked. There was a lot of hate in his expression.\u201d\n\nCuster had been warning courts of Camou\u2019s abusive behavior for months before her death, revealing a tumultuous relationship that at times turned violent, as the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nIn April 2018, Custer\u2019s grandmother sought a restraining order against Camou, saying Custer had been choked and attacked, leaving her face bloodied, the Times reported. He kept driving past their house harassing them, the grandmother said. But her petition was denied in May 2018.\n\nIn February, Custer filed for a restraining order against Camou as well, telling the court that he had been harassing her with texts and phone calls using \u201cover 100 fake numbers,\u201d the Times reported. Then, she wrote in court documents, he jumped a fence and tried to break into her bedroom. She wouldn\u2019t let Camou in \u2014 only to look outside later to find him returning with a hatchet. She said he used it to hack the side mirrors off her grandmother\u2019s car, and then busted through her bedroom window.\n\nCuster also said she knew Camou had a 12-gauge shotgun and a handgun, which made her afraid for her dog, Piper.\n\n\u201cI also think he would go as far as hurting her or killing her to hurt me,\u201d she wrote in the petition, according to the Times.\n\nAgain, the judge denied her petition that same month.\n\nThe turning point came on April 22. Camou allegedly beat Custer, strangling her and threatening her with a Taser, prosecutors said. Custer fled and \u201csought help at a nearby residence.\u201d But Camou followed. He allegedly then attacked an elderly man inside the home who tried to intervene.\n\nCamou was charged with first-degree burglary, injuring a girlfriend and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury in both of those alleged beatings.\n\n\u201cAt the arraignment, our office requested that bail be set at $150,000, but over the prosecutor\u2019s objections, the court released the defendant on electronic monitoring,\u201d Paul Eakins, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office, told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune. \u201cThe prosecutor requested a protective order, which the court issued.\u201d\n\nOn the day Custer disappeared, July 29, probation officers noticed something was wrong with Camou\u2019s electronic monitor: The battery was going out. The department notified the court, saying he had absconded from the electronic monitoring program, or EMP, the Tribune reported. The court issued a bench warrant, but it was too late.\n\nHours later, he would rap at the King Eddy Saloon: \u201cI cut the f------ EMP off my leg and then I\u2019m out.\u201d\n\nWhen police tried to arrest him as he slept in his Prius down the block from the bar, he refused to get out. The standoff lasted five hours \u2014 ending with the Los Angeles Police Department SWAT team tossing a canister of tear gas at him.\n\nFor weeks, as Camou remained in jail, Custer\u2019s family kept hope that she might still be alive. Her father, Rick, stood before reporters asking hikers, fishers and mountain bikers in the area to help find her. \u201cWe are pleading with anybody who might have a tip that might help to report it, as we are very distraught, and need to bring our Amanda home,\u201d he said in a handwritten note dated Aug. 4.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Los Angeles County district attorney said her body still had not been found.\n\nCamou faces either the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted. The decision on whether to seek the death penalty will be made at a later date, the office said.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nConservative activist Jacob Wohl charged with felony in California\n\nThe FBI\u2019s terror watch list violates the Constitution, federal judge says\n\n\u2018I smacked my lips\u2019: Rep.
