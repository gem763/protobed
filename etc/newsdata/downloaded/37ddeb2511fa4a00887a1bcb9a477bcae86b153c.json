Indigenous demonstrators have blocked roads and highways in the country and thousands have travelled to the capital Quito ahead of large protests planned for Wednesday.\n\nThe unrest has resulted in clashes with security forces, while some of the road blockages have affected petrol deliveries, leading to fuel shortages in parts of the country.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tear gas was fired as protests flared in Ecuador last week\n\nInterior Minister Paula Romo told Radio Quito on Monday that there had been 477 arrests since Thursday, mainly for vandalism.\n\nMr Moreno has declared a two-month national emergency over the unrest.\n\nWhy did the president scrap the subsidies?\n\nMr Moreno said the fuel subsidies, which cost the government $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) annually, were no longer affordable.\n\nThe elimination of the subsidies, introduced in the 1970s, are part of his plan to shore up Ecuador's flagging economy and ease its debt burden.\n\nEcuador's government has agreed to cut public spending as part of a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe agreement, signed in March, allows Ecuador to borrow $4.2bn (\u00a33.4bn).", "description": "The president has moved the government to the port city of Guayaquil amid continued fuel protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1B8E/production/_109145070_93eea26f-c341-4c80-a3d1-3b5113ef5679.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
