I\u2019m telling you, it is my humble opinion that that little two-year escapade is not forgotten, is not going to be forgotten,\" Limbaugh said on his radio show Monday.\n\nLimbaugh was reacting to a tweet by New York Times opinion columnist David Leonhardt noting that Democrats were looking less favorable to Americans.\n\nFLYNN LAWYER AT WAR WITH MUELLER TEAM, ACCUSING PROSECUTORS OF \u2018MALEVOLENT CONDUCT\u2019\n\n\"A year ago - in the midst of the midterm campaign - Americans viewed the Democratic Party more favorably than the Republican Party. No longer,\" Leonhardt tweeted. \"It's time for Democrats to stop messing around with unpopular technocratic ideas. Focus on beating Trump.\"\n\nThe tweet, which included a link to his column on the topic, also included graphics showing Pew Research Center data on both political parties favorability in September of 2018 and September 2019. Democrats held a 53 percent to 43 percent favorability rating over Republicans a year ago. That gap has vanished and both parties have a 45 percent favorability.\n\n\"You have to remember: They promised people, they assured people, Trump was toast. Trump was gone. Trump had colluded,\" Limbaugh said in response to the information.\n\nLimbaugh believes Democrats are paying a price for the Mueller report not coming through for the president's detractors.\n\n\"Two years of this, and then the big reveal with the Mueller report and... nothing. That didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. There will be a price to pay for this, and the Democrats are seen as being responsible for it,\" Limbaugh said.\n\nThe radio host also pointed out that media will pay a price with Americans who no longer trust them over their coverage of the Russia investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"There may be no accountability \u2014 the media may not be apologizing, may not be asking their audiences for forgiveness \u2014 but I\u2019m telling you: Large swaths of their audiences don\u2019t trust them as far as they can throw them today,\" Limbaugh said.", "description": "Are Democrats and the media paying the price for pushing the Russia collusion narrative for more than two years? \u00a0According to conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, they are.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Limbaugh-DNC-CNN-MSNBC_FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
