He and Ms. Giffords co-founded Americans for Responsible Solutions, now called Giffords, a nonprofit and super PAC that promotes gun safety.\n\nRecently, the head of the Arizona Republican Party, Kelli Ward, sent out a fund-raising note saying supporters needed to stop Mr. Kelly \u201cdead in his tracks,\u201d which stirred criticism. (Mr. Kelly sent his own fund-raising message to supporters highlighting the attack.)\n\n\u201cThe fact that Mark Kelly\u2019s wife is one of the most famous shooting victims here plays a role,\u201d said Paul Bentz, a pollster and consultant here. But, Mr. Bentz added, \u201cI just don\u2019t think he wants to be defined by the issue.\u201d\n\nMs. McSally, a retired fighter pilot and former House member who was appointed last year to fill out the late Senator John McCain\u2019s term, has been evolving on her gun positions since the summer\u2019s shootings, and as Mr. Trump has called vaguely for tougher gun laws.", "description": "As the Senate contemplates new gun laws in the wake of mass shootings, gun control is not an issue Mark Kelly and Martha McSally can easily avoid.", "authors": ["Jennifer Steinhauer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/us/politics/00ARIZONA-01/merlin_161082957_f836f525-9aa6-4974-95a6-0e522de6787e-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
