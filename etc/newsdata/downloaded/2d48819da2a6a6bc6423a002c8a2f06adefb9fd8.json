Show me your hands.\u201d He then suddenly fires through the window at Jefferson.\n\nOfficers were responding to a nonemergency call from a neighbor who saw an open front door and lights on at the house. In their initial statement, police said Dean fired after \u201cperceiving a threat.\u201d\n\nJefferson\u2019s family held a press conference Monday and called for an independent investigation into a \u201creckless act.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was enjoying a life in her home, where no one would have expected her life to be in harm\u2019s way, especially not at the hands of a civil servant who has taken an oath to serve and protect,\u201d Jefferson\u2019s sister Ashley Carr said.\n\nFamily attorney Lee Merritt said that Jefferson had been playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew, and approached the window to investigate a noise outside when Dean fired.\n\nMerritt also lambasted the police department\u2019s decision to release blurred still frames of a gun inside a bedroom along with the body cam footage. Officials have not said whether Dean thought Jefferson was holding a gun, nor whether the gun was found near her. Fort Worth Lieutenant Brandon O\u2019Neil refused to comment to reporters Sunday on why police released images of the gun, which was legally owned by Jefferson.\n\nNews of the tragedy comes only weeks after the murder trial of Amber Guyger in another high-profile police shooting. Guyger was sentenced to ten years in prison after being found guilty of murdering Botham Jean in his own home.", "description": "A Fort Worth, Texas police officer resigned Monday morning after fatally shooting a 28-year old black woman through the window of her mother\u2019s home this past weekend.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
