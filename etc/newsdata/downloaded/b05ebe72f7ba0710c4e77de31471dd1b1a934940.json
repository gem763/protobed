(You can find more details about Trump\u2019s speech and executive order here or here.)\n\nNone of the changes in Trump\u2019s order will take effect right away, as they all allow for new proposals or rules to be developed over time. But here are four immediate takeaways:\n\nTrump as protector of Medicare might be a problem for conservatives: Ronald Reagan decried Medicare as socialism in the mid-1960s. Now Trump says he is protecting Medicare against socialism in the form of Democratic Medicare-for-All plans. \u201cTrump positioned himself as the guardian of the government healthcare program for seniors that Republicans originally opposed as socialism and have long sought to overhaul,\u201d the Washington Examiner\u2019s Kimberly Leonard notes. \u201cConservatives generally point out that Medicare faces significant funding problems and that it's one of the biggest drivers of the country's debt.\u201d But Trump\u2019s positioning could undercut future GOP efforts to change Medicare.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t do much to really protect Medicare longer-term: \u201cWhen asked about how the Trump administration would help assure Medicare's sustainability in the long term, something officials said was part of the president's executive order, health officials pointed to reductions in premiums for prescription drugs and reductions in \u2018burdensome\u2019 regulations,\u201d Leonard writes. \u201cSeema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said on Twitter that overhauling regulations would save almost $6 billion over the next decade.\u201d But Medicare\u2019s projected financing shortfall is much, much bigger than that, totaling some $40 trillion over the next 75 years.\n\nTrump might actually be undermining traditional Medicare: \u201cTrump\u2019s executive order is a stealth attack on the very program he\u2019s swearing to protect,\u201d Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik says. \u201cBuried within the order is a provision that would destroy Medicare by driving its costs to an unsustainable level.\u201d\n\nThat provision orders the secretary of Health and Human Services to study ways to modify traditional Medicare payments \u201cto more closely reflect\u201d Medicare Advantage and private insurance prices. Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation warned on Twitter that the pricing provision \u201cwould increase the cost of Medicare enormously, since private insurers pay much higher prices than Medicare.\u201d And Hiltzik argues that \u201cit makes no sense to tie Medicare prices to a market model that so relentlessly inflates costs and thereby collects fatter profits for private participants.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Loren Adler, associate director of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, suggests that the language in the Trump executive order reads like its goal \u201cis to make Medicare much, much more expensive by providing a huge windfall to hospitals.\u201d But, he adds, there may be another way to read the order: \u201cThe alternative reading here is that the intent is just to apply private insurance prices to Medicare when they're lower, which I hope is the case. We'll see when this study comes out.\u201d\n\nSetting aside that provision, the Trump administration\u2019s push for Medicare Advantage plans raises alarms among some Medicare advocates that it\u2019s pursuing stealth privatization of the traditional health-care program for seniors.\n\nThere\u2019s less here than Trump would like you to believe: What Trump laid out was \u201ca fairly normal, fairly vague policy statement with no real implications for 2020,\u201d Axios\u2019s Caitlin Owens writes. Yes, Trump\u2019s push to expand private Medicare Advantage plans over traditional Medicare matters, and it has implications for federal spending, given questions over how effective private Medicare plans are at containing costs. But Trump didn\u2019t announce any new plans to lower drug prices. And he did little to detail an alternative big-picture vision for the U.S. health-care system or to address the broad systemic questions plaguing the health-care industry. \u201cPlenty of what the Trump administration has said is hyperbole, untrue or unknowable,\u201d Owens writes. \u201cAnd the policy the administration rolled out has little to do with these big-picture issues.\u201d\n\nLike what you're reading?
