Once you get over the \u201calways being wrong\u201d part, you can take comfort in the fact that the media will do all it can to cover for your failures. They\u2019ll ignore your problems. Hell, they\u2019ll even lie on your behalf. It has to be nice.\n\nThat instinct to protect Democrats is about all that\u2019s keeping Joe Biden\u2019s fading hopes of winning the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination alive.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the Democratic Party is in love with the former vice president. They know they have a campaigning disaster on their hands who is unburdened by reality and willing to say anything to get elected but they also know he has the highest name ID and is the most electable in the general election.\n\nThe best thing Joe Biden has going for him is he\u2019s affable, a goofy kind of guy people like personally, no matter what craziness comes out of his mouth. The worst thing he has going for him is the seemingly unbreakable string of craziness that comes out of his mouth.\n\nIn 2012, I wrote about Biden\u2019s long, storied history of absurdity and lies. \u201cHe could say something absurd, such as \u201cI think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect.\u201d Then he could rattle off a list of academic scholarships he earned, how he didn\u2019t really care his first year of law school but then started to and graduated in the top half of his class, etc. Only it\u2019s all a lie. He eventually has to admit it was all a lie. His scholarship was based on need, not academics, he didn\u2019t graduate in the top half of his class \u2013 he was 76th out of 85\u2026\u201d\n\nGiven this history, it\u2019s worth noting that he\u2019s not being called a \u201cliar\u201d by anyone in the legacy media.\n\nThe Washington Post has made a cottage industry out of \u201ccounting Trump\u2019s lies.\u201d The meticulously \u201cfact-check\u201d everything he\u2019s said, compiling them in a database. Journalists and TV personalities cite this list as proof that \u201cTrump is different from other politicians\u201d based on the volume of \u201clies.\u201d\n\nWhat constitutes a fact-check worthy lie, according to the Post? When the president said, \u201cThe weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Administration allowed bad MS-13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!\u201d\n\nWhat did the Post write in declaring this \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d? Their \u201cfact-check\u201d reads, \u201cThe MS-13 gang far predates Obama, and has been active since the 1980s. According to the Congressional Research Service in 2005 and 2008, the gang had spread across the country since the 1980s. Moreover, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump has been arresting an increasing number of noncriminals, indicating that it's not just the gang members that are being targeted by his administration.\u201d\n\nAbsolutely nothing in what President Trump said is false or misleading. That MS-13 predated Obama is irrelevant to what he said, as is the year they came into being. And \u201cnoncriminal\u201d illegal aliens is an oxymoron.\n\nSo how did the Post treat Biden when he told an incredibly offensive, stolen valor-by-proxy lie about him awarding a medal to a soldier in an active war zone who didn\u2019t feel he deserved it? They reported, \u201cIn the space of three minutes, Biden got the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony.\u201d\n\nBut did they use the word \u201clie\u201d? Nope. Not in the headline, which said \u201cBiden tells a moving but false war story,\u201d and nowhere in the piece. He was just confused, mixing in pieces of other stories, putting himself at the center of an event he was not involved in.\n\nWhether it was an embellishment, conflating several stories, or flat-out lying doesn\u2019t matter. If Donald Trump had said it, the Post wouldn\u2019t have been able to contain their glee over calling it a lie.\n\nBiden\u2019s history is riddled with these sorts of \u201cexaggerations,\u201d yet somehow the \u201chandsy\u201d guy who sniffs women\u2019s hair and gets a little too friendly with young women is given a pass.\n\nAt least the Post reported it, even if they painted Joe in the most favorable light possible. That fact, and not his lack of the grasp of them, should worry Biden the most. No candidate or news outlet wants to be the one to knock him out of the race. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they want him gone, but they don\u2019t want to be the one to do it. People like him. Years of friendly, PR-level press coverage has made an impression on Democratic voters. A campaign death-blow would rebound unfavorably on the person who lands it. So they\u2019re going for the \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d approach, hoping he simply implodes.\n\nOf course, the one person recklessly wielding the sharpest knife is Biden. It\u2019s just a question of whether or not the media will honestly report about the deep cuts he regularly inflicts on himself.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "It\u2019s got to be good to be a Democrat.
