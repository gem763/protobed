But on Sunday, all of Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lallana made a difference.\n\nIn fact, Lallana's goal was the first by a Liverpool replacement since the Champions League final, when Divock Origi secured No 6 in Madrid.\n\n2) First it was Virgil van Dijk, then Fabinho. Both used their superior size to crunch Daniel James and remind him of the physical realities of top-level football. A week earlier he had been left in a heap during Wales' clash with Croatia.\n\nHis fine assist for Rashford's goal ensured James repaid Solskjaer's faith once more. But United may think about protecting him - or bulking him up - before he is seriously hurt.\n\nDaniel James (left, pictured bloodied on the turf) needs to bulk up or face being bullied\n\n3) Not many teams force Klopp to change tack. His teams are easy to predict: even when injuries occur, he rarely strays from 4-3-3 and backs his trusted core group to outplay any side. And why wouldn't he?\n\nOld Trafford seems to have a hold over him, though. Last year he dropped Trent Alexander-Arnold following his struggles against Rashford and this year an injury to Mo Salah prompted him to push Jordan Henderson out to the right in a more 4-2-3-1.\n\nJurgen Klopp seems to have a hold over Jurgen Klopp, as he's forced to switch his team around\n\nMATCH FACTS Manchester United (3-5-2) : De Gea; Maguire, Lindelof, Rojo; Young, Fred, McTominay, Pereira (Williams 90+4), Wan-Bisakka; James, Rashford (Martial 84) Subs not used: Garner, Greenwood, Mata, Rojo, Romero Booked: N/A Goals: Rashford (37) Manager: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Liverpool (4-3-3): Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum (Keita 82); Mane, Firmino, Origi (Oxlade-Chamberlain 60) Subs not used: Gomez, Lallana, Lovren, Milner, Adrian Booked: Fabinho Goals: Lallana (85) Manager: Jurgen Klopp Referee: Martin Atkinson Stadium: Old Trafford\n\n4) Solskjaer also tried something new and the United boss must be praised for bravely mixing up his tactics when so much was at stake. Given United's current plight, it was a huge call to go for three at the back for the first time this season - and in such a crucial game. The result may not have gone their way, but Solskjaer has not lost any of his self-belief and in large parts his was a gamble that paid off.\n\n5) Football fans loathe to be told what their sport can learn from rugby. But hear me out. This year's Rugby World Cup has been dominated by referee's interpretations of high tackles and the clarity provided by hearing conversations between officials, the TMO and players is a world away from the confusion that followed United's opener. It's something football must look at if VAR is to work.\n\n6) United and Solskjaer were rightly praised for the way they changed system to nullify a lot of Liverpool's threat - and stifle the forward work of their full-backs. But still Andy Robertson provided the crucial assist for Lallana's late equaliser.\n\nThe Scot now has 14 Premier League assists since the start of last season. Alexander-Arnold is the only defender who can match him. How do you stop them?\n\nAndy Robertson now has 14 assists since the start of last season and is in wonderful form\n\n7) Is Marcus Rashford a big-game player, or simply a horses for courses striker? After five club games without a goal, he broke his duck against of the division's joint-tightest defence, meaning eleven of his 31 Premier League goals have come against the 'big six'.\n\nMore than anything, that suggests he's at his best when United don't have to break down deep defences, when he has more space in behind. But it's games against the lesser teams that will define United's season.\n\nMarcus Rashford, who netted for United, must prove that he's not just a big-game player\n\n8) His heroics against Barcelona and Tottenham mean Origi's place in Liverpool folklore is safe. His performance on Sunday, however, was more befitting of what fans have come to expect.\n\nThe Belgian, replacing Mo Salah, was a peripheral figure for most of the game and when he was involved, he often slowed down Liverpool's attacks. Come January or the summer Klopp shouldn't let romance get in the way of improving his attacking options.\n\nDivock Origi will go down in Liverpool history for past heroics, but he was a peripheral figure\n\n9) No Premier League team has dropped more than the eight points Manchester United have squandered from winning positions this season. It's a puzzling statistic.\n\nSolskjaer has supposedly built a team designed to kill teams on the counter. But when they give themselves a lead - and the platform to flourish - they seem to go into their shell.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's team seem to go into their shell when they have built themselves a lead\n\n10) His words must be taken with a pinch of salt, or two. But did Klopp have a point when he said United are interested only in defending against his side? The statistics certainly don't make pretty reading.\n\nUnited managed only 32.1 per cent possession on Sunday, their second lowest figure in a home league game since 2003-04. The only time they have enjoyed less of the ball (32.06 per cent) in that time was against Liverpool in 2018. It's working, I suppose.", "description": "Liverpool were denied a record-equalling 18th straight Premier League win by rivals Manchester United on Sunday.\u00a0Here, Sportsmail runs through 10 things we learned from the Old Trafford stalemate.", "authors": ["Daniel Matthews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/10/19983534-0-image-a-57_1571649570902.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
