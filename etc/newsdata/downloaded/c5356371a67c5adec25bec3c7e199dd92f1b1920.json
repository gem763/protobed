The Nationals would enter their best-of-five series against the defending World Series champion Cardinals without the services of Stephen Strasburg, who pitched 159\u2153 innings in his first full season after Tommy John surgery but was shut down in early September in the interest of reducing his risk of suffering another serious injury.\n\n\u201cThe coming days, starting Sunday afternoon, should provide an agonizing, thrilling, exhausting level of uncertainty and tension that many fans don\u2019t even know exists in sports, certainly not in baseball, a game that, in D.C., has been a sleepy endeavor for 79 years,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Thomas Boswell wrote. \u201cFor relentless sensory bombardment, for hair-yanking twists of fortune, for sudden utterly unexpected explosions of joy, there\u2019s nothing like playoff baseball.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at the Nationals\u2019 first postseason series, which had everything Boswell promised and more.\n\nThe Nationals overcame seven walks by starter Gio Gonzalez and 10 strikeouts in 5\u2154 innings by his counterpart, Cardinals ace Adam Wainwright, to steal a win in the opener at Busch Stadium. Jayson Werth robbed Daniel Descalso of a two-run homer in the sixth inning to prevent St. Louis from extending its 2-1 lead, and Tyler Moore delivered a two-out, two-run, pinch-hit single in the eighth. Nationals closer Drew Storen retired the Cardinals in order in an uneventful ninth to secure Washington\u2019s first playoff win.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope they\u2019re not all like that,\u201d Nationals first baseman Adam LaRoche said. \u201cBut yeah, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re pretty fired up back home. It looked like we were dead there for a while. To come back with one big swing, it\u2019s big.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Cardinals tagged Nationals starter Jordan Zimmermann for five runs on seven hits in three innings and hit four home runs en route to a comfortable Game 2 win that evened the series.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re going to score runs as the game goes on,\u201d Werth said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bang with them. They got out in front in the early part, and they just kept pouring on runs. If we can be in the ballgame as the game goes on, we got a shot. I like our chances.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals took a 4-0 lead against starter Edwin Jackson in the second inning on the strength of rookie infielder Pete Kozma\u2019s three-run homer. That was more than enough run support for St. Louis\u2019s Chris Carpenter, who shut out the Nationals on seven hits over 5\u2154 innings. Relievers Trevor Rosenthal, Fernando Salas and Joe Kelly combined to complete the shutout and push Washington to the brink of elimination. Incidentally, Rosenthal and Kelly would both figure prominently in the Nationals\u2019 current season, with the latter serving up Howie Kendrick\u2019s go-ahead grand slam in the 10th inning on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t jump off a bridge,\u201d General Manager Mike Rizzo said afterward. \u201cWe\u2019ve won two in a row before.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter an unlikely pitcher\u2019s duel between Kyle Lohse and Ross Detwiler, the teams entered the bottom of the ninth tied 1-1. Werth led off the inning against Lance Lynn, and on the 13th pitch of the at-bat, sent a 96-mph fastball over the wall in left field for a game-winning home run. The ballpark erupted in celebration of what was, perhaps until this season, the biggest hit in Nationals history.\n\n\u201cWe get to play tomorrow,\u201d Werth said afterward. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part.\u201d\n\nThe deciding game in D.C. could not have started off much better for the Nationals. Rookie Bryce Harper and Michael Morse both homered in the third inning off Wainwright to stake Gonzalez to a 6-0 lead. The Cardinals would score the next five runs, but after Kurt Suzuki\u2019s RBI single in the eighth, Storen took the mound in the ninth inning with a 7-5 lead.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStoren allowed a leadoff double to Carlos Beltran before retiring Matt Holliday on a groundout and striking out Allen Craig. Sotren got to two strikes on the next two batters, Yadier Molina and David Freese, but walked them both to load the bases. Descalso followed with a one-hopper up the middle that deflected off Ian Desmond\u2019s glove and into center field, allowing the tying runs to score. Kozma delivered the final blow, a two-run single to right for his fourth and fifth RBI of the series. Jason Motte retired the Nationals in order in the bottom of the ninth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bad taste in my mouth,\u201d Storen said after the heart-wrenching loss. \u201cIt\u2019s going to stay there for a couple months, and it\u2019s probably never going to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can see the see finish line and taste it,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cYou\u2019re an out or two or a pitch or two away. And you don\u2019t win it. You got to get all 27 outs before you can pack up the bats. We don\u2019t know what to do tomorrow. It\u2019s Saturday, and we don\u2019t have a game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe defeat was the first of four losses in the NLDS for the Nationals over the next six years, with all but one of them coming in a Game 5 at home. While several Cardinals fans have suggested the team invite Kozma to throw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 1 of the NLCS, he can\u2019t hurt the Nationals on the field in the rematch. Meanwhile, Washington has a healthy Strasburg in their corner and the burden of past playoff failures off their backs.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "From Jayson Werth to Pete Kozma to the Strasburg Shutdown, the first Nationals-Cardinals series had it all.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
