The pieces tell some of the stories of the 70.8 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide, according to a United Nations Refugee Agency statistic.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a survey on the complicated topic of migration, displacement and immigration of people,\u201d said co-curator Eva Respini. \u201cInstead, we wanted to have a focused look through this moment right now. It\u2019s a signpost of these ideas always through the lens of art and artists.\u201d\n\nThe first thing viewers see upon entering the exhibition is Woven Chronicle, an artwork by Indian artist Reena Saini Kallat, created between the years 2011 and 2016. It\u2019s a wall map made of yarn, tracking the global routes where migrants have traveled; from contract workers to refugees and asylum seekers. Though the artwork was completed in 2016, the artist keeps updating it to trace new routes.\n\n\u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve tried to incorporate changes by updating the research,\u201d said Kallat, who has updated the map with the territorial split between Sudan and South Sudan. \u201cEven though the work is not meant to be an illustration of the numbers of refugees, as we have more data coming in, I keep trying to update the information we have in the archives,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe Kurdish artist Hayv Kahraman is showing Bab el Sheikh from 2013, an oil on wood wall piece showing a person either descending or ascending a staircase. As a refugee who left Iraq as a child, then moved through Europe and then the US, it\u2019s what co-curator Ruth Erickson calls \u201ca memory of home, reflecting on her own experience as a refugee\u201d.\n\nThe Palestinian artist Mona Hatoum is showing Exodus II from 2002, a sculpture that connects a pair of suitcases with strands of hair, suggesting separation from familial roots.\n\nAlso on view are landscape photographs by the California-based artist Richard Misrach, who documented the 2,000-mile border between the US and Mexico for his series Border Cantos from 2004 to 2016.\n\nThe Irish artist Richard Mosse is showing a three-channel video called Incoming, which was created between 2014 and 2017. \u201cIt tracks the route of refugees from North Africa and Middle East to Europe, mostly over water, landing on shores of southern Europe and making their way through refugee camps,\u201d said Respini.\n\nOne of the most recurrent images in the exhibition is the sea. \u201cThe site of the sea, the migration route and the refugee camp all play a role here,\u201d said Erickson.\n\nThe Moroccan artist Yto Barrada is showing works from her series, A Life Full of Holes: The Strait Project, which the artist created between 1998 and 2003. Today, this part of the Mediterranean sea, the Strait of Gibraltar is the route to the south of Spain\u2019s Andalusia region, which sees more migrant arrivals than anywhere else in Europe, making it especially timely.\n\nThe Dutch photographer Rineke Dijkstra is showing works from her Almerisa series, which sees her photographing a Bosnian refugee woman over the course of 14 years, first as a child, and now as a mother.\n\nThere\u2019s also a new site-specific, community project by the Boston-based artist Anthony Romero, who collaborated with the immigrant community in east Boston. \u201cHe did a series of listening sessions, which are immigration stories,\u201d said Erickson. \u201cThese audio recordings are a kind of community archiving for east Boston residents, story sharing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the museum overlooks the Boston harbor, which faces the Atlantic Ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s a big theme that comes out of our desire to think about our museum site-specifically,\u201d said Respini.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re perched on the Boston harbor, and everyone who visits us can see a dramatic view on top of the water. We\u2019re dealing with perilous crossings over sea, a middle passage, we thought it felt right for our building, it\u2019s so prevalent today.\u201d", "description": "In a new exhibition in Boston, brings together 20 years of artists exploring issues of displacement and immigrationReena Saini Kallat \u2013 Woven Chronicle.
