And you just have moments thinking, \u2018Oh, this is a really good reminder of how it should be\u2019.\u201d\n\nChristine joined the likes of GMB\u2019s Susanna Reid on the panel to debate potential winners from a host of stories of courageous acts and selfless work.\n\n\u201cI take being an ambassador very seriously because of course it means a great deal to those who win in the end.\n\n\u201cSo I read everything about the nominees. And every time you read one you think, \u2018Well it doesn\u2019t get any better than that. That\u2019s extraordinary.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou flip the page and then suddenly there\u2019s a whole other story that you think, \u2018Well that\u2019s amazing as well\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe final selection process was very hard as everyone was a worthy winner in reality.\u201d\n\nAnd Christine thinks that becoming a mum to Patricia may make it harder than ever to hold back tears at the Pride Of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, on Monday night.\n\n\u201cI definitely think I\u2019m much more emotional. I cry more easily without a doubt.\n\n\"And I\u2019m not a cry baby at all, but like I\u2019ll cry at ads now. RSPCA ads, they get me anyway. And now, everything having to do with children, I mean, I\u2019m a mess.\n\n\u201cI cry every year at it, so there\u2019ll maybe be a bit more again this year.\u201d\n\nChristine was always very relaxed about whether she was going to become a mother.\n\nBut chatting over coffee in West London as talk turns to the 40-year-old\u2019s life away from the cameras, she admits becoming a mum has turned things upside down and completed her family.\n\nThe TV host and wife of Chelsea manager Frank was already a loving stepmum to his two other daughters Luna, 14, and Isla, 12, but now she really has her hands full.\n\nSpeaking about how new addition Patricia has changed her life, she says: \u201cWe were already really happy but I suppose it does complete things. I mean, goodness me, I still look at her now, a year old, and I honestly can\u2019t quite believe she\u2019s mine.\n\n\"And now that she\u2019s developing into being a little toddler, she is not a baby any more. She is sort of saying Mummy and Daddy a bit. And she\u2019s pointing at what she wants. And suddenly you think \u2018She\u2019s getting life now. She\u2019s understanding things.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd other times you think, \u2018Oh gosh. Well what did we do before her?\u2019 Or \u2018What did I do with my time beforehand?\u2019 I actually don\u2019t know, because now I am utterly consumed by her.\u201d\n\nPride Of Britain is also a very important event for her as she and Frank first met at the Daily Mirror awards a decade ago, getting together weeks later and then marrying in 2015.\n\n\u201cGoing to Pride of Britain does have a nice feeling for us,\u201d she says looking back.\n\n\u201cIt was a complete sliding doors moment, I still remember the first meeting as clear as day. Who goes to an awards ceremony and finds a husband? That was me!\n\n\u201cNeither of us were even meant to go and I was late after hosting The One Show. So when we are there now we do have a celebratory glass of champagne. It\u2019s a special evening for us.\u201d\n\nHaving spent time with the couple over the years, it is clear Christine and Frank, 41, bond over a shared sense of humour and work hard but also enjoy family time to themselves.\n\nThey swerved a big first birthday bash for Patricia, known as Patsy in the family, in favour a small gathering at home and a tea party.\n\nI am shown cute pics of Patsy in a birthday hat.\n\nPatsy certainly won\u2019t ever feel lonely growing up - Luna and Isla are already being protective older sisters, Christine says.\n\nSo how is Frank juggling being Chelsea manager and father to a baby?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary job\u201d says Christine. \u201cThere is much more to it, I think, than anyone realises. But he\u2019s very, very much thrown himself into it.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he has changed loads of nappies. But he has stepped in and she adores him. The second Daddy walks in the door, her eyes just light up. She\u2019s getting a curl in her hair like me but she looks more like a mini Frank.\u201d\n\nChristine says the key to her relationship with Frank is \u201cunderstanding and patience\u201d.\n\nShe went on: \"In terms of jobs, I understand, hopefully, what comes with his and he gets mine. More than anything, we have a good laugh.\n\n\u201cWe still think it\u2019s really important to try and get a night where it\u2019s just him and me going out for a bit. I\u2019m not talking fancy stuff, just a pizza or a drink, it never is fancy stuff for us. It is just basic, simple things. We actually have a conversation and I think that\u2019s really important.\u201d\n\nFrank\u2019s football career after Chelsea took him away from West London for a few years but Christine embraced the travel.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been to Manchester, New York, Derby, back and forth to Belfast to see my family. So yeah, it\u2019s been a lovely, lovely decade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you don\u2019t remember anything before it really.\u201d\n\nAnd while life is so good, Christine also thinks becoming a mum has made her think of her own mortality more.\n\nShe says: \u201cYou suddenly start thinking, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to look after myself a bit better for you, not for me.\u2019 It\u2019s a weird thing. You start thinking, \u2018I want to be here for as long as I can\u2019. I want to make sure that she\u2019ll always be okay.\u201d\n\nThe Pride of Britain Awards, Tuesday November 5 at 8pm on ITV.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
