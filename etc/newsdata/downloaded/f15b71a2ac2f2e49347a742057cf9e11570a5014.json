ETH price could rise positively if there is a successful break above the $185 resistance.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nThis past week, there was a sharp downside correction in Ethereum from the $198 high against the US Dollar. The price broke a couple of important supports near the $188 and $185 levels. Moreover, there was a close below the $185 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, the price traded below the $180 level and found support near the $178 level.\n\nIn the weekly forecast, as discussed the importance of the $175 support. The price is currently consolidating above the $178 and $175 support levels. At the moment, it is trading near the $183 level, plus the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $198 high to $178 swing low. However, the upward move is currently facing hurdles near the $184 and $185 levels.\n\nMoreover, the 100 hourly SMA is also preventing an upside break above the $184 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $184 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Therefore, a clear break above the trend line, $185, and the 100 hourly SMA is needed for a strong recovery. The next key resistance is near the $188 level. It represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the last major decline from the $198 high to $178 swing low.\n\nConversely, if there is no upside break above the $185 resistance, there could be another decline. An immediate support is near the $178 level. However, the main support is near the $175 level, below which there is a risk of a downside extension towards the $165 support area.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly consolidating above the $178 and $175 support levels. There are high chances of an upside break above $185, but it\u2019s hard to discard another drop before a fresh increase.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is slowly moving into the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is currently rising and it is just above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $178\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $185", "description": "Ethereum price is setting up for the next move versus the US Dollar and bitcoin.
