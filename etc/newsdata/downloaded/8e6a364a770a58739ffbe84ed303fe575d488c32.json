The campaign is currently discussing plans to deploy Buttigieg\u2019s team of former ambassadors to woo influential undecided Democrats to his team, according to multiple people with knowledge of those discussions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nButtigieg\u2019s diplomatic support extends to the rank and file, as well: Employees of the State Department and agencies within it, along with their spouses, have given more money to Buttigieg\u2019s campaign (over $62,000) than to any other Democrat running for president in 2020, according to analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe diplomatic support is part of a balancing act for Buttigieg, who is running as a candidate of generational change with big ideas but a relatively thin political r\u00e9sum\u00e9. As he ramps up his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, the ambassadorial support balances Buttigieg\u2019s youth with experience, giving him a stamp of approval from experienced and credentialed party insiders.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s young, untested, mayor of a smallish town,\u201d said Erin Pelton, a former foreign service officer and director of communications for multiple Obama-era ambassadors to the United Nations. \u201cSo to surround yourself with the diplomatic equivalent of generals is a good way to show that you\u2019re serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a time when [State Department] morale is low, his youth and freshness in the national political scene are pluses,\u201d said retired State Department veteran Laura Kennedy, a career foreign service officer who served as ambassador to Turkmenistan in the George W. Bush administration. She also said Buttigieg being the first LGBT presidential candidate would likely appeal to State Department employees. \u201cAs a group which as a bureaucratic culture is dedicated to upholding values such as human rights, his status as am LGBT candidate might \u2026 [be] a badge of a crusader, someone who has the courage of his convictions.\u201d\n\nMost Americans couldn\u2019t pick a single U.S. ambassador out of a lineup, and the ambassadors backing Buttigieg readily admit their support won\u2019t be game-changing endorsements to voters picking a presidential candidate. But their political and policy experience can be helpful to a campaign, especially an upstart one \u2014 and many of them have deep connections in Democratic politics, often as big money fundraisers.\n\n\u201cMost of the ambassadors got to be ambassadors because they were deeply involved in Obama\u2019s campaign. So A, they know how to raise money, and B, they know the grassroots politics,\u201d said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), a Buttigieg supporter and former ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein. \u201cWe\u2019re not famous enough or important enough to build big events around. But you can build little events that say, \u2018the former ambassador to Austria is going to kick off the door-knocking.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the coming weeks, former ambassadors Bill Eacho, Tod Sedgwick and Robert Holleyman will all co-headline fundraisers for Buttigieg, according to invitations obtained by POLITICO.\n\nThe former diplomats have also helped connect staff members to the Buttigieg campaign.\n\n\u201cIt could be a former ambassador with a great relationship with a former staffer to tell them to work for this campaign. What it is is historical relationships,\u201d said Rufus Gifford, Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 finance director and a former ambassador to Denmark, who has made maximum donations to Buttigieg and a few other candidates.\n\nOn the Buttigieg campaign, former ambassadors supporting him have advised on both domestic and foreign policy. Beyer helped contribute to Buttigieg\u2019s mental health platform. Others have been involved in the 300-person foreign policy working group that have helped shape Buttigieg\u2019s foreign policy platform \u2014 an early priority for the South Bend mayor.\n\nThey have kept in touch with the campaign through Doug Wilson, the former assistant secretary of Defense for public affairs in the Obama administration, as well as other senior Buttigieg campaign officials in charge of policymaking for the campaign.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

He has quite a kitchen cabinet of national security stars.\u201d\n\nEarly in Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, John Phillips, a former ambassador to Italy, and a small set of former ambassadors held a fundraiser for the South Bend mayor. That group was impressed enough with Buttigieg to connect him with more donors and former ambassadors, merging their personal networks with Buttigieg\u2019s growing campaign.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of peoples\u2019 view about Buttigieg, among ambassadors, is very very impressed with him and his voice ought to be heard,\u201d Phillips recalled. \u201cSo we called our friends who are ambassadors to be co-sponsors and that\u2019s how we got, I think six or seven or eight [ambassadors] on the first fundraiser.\u201d\n\nPhillips added, though, that ambassadors supporting various candidates in the 2020 primary field are often not wedded to just one candidate. Former Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also has significant support from former Obama administration ambassadors.\n\n\u201cA number of the ambassadors are supporting several candidates initially during this primary phase, it\u2019s not necessarily just one person because we have so many that are running,\u201d Phillips said, noting he\u2019s supporting former Vice President Joe Biden as well as Buttigieg and \u201cmaybe Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nBut for Buttigieg, the ambassadors\u2019 support is more important because of his comparatively thin r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s interesting here is that people are gravitating to his campaign given that you have Joe Biden, with whom many people in the national security establishment have worked, and he\u2019s a known commodity. But you do see this other, up-and-coming candidate who has gotten a lot of interest,\u201d said Pelton. \u201cBecause the national security establishment seems interested in him, it\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019ve tried to capitalize on that as a way to buck up his bona fides.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The young mayor has nearly two dozen former ambassadors lending heft to his campaign and mining their elite networks for new supporters.", "authors": ["Daniel Strauss", "Jacqueline Feldscher"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/af/cc/f255e08540ce8ed08a5bc9d077da/1996-pete-buttigieg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
