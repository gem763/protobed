The company says these changes are part of its focus on accessibility, but the text legibility improvements will probably be appreciated by just about everyone who subscribes to the service.\n\nThe shift to colorful gradient backgrounds was made as part of Hulu\u2019s big visual redesign in 2017, and the company also added a translucency effect to non-highlighted words and icons on-screen. Now, Hulu is dialing some of that back in the name of usability. You can see the difference between the old and new main menus above. Franky, I\u2019m not sure what took this long, but the improved legibility makes a big difference.\n\nHulu also says it has built better screen reader capabilities into the app. The screen reader, which vocally guides people through Hulu\u2019s UX, can be enabled through your device\u2019s settings.\n\n\u201cWe made accessible design the main focus of our summer hackathon and launched an audio description hub on our web platform earlier this year,\u201d Hulu\u2019s Akshatha Kommalapati and Tanya Parker wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe audio description hub allows viewers to find content with audio descriptions quickly and easily. And the changes don\u2019t stop there.\u201d\n\nAs for the improvements it\u2019s making today, Hulu says Roku users will see them immediately, and they\u2019ll continue rolling out to Android, iOS, iPadOS, and more living room devices over the next few weeks.", "description": "Hulu is redesigning its menus with easier-to-read text and less translucency.
