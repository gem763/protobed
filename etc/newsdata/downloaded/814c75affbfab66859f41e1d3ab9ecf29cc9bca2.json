Ryan Stuart\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of managers and partners at those places, so you kind of learn at a young age what you think is good management \u2013 who inspires you, and who you kind of hate,\u201d she says.\n\nSo, what makes someone a bad leader? Anyone too quick to blame juniors when things go wrong, the Young Rich Lister says.\n\nSince establishing Showpo in 2010, Lu has learnt that when \u201csomeone screws up\u201d, leaders should take a deep breath and first ask themselves, \u201cDid we give them the wrong instructions? Did we hire the wrong person? Did we trust them too openly without validating their skills first?\u201d\n\nLu, 33, likes to encourage a workplace culture where mistakes can not only be made, they can be laughed about. So at the all-staff meetings on Friday afternoons, anyone who has made a silly mistake that week has to down a \u201cshame shot\u201d (the alcohol component is optional).\n\n\u201cI wanted to email Melanie [Perkins] at Canva and ask her for some onboarding tips for our new HR manager,\u201d Lu says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018she hasn\u2019t replied in a week!\u2019 And then I realised I had emailed Melanie at Showpo who doesn\u2019t work with us any more.\n\n\u201cOur HR manager was like, \u2018Oooh, I\u2019m screenshotting that for shame shot\u2019. It\u2019s just like, dumb things. It\u2019s the best.
