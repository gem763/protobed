And we are ignoring Russia\u2019s efforts to leverage its increasingly dominant position in Syria to amass power and influence throughout the Middle East and beyond,\" he added.\n\nMcConnell specifically pointed to reports of Russians filming themselves at abandoned U.S. bases within Syria calling it a \"strategic calamity neatly captured in one Facebook post.\"\n\nTrump's decision to pull back U.S. troops, paving the way for Turkey's invasion, has sparked a fierce backlash from traditional GOP allies on Capitol Hill, who called it \"catastrophic,\" a \"grave mistake\" and a \"disaster in the making.\"\n\nMcConnell has repeatedly raised red flags about Trump's decision. He told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday that he had told Trump privately, as well as publicly, that he disagreed with the decision.\n\n\u201cI don't know how many times I need to say it and I think I'm speaking for most members of my conference that this was a mistake, and I hope it can be repaired,\u201d McConnell said at the time.\n\nSenate Majority Leader(R-Ky.) on Friday ripped's decision to pull back troops from northern Syria, urging the administration to reverse course.\"Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake. It will leave the American people and homeland less safe, embolden our enemies, and weaken important alliances. Sadly, the recently announced pullout risks repeating the Obama administration\u2019s reckless withdrawal from Iraq,\" McConnell wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.Trump has defended his decision, saying it is \"time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars.\"", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Friday ripped President Trump's decision to pull back troops from northern Syria, urging the administration to reverse course.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mcconnellmitch_101619gn6_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
