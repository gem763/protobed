(Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg News)\n\nSaudi Arabia has restored half of the crude production that was lost to devastating attacks on its oil industry, and the kingdom said output will be fully restored by the end of this month.\n\nThe details came during a news conference Tuesday afternoon in Jiddah by Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman.\n\nSaudi Aramco\u2019s critical Abqaiq processing plant has restored 2 million barrels day that was lost due to the wave of drone and missile attacks on the Saudi oil fields, bin Salman said. The energy minister said production will reach 11 million barrels per day by the end of September.\n\n\u201cThe oil market has gone from pricing in the worst-case scenario, in terms of lost Saudi oil supplies, to one of the best-case scenarios, considering the scope and scale of the attack,\u201d said analyst John Kilduff of Again Capital.\n\nThe kingdom will be producing back at the quota set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its oil partner Russia, by the end of the month. It will restore its full capacity of 12 million barrels per day by the end of the October, the energy minister said.\n\nStock markets bounced back a bit from their Monday declines as investors await an expected interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up on Tuesday, one day after it fell on concerns that a protracted loss of Saudi oil production could harm the global economy. The Dow closed at 27,109, up 32 points from where it started the day. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index finished on the day positive at 3,005, a slight gain of 0.26 percent. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.40 percent at 8,186.\n\nReal estate, utilities and consumer staples, all havens for stock investors concerned about volatility, were the best performers in the S&P stock market sectors. Energy was the worst-performing sector. Shares of international oil companies \u2014 known as the supermajors \u2014 were mixed. BP, ExxonMobil and Chevron closed lower Tuesday. France\u2019s Total SA and Netherlands-headquartered Royal Dutch Shell showed small advances. Companies that service and supply the supermajors also declined; Halliburton and Schlumberger Limited saw shares drop on the news of Aramco\u2019s quick recovery.\n\nShares in transportation companies that rely heavily on fuel gained on the lower oil prices. American, Delta and United Airlines all were up, as was cruise line Carnival Corp.\n\nCrude prices abruptly fell nearly 6 percent Tuesday prior to the news conference on reports that indicated Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s swing oil supplier, would recover from the attack sooner than expected.\n\nWeekend drone strikes took out an oil processing plant and nearby oil field operated by state-owned Aramco, forcing the company to cut its output in half. That took 5.7 million barrels of crude out of daily circulation, or nearly 6 percent of worldwide consumption. Analysts said a quick resolution was crucial to ensuring against disruptions in the supply chain and a corresponding jump in fuel prices.\n\nOn Tuesday, Reuters reported that the world\u2019s second-largest oil producer would resume normal production within two to three weeks. The report, citing top Saudi sources who\u2019ve been briefed on the matter, said Aramco already had restored nearly 70 percent of its lost oil production.\n\nAramco churned out 9.85 million barrels per day in August, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The kingdom has the capacity to pump as much as 12 million barrels per day, making it the only nation in the world with that kind of elasticity.\n\nBrent crude oil, petroleum\u2019s international benchmark, was trading near $64 a barrel, down 7 percent, as of 4p.m. Tuesday. Brent had spiked nearly 20 percent, to $72 per barrel, in the wake of the attacks. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, was selling for $59 on the futures market, down 6 percent from Monday\u2019s close.\n\nThe price swings illustrate the fragility of the world\u2019s oil delivery system. The global energy market is a complex balance that delivers 100 million barrels a day from a constellation of producers to consumers in virtually every corner of the planet. Any sudden shift in the equilibrium can send oil prices spiraling up or down.\n\n\u201cEven before last week\u2019s attack in Saudi Arabia, it has been abundantly clear that the global supply is vulnerable to geopolitical disruption,\u201d said analyst Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. \u201cWe have seen this during the Arab Spring with frequent disruptions in places like Libya. We have seen it for decades with rebel violence in Nigeria. And more recently, we have seen a production meltdown in Venezuela, which is happening for internal political reasons.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether news of Aramco\u2019s recovery timeline will stop the release of crude oil from the United States\u2019 Strategic Petroleum Reserve. On Sunday, President Trump announced via Twitter that he had authorized the release of a yet-unspecified amount of crude oil from the 600-million-barrel reserve to \u201ckeep the markets well-supplied.\u201d It takes 13 days for SPR oil to hit markets after a presidential decision.\n\nExperts had estimated that a protracted oil shortfall from Saudi Arabia could translate into higher pump prices, from 10 to 25 cents a gallon, depending on how long Aramco took to get its production back on track. The average gas price Tuesday in the United States was $2.59 per gallon, down 25 cents from a year ago.", "description": "The kingdom says it has recovered 50 percent of its lost crude output and that it will be fully operational by the end of September.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "Thomas Heath", "Local Business Reporter", "Columnist", "Writing About Entrepreneurs", "Companies In The Washington Metropolitan Area", "September At Pm", "Taylor Telford Is A Reporter Covering National"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vffMN6Yv-6iNn-FWX2DCqy3sr8g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4QUNJIGZKQI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
