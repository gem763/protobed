It\u2019s a dangerous mistake.", "language": "en", "text": "If ever there were a moment for dialogue about how to avoid miscalculation with doomsday weapons, it\u2019s now. This should begin with a bipartisan group of House and Senate leaders \u2014 who can talk with administration officials about strategic stability and prepare the way for eventual discussions between the United States and Russia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHolding our breath on Russia because we\u2019re so angry about its interference in the 2016 election is not a sensible strategy. Neither is our current endless partisan bickering about major issues, which for Moscow is a dream come true.\n\nTrump\u2019s possible withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty was blasted on Monday as \u201creckless\u201d by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The treaty has its flaws, but, as Engel noted, it provides \u201cimportant military transparency,\u201d and withdrawal now \u201cwould further undermine America\u2019s reliability as a stable and predictable partner when it comes to European security.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Open Skies issue, in truth, illustrates why we need renewed dialogue with Russia to update old pacts to fit new technology. The agreement, which took effect in 2002, grew out of a 1955 proposal by President Dwight D. Eisenhower for mutual surveillance flights to calm fears about sneak attacks. It provides for regular reconnaissance overflights by the 34 ratifiers, with the imagery shared later with those nations.\n\nThe value of the agreement isn\u2019t the surveillance photos: The United States and Russia can both get better imagery from their spy satellites. Rather, it\u2019s the value of shared rules for military transparency. Rather than scrapping the agreement, the United States should be talking with Russia about how to modernize it.\n\nThe problem is that relations between Washington and Moscow are frozen, partly because of the partisan paralysis that surrounds Trump\u2019s presidency. As Nunn and Moniz write: \u201cThe United States and Russia are now in a state of strategic instability; an accident or mishap could set off a cataclysm.\u201d Just because Trump favors more dialogue with Russia is not a reason for Democrats to oppose it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsider how the arms-control structure has gradually crumbled: The United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002; last year, Trump announced that he would quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; GOP senators have also urged Trump to leave the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And now, the move to close Open Skies.\n\nThe last pillar of the old regime is the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). It will expire in 2021 unless it is renewed. This should be a no-brainer. It caps the number of nuclear warheads and provides important verification measures. But unless the two nations resume strategic dialogue, this, too, will slip away.\n\nAnd then there are some terrifying new problems, which weren\u2019t anticipated back in the heyday of arms control. Rules of war don\u2019t exist for cyberspace. As Nunn and Moniz note, cyberattacks could disable early-warning systems, leaving nations blind to a missile attack, or disrupt command-and-control systems that could retaliate. And then there are space weapons, which could destroy military and surveillance satellites.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRussia has been a primary culprit in the unraveling process. Vladimir Putin\u2019s revenge play for the loss of the Soviet Union has meant pushing back on every front, including Open Skies and other arms-control pacts. The United States shouldn\u2019t reward his belligerence, but it shouldn\u2019t ignore major strategic issues with Russia, either.\n\nThe final obvious reason the United States needs to think more about arms control is that we have a careening, out-of-control president who, let\u2019s never forget, commands the codes that could launch nuclear weapons. As the impeachment debate heats up, the United States will need a steadying process of quiet, high-level discussion about issues that are, in the end, a matter of life or death for us all.\n\nTwitter: @IgnatiusPost\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "If ever there were a moment for dialogue about how to avoid miscalculation with doomsday weapons, it\u2019s now.", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Columnist Covering Foreign Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZBtE3DOz3JIs5N1nJZRuA5Hr2ic=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BTNBCQAXQQI6TCATZOO6Y5Q6OM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
