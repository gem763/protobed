Such as the Death Star Turbo S E-Hybrid Sport Turismo. Or the TIE Fighter Carrera 4 S Targa, once a Jedi undoubtedly blows the roof off it.\n\nWe jest, because we haven\u2019t yet seen it. No, the announcement is simply that Porsche and Lucasfilm \u2013 the people who make all the many Star Wars movies \u2013 will collaborate on a starship design to support this year\u2019s likely biggest film, The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nPorsche\u2019s design bod Michael Mauer said: \u201cEven though they do not seem to share many elements at first glance, both worlds have a similar design philosophy.\u201d Clearly, the rebel alliance also enjoys optioning carbon fibre cupholders on their attack cruisers. See? There\u2019s too much fun to be had here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that both sides can draw major benefits from this exchange,\u201d he added. Indeed, Lucasfilm\u2019s Doug Chiang said: \u201cWe are bringing together two worlds with this project, the exotic film design of a galaxy far, far away and the precision work that goes into developing emotive Porsche sports cars\u201d. Rumours that the Millennium Falcon will indeed feature a tri-electric-motor setup with a range of 300-miles (on the WLTP cycle) are completely made up. By us. Just now.\n\nWe\u2019re told the finished design will be presented at The Rise of Skywalker premiere in December, alongside the more earthly-bound Taycan. May the 964 be with you!", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_1280w/public/images/news-article/2019/10/e59b54909121f63e419345d56441513a/starwarsporsche.jpg?itok=Mll0KJrK", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
