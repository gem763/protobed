We have given ourselves a big, big uphill task to get in the top four, never mind the top six.\n\n\u201cWe need to get a run together and get the confidence back. If you only walk on sunny days you will never get to your destination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, but we know where we want to get to.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer said he would try and \u201cevaluate\u201d the opening eight Premier League games, from which United have only nine points in their worst start to a league campaign since 1989-90, during the international break.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed, of course,\u201d the Norwegian said. \u201cThe boys worked their socks off. But we don\u2019t create enough chances to win a game of football.\u201d\n\nGoalkeeper David de Gea said it was the worst moment for the club since he joined in 2011.\n\nAsked what was missing, the Spaniard said: \u201cEverything. There is lots to improve. We just try to keep trying and fighting, improving every day. It\u2019s a hard moment for us.\u201d\n\nFormer United defender Gary Neville, analysing the game for Sky Sports, said this could be a season of pain for the club.\n\n\u201cUnited will have a lot of painful moments this season and we will have a lot of inquests. There is no quick fix,\u201d he said.\n\nNewcastle moved out of the bottom three and are only a point behind United. Manager Steve Bruce, a former Man Utd league winner, had never won as a manager against his old club but did so at the 23rd time of asking.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve waited something like 20 years for a result against Man Utd. I\u2019m delighted for everybody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI hope this is the turning point. I know I\u2019m not going to be everyone\u2019s cup of tea but the nonsense that flies around is insulting. Hopefully this helps the cause.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s next game is at home against Liverpool who have a 100% record after eight games and lead the table by eight points. \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect game for us,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cThe international break is also at the perfect time because their heads need a bit of airing.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United face a \"big, big uphill task\" to finish in the Premier League's top six, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said on Sunday after his lacklustre side lost 1-0 at Newcastle United.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437805062&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950KQ", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
