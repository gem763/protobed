GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia shares at 6-week high on trade progress, ECB easing\n\n* MSCI Asia ex-Japan up 0.5%, highest since Aug 1\n\n* Europe set for higher open; ECB easing encourages markets\n\n* Trump wants full deal with Beijing after goodwill gestures\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano and Noah Sin\n\nTOKYO/HONG KONG, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Asian stocks climbed to\n\ntheir highest in six weeks on Friday, as signs of progress in\n\nU.S.-China trade talks and aggressive stimulus from the European\n\nCentral Bank helped to calm fears of a global economic slowdown.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nedged up 0.5% to their highest since Aug. 1,\n\nwhile Japan's Nikkei rose more than 1.0% to four-month\n\nhighs. Markets in mainland China and South Korea were closed for\n\npublic holidays.\n\nEuropean stocks are set to track Asia's firmer tone, with\n\npan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.1%, Germany's DAX\n\nfutures up 0.1% and London's FTSE futures\n\nhigher by 0.2%.\n\n\"Risk assets should find further support from accommodative\n\npolicies, which are set to remain in vogue for some time, and\n\nnot just in Europe as seen in the global easing trend,\" said\n\nEsty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis in Geneva,\n\nSwitzerland.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we believe that trade uncertainty and growth\n\nconcerns will not vanish, so any reprieve on either subject will\n\nbe welcome. We also believe that some earnings growth will be\n\nneeded for equities to grind higher,\" she said.\n\nThe United States on Thursday welcomed China's renewed\n\npurchases of U.S. farm goods while maintaining the threat of\n\nU.S. tariff hikes as the world's two largest economies prepared\n\nfor talks aimed at breaking their trade war impasse.\n\nTrump said he preferred a comprehensive trade deal with\n\nChina but did not rule out the possibility of an interim pact,\n\neven as he said an \"easy\" agreement would not be\n\npossible. Investors bet optimism will prevail in the near future\n\nthough most economists in a Reuters poll believed the trade\n\ndispute will worsen or at best stay the same over the coming\n\nyear. The U.S. S&P 500 closed within striking distance of its\n\nall-time closing high, rising 0.29% to 3,009.57, near a record\n\nclosing high of 3,024.50 marked in late July. .N\n\nThe Philadelphia semiconductor share index hit an\n\nall-time high while MSCI ACWI also came near\n\nthis year's peak after seven straight days of gains by Thursday.\n\nSentiment found modest support from Trump's planned tax\n\noverhaul aimed at middle-income households next\n\nyear.\n\nCENTRAL BANKS\n\nOn Thursday, the European Central Bank delivered\n\nbigger-than-expected stimulus, cutting interest rates by 0.10\n\npercentage point to minus 0.50%, promising that rates would stay\n\nlow for longer and restarting bond purchases of 20 billion euros\n\na month from November. The resumption of quantitative easing had been seen as a\n\nclose call and helped to boost risk assets.\n\nBut the euro quickly lost steam and European bond yields\n\nalso rose as profit-taking set in.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi stepped up his rhetoric in\n\ncalling for governments to spend their way out of a slowdown,\n\nhighlighting the limitations of monetary policy and also fanning\n\nexpectations of fiscal spending down the road.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.1085 near the two-week high hit\n\nin U.S. trade, having risen 0.5 percent on Thursday.\n\nRising risk appetite kept the yen near its six-week low of\n\n108 to the dollar .\n\nTen-year German Bund yields also rose back to minus 0.503%\n\n.\n\nThat also helped keep the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries\n\nat 1.7838% , near early August levels, breached in\n\nThursday's session.\n\nFed funds rate futures FEDWATCH imply a 0.25 percentage\n\npoint interest rate cut by the Fed next week but have\n\neffectively priced out any chance of a larger cut.\n\nThe Fed will announce its policy on Wednesday, followed by\n\nthe Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Thursday.\n\nSources told Reuters the BOJ is leaning towards standing pat\n\nnext week if markets are calm, but is brainstorming ways to\n\ndeepen negative interest rates at minimal cost. \"I think a rally in stock prices will run out of steam soon.\n\nIt's typical buy-on-rumour-sell-on-fact trade on central bank\n\nstimulus and will be over by the Fed and the BOJ's meetings,\"\n\nsaid Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset\n\nManagement.\n\n\"People also seem to think there will be a deal between\n\nChina and the States soon but you never know when suddenly Trump\n\n(does an) about-face. We just saw that in May and August,\" he\n\nadded.\n\nTrump unveiled a hike in tariffs on $200 billion worth of\n\nChinese imports in early May and announced another 10% tariff on\n\nthe remaining $300 billion imports from China in early August.\n\nU.S. stock prices were at record levels on both occasions.\n\nOil prices were on course to post weekly losses, on\n\ncontinued worries about weakening demand and on speculation\n\nTrump may ease sanctions on Iran after his former national\n\nsecurity adviser John Bolton, an Iran hawk, left the White House\n\nearlier this week.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 0.25% to $60.21 a barrel\n\nwhile U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down\n\n0.2% at $54.98.\n\nECB, German bunds Sept 13 https://tmsnrt.rs/2ZZJE1i\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Editing by Sam Holmes and Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia shares at 6-week high on trade progress, ECB easing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE020QH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
