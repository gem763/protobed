Tensions flared in the crowd of about 200 people which was composed mostly of counterprotesters and peppered with far left groups like Antifa. The controversial parade garnered national attention since its inception in June. \u201cWe\u2019re covered in black so when we attack these guys we can\u2019t be prosecuted,\u201d said Jon Crowley, an Antifa member who told the Herald that he felt violence was the only way to deal with the people marching in the parade, which went from Copley Square to City Hall Plaza. \u201cThey are fascists, 100%. How else are you going to get them to shut up?\u201d\n\nThat quote really sums up Antifa in a nutshell. Why would a lawmaker want to support people looking to commit politically-motivated violence?

As Jazz put it, this looks like an intentional effort to seek confrontation. But the police were there doing their jobs, trying to keep the groups apart so no one got hurt. They didn\u2019t deserve to be attacked for that. Raising money for a group that comes to these events to get violent seems like an unusual angle for a lawmaker to take, but it\u2019s not really surprising that AOC is siding with Antifa over the police.", "description": "\"We\u2019re covered in black so when we attack these guys we can\u2019t be prosecuted\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AOC.jpg"}
