Trump on Thursday also called on China to initiate the same probe. The whistleblower complaint that triggered the inquiry alleges that senior White House officials attempted to \u201clock down\u201d records of the phone call to keep it hidden.\n\nIn light of that information, the lawsuit\u2019s lawyers requested a temporary restraining order.
