Consider it an advent calendar for globetrotters. Today: Machu Picchu. Previous articles have looked at whale watching, the Northern Lights and the Taj Mahal.\n\nHalf a million visitors per year can\u2019t be wrong: Machu Picchu, Peru\u2019s most famous, most photogenic, most fabled Inca citadel is a wonder to behold.

For sure, Peru\u2019s most popular archaeological site belongs to that exclusive club of genuine global icons, standing alongside the likes of Angkor Wat, the Pyramids of Giza and the Taj Mahal as a symbol of past majesty and enduring beauty.", "description": "Our series helps you plan for travel's greatest adventures.
