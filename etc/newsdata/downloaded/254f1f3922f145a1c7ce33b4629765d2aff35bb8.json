He attacked 34 women.\n\nThe 29-year-old man would lure his victims to the Westville and New Germany areas with the promise of work, News24 previously reported.\n\n\"His modus operandi was that he would tell the women that his employer was looking for a domestic helper and convince them to take a taxi with him. They would get off the taxi on the M19 Highway near Westville where he would threaten them with a knife and proceed to tie them up, rape and rob them. The accused would flee the scene, leaving them bound,\" Kara said.\n\nHe stole their money, cellphones, and bankcards and in one instance, he even stole the victim's shoes.\n\nMost of his victims were raped along secluded areas of the M19 highway in the western part of the city.\n\nRead: Durban 'highway rapist': Anger as sentencing is postponed\n\nHis reign of terror came to an end on Valentine's Day when he was arrested in New Germany at his place of work following another rape incident, involving a 25-year-old victim, along the same highway on January 18. The victim, who was robbed, raped and left tied up, was assisted by community members following the attack.\n\n\"In aggravation of sentence, State advocate Alex Khanyile handed in victim impact statements compiled by some of the complainants and facilitated by court preparation officer Bonisile Mngoma. The common sentiment through all these statements was the horror they experienced at the hands of the accused,\" Kara said.\n\nThe Acting Director of Public Prosecutions in Kwa-Zulu Natal Advocate Elaine Zungu adds: \"The sentence and conviction in this matter is indicative that justice has been served. While employment is difficult to obtain, we appeal to the community to be wary of job offers and prospects as matters of this nature are becoming prevalent.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
