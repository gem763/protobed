Her husband, rapper and Law & Order: SVU cast member Ice-T, however, has her back.\n\nSpeaking to TMZ, the 61-year-old star defended his wife from mom-shamers who claimed that 3-year-old Chanel was \u201ctoo big for breastfeeding.\u201d The criticism \u2014 and a fair amount of praise from fellow pro-nursing moms \u2014 came after Austin recently shared photos of her breastfeeding the toddler during a flight. The little girl \u201cstill wants the boob,\u201d the model told her fans.\n\nAccording to Austin\u2019s post, nursing is \u201cmore of a comfort thing\u201d for Chanel, who eats solids and only feeds before naps and at night. Ice-T echoed that sentiment in his TMZ interview.\n\n\u201c[Critics] make it like the baby only eats, breastfeeds,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery once in a while, you know what I\u2019m saying, she wants to get close to her mom, so that\u2019s what they do. She eats food. She eats f***ing cheeseburgers.\u201d\n\nDespite the criticism from some commenters, Leigh Anne O\u2019Connor, a board-certified lactation consultant and La Leche League leader, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that Chanel is \u201clucky to have her parents following their instincts.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor says it\u2019s \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d to breastfeed a toddler, whether for nourishment or comfort, but claims that \u201cWestern culture, and particularly the U.S., is very judgmental when it comes to breastfeeding in general, let alone the biological norm.\n\n\u201cLabeling a toddler \u2018too old\u2019 is an unfortunate symptom of our current culture,\u201d she adds.\n\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, \u201cexclusive breastfeeding is recommended up to 6 months of age, with continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to 2 years of age or beyond.\u201d But as O\u2019Connor notes, attitudes in the U.S. appear to be more conservative about prolonged nursing.\n\nBy contrast, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) put it this way in its reccomendation: \u201cExclusive breastfeeding for about the first six months of a baby's life, followed by breastfeeding in combination with the introduction of complementary foods until at least 12 months of age, and continuation of breastfeeding for as long as mutually desired by mother and baby.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Ice-T defended his wife from mom-shamers who claimed their 3-year-old daughter was \"too big for breastfeeding.\"", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K62OBN58ORYIlrAQYHg7JQ--~B/aD03MTY7dz0xMTE0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3b8cbe30-e091-11e9-95bd-fb21c8c743c2", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
