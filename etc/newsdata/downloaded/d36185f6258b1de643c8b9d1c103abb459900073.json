Why didn't he do his job? It seems to me there are only two possible reasons.\n\n'Firstly, he might have willingly taken part in the robbery. If that is the case, then he was obviously hopelessly ill-prepared for the British Rail enquiry.\n\n'Once the enquiry was overcome his only remaining hurdle would be to give evidence at the trial where his deceit might be uncovered.'\n\nDespite Mr Satchell's suspicions, there is little evidence of Wyn-De-Bank suddenly becoming rich after the robbery.\n\nHis son, Charlie, said the family received new bikes a few months after the event, but there were few luxuries later on.\n\nDuring the heist a gang stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed through the Buckinghamshire countryside close to Cheddington.\n\nThe train was driven a mile and a half to the bridge where the criminals unloaded \u00a32,631,684 in used notes.\n\nBut they were later captured and 12 were jailed for a total of more than 300 years.\n\nThe getaway cars are parked under the bridge which were used to take minor roads back to Leatherslade Farm\n\nDetectives at Cheddington Station inspect coupling of one of the coaches of the Glasgow-Euston travelling post office\n\nMr Satchwell has also claimed in his book that the notorious Kray twins were linked to the plot.\n\nThe Krays were known for their business dealings in London, but the author says they also spread up to Glasgow too - where the fateful train started its journey.\n\nMr Satchwell said the brothers were in cahoots with Scottish gangster Arthur Thompson from at least 1963 - the year of the robbery - and Ronnie had 'mysterious' flying visits to the city that year.\n\nHe wrote: 'Importantly, Ronnie Kray flew to Glasgow several times in 1963 to meet with Glasgow gangsters.'", "description": "Thomas Wyn-De-Bank was on duty in a British Rail signal box near to where the famous heist happened in the early hours of August 8, 1963, Graham Satchwell reveals in his new book.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19542356-0-image-a-167_1570716460500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
