REUTERS/Stringer\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility for Saturday\u2019s attacks that knocked out more than half of Saudi oil output. But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was no evidence the attacks came from Yemen and accused Iran of \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\nIranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi, speaking on state TV, dismissed the U.S. claim as \u201cpointless\u201d. A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned that the Islamic Republic was ready for \u201cfull-fledged\u201d war and that U.S. military assets were within range of Iranian missiles.\n\n\u201cEverybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\u201d the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps Aerospace Force Amirali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n\nState-run oil company Saudi Aramco said the strikes would cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day, or more than 5% of global crude supply, at a time when Aramco is gearing up for a stock market listing.\n\nAramco gave no timeline for when output would resume but said early Sunday it would give a progress update in around 48 hours. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \u201cweeks, not days\u201d.\n\nThe kingdom, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, ships more than 7 million barrels of oil to global destinations every day, and for years has served as the supplier of last resort to markets.\n\nThe United States said it was ready to tap its emergency oil reserves if needed after the attack on two oil plants, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum processing facility in Abqaiq.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s stock market opened down 2.3% on Sunday. Saudi petrochemical companies, including Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC), announced a significant reduction in feedstock supplies.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq is the nerve center of the Saudi energy system. Even if exports resume in the next 24-48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been altered,\u201d Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters.\n\nSaudi authorities have yet to directly blame any party for Saturday\u2019s pre-dawn strikes, which they said involved drones, but the energy minister linked it to a series of attacks on Saudi oil assets and crude tankers in Gulf waters.\n\nSAUDI READY TO ACT\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was no evidence the attacks came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led military coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between regional rivals Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi\u2019ite Iran.\n\nRiyadh has accused Iran and its proxies of being behind previous attacks claimed by the Houthis on oil pumping stations and Shaybah oilfield, charges Tehran denies.\n\nSome Iraqi media outlets said the attack originated from Iraq, where Iran-backed paramilitary groups have wielded increasing power but Iraq denied this on Sunday and vowed to punish anyone who intended to use Iraq as a launchpad for attacks in the region.\n\nRegional tensions have escalated after Washington quit an international nuclear deal and extended sanctions on Iran to choke off its vital oil exports, a move supported by U.S. Gulf allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe attack comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was possible at the United Nations General Assembly in New York later in September. Tehran ruled out talks until sanctions are lifted.\n\n\u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d Pompeo said in a Twitter post on Saturday.\n\nSaudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Trump by telephone on Saturday that Riyadh was willing and able to deal with the \u201cterrorist aggression\u201d.\n\nTurkey, an ally of Iran, condemned the attack but called for avoiding \u201call sorts of provocative steps\u201d that could damage regional security and stability, the foreign ministry said.\n\nA senior Emirati official said the UAE, Riyadh\u2019s main partner in the Western-backed military coalition in Yemen, would fully support Saudi Arabia as the assault \u201ctargets us all\u201d.\n\nRelated Coverage France condemns attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure\n\nThe UAE, concerned about rising tensions with Iran and Western criticism of the Yemen war, in June scaled down its military presence, leaving Riyadh to try to neutralize the Houthis to prevent Iran from gaining influence along its border.\n\nThe conflict has been in military stalemate for years. The alliance has air supremacy but has come under international scrutiny over civilian deaths and a humanitarian crisis that has seen Yemen pushed to the brink of famine.\n\nThe Houthis, who have proved better at guerrilla warfare, have stepped up missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities, complicating U.N. peace efforts to end the war.
