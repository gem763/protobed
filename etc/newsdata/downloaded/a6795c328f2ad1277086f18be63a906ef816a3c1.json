She\u2019s a legend. She\u2019s going to be in the history books, she\u2019s a former nominee of our party, and she just came out against a sitting U.S. congresswoman, a decorated war veteran, and somebody who\u2019s running for the nomination of our party with a complete smear and no facts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do not want someone of her stature to legitimate these attacks against anybody,\" Jones continued. \"If you\u2019ve got real evidence, come forward with it.
