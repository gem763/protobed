She alleged this included an attempt to forcibly kiss Vester, who was in her 20s at the time.\n\n\"Morning Joe\" co-host Brzezinski was one of more than 60 women who signed a letter supporting Brokaw only two days after Vester first went public with her claims. It irked Vester that high-powered women could blindly defend a powerful man, so she said she couldn\u2019t resist confronting Brzezinski when she had the chance.\n\nIn a text message obtained by Fox News, Brzezinski appeared to apologize to Vester on behalf of Brokaw following a dinner to hash out a heated conversation that had occurred when Vester spied the outspoken MSNBC morning show host while jogging in the New York City suburb where they both lived.\n\n'HARASSMENT STILL GOES UNPUNISHED' AT NBC NEWS EVEN AFTER MATT LAUER DISMISSAL, FORMER CORRESPONDENT ALLEGES\n\n\u201cWe knew each other. I saw her, she said, \u2018Hey,\u2019 and then I slowed down and I said, \u2018So, I just have to ask you, why did you sign that letter?\u2019 And she went off on me in a way that was so shocking,\u201d Vester told Fox News about the exchange that occurred outside the home of Brzezinski and \u201cMorning Joe\u201d namesake Joe Scarborough.\n\nBrzezinski \u201cstarted yelling at me, saying Tom Brokaw is an old man and he probably wouldn\u2019t survive\u201d the allegations, Vester said.\n\nIn response, Brzezinski said Thursday night, \u201cI am saddened that a personal conversation between two working mothers was so twisted out of context, and that my personal text expressing sympathy for Linda\u2019s problems at multiple networks was screenshot and sent to a competitor in an attempt to discredit me. The story is false.\u201d\n\nBrzezinski has fancied herself a champion of women and penned the 2011 book \u201cKnowing Your Value: Women, Money and Getting What You\u2019re Worth.\u201d But, she also has come under fire for criticizing the woman who first accused former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken of sexual misconduct and reportedly tried to help salvage the career of her former colleague, now-disgraced political journalist Mark Halperin.\n\nBrzezinski \"thought I was being a little too cute and that she didn\u2019t believe that I had done enough to fend him off,\u201d Vester said.\n\nLINDA VESTER: MATT LAUER WAS FIRED A YEAR AGO \u2013 NBC NEWS' CULTURE IS COMCAST'S FAILURE\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Mika, you have said that you were a victim of sexual assault, right?\u2019 She said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I said, \u2018Was there a power differential involved in your case?\u2019 She goes, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Vester explained. \u201cI said, \u2018Then I think you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u2019\u201d\n\nVester said Brzezinski then questioned how believable Vester appeared in a video interview with Variety, before Scarborough came out of the house. Scarborough stepped in, according to Vester, to help calm the situation, encouraging them to continue the discussion at a more appropriate time.\n\n\u201cI just kept talking to her and explaining: \u2018Mika, we live a few houses away from each other. Before you signed that letter you could have just walked down the street or emailed me,\u2019\u201d Vester said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember her response, but at that point, Joe Scarborough walked out of the house.\"\n\nBrzezinski allegedly had a change of heart during the impromptu war of words.\n\n\u201cMika settled down, and we talked some more and she finally said, \u2018I believe you, I believe your account,\u2019\u201d Vester said.\n\nTOM BROKAW ACCUSER 'VERY DISAPPOINTED' IN RACHEL MADDOW FOR SUPPORTING NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE DESPITE HARASSMENT CLAIMS\n\n\u201cI was just so taken aback by how she attacked me when I just asked her a question. Immediately after my run, I called my attorney and my husband and gave them a blow-by-blow,\u201d Vester said, adding, \u201cThen she texted me and said, \u2018Let\u2019s have dinner together.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen reached by Fox News, Vester's attorney, Ari Wilkenfeld, confirmed that he had been made aware of the alleged encounter soon after it happened.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to clear the air, Brzezinski is said to have suggested they get together and the cable news power couple eventually went to Vester\u2019s home to break bread.\n\n\u201cWe had a nice dinner together,\u201d Vester said. \u201cWe got along fine over dinner. Totally fine. We talked about other things, [Brokaw] never came up during dinner.\u201d\n\nEX-WEINSTEIN EXECUTIVE CALLS NBC NEWS 'OPPOSITE OF HONEST,' SUPPORTS RONAN FARROW\n\nBrzezinski sent Vester a text message following the meal on July 2, 2018, thanking her for a \u201cdelicious dinner\u201d and alluding to the fact that she believed her claims against Brokaw.\n\n\u201cI loved talking and sharing with you, I am so sorry about what happened to you,\u201d Brzezinski wrote in the text message, obtained by Fox News.\n\nA source close to Brzezinski told Fox News the text was regarding \u201ca deeply private conversation about multiple personal challenges Vester faced, that is now being willfully taken out of context.\u201d\n\nVester said she has not spoken to Brzezinski since that text message.\n\nROBERT DE NIRO\u2019S FOUL-MOUTHED CNN APPEARANCE RAISES EYEBROWS INSIDE NETWORK: \u2018WHAT DID OUR VIEWERS GAIN?\u2019\n\n\u201cShe moved away,\u201d Vester said. \u201cIn the end, I was satisfied when she said she believed my account. I let it go because she came around and said, \u2018I believe you.\u2019\u201d\n\nMSNBC declined comment when reached by Fox News.\n\nNBC News reportedly never conducted a thorough investigation of the misconduct claims; Brokaw remains employed by the network to this day. He appeared on Brzezinski\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d as recently as Sept. 11.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nNBC News declined comment when asked if the letter signed by female employees to support Brokaw directly influenced the decision not to launch a major investigation into Vester\u2019s claims.\n\nBrokaw has strongly denied Vester\u2019s allegations.\n\nVester hesitantly shared this story as Ronan Farrow\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\" is on the verge of thrusting NBC News\u2019 culture issues back into the national spotlight. She appears to have no ill will toward the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host, but simply wants women in power at NBC to make things right. Vester believes that the Peacock Network\u2019s culture won\u2019t change until women like Brzezinski speak out.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI think that Mika, Rachel Maddow, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb should all be using the power that they have as highly paid anchors to push NBC to investigate all of the high-profile alleged harassers who are still walking the halls of the newsroom,\u201d Vester said. \u201cThey make a lot of money and they should use that bully pulpit, that power, to make NBC do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nVester worked at NBC News from 1989 until 1999, when she left and joined Fox News. From 2002 to 2005, she hosted \u201cDayside with Linda Vester,\u201d but left television in 2005 to be a stay-at-home mom to her four children. She has maintained a relationship with Fox News, sometimes appearing as a guest on the network, and penned an opinion piece for FoxNews.com in 2018.\n\nIn response to her initial claim, Brokaw called Vester \u201ca former colleague who left NBC News angry that she had failed in her pursuit of stardom,\u201d and said she \"unleashed a torrent of unsubstantiated criticism and attacks on me more than 20 years after I opened the door for her and a new job at Fox News.\u201d", "description": "When Linda Vester accused NBC News legend Tom Brokaw of sexual misconduct in the spring of 2018, fellow Peacock Network host Mika Brzezinski publicly rushed to his defense \u2014but three months later she privately apologized to Vester after a bizarre series of events, seemingly admitting she believed\u00a0her after all, but never went public with the revelation.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
