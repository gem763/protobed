The first time it happened the sun was in my eyes as I drove west toward Memphis, and a late summer drought was filling the air with dust motes. For a moment I thought I was imagining flowers where flowers had never been before. A daydream on a lonesome stretch of highway as twilight came on.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about the flowers themselves \u2014 they\u2019re the plants that commonly bloom along Nashville\u2019s greenways during late summer \u2014 but these flowers weren\u2019t in a park or a nature preserve. They were growing right on the interstate median and on the side of the road. I figured the state\u2019s Department of Transportation simply hadn\u2019t gotten around to mowing yet.\n\nThen I started to see the flowers in springtime, too, and all summer. The decision not to mow, it turns out, was deliberate. The Tennessee Department of Transportation \u2014 like many other state transportation departments across the country \u2014 now practices swath mowing, a strategy that allows wildflowers to bloom unmolested in rural areas till after the first frost. Instead of clearing the entire space between the road and the right-of-way fence, mowers clear only a 16-foot-wide area next to the road.\n\nThe mowed swath preserves clear sightlines for drivers while allowing wildflowers to grow in the deep margins between the mowed area and the fence. After the wildflowers have gone to seed, and the seeds have had time to ripen and drop, mowers clear the entire area again to keep trees from becoming established too close to the road. In Tennessee, this plan began as an experimental program in 2013 and now encompasses all rural highways managed by the state. That\u2019s 13,807 miles of blooming flowers across Tennessee.", "description": "A new wildflower meadow at a Tennessee welcome center is just one of many efforts to address the loss of pollinator habitat.", "authors": ["Margaret Renkl"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/opinion/04renkl1/merlin_160839273_9b307561-25fa-46ed-b44b-cc6a5e1dcfad-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
