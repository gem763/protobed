It doesn\u2019t mean that the investigation is any less tainted. This is tainted because of the motivation which is a political one to serve the president\u2019s political interests.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/27/2019 20:24:55PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/300/fe33580c-1382-47ba-be69-4a272480e15a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
