Please don't climb.'\n\nA man wearing a 'respect' t-shirt encourages visitors not to climb Uluru on the last day before an official ban comes into place\n\nAboriginal people have been asking that the route be closed for years, as dozens of people have either died or been seriously hurt while making the trek, defiling their sacred site\n\nTourists queue up to climb the rock ahead of sunset, when the trail was shut. An official ban will come into force overnight, meaning the climb will not be opened on Saturday\n\nTourists line up to climb Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in the Northern Territory, Yulara\n\nUluru is central to the cultural traditions and creation myths of the Anangu people. Tourists are only told the stories that children would hear, while some parts of the myth are only revealed to men or women as they come of age\n\nSonita Vinecombe, a visitor from the Australian city of Adelaide who lined up early in the morning to make the trek, said she had mixed feelings on the issue.\n\n'You want to respect the cultural side of things, but still you want to have it as a challenge to get up the rock,' she told Reuters.\n\nAmerican tourist Kathleen Kostroski said she would not climb because it would be 'sacrilegious' to do so.\n\n'It's a violation against mother nature, first of all and secondly, against the aboriginal indigenous people here,' she said.\n\nDozens of people have died while climbing Uluru, from falls and dehydration in the hot, dry conditions. Summer temperatures often top 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe closure was announced two years ago when fewer than 20 percent of visitors were making the climb.\n\nTo commemorate the climbing ban the park will conduct public celebrations over the weekend.\n\nIt was an emotional day, said indigenous ranger Tijiangu Thomas.\n\n'Happiness is the majority feeling, knowing that people are no longer going to be disrespecting the rock and the culture - and being safe.'\n\nThe Oct. 26 closure marks 34 years since the land was given back to the Anangu people, an important moment in the struggle by indigenous groups to retrieve their homelands.", "description": "Hundreds of people rushed to climb Uluru on Friday, the final day that scaling the sacred rock will be allowed before an official ban comes into place following decades of campaigning.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/12/20174898-0-image-a-16_1572003804972.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
