REUTERS/Sertac Kayar/File Photo\n\nAnkara accuses the HDP of links to militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK). It has now replaced a total of 12 mayors from the HDP on alleged links to terrorism since municipal elections in March.\n\nThe mayors in the towns of Kayapinar, Bismil and Kocakoy in the southeastern Diyarbakir province and the mayor of Ercis in the eastern province of Van were suspended and replaced by local administrators, the offices of the two regional governors said.\n\nThree mayors are currently in custody on terrorism charges, the governors\u2019 offices said, while the Diyarbakir prosecutor\u2019s office said the former Bismil mayor had been released under judicial control.\n\nThe HDP said six other of its candidates who won a majority of votes in the March mayoral elections were not given their election certificates because they had previously been dismissed from public office by decree.\n\nIn August, Turkey first removed the mayors of Diyarbakir, Mardin and Van, three metropolitan cities won by the HDP.\n\nSelcuk Mizrakli, who was removed from his office in Diyarbakir, was jailed pending trial on Tuesday, the provincial prosecutor\u2019s office said.\n\nPrior to the March municipal polls, around 100 mayors in towns held by the HDP had been replaced by state officials.\n\nThe former co-leaders of the pro-Kurdish HDP have both been jailed since 2016 on terrorism charges, with several other prominent members accused of supporting terrorism over what the government says are links to the PKK.\n\nThe HDP denies links to the PKK but does not consider it a terrorist organisation.\n\nThe moves against the HDP coincide with a Turkish military offensive in neighbouring Syria against the YPG Kurdish militia, which Ankara also accuses of ties to the PKK. A five-day, U.S.-brokered pause in the offensive was due to expire later on Tuesday.\n\nThe HDP is the only party in the Turkish parliament that opposed Operation Peace Spring in northeast Syria.", "description": "Turkey has replaced four mayors from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) with state officials, the offices of two provincial governors said on Tuesday, part of a widening crackdown on local councils controlled by the party.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443657788&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0MZ", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
