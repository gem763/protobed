But she was also an alcoholic and drug dealer who had suffered years of abuse from her trainers. She is surprised she is still alive, she says\n\nOne day, when she was a teenager, Casey Legler woke up with a hangover, then jumped into a pool and broke the Olympic freestyle swimming record. The year was 1996 and Legler was in Atlanta, a member of the French team, having a practice session as she awaited the Olympic finals the next day. Legler, at 6ft 2in, was built to swim. She had been groomed to be an Olympian from the age of 12. But when the finals came \u2013 the biggest day of her professional life \u2013 she bombed, coming 29th in the women\u2019s 50m freestyle. She spent the next day drunk and dealing cocaine \u2013 to Olympic teammates and teenage members of other international teams.\n\nThat is perhaps the most troubling aspect of Legler\u2019s new memoir, which charts her time as one of the fastest female swimmers in the world. This isn\u2019t just the story of an alcoholic girl who, under the supposedly protective wing of coaches and doctors, was sexually abused and given performance-enhancing drugs. It\u2019s how her experience was not unusual among her female peers. She remembers, for instance, a teenage member of the English Olympic team asking her to buy drugs. Alcohol and drug use, she says, were commonplace among top-level child athletes, not just in celebratory post-competition blow-outs but every night. From the age of 12, \u201cI swam for every chance to get wasted,\u201d she writes.\n\nToday, Legler is 42 and sitting in a London cafe. She is tall, calm and engaging, with a crew cut and tattoos swirling down her arms and up her neck. She spent her early 20s in rehab, before studying architecture at Smith College, Massachusetts, on a scholarship for women who had missed out on their education. She is very striking and you can see why, in her mid-30s, Ford Models signed her up. She became the first woman to model a men\u2019s collection, but, as hyped as it was then, it reads like a footnote in her life. She is now married to an international human rights expert.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Legler after coming last in her heat in 1996, the day after she broke the Olympic record in practice.

The other is that she has Asperger\u2019s \u2013 she was diagnosed the day after she finished her book. To mitigate against sensory overload she might experience because of it, I have brought my dog to the interview. So, with a staffordshire bull terrier curled up against her on the banquette, she calmly shatters any illusions the public may have about what it is like to be a child sporting prodigy, especially if you are a girl.\n\nShe is, she says, surprised she is not dead. \u201cI do know a couple of people who stopped drinking and taking drugs in their 20s and went on to have beautiful families,\u201d she says, \u201cbut, for an athlete, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the norm; that\u2019s the exception. But I can only speak to what it was like for me.\n\n\u201cWorking hard and drinking hard is just how we did it. Some of them were able to stop because they got to university and quit swimming, and some of them did not. Some of them died and some of them continue to struggle with drugs and alcohol.\u201d\n\nLegler was one of five children born to American parents. When she was a small child, the family lived in St Maxime, Cote D\u2019Azur, then spent two years in Louisiana, before returning to France when Legler was 12. Her mother gave up working as an artist after having children. \u201cMom spent her time crying,\u201d Legler writes, somewhat ambiguously. \u201cWe knew to pretend it wasn\u2019t happening.\u201d\n\nHer father, a professional basketball player who became an architect, she describes as \u201ca gorgeous, handsome, very smart, highly problematic patriarch. I was raised in a very patriarchal household where young girls were second class. It was very complicated for them to have such a high-functioning young person as a daughter. I was on the spectrum. I was a really complicated person.\u201d\n\nWhen she moved back to France, her mother took her to meet a swimming coach in Aix-en-Provence. There is an uncomfortable passage in her book describing this decisive encounter: \u201cI see him understand that he\u2019s hit the genetic jackpot with me. I am very skinny, and at 12, I am already just shy of 6ft tall \u2013 I am currency.\u201d\n\nThe coach took her on and within two years she was taking part in international swimming meets around Europe, away from her parents but also unsupervised. Already her understanding of adults \u201cwas that they couldn\u2019t give two fucks about kids, and the only time they cared was when it impacted them\u201d. It is an attitude she came to see everywhere in her new life as a swimming prodigy. \u201cWhere were the adults? And if they were near, terrible things happened. In my book, I just wanted to lay into the normality of it. Hannah Arendt talks about the banality of evil. Not all the adults around us were perpetrators, but all of them looked the other way.\u201d\n\nThe book spans her entire swimming career. \u201cBetween the ages of 12 and 20 \u2013 that\u2019s very young, right? To have the discipline I had to develop, to have the responsibilities I had,\u201d she says. \u201cBy the time you were 14, you were a professional athlete, you were put into a swimming programme of some sort. I took a correspondence course for my last years of high school. The only time you were around adults was at practice. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Legler at the Michael Bastian show at New York fashion week, 2013.

Incredibly, during this time she did not enjoy swimming. The team was often on the road, away from parents or living in boarding facilities at France\u2019s elite training institutes.\n\n\u201cI was one of 20 other girl swimmers at the hands of one coach. A one-to-20 ratio is not a good one,\u201d she says. By the time she was 14, she says, when not in the pool \u201cwe were just left alone. I could do whatever I wanted. So, on training trips, there was this juxtaposition between being given absolute freedom to do what I liked by the adults who were meant to be taking care of me and the absolute control these same adults had of my body; from when I got up to what I ate, how I trained, when I practised.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t unusual for this control to tip into abuse. When she was 13, she was sexually assaulted by a physiotherapist during a treatment. She likens what he did to what Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor, was last year convicted of doing to hundreds of girls in his charge. \u201cIt was the same procedure: \u2018Are you sure? Are you OK with this?\u2019 It\u2019s so classic. I think that\u2019s the thing we have to understand. These are not accidents. These are routine.\u201d\n\nYet this was not the only abuse she faced. \u201cIt\u2019s very common to be raped by someone you know,\u201d she says. She was still a virgin when two men raped her on a messy night out. Yet despite the scrutiny of her body, she says, physical signs of the assault were ignored by those around her. \u201cI walked on to the pool deck after being raped, with bruises on the inside of my thighs.\u201d\n\nIt was the same attitude when anyone was injured, she says. \u201cWe would show up in the training room with injuries: tendonitis in the shoulders \u2013 cortisone shots. \u2018In you go.\u2019 Ice patch, ice bath. \u2018Get back in the water.\u2019 It was a continual Band-Aid.\u201d\n\nThen there was the time a doctor handed her a bag of unlabelled powder: \u201cThe next day \u2013 I\u2019d never swum so fast in my life.\u201d She puts what she calls \u201cthe normalisation of neglect\u201d down to the fact that \u201cthe cost of looking would have required a person of great character, which simply ... they were not around\u201d.\n\nInstead, she was left to deal with \u201cthis incessant violence, the incessant darkness that launched into my world over and over and over again\u201d in any way she could, whether that be \u201cirreverence, drugs and alcohol, breaking rules\u201d. And all around her, she saw peers doing the same. \u201cWe knew this was happening to everyone.\u201d\n\nLegler\u2019s hard drinking began at 15. She says her fast teenage metabolism allowed her to be both an alcoholic and an Olympic-level athlete. And she says the numbing effects of both swimming and alcohol, as toxic as they were to her, \u201csaved my life\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With her partner Siri Olsen, 2018.

And alongside all this drinking and drugs was a kind of hooliganism. In the book, she describes an initiation ceremony among the young swimming team: \u201cWe make all the freshmen drink 100 shots of vodka that night for hazing and all the girls shave their vaginas and with their mouths pick cherries hanging off the dicks of the freshman guys. The vodka winner has a bucket next to her to throw up in as she keeps drinking shot after shot after shot.\u201d\n\nThe French swim team, she says, \u201cwere quite proud of the reputation that we had as being the ones that partied the hardest\u201d at international meets \u2013 whether it was the Olympics or the European championships.\n\n\u201cI think that pride came from a place of absolute irreverence and disdain for the institution that we were representing. We took power back where we could and in typical adolescent fashion, by breaking all of the rules given to us by, in most cases, adults who we didn\u2019t respect at all because we knew what they were doing behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cGrowing up with them, you know the swimmers that are insane partiers and that was very much the reputation I had by the time the French team got to the Olympics. It was no accident people asked me to score drugs.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, Legler showed up at the Olympics with a shaved head. If anyone had bothered to ask her about it, they would have discovered it was a protest against the expectations that she felt the girls in the team faced. \u201cThe coaches wanted the girls to be beautiful and thin,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the 90s, you had heroin chic coupled with the French ideas about fashion and beauty.\u201d Many of the girls, Legler says, including herself, had eating disorders.\n\nAfter Atlanta, Legler went off the rails altogether. \u201cMy life became darker as I got to 19 and 20 and I got more involved with gangs and drug dealing. That teenage irreverence and spikiness turned into total intimidation, with me using my height and my body to keep myself safe and, in other instances, to make other people afraid,\u201d she writes.\n\n\u201cI became more and more violent the more I drank. In the end, that was a known fact about me that I was very, very in touch with \u2013 how to wield cruelty or fear. I was a dangerous person.\u201d\n\nOn 23 April 1998, three days before her 21st birthday, she went to rehab for the second time. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been clean ever since. Knock on wood. I never used again. And I stopped swimming the year after. Even in that year, I felt like I was tearing my skin off. Everything came out \u2013 the cutting came back, the eating disorder. That first year was very painful. Then I got my first job bagging groceries in a supermarket. On a good day it was humbling, but on a bad day it was deeply humiliating because I hadn\u2019t understood how I had gotten there.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest At Paris fashion week spring summer 2014 with Tilda Swinton and Karl Lagerfeld. Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nFor years, she says, she could not talk about her life as an athlete. \u201cI had such a specific experience of torment and failure and in my heart, deep shame. It took many years afterwards to even tell anyone that I had been at the Olympics, and that I had broken the record the day before, then totally bombed and the day after had organised myself to deal drugs to my fellow athletes. It was so much not the story people wanted to hear.\u201d\n\nShe began to re-evaluate her experiences after the therapist she was seeing told her: \u201c\u2018You are walking around as an adult with rancour and fear in your heart. You can do something about that. With it you will help ease the misery of others.\u2019 And it\u2019s like a super power.\u201d\n\nNow she wants her book to be a comfort to children and adults who have shared similar experiences. The paedophile physiotherapist is dead, so she won\u2019t be taking him to court, but she can influence whether other girls and women will be molested like she was. The good news, she says, \u201cis that people are on to it. The bad news is that that means bad things are still happening to young people.\u201d\n\nAlongside making sure girls are not left alone, as she was, with male doctors and coaches, she thinks the age that young athletes turn professional should be raised. \u201cAs an adolescent athlete, I was not showing any of the normal signs of someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy something. I was still swimming extraordinarily fast, I was still very much performing well at school \u2013 the best in my class. But just because someone is at the top of their game does not indicate they are happy.\n\n\u201cI want us to be talking more about what it might mean to be a young girl, to be very, very good at what you\u2019re doing and to come up within the system which is the patriarchy. At its mildest, it considers you disposable, in a way that it certainly doesn\u2019t consider young men and boys.\u201d\n\nShe is optimistic things can change. \u201cWe can start talking about this in a way that is constructive and takes care of our young and they can have long, happy careers.\u201d\n\nLegler has started swimming again and, along with her advocacy work, including with the UN (she is moderating a panel about women\u2019s equality and empowerment next week), modelling and work as an artist, she has spent the past decade mentoring formerly incarcerated children. \u201cOne of them asked me: \u2018Is it hard being soft?\u2019 And I was able to tell her it was the best thing that had happened to me.\u201d\n\nGodspeed by Casey Legler is published by Scribe (\u00a314.99).
