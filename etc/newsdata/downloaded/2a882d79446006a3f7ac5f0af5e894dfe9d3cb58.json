And as Scandimania has taken hold around the world over the past few years, there\u2019s been a steady stream of new tourists landing in the Danish capital.\n\nThe increase in visitors has prompted a surge in new hotels, but Copenhagen can still be an expensive city, and choosing the right hotel is vital. So let me help. I grew up here, and still visit several times a year, spending my adult life testing the hotels. Here\u2019s my pick of those which hit the right balance between style, price and comfort.\n\nThe Independent's hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.

Regardless of size, however, they all have the same clean Nordic design and functionality \u2013 plus upmarket REN toiletries.\n\nThe well-stocked bar claims to have the largest selection of port wine in Denmark and serves an organic lager, brewed especially for the hotel. Best of all? The daily wine hour, between 5pm and 6pm.\n\nDoubles from DKK1250 (\u00a3148), B&B\n\nbrochner-hotels.dk\u200b\n\nBest for urban cool: The Andersen\n\nBook direct with The Andersen, and instead of a set check-in and check-out time, you\u2019ll get your room for a straight 24 hours.
