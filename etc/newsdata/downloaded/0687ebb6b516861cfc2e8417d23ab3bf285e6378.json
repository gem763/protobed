He also revealed that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban leaders were originally scheduled to arrive in the U.S. tonight.\n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for a car bombing in Kabul that killed 12 people, including a U.S. soldier, on Thursday.\n\nIn his tweet, Trump said they admitted to the attack to \u201cin order to build false leverage\u201d in their negotiations.\n\n\u201cI immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations,\u201d the president said \u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d\n\nUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\n....an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn\u2019t, they.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\n....only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\nPresident Ghani was scheduled to meet with Trump early next week but reportedly postponed the trip, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBefore the Kabul bombing, U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad announced that the U.S. had reached an agreement with the Taliban \u201con principle.\u201d Khalilzad reportedly rushed back to Qatar, where his negotiations with the Taliban had taken place, after the attack.\n\nTrump has long been a proponent of withdrawing the U.S. from Afghanistan and the recent peace talks between U.S. diplomats and the Taliban, which was reportedly close to a resolution, were part of those efforts, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has been working for months to broker a peace deal, Trump has previously criticized former President Barack Obama for attempting the same.\n\nIn 2012, he described the Taliban as a \u201csworn enemy\u201d of the U.S. \u201cwho facilitated 9/11\u2033 while drawing attention to the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to negotiate with the insurgent group.\n\nWhile @BarackObama is slashing the military, he is also negotiating with our sworn enemy the Taliban--who facilitated 9/11. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2012\n\nDemocrats in Congress pointed out the irony of Trump inviting the Taliban into the country four days before the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks carried out by Al Qaeda.\n\nResponding to Trump\u2019s tweet late Saturday, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) wrote to the president: \u201cYou brought the Taliban to the United States the week of September 11?\u201d\n\nIn his own late-night tweet, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) called Republicans \u201chypocrites.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf [Obama] ever invited the Taliban to Camp David during the week of 9/11\u2026 My point is that Republicans are hypocrites who will never criticize President Trump no matter what he does.\u201d\n\nYou brought the Taliban to the United States the week of September 11? https://t.co/oxXYweNAOi \u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) September 8, 2019\n\nIf @BarackObama ever invited the Taliban to Camp David during the week of 9/11...\n\n\n\nMy point is that Republicans are hypocrites who will never criticize President Trump no matter what he does. \u2014 David Cicilline (@davidcicilline) September 8, 2019", "description": "President Donald Trump said he canceled the Camp David meeting after the Taliban claimed responsibility for a deadly bomb attack in Kabul earlier this week.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d743713240000082477c6a8.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
