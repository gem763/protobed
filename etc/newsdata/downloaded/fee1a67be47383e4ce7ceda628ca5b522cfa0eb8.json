As a staunch fan of the entire Olsen family \u2014 and a person who inherently trusts Vulture\u2019s Matt Zoller Seitz, who\u2019s been one of the loudest voices rallying for the series since its inception \u2014 I had Sorry for Your Loss open in a tab for months, but couldn\u2019t bring myself to press play. Earlier this month, I finally did, and ended up bingeing the entire thing in a few hours. (I don\u2019t recommend doing this unless you have an extremely hearty constitution.) I laughed, I cried dangerously onto my laptop keyboard, and I developed a profound obsession with Janet McTeer, who plays Olsen\u2019s delightfully woo-woo single mother, Amy, the sort of woman who sends her kids to psychics and offers her daughter psychedelics during a particularly dark bout of depression.\n\nAs the show\u2019s central character, Olsen is consistently wonderful, displaying an impressive emotional range she\u2019s been hiding behind Wanda Maximoff\u2019s red pleather, but the second season in particular gives McTeer a chance to show off those storied thespian skills she\u2019s quietly refined for decades. The third episode \u2014 entitled \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong With Your Chest?\u201d \u2014 is almost entirely centered on McTeer\u2019s Amy: Ruffled by a pre-Christmas family therapy session in which the psychologist suggests she\u2019s overly involved in her daughters\u2019 lives, she stays awake for 24 hours, rifling through old boxes and her own memory. She shows up at the family\u2019s Christmas dinner all raw nerves and trip wires, and soon, she\u2019s splintering apart in a long, searing monologue that sees her veering between grief, anger, regret, horror, and sadness. It\u2019s a nuanced, devastating performance. McTeer sinks her teeth in so hard that she hits bone.\n\nJanet McTeer\u2019s searing Sorry for Your Loss monologue. Photo: Facebook Watch\n\nAt the end of the episode, Amy announces to her daughters that she\u2019s going to Alaska for an unspecified amount of time; she doesn\u2019t appear at all in the episodes released since. I was desperate to talk to McTeer about all of it, so she called me from her house in Maine, where, she explained, she\u2019d just arrived after filming Ozark in Atlanta. \u201cI\u2019m a little tired and I have a very small brain,\u201d she laughed. \u201cBut I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nTalk to me about first getting involved in Sorry for Your Loss. I know you were really busy when they came to you with the project. What made you sign on?\n\nSpeaking with Kit. It\u2019s her child, as it were. I really liked her. I really liked everyone behind the project. I really liked Lizzie [Olsen] as an actress. I liked the subject matter. People shy away from that because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll say the wrong thing, or think they\u2019re gonna mess up somehow. It\u2019s a program about how messy it all is, how difficult it all is, how long it all takes, the ramifications both good and bad on a family. It\u2019s a really important story. You don\u2019t get to be my age without witnessing grief, sadly. So I felt that lots of people would be able to relate to it. I felt like it would help people.\n\nThis season specifically, your character gets a lot more time and a lot more care. When did you realize that\u2019d be the case?\n\nI felt very strongly, and so did Kit, that [we needed to represent] the stages of grief, as it were. There\u2019s the immediate emergency stage, when everyone is still reeling and in shock. But when you get beyond that, it\u2019s \u201cHow do you go on with your life?\u201d Kit really wanted to explore what happens when you become a caretaker again, when you thought your caretaking days were more or less over. You\u2019re an empty nester, but when something like this happens, you become a carer again. That was a wonderful thing to be able to explore. There\u2019s a lot of women involved in the series, and that\u2019s been a powerful thing. It\u2019s very female-driven and female-led, and everyone is very nurturing and empowering.\n\nThe episode in question hinges on the idea that, in trying to compensate for her own mother\u2019s mistakes as a parent, Amy overcorrects and gets too involved in her daughters\u2019 lives. Do you think she\u2019s a good mom?\n\nI think all parents do that. Everyone thinks, Oh, my dad did this, therefore I\u2019m going to do this. It\u2019s human nature to try and correct what we see as the mistakes of our parents. As you go along, you realize, They were just doing their best; we\u2019re just doing our best. We all mess up. It\u2019s impossible to be a perfect parent. The only thing that you can ask of any parent, ever, is \u2014 given the knowledge that they have, given the resources that they have \u2014 did they do the very best they could? If the answer is yes, they\u2019re a really good parent.\n\nAmy brought her kids up by herself. Of the many single women I know who\u2019ve brought up their children by themselves, there\u2019s almost always a slight control-freak factor. They have to do it all themselves; they have no choice. Because they don\u2019t have anybody taking half the brunt, it\u2019s a huge amount of work for a single parent. It\u2019s par for the course to be a control freak. Do I think she\u2019s a great mother? Absolutely. What else can you ask for? She\u2019s the most loving and caring that she could possibly be. Does she get it wrong? Of course she does. We all do. But we\u2019re only human.\n\nTo me, she reads as a great mom. I was surprised by what the therapist said. I also love that she gives her daughter DMT and encourages her to trip as a way to deal with her grief.\n\n[Laughs loudly.] Good for her!\n\nWould you do that as a parent?\n\nAmy\u2019s a bit out there. I think in the real world, these psychedelic meds were created for psychiatric purposes and became a popular drug later. She obviously buys into that and believes it can really help. [Laughs.] Good for her. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d do the same thing, but \u2026\n\nDo you feel a maternal connection to Elizabeth Olsen and Kelly Marie-Tran? Do they come to you for advice?\n\nI feel very connected to them. I love them as women. They\u2019re delightful and funny, and they have their hearts and heads in the right place. I\u2019m very, very fond of them both. It\u2019s more like friends than [maternal advice], but I have been around the block a few times. [Laughs.]\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the monologue. What did you think when you first saw it on the page?\n\nI knew where the character was going and what was going to happen. I worked on it for ages, thought about it a lot, and took what I felt was great about the speech and what was missing and brought it to [the writers]. They were brilliant. They listened.\n\nWhat did you want to add?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that it was specifically missing, but you feel like it\u2019s your character. There were little things. I am a woman in my 50s, so I thought there was a certain ways of saying things that were very different from somebody who was writing it. We didn\u2019t change that much.\n\nWhat sort of preparation did you do?\n\nI worked on the speech for three weeks. I thought about every word and sentence. I put myself in situations where I could imagine feeling like that \u2014 how resentful you\u2019d feel. And breaking it down point by point, so it wasn\u2019t just generalized emotion, but specific thoughts. I worked on it every day.\n\nWhat was the most difficult part for you?\n\nThe hardest thing about it, honestly, is you have to do it so many times. It\u2019s about maximizing it, keeping the energy and focus for such a long time.\n\nYou\u2019ve said in interviews before that you\u2019re very sensitive. How do you shake off those heavy emotions?\n\nI don\u2019t know that I shake it off. I just try as best as I can to give justice to that kind of heartbreak, how hard it is to be a single mom, try and be everything to everyone, and then losing yourself. You just don\u2019t recognize yourself anymore. You\u2019ve got lost. That happens to so many people. I can\u2019t speak for men because I\u2019m not a guy, but I can speak for women. I want to do as much justice and work as hard as I can on the agony and the trauma of being a woman in that situation: messing up the way she\u2019s messed up, realizing she\u2019s messed up, and trying to sort it out.\n\nWhat was the mood in the room like while you filmed it? Was it heavy or were you trying to lighten it up for each other?\n\nEveryone was really \u2026 it was too hard. That\u2019s one of those times where everyone knuckles down. Every time we finished a take, I\u2019d put my music on and I\u2019d slip off to one side to stay in the zone. All the other actors were amazing. Everyone was very appreciative of how hard of a thing it is to do, so they were quiet and focused until we were done. You can\u2019t eat when you film scenes like that \u2014 you just can\u2019t \u2014 so after the scene was done I had a very large ice cream. [Laughs.]\n\nHow often are you thinking about your own experiences with grief, your own losses, while filming scenes like these?\n\nNot at all, really. Once you\u2019re actually doing the character, you shouldn\u2019t be thinking about those things at all. When you\u2019ve been prepping, you\u2019re thinking about those things for yourself and you\u2019re drawing on that. But by the time you\u2019re performing, you\u2019re drawing on your character\u2019s memories. When I was talking about the times when the kids got into bed with me, I was speaking about Elizabeth and Kelly. I wasn\u2019t thinking about myself.\n\nThe show hasn\u2019t really grappled with this concept, outside of the DMT scene, but I\u2019m curious what you think happens after we die.\n\nHmm, I do not know. I really don\u2019t know. And I\u2019m happy not to know.", "description": "Janet McTeer talks about her searing monologue in \u201cSorry for Your Loss\u201d season two, her friendships with co-stars Elizabeth Olsen and Kelly Marie Tran, and what happens when we die.", "authors": ["Rachel Handler"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/10/10-janet-mcteer-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
