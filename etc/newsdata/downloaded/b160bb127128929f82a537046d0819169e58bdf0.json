With that said, some things can be considered overhauls that come with big impacts, like the new privacy settings.\n\nFew Android phones from other phone makers are getting the Android 10 update as early as Tuesday, and it\u2019s not clear when phones from companies like Samsung, LG, and OnePlus will be getting the Android 10 update.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nGoogle began rolling out the Android 10 version of its Android mobile operating system on Tuesday to Pixel devices, including the original Pixel, Pixel 2, and Pixel 3 phones.\n\nAs with the past few versions of Android, there are some new features and updates that may not be immediately obvious. You could even miss them if you don\u2019t know what to look for.\n\nThat would be a shame, since some of these new features are pretty helpful. To help you get the most out of Android 10, Business Insider has compiled a list of features to look out when you get the update.\n\nCheck it out:\n\n10. Smart Reply gives you useful shortcuts to apps that might be relevant to notifications.\n\n9. New swipe gestures!\n\nTo go back in Android 10, you\u2019ll need to swipe right from the left edge of the screen instead of pressing the back button, which has been a staple of the Android OS for years.\n\nYou can also swipe left or right on the bottom of the screen to flick through your recently opened apps.\n\nTo go back home with the new gestures option, you just swipe up from the bottom of the screen.\n\n8. Live Caption will add handy text captions to your videos, as well as to podcasts and audio messages, without needing an internet connection.\n\n7. A new app called Sound Amplifier can boost the sound you want to hear and filter out background noise. Quick \u2014 and odd \u2014 disclaimer: It works only with wired headphones.\n\nsource Google\n\n6. Photos can be saved in the HEIF format, which means they use up less space and look just as good as the old JPEG format.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\n5. Privacy becomes easier on Android 10.\n\nsource Google\n\nPrivacy is getting its own spot in the Android 10 settings, where all the privacy settings like app permissions, account activity, and personal data will be found in one place.\n\nThat\u2019s a major improvement to the privacy settings in Android 9, where privacy settings are dispersed through different settings and you have to find app privacy settings within each app.\n\n4. You get more control over which apps get permission to access your location data.\n\nsource Google\n\nWith Android 10 you can customize how the apps on your phone access your location data: all the time; only when you use the app; or never. And Android 10 will even remind you if you gave apps access to your location all the time, in case you decide you want to change that.\n\n3. Android 10 phones will receive security updates like an app update in the Google Play store, making it faster and easier for people to get the latest security updates.\n\nsource Google\n\n2. With a new \u201cFocus Mode,\u201d you can temporarily pause apps that might distract you when you\u2019re trying to get something else done.\n\n1. Android 10 has the option for a system-wide dark mode, which is more comfortable for your eyes and easier on your battery.", "description": "Business Insider - Android 10 will look pretty similar to Android 9, but there are new updates and features you don't want to miss..
