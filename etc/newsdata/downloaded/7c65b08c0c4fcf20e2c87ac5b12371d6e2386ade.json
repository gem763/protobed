Biological subjects may be killed and dyed so that their structure can be seen if being mounted on a glass slide for photographing using ordinary light microscopes.\n\nAlternatively living, unstained specimens can be photographed using ultraviolet, infrared, electron, or X-ray microscopes.", "description": "The winners of the Nikon Small World Photomicrography Competition 2019 have been announced and the top spot was taken by two experts from New York City.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/18/20046798-0-image-a-47_1571764227442.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
