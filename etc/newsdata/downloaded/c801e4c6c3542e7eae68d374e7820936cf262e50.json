Bernie Sanders may have a point when he says that billionaires shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cAt some level, no one deserves to have that much money.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Facebook Inc. Chief Executive \u2014 and billionaire many times over \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg said late Thursday during an employee Q&A session, when asked what he thought about Sanders\u2019 recent comment. The session was livestreamed to the public, offering a rare glimpse into Facebook\u2019s internal goings-on, after audio from a July meeting was recently leaked to The Verge in which Zuckerberg spoke candidly about critics, competitors and government regulation, saying he would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fight Sen Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal to break up Facebook.\n\n\u201cOur internal Q&As at Facebook are one of my favorite traditions, and after the transcript of one of them was published online earlier this week, I thought it would be good to show everyone what these Q&As are like,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post minutes before the meeting.\n\nRead: Barr wants Facebook to give authorities access to encrypted messaging\n\nZuckerberg said Thursday that he believes an intern leaked the video, \u201cbecause it was an intern Q&A.\u201d\n\nLast month, Democratic presidential candidate Sanders unveiled a plan to tax the most wealthy Americans, saying flat out: \u201cThere should be no billionaires.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about that comment Thursday by an employee, Zuckerberg said having billionaires may not be fair, but it\u2019s reality.\n\n\u201cIs it fair that a group of wealthy people get to choose which science projects get worked on? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAt some level it\u2019s not fair, but it may be optimal or better than the alternative,\u201d adding that it was better than the government picking the winners. Zuckerberg also noted that many billionaires, including himself, give large donations to charity and research.\n\nFacebook shares FB, +2.74% rose Thursday and are up 37% year to date, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.80% 16% gain in 2019.", "description": "At least one billionaire thinks Sen.
