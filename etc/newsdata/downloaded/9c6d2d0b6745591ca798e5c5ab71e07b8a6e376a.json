It shows the brand power of Apple, which had only unveiled a handful of upcoming originals for its service by the time the Flixed survey was conducted, including trailers for \"The Morning Show\" and \"For All Mankind.\" It was also clear by the time of the survey that Apple's offering would not include a back catalog of licensed content, like the ones legacy media companies Disney, WarnerMedia, and HBO Max are relying on to flush out their platforms.\n\nFlixed's survey was conducted, via Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service, from August 23-26.\n\nThat was around the point that Disney ramped up marketing for Disney Plus during its biannual fan convention, D23. It was also before Apple announced the $5 monthly price tag and initial show lineup for Apple TV Plus. And it was before NBCUniversal revealed the name of its upcoming streaming offering, Peacock, and details on the programming that would be included in it.\n\nRead more: How Disney Plus, HBO Max, and NBC's Peacock streaming service stack up in the battle against Netflix\n\nAn earlier August survey by Wall Street research firm UBS also found that about 40% of the US respondents were \"likely\" to subscribe to Disney Plus when it became available.\n\nRead more: A new survey finds Disney Plus has a huge advantage in signing up subscribers but shouldn't be considered a Netflix killer\n\nDisney Plus is already available in the Netherlands, where Disney released the service early to work out the kinks. Aside from a few annoyances, like the service's failure to remember the point in a show or movie a viewer left off after pausing or stopping the video, users seemed generally pleased with it, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nStill, some analysts are concerned about how much money Disney will need to spend to keep the service stocked with fresh content, and keep users coming back month after month, with so many other offerings out there. JPMorgan, which is bullish on Disney longterm, slashed its earnings forecast for Disney's upcoming fourth quarter, in part because of growing streaming costs.\n\nIt was unclear from the Flixed survey what kind of impact subscriptions to upcoming services like Disney Plus would have on existing offerings like Netflix.\n\nThe majority of respondents \u2014 46% \u2014 said they were unsure whether they would cancel an existing streaming service if they signed up for an upcoming one. About 22% said they would cancel an existing service, and 32% said they would not.", "description": "Disney Plus has drummed up more interest among US streaming users than other forthcoming services like Apple TV Plus and HBO Max, a survey found.", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9dda553b33a77ad77940d6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
