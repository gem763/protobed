Many animals are able to feel P-waves, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).\n\nIn general, communities farthest away from the epicenter of a quake would receive the most advance warning.\n\nAlready, the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in and around San Francisco has connected the early detection network to its rail service to automatically slow down its trains, and reduce the risk of a derailment in the event of a major quake.\n\nThe MyShake app, which was designed by University of California, Berkeley, seismologists and engineers, will initially alert users to earthquakes of a magnitude 4.5 or greater in their area.\n\nWarnings are based on a computer program called ShakeAlert operated by the U.S. Geological Survey that analyzes data from seismic networks statewide, calculates preliminary magnitudes, and then estimates which areas will feel shaking, according to the governor's office.\n\nJapan developed the world's most advanced earthquake early warning system after the 1995 Kobe earthquake, based on the same principles of physics as California's.\n\nOfficials in Los Angeles County in January introduced a \"ShakeAlertLA\" mobile phone application that can transmit an early warning to residents who have installed the app, giving them extra seconds to take cover before a major quake hits.\n\nThe 6.9 magnitude Loma Prieta quake struck during a national broadcast of the 1989 World Series and experts have said the lighter-than-normal traffic because of the baseball game may have prevented a greater loss of life.\n\n(Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "description": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California rolled out the nation's first statewide earthquake warning system on Thursday, designed to detect seismic waves and alert residents through a mobile phone app even before the ground starts shaking.", "authors": ["Dan Whitcomb"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
