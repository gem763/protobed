Unless something changes, that scene will continue to play out across America.\n\nFlorida school resource officer Dennis Turner was fired Monday after he arrested two 6-year-olds on misdemeanor battery charges at an Orlando charter school in two separate incidents.\n\nHe handcuffed a little boy and girl. And, according to reports, the girl was assigned a juvenile case number for what appears to have been a rough temper tantrum.\n\nIn response, Orlando State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced that the charges against both children would be dropped, stating that she refuses to \"knowingly play any role in the school-to-prison pipeline.\" The prison system, she went on to say, is not the place to address common behavior issues. \"These very young children are to be protected, nurtured and disciplined in a way that does not rely on the criminal justice system.\"\n\nOrlando Police Chief Orlando Rol\u00f3n issued a statement apologizing for Turner's actions, stating that he had \u201ctaken steps to ensure this does not occur in the future.\u201d\n\nChildren as young as 6 are getting handcuffed in schools across America.

The officer was disciplined and a state attorney quickly stepped in to shield the kids from the justice system's revolving door \u2014 part of the permanent damage that a record this young can bring.\n\nPolicing the USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nBut we should be wary of thinking that these arrests, which violated police department protocol, were lone incidents perpetuated by one \"bad apple\" cop.\n\nThe reality is that this is not the first time that children this young have been arrested at a school in America for normal childhood behaviors, pushed into that pipeline that the state attorney so eloquently railed against. Ayala even admitted that her state of Florida has been one the nation's worst actors.\n\nAnd damage from the pipeline is not equally inflicted. The punishments are more frequently used against children of color. And black girls are more harshly disciplined, and seen as less in need of the nurture Ayala mentioned than their white counterparts.\n\nIn Florida in 2015, black youth were placed in the system at a rate that was more than four times higher than their white counterparts according to The Sentencing Project.\n\nUnless something changes, last week's incidents will be far from the last we'll hear about across the country. And black girls will continue to be hit especially hard.\n\nMore officers, less safety\n\nMany school districts have responded to the threat of mass shootings by increasing the number of police officers in schools \u2014 an understandable response propelled by the desire to increase safety.\n\nHowever, officers make schools more dangerous for black girls, not safer. For these students, normal behaviors are frequently criminalized, and the likelihood that they get caught in the school-to-confinement pipeline increases.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union, 14 million students go to schools that have officers but lack counselors, nurses, psychologists or social workers.\n\nAs Monique Morris describes in her book \"Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools,\" black girls are pushed out of educational settings and into group homes or the juvenile justice system at disproportionate rates, especially when compared with their white peers.\n\nPushed out and punished:Woman's story shows how systems are failing black girls\n\nAccording to the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, during the 2015-16 school year, black girls were 8% of the student population but accounted for 14% of school suspensions. Black students represented 15% of the national student body population but 31% of students referred to law enforcement or arrested in school. Whites are nearly half of the student population but represent 36% of encounters with law enforcement.\n\nAre black girls getting punished at a higher rate because they are misbehaving more frequently than their white counterparts? No, not according to data on girls and discipline. In Pennsylvania, for example, Sara Goodkind collected information from groups in the Pittsburgh area that shows white girls and black girls engage in the same kinds of behaviors and at roughly the same rate.\n\nSo why are black girls getting disciplined more frequently?\n\nBlack girls are often suspended for what are termed \u201cdiscretionary offenses,\u201d in which a teacher or administrator makes a judgment call about a girl\u2019s behavior, such as whether a child is being defiant or disrespectful. Often, these judgment calls allow leeway for implicit biases based on race.\n\nTeachers may misinterpret trauma-related behavior \u2014 struggles to focus in class, sleeping in class, being irritable \u2014 as being disrespectful.\n\nIn addition, adults view black girls as less in need of nurture, protection, support and comfort than white girls of the same age, according to research by Jamilia Blake and colleagues from the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality.\n\nAs a result, school officials might respond to black girls with less compassion and more discipline. Police may act on these same biases when making decisions about whether to arrest a child.\n\nTrain staff better and use fewer cops\n\nWhat's the solution?\n\nSchools need more anti-bias-trained counselors and fewer cops.\n\nMany of the schools that do have mental health professionals are often not meeting basic guidelines, such as having a counselor and a social worker for every 250 students.\n\nPittsburgh's Black Girls Equity Alliance is one of many community groups pushing schools to focus on trauma-informed (instead of punishment-driven) approaches for young black girls. The group developed a program that trains practitioners on the best ways to do this.\n\nIn June, New York City officials and the city police department came to an agreement that will significantly change the way police operate in schools. The agreement includes implementing techniques for de-escalation and \"equitable school-based disciplinary practices.\"\n\nBut efforts like these alone cannot end the school-to-confinement pipeline. Nor will they make schools completely safe for black girls. As long as police officers have a strong presence in schools, they will respond the way they are trained \u2014 by detaining and arresting.\n\nIt is time to reduce the number of officers on our school campuses and train all school administrators to see young black girls not as suspects but as students.\n\nSchools should be safe learning environments for all of our children.\n\nBritney Brinkman, is an associate professor of psychology at Point Park University and a founding member of the Pittsburgh-based Black Girls Equity Alliance \u2014 a coalition working to address inequities black girls experience in various systems.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2019/09/27/officers-school-campuses-danger-black-girls/2446239001/", "description": "Last week two Florida 6-year-olds were arrested.
