When he stepped out of his SUV, three Iraqi guards turned him around at gunpoint.\n\nAs he walked back to the vehicle, he heard an AK-47 being racked and a hail of cursing in Arabic and Kurdish. He turned to see Azaz facing off with the Iraqis.\n\n\"Let us through or I'll kill you all,\" Walker recalled his Kurdish bodyguard telling the Iraqi soldiers, who he described as \"terrified.\"\n\nHe thought to himself: \"This is the kind of ally and friend I want.\"\n\nNow retired and living in Portland, Oregon, the 66-year-old former Army Special Forces soldier is among legions of U.S. servicemembers with a deep gratitude and respect for Kurdish fighters they served alongside through the Iraq war and, more recently, conflicts with the Islamic State. So he was \"furious\" when President Donald Trump this month abruptly decided to pull 1,000 U.S. troops from northeast Syria, clearing the way for Turkey to move in on Kurdish-controlled territory.\n\nWalker's rage was echoed in Reuters interviews with a half dozen other current and former U.S. soldiers who have served with Kurdish forces. Mark Giaconia, a 46-year-old former U.S. Army special forces soldier, recalled similar camaraderie with the Kurds he fought with in Iraq more than a decade ago.\n\n\"I trusted them with my life,\" said Giaconia, who now lives in Herndon, Virginia, after retiring from the Army with 20 years of service. \"I fought with these guys and watched them die for us.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to \"leave them hanging\" stirred deep emotions, Giaconia said.\n\n\"It's like a violation of trust,\" he said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nBIPARTISAN CRITICISM\n\nTrump's abrupt decision to pull back U.S. troops from along the Syria-Turkey border allowed Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to launch an offensive into the region aimed at creating a 20 mile (32 km) \"safe zone\" clear of the Kurdish YPG militia. The Kurdish fighters had been Washington's main ally in the region but the Turkish government regards them as a terrorist group.\n\nIn the face of criticism from both Democrats and his own Republicans, Trump defended the move, saying that it fulfilled a campaign promise to reduce foreign troop presence and asserting that the Kurds were \"not angels.\"\n\nThe Kurds pivoted quickly, allying themselves with Syria to try to hold off the Turkish onslaught.\n\nTrump then sent Vice President Michael Pence to Ankara to negotiate a pause in the fighting that the United States said would allow the Kurds to pull back from the area Turkey aimed to take, and which Turkey said achieved the main goal of the assault it launched Oct. 9.\n\nCongressional Republicans - including Senator Lindsey Graham, normally a staunch Trump ally - fretted that the move would risk allowing the Islamic State militant group to resurge.\n\n\"Congress is going to speak with a very firm, singular voice,\" Graham said at a Thursday news conference to unveil legislation to impose new sanctions on the Turkish government. He said the \"Turkish outrage\" would lead to the re-emergence of Islamic State, the destruction of an ally - the Kurds - and eventually benefit Iran at the expense of Israel.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted 354 to 60 last week to condemn Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria - a rare case of Republicans voting en masse against Trump. A Senate vote on the resolution was blocked, however, by Republican Senator Rand Paul.\n\nPaul, a senator from Kentucky, has voiced his support Trump's withdrawal of troops, saying during a Senate hearing on Thursday that \"the Constitution is quite clear, no authorization has ever been given for the use of forces in Syria.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF 'BETRAYAL'\n\nSome of the U.S. soldiers interviewed by Reuters pointed out that the United States has history of forging alliances with Kurdish forces only to later abandon them. In the 1970s, the administration of President Richard Nixon secretly agreed to funnel money to Iraqi Kurds fighting for autonomy from Iraq, only to drop that aid after Iraq and Iran reached a peace treaty to end border disputes in 1975.\n\nLikewise after the 1991 Gulf War, a Kurdish uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein eventually led to a brutal crackdown after U.S. forces left the region.", "description": "In the summer of 2004, U.S. soldier Greg Walker drove to a checkpoint just outside of Baghdad's Green Zone with his Kurdish bodyguard, Azaz.
