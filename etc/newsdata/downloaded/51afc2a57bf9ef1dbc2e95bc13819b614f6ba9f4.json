[Photo/mod.gov.cn]\n\nThe Chinese Minister of National Defense said on Monday the Chinese military is resolute in safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, noting China is the only major country still striving for national reunification.\n\n\"The momentum of China's reunification cannot be stopped by any individuals or forces,\" General Wei Fenghe said during his keynote speech at the ongoing 9th Beijing Xiangshan Forum. \"We will not relinquish a single inch of territory passed down from our forefathers.\"\n\nWei warned the Chinese military will not allow Taiwan secessionists to keep making reckless and desperate moves, nor will it allow foreign forces to interfere in the Taiwan question. \"National reunification is the only rightful path, and pursuing secession is a dead end.\"\n\nWhen discussing China's military-to-military relations, Wei said it is normal for countries to have differences but China will not accept or be intimidated by \"big stick diplomacy\" or \"long arm jurisdiction\", which are ineffective in solving problems.\n\n\"China hopes countries around the world can treat each other with fairness and respect, not bullying the weak or acting condescendingly,\" he said, adding China will never attach any political strings, force nations to take sides, interfere in other countries' domestic affairs or push its agenda onto others.\n\nWei said China-US military-to-military relations, though with its fair share of issues, is still generally stable. He said both countries should enhance cooperation in properly managing risks and tackling common challenges.\n\nIn his speech, Wei also called for a new type of security partnership based on equality, mutual trust and win-win cooperation, given current risks and challenges in the world.\n\nThe 9th Beijing Xiangshan Forum opens in Beijing on Oct 21, 2019.

He stressed China's development will never pose any threat to other countries, and will never seek hegemony, expansion or spheres of influence.\n\nRussian Defense Minister General Sergei Shoigu said at the forum growing China-Russia military relations is a shining example of a type of security partnership based on strategic dialogue, mutual trust and practical cooperation, which has contributed positively to overall bilateral ties, as well as peace and security in the region.\n\nEgypt's Minister of Defense and Military Production General Mohamed Zaki said the forum has allowed militaries around the world to share their experiences, build consensus and jointly enhance cooperation and capability to jointly tackle security issues.", "description": "The Chinese Minister of National Defense said on Monday the Chinese military is resolute in safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, noting China is the only major country still striving for national reunification.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/21/5dad9617a310cf3e97a244d8.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
