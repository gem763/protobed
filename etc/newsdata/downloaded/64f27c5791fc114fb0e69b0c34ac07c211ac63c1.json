This group\u2019s extreme volatility lies in the fact that a single piece of good news like promising study results can cause share prices to climb to new heights, while the reverse also holds true.\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s often difficult to determine if names in this industry represent compelling investments. That being said, there are tools available that can help gauge which biotech stocks are poised for substantial long-term growth.\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy tool, we were able to zero in on 3 biotech stocks that have achieved a \u201cPerfect 10\u201d Smart Score. The metric weighs a variety of factors and combines them into a single numerical score, with 10 being the highest. Not to mention each has earned a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 consensus rating, according to all of the ratings published by analysts in the last three months.\n\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN)\n\nAlexion wants to improve the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), hypophosphatasia (HPP) and other conditions. While best known for its Soliris therapy to treat aHUS, a disease that causes abnormal blood clots to form in small blood vessels in the kidneys, the company has recently expanded its pipeline and has several candidates in development.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, ALXN highlighted its deals with Eidos, Stealth and Achillion as part of its efforts to diversify its offerings. It also expects to add four new clinical stage assets, including two in Phase 3 development. Bearing this in mind, management raised its total revenue guidance to between $4.86 billion to $4.89 billion. If achieved, this would demonstrate an 18% year-over-year gain at the midpoint of the range.\n\nWith all of these promising developments, it\u2019s no wonder that nine analysts have published bullish calls in just the last ten days. One of the analysts singing ALXN\u2019s praises is Citigroup\u2019s Mohit Bansal. He argues that the biotech is a growth stock trading like a value stock. He adds that the \u201cstrong\u201d revenue guidance and recently expanded pipeline may be of interest to incremental investors. As a result, Bansal reiterated his Buy rating.

In just the last three months, ALXN has received 16 Buy ratings and 2 Holds, giving it a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 analyst consensus. Its $155 average price target suggests 48% upside potential.

With the company recently launching studies back in April and May, buzz surrounding this biotech has been building.\n\nThe company recently announced the launch of its registrational Phase 3 study for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2\u2013) metastatic breast cancer. The study of its IMMU-132 drug will feature patients that have experienced failure of at least two but no more than four prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. IMMU also launched a Phase 2 open label study of its sacituzumab govitecan therapy to treat advanced solid tumors.\n\nStory continues", "description": "When it comes to stocks that can shoot up overnight, biotechs are the name of the game.
