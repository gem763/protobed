Ibsen, Grieg of course, and for older popsters maybe Morten Harket of A-ha.\n\nIt turns out that, in his time, none of them could hold a candle to Julius the Chimpanzee. Now 40, the old boy, like many celebrities, has calmed down a bit and is living a contented life as the alpha male, surrounded by admiring women and children, in a protected chimp community in the zoo where he was born on Boxing Day in 1979.\n\nHe can perhaps look back \u2014 for chimpanzees have tremendous memories \u2014 to when he was a colossal national treasure: there were Julius sheets, pillow cases, T-shirts and mugs, best-selling books were written about him, he was a star of children\u2019s TV, he sold his own paintings, he was the subject of hit songs and Julius posters plastered the bedroom walls of countless Norwegian children.\n\nA biography has been written about Julius the Chimp, one of the first to trace the life of an ape. Here he is seen clutching a camera\n\nThousands of people came to see him at Kristiansand zoo in southern Norway. He even met A-ha\u2019s Harket, a noted environmental activist, when the singer and his family came to open a new extension to the zoo in what must have been an extraordinary celebrity mash-up.\n\nNow the story of this remarkable, delightful but often troubled icon has been told \u2014 in the first biography of an ape I can think of \u2014 in this short but thought-provoking book written by an award-winning Norwegian journalist.\n\nWe share 98.6 per cent of our genetic material with chimps: but the other 1.4 per cent must pack a colossal punch because chimps, no matter how cute and lovable, are animals, and we\u2019re not. Well, usually not anyway.\n\nChimps are hugely strong and highly intelligent. They grow up fast and by the age of five they are stronger than most human adults. They can cheat, and feel remorse.\n\nThey are acutely self-aware, too, and are one of the few animals who can recognise themselves in a mirror. They are naturally aggressive and can be destructive and resentful of discipline (sounds like your average teenager).\n\nThe primate was taken in by a human family when he was small, who were keepers at his zoo, Kristiansand in southern Norway. His mother had rejected him at just a few weeks old and another chimp has bitten off his middle finger\n\nChimps have a riotous sex life with mating rituals that make an Ayia Napa stag-do look like Holy Communion. The act itself is fairly brisk \u2014 a tidy seven seconds if you\u2019re interested.\n\nOn the zoo\u2019s 25th anniversary in 1989, Julius\u2019s tenth birthday, Crown Prince Harald came over for a visit, not least to see the chimp. The youngster was given a large helping of bananas and, it was thought, would be up for performing a few tricks for the royal guest.\n\nBut Julius had other plans \u2014 he was keen to cement relations with his latest girlfriend. So after just a few seconds, Prince Harald wandered discreetly off to look for other distractions.\n\nChimps need constant stimulation, but they also love fun and fighting. They can and will bite. Which is why Julius first got noticed. He was only a few weeks old when he was rejected by his mother, Sanne, who was young (just eight) and a complicated lady to boot. Then one of the chimps bit off his finger.\n\nHe was found howling with pain (so human) in a pool of blood and the zoo director Edvard Moseid and vet Billy Glad took him into their homes. There he learnt to play with the human kids, wore a nappy and clothes and was comforted in bed by Moseid\u2019s wife when he had \u2018nightmares\u2019.\n\nThe poor little chimp was raised in a human family and used to sleep in the family bed, being comforted when he had 'nightmares', and wore a nappy and clothes\n\nHe would sit on the sofa watching TV and playing with the Moseid children, an arm around each of them, planting little kisses on their cheeks. No wonder they shared their sweets with him.\n\nHe liked to play \u2018cars\u2019, pushing his drinking bowl around on the floor, and inviting the kids to join him.\n\nThe book is \u00a318.99, and has been published by Greystone books\n\nHe understood the rules of play, and was alert to any of the children trying to gain a march on him in their games of tag.\n\nZoos are commercial operations and the Kristiansand hierarchy knew what a prize asset they had.\n\nA slew of programmes on Norwegian children\u2019s TV followed, propelling Julius to the upper reaches of celebrity.\n\nBut modern zoos are also important centres for animal welfare and research, with an acute awareness of environ- mental responsibility.\n\nAs he got bigger and more boisterous, Julius\u2019s keepers knew that sooner or later they would have to reintegrate him with the other chimps at the zoo.\n\nBut it was not such an easy task \u2014 chimps can be resentful of outsiders and quick to take offence. It was a long, drawn-out process and Julius unsurprisingly became confused: a chimp by day and a human by night.\n\nAs the readjustment to chimp life continued, he was left overnight in a special cage so the fellow chimps could get used to him, too, knowing he was there but unable to knock him about.\n\nHeartbreakingly, when the keepers left him overnight they could hear him crying. He felt abandoned. But ever-resourceful, long-limbed and exceptionally smart, Julius\u2019s determination to escape \u2014 usually clambering up through the roof beams \u2014 would bring a smile of approval to a Colditz veteran. He was thankfully always recaptured. Chimps do love a party and Julius is no exception. There is a splendid account of one of his birthdays: sugar and attention are two of Julius\u2019s favourite things.\n\nWhen he got larger and more boisterous, Julius had to be re-integrated into chimp life. When placed in the cage with other chimps at night, left inside his own cage for his protection, Julius could be heard weeping\n\nHe can show off his party tricks, too: while the other chimps have to bite the top off their bottles of fizzy pop to get a drink, Julius elegantly screws off the cap with his long fingers.\n\nThis fascinating little book touches on central issues of our time, too, but never hectors us.\n\nIn Julius\u2019s lifetime, half the world\u2019s animal populations have been lost.\n\nThe number of wild chimpanzees is in freefall: from one million when he was born, there may now be no more than 200,000.\n\nDo zoos cause abnormal behaviour in animals? Almost certainly, but captive animals may be the only hope for some species in the future, as even the legendary chimp expert Jane Goodall concedes. In the meantime, Julius, enjoy your retirement.", "description": "An autobiography of Julius the Chimpanzee, that was reared with humans and used to share the family bed, has been published.
