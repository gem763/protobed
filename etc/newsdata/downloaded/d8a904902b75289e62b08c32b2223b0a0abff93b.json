Whenever I am traveling, these are my go-tom shoes. Likewise, if I\u2019m going to be spending a day bouncing around meetings in NYC, going from train to subway to walking innumerable city blocks, these are my footwear of choice.\n\nWhy? Because they\u2019re just so damn comfortable.\n\nYou know that break-in period where a pair of shoes feels stiff and rubs at your ankles and just doesn\u2019t cradle the bottom of your foot quite right? There\u2019s none of that here. They felt amazing the first time I pulled them on \u2013 which is quite easy to do thanks to loops at the heel and tongue, by the way \u2013 and after about a half year of wear multiple times each week, they\u2019re still like an extension of my foot.\n\nThe memory foam insole of the Expert Oxford feels like you\u2019re standing barefoot on a yoga mat. Except not quite barefoot, because there\u2019s a soft sock-like lining that gently holds the foot snug, preventing any friction and keeping the shoe secure on your foot.\n\nThe shoe\u2019s outsole has enough tread to give traction even on wet cement or smooth hardwood, yet it\u2019s not an aggressive lug that can be unwieldy on everyday surfaces like concrete or tile. And even with all the wear, the soles have yet to wear down in any appreciable way.\n\nStyle-wise, I\u2019ll wear my Hush Puppies with jeans, khakis, and even some slacks. They\u2019re not a true dress shoe, but they\u2019re a step well above a casual sneaker. And as long as the weather permits wearing long pants, if I have any sort of long outing ahead of me, these are the shoes on my feet. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
