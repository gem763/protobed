His purpose in life is helping other people break free from the chains of their circumstances and live the lives they're destined for.\n\nIf you feel stagnant in your life, or realize that you're not where you want to be, it's easy to feel stuck in your circumstances.\n\nIf you're ready to try something different, it's time to ask yourself some questions. How does your career factor into how you're feeling? How would you ideally be living?\n\nStart with a small first step \u2014 even something like committing to keeping your room clean is a fair start.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nYou blink and all the sudden your life isn't quite where you want it to be.\n\nYou live your life day to day. Your days are more or less the same. It's not like you wake up and terrible things happen (although sometimes you do). You have slight annoyances, little moments where you sigh, and periods of daydreaming about a better future.\n\n\"No big deal,\" you tell yourself. After all, you have plenty of life to live, right? You can always change your situation. Over time, though, you're overcome by the feeling of being stuck.\n\nAyodeji Awosika. Courtesy of Ayodeji Awosika\n\nWhat makes being stuck so difficult to deal with? You didn't get stuck all at once. It happened slowly and subtly. You can't pinpoint one moment or one day where your life started to go in a direction you didn't want it to go in. It sort of, just, happened.\n\nNow you're here. More or less, you have two options for your future. Stay the same or try something different. If you opt for the latter, you can ask yourself great questions to find out what you can do next.\n\nThis is just a blog post. Your life isn't going to magically change after reading it, but it's a good start. Although the post itself might be trivial, the consequences of your action or inaction are definitely not.\n\nThis is your life.\n\nGenuinely ask yourself these questions and see where the answers take you.", "description": "If you feel stuck in your circumstances, it's up to you to make the choice to change.
