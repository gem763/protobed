Well-placed activists and party officials in the state have been so busy juggling other candidates\u2019 trips, some say, that Harris\u2019 absence has, at best, escaped much scrutiny.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the only game in town,\u201d the Democrat added. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s spending time in other early states.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, Harris\u2019 campaign said Iowans are about to see a lot more of her. Campaign manager Juan Rodriguez and communications director Lily Adams said in a call with political reporters they plan to invest significantly more time and resources in Iowa, including adding 60 new paid, full-time organizers and opening up 10 new offices there. Harris is expected to be in the state every week in October.\n\n\u201cAs someone who\u2019s spent a year there for Hillary, I know the state well,\u201d Adams said. \u201cPart of winning the Iowa caucus is making sure you\u2019re there when voters tune in.\u201d\n\nBut some activists in the Hawkeye State caution Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was not worth emulating.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine anything worse than Hillary\u2019s campaign,\u201d a Democratic source directly familiar with both presidential campaigns\u2019 operations said, referencing Clinton\u2019s less than half-point victory over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) after being blindsided in the 2016 Iowa caucus. \u201cThis is worse.\u201d\n\nDespite the new promises, her absence\u201437 days since she last made a trip\u2014has already left a mark with some prominent Iowans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sitting in the political restaurant and we\u2019re not getting service,\u201d Kurt Meyer, chair of the Tri-County Democrats of Iowa, said when asked about the Harris campaign.\n\nHarris was last in Iowa for a five-day, multi-county bus tour in early August, a trip that received the type of fanfare she typically enjoys when entering an early primary state: intrigue and excitement. Democrats from Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina are quick to point out that when Harris shows up, she\u2019s both welcomed and well-liked.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to eat at a place where they\u2019re a little more eager to have my attention,\u201d Meyer, who represents rural Mitchell, Worth, and Howard counties, speculated voters might say as the Feb. 3 caucus grows closer.\n\nIn the past several days, Harris\u2019 campaign has focused part of its online attention planning for and promoting her upcoming trip in a round of fundraising emails, hoping to cash in on the momentum ahead of the September 20 federal fundraising deadline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back on the trail in Iowa, first in Coralville and Cedar Rapids; then, Waterloo, Cedar Falls, and Des Moines through the weekend,\u201d Harris\u2019 email reads. \u201cWhat we do right now will be the difference in this election.\u201d\n\nMuch of her summer has focused on fundraising more broadly. Just days before her Iowa bonanza, Harris hit up a swing of fundraisers in New York, hoping to score the kind of donations that can help restore her campaign\u2019s earlier promise for success in the primary. Harris, who was not up for re-election in 2018, spent much of the midterm cycle campaigning and raising money for down-ballot Democrats, as opposed to her own Senate campaign, a point her campaign notes when asked about her heavier reliance on fundraisers than some other candidates.\n\nDuring the Democratic primary, Harris received bursts of early momentum, first after launching her campaign in January with a roughly 20,000-person crowd in her home city of Oakland and followed by a post-debate boom after landing an attack on former Vice President Joe Biden in Miami. But those have shown visible signs of fizzling in Iowa, multiple unbound Democrats in the state said.\n\n\u201cA [37-day] void right now gets in the dangerous window,\u201d John Norris, a longtime political operative, said.\n\nStill, party strategists and activists aren\u2019t ready to write off Harris just yet. Indeed, the direction of her campaign, according to interviews with multiple county party officials and seasoned operatives, depends largely on how effectively she\u2019s able to make up for the recent success of rivals. Biden remains the polling frontrunner and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is widely considered to have built up the strongest grassroots organization in the state.\n\nDespite fresh promises to focus more on organizing and retail politics five months before the first caucus, Harris\u2019 infrequent trips and limited outreach thus far, from major metropolitan areas to rural areas of the state, several sources said, may indicate she\u2019s already lost ground to her Democratic rivals who have become mainstays in the state.\n\n\u201cKamala\u2019s not here but Pete Buttigieg is,\u201d one unaffiliated Democratic official said. \u201cWhen you look at it like that, it wasn\u2019t the type of race they were going to be able to put their heart and soul in Iowa.\u201d\n\nA new poll released by Focus on Rural America, which was conducted by her own pollster, helps bolster that perception. Harris dropped 13 points since July, earning just 5 percent\u2014or in sixth place\u2014well behind Biden\u2019s 25 percent lead. In Real Clear Politics\u2019 Iowa polling average, Harris hovers around 8.5 percent, behind Biden at 28.5 percent, Warren at 18 percent, and Sanders at 17.5 percent. Together, the results help paint a broader mosaic of her campaign\u2019s mixed signals in the first caucus state, despite picking up some notable endorsements, including Sue Dvorsky, the former Iowa Democratic Party chairwoman, and Bob Dvorsky, a former state senator.\n\nOn Thursday, Harris is scheduled to host a meet and greet in Coralville and a town hall in Cedar Rapids. On Friday, she will participate in a town hall in Waterloo, a campus event in Cedar Falls at the University of Northern Iowa, and the LGBTQ Presidential Candidate Forum at Coe College in Cedar Rapids.\n\nBut sure to be the most publicized event will be on Saturday, where Harris will be just one of 18 2020 Democratic contenders for the season\u2019s marquee Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines. She purchased the third most tickets for the event, next to Biden and Buttigieg, a source familiar with the process said, which guarantees she\u2019ll have a sizable presence alongside her. On her way, her campaign announced she\u2019ll march alongside McDonalds workers calling for a $15 per hour minimum wage.\n\nCampaign officials on the briefing call pointed to a \u201ctop three finish\u201d in Iowa and stressed that their increased investment in resources and physical presence is helping lead up to that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve cracked the code on how to generate the sense that they are a major player in the Hawkeye State,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not too early to say there are some concerns.\u201d\n\nBeyond Iowa, some Democratic strategists cautioned her early stumbles there have already started to cripple her efforts in other states with significant importance in the early calendar.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign said it plans to spend an increased investment in South Carolina, the first-in-the-South primary with a significant population of African-American voters. And while Harris is expected to return on Sept. 21, where she\u2019s scheduled to speak to the local NAACP chapter in Charleston, among other events for her 10th trip to the state as a presidential contender, she hasn\u2019t been there in over 70 days and has suffered in state polls.\n\n\u201cHer campaign\u2019s on early life support,\u201d one Democratic operative unattached to any campaign in the Palmetto State said. \u201cThe problem with her in South Carolina is that some of the other things in other places is bleeding down to the momentum.\u201d", "description": "Absence hasn\u2019t necessarily made the heart of Iowa activists grow fonder for Sen.
