Prograis obliged Taylor to counter his technical brilliance with strength of will, relentless effort and raw courage.\n\nJoshua and Fury had been the giant twin faces of prize-fighting in this country in recent seasons with their heavyweight exploits.\n\nAJ will become so again if he recovers his world titles in the December 7 rematch in Saudi Arabia against Andy Ruiz Jr, the rotund Mexican who inflicted upon him in the upset of the century this summer.\n\nTaylor's decision win over Prograis saw him add the American's WBA title to his IBF belt\n\nThe Gypsy King will also overhaul Taylor in terms of public esteem if he improves next February on his epic if controversial draw with WBC world champion Deontay Wilder last December,.\n\nBut for the moment at least, Edinburgh's brave-heart may take pleasure from reading my list herewith of Britain's current top ten:\n\n1) Josh Taylor* 2) Tyson Fury** 3) Josh Warrington* 4) Anthony Joshua 5) Callum Smith* 6) Billy Joe Saunders* 7) Kal Kafai* 8) Amir Khan 9) Kell Brook 10) Chris Eubank Jr***.\n\n*WBC, WBA, IBF or WBO world champions\n\n**lineal world champion\n\n***IBO world title", "description": "JEFF POWELL: Josh Taylor's majority decision over Regis Prograis in a potential Fight of the Year at London's 02 has made him the pre-eminent star of the British ring.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/23/20228540-0-image-a-84_1572304206805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
