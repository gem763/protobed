The intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson and Volker have already testified in closed-door sessions to the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs Committees. The panels have also issued subpoenas to the White House, Giuliani, and Secretary of State and Mike Pompeo, among others.\n\nOn October 6, the attorneys representing the first intelligence community whistleblower announced they are also representing a second intelligence official who wants to come forward, and who has firsthand knowledge of Trump's alleged misconduct connected to Ukraine.\n\nReuters\n\nThe pressure came from the very top. Trump has long been fixated on the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 race and did so in order to help the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe also believes the Obama administration \u2014 Biden specifically \u2014 strongarmed the Ukrainian government to oust its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company whose board Biden's son sat on until recently.\n\nDespite Trump's allegations, there's no evidence that the Bidens engaged in wrongdoing. That's been confirmed by both US and Ukrainian government officials.\n\nTrump pressed the Ukrainian president to work with Giuliani to investigate the Bidens eight times during their phone call. He'd ordered the US to withhold security assistance just days before that conversation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in early October, Trump doubled down in calling for Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son and added that China should do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nREUTERS/Gleb Garanich\n\nZelensky, a former comedian and TV star, was elected as Ukraine's president in April after he ran on an anticorruption platform.\n\nTrump pressured Zelensky to probe both CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm retained by the DNC to investigate Russia's hack of its servers in 2016, and the Bidens during his July phone call.\n\nUkraine is heavily reliant on US military aid in its fight with Russian-backed militants.\n\nZelensky has tried to distance himself from the ongoing controversy engulfing at the White House.\n\nAt the United Nations General Assembly meeting in late September, Zelensky denied that he felt pressure from Trump to investigate the Bidens, and emphasized that he did not want to be involved in American elections.\n\nRead more: Meet Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's comedian turned president who's at the center of the scandal threatening Trump's presidency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAs former President Barack Obama's top deputy, Biden served as the administration's point-person for US-Ukraine policy and relationships.\n\nWhen he called for Shokin to be fired, Biden represented the US's official position on the matter, one that was shared by many other Western governments and anticorruption activists in Ukraine, according to The Associated Press.\n\nHowever, Trump and Giuliani allege that Biden pushed for Shokin's ouster because he wanted to stymie the investigation into Burisma.\n\nBut there's a loophole in those claims. Government officials and Ukrainian anticorruption advocates say Shokin had hampered the investigation into Burisma long before Biden even stepped into the picture, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBiden has called Trump's push to have him investigated by a foreign power disturbing and said it shows Trump is unfit for office.\n\nRead more: Trump brought up Joe Biden during a June phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHunter Biden\n\nPaul Morigi/Getty Images for World Food Program USA\n\nHunter Biden, Joe Biden's eldest son, served on the board of Ukrainian oil and gas company Bursima Holdings from 2014 to 2019 providing legal advice and receiving a reported salary of around $50,000 a month.\n\nBurisma was the subject of an investigation from the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office into whether its founder Mykola Zlochevsky engaged in tax evasion, money laundering, and corruption.\n\nWhen former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin assumed the role in 2015, the investigation into Burisma was largely dormant, and there is no evidence that Hunter was personally involved in any wrongdoing.\n\nRead more: A Ukraine gas company tied to Joe Biden's son is at the center of the Trump-whistleblower scandal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer\n\nShannon Stapleton/Reuters\n\nGiuliani is Trump's personal lawyer and not a government official. He has functioned largely as Trump's key envoy in the Ukraine controversy, and he used his connections to Trump and other US government officials to push Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint said \u2014 and Giuliani has acknowledged \u2014 that Trump and State Department officials enlisted him to work with the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.\n\nGiuliani was mentioned 31 times in the complaint and described as a \"central figure\" in the administration's efforts to encourage Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, which included serving as an \"envoy\" on the matter and meeting with an aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak.\n\nGiuliani, meanwhile, has defended himself by saying he only got involved because Volker asked him to.\n\nRead more: How Rudy Giuliani went from a respected federal prosecutor and beloved NYC mayor to Trump's bag man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman\n\nAram Roston/Reuters\n\nParnas and Fruman, two of Giuliani's business associates, who allegedly helped him dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden have been arrested and charged with violating campaign finance laws, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are Soviet-born and were under investigation by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. They are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later today, the report said.\n\nIt's not yet clear what the charges against them entail and what they are specifically accused of doing. The Journal reported that both Parnas and Fruman have donated to Republican campaigns and gave $325,000 to the main pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, in May 2018 through a company called Global Energy Producers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVice President Mike Pence\n\nPAUL FAITH/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPence wasn't a party to the call, but has still been roped into the Ukraine saga.\n\nTrump used Pence to convey to Zelensky that the US would withhold military aid to the country while demanding that it aggressively investigate corruption, the Washington Post reported.\n\nThe Ukrainian government officials understood that Trump's demand to investigate corruption was connected to his desire for them to look into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son ahead of the 2020 election, the Post said.\n\nTrump's direction to Pence came shortly after his July 25 phone call with Zelensky.\n\nPence addressed the issue of corruption in Ukraine during a diplomatic trip to Poland in August, before the public learned of the whistleblower's complaint and after it was reported that the US was withholding aid from Ukraine.\n\nThe day after he met with Zelensky during the trip, Pence was asked about the substance of their conversation. He said they did not discuss Biden but said Trump had asked him to convey to Zelensky that the US has \"great concerns about issues of corruption.\"\n\nPence said that before investing more taxpayer money in Ukraine, \"the president wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine, and that's an expectation the American people have and the president has expressed very clearly.\"\n\nPence received a transcript of the phone call before his diplomatic trip, but officials close to him said he did not review it closely and had no knowledge that Trump brought up the Bidens during the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo\n\nAP/Andrew Harnik\n\nPompeo, Trump's former CIA director, is his most trusted official on foreign policy matters.\n\nAfter initially denying that he had knowledge of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, Pompeo later admitted to being a party to the conversation.\n\nIn addition to misrepresenting his involvement in the Trump-Zelensky call, Pompeo is also accused of obstructing the congressional investigation into the matter.\n\nIn September, Pompeo sent a letter to the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight committees, telling them their requests to depose department officials connected to the whistleblower's complaint are \"not feasible\" and \"do not provide adequate time for the Department and its employees to prepare\" for testimony.\n\nIn turn, Democratic lawmakers accused Pompeo of \"intimidating Department witnesses\" from testifying and warned that it \"will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nPompeo has dismissed the impeachment inquiry as a \"silly gotcha game,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"When I talk to your foreign minister he pressures me all the time,\" Pompeo said to a Greek reporter in Athens. \"It is totally appropriate. Nations do this. Nations work together. They say 'Boy, goodness gracious if you can help me with X, we'll help you achieve Y.' This is what partnerships do.

The report said it was not Barr's first trip to Italy to meet with intelligence officials.\n\nBarr also reportedly called Trump and encouraged him to tell Rudy Giuliani to tone down his wild TV appearances, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRead more: 'Pure insanity': Intelligence veterans are floored by Barr's 'off the books' overtures to foreign officials about the Russia probe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone\n\nThe Washington Post/ Getty\n\nAs Trump's White House counsel, Cipollone is leading the fight against the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry \u2014 and has told House Democrats that he refuses to participate in their inquiry.\n\nHe recently sent an explosive letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the chairmen of the three House committees spearheading the investigation that Trump and his administration would not cooperate with the investigation because the administration viewed it as \"partisan and unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,\" the letter said.\n\nRead more: White House says Trump 'cannot permit his administration' to cooperate with the 'partisan and unconstitutional' impeachment inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRick Perry\n\nAssociated Press\n\nThe president also implicated US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in the Ukraine saga, claiming recently that Perry had encouraged him to call Zelensky regarding Burisma.\n\n\"Not a lot of people know this but, I didn't even want to make the call,\" Trump said on a call with House Republicans, a source familiar with the comments told Axios. \"The only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant.\"\n\nFollowing Axios' report, Perry acknowledged that he \"absolutely\" encouraged the president to call Zelensky \"multiple times,\" but not about the Bidens.\n\nRead more: Trump is reportedly blaming Rick Perry for his infamous call with the Ukrainian president\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, chair of the House Select Permanent Committee on Intelligence\n\nReuters\n\nSchiff, an experienced committee chair and ranking member, is taking the lead on the impeachment inquiry, calling witnesses and subpoenaing documents as part of the investigation.\n\nSo far, his committee has heard testimony from Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and closed-door testimony from Volker and Atkinson.\n\nThe intelligence committee has also issued subpoenas to Giuliani and Pompeo.\n\nIt recently surfaced that the whistleblower approached a committee aide with their concerns about the call before filing an official complaint. The whistleblower gave the aide a \"vague\" account of their allegations, The New York Times reported, and the aide followed committee rules and advised the whistleblower to hire a lawyer and file an official complaint.\n\nRead more: 2 key facts refute Trump's conspiracy theories about the Ukraine scandal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker\n\nPavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nVolker worked in an unpaid, volunteer capacity as the US' Special Representative to Ukraine. But he got more than he bargained for when he was swept up in the Ukraine scandal after being named in the whistleblower's complaint.\n\nAccording to text messages turned over to Congress, Volker played an active role in setting up communications and meetings between Giuliani and Yermak, Zelensky's aide.\n\nIn written testimony submitted to the House Intelligence Committee, Volker emphasized that \"at no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden.\"\n\nBut the text messages paint a different picture and show Volker was aware of Trump's intentions from the get-go and did not raise any concerns about the matter.\n\n\"Heard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump (sic) he will investigate/'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\" Volker wrote in an August 30 text message to fellow diplomat Bil Taylor, seemingly implying that a meeting between Zelensky and Trump would be contingent on investigations.\n\nVolker has since resigned from his position as Special Envoy to Ukraine and from the McCain Institute.\n\nRead more: Newly revealed text messages show Trump diplomats' internal turmoil over his pressure on Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Taylor, Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires at the US Embassy in Ukraine\n\nReuters/Gleb Garanich\n\nBill Taylor, a career diplomat, served as the US ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush's administration from 2006 to 2009, and was appointed as the charg\u00e9 d'affaires for the US embassy in Ukraine earlier this year.\n\nIn the text messages submitted to Congress, Taylor repeatedly raised concerns that Trump was leveraging a meeting with Zelensky and military aid in exchange for \"investigations.\"\n\nAfter Trump canceled a planned visit to Warsaw, Poland, on August 30, where he was set to meet with Zelensky, Taylor \"sought clarification\" on the conditions for the Ukrainian president to visit the White House the next day.\n\n\"Are we now saying that security assistance and [White House] meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Taylor wrote to Sondland in a September 1, exchange.\n\nIn another exchange on September 9, Taylor wrote to Sondland saying that Trump halting military aid to Ukraine has \"shaken their faith in us,\" which he said was his \"nightmare scenario.\"\n\nTaylor later added that he thought that Trump's decision to \"withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign\" is \"crazy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\n\nDANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSondland made a fortune as a successful hotel executive and entrepreneur in the Pacific Northwest and became a generous donor to Republican politicians \u2014 which included giving $1 million to Trump's 2017 inaugural fund.\n\nIn 2018, Trump nominated Sondland to be the US' ambassador to the European Union.\n\nGiuliani, Volker, and Sondland all exchanged messages regarding Giuliani's communications with Ukranian officials.\n\nIn one exchange that took place on July 21, Taylor texted Sondland saying Zelensky was \"sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\"\n\nSondland replied: \"Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.\"\n\nAfter Taylor expressed concern in a September 1 exchange that withholding the funds in exchange for an investigation was \"crazy,\" Sondland responded, \"the president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind.\"\n\n\"The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign,\" Sondland added.\n\nRead more: Meet the latest actor in the whirlwind Ukraine inquiry: hotelier turned ambassador Gordon Sondland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer US ambassador to Ukraine Masha Yovanovitch\n\nAP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky\n\nMasha Yovanovitch, a veteran diplomat who worked in the US Foreign Service for over three decades, served as the US ambassador to Ukraine from 2016 to May of 2019.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump pushed her out of the administration when people close to him \u2014 particularly Giuliani \u2014 lamented that she displayed an \"anti-Trump bias\" and got in the way of his efforts to persuade the Ukranian government to open the investigations Trump wanted them to pursue.\n\nNow, Yovanovitch is poised to become a key witness in the House's impeachment inquiry.

He appeared in open session before the House Intelligence Committee on September 26. Maguire said he contacted the White House because the president was the subject of the complaint and that it could therefore raise issues of executive privilege.\n\nThe White House and Justice Department advised Maguire to withhold the document from Congress, prompting a showdown with Schiff's committee before Maguire eventually forwarded the complaint to lawmakers.\n\nIn his opening statement at his hearing, Maguire said, \"I want to stress I believe the whistle-blower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout.
