They would be required to contribute $3 billion and possibly more, depending on the sale price of Mundipharma, their international drug company, over seven years.\n\nBut they would still retain much of their wealth. In fact, they might be able to keep billions of dollars that state attorneys general allege they pulled out of the company.\n\n\u201cNo one is going to be happy after this,\u201d said Adam J. Levitin, a Georgetown Law School professor who studies bankruptcy. \u201cPeople are going to be mad that the Sacklers aren\u2019t going to jail, that they will have money left.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reviewed a detailed analysis of the settlement plan that has been valued at $10 billion to $12 billion. The plan has been at the heart of negotiations among the parties for many months. The material was confirmed by three people close to the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.\n\nIf no deal is reached, Purdue is likely to declare bankruptcy in coming weeks, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s strategy. A huge civil trial against Purdue and as many as two dozen drug companies is scheduled to begin in Cleveland on Oct. 21.\n\nThe assumptions that undergird the $12 billion figure reveal why some of the plaintiffs are uncomfortable with aspects of the deal and why some have pledged flatly to oppose it. Some plaintiffs do not trust the valuations provided by Purdue and the Sacklers.\n\nBut the documents also indicate that if settlement talks fail and the Sacklers vote to send Purdue into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the plaintiffs might get as little as $1.2 billion from an auction of the business\u2019s components.\n\nIn that scenario, plaintiffs would probably have to jockey for rights to Purdue\u2019s assets. The process could generate enormous legal bills, possibly further reducing any payout to them.\n\nPurdue appears to be betting that this reality, coupled with continued pressure for a settlement from U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster, who oversees the case, will push the agreement over the finish line. But attorneys general in Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey are balking.\n\nConnecticut Attorney General William Tong declined in a written statement to comment on the proposed agreement but said Purdue should be \u201cbroken up and shut down,\u201d its assets liquidated and the Sacklers forced to pay.\n\n\u201cConnecticut demands that the Sacklers and Purdue management be forced completely out of the opioid business, domestically and internationally, and that they never be allowed to return,\u2019\u2019 Tong said.\n\nThe Post sought comment on the proposed settlement from plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, a Purdue spokeswoman and representatives of the three branches of the Sackler family. All declined to comment or did not return emails and phone calls requesting comment. Polster has imposed a gag order on all parties in the negotiation under his jurisdiction.\n\nPurdue reiterated its position in a statement issued Saturday morning. \u201cPurdue Pharma believes a settlement that benefits the American public now is a far better path than years of wasteful litigation and appeals,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile the company is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, Purdue has made clear that it prefers a constructive global resolution. We are actively working with state attorneys general and other plaintiffs on solutions that have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives and deliver billions of dollars to the communities affected by the opioid abuse crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Post also contacted several state attorneys general who were said to be involved in an Aug. 20 meeting with Polster to discuss a settlement. Other than Tong, who released a statement, none would publicly discuss the matter.\n\nMore than 40 states have sued Purdue or other drug companies in their own courts. But the company has said it wants any deal to cover those lawsuits as well as the consolidated federal case so that it will no longer face litigation.\n\nPublic resentment of Purdue and the Sacklers has smoldered in recent years. In 2007, the company and three of its executives pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges of misleading doctors and the public about the safety and effectiveness of its drugs. They paid a $635 million fine but served no jail time.\n\nThis year, public demonstrations of outrage erupted after Massachusetts and other states released internal emails in legal documents that depicted former president Richard Sackler\u2019s and Purdue\u2019s effort to drive up profits by persuading doctors to prescribe OxyContin to more people, more often and in higher doses.\n\nMassachusetts produced records of Purdue board meetings where the Sacklers voted to move hundreds of millions of dollars from Purdue. Between 2008 and 2016, the family paid itself more than $4.3 billion, the lawsuit claimed. On Friday, Oregon\u2019s attorney general, Ellen Rosenblum, said the family had taken $11 billion out of the company.\n\nIn their own court filing, the Sacklers said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey\u2019s lawsuit contained \u201cmisleading and inflammatory allegations\u201d and took company emails out of context in assigning blame for the epidemic to the Sacklers. They asked a state court to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nNow, as the trial date approaches and Polster ratchets up pressure to settle, negotiations are intensifying. They became public Tuesday, when NBC News first revealed the outline of the deal.\n\nThe analysis reviewed by The Post offers previously undisclosed information about the proposed settlement.\n\nIts most novel idea is to send the company to bankruptcy court with a prospective agreement, which would encourage a bankruptcy judge to temporarily halt the lawsuits. Then Purdue would be resurrected as a for-profit trust that would be under the control of trustees appointed by the judge.\n\nThe trust would produce and provide addiction and overdose medications, which are still in the pipeline, free of charge. But to calculate their value for the agreement, the analysis estimates their worth at $4.4 billion over 10 years. The bulk of that is derived from two drugs.\n\nNearly $2.2 billion is assigned to the nine years worth of nalmefene, an older drug that Purdue is developing for first responders as an antidote to overdoses of the powerful street drug fentanyl.\n\nThe value is not based on a potential market price of the drug, however. It was calculated by comparing its potential lifesaving effects to naloxone, a weaker nasal spray for overdoses that is in wide use, according to documents and the people familiar with the proposal.\n\nIn instances when medical personnel now need to use multiple doses of naloxone \u2014 for example when fentanyl is involved \u2014 the cost per emergency response can run up to $300. That figure was used as a comparison for the cost of a nalmefene treatment.\n\nNalmefene\u2019s potential advantages have not been proved in actual clinical trials, which began this summer. The Food and Drug Administration has fast-tracked a review of the drug, but the agency has not approved it for use.\n\nA second drug \u2014 an over-the- counter version of naloxone nasal spray, which accounts for $1.9 billion of the settlement \u2014 also lacks FDA approval, according to the documents reviewed by The Post. The Purdue nasal spray would be given away free, without a prescription. The proposed settlement puts a value on that drug by assuming average sales of more than $200 million a year.\n\nAny new drug would face competition from the only naloxone drug available, Narcan. Other companies are also working on generic competitors.\n\nIronically, the new public trust would largely pay for the millions of doses of the antidote drugs by continuing to sell OxyContin to pain patients, according to the documents.\n\nPurdue holds patents for \u00adtamper-resistant versions of the 25-year-old drug, which generated $790 million in revenue last year, according to the documents. But those patents will run out over the 10-year settlement, drastically cutting revenue and therefore the money available to combat the drug epidemic.\n\nWithin 10 years, the annual revenue from OxyContin would shrivel to just tens of millions of dollars annually, according to the documents reviewed by The Post.\n\nPurdue hopes to plug that growing gap with new drugs, including one approved by the FDA this year, Adhancia, which treats attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the documents show.\n\nThe plaintiffs also would net relatively little from Purdue\u2019s existing balance sheet. Although OxyContin has generated an estimated $35 billion in revenue since it hit the market, Purdue had $500 million cash on hand earlier this year, according to the documents.\n\nThe company\u2019s single biggest current asset appears to be a collection of insurance policies, which could be worth $725 million, according to the documents. But two individuals familiar with the negotiations said the actual value of those policies could be hundreds of millions of dollars less after negotiations with insurance companies.\n\nThe settlement estimates that the new public benefit trust would continue to make money, ending the 10 years with perhaps $800 million in the bank. Further, it estimates that the value of the company\u2019s production facilities, patents and other residual assets would total an additional $800 million.\n\nThe document did not give a full breakdown of the company\u2019s current assets, however, including a drug manufacturing facility in North Carolina.\n\nCritics question the proposed benefits.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe the company is worth what the family and Purdue says it is, and we do not believe the rescue drugs are worth anywhere close to what they project. I mean, they haven\u2019t even been approved by the FDA yet,\u201d said one person familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of Polster\u2019s admonition not to discuss them.\n\nPlaintiffs have moved off an initial position that the Sackler family should kick in $6 billion, but the family, the individual said, has been reluctant to commit to more than $3 billion.\n\n\u201cThe family knew $3 billion was the price of admission for a conversation about a settlement and they have been unwilling to move beyond that,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing.\u201d\n\nDavid Herzberg, a University of Buffalo history professor who has researched the marketing of opioids, suggested another approach. \u201cWhy not take that idea, and use their money to build another organization that isn\u2019t already tainted, already steeped in all the worst possible elements of for-profit pharma?\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBut some attorneys general support the deal, preferring a bird-in-the-hand approach to bankruptcy without a deal or litigation.\n\nAs for the Sackler family itself, the current proposal demands they pay $500 million in the first year of the deal, $300 million annually in years two through six and $1 billion in the seventh year, for a total of $3 billion, according to one person familiar with the deal.\n\nThey could do that by selling off their international drug conglomerate, Mundipharma, or reaching into the trusts and investments where much of their money has been reported to be located. The Sacklers\u2019 wealth has been valued at $13.5 billion by Bloomberg News, which would make them one of the richest families in the United States.\n\nAt one point, Mundipharma\u2019s website said the company was valued at $7 billion. Whether the company could fetch even half that now, and how quickly it could be sold off, are central issues in the negotiations. According to one person close to the negotiations, the family has expressed confidence in negotiations that it could get at least $3 billion from the sale.\n\nIf Mundipharma sells for more than that, 90 percent of the next $1.5 billion would go to plaintiffs, according to people close to the negotiations. If the sale price is higher than $4.5 billion, the plaintiffs and the family would split the rest of the proceeds equally.\n\nThat could leave untouched the family\u2019s fortune in trusts, limited liability corporations, and investment funds that control extensive stock holdings, real estate and even ski resorts.\n\nBut the conglomerate\u2019s value could be reduced by concerns that it, too, could be scrutinized over its opioid promotion practices.\n\nRead more\n\nDrugmakers showered the country with 76 billion opioid pills in seven years\n\nJudge orders Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million in landmark opioid case\n\nThe most complex civil trial in U.S. history will start with these Ohio counties", "description": "But the agreement would offer cities and states urgently needed cash and addiction medicines to address the opioid crisis.", "authors": ["Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health", "Aaron C.
