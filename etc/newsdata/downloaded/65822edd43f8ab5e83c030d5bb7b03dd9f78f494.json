There have always been the various LEGO games, and this summer saw the release of a Stranger Things game to coincide with the release of its third season. Still to come is Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, a game adaptation of the Netflix series and a John Wick game from Mike Bithell. Nonetheless, for an industry that once ran on licensed games, in recent times there has been a dearth of licensed titles from big AAA studios and publishers.\n\nFor indie or work-for-hire developers, there\u2019s a clear incentive to work on a licensed game: you\u2019re guaranteed an audience. But those same economics don\u2019t necessarily make much sense for AAA studios. During Develop, I mentioned this to Bithell, who said \u201cif you're a AAA publisher, there's a very strong argument that you should be spending your resources creating your own IP, that you get to own, and you get to sell merchandise of. Maybe Hollywood makes a movie spin-off one day!\u201d\n\nGiven how lengthy and expensive the top end of game development is, you need to be talking about a huge IP that\u2019s a worthwhile long-term investment to bet the farm on. But then they surely don\u2019t get bigger than Marvel\u2019s Avengers, with Avengers: Endgame being the highest-grossing movie worldwide of all time. If AAA is going to go big on an established IP, then this one is surely a banker.\n\nOr one would think so, at least. The gamble didn\u2019t appear to pay off when Avengers got its official unveiling at E3, with most of the criticism levelled at the look of the Avengers themselves. Rather than the comic book aesthetic of Ultimate Alliance 3, the game goes for grounded photorealism but, without the right to use likenesses of the MCU actors, there\u2019s no escaping that any direct comparison laves the characters looking like pale imitations.\n\nBut visuals can be deceptive and when I finally got a hands-on taste of the game, my impressions improved, though I'm not quite ready to board the hype train. Mainly because the demo I got to play is just the opening tutorial mission, which gives a taste of the powers of the five core playable Avengers: Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Black Widow.\n\nOn the positive side, each hero plays with their own distinct style. Thor especially feels great wielding Mjolnir around, which works for smacking enemies up-close or being flung in ranged attacks - and just like Kratos\u2019s Leviathan Axe, there's a satisfying 'smack' as it's recalled and flies back to your hand.\n\nIron Man\u2019s flying and ranged attacks immediately remind me of Anthem, for better or worse. Hulk smashes (duh) but is also surprisingly agile when it comes to wall-jumping from obstacles. Cap\u2019s vibranium shield is a highlight, great for defending against attacks but also for frisbeeing foes from all sides.\n\nAs the hero without flashy super powers Black Widow might have gotten the short straw, but more than makes do with CQC and dual pistols as a somewhat more badass Lara Croft (perfect sense for co-developer Crystal Dynamics).\n\nEven if the combat feels good, however, this linear tutorial's scripted banter and regular QTEs doesn't convincingly showcase how Avengers will play as a whole. Not to mention that when you\u2019re these supreme heroes (come on, Thor is literally a god), using the full force of superpowers like Iron Man\u2019s repulsor beam on humans (albeit heavily armoured humans) isn\u2019t just ridiculously one-sided, but feels slightly un-Avenger-y?\n\nThere are videos of the gameplay, so by all means make up your own mind.\n\nMore interesting then is trying to figure out what the actual meat of the game is and the long-term ambition publisher Square Enix and the developers have for it. Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos laid out exactly this in a media presentation after my hands-on.\n\nAmos began by addressing the initial backlash to the Avengers looking like B-movie copies of their MCU counterparts, saying that the game is meant to be an original version of the heroes and take them in a new direction from what's been done. Crystal Dynamics obviously managed this with the rebooted Tomb Raider, so at least it has a track record here.\n\nThe opening mission sees the Avengers out to save San Francisco from destruction, and ultimately failing, which leads to their disbandment and superheroes outlawed worldwide. Then the campaign has you slowly reassembling the Avengers five years later, with the story's core being not just saving the world but the Avengers themselves. I suppose that when the big screen version has ended on an epic battle spanning the universe and time, something more introspective is probably the way to go.\n\nAs for who you\u2019ll be fighting against, it seems like basic human enemies are limited to that tutorial mission. But while a couple supervillains have been mentioned, including Taskmaster and Abomination, the key antagonist in Avengers is an organisation that come to power in the absence of our heroes, Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM).\n\nDescribed as a technocratic organisation that wants to redefine mankind\u2019s future through reason and logic, AIM not only rebuilds San Francisco but replaces superheroes by building and mobilising its own powerful \u201csynthoid AI force\u201d - and you can guess where this is going.\n\nWe haven\u2019t yet seen any art of what they\u2019ll look like but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the majority of the enemies you encounter are essentially AIM bots of various classes, which is sounding only marginally less appealing than the generic thugs you fight in Spider-Man. For reference, here\u2019s how they look in the comics:\n\nSo how will the rest of the game play? Fortunately it\u2019s not going to be as linear as the tutorial mission, but there will be single-player specific Hero missions, focused on and tailored to a specific hero, while War Zones let you play as any hero in solo or online co-op with up to three other players.\n\nThe latter also vary in outcomes, so it might be story-specific or for hunting out specific gear or outfits. These also sound more expansive because ultimately, they not only have to support up to four players but also feel fun to play whichever type of superhero you\u2019re playing as.\n\nThese missions take place across the globe, which here is composed of rather expansive mission-specific locales that you\u2019re deployed to from the war table at your base of operations a la Destiny.\n\nThat\u2019s actually the first of many comparisons to Bungie\u2019s online shooter. There\u2019s all the gear you find when playing missions, which grants different perks, and in the UI I got a glance at familiar colour-coding for common, rare, and legendary gear, with the rarest offering multiple perks. Thankfully these loot drops are also specific to the hero you\u2019re playing, so if you\u2019re Iron Man then you\u2019ll only receive Iron Man gear.\n\nThere\u2019s also branded sets, such as Stark Industries gear, which sounds a little Monster Hunter to me in that if you have a complete matching set of gear you\u2019ll be granted extra incentives and boosts, and no doubt that will involve grinding certain missions to get them.\n\nAs well as gear there are costumes, and you\u2019ll be able to kit your heroes out with a wide array of outfits spanning Marvel\u2019s rich 80-year history: so, a lot of spandex. There are two important points here: firstly, the costumes are purely cosmetic and, secondly, some are unlocked by playing certain missions but others will only be available to purchase as DLC.\n\nThe good news, I suppose, is that there are no loot boxes so you\u2019ll be able to pay for exactly what you want. But you\u2019re also talking 80 years worth of Marvel costumes, which could in theory mean anyone who wants every single costume will be forking out big-time (for comparison, Dead or Alive 5: Last Round\u2019s costumes reportedly add up to about a grand).\n\nWhile you might have to pay for costumes, however, apparently the long-term \u2018endgame\u2019 of Avengers is that you won\u2019t have to pay for future updates. That includes things like new heroes, new areas, and new missions. The heroes specifically aren\u2019t just like a new class or character in a fighting game but come with their own storylines, skill trees, gear, and costumes.\n\nAmos claims that these updates are planned \u201cfor years to come - this is just the beginning of an epic adventure.\u201d\n\nAnother multiple title franchise like Tomb Raider I can imagine, or maybe season passes like Destiny, sure. But an ever-evolving game that you just buy at launch then be rewarded with tons more playable content down the line without paying another penny? Who knows, maybe costume DLC can fund future development, but this sounds a little too good to be true.\n\nThe other concern is that, when Avengers launches on May 15, 2020, it\u2019s going to be at the end of this console generation, and the month afterwards will see E3 and the industry presumably gearing up for the next-gen. It\u2019s less an issue if you\u2019re playing on PC or Stadia, which the game has also been recently confirmed for, but it does feel like a project this ambitious and long-term may be arriving at the long time.\n\nCrystal Dynamics clearly has the talent to create polished AAA blockbusters, and I'm sure Avengers will hit a certain quality bar. A quick look at the roll-call of talent assembled for this project inspires confidence: director Shaun Escayg (ex-Naughty Dog), director of production Stephen Barry (ex-Visceral, EA), and combat designer Vince Napoli (God of War). And despite those uncomfortable MCU comparisons, maybe the studio will reimagine the Avengers as effectively as they reimagined Lara Croft.\n\nFor publisher Square Enix it\u2019s still a big gamble. Investing so heavily in someone else\u2019s IP is anything but a sure thing, though maybe it\u2019s just the next logical step in the company\u2019s long partnership with Disney - what better way to follow up than with the Mouse House\u2019s most profitable IP? After all, if Avengers pulls in even a fraction of the cinematic audience, who\u2019s going to care what their faces look like.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Kotaku UK, bringing you original reporting, game culture and humour from the British isles.", "description": "It\u2019s not that there haven\u2019t been any licensed games in the last decade or so.
