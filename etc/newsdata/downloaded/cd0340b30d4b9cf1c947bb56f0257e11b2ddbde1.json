But with the new season of Vince Gilligan\u2019s companion series Better Call Saul upon us, we\u2019re up to the challenge. The rankings below take into account a range of factors \u2014 pivotal moments, major themes, memorable performances, and the overall scope of Breaking Bad as an amazingly detailed story and character study \u2014 to come up with each episode\u2019s proper spot on the list. Debate and discussion of these picks are more than welcome, but remember: Maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.\n\n62. \u201cBreakage\u201d (Season 2, Episode 5)\n\nAgain, the worst episode of Breaking Bad isn\u2019t \u2026 bad \u2026 but this is one of the few installments you could skip without missing any iconic moments (unless you consider seeing an anxiety-riddled Hank package his DIY beer, Schraderbrau, a crucial piece of BB history). What the episode does include is a pair of developments that will pay off in big, tragic ways throughout the rest of season two: Jesse meets Jane and rents the apartment next to hers, and Jesse and Walt also tackle a DIY project when they launch their own meth distribution project by employing Skinny Pete, Badger, and Combo to sling their product on the street.\n\n61. \u201cI See You\u201d (Season 3, Episode 8)\n\nJesse\u2019s playday in the new meth super-lab is a welcome scene of levity after the intense shootout between Hank and the Salamanca cousins in the previous episode. But the rest of \u201cI See You\u201d amounts to Marie and the Whites waiting around the hospital with Hank\u2019s DEA brethren, along with a surprise visitor: local chicken restaurateur and DEA supporter Gus Fring, who generously delivers Los Pollos Hermanos meals to every cop in the building. Of course, Gus is actually there to calmly, coolly let Walt know he did his due diligence before their partnership began. Despite Walt\u2019s perpetually ballooning arrogance, he\u2019s still jarred by just how stealthily Gus manages to \u201chide in plain sight, same as you.\u201d\n\n60. \u201cMas\u201d (Season 3, Episode 5)\n\nThe highlight of \u201cMas\u201d is the opening montage, which tells the backstory of one of the show\u2019s most iconic visuals: the RV meth lab. The reason Walt\u2019s $7,000 life savings \u2014 handed over to Jesse for the purchase of an RV in the series pilot \u2014 bought such a hoopty? Jesse took the cash and blew most of it on lap dances and \u201cDom Perig-non\u201d at one of Albuquerque\u2019s finest gentlemen\u2019s clubs, leaving him with only enough to procure the dilapidated RV from a friend of a friend (it\u2019s Combo\u2019s mom). But by episode\u2019s end, Walt\u2019s fortunes have changed: Thanks to Gus, he now has the state-of-the-art super-lab of his dreams, hidden underneath an industrial laundry. The overture strokes Walt\u2019s chemist ego. The bottom line? Walt is cooking again.\n\n59. \u201cHazard Pay\u201d (Season 5, Episode 3)\n\nIt\u2019s early in season five, but Walt is already in full-on manipulation mode: He lets Marie know about her sister\u2019s affair with Ted Beneke. He meets Andrea and her son Brock, a rare bright spot in Jesse\u2019s personal life since Jane\u2019s death, and then underhandedly sows doubt into Jesse\u2019s head about whether he\u2019ll ever be able to truly open up to her about his life. As loathsome as Walt\u2019s poisoning of Brock was, this feels on par on the evil scale: Walt selfishly protecting himself at the expense of his son-like partner\u2019s quest to finally find some peace.\n\n58. \u201cNegro y Azul\u201d (Season 2, Episode 7)\n\nThe end for cartel informant Tortuga (played by none other than Danny Trejo) is the beginning of Hank\u2019s career and confidence-altering PTSD, triggered by the sight of Tortuga\u2019s decapitated noggin atop a tortoise \u2014 which then explodes and kills another DEA agent. Other key beginnings in this midseason episode that will lead to fallout that unfolds all the way through to the final season: Skyler\u2019s return to the workplace with Ted Beneke; Jesse\u2019s relationship with Jane, even after she sees evidence he\u2019s not your typical 9-to-5-er; and Walt using murderous rumors about Jesse to expand the business.\n\n57. \u201cOver\u201d (Season 2, Episode 10)\n\nAll it takes is the slightest challenge to Walt\u2019s ego or authority to bring out the worst in him, even when it comes on the heels of the good news that his cancer is in remission. Skyler throws a party, but the mention of Gretchen and Elliott\u2019s \u201cgenerosity\u201d in paying for his treatment turns Walt\u2019s mood harsher than the tequila shots he\u2019s slamming with Hank. Walt even pours a few too many out for Junior before Hank steps in, leading to a perverse father-figure showdown between the two men. It\u2019s a chilling illustration of one of the show\u2019s major themes, and it comes to a head when Walt spies some unlucky at the hardware store trying to jump-start his own meth-making operation.\n\n56. \u201cCancer Man\u201d (Season 1, Episode 4)\n\nThis early episode is notable for dishing up some of the series\u2019 trademark humor via a pair of gifts that keep on giving: Walt\u2019s underpants and Kyle Bornheimer\u2019s obnoxious, Bluetooth-headset-loving businessman, Ken. The episode opens with Hank telling his fellow DEA agents: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m thinking Albuquerque might just have a new kingpin.\u201d Smash cut to Walt, sporting tighty-whities and a Ned Flanders mustache as he sloppily brushes his teeth. Bryan Cranston is the once and forever master of wringing humor from prime-time underwear, as he would continue to do on Breaking Bad and had done on Malcolm in the Middle before it.\n\n55. \u201cDown\u201d (Season 2, Episode 4)\n\nJesse\u2019s parents kick him out of his aunt\u2019s house and take away his furniture, his friends won\u2019t let him crash with them, his motorcycle and remaining belongings are stolen, and when he tries to break into a junkyard to sleep in the meth-lab RV, he falls into a neither empty nor clean porta potty. Sure, Walt\u2019s going through his own stuff, but it\u2019s here that the sneaky truth really hits home: Jesse\u2019s usually the one who suffers the most for his and Walt\u2019s bad decisions.\n\n54. \u201cBug\u201d (Season 4, Episode 9)\n\nThis is the episode where Jesse really begins to see Mr. White for who he is \u2014 someone who places a GPS tracker on his ride due to a lack of trust, despite everything they\u2019ve been through. That valve of pent-up resentment bursts into a truly memorable, room-destroying brawl, ending with a bittersweet gesture that\u2019ll break the heart of any Pinkman sympathizer: When a battered Walt pulls himself up, Jesse asks if he can walk. Walt nods. \u201cThen get the fuck out of here,\u201d Jesse says, \u201cand never come back.\u201d\n\n53. \u201cShotgun\u201d (Season 4, Episode 5)\n\n\ufeffHoisted by His Own Petard: The Walter White Story would be an apt title for Walt\u2019s bio, and it could very well be the theme of Breaking Bad. Here, Skyler buys Bogdan\u2019s car wash in a genuine attempt to launder her hubby\u2019s ill-gotten cash, thus keeping her family together. Still, Walt\u2019s fragile ego is too busy being slighted by Hank\u2019s belief that Gale was the true mastermind behind the blue Heisenberg meth. Emboldened and dangerously proud, Walter convinces Hank that Gale must have been copying someone \u2014 which is enough to make Hank reopen the case and, in the kind of delicious irony Vince Gilligan excels at, discover the drug connection to a certain fried-chicken joint.\n\n52. \u201cBullet Points\u201d (Season 4, Episode 4)\n\nThe badassery of Mike Ehrmantraut, illustrated: Upon discovering a chunk of his right ear dangling off his skull after a Los Pollos Hermanos shoot-out, Mike simply rolls his eyes. He\u2019s merely \u2026 annoyed. All hail Mike.\n\n51. \u201cThirty-Eight Snub\u201d (Season 4, Episode 2)\n\nBut then again, even Mike is shook after the gnarly events of the fourth-season premiere, in which Gus\u2019s box cutter gets the best of Victor. But perhaps more importantly: A tormented Jesse does all he can to not think about having murdered Gale \u2014 and, sadly, fails. This is who he is now; his fate is all but sealed.\n\n50. \u201cKafkaesque\u201d (Season 3, Episode 9)\n\nBut don\u2019t get us wrong: Jesse may be one of the show\u2019s most sympathetic characters, yet he\u2019s not an innocent bystander. Like when he decides to sneak the overage from the meth lab \u2014 Gus\u2019s meth lab \u2014 and sell it himself. Also key: This episode also marks the first time Skyler really aligns herself with Walt\u2019s world, telling Marie that Walt won all his cash by, um, gambling. She even offers the Schraders a hunk of Walt\u2019s \u201cwinnings\u201d to pay for Hank\u2019s recovery from the Salamanca shootout. The episode\u2019s message is clear: Anyone can be tempted to break bad.\n\n49. \u201cGreen Light\u201d (Season 3, Episode 4)\n\nWalt says he\u2019s done with the drug business. Gus doesn\u2019t see it the same way. It\u2019s one of the slower episodes of the series, but one of Breaking Bad\u2019s brilliant trademarks was to let (seemingly) little moments like these set up big, unexpected, butterfly-effect consequences down the road.\n\n48. \u201cCaballo Sin Nombre\u201d (Season 3, Episode 2)\n\nWalt, tossed out of the house by Skyler, breaks in through the crawl space and reclaims his home. A power move, yes, but Jesse does him one better: He hires Saul to buy his aunt\u2019s $800,000 house for half the price. The real pizza de resistance of the episode, though, is Walt\u2019s hapless, pissy toss of a pie onto the Whites\u2019 rooftop, for better and worse: better, because it is one of the most enduring images of the series. But worse, because for years fans have been driving by the ABQ home where the scene was shot and trying their own pizza tosses, forcing Vince Gilligan to make a public plea for privacy on the owners\u2019 behalf \u2014 and when that failed, forcing the owners to erect a six-foot-tall wrought iron fence.\n\n47. \u201cMandala\u201d (Season 2, Episode 11)\n\n\ufeffWalt often maintains that his drug life is all about providing for his family, but in this episode, he misses the birth of his daughter in order to make his first meth delivery to new associate Gus. And before she gives birth to Holly, Skyler\u2019s off helping Ted Beneke hide his corporate malfeasance and singing a cringeworthy Marilyn Monroe\u2013style \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Ted. It\u2019s becoming clear at this point that the Whites\u2019 marriage is spiraling to the point of no return, and it\u2019s cemented that Walt\u2019s first allegiance is to Heisenberg and all that persona entails.\n\n46. \u201cBuyout\u201d (Season 5, Episode 6)\n\nMostly a setup for the rest of the season, \u201cBuyout\u201d features two key moments. First, Walt\u2019s admission that he\u2019s not doing all this for his family; he\u2019s really in the \u201cempire business,\u201d determined to make up for his Gray Matter investment blunder (which doubles as his supervillain origin story). That chat is followed by one of the last truly funny scenes of the series: Jesse\u2019s terrifically awkward dinner with Skyler and Walt at the White house. Jesse is a big fan of Skyler\u2019s green beans with slivered almonds. \u201cThey are from the deli at Albertsons,\u201d she dismisses. \u201cWell, you know, good work on your shopping, then,\u201d Jesse insists.\n\n45. \u201cNo Mas\u201d (Season 3, Episode 1)\n\nWhile the whole city is dealing with the plane crash caused by Jane\u2019s grieving father, Walt, Jesse, and Skyler make some life-altering decisions. Walt decides he\u2019s not a meth cook anymore, turning down Gus\u2019s $3 million overture; Jesse, reeling from Jane\u2019s death, decides he\u2019s a bad guy; and Skyler, finally aware of how Walt\u2019s making all that money, decides to divorce him. But the real highlight is a group leader at Jesse\u2019s rehab center, played by guest star Jere Burns, delivering one of the series\u2019 most memorable performances as a recovering addict who accidentally killed his own child while high.\n\n44. \u201cProblem Dog\u201d (Season 4, Episode 7)\n\nGroup Leader Jere Burns is back as Jesse attends a support-group meeting to confess how he killed a \u201cproblem dog\u201d who hadn\u2019t even done anything wrong. He also agrees, in spite of, not because of, a manipulative speech by Walt, to kill Gus. Walt\u2019s other partnership hits a glitch, when Skyler realizes he makes more than $7 million a year and wonders how she can possibly make all those stacks of $50 bills seem legit. And while Gus is unaware that Jesse is gunning for him, he\u2019s even less clued in to what Hank has found: Gus\u2019s fingerprints on a Los Pollos Hermanos cup match prints in Gale\u2019s apartment, which allows Hank to unfold for his DEA boss a theory about the seemingly kind fried-chicken magnate being a direct partner of the elusive Heisenberg.\n\n43. \u201cMadrigal\u201d (Season 5, Episode 2)\n\nShe isn\u2019t a Gustavo Fring\u2013level baddie, but the introduction of Lydia, Gus\u2019s American contact from the Germany-based Madrigal, nicely fills the need for someone to love to hate and hate to be entertained by. Of course, Lydia is also here keep the meth biz going post-Gus\u2019s death: She becomes our guys\u2019 main source of methylamine, a collaboration that spins a new web of connections and deftly carries the show to its conclusion.\n\n42. \u201cAbiquiu\u201d (Season 3, Episode 11)\n\nIn a pivotal moment in Jesse\u2019s development, he gets an up-close-and-personal look at the consequences of his trade via Andrea\u2019s son Tom\u00e1s, who, as part of a gang-initiation ritual, killed a man in a scenario that sounds a lot like Combo\u2019s murder. Later, when Jesse visits the scene of Combo\u2019s death, he sees Tom\u00e1s selling Walt and Jesse\u2019s signature cook. Elsewhere: Skyler insists on meeting Saul, who wants Walt to buy a laser-tag business. Skyler insists the car wash is a safer, more logical purchase. (Another loss for Saul!) It\u2019s a revealing peek at Skyler\u2019s ability to run a multimillion-dollar drug operation without the pitfalls \u2014 like, say, ego \u2014 that plague Walt.\n\n41. \u201cSunset\u201d (Season 3, Episode 6)\n\nHank is a bulldog when it comes to the hunt for Heisenberg, and he\u2019s just inches from blowing the case open when he tracks down the RV meth lab \u2014 but alas, Walt thwarts him once again. More crucially for Hank: Gus sics the Salamanca cousins on the DEA agent. \u201cMay his death satisfy you,\u201d Gus tells them. Truly chilling.\n\n40. \u201cI.F.T.\u201d (Season 3, Episode 3)\n\nHas Walt lost control of his life, or the people in it? When an increasingly distant and frustrated Skyler comes home from work to drop a bomb on him: Her day included some very personal extracurricular activities with Ted Beneke, an in-your-face declaration that she phrases much less delicately. Bonus: The episode\u2019s cold open shows how Tortuga\u2019s head came to be on that tortoise in Texas. (No surprise: The Salamanca cousins were involved.)\n\n39. \u201cBit by a Dead Bee\u201d (Season 2, Episode 3)\n\nAnd the underpants return! And this time, they\u2019re coming off. Walt needs a cover story for his disappearance at Tuco\u2019s house, so he really goes for it by entering a supermarket, getting naked, and pretending to have fallen into a stress-induced fugue state. It\u2019s enough to fool his family \u2014 most of them, anyway. But the seed of mistrust in the White home has been planted, setting the show up for major bouts of household dysfunction.\n\n38. \u201cOpen House\u201d (Season 4, Episode 3)\n\nAw, Jesse. Never having gotten over his post-rehab self-assessment that he\u2019s a bad guy, he continues to punish himself by turning his home into a war zone for strangers who are now stealing his appliances right in front of him. But this episode is stolen by the women of Breaking Bad. Marie, angry and beaten down by the bitter, grumpy, recuperating Hank, resumes her kleptomaniac activities, changing her identity as she visits open houses and pilfers tchotchkes. It\u2019s a delightful little adventure for the quirky Marie \u2014 until she breaks your heart with a meltdown in the police station. Meanwhile, Skyler has an adventure of her own, playing hardball with Saul to buy the car wash. She kind of enjoys it, too.\n\n37. \u201cGray Matter\u201d (Season 1, Episode 5)\n\n\u201cGray Matter\u201d provides the key to understanding what motivates Walter White, who sold his founding stake in the research company that could\u2019ve earned him millions of dollars and recognition in his field. Instead, he became a high-school chemistry teacher with a car-wash side hustle. So when he sees a trophy-lined study at his old partner Elliott\u2019s birthday party \u2014 and gets a mostly pity job offer to help pay for his cancer treatment \u2014 his ego can\u2019t handle it. Making meth is a way to provide for his family after he\u2019s gone, yes, but it\u2019s also the way to reclaim the power, promise, and \u201cempire\u201d he once felt was his destiny.\n\n36. \u201cDead Freight\u201d (Season 5, Episode 5)\n\nOne of the show\u2019s coolest action plots \u2014 Walt, Mike, Jesse, and Todd\u2019s intricately plotted heist of methylamine from a train running through New Mexico \u2014 is followed by one of the darkest, most disturbing moments. Having successfully procured a new supply of the chemical, the fellas celebrate the win, which was achieved without killing anyone. That is, until they turn around to see a young boy on his dirt bike. Todd takes out his gun without hesitation and shoots the kid, the only witness to their crime. It\u2019s just the tip of how chillingly cold and casual Todd proves to be when it comes to death.\n\n35. \u201cABQ\u201d (Season 2, Episode 13)\n\nThe fallout from Walt and Jesse\u2019s collaboration is literal: After Jane\u2019s death is discovered by her air-traffic controller father, he distractedly causes the collision of two planes on the job. Skyler, meanwhile, decides to leave Walt after he confirms the existence of his second cell phone while under anesthesia. It\u2019s a dark way to wrap season two, but \u201cABQ\u201d also introduces one of the great gifts of the Vince Gilligan universe: Jonathan Banks. It\u2019s almost too painful to mention that the Bad and Better Call Saul star has yet to receive the Emmy love he so richly deserves for his portrayal of Gus\u2019s problem solver, Mike Ehrmantraut.\n\n34. \u201cBuried\u201d (Season 5, Episode 10)\n\nWalt and Hank\u2019s inevitable confrontation happened in the previous episode, \u201cBlood Money,\u201d but this is where the game of cat and mouse truly begins, as Hank \u2014 thinking Skyler\u2019s unaware of Walt\u2019s activities \u2014 tries to question her before Walt gets to her. Walt, meanwhile, is busy burying giant barrels of money in the desert. And back at Hank\u2019s office at the DEA, a gift awaits: Jesse, in an interrogation room.\n\n33. \u201cCat\u2019s in the Bag \u2026\u201d (Season 1, Episode 2)\n\n\u2026 and the liquefied Emilio is in the bathtub. Until, that is, the hydrofluoric acid Jesse used to get rid of Emilio\u2019s body eats through the bathtub at Jesse\u2019s house. That causes the floor and ceiling underneath it to dissolve, and down rains the red, chunky goo that was Emilio. It\u2019s a disgusting, shocking, and honestly not unfunny visual, and one that proves Breaking Bad will amp up its stakes moving forward.\n\n32. \u201cSeven Thirty-Seven\u201d (Season 2, Episode 1)\n\nIt\u2019s in this Bryan Cranston\u2013directed episode we meet the charred, pink teddy bear, one of the more iconic symbols from the series. Furthermore, Walt and Jesse get kidnapped by Tuco, leaving every viewer tense with dread. It\u2019s the kickoff of the only season of the show the writers plotted from beginning to end before the season began, and in many ways, it\u2019s a classic Breaking Bad episode: a high-stakes hour that pays dramatic dividends galore.\n\n31. \u201cEnd Times\u201d (Season 4, Episode 12)\n\nLook at Walt manipulate Jesse yet again, this time using Jesse\u2019s affection for his girlfriend\u2019s son to his advantage. Walt makes Jesse think Gus poisoned Andrea\u2019s son Brock, all so Jesse would be convinced to partner up with him to kill Gus. It works, as so many of Walt\u2019s manipulations of Jesse do, even though their first attempt to end Gus\u2019s life \u2014 planting a bomb in his car \u2014 fails because the intuitive Gustavo senses something is amiss. It\u2019s a high point in the Walt versus Gus war, as Gus continues to prove he\u2019s at least, at least, as clever as Walter.\n\n30. \u201cGrilled\u201d (Season 2, Episode 12)\n\nTio Salamanca is one of the more stealth standouts of the series, and here, in one of the show\u2019s most tense episodes, is where we (and Walt and Jesse) first get to know the one-time drug-trade leader, who\u2019s now wheelchair-bound, unable to speak, and dependent on his psychotic nephews. So much happens in this episode: Tuco, having kidnapped Walt and Jesse, spirals out while his captors try to escape; Hank shows up for a shoot-out, killing Tuco; and Tio rings a bell a bunch of times. Bonus: \u201cGrilled\u201d includes one of the show\u2019s best off-beat openers, in which the rhythmic hydraulics of Jesse\u2019s car act as soundtrack to the Hank\u2013Tuco shoot-out.\n\n29. \u201cBox Cutter\u201d (Season 4, Episode 1)\n\nYep, Jesse really killed Gale in the third-season finale \u2014 something fans still wondered about, even though \u201cFull Measure\u201d wasn\u2019t intended to be a cliffhanger. Instead, the real shocker of this season opener comes when Gus uses the titular weapon to cut the throat of his henchman, Victor. It\u2019s not shocking because we\u2019re surprised Gus would do such a thing, or because he could do it so calmly. No, the real gut punch is that Victor is the victim, not Walt or Jesse. It\u2019s chilling, because we can only imagine what he\u2019ll do to the duo next.\n\n28. \u201cA No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal\u201d (Season 1, Episode 7)\n\nIf this Pontiac Aztek\u2019s a rockin\u2019, don\u2019t come a knockin\u2019. Walt is feeling pretty frisky: He and Skyler skip out on a PTA meeting to get busy in the school parking lot. \u201cWhy was that so good?\u201d Skyler wonders. \u201cBecause it was illegal,\u201d Walt tells her. On the heels of his \u201cHeisenberg\u201d confrontation with Tuco, Walt\u2019s feeling all kinds of confident that he\u2019s got this drug thing down. But his next meeting with the psycho distributor, in which Tuco beats his own man No-Doze for making a simple remark shakes Walt, and ends the first season by making it clear to Walt, Jesse, and the audience that to tough it out in the ABQ meth game, you need more than some science magic and a cool hat.\n\n27. \u201cGranite State\u201d (Season 5, Episode 15)\n\nThe penultimate episode of the series finds Walt and company as low as they can get: Walt can\u2019t get his stolen money back from Todd and Uncle Jack; Saul is headed off to a Cinnabon future in Omaha; Jesse is kidnapped by Jack and Todd and forced to cook meth; and Todd kills Andrea in front of Jesse after he tries to get away. A lonely Walt escapes to a secluded cabin in New Hampshire, where he awaits monthly deliveries of food and chemo. Eventually Walt trudges off toward town with a box full of money he wants to send his family. But even after a call to Walt Jr. ends with his son wishing for his speedy death, Walt\u2019s ego rears its head once again: When he sees Elliott and Gretchen, in a TV interview, disavow his contributions to the beginnings of Gray Matter, he can\u2019t help but trek back to Arizona, where he\u2019ll have the last word and wreak even more havoc and destruction on the ones he left behind.\n\n26. \u201cSay My Name\u201d (Season 5, Episode 7)\n\nIt\u2019s one of Walt\u2019s most triumphant moments, when he makes new distribution partner Declan acknowledge who he is: Heisenberg. \u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right.\u201d Walt spits back. Mike, too, reaches his breaking point, yelling at Walt: \u201cWe had a good thing, you stupid son of a bitch! We had Fring. We had a lab. We had everything we needed, and it all ran like clockwork. You could\u2019ve shut your mouth, cooked, and made as much money as you ever needed. It was perfect. But, no, you just had to blow it up, you and your pride and your ego! You just had to be the man. If you\u2019d done your job, known your place, we\u2019d all be fine right now.\u201d\n\nThis leads to one of the show\u2019s greatest scenes: Mike, suffering from a gunshot wound by Walt\u2019s hand, sits on a rock overlooking the nearby river. Walt keeps talking and talking. \u201cShut the fuck up and let me die in peace,\u201d Mike says, and does just that.\n\n25. \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d (Season 2, Episode 8)\n\nThey first made Saul Goodman\u2019s acquaintance when Badger got busted, but it isn\u2019t long before he\u2019s providing legal counsel to Walt and Jesse, too, as well as money-laundering services to the White family. He\u2019s also the man responsible for connecting Walt and Jesse with Gus and Mike, for better and worse. Despite his obvious flair, could anyone back then have imagined that this colorfully attired, fast-talking strip-mall lawyer could carry an equally terrific series of his own? Thank goodness Peter Gould and Vince Gilligan did.\n\n24. \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d (Season 5, Episode 1)\n\nWalt is insufferable after pulling off his plot to kill Gus in the fourth-season finale. He won\u2019t let Saul quit, Skyler tells him she\u2019s scared of him, and when he\u2019s annoying the hell out out of his partners with his cockiness. Yes, Walt is feeling his oats quite nicely, but another one of those signature cold opens teases that he will soon find himself in a very different, lonely place, celebrating his 52nd birthday alone at an Albuquerque Denny\u2019s. It\u2019s a delicious installment because we\u2019ve come to trust that when the BB writers tease the future with such a grand scene, the journey to getting there is going to be worth the ride. With this final-season premiere, there was little worry the series finale wouldn\u2019t stick the landing.\n\n23. \u201cPhoenix\u201d (Season 2, Episode 12)\n\nA watershed moment in the series: \u201cPhoenix\u201d marks the point when Walt let Jane choke to death on her own vomit after she and Jesse go on a drug bender. Is Walt motivated by concern for Jesse, seeing Jane as a bad influence on his fragile addict cohort? Or is he motivated by concern for their business future? Either way, this pivotal scene is the point of no return for Walt.\n\n22. \u201c\u2026 And the Bag\u2019s in the River\u201d (Season 1, Episode 3)\n\nWalt tries to decide whether or not to kill basement prisoner Krazy-8 (RIP to his acid-dissolved cousin). When Walt takes a sandwich to his hostage, they begin to bond: Walter discovers he bought Walt Jr.\u2019s crib at Krazy-8\u2019s family\u2019s furniture store years earlier. Walt is almost convinced to let him go, until he makes a heartbreaking discovery: Krazy-8, the only person Walt has shared his cancer diagnosis with, has been waiting for the chance to cut Walt with the shard of broken plate he had squirreled away. It\u2019s one of the biggest emotional wallops in a series stuffed with them.\n\n21. \u201cCornered\u201d (Season 4, Episode 6)\n\n\u201cI am the danger \u2026 I am the one who knocks,\u201d Walt crows to Skyler in one the show\u2019s most haunting moments. His boast halfway through the penultimate season comes before he\u2019s even handled his Gus problem, and before he fully understands the distribution side of the business. Walt isn\u2019t concerned with quashing his wife\u2019s fears; he\u2019s angry she had them in the first place. A combination of great writing, timing, and delivery, it\u2019s one of those scenes that has come to define our memory of the series.\n\n20. \u201cBlood Money\u201d (Season 5, Episode 9)\n\nThe series ending continues to be telegraphed in a cold-open flash-forward that finds a full-haired, 52-year-old Walt of \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d visiting the White house, now in disrepair and covered in graffiti. Back to the present, the action picks up from the previous episode, when Hank\u2019s bathroom reading finally provided him with evidence of who Heisenberg is. Walt, finding that his copy of Leaves of Grass is missing, runs to Hank\u2019s house, and the showdown that\u2019s been building for at least four seasons truly begins. Hank: \u201cI don\u2019t even know who I\u2019m talking to.\u201d Walt: \u201cIf that\u2019s true, if you don\u2019t know who I am, then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.\u201d It\u2019s the episode viewers had waited a year for, a satisfying hour that suggests the end of the series is all too near.\n\n19. \u201c4 Days Out\u201d (Season 2, Episode 9)\n\nNo other series or movie will ever make New Mexico scenery more dreamy than Breaking Bad did; color palettes and cinematography were integral to the the show\u2019s storytelling, this episode being a prime example. Plans for a marathon cook session in the RV, against the glowy-orange and crispy-blue backdrops of the desert sky, goes horribly, hilariously wrong after Jesse accidentally runs down the RV battery and gets himself and Walt stranded in the desert with an exhausted water supply, dead cell phone, and no gasoline for their generator. It\u2019s the ultimate Gilligan-ian irony: that gorgeous setting threatens to do them in.\n\n18. \u201cHalf Measures\u201d (Season 3, Episode 12)\n\nNot only does Walt follow Jesse\u2019s lead for a change \u2013 Jesse takes a stand against Gus when he discover that Gus\u2019 associates employ children to commit murder \u2013 Walt puts his own best interests on the back burner in the name of supporting and protecting his partner. It\u2019s a level of sacrifice on Jesse\u2019s behalf we won\u2019t see again by Walt until the series finale, and it\u2019s perfectly timed to bring the original duo into a tight alliance, as Walt\u2019s in nearing his most dangerous showdown yet with Gus.\n\n17. \u201cFull Measure\u201d (Season 3, Episode 13)\n\nThe final two episodes of season three form an intense, crushing story that earns both of them a spot in the top 20. When Walt tells an unhappy Gus that Jesse has fled the state, Gus brings Gale in to assist Walt in the lab. Walt correctly concludes that Gus is actually using Gale to learn how to cook Walt\u2019s product, making Walt expendable. The only way to fix this: kill Gale, says Walt. And it\u2019s up to Jesse to literally pull the trigger. Is he capable of killing an innocent man, even if it\u2019s the only way to save Walt? He is, and all it costs Mr. Pinkman is a piece of his soul, a loss from which he never recovers.\n\n16. \u201cRabid Dog\u201d (Season 5, Episode 12)\n\nWe jump ahead two seasons, where things have taken a drastic turn. Jesse wants Walt dead now that he knows the truth about Brock\u2019s poisoning, while Saul and Skyler insist killing Jesse is the full measure Walt needs to take. \u201cWe\u2019ve come this far \u2026 what\u2019s one more?\u201d Skyler asks with a coldness that says everything about where she\u2019s at right now mentally. Despite their many squabbles throughout the partnership, this is the first time Walt and Jesse actually make plans for mutually assured destruction. With four episodes remaining in the series, it becomes a supremely suspenseful question: Who will survive \u2014 if anyone at all?\n\n15. \u201cFly\u201d (Season 3, Episode 10)\n\nA polarizing episode that some people hate, and some people rate as one of the best ever, it rightly takes a spot in the top 25 percent of our list. It\u2019s true, the pithy plot explanation of the Rian Johnson\u2013directed episode is that Walt and Jesse spend many hours trying to catch a fly in the meth super-lab, lest it contaminate their product. That alone is a sign of Walt\u2019s need to be in control. While the two wait for the fly to make a mistake, Walt dives deep on his life, and admits that it might be better for his family if he had died already. Jesse also opens up, too, by talking about Jane, prompting Walt to \u2026 fall asleep. Jesse kills the fly, and they leave the lab for the day having personally reconnected for the first time in a while, one of those increasingly rare bonding sessions that would sustain their partnership until those final few episodes of the season.\n\n14. \u201cHermanos\u201d (Season 4, Episode 8)\n\nFor so long, we had waited for the smallest nuggets of info on the mysterious Gustavo Fring\u2019s backstory, and this episode is a gift rife with it. Flashback, 1989: Gus and his good friend Max \u2014 so close they named their joint restaurant business Los Pollos Hermanos in a nod to their brotherhood \u2014 approach Don Eladio about becoming the distributors of their premium meth. Instead, Don Eladio has Hector Salamanca shoot Max in the head in front of Gus, a major power play. This nicely sets up Gus\u2019s vengeful obsession with Hector Salamanca (and, on top of that, provides a significant, equally compelling arc on Better Call Saul).\n\n13. \u201cPeekaboo\u201d (Season 2, Episode 6)\n\nAaron Paul was deservedly nominated for an Emmy for this episode, the first of many times we see Jesse\u2019s instantaneous bond with children, which happens when he goes into the creepy home of Spooge and Mrs. Spooge. The events that follow are tragic: Jesse plays peekaboo with the Spooges\u2019 son, a sweet little boy who lives in front of a TV and immediately responds to the obviously rare bit of attention he\u2019s getting. But after a tussle with the family, an ATM machine topples over, crushing the Spooge paterfamilias\u2019s head. Jesse grabs their son and runs outside with him, where he calls the cops and tells the boy not to return inside. It drives home one of the show\u2019s heartbreaking recurring themes: Jesse\u2019s failure to become a strong father figure himself.\n\n12. \u201cCrazy Handful of Nothin\u2019\u201d (Season 1, Episode 6)\n\nWhat a difference a porkpie hat makes to a fella\u2019s confidence. Well, that and a crazy handful of fulminated mercury. Walt/Heisenberg gets Tuco to make a deal: two pounds of meth a week for $70,000. Walt also soaks Tuco for Jesse\u2019s medical expenses. The rush from his power play gives Walt the biggest goose forward yet on his Mr. Chips\u2013to\u2013Scarface journey.\n\n11. \u201cFifty-One\u201d (Season 5, Episode 4)\n\nThe series began with Walt turning 50, but just a year later, Skyler and Walt\u2019s marriage is effectively done. He\u2019s made it to 51, and during a small family celebration in the Whites\u2019 backyard, Skyler stuns Hank and Marie by walking into the pool fully clothed. As she\u2019d hoped, they offer to give her some personal time and take Walt Jr. and Holly to their home for a while. Anna Gunn won an Emmy for her powerful, too often underappreciated performance as a depressed, terrified Skyler. Here, she seizes her own measure of power: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d an exasperated Walt asks. Skyler: \u201cFor the cancer to come back.\u201d\n\n10. \u201cPilot\u201d (Season 1, Episode 1)\n\nBryan Cranston won his first Lead Actor Emmy for the series pilot, where milquetoast high-school chemistry teacher Walter White spends part of his 50th birthday moonlighting at a car wash, lives on such a tight budget that he has to juggle credit cards to buy a pack of printer paper, is constantly ribbed by his macho DEA agent brother-in-law, and boasts a love life that\u2019s reduced to distracted manual stimulation while his wife monitors an auction she\u2019s hosting on eBay. Oh, and then he learns he has inoperable lung cancer, and decides to cook crystal meth with his former chemistry-flunking student, to ensure his family is financially secure after he dies, which is likely to happen in less than two years. That alone is a concept that hooks you. But this excellent first episode sets the tone for what\u2019s to come: superb performances across the cast; a gripping visual style; and a delicious, unexpected mix of darkly humorous moments, intense action, and ever-increasing stakes.\n\n9. \u201cConfessions\u201d (Season 5, Episode 11)\n\nSkyler and Walt meet up with Marie and Hank at a Mexican restaurant, and they all know the truth about Walt. But that the series gives us the chance to watch the four of them confront each other about all that\u2019s happened is one of the most satisfying payoffs of the final season. And the showdown doesn\u2019t disappoint, especially when Walt gives his in-laws a DVD containing his confession. He owns up to cooking meth but shuffles the details to make it look like Hank is Heisenberg, and Walt was merely a victim of his machinations.\n\n8. \u201cCrawl Space\u201d (Season 4, Episode 11)\n\nRight up there with Cranston in his undies, that floating pink teddy bear, Skyler drifting into the pool, Hank on the john, and half-faced Gus, the moment when the camera pans to reveal Walt laughing hysterically in the crawl space of his house is one of the most unforgettable images of the series. Having found that more than half-a-million dollars of his blood money is missing, Walt just loses it. That it\u2019s been used to pay off the IRS debt of the man who had an affair with Skyler? Well, going temporarily insane seems like a perfectly rational reaction to that situation.\n\n7. \u201cSalud\u201d (Season 4, Episode 10)\n\nWhat other series could make you so happy to see a villain get his revenge? Gustavo Fring does just that, traveling back to Don Eladio\u2019s estate in Mexico \u2014 to the very poolside where he watched the murder of his friend Max \u2014 ostensibly to make peace and celebrate the cartel\u2019s new meth cook, Jesse. But Gus has poisoned the bottle of premium tequila he gifted to Eladio, and fooled him by imbibing some of it himself. As Gus forces himself to regurgitate his portion, Eladio and his crew start keeling over. It\u2019s a grand payoff for all that time Gus spent cultivating his cool, calm, patient persona. He finally gets to serve his revenge, straight-up.\n\n6. \u201cFace Off\u201d (Season 4, Episode 13)\n\nThere\u2019s the visual shock of seeing Gus\u2019s half face, when he\u2019s already half dead, after Walter carries out one of his shrewdest plots ever. Hector and Gus both want Walt dead + Hector and Gus want each other dead = Walt convinces Hector to detonate a suicide bomb that will also take out Gus. Forget chemistry, that\u2019s just good math. But Vince Gilligan, who wrote and directed the episode that would end the stellar Breaking Bad performances of Giancarlo Esposito and Mark Margolis, wasn\u2019t done with bombshells in this gem: Jesse learns that Brock wasn\u2019t poisoned by ricin, after all. He\u2019d ingested some sweet berries from the Lily of the Valley plant, which a season-ending shot reveals is growing \u2026 in the backyard at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.\n\n5. \u201cOne Minute\u201d (Season 3, Episode 7)\n\nAside from \u201cOzymandias,\u201d there is no more intense, perfectly crafted, acted, and directed (by Michelle MacLaren) sequence in Breaking Bad than Marco and Leonel Salamanca\u2019s attack against Hank. It starts with the DEA agent receiving a warning call that two people are coming to kill him in one minute, and ends with a brand-new ax landing on the ground, so sharp that its blade sticks in the concrete. Hank thinks it\u2019s a prank at first, but all his cop training and survival skills pay off here as he fends off two cold-blooded killers in one of the most gripping parking-lot-set scenes in recent memory.\n\n4. \u201cGliding All Over\u201d (Season 5, Episode 8)\n\nAnother Michelle MacLaren\u2013directed triumph, the episode starts with a brilliant sequence \u2014 backed by Nat King Cole\u2019s bouncy \u201cPick Yourself Up\u201d \u2014 where Todd\u2019s Uncle Jack helps orchestrate the killing of ten men, spread across three prisons, in two minutes. That\u2019s the good news for Walt. The bad news: At a party at Walt\u2019s house, Hank takes a potty break and looks around for some reading material. He starts thumbing through a nice hardcover copy of Walt Whitman\u2019s Leaves of Grass. \u201cTo my other favorite W.W. It\u2019s an honor working with you. Fondly, G.B.\u201d it reads. The look on Hank\u2019s face says it all, resulting in a blockbuster midseason cliffhanger that had viewers biting their nails for nearly a year.\n\n3. \u201cFelina\u201d (Season 5, Episode 16)\n\nIt\u2019s everything a series finale should be, wrapping up every major storyline, seeing our anti-hero get his revenge and face his consequences, touching base with fan-favorite supporting characters (hi, Badger and Skinny Pete!), and leaving some small pockets of hope for beloved survivors like Skyler, Marie, and, of course, Jesse. We still can\u2019t hear \u201cEl Paso\u201d or \u201cBaby Blue\u201d without getting teary.\n\n2. \u201cTo\u2019hajiilee\u201d (Season 5, Episode 13)\n\nUntil Uncle Jack (in another scene-stealing turn by a supporting actor, this time the great Michael Bowen) and his group show up in the desert, Hank and Jesse think they have Walt cornered. Hank gets to arrest Walt, and Jesse even gets to spit in Mr. White\u2019s face. But as Mike pointed out before his death, they all might have been better off with the devil they knew. When Walt throws in with Jack and his Nazis and that \u201cOpie, dead-eyed piece of shit\u201d Todd (as Jesse once referred to him), the situation turns on its head. But once Walt finally recognizes Jack & Co.\u2019s true natures, it\u2019s too late \u2026 they\u2019ve arrived and the shoot-out begins. Walt\u2019s ego has just insured his own downfall \u2014 fade to black.\n\n1. \u201cOzymandias\u201d (Season 5, Episode 14)\n\nWriter Moira Walley-Beckett, Bryan Cranston, and Anna Gunn won Emmys for an episode that could not be a more perfect hour of dramatic television. There were still two episodes to go in the series, and yet \u201cOzymandias\u201d (another Rian Johnson-directed installment) is such an emotionally trouncing run that it feels like viewers might have little left for dealing with the end. Walt offering his $80 million fortune to save Hank\u2019s life, Hank\u2019s immediate recognition that he\u2019s already gone (\u201cYou\u2019re the smartest guy I ever met, and you\u2019re too stupid to see he made up his mind ten minutes ago,\u201d Hank tells Walt about Jack\u2019s plans) \u2026 Walt, blaming Jesse for Hank\u2019s death, pointing out his hiding place to Jack, then taking glee in admitting to Jesse he purposefully allowed Jane to die \u2026 Walt kidnapping baby Holly, then calling Skyler to confirm Hank\u2019s death and carry out a harsh, ruse conversation that he hopes will prevent her from suffering any legal consequences \u2026 it\u2019s still, all these years later, almost too much for a Breaking Bad viewer to bear, yet too classic not to rewatch any chance you get.", "description": "Breaking Bad is widely considered one of the best TV shows of all time, but which episodes were the best?
