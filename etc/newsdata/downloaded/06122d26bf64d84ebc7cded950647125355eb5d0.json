However, the opportunities presented by the growing popularity of e-commerce also come with a challenging, multibillion-dollar downside: returns.\n\nReturn rates for e-commerce purchases are between 25% and 30%, compared with just 9% for in-store purchases. Turning reverse logistics \u2014 the process of returning goods from end users back to their origins to either recapture value or properly dispose of material \u2014 into a costly and high-stakes matter for retailers.\n\nNot only are retailers experiencing more returns as a result of e-commerce growth, but consumer expectations also demand that retailers provide a seamless process. In fact, 92% of consumers agree that they are more likely to shop at a store again if it offers a hassle-free return policy (e.g. free return shipping labels). Some consumers even place large orders with the intention of returning certain items.\n\nAnd e-commerce sales are only going up from here, exacerbating the issue and making retailers' need for help more dire. However, for logistics firms that can offer cost-effective reverse logistics solutions, this has opened up a significant opportunity to capture a share of rapidly growing e-commerce logistics costs in the US, which hit $117 billion last year, according to Armstrong & Associates, Inc. estimates.\n\nIn The Reverse Logistics Report, Business Insider Intelligence examines what makes reverse logistics so much more challenging than forward logistics, explores the trends that have driven retailers to finally improve the way in which returns move through their supply chains, and highlights how logistics firms can act to win over retailers' return dollars.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nE-commerce is now a core shopping channel for retailers, and it's still growing. US e-commerce sales are set to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14% between 2018 and 2023, surpassing $1 trillion in sales, according to Business Insider Intelligence estimates.\n\nBooming e-commerce sales have driven product returns through the roof. Business Insider Intelligence estimates that US e-commerce returns will increase at a CAGR of 19% between 2018 and 2023, surpassing $300 million dollars.\n\nConsumers have high expectations about how returns are handled, and retailers are struggling to find cost-effective ways to meet their demands. Sixty-four percent of shoppers stated they would be hesitant to shop at a retailer ever again if they found issues with the returns process. And retailers don't have the expertise to effectively keep up with how demanding consumers are about returns \u2014 44% of retailers said their margins were negatively impacted by handling and packaging returns, for example.\n\nLogistics firms are well positioned to solve \u2014 and profit from \u2014 returns. These companies can take advantage of their scale and expertise to solve pain points retailers commonly experience as goods move through the reverse supply chain.\n\nReverse logistics solutions themselves present a lucrative opportunity \u2014 but they're also appealing in the potential inroads they offer to supply chain management. The global third-party logistics market is estimated to be valued at $865 billion in 2018, according to Bekryl.", "description": "Business Insider Intelligence examines what makes reverse logistics so much more challenging than forward logistics, trends that have driven retailers to finally improve the way in which returns move through their supply chains, and how logistics firms can act to win over retailers' return dollars.", "authors": ["Ayoub Aouad"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5bb28e2098a1800a2c419d22-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-02"}
