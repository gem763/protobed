What if they had a boyfriend, girlfriend, mum, dad, sister or brother?\n\n\"One character's absence will impact a whole range of characters' stories.\"\n\nAnd if it's a major character who is being cut, it becomes a \"massive overhaul of everything\".\n\nUnfortunately for the story team, there aren't any easy \"one-size-fits-all excuses\" for the sudden departure of a character.\n\nIn the short term, the writer tells Radio 1 Newsbeat a good temporary fix is to say the character has gone away to visit family.\n\n\"It has to make sense and be in line with their character, you want to make it as satisfying as possible for the audience to watch.\"\n\nRe-casting\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kim Medcalf as Sam Mitchell won a National TV Award in 2002 for most popular newcomer\n\nPotentially the easiest option is to just hire someone new and keep the storyline as it was. But a change of actor can be quite jarring.\n\nIn 2002, the character of Sam Mitchell in EastEnders was reintroduced - but instead of Danniella Westbrook, Sam was played by Kim Medcalf.\n\nWestbrook then returned to the role years later, with no eyelids batted.\n\nBen Mitchell has famously been played by numerous people since his on-screen birth in EastEnders in 1996, and in 2019 Max Bowden took over from Harry Reid.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Max Bowden took over the role from Harry Reid overnight.\n\n'It was all a dream'\n\nWhen a member of the cast leaves, it's all well and good killing them off in the script - until they want to come back.\n\nIn an infamous episode of American soap, Dallas, a woman woke to find her husband in the shower - despite him definitely dying in a previous episode.\n\nThe story team got around that one by saying the entire plot of his death was all a dream.
