Pictured: Mosman, left, with his son, Justin\n\nHis death is the state's fourth this year and brings the nationwide death toll to 13, with four additional deaths reported in Michigan, three in Connecticut, one in Indiana and one in Rhode Island\n\nMost people don't develop symptoms, but those who do can experience chills, fevers, headaches and vomiting.\n\nOccasionally, the disease can cause seizures or life-threatening brain swelling (encephalitis).\n\nThere is no cure and treatments consists of supportive therapy such as respiratory support and IV fluids.\n\nAbout one-third of those with EEE die from the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHealth officials recommend that residents protect themselves by wearing long sleeves and pants as well as bug spray when going outside.\n\nThey also suggest draining any standing water from places such as bird baths and buckets because mosquitoes are attracted to still water.\n\nMosman's teenage son, Justin, has started a GoFundMe page to help aise funds for EEE research. As of Tuesday morning, nearly $3,000 has been raised out of a $150,000 goal.", "description": "Scott Mosman, 58, of Taunton, Massachusetts, died on Friday, becoming the state's fourth fatality from Eastern Equine Encephalitis this year as the nationwide death toll rises to 13.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19743098-0-image-a-20_1571147485554.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
