As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014 They were furious, both at themselves for wasting opportunities and at officials for a trio of \u201cawful\u201d calls that went against them in the second half.\n\nSeveral Detroit Lions blasted the officiating after Monday\u2019s 23-22 loss to the Green Bay Packers, saying a pair of hands-to-the-face penalties on Trey Flowers and a personal foul on Tracy Walker were incorrectly officiated.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think hands to the chest was a penalty,\u201d Flowers said postgame as he sat in the Lions locker room, pads still on. \u201cI thought hands to the face, but I had him right here in the chest. The second time I changed it to right here (another spot on the chest). That\u2019s part of a move that I do and, yeah. So, nah, I don\u2019t think that was a penalty, but they did, so\u2026\u201d\n\nThe first foul on Flowers came on a third-and-10 play with just over 10 minutes to left and nullified a sack that would have forced a Packers punt. The 5-yard penalty gave Green Bay an automatic first down, and three plays later Aaron Rodgers hit Allen Lazard for a 35-yard touchdown that cut the Lions\u2019 lead to 22-20.\n\nWhat \u201chands to the face\u201d looks like\n\n\n\nFrom a punt to a TD, all because of the refs.

Instead, with the Lions out of timeouts, the Packers ran the clock down to 2 seconds before sending Mason Crosby on for the final kick.\n\nReferee Clete Blakeman, in a pool report, said umpire Jeff Rice threw both penalty flags.\n\n\u201cThe last one was really the only one I\u2019ve discussed with him,\u201d Blakeman said. \u201cBasically, it\u2019s for illegal use of the hands, hands-to-the-face foul. To be a foul, we basically need some forceful contact that\u2019s prolonged to the head and neck area of the defender. So in his mind he had pinned him back, it was prolonged, and that\u2019s what created the foul.\u201d\n\nWeek 6 winners, losers: Cowboys at a crossroads while Chiefs searching for answers\n\n'That's what Dak says': Cowboys respond to Doug Pederson's claim Eagles are 'gonna win'\n\nFlowers said he used a technique he has long used as a pass rusher, and even changed his hand placement after picking up the first foul.\n\n\u201cThey saw something different than what actually happened and they called what they thought they saw,\u201d he said. \u201cI was doing it all game. I didn\u2019t know that was a flag to the chest, so I could change it to (another spot on the collar). They called it again.\u201d\n\nAsked if he felt like the game was stolen from him, Flowers said, \u201cUh, you know, it is what it is. I\u2019m getting ready to get back to work.\u201d\n\nThe Lions were called for eight penalties for 50 yards, two more penalties but almost the same yardage total (48 yards) as the Packers.\n\n\u201cWe all know we can\u2019t have those penalties, whatever it was that caused those to take place,\u201d coach Matt Patricia said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back and take a look at it and make sure we\u2019re coaching it better, make sure we\u2019re doing the right things. Just can\u2019t have them. We know how dangerous Aaron Rodgers is and how detrimental those penalties are.\u201d\n\nWalker voiced his displeasure with a unnecessary roughness penalty he incurred on the opening drive of the third quarter, when he hit receiver Geronimo Allison in the helmet with his helmet as he went for an interception.\n\n\u201cAwful. It was an awful call,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI feel like I went for the ball and just so happened we collided but I was looking for the ball. It was an awful call by them. It is what it is, though.\u201d\n\nBlakeman, in his pool report, said Walker\u2019s play is a penalty regardless of intent, that when there\u2019s helmet-to-helmet contact it\u2019s always a foul.\n\n\u201cExtremely pissed off right now,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt is what it is. Disappointed. Hurt. We had that game. It\u2019s going \u2013 I\u2019m going to say the same (expletive), we should have won it. It is what it is, though. Got to bounce back.\u201d\n\nAsked who he was angry at, Walker said, \u201cHonestly, just the whole game in itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like we could have had a better game and we was supposed to come victorious with that game but Green Bay came to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was some awful, awful calls, but we got to play through that. We got to overcome those, and so we didn\u2019t, obviously, and we came up short.\u201d\n\nTold he might get fined for his comments, Walker said he didn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cDetroit vs. Everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m saying it. Detroit vs. Everybody. It\u2019s awful.\u201d", "description": "The Detroit Lions discussed several critical penalties assessed against them in Monday night's loss to the Green Bay Packers.", "authors": ["Dave Birkett", "Published A.M.
