The angry-crusader angle revealed sanctimonious media self-congratulation at its most arrogant yet maudlin, and its sacrilegious offense was compounded by the aesthetic offense of its dreary indie-movie visual style. Spotlight\u2019s narrative epitomized the failure of Hollywood\u2019s political moralizing \u2014 a tendency of American filmmakers that reduces complex life to issues, as in simplistic good vs. evil antagonism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Fran\u00e7ois Ozon\u2019s By the Grace of God (Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Dieu) crushes the vain, insipid hindsight of Spotlight. Ozon, who is France\u2019s most accomplished provocateur-filmmaker, dramatizes the true story of how several Lyon men in 2016 brought Archbishop Philippe Barbarin to trial for harboring the priest Bernard Preynat, who they claim molested them as children. This time, Ozon\u2019s provocation lies in the reasoned measure he brings to this unsettling subject and to the presumptions typically perpetrated by the media about guilt and institutional corruption.\n\nBad-boy Ozon\u2019s interest in the ironies of surrealism and satire (Under the Sand, Sitcom, 8 Women, Ricky, In the House, Young & Beautiful) has shaped the depth and expanse of his steadily maturing vision. He compresses the numerous Lyon complainants into three characters: banker Alexandre (Melvil Poupaud), activist Fran\u00e7ois (Denis M\u00e9nochet), and savant Emmanuel (Swann Arlaud). They create a coalition, \u201cLift the Burden of Silence,\u201d but this is not a cheerleading tale of community activism. Ozon discerns each man\u2019s personality, his family relations, religious sensitivity, and social differences so that the film surpasses the \u201ccontroversy\u201d that excites American filmmakers and instead considers larger moral and spiritual experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the Grace of God is subtly epic. Its tone differs from the energetic panorama of Robin Campillo\u2019s BPM (Beats Per Minute) that re-created the AIDS activism of 1980s Paris. Ozon\u2019s composure recalls the intelligent distance of Fred Zinnemann\u2019s The Nun\u2019s Story, in which religious and secular awareness were intelligently balanced \u2014 respect that has been lost to contemporary, anti-Catholic, media-fomented hysteria. In this elegant approach (sumptuously shot by Manuel Dacosse), the story\u2019s bourgeois placidity is consistently undermined by the gravity of the characters\u2019 emotional turmoil. Their lives are shaken as the institution of the church is shaken.\n\nOzon depicts this catastrophe through the delicate precision of his performers. \u201cTime to leave,\u201d Poupaud starts the film, playing Alexandre, a father gathering his wife, four sons, and one daughter for church. But this also references Ozon\u2019s 2005 movie, Time to Leave (Le temps qui reste), which was about a gay man who, facing mortality, decided he wanted to procreate \u2014 a decision that, at that time, outraged the Village Voice\u2019s progressive reviewer but demonstrated Ozon\u2019s rich humanism. Poupaud\u2019s extraordinary performance here limns the ambiguity of men who are not gay with those who felt gay after their abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArlaud\u2019s Emmanuel describes his lost confidence, and Ozon depicts his tempestuous love life with Mike Leigh\u2013style realism, while the determined atheist revenge of M\u00e9nochet\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois rocks relations with his superficially cozy immediate family. Even the portrayals of bureaucratic Barbarin (Fran\u00e7ois Marthouret) and the abuser (Bernard Verley) attain credible pathos. Ozon told critic Alex Ramon: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much that I was looking to make a film about current events, more that I wanted to make a film about male fragility, one in which you would see male characters expressing their emotions and sensitivity.\u201d Ozon counters the trendy notions of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d and victims seeking justice. This insight into masculine vulnerability makes the film remarkable.\n\nOzon\u2019s cinematic sophistication easily contrasts with Spotlight\u2019s crudeness, but his art also shows in his details: Alexandre\u2019s demand \u201cI don\u2019t want apologies, I want sanction.\u201d His semantic discussion with Barbarin that \u201cthe words \u2018pedophile\u2019 and \u2018priest\u2019 are not compatible.\u201d So they settle on \u201cpedosexual.\u201d (\u201cC\u2019est juste!\u201d) And the differences of dogma and language continue when Barbarin misstates his feelings before the press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOzon explores this spiritual calamity using poetic motifs that rouse the imagination: Casual family portraits of Alexandre\u2019s nubile sons; the discovery of a boy in a classic Holocaust photo (the same one Bergman used to powerful, timeless effect in Persona); the tension between priest and petitioners when Alexandre faces Preynat, and his children making an appeal to Barbarin \u2014 meetings where sacrament and sacrilege mix; plus a Sylvester and Tweety cartoon that avoids bad taste through cerebral irony. The only misstep might be the emotive music that hypes a press conference, but the lapse into obvious sentiment is small compared with the range of tough responses Ozon shows in the film\u2019s mothers and wives, whose voices and eyebrows rise in accepting fate.\n\nFrench cinema\u2019s sophistication far surpasses the crass grandstanding of issue-oriented American filmmaking. Ozon\u2019s activists expose that difference when plotting their strategies: \u201cWe provide the information; the journalist will add indignation.\u201d Such propaganda has ruined topical filmmaking, but Ozon is crafty. True to his artistic commitment, Ozon understands the importance of not succumbing to political correctness. \u201cBaptism and faith override the institution,\u201d Alexandre says as he makes peace with his suffering cohorts\u2019 diverging paths. Ozon keeps his spotlight on human need.", "description": "Director Fran\u00e7oisOzon\u2019s provocation lies in the reasoned measure he brings to this unsettling subject and to the presumptions typically perpetrated by the media about guilt and institutional corruption.", "authors": ["Armond White", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
