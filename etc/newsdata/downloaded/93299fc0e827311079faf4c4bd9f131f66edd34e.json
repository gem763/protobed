Here, on the \"fairmile,\" motorists would daringly try out the speed of their carriages.\n\nMore: Home Prices in Prime Central London Bottoming Out\n\nOver a century later, the house that served as a \"gentleman\u2019s residence within an estate\" underwent a renovation by luxury developer Octagon. Today, the residence huddles behind lush vegetation booming around private gates that separate the property from the other 11 abodes in the gated enclave of Fairmile Court in Cobham, the U.K.\n\n\"This is the biggest detached house among 12 houses in the community,\" Mr. Corbett said.\n\nIn fact, two homes share the stately building. While one of the units could function as a rental, the two can easily blend back together to reflect the original single-family house, Mr. Corbett said.\n\nWith decorative balustrades along the edge of the roof, high coffered ceilings, big windows and hidden doors, both dwellings\u2014which have individual entrances\u2014channel a classic British opulence.\n\nThe estate\u2019s historic character has earned Grade II-listed historic designation, which means it has national significance and special permits are needed for any extensive alterations.\n\nMore: A Fully Furnished Model Apartment in the Tallest Building in London\u2019s Tech City\n\nStats\n\nSituated on an estate of a little under one acre, the building has three floors, including the ground level, and a total of over 12,000 square feet. The larger of the homes, 7 Fairmile Court, claims two-thirds of the interior with nine bedrooms and seven bathrooms. The other abode, 6 Fairmile Court, has five bedrooms and two bathrooms. Each residence has its own two-car garage.\n\nAmenities\n\nSeven Fairmile Court boasts a whole leisure quarter\u2014two drawing rooms and a sitting room\u2014that is flanked on two ends with glass-encased conservatories.\n\nBoth homes boast ample space in their basements for wine storage.\n\nBeyond the estate and in the nearby small towns that surround London, there are clubs and facilities for tennis, golf, squash, horse riding and cricket, among other sports.\n\nFrom Penta: Ed Ruscha\u2019s \u2018Hurting the Word Radio #2\u2019 Could Fetch $30M-$40M\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nSome 17 miles away from London in Surrey county, quaint Cobham offers a plethora of boutiques, restaurants and good schools. It also provides an easy commute to London, the country\u2019s motorway network, as well as the airports of Heathrow and Gatwick.\n\nLess than a mile away from Fairmile Court stands the manmade Claremont Lake and gardens, whose landscape harkens back to the early 18th century and features a turf amphitheater, the last of its kind in Europe, according to the U.K. National Trust.\n\nAnother idyllic location for strolls and picnics is the Royal Historical Society\u2019s garden complex at Wisley, some 15 minutes away from Fairmile Court. Here, in early September, the Duchess of Cambridge opened a new kids-centric \"Back to Nature\" swath.\n\nListing agent: Jason Corbett, United Kingdom Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\n\nView the listing here.
