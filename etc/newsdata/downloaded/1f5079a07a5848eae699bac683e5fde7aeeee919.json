He does not sit on any one of the six committees that are investigating the president. Nor was he among the group of freshman Democrats with national security backgrounds who had dramatically announced their support for impeachment in an op-ed the night before.\n\nInstead, Van Drew\u2019s claim to fame is that he\u2019s the guy standing athwart the impeachment train, yelling stop\u2014even though the train has left the station.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasize again, impeachment is an extremely serious issue,\u201d Van Drew explained to a different group of reporters last Friday, his cadence firm, friendly, and doused in a thick Jersey accent. \u201cIt is not something to be taken lightly. You\u2019re disenfranchising voters, you\u2019re removing an executive from office. That usually only happens in third-world countries.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Thedailybeast.Com Trumps-Favorite-Democrat-Jefferson-Van-Drew-Will-Not-Budge-On-Impeachment"], "top_image": ""}
