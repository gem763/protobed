Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6.

AP\n\nEngland could go into the game needing to beat France to qualify for the last eight, depending on how their clash with Argentina goes this Saturday, and even if they beat the Pumas, it is likely that their game against the French will be a shootout for top spot in Pool C, with the winners poised to face Australia in the quarter-finals and runners-up taking on Wales.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that Jones will leave Tokyo following Thursday afternoon\u2019s team announcement press conference, which is scheduled for 4pm Japan Standard Time, though there is only one direct flight from Tokyo\u2019s Haneda International Airport that would get Jones to Sydney for 9:30am AEDT the following morning.\n\nJones would then need to catch an overnight flight out of Sydney the same day in order to return to Tokyo in time for England\u2019s potential Pool C decider against France, which kicks off at 5:15pm Japan Standard Time in Yokohama, which is a 25-minute drive or 40-minute commute by public transport from Haneda Airport.\n\nIt would mean that Jones would miss England\u2019s captain\u2019s run on Friday at the International Stadium Yokohama, and provisions would need to be put in place should Jones be held up by any delay, with assistants Steve Borthwick, John Mitchell and Scott Wisemantel leading the team in his absence.\n\nHowever, the bulk of England\u2019s pre-match training will still be overseen by Jones.\n\nThe decision by Jones to fly back home for Sayle\u2019s funeral is no surprise given the friendship they had, which showed in Thursday\u2019s comments where Jones started his press conference by issuing an unprovoked statement.\n\n\u201cI'd just like to start today by paying a tribute to Jeff Sayle. He was a great mate of mine.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing for a few seconds as he choked up, Jones added: \u201cIt's very sad, a very sad day for rugby because he was a good person. He gave a lot to the game, to a number of players he coached and a number of teams he looked after. Even with England in 2016 he was the most welcome host. I remember going for a few beers with him at the Coojee Bay Hotel. Just a great fella and a real loss to the game.\n\n\u201cWe've got to make sure we keep those characters in rugby because they're so important and it defines our game. We've seen at this World Cup the great enthusiasm and togetherness of the crowds, opposing teams but with great supports. It's a sad day for rugby.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0head coach Eddie Jones is planning to leave Japan and fly to Australia just days before their crucial Rugby World Cup pool clash with France, in order to attend the funeral of close friend Jeff Sayle.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/05/05/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
