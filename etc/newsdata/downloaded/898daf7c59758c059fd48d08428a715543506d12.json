However, multiple reports suggest their decision will be delayed until there is clarity on whether the UK will hold a 2019 election or not.\n\nCorbyn is under mounting pressure from his own party to rule out a pre-Christmas election, amid polls suggesting the party would lose seats both to Johnson's Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats.\n\nA spokesperson for the prime minister said that the government would go \"on strike\" until opposition parties allowed an election.\n\n\"Nothing will come before Parliament but the bare minimum,\" they said.\n\n\"We will pursue a general election every day from then onwards, and do everything we can to get it.\"", "description": "The advertising campaign cost up to an estimated R2,6 billion but had \"limited impact\" on the public according to official analysis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9394/3c784caa8796458593bf2202ecc9c661.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
