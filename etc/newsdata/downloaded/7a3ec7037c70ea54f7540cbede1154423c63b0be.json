It had to sell three million holidays a year just to cover interest payments.\n\nWith the business draining cash, Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser found its lenders were no longer willing to step in. Fankhauser has earned 8.3 million pounds ($10.3 million), including 4.3 million pounds in 2015.\n\nThe Unite union said changes were needed to stop UK airlines collapsing at huge cost to the taxpayer, workers and customers.\n\n\u201cMinisters must legislate as necessary to allow UK airlines in financial trouble to trade in protective administration,\u201d the union said. \u201cOther countries do it as a matter of course. We should do it in the UK.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s British fleet was grounded immediately after the group became insolvent to comply with operating license requirements.\n\nBut its other airline operations in the Nordics and Germany, which are separate legal entities, were still flying on Tuesday.\n\nIn Spain, the country\u2019s Acting Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto told reporters that the ministry has been in touch with German and Swedish authorities to ensure Thomas Cook subsidiaries continued to operate at least for the winter season.\n\nBritish tourists staying in Sunrise Royal Makadi Hotel near the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in Egypt said they had no information about flights home.\n\nHolidaymaker Andrew Vick, aged 55, said: \u201cThere are no representatives to talk to here at all, which is understandable because they have lost their jobs, so they are gone.\n\nThomas Cook passengers queue in front of check-in desks on the second day of repatriations at Reus airport, next to Tarragona, Spain, September 24, 2019.
