The program is considered conservative compared to other states such as Illinois and Georgia with larger breaks and no cap.\n\nUtah enjoyed steady success in the entertainment industry throughout the 20th century as the site of the Sundance Film Festival and several high-grossing films including \u201cFootloose,\u201d \u2033The Sandlot\u201d and \u201cForrest Gump.\u201d\n\nHOLLYWOOD'S SUMMER BOX OFFICE BLUES\n\nBut production slowed in Utah during the early 2000s as other states introduced more competitive incentive programs.\n\nState legislators initially balked at incentive packages that required significant front-loading of state funds to support tax breaks and incentives for production companies. The stronger, revised incentive program proposed by Republican Rep. Greg Hughes was finally put in place in 2012.\n\nPearce, who began leading the film commission in 2014, leveraged Utah\u2019s proximity to Los Angeles and its unique scenery to attract more producers to the state.\n\nHer strategy helped cultivate a strong partnership with Disney, which has filmed at least 20 movies in Utah and recently wrapped up filming its show \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series,\u201d set to premiere next month.\n\nSusette Hsiung, the executive vice president of production for Disney Channel, has worked on productions in Utah for about 20 years.\n\nShe said Disney has benefited from Utah\u2019s family-friendly atmosphere and diverse filming locations.\n\n\u201cThe locations have unique looks . when we needed a herd of buffalo for (the film) \u2018Buffalo Dreams,\u2019 we found buffalo near Salt Lake City, easily,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when we filmed (snowboarding film) \u2018Cloud 9,\u2019 we shot at a resort in Park City.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s entertainment boom is part of a national trend in which several states with a strong production incentive program are experiencing \u201cexponential growth,\u201d Van Stevenson, a senior vice president at the Motion Picture Association said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nStevenson pointed to Louisiana and New Jersey as other states with blossoming entertainment industries by increased funding, new sound stages and legislators enticed by the industry\u2019s promise to generate jobs and millions in revenue.\n\nUtah has tried to keep pace with its rivals by investing in new production facilities and larger crews throughout the state.\n\nSeveral movies ranging from Christmas tales to thrillers are currently filming in Utah.\n\nHsiung said she would consider shooting more Disney productions in Utah but raised concern about the tight incentive program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to constantly go back and ask if there\u2019s enough money, especially when you\u2019re working with a smaller budget on children programs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tax incentive program makes a big difference.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nStill, Pearce said she is optimistic about Utah\u2019s future in show business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made great progress in the past five years ... when people film here for the first time, the main thing I hear is how impressed they are with the crew and resources they can find here,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they come back.\u201d", "description": "Utah\u2019s tree-lined suburbs and sweeping landscapes of red bluffs, deserts and lakes have increasingly dotted the silver screen in recent years, serving as the backdrop for several popular movies and TV shows including \u201cHereditary,\u201d \u2033Westworld,\u201d and the Disney Channel series \u201cAndi Mack.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/RT-Hollywood-sign.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
