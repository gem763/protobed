Report that\" were sprayed in red paint at the MP's office in the centre of his Plymouth constituency.\n\nMr Pollard, who is gay, told Plymouth Live the attack is a \"common slur against gay people\" calling on the person who did it to sit down and speak with him about it.\n\nIt is the second vandalism incident in less than a week at Mr Pollard's Frankfort Gate HQ, after the words 'Die Blair' were spray-painted on the door to the building last Sunday.\n\nThe MP said he had reported the incident to the police and thanked the council for quickly removing the abusive message.\n\n\"There is no place for hate and abuse in Plymouth,\" he said.\n\n\"When my office was vandalised last week we saw the most incredible and positive reaction from people in Plymouth.\n\n\"Lots of people dropped into the office and asked about me and my team\u2019s safety and welfare.\n\n\"This latest attack and the common slur against gay people it includes does not speak for the people of Plymouth.\n\n(Image: @LukePollard /Twitter)\n\n\"My offer of to sit down and talk with the individuals who vandalised my office still stands but they need to be aware that hate and abuse will not silence me in standing up for our city and it\u2019s people.\n\n\"The persons who did this are clearly very angry about something.\n\n\"The brave thing to do now is have that conversation with me. The graffiti has been reported to the police and will be cleaned off today.\"\n\nFollowing the previous incident, the MP said: \u201cMy office remains open and my team are at work, safe and well. They do a superb job every day for the people I represent and they deserve to work in safe and secure workplace.\n\n\"I\u2019m proud to be the first ever Plymouth MP to have a city-centre office and I believe having an office where people can walk up to while in town helps more people, makes me more accountable and is better for our politics.\u201d\n\nFellow Plymouth MP Johnny Mercer said in response to the latest incident: \"This is simply unacceptable in our city.\n\n\"Disagree with him all you like - and I do, but I\u2019ll forever defend his right to go about his life without this appalling abuse.\"", "description": "The MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport has vowed not to be silenced after his office was targeted for the second time in a week", "authors": ["Rom Preston-Ellis", "Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Penny Cross", "Plymouth Live", "Lukepollard", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735142.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PCP_DCM_190719lukepollard_013JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
