The broadcaster accessorised the cosy outfit with a solo white trainer, and her usual pair of sunglasses\n\nThe TV personality returned to work on Monday and joked her injury made her feel like a 'one-legged dog'.\n\nAmanda broke her leg last week while 'showing off' on a children's sea assault course on a family holiday to Cyprus with her husband Chris Hughes and youngest daughter Hollie, seven.\n\nShe told her Hollie she would go on the course with her, before slipping and breaking her fibia in two places.\n\nOn her return to work on Monday, she said: 'It was like an inflatable assault course, like Wipe Out, my eldest daughter [Alexa, 13] was on a school trip so Hollie was with me and Chris and she was desperate to get on this thing.'\n\nTough cookie: The TV personality returned to work on Monday and joked her injury made her feel like a 'one-legged dog'\n\nAdmitting she had to step in as the more athletic parent on the trip, she added: 'If you've seen my husband's hair, it's fabulous, so he didn't want to get his hair ruined, so he was standing on the side.\n\n'So I said I won't read my book, I'll try and be a good mother. So I ended up going on the assault course and went round and round on my hands and knees like geriatric I am.\n\n'There were some kids who bashed into Hollie and so I said, ''Excuse me, you can't do that on this'' while looking around for their parents.\n\n'Hollie was upset, so I raised my voice to these little gits. Hollie swam off, so I had to follow her, and there were these three stepping stones that I crawled over.'\n\nMaking do: On Monday evening, Amanda attended the Pride Of Britain Awards at London's Grosvenor House Hotel in a plunging black gown with vibrant fuchsia floral adornments\n\nSharing the moment she broke her leg, the TV star added: 'I ran on them really quick, made it, and then I got to the inflatable platform, but fell and twisted my leg back on itself, and fell back into the sea.\n\n'I'd never broken anything in my life, it felt like a shift. I've pulled tendons before so it felt like that but a bit worse. In the leg, I felt sick. I swam back one-legged while swearing and trying to wave at Chris.'\n\nAmanda insisted she has experienced worse things in life, explaining: 'I had to be put under a general [anaesthetic]... They've put a metal plate [into my leg] which is the best way to heal it because I'm very impatient.\n\n'There's a cast which they molded just under my leg, so I can lift my leg in and out of it, so it's hard underneath but soft on the top. I'm in full glam and a lash, things aren't that bad! I feel like a one-legged dog.'\n\nPainful: The star broke her leg in two places while 'showing off' on an inflatable assault course on a family holiday to Cyprus last week", "description": "The Britain's Got Talent judge, 48, left the Heart Radio studios in central London on a scooter on Tuesday after presenting her breakfast show.", "authors": ["Emer Scully For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/20328096-0-image-a-93_1572358582551.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
