(Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Haskins said publicly that he was OK with sitting, noting that players like Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers didn\u2019t play much as rookies, either. Other quarterbacks drafted this year: the Giants\u2019 Daniel Jones, Arizona\u2019s Kyler Murray and Jacksonville\u2019s Gardner Minshew have gotten to start already this season.\n\nBut coach Jay Gruden may well be coaching for his job this week, and could have seen making the switch as a way to try to save his own skin. Haskins\u2019 debut didn\u2019t change Washington\u2019s fortune much: He finished 9 of 17 for 107 yards and three interceptions in a 24-3 loss to the Giants.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Haskins' time has come.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jMDc9lnuY12Ao8X2IsxX2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODkuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NWKPhvyUSLK5hYwacBiwZQ--~B/aD0zNDQ0O3c9NDk1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d46dd760-e2e4-11e9-9b6f-6e8bf5645694", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
