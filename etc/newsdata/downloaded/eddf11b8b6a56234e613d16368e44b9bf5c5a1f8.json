Garner\u2019s dying words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA police sergeant who responded to the scene gave up 20 days of vacation time to settle her disciplinary case.\n\nLondon had earlier said he would use legal appeals to try to get the officer reinstated. He has insisted the officer used a reasonable amount of force and did not mean to hurt Garner.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton blasted the lawsuit, saying Pantaleo \u201chad a fair administrative trial\u201d that recommended his dismissal. \u201cPantaleo\u2019s decision to seek his reinstatement is not only disrespectful to the Police Commissioner and NYPD, but also the Garner family,\u201d Sharpton said in a statement. \u201cHe has shown no contrition or acknowledgment of his violent actions that ultimately killed Eric Garner.\u201d\n\nAfter Garner\u2019s death, the police department required all 36,000 officers to undergo three days of training, including classes focused on de-escalation. It also began training officers on fair and impartial policing, teaching them to recognize biases and rely on facts, not racial stereotypes.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The officer who was fired in the 2014 chokehold\u00a0death of Eric Garner is suing the New York Police Department to be reinstated.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/daniel-pantaleo.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C14px%2C2114px%2C1107px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
