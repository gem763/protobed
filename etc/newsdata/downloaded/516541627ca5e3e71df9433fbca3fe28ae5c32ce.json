Optimism amid reports that a draft Brexit deal is in the works sent the pound up sharply against the dollar.\n\nEarlier this year, financial services firms moved more than $1 trillion in assets to the EU and mulled shifting operations to other parts of the continent amid concerns over the divorce.\n\nBut Flewitt said, in the long term, whether Brexit happens or not, McLaren can be \"equally successful.\" The real concern is navigating the short-term disruption and uncertainty, he said.\n\n\"If we come out with no deal, we don't know what the trading arrangements (will be) on that first day, and disrupting things like supply chains of parts in, and cars out, has a ... really incredible effect on the business and on cash flow,\" he explained.\n\n\"We can build a great business ... against lots of different backdrops but, to not know what you're planning for, and not being able to prepare for it \u2014 that's the danger,\" he said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Silvia Amaro and Chloe Taylor contributed to this report.", "description": "\"It would be uneconomic to do anything else,\" CEO Mike Flewitt said at the 2019 Forbes Global CEO Conference in Singapore.", "authors": ["Abigail Ng"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106183395-1571183335961gettyimages-1128743569.jpeg?v=1571183410", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
