Contract factories owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd\u2019s Foxconn, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and others employ hundreds of thousands of workers to assemble Apple devices.\n\nIn recent years, Apple's contract manufacturers have expanded into other countries. India, for example, had no Apple contract manufacturer locations in 2015 but expanded to three assembly facilities by 2019, including a factory owned by Foxconn, which plans to make models from the iPhone X family of devices, Reuters reported last year reut.rs/2Nw82kJ.\n\nApple taps the India operations to avoid steep import duties on iPhones in one of the last fast-growing mobile phone markets on the planet, similar to Apple and Foxconn's move to open a production facility in Brazil reut.rs/2U9IuLj in 2011.\n\nBut the factories outside China are smaller and, in the case of India and Brazil, Apple only uses them to meet domestic demand. Apple\u2019s contract factories inside China, meanwhile, have added far more locations than outside, with Foxconn alone expanding from 19 locations in 2015 to 29 in 2019 and Pegatron going from eight to 12, according to Apple\u2019s data. The new locations come as Apple has added watches, smart speakers and wireless headphones to its product lineup.\n\nGraphic: here\n\nAnd beyond the contract factories, the rest of Apple\u2019s suppliers - the companies that sell it chips, glass, aluminum casings, cables, circuit boards and much more - became more concentrated in China. Among all supplier locations, 44.9% were in China in 2015, a proportion that rose to 47.6% by 2019, the data showed.\n\nReuters analyzed five years\u2019 worth of supply chain data published by Apple. The data includes more than 750 locations each year between 2015 and 2019 for the California company\u2019s top 200 suppliers based on Apple\u2019s spending. Apple does not disclose how much it spends with each, and the companies on the list can change as different suppliers make the top-200 cutoff among Apple\u2019s thousands of suppliers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A attendee uses a new iPhone X during a presentation for the media in Beijing, China October 31, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo\n\nReuters sorted the data and calculated the overall portion of Apple\u2019s supply chain in China. In a few cases each year, Apple did not provide a specific address and Reuters excluded that location.\n\nApple declined to comment on Reuters\u2019 analysis. In July, Chief Executive Tim Cook told investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put a lot of stock into\u201d speculation about how the company would shift production because of U.S. tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere,\u201d Cook said on the call. \u201cThere is a significant level of content in the United States, and a lot from Japan to Korea to China, and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. ... I think that will carry the day in the future as well.\u201d\n\nNO PLACE LIKE CHINA\n\nApple faces hurdles in diversifying beyond China, where the clustering of multiple suppliers allows it to make hundreds of millions of devices per year while holding only a few days\u2019 worth of inventory, which is critical to the free cash flow Apple investors prize.\n\nOther phone makers ship far fewer units and have more flexibility. Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google is shifting its Pixel smartphone production to Vietnam from China starting this year as it builds a cheap supply chain in Southeast Asia, the Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday.\n\nBut Apple\u2019s scale works against it because few other nations have workforces as large as China. Factories require highly skilled engineers to design and troubleshoot custom tools and processes. Vietnam, where Apple has manufactured accessories for years, has a population less than one-tenth the size of China.\n\nEven if Apple can make devices in India or Vietnam, the volumes would be small compared with Apple\u2019s overall needs.\n\nOutside of China, \u201cthere few places in the world that have the infrastructure to produce 600,000 phones a day,\u201d said Dave Evans, chief executive of San Francisco supply chain firm Fictiv.\n\nApple has so far been spared tariffs on major products, winning a reprieve last year on many wireless devices. And Cook has cultivated a close relationship with Trump over dinners and private meetings at the White House.\n\nApple has told trade officials that it generally believes tariffs will result in higher prices for U.S. consumers but has not said whether it plans to pass tariffs onto customers by raising prices.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nFor electronics products, where the circuit board is made can sometimes determine the product\u2019s country of origin, said George R. Tuttle III, a customs attorney who has worked with electronics firms.\n\nThat leaves open the possibility that device makers could make circuit boards or other key components outside China while still assembling devices there to avoid tariffs.\n\nApple has disclosed no such plans. But the India unit of Foxconn, which also performs work for HMD Global's Nokia-branded phones and Xiaomi Corp in addition to Apple, has developed the ability to make circuit boards in India, two industry sources told Reuters last year reut.rs/2Zx6HQU.", "description": "Tapping factories in Brazil and India has not lessened Apple Inc's dependence on China, the company's supply chain data shows, raising the stakes for the iPhone maker as U.S. President Donald Trump wages a trade war and promises more tariffs.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190828&t=2&i=1423744648&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7R1S6"}
