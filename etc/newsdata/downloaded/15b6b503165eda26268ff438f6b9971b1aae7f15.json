Why wouldn\u2019t they? The breakup had been amicable; after dating for a year and moving in together, they started squabbling over silly things and figured they were better off apart. They were on a night out in April last year with their friendship group when Elliot, a 27-year-old childcare worker from Lancashire, bumped into Tom, an old work colleague. They made small talk for a bit, before going their separate ways. But Tom had caught Kelly\u2019s eye, and the next day she called Elliot with an unusual request: could he set them up on a date?\n\nElliot wasn\u2019t opposed to the idea, but there was a problem. \u201cI said: \u2018I have no idea who you\u2019re on about!\u2019\u201d he remembers. \u201cWe\u2019d had such a brief conversation that it didn\u2019t stick in my memory.\u201d A few days later at work, Elliot\u2019s team leader mentioned Tom\u2019s name. \u201cI thought: \u2018That\u2019s who she meant!\u2019 I texted her saying: \u2018It\u2019s this guy.\u2019\u201d Kelly and Tom started messaging; Elliot even helped her craft the initial, flirtatious texts. It worked: Kelly and Tom now live together.\n\nMy partner\u2019s ex texts him every day. Should I be worried? Read more\n\nThere are countless articles online about how to find love after a breakup \u2013 or win your ex back, if that\u2019s what you want. Helping an ex-partner find love with someone new is an entirely different and much rarer phenomenon. But it happens. This month, New Zealand couple Damien and Whakarongotai Nikora\u2019s Facebook statuses went viral. They had posted announcing their split, and both had included a personal ad on behalf of the other. The pair, who were married for 21 years, titled their posts: \u201cWhy you should date my ex.\u201d \u201cIf you get the chance to date her, lucky man,\u201d wrote Damien of Whakarongotai.\n\nMost people \u2013 at least those whose relationships were not abusive or vitriolic \u2013 want their exes to be happy. But actively working to help your ex find love? It is unusual, particularly in monogamous circles. Some of Elliot\u2019s co-workers struggled to understand his actions. \u201cThey said: \u2018I\u2019d hate to see my ex getting with someone else.\u2019 But I thought, why? You\u2019re not together any more. Why should that concern you?\u201d\n\nAn advantage of setting up your ex is that you know their quirks and foibles better than almost anyone else, and can vet prospective partners for compatibility. \u201cYou know your exes, and you know your friends, so you can basically tell what sort of people they will like in relationships and what they do like and don\u2019t like,\u201d says Andrea Campos, 25, a lawyer from London. Two years ago, she was on holiday with a female friend in Dubai when Campos\u2019s ex-boyfriend messaged her. He had seen her friend in the photos Campos had been sharing, and found her attractive.\n\n\u201cI said: \u2018Do you want me to play Cupid?\u201d Campos says. He agreed. They dated for a short while, but nothing long-term came of it. She doesn\u2019t view her actions as remarkable. \u201cI\u2019m not a jealous person. If I think people will get on, I\u2019ll introduce them. You want the people you care about to be happy, and if you think they\u2019d be happy together, you might as well help.\u201d\n\nAlthough it might seem tempting to launch into your address book and begin setting up your former flames and friends, a word of caution: it is not a risk-free exercise. Perhaps you will discover that you are not over them or, if the resulting relationship turns sour, you may get caught up in the fallout. But if you are thinking of setting up your ex with someone new, the first thing to do is check they are happy with it before you do. \u201cIt\u2019s healthy to hope an ex-partner goes on to form other healthy relationships,\u201d says Ammanda Major, a therapist with the relationship charity Relate. \u201cBut it depends on whether your ex wants you to do that. Otherwise, you\u2019re treating them like a commodity, and selling them on.\u201d\n\nAsk yourself why you\u2019re trying to set up your ex. Are you genuinely motivated by feelings of altruism, or are you doing it to assuage guilt, or to prove a point? \u201cIf you ended the relationship and don\u2019t want them to feel bad about it, you might think that fixing them up with someone new will take their mind off it,\u201d Major says. \u201cBut it can be disrespectful to what you had, if it can quickly be overcome by being set up with someone new.\u201d Above all, respect a firm no. \u201cWe all think we know best and so-and-so might be perfect for them. But doing things without someone\u2019s permission is never a good idea.\u201d\n\nSetting up your ex with someone new is an acid test for whether you are truly over that person. If the thought fills you with horror, you may still have feelings for them. \u201cYou have to be honest with yourself,\u201d says Christina Gale, 27, who lives in London and works in social media. \u201cIf you\u2019re funny about an ex, you\u2019ve obviously still got feelings. If you\u2019ve moved on, why wouldn\u2019t you want to see them in a new relationship? I\u2019m not a jealous person. I think everyone should be able to find love.\u201d\n\nSetting up her friends with her exes has become Gale\u2019s signature move. \u201cI\u2019ve done this so many times!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI date people and think, actually, you\u2019d be better suited to someone else I know.\u201d One ex sticks out: they had been together for six years, but ended things amicably. He had started hanging out with another woman \u2013 as friends \u2013 but Gale was convinced it could be something more. \u201cI went to her and said: \u2018Do you think he\u2019s good-looking? She said: \u2018Yeah!\u2019\u201d Gale let him know \u2013 and they started dating.\n\nNot everyone can understand a decision to set up an ex. \u201cI have straight friends that say I\u2019m crazy,\u201d says Leo Camanho, 23, a student from Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThey say: \u2018You\u2019re so mature; how can you do this?\u2019\u201d He set up his ex-boyfriend Lucas with his best friend, Fabio, after he and Lucas broke up. He thinks setting up your exes is more common in queer circles. \u201cIn Rio, if you\u2019re not friends with your ex, you don\u2019t have any exes, because everyone dates everyone here.\u201d After Fabio and Lucas started dating, they came to Camanho for his blessing. \u201cI said: \u2018Totally, you are both friends of mine, I love you both, go and be happy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn New York\u2019s queer scene, 28-year-old Remy Duran is a legend. The reality-TV star became known across the city for his little black book \u2013 in reality, a mobile phone full of contacts, with subfolders categorising sexual preference \u2013 that he uses to connect ex-partners looking for love (or sex). Duran didn\u2019t set out to be New York\u2019s answer to Cilla Black: his matchmaking was an incidental byproduct of his dating life. As he dated his way around New York, his social circle grew, and former partners would hit him up for advice if there was someone they had their eye on.\n\n\u201cPeople would be like: \u2018Do you know that person? I\u2019ve wanted to hook up with them for ever. And I\u2019d be like: \u2018Sure, I don\u2019t own them, you can totally see them!\u2019\u201d His matchmaking is primarily altruistic \u2013 he wants to ensure people are having a good time. But there is also a deeper motivation. \u201cIt feels liberating,\u201d Duran says. \u201cYou don\u2019t own anyone, and it gives you a sense of closure.\u201d He has set up at least 20 former partners, ranging from hookups to ex-boyfriends. So far, so good. \u201cThey say thank you,\u201d says Duran. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any complaints.\u201d\n\nCuffing season: are people really coupling up just because it is winter? Read more\n\nPolyamorous people may be more relaxed than monogamous people about helping their exes date someone new. One polyamorous person, who prefers to remain anonymous, says: \u201cI don\u2019t see it as \u2018setting people up\u2019. I mean, they\u2019re poly, they bang whoever; I just introduced them.\u201d But outside of polyamory, setting up your ex with someone new is the ultimate affront to a monogamous dating culture that views ex-partners as possessions, rather than autonomous beings with free will. \u201cWe live in a possession-based culture where we see human beings as objects,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cYou \u2013 you\u2019re mine. Monogamous relationships can be like that. Even after you break up, people can\u2019t let go of that sense of ownership. But I don\u2019t think relationships should be possessive in that way.\u201d\n\nSometimes, setting up your ex with a friend happens so organically, it feels like an act of God. When Joanna Delooze was 20, she dated a man named Aaron. On one of their dates, Aaron mentioned that he had a list of qualities he looked for in a potential spouse. Delooze, who is now 55, made Aaron show her his list. \u201cI read it and said: \u2018I\u2019m not joking, but with the exception of one thing, my roommate Linda ticks every single box on your list.\u2019\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt was completely her! If I was a guy, and this was my list, I\u2019d date my roommate.\u201d\n\nDelooze was absolutely right: Linda and Aaron have been together for 35 years and have six children. She is delighted to have helped engineer their happiness. \u201cI see pictures of their family and all their kids and how they\u2019re still together and I think it\u2019s just great.\u201d\n\nSome names have been changed", "description": "You may find the idea of setting up your ex-partner with a date ridiculous \u2013 but, for some, it couldn\u2019t be more natural", "authors": ["Sirin Kale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b896ff763e0fb6aa8ea9974c7e02c515547aab/0_0_8889_5333/master/8889.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6bbaac1b174a99176e7db575dc8be640", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
