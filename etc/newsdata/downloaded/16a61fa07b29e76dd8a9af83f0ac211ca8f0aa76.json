Getty\n\nBuckland intervenes again\n\nThis is the second time that Buckland has intervened to insist that the UK government will not break the law.\n\nFollowing newspaper reports earlier this month that he was on the brink of resigning over Johnson's threats to break the law on a Brexit delay, Buckland tweeted that he warned the prime minister against such a move.\n\n\"Speculation about my future is wide of the mark. I fully support the Prime Minister and will continue to serve in his Cabinet,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"We have spoken over the past 24 hours regarding the importance of the Rule of Law, which I as Lord Chancellor have taken an oath to uphold.\"\n\nThe UK Supreme Court will sit on Tuesday for the first day of a case on whether Johnson acted illegally by suspending parliament earlier this month. The verdict is expected on Thursday.", "description": "The UK government's legal chief says Johnson's government will not break a law passed by opposition members of Parliament to delay Brexit.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d808af62e22af3d440f5a92-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
