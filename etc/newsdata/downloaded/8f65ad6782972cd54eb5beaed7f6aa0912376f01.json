Alternatively, follow along with live updates from Telegraph Sport.\n\nWhat is the team news?\n\nSheffield United\n\nStriker Billy Sharp is suspended and will miss the match while David McGoldrick is an injury doubt and will be assessed ahead of kick off.\n\nLiverpool\n\nSadio Mane is expected to be fit to play despite picking up a minor thigh injury. Divock Origi's fitness will be assessed closer to kick off while Allison Becker and Xherdan Shaqiri are still unavailable.\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\nSheffield United coach Chris Wilder:\n\n\"I don't want our players to look at them all starry-eyed.\n\n\"Of course, playing the best team in Europe at Bramall Lane was always going to be one of the fixtures to look forward to when we got promoted back to the Premier League.\n\n\"It's a reward for the supporters, who have stuck with us through thick and thin, and the challenge for us now is to make sure this becomes a regular fixture in the Premier League.\n\n\"But I don't want the players speaking to their players before and, 'can I swap shirts and any chance of signing this?'. And they won't.\n\n\"We are playing them on a level playing field in the Premier League and we deserve to be here. Of course there's enormous gaps between the both clubs at the moment and we're trying to make that gap a little bit closer.\n\n\"I don't want Liverpool to come here into our backyard and go, 'well, thanks very much that's the easiest three points we've picked up all season'. If they do win, I want it to be over our dead bodies.\"\n\nLiverpool coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp:\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Chris Wilder: \"It's incredible what he is doing. We are still analysing them and they are really interesting. Aggressive, good pressing when they have the ball are interesting patterns with overlapping CBs. Four years in England I don't know all the clubs but they are big.\"\n\n\"Both Origi and Mane trained yesterday, No issues. Alisson is in a good way. Not with us but a full session. He is getting closer and closer. Ali is not in contention for tomorrow. It looks like he can train with the team from Sunday.\"\n\n\"We are considered as a top team, we don't want to behave like one. The only advantage they have is their stadium, it is not allowed they fight more, run more. We go there for the first time and I am really looking forward to it.\"\n\nWhat are the odds?\n\nSheffield United to win: 7/1\n\nLiverpool to win: 1/3\n\nDraw: 19/5\n\nWhat's our prediction?\n\nSheffield United have had a solid start to the season and will be looking to make home advantage count. However, Liverpool's run of winning Premier League games looks set to continue as their attack has too much quality for the home side.\n\nSheffield United 1 Liverpool 3", "description": "Sheffield United take on league leaders Liverpool in both sides' seventh match of the Premier League season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NZaAlyyL9Y.cAe8IFT2qTQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hLBtiuS6PkXPB9Em3IFYOg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/8fba8eae427b9f968249e703ff07af9c", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
