They have cast his foray into politics as divinely inspired; equated him to biblical figures such as Esther, an Old Testament heroine; and frequently cited Scripture to rationalize his most controversial policies \u2014 actions that other religious scholars and leaders have found particularly cringeworthy.\n\n\u201cI think evangelical efforts would be far better spent critiquing their own shortcomings than sanctifying a president,\u201d said Matthew Rowley, a research associate with the Cambridge Institute on Religion and International Studies at Clare College.\n\nFor his part, Trump has inspired loyalty among his white evangelical base by positioning himself as a warrior against the secular culture they fear. He\u2019s frequently appeared at conferences hosted by conservative Christian groups, including the \u201cRoad to Majority\u201d summit put on by Reed\u2019s organization each summer; strengthened conscience protections for religious Americans in the labor force; nominated dozens of socially conservative judges for lifetime federal appointments; and fervently supported Israel.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason why many religious leaders support Trump is because he is great on life, religious freedom, judges, Israel, taxes, conscience protections, fetal issue and also because Hillary Clinton and his would-be opponents next year are so awful on all of the above,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\nBut the same official said there\u2018s a difference between the president\u2019s alliance with influential evangelical leaders and his private reaction to those who publicly fawn over his administration. Asked about Reed\u2019s book, in particular, this person responded, \u201cOh, for crying out loud.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

He actually abhors obsequiousness,\u201d the official said.\n\nIndeed, the president has been known to mock right-wing television personalities and former aides who have showered him with praise on their shows and in books. After an on-air interview with Sean Hannity in which the pro-Trump Fox News host admitted to warning Trump on Election Day that he was likely to lose, the president reportedly complained to aides about Hannity\u2019s \u201cdumb\u201d softball questions. Trump also teased former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who now serves as one of his personal attorneys, after he unabashedly defended him in the wake of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape scandal, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.\n\nReed, however, hasn\u2019t always heaped praise on the president. At the height of the Trump administration\u2019s family separation scandal at the U.S.-Mexico border, the former Georgia Republican Party chairman penned a letter to lawmakers encouraging them to pass an immigration bill that would \u201cstrengthen the nuclear family\u201d by ending the \u201cheartbreaking and tragic\u201d practice of placing migrant children and their parents in different detention facilities. And a person close to Reed said he has at times taken issue with the president\u2019s obscene tweets and profanity-laced speeches.\n\nBut when it comes to protecting the president and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill, Reed has gone all-in. His group invested $18 million in get-out-the-vote efforts during last year\u2019s midterm cycle, and he has warned conservative Christians that \u201cpretty much everything\u201d is on the line in 2020.\n\n\u201cOur plan in 2020 is to have 500 paid staff and about 5,000 volunteers. Some of these folks are knocking on doors eight hours a day,\u201d Reed recently said on a podcast.\n\nReed\u2019s book is expected to be released next April, seven months before voters will decide whether to reelect Trump. He has written seven books, including three political novels.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ef/49/2b9eb8474e2b9b9c52099c7b4436/191008-ralph-reed-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
