The coach made his decision and you have to accept it,\" Mbappe said.\n\n\"I just wanted to come on and show that it is difficult to leave me out of the side.\"\n\nTuchel insisted he did not choose Mbappe in his starting line-up because he was protecting his star forward, who was this week named among the 30 nominees for this year's Ballon d'Or -- unlike his perennially injured teammate Neymar.\n\n\"I always want to play with him in the team. He knows it,\" said Tuchel. \"But he could only play for as long as we gave him.\"\n\nThe only doubt surrounds who will play alongside Mbappe in the PSG attack, although it certainly won't be Neymar -- he is out until mid-November.\n\nAngel Di Maria will be there after setting up four of his team's five goals in midweek, while Mauro Icardi could again be preferred to Edinson Cavani after notching five goals in four games.\n\n'Le Classique' took top billing in France in the 1990s when pay TV giant Canal Plus bought PSG and turned them into a competitor to the era's dominant Marseille whose stars included Chris Waddle and Jean-Pierre Papin.\n\nThat helped boost viewing figures in a league which Canal Plus broadcast. These days Ligue 1 is utterly dominated by the now Qatar-owned club from the capital. Marseille, along with everyone else, trail in their wake.\n\nPSG ended last weekend five points clear at the top of the table and eight points better off than Marseille, with Andre Villas-Boas's team lying fourth.\n\nOne to watch: Dimitri Payet\n\nIf Marseille are to spring a major surprise and record a rare win in Paris, then they will need Dimitri Payet to be on his game.\n\nThe 32-year-old should certainly be fresh -- he has been out for a month while serving a four-match suspension but makes a timely return, although Villas-Boas has played down his team's prospects, saying Paris belong \"in a different league\".\n\n\"That is my opinion, given how much they have invested in recent years. The 'Clasico' is a thing of the past.\"\n\nKey stats\n\n8 - The number of years since Marseille last beat PSG. They won 3-0 at the Velodrome in November 2011.\n\n19 - PSG are unbeaten in 19 meetings with Marseille since then, winning 16 and drawing three.\n\n13 - The number of goals scored by Monaco's prolific strike pairing of Wissam Ben Yedder (8) and Islam Slimani (5) this season. They face second-placed Nantes on Friday.\n\nFixtures (all kick-offs GMT)\n\nFriday\n\nNantes v Monaco (1845)\n\nSaturday\n\nLille v Bordeaux (1630), Brest v Dijon, Lyon v Metz, Montpellier v Angers, Reims v Nimes, Strasbourg v Nice (all 1800)\n\nSunday\n\nRennes v Toulouse (1300), Saint-Etienne v Amiens (1500), Paris Saint-Germain v Marseille (1900)", "description": "An impatient Kylian Mbappe is set to make his first start for Paris Saint-Germain in two months this weekend after a blistering return to form off the bench in the Champions League.
