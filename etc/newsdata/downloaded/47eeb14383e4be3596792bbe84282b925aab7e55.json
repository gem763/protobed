He denies it.", "description": "London (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 A pro-European British minister who took Twitter by storm with walking tours and viral clips during his leadership", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/c79e65_rory-stewart-social-platform-announce-he-not-stand-re-election-johnson-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
