You have no excuse.\n\n\u201c\u2018You have never sung but someone has come to you and said, \u2018Give it a shot\u2019. And that is my motivation\u2019.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nTommy was born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a condition which causes the body to deteriorate over time and is 100% fatal.\n\nHe died in 1991, having been cared for by Martin and his mum for much of his life.\n\nMartin, one of five children, says in the show: \u201cWhen you grow up with a child and you fight over toys at four and he never fights back and then, by the time he is 13 he can\u2019t feed himself, you feel that you have no excuse for turning down opportunities.\u201d\n\nMartin adds that he is \u201cemotionally bowled over\u201d as he explains why he is competing to the judges. And Simon Cowell says: \u201cIt is always about the person and the story and we related to your story.\u201d\n\n(Image: Martin Bashir)\n\nSpeaking to the Mirror, Martin said: \u201cThat\u2019s my motivation. It is a very personal thing.\n\n\u201cI am 57 in January. In many ways people would say, \u2018What the hell are you doing it for?\u2019 and that is the reason.\n\n\u201cMy mum is still alive and she is 80 and the loss to her was enormous, but she also knows I was the main carer to my brother as a child. He was the most significant influence on me. More than my parents.\u201d\n\n(Image: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX)\n\nOn a lighter note ahead of the show, Martin admitted: \u201cI probably sound something like a constipated donkey but I am going to give it my best shot.\u201d\n\nOthers competing include a band made up of Love Island stars, Baywatch star David Hasselhoff\u2019s daughter Hayley and Jenny \u201cThe Vixen\u201d Ryan from quiz show The Chase.\n\n*X Factor Celebrity starts on ITV tomorrow at 8.35pm.\n\nmark.jefferies@mirror.co.uk", "description": "Martin Bashir lost his brother Tommy, and hears his voice in his head during challenging times", "authors": ["Mark Jefferies", "Image", "Pa", "Martin Bashir", "Dymond Thames Syco Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20553487.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Martin-Bashir.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
