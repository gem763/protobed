The party would govern Hong Kong through a loyal elite, while tapping the territory\u2019s capital markets and professional ranks to advance China\u2019s ambitious development plans.\n\nSuccess in Hong Kong would be leveraged to court reunification with Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory.\n\nSome local leaders fretted that their interests were subordinate to Britain\u2019s determination to close the book on its colonial adventures.\n\n\u201cThe British did not give Hong Kong people a choice,\u201d said Anson Chan, who was Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary \u2014 the second-highest position in the territory\u2019s government \u2014 during and after the handover. \u201cThere was a great deal of trepidation. Even among the business sector there was skepticism, because, essentially, you were turning over Hong Kong to a sovereign power whose philosophy, ideology and everything else was so totally different.\u201d\n\nMany Westerners expressed hope, however, that Hong Kong would help change China rather than the other way around, serving as a conduit for free enterprise and democratic ideas. Some maintained that global commerce would prove decisive. \u201cConstructive engagement\u201d would tether Chinese fortunes to world markets, and that would require liberty.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no firewall between economic freedom and freedom in its many other dimensions,\u201d Lawrence H. Summers, who was deputy Treasury secretary, declared in Hong Kong before the handover. \u201cThe free flow of information, the ability of people to remain free, to enter into transactions, to speak out: These are all the essential elements of free markets and a strong financial system.\u201d", "description": "The island\u2019s traditional role as a gateway is under assault from President Trump\u2019s trade war and a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.", "authors": ["Peter S.
