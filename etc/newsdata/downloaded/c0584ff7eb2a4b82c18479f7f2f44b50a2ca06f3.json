Problem was, this feature worked across the entire image; you\u2019d have to do some extra work if you only wanted to select one subject out of multiple or isolate a particular item.\n\nFret no more. Today Adobe gave us a sneak peek at a new AI-powered \u2018Object Selection\u2019 tool coming to Photoshop that makes selecting particular subjects easier than ever. The new feature lives alongside the magic wand and quick selection tools and is presented as a simple rectangle marquee. All you have to do is roughly cover your intended subject with the rectangle and Photoshop will automatically puzzle out what you\u2019re trying to select.\n\nYou could, for example, select one person out of a group of friends, making it easy to replace that one person you don\u2019t like. Or you can work on a smaller scale; you could replace someone\u2019s pass\u00e9 fedora with a classy tophat, for instance.\n\nIt works in reverse too: You can click and drag to subtract from a selection as well. And if you need a bit more specificity than a simple rectangle, you can use a lasso instead. The tool is also available in the Select and Mask workspace for those times you really need to get your edges pristine.\n\nOf course, these tools are never perfect. But when it comes to selecting complex subjects or working across multiple images, this could save you a ton of time. And as AI improves over time, the tool will presumably get better too. Adobe isn\u2019t saying exactly when the tool will arrrive, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, it can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\non Adobe\n\nRead next: EA games are coming back to Steam (but you still need Origin)", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FSnag_f61be.png&signature=e7bb194852eda07e6db6bb58990dc269", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
