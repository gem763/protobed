The Celtics could then re-sign Horford to the contract he wanted and then operated as an over-the-cap team to legally acquire Walker.\n\nAs Chris Forsberg outlined earlier this week, the major hurdle in the deal was presumably convincing the Nets to help a conference rival acquire an All-Star point guard in free agency without having to give up its All-Star center.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAccording to Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald, such a trade was discussed, and the Celtics were prepared to meet the Nets' asking price to execute the trade. However, the deal never got to the final stages because of Horford's commitment to the Philadelphia 76ers. He honored his commitment and signed a four-year $97 million contract with Philly on June 30.\n\nThe Celtics already had Walker's commitment days before free agency began, so Horford was seemingly locked in on Philadelphia well beforehand. Afterward, the Celtics were reportedly stomping their feet at teams tampering with Horford before he decided to opt-out of his contract with the Celtics. The level of tampering that occurred this summer kickstarted an effort by the NAB to crack down on such behavior moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it's all over now. Walker is a Celtic, Horford is a Sixer and Boston now must figure out how to navigate a Horford-Joel Embiid frontcourt without any proven interior defender on the roster.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
