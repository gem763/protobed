(Don Emmert/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images)\n\nby Chuck Culpepper in New York\n\nUpholding the premise that she possesses otherworldly guts, the 19-year-old Bianca Andreescu foiled both Serena Williams and a blaring Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd on Saturday at the U.S. Open, forging one breakthrough and thwarting another. She became the first Grand Slam singles champion from the flourishing tennis country of Canada, and she curbed Williams\u2019s latest push for a 24th such title that would level her with Margaret Court atop the all-time chart.\n\nFurther, the Ontario-born daughter of Romanian immigrants spent the closing scenes of her 6-3, 7-5 win regathering herself on the fly amid pretty much the most harrowing turn a woman on court could face during these past 20 years: Williams blasting back from a deficit, in this case from 5-1 to 5-5. Then Andreescu dropped the curtain fittingly on her third match point, taking a 74-mph second serve and sending it screaming like the Canadian wind past Williams on her forehand wing.\n\n\u201cI told myself to put the g------ ball in the court,\u201d Andreescu said of that last game, \u201cand just breathe as much as I could because she was serving, first of all.\u201d\n\nIndeed Williams was serving, a specter that has caused causing many a quiver. But she directed in only two of six first serves that last game, lowering her dismal match-long, first-serve percentage of 44, and she saw her record in service games plummet to a shocking 5-6, quite apart from 51-3 in the first six rounds.\n\n\u201cAll of it is, honestly, truly super frustrating,\u201d Williams said of her fourth straight-sets loss in a Grand Slam final in the last two years. \u201cI\u2019m, like, so close, so close, so close, yet so far away. I don\u2019t know what to say. I guess I got to keep going if I want to be a professional tennis player.\u201d\n\n[Sally Jenkins: Williams faces some hard truths after falling short again in a Grand Slam]\n\nAll the while, as Andreescu posted 17 unforced errors to Williams\u2019s 33, and as she fulfilled her game plan of making Williams play as many balls as possible, Andreescu had tweaked the perception of an occasion that came four weekends earlier: When the 37-year-old Williams retired against Andreescu after four games in the Rogers Cup final in Toronto, and when Andreescu walked over to console Williams while giving her the jock compliment \u201cbeast,\u201d that setting clearly had featured two \u201cbeasts.\u201d\n\nThe younger \u201cbeast\u201d indicated as much on Saturday in her first Grand Slam final, against a player in her 33rd, by improving her record against top-10 players this year to 8-0. Her name readied to romp further up the rankings from No. 15 and into the top five, which counts as really something given she spent last New Year\u2019s Day at No. 178. All this got real 12 months after Andreescu entered U.S. Open qualifying, then exited tepidly in one mere match.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, man. I\u2019ve been\u201d \u2014 and then Andreescu lowered her head and started to cry, before continuing \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming of this moment for the longest time.\u201d\n\nShe did all this in a setting that appeared tilted against her. The crowd rang with vehemence toward Williams but without hostility toward Andreescu from the moment it saw Williams on the video screen walking down the hallway toward the court. A stunning 20 years after Williams first appeared in a U.S. Open final, she walked out as a finalist in a futuristic setting, Andreescu wearing white earphones. The roof was open, the weather was pristine, and the clouds were puffy and harmless.\n\nThen the first game told much. In it, Williams led 40-15, but Andreescu got her into to banging exchanges that led to two Williams errors.\n\n\u201cI think she was intimidated a little bit by it,\u201d Andreescu said.\n\nAt deuce, Williams double-faulted, long twice. At break point, Williams double-faulted again, the first long, the second netted. The score went to 4-2 on serve from there, with an audience hungry for tennis history seeming to carry a sense of not again, considering Williams\u2019s gathering collection of runner-up hardware since her return in 2018 from childbirth.\n\nWith Williams serving at 2-4, Andreescu submitted her to five break points, all of which Williams saved as she showed her own familiar reservoir of will to hold. Yet when Williams got to 3-4 and then got to her first break point in that next game, Andreescu seemed so rattled that she placed a 103-mph ace into the corner. She held, then broke Williams, the set bookended with Williams\u2019s third of eight double faults.\n\nAndreescu began playing without concern, and Williams began coming unglued. Andreescu hurried to a match point at 5-1, but Williams presented a beautiful forehand return.\n\nThen: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t go down like that,\u201d Williams would say.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what champions do,\u201d Andreescu said of Williams\u2019s comeback.\n\nIn the quirky construct of tennis, some players have home Grand Slams while most others do not, and so Andreescu would say: \u201cI could barely hear myself think, really. It was really, really loud. But I guess that\u2019s what makes this tournament so special. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s really nice for the Americans to come on that court.\u201d\n\nNoise cascaded. Andreescu covered her ears. Williams cleaned up her game, got close to airtight, and fought. Then, with a hold at 30 featuring two service winners and a break at 30 with ripped shots, Andreescu fought more. \u201cI\u2019ve really strived to be like her,\u201d she said of Williams, \u201cand who knows? Maybe I can be even better.\u201d\n\nSoon, her coach, Sylvain Bruneau joined her in the interview room for a trophy presentation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not used to this,\u201d he said, standing next to her.\n\n\u201cWell, get used to it,\u201d she replied.\n\nMatch highlights\n\nby Ava Wallace in Washington\n\nGame, set, match: Bianca Andreescu wins, 6-3, 6-5\n\nAndreescu, a 19-year-old who played in the U.S. Open\u2019s main draw for the first time this year, beat Williams to become the first Canadian to win a Grand Slam singles title on Saturday at the U.S. Open. Williams\u2019 serve \u2014 the best the women\u2019s game has ever seen \u2014 was off from the first game of the match and Andreescu showed both incredible mental strength and physical power throughout the afternoon. She lost one match point up 5-1 and unraveled for a time after that, but held on enough to win the match. Williams is now 0-4 in Grand Slam finals after returning from childbirth.\n\nSecond set: Williams pulls even at 5-5\n\nAndreescu missed an easy backhand and Williams held on to even things out. Both players are extremely, and visibly, nervous right now.\n\nSecond set: Williams surges back, Andreescu leads 5-4\n\nWilliams saved one championship point and all of a sudden Andreescu\u2019s ball striking doesn\u2019t look so clean anymore. The pro-Williams crowd is getting into this one now.\n\nSecond set: Andreescu leads 4-1\n\nWilliams has gotten just 25 percent of her first serves in this set and Andreescu has won six of the last seven games to surge ahead.\n\nSecond set: Williams breaks back, Andreescu leads 2-1\n\nWilliams clipped a netcord on the final point of the game and with a little luck, broke back in the second set. Andreescu isn\u2019t letting any ball go unreturned; Williams will have to raise her game to stay with the Canadian.\n\nSecond set: Andreescu breaks early again, leads 2-0\n\nWilliams\u2019 service struggles continue. She double faulted at 0-40 to give Andreescu her first break of the second set.\n\nFirst set: Andreescu wins, 6-3\n\nWilliams ended the set like she began it, with a rare bout of poor serving. The American double faulted on Andreescu\u2019s set point and gave it to the teenager after an incredibly tense and competitive start to the match. Andreescu is showing no signs of slowing down and putting her power game on full display. Williams hasn\u2019t played anyone like this throughout the tournament.\n\nAndreescu had 12 winners and six errors in the first set.\n\nFirst set: Williams holds and Andreescu leads, 4-3\n\nDespite missing a lot of first serves, Williams saved five break points in the pivotal seventh game of the set to keep Andreescu from gaining a two-game lead. It\u2019s early, but that might be the game of the match.\n\nFirst set: Andreescu leads, 3-2\n\nThe Canadian is returning extremely well, and held serve to keep her lead. Williams won her first game with some huge forehands, big serves and loud screams but isn\u2019t hitting her groundstrokes as on target as she was in her previous two matches.\n\nFirst set: Bianca Andreescu breaks first, leads 2-0\n\nAfter leading 40-15 in the first game, Andreescu took Williams to deuce and the American hit back-to-back double faults to give her the break. Andreescu held her first service game for an early lead.\n\nSetting the scene:\n\nDuchess Meghan is in the house sitting between Oracene Price, Serena\u2019s mother, and Coach Patrick Mouratoglou, and Serena Williams started things off with an ace.
