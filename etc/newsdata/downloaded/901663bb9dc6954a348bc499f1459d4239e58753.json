During the 13-12 loss to Houston in Week 2, he and Marrone got into it on the sideline, but Ramsey told ESPN\u2019s Ryan Clark that he and Marrone \u201calways had a straight relationship.\u201d Yahoo\u2019s Charles Robinson had reported that the problem lay with Coughlin, an old-school former coach.\n\nRamsey said his relationship with the team deteriorated \u201cwhen there was a front-office change\u201d and \u201csome guys were put in positions of power who didn\u2019t care to understand, I guess you could say, this generation of guys \u2014 us as players or as people in general.\u201d The only major front-office change during Ramsey\u2019s three-plus years in Jacksonville came in 2017 when Coughlin was named to his position.\n\nRamsey claimed that \u201csome guys in the front office\u201d bad-mouthed him to the media when he decided to stay away from voluntary workouts. \u201cI was basically portrayed, I guess you could say, as a bum, to be honest.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe went on to add that \u201crubbed me the wrong way because that is not who I am.\u201d\n\nAfter the incident with Marrone, Ramsey was \u201ccalled into a meeting,\u201d he told Clark. \u201cI am not going to go into all the details of that meeting, but it was some front office guys in that meeting, about four guys, and myself. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe disrespect got to another level in that meeting, and mind you, Coach Marrone wasn\u2019t even in that meeting.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear who was in the meeting, but Ramsey said, \u201cIt was a conversation as man that like, you are not going to talk to me this way. This tone you are talking to me in, you are not going to talk to me in this tone. The things you are saying, you are not going to say that, because you wouldn\u2019t say this if we were in another space.\u201d\n\nRead more NFL coverage from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The cornerback had demanded a trade all season and the Jaguars' owner finally gave in.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KghkE16fmzWyBcRIMk6nOFRB8ug=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ST7EP5XTLEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
