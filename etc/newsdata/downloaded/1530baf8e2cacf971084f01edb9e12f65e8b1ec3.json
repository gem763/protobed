Held on the online training platform Zwift, it was alleged that the Cornwall-based rider used a bot to give him an unfair advantage over his competitors.\n\n\u201cThe charge relates to manipulation of data before the finals,\u201d said Chris Snook, senior PR manager at Zwift. \u201cJeffers used a bot to ride on multiple occasions at 2000 watts for distances of over 200km with a weight of 45kg. The \u2018botting\u2019 helped Jeffers unlock the Zwift Concept Z1 bike (commonly referred to as the Tron bike). It was deemed by British Cycling as an attempt to gain unfair advantage and was in breach of clause 5 of their disciplinary code.\u201d\n\nJeffers has accepted his punishment, with second place finisher James Phillips awarded the title instead.\n\n\u201cDefending fair play in our competitions is at the core of our responsibilities as a governing body,\u201d said British Cycling integrity and compliance director Rod Findlay.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have been able to investigate the offence and uphold the charge reflects the strength of our new disciplinary regulations and our determination to pursue misconduct.\u201d", "description": "The inaugural winner of the British eRacing Championships has been banned for \u2018manipulation of pre-race data to gain an unfair advantage via in-game equipment\u2019", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa43646e7118ec773f5ff66eca386df381895c3b/59_0_2212_1327/master/2212.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=efefa641e2494c4c9a38907aa49f4b35", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
