Men aren\u2019t necessities, she once said, they are luxuries\n\nThere she is, glimpsed through a gloaming of strobe lights and a muscled writhing of hunky dancers.\n\nThere she stands, under a kilo of acrylic hair with that knowing, Mona Lisa smile on her face.\n\nThere she goes, dancing across the stage in fishnets as her Here We Go Again tour finally lands in London. Yes, Cher is back in town. Cher. Cher! In darling person.\n\nIn the marvellous here and now. On yet another of her farewell tours that promise to be the last ever, but somehow never are and thank goodness for that.\n\nWe have been here before and one can only hope we will be here again, to witness the Planet\u2019s sassiest septuagenarian climb into the cobwebbed body stockings and pipistrelle bat-sized bras she first wore more than 20 years ago \u2014 and still looks wonderful in today.\n\nFor to gaze upon Cher singing Turn Back Time in little more than a spangled leotard and a leather jacket will never stop being an awe inspiring sight, even more so as the decades fall like dominoes around her.\n\nIt is to actually believe, even for a frangible, serum-pumped airbrushed second, that maybe time can be turned back. Can it? Can it?\n\n\u2018I\u2019m 73 years old. What is your grandma doing tonight?\u2019 Cher asked the 20,000 capacity crowd at the O2 early in the evening.\n\nCher looks slim hipped and ageless in a purple velvet catsuit and blonde wig; incredible in faded denim and a red wig; sensational in her costume from the film Burlesque; and is also pictured performing in Zurich, right\n\nHer message was that this particular granny had a lot more on her agenda than a milky drink and an early night.\n\nThat included myriad costume changes, a burlesque interlude, an Abba tribute, an absolute Muppet show of marvellous wigs and even a number in which she wore harem pants and climbed atop a life-sized mechanical elephant to sing a devotional chant called the Gayatri Mantra.\n\nSuffice to say this was a rock show devoid of irony or restraint, and all the better for it.\n\nMany years ago, Cher remarked that being ridiculous was a dirty job but \u2018if someone has to do it, it might as well be me\u2019.\n\nShe also believes that \u2018until you are ready to look foolish, you will never have the possibility of being great\u2019.\n\nWe have been here before and one can only hope we will be here again, to witness the Planet\u2019s sassiest septuagenarian climb into the cobwebbed body stockings and pipistrelle bat-sized bras she first wore more than 20 years ago \u2014 and still looks wonderful in today\n\nPerhaps that is one reason why she is a Halloween costume made flesh, a hallucination, a mirage, a miracle. How does she do it?\n\nIn a long and sometimes rambling monologue near the beginning of the show, she preached Cher speak to her Cher fans from the Bible of Cher.\n\nYounger women listen up! \u2018You have to do everything you want to do, you can\u2019t take no for an answer.\u2019\n\nOlder women change your ways! \u2018Get a new life \u2014 do something fabulous,\u2019 she implored us.\n\nWhatever, we were not going to get far in this concert without outspoken Cher airing some of her political views. Nothing unexpected there.\n\nThe diva called President Donald Trump an \u2018a******\u2019 before opining that: \u2018Boris isn\u2019t much better.\u2019\n\nMaybe he is and maybe he isn\u2019t, but how can Cher possibly know? I doubt even she sits down to devour the latest Brexit news at breakfast, while elves iron her thighs and a liveried butler pours her a great big cup of suck-it-up from the fountain of eternal youth.\n\nBut to love Cher is to forgive her for everything, even that power ballad about Jesse James back in the Eighties.\n\nIn a long and sometimes rambling monologue near the beginning of the show, she preached Cher speak to her Cher fans from the Bible of Cher. Younger women listen up! \u2018You have to do everything you want to do, you can\u2019t take no for an answer'\n\nNever mind the political chat and the spangles, the most amazing thing about the evening is that Cher\u2019s voice still sounds tremendous; bold and strong, smoked with her trademark husky vibrato, still capable of conveying passion and vulnerability with every throbbing note.\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons for her diamond-studded longevity and right honourable diva status is that she has always been so inspiring; her songs speak of good triumphing over bad, of self-belief and the power of personal aspiration.\n\n(\u2018What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well I can\u2019t do that,\u2019 as she sings in her big hit Believe.)\n\nShe has been a star for six decades and was a feminist before feminists had been invented.\n\nMen aren\u2019t necessities, she once said, they are luxuries. They should be like Kleenex, soft strong and disposable.\n\nI met her once, on a winter morning almost 20 years ago, where she sipped hotel tea in her thermal vest and sheepskin boots, and complained lightly about the English weather.\n\nTwo years earlier she had told the world that turning 50 \u2018sucked\u2019, but that she was determined to live her life with a flourish until the very last gasp.\n\n\u2018Everyone says that I am terrified of getting old,\u2019 she said back then, \u2018but the truth is that in my job, becoming old and becoming extinct are one and the same thing. And becoming obsolete and useless is completely unattractive to me.\u2019\n\nShe was funny and kind, not at all what I expected (\u2018I am actually very boring\u2019). And ask yourself this? Has anyone fought the ravages of time with more spirit and energy than she?\n\nThe former Cherilyn Sarkisian La Piere has admitted to nose, breast and teeth operations. She had her first piece of reconstructive surgery after seeing herself on film for the very first time in 1967.\n\n\u2018I looked at myself up there on that screen and thought, s***, I\u2019m all nose.\u2019 She has always been the first to poke fun at herself, and has never lost her sense of humour.\n\nShe was born in California, the daughter of a part Cherokee mother and Armenian father \u2014 a gambler and a drug addict who left home shortly before Cher was born.\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons for her diamond-studded longevity and right honourable diva status is that she has always been so inspiring; her songs speak of good triumphing over bad, of self-belief and the power of personal aspiration\n\nBy the time she had reached her teens her mother had married a bank vice-president and the family enjoyed a middle-class way of life in Encino.\n\nYet that wasn\u2019t easy. Cher grew up amid a flock of blonde, blue-eyed Californian girls \u2014 her half-sisters, her classmates \u2014 and always felt like a cuckoo in the nest.\n\nShe always had that sense of apartness. When she went to Armenia for the first time in the Eighties she was shocked. \u2018Everyone looked like me,\u2019 she said.\n\nSonny Bono was her first salvation, she married him when she was 16. They had musical aspirations together and they went on to epitomise a kind of Californian cool throughout the Sixties.\n\nThey divorced in 1975 and Cher spent years baiting him when he became a Republican congressman.\n\nYet when he died in a skiing accident in 1998, she was bereft. \u2018I always cared about him,\u2019 she said.\n\nDuring the concert, she wears a bobbed wig and bellbottoms to sing their greatest hit, I\u2019ve Got You, Babe.\n\nHer voice is real, a plangent soar through that lovely chorus, but his is a recording from beyond the grave, beaming through the auditorium as his image hovers over the stage. It could \u2014 and perhaps should \u2014 have been mawkish, but it is oddly moving instead.\n\nThe costume changes come thick and fast. I counted 12 in the 90-minute set, but the sequins, feathers, wigs and glitz became a confusing blizzard of utter fabuloso.\n\nCher looks slim hipped and ageless in a purple velvet catsuit and blonde wig; incredible in faded denim and a red wig; sensational in her costume from the film Burlesque.\n\nThere is a medley of tracks from her recent Abba covers album and a nod to her successes on stage and on film.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never really been accepted by singers as a singer, and actors don\u2019t think of me as an actor,\u2019 she said. \u2018I actually succeeded at everything I ever tried, and yet I\u2019m not part of any of the groups.\u2019\n\nA 60-year career, a testament to the staying power of an amazing voice, a sense of humour and a great pair of legs.\n\nCher may be many things, but she is distinctly not extinct.", "description": "JAN MOIR: There she goes, dancing across the stage in fishnets as her Here We Go Again tour finally lands in London.
