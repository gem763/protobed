When that movie came out, I too was an immigrant kid from the former USSR who felt like my foreignness had marked me for life. I remember being soothed and enthralled by the idea of teenage freaks all living happily together in a special school for mutants.\n\nSince then, however, my tastes have trended away from action and sci-fi, and I haven\u2019t seen many movies with such pure, powerful protagonists. In fact, I wondered if the rise of antihero TV shows might be messing up this superhero strategy. My favorite shows recently have been Succession and Fleabag, two series that are known for being fun to watch precisely because the main characters make terrible decisions. When it comes to these shows, I\u2019m as committed as a geek could be: I read the recaps even if I\u2019ve seen the episode and I steer any and all conversations with friends toward the latest plot points. I\u2019m one step away from buying an Argestes fleece. But I don\u2019t really use the characters as inspiration. Actually walking in the footsteps of any of the characters on these\u2014or indeed, most \u201cprestige\u201d shows these days\u2014would end in disaster.\n\nCardona says that\u2019s too limiting a way to think about this style of therapy. It\u2019s not \u201cwhatever that character did, go do it,\u201d he says. Instead, the reasons a show resonates with you might provide clues to buried emotions that you struggle to verbalize. Scarlet suggests that some of the less-admirable figures from comic books\u2014think the Punisher or the Joker\u2014might even represent parts of us that have a desire for justice or retribution. You don\u2019t have to act like the Joker to feel like a down-on-your-luck outcast.\n\nThese explanations first struck me as too blindly faithful in the power of fictional narratives. Fandom, after all, can have its dark sides, with fans deifying their heroes, harassing detractors, and throwing fits when a character is cast as a person of a different race. What\u2019s more, I was starting to get the impression that anything you\u2019re into could be used to help you achieve anything you want. It almost seemed like superhero therapy could be everything and nothing. At points in my interviews with the geek therapists, I wanted to scream, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2019Nam, there are rules!\u201d\u2014then I realized I was, in fact, quoting one of my favorite movies.\n\nThe thing is, therapy does put a lot of stock in narratives. Therapy is mostly stories. It\u2019s rehashing that one time from your childhood, and then that one conversation with your boss, and then trying to make sense of it all through narratives. In that way, superhero therapy, while not perfect for everyone, is a valid way of coming up with better stories for your life.\n\nAnd sometimes you need every possible implement on earth\u2014no matter how vague or fictional or silly\u2014to do that. Do I want to be just like Succession\u2019s Shiv Roy, a sociopathic adultress who witness tampers? Not really. But when I\u2019m facing a situation that\u2019s so twisted and daunting that it\u2019s going to take all of my competence and persistence and jumpsuits to get through it, I do want to be a little like her. In those moments, she\u2019s my hero.", "description": "Some therapists are telling clients to think like their favorite movie characters.
