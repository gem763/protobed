Then they watch videos of their performances.\n\nIt\u2019s not that much different for musicians, particularly the husband/wife country duo of Shannon Haley and Ryan Michaels.\n\nTheir big play occurred in Levi\u2019s Stadium, home of their longtime favorite team, the 49ers. What could be better than shooting a music video for your new single, \u201cHail Mary,\u201d on your team\u2019s field - and produced by that team, as well?\n\n\u201cWe wrote it about the time we were struggling in the music business and in our lives, and felt like, being huge football fans, we were at the point of the game when you threw a Hail Mary,\u201d Haley says. \u201cThat is where we were in our lives.\n\n\u201cWe had this insane idea and dream that if we get in touch with the 49ers, they will be open to listen to us.\u201d\n\nThey were. Niners vice president Rob Alberino reached out and wound up not only directing and producing the video, but inviting Haley & Michaels to perform at halftime of the Monday night game with Cleveland on Oct. 7.\n\n\u201cWorking on high-level productions like the shoot that occurred at Levi\u2019s Stadium is something our production team looks forward to,\u201d he says. \u201cAnytime you can turn a world-class venue into a stage while a band like Haley & Michaels puts on a show, the final piece is amazing and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d\n\nNowhere would be more fitting for the couple than Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\nHaley grew up in Los Altos, California, and though her mother\u2019s side of the family rooted for the Packers, her dad was all 49ers. She would spend weekends with her father \u201cwatching football all day,\u201d then re-watch the games. She even went to elementary school with one of Joe Montana\u2019s daughters.\n\nMichaels was raised in Palo Alto, and was a standout in soccer who even played in an international tournament. He was most struck by the \u201cclass\u201d the Niners showed under Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh and his two Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Montana and Steve Young. To Michaels, the way the team reacted in defeat was as impressive as how they celebrated all those Super Bowls.\n\nSo the duo had a natural connection before they hooked up in music - and in life.\n\nNow, as they try to make their way in a business as competitive as the NFL - recently opening for megastar Jason Aldean was a major step - Haley & Michaels are getting support from the team they\u2019ve supported most of their lives.\n\n\u201cWe finally are with Sony ATV (on the new label Hickory Records/RED Music) in a record deal and getting our first real shot at radio,\u201d Michael says. \u201cSo we told the 49ers, \u2018Anything you guys can do, it would be amazing to be part of it.\u2019 They came back and offered not only play for us to play \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 at halftime on \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 against the Browns, but Rob had also the idea to direct the music video.\u201d\n\nThe couple went back to Levi\u2019s Stadium, where the fog machine was in full use, their names and logo were on the video, and did 40 takes for the video.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything you could want with the 49ers and the song, and now we can retire,\u201d Michaels says as he and his wife break out in laughter.\n\nClearly, they have much more to shoot for, on the stage and, they hope, on the Niners\u2019 field.\n\n\u201cWe will always try to bring the football team into our career,\u201d Haley says. \u201cIt was one of my favorite moments in my whole life. They had jerseys made up for us. They heard our music and \u2018Hail Mary,\u2019 and wondered how they could support us as we shared our love for the 49ers.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NFL players' dreams usually center on scoring touchdowns and making game-saving tackles.
