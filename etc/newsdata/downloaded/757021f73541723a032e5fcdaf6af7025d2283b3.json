California lawmakers slam utility amid widespread power outage", "language": "en", "text": "Many businesses in Anderson were closed on Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019, due to the PG&E power outage. The Papa Murphy's has a sign on its door reminding customers.\n\nEditor's note: This story is free to all readers as a public service. Please consider subscribing to support local news.\n\nHomes and businesses across California went dark on Wednesday as utilities shut off power to millions of customers in preparation for hot, dry wind expected to tear across the state.\n\nNot even one year out from the deadly infernos sparked by PG&E equipment during similar weather conditions in Paradise, Calif., public officials acknowledged that the massive blackout as a necessary precaution \u2014 but rebuked the utility for not taking the proper safety steps to avoid it ahead of time.\n\n\u201cThe potential for fire danger is serious and people must be prepared,\u201d state Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, said in a statement provided to USA TODAY, adding that the enormous scope of the outages suggests that \u201cPG&E clearly hasn\u2019t made its system safe.\u201d\n\nAs the chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Subcommittee on Gas, Electric and Transportation Safety, Hill held a hearing in August to ensure the state\u2019s Public Safety Power Shutoff program would only be utilized as an extreme and temporary safety tactic, rather than a go-to response.\n\n\u201cThese shutdowns are supposed to be surgical. Shutdowns that could impact as many as 800,000 people in 34 of our 58 counties are by no means surgical,\u201d he said, calling on PG&E to make its system more resilient and safe.\n\n.@PGE4Me will be shutting off power all throughout the Bay Area and Nor Cal. This is the result of decades of underinvestment in maintenance and cannot become the new normal. The power shut-offs will have a huge impact on small businesses and their communities. https://t.co/RIA9KaybKj \u2014 Phil Ting (@PhilTing) October 9, 2019\n\nOthers took issue with the apparent lack of preparation on the part of PG&E to ensure enough resources were ready to inform concerned customers across the wide range of affected areas. As the outage loomed, the utility\u2019s website shut down after being flooded with traffic, leaving many left to wonder if they would wake up without power.\n\n\u201cWe are in the thick of it now. The state is 100% focused on getting through this event,\u201d said state Sen. Mike McGuire, a Democrat who represents the North Bay from Marin County to Del Norte County.\n\nMcGuire added that though the state is prioritizing the mobilization of resources to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable members of the community are being met during the power outage, lawmakers would make sure culpability comes next.\n\n\u201cThe corporation has lacked some basic fundamentals to be able to execute such a large and challenging event,\u201d he said, specifically citing PG&E\u2019s website shortcomings.\n\n\u201cBelieve you me, the time for accountability will come in the next few weeks,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cWe are not missing a beat.\u201d\n\nLawmakers also charged that the company is lagging on its other fire prevention goals.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the impact of this massive rolling blackout, affecting 2.5 million people. People rely on electricity for their medicine, their food & their livelihoods. This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs. We can\u2019t let PG&E normalize these mass blackouts. https://t.co/H8DYpplwRi \u2014 Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cFor years PG&E has done a poor job on maintenance and tree clearing, and they\u2019re still not even close to where they need to be,\u201d state Sen. Bill Dodd of Napa said in a statement. While the Democrat added that public safety power shutoffs are needed under dire circumstances, he added that his constituents are frustrated that their power was terminated before the winds hit the North Bay.\n\n\u201cSadly, poor performance by PG&E is par for the course, so it\u2019s not surprising.\u201d\n\nAn imperfect solution\n\nLocal leaders also were up in arms as they prepared their communities for the prolonged power outage.\n\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that \u201cthis is the type of interruption to lives that should not happen\u201d and emphasized that PG&E could have done more to prevent it.\n\n\"We are going to do it because we agree it is in the interest of the safety of people, but we have got to do better,\" she said.\n\nThere are numerous risks that come with long outages, especially to those who rely on power for medical devices or building access. Non-working intersection lights also increase accident risk. A study released in 2012 found that for an excessively long blackout in New York City, mortality increased by 28% resulting in 90 excess deaths.", "description": "As millions in California lose power during a fire-prevention blackout, lawmakers charge that PG&E; didn't take proper safety steps ahead of time.", "authors": ["Gabrielle Canon", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gVmvVWETiW2CP4qF0KGv6w--~B/aD0xNTM2O3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/0d6c67d0782b44a8f324143655c2fd5b", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
