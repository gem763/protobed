We had been looking online on Redfin and Zillow for at least six months, but after we met with a lender and a real estate agent, we made an offer within a month.\u201d\n\nFernandes, 32, works in the auto industry in Herndon, Va., and his wife, Nicole Fernandes, 33, works in medical billing in Ashburn. The couple, whose budget was around $400,000, purchased a townhouse in Leesburg with a two-car garage.\n\n\u201cOur total mortgage payment is only about $200 more than we were paying in rent,\u201d Gon\u00e7alo Fernandes says. \u201cWe had saved enough for a 12 percent down payment, but we were a little paranoid as first-time buyers and wanted to keep as much as we could in cash reserves.\u201d\n\n\n\nDrew Lytle for The Washington Post (Drew Lytle for The Washington Post )\n\nThe couple made a down payment of 5 percent with a conventional loan geared toward first-time buyers. They pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) on the loan, required on most purchases made with a down payment of less than 20 percent.\n\n\u201cWe bought a fixer-upper and have already done some work on it and we got a good price on the house since it was on the market for a while,\u201d Fernandes says. \u201cWe\u2019re having it appraised in a few months because we may be able to get rid of our PMI already.\u201d\n\nThe Fernandeses used YouTube videos to teach themselves how to do home improvement projects and painted their kitchen cabinets.\n\n\u201cThe house was in good shape, but it was covered in a serious case of ugly,\u201d Fernandes says. \u201cWe negotiated with the seller to pay us the value of the repairs that were needed, such as replacing the water heater, patching the roof and resealing some windows. We took that money as a credit toward closing costs so we could keep as much cash as possible to use for reserves and repairs.\u201d\n\nThe Fernandeses were able to buy their home by saving, negotiating and accepting a home that needed a little work. Other first-time buyers have reached their goal through help from family members and home buyer assistance programs.\n\n\n\nDrew Lytle for The Washington Post (Drew Lytle for The Washington Post)\n\nFactoring in student loans\n\nFirst-time home buyers represented 33 percent of all home purchasers in 2018, according to the National Association of Realtors, and their median age was 32.\n\nAbout 25 percent of buyers received a loan or gift from a family member and 10 percent received financial assistance from a government agency or nonprofit organization, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nWith $67,000 in student loan debt and $50,000 in savings, Rija Tofeeq, a 27-year-old nurse, was torn between wanting to buy a home and paying off her loans. A co-worker told her about the Maryland SmartBuy program, which allows buyers to pay off their student loans with a zero-interest second loan when they use the Maryland Mortgage Program to purchase a home.\n\n\u201cI contacted a lender and learned that if we could qualify for a $275,000 loan we might also qualify to borrow 15 percent of the home value, up to a maximum of $40,000, to pay off my student loans,\u201d Tofeeq says. \u201cMy husband and I had been living with my parents and our 7-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son to save money and to get help with our kids.\u201d\n\nTofeeq\u2019s 33-year-old husband, Sayed Shah, had been finishing his college degree when Tofeeq learned about the program and was about to get a new job.\n\n\u201cWe did the loan entirely in my name and he held off taking a new job until the loan closed because we had to meet the income qualifications for the program,\u201d Tofeeq says. \u201cThe program requires that you pay off all your student loans, so we paid $27,000 on my student loans and another $20,000 as a 5 percent down payment.\u201d\n\nThe couple has now moved into a single-family home in Pasadena, Md. The remaining $40,000 of Tofeeq\u2019s student loans were paid by the lender and Tofeeq has a second loan on her house to cover the repayment. As long as she stays in the home and makes payments on the loan at zero percent interest for five years, the rest of the loan will be forgiven.\n\n\n\nDrew Lytle for The Washington Post (Drew Lytle for The Washington Post)\n\nMaking her dream happen\n\nTwo home buyer programs in the District supported the dream of Yaqueline \u201cJackie\u201d Uribe Perez Clauss, a teacher at Wilson High School in Northwest and a single mother of a 22-year-old, a 17-year-old and a 6-year-old, to buy her first home. Clauss participated in the District\u2019s Inclusionary Zoning program, which offers qualified borrowers the chance to enter a lottery to purchase an affordable home. The program has income limits as well as a requirement to take a home buyer education class.\n\n\u201cI was living in a basement apartment with three kids when I came to D.C. in 2016 and my goal was to buy a house,\u201d Clauss says. \u201cThe inclusionary zoning process was very complicated, but I wasn\u2019t going to let go of my dream even after I didn\u2019t get the house I wanted at first.\u201d\n\nClauss also qualified for $30,000 in down payment and closing-cost assistance through the District\u2019s Home Purchase Assistance Program, which supplemented the $2,000 she had saved on her own. She eventually won the lottery and moved into a house in the Fort Lincoln Park neighborhood in Northeast.\n\nMaria Lynard, a 29-year-old first-time home buyer in Fredericksburg, Va., never stopped living at home with her parents so she could save for a down payment.\n\nFirst-time homeowners Nicole and Gon\u00e7alo Fernandes at their home in Leesburg, Va.

(Jared Soares for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI paid off my car, so my only expenses were my cellphone, gas, car insurance and food,\u201d says Lynard, who works for a remodeling company. \u201cMy real estate agent recommended that I go to George Mason Mortgage for a loan and they told me about homeowner assistance programs for first-time buyers.\u201d\n\nLynard discovered that her income and first-time buyer status qualified her for a $4,000 grant from the Virginia Housing Development Authority to pay for her closing costs.\n\n\u201cAll I needed to do was take a home buyer class online and the grant doesn\u2019t need to be repaid,\u201d Lynard says. \u201cI made a down payment of 8 percent on my house, which is move-in ready so I don\u2019t need to worry about projects.\u201d\n\nLynard paid about $200,000 for her first home.\n\n\n\nDrew Lytle for The Washington Post\n\nInheriting a little help\n\nWhile many first-time buyers get help from their parents with down payment funds, Walker Timme, a 35-year-old teacher at Basis Charter School in the District, received an inheritance when her mother died in 2018 that allowed her to pay cash for her first home.\n\n\u201cIt feels as if my mother is still here in some way because the money she left me is paying for my condo and she would love it,\u201d Timme says. \u201cMy monthly expenses on the condo are just the condo fee, taxes and insurance, which add up to less than I was paying in rent for the studio I\u2019ve lived in for the past 11 years.\u201d\n\nTimme had been \u201crecreationally grazing,\u201d wanting to buy for a year or so, but the inheritance galvanized her to seriously find a condo that met her priorities: a two-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Columbia Heights that allows dogs and is close to a Metro station. Her other must-haves included a front desk for security and a second bedroom for her father to visit her comfortably.\n\nEvery one of these buyers worked with a real estate agent, but Timme also had the support of a lender to understand the financial aspects of buying. Some lenders are particularly passionate about finding assistance or special loans for first-time buyers.\n\n\u201cThere are so many options for first-time buyers through the Maryland Mortgage Program and there are relatively high income limits in many counties,\u201d says Ryan Paquin, branch manager and mortgage consultant with First Home Mortgage in Crofton, Md. He said that in Prince George\u2019s County, for example, there are programs for households with an income of $169,820 as long as there are three or more people living there.\n\nThe SmartBuy program, which helps purchasers pay off their student loan debt, is part of the Maryland Mortgage Program.\n\nPaquin points out that first-time purchasers, for the purposes of buyer assistance programs, are people who haven\u2019t owned a home in the past three years.\n\n\u201cThere are grants that don\u2019t need to be repaid and low- or zero-interest loans that sometimes don\u2019t need to be paid until you sell or refinance,\u201d Paquin says. \u201cLoan programs are out there with low down payment options and debt-to-income ratios as high as 50 percent.\u201d\n\nA debt-to-income ratio compares the minimum monthly payments on all debt, including your mortgage payment, with your gross monthly income. Credit score requirements vary for these programs.\n\n\u201cBefore looking for a home, buyers should have a lender pull their credit because the credit scores people get from free credit score sites or their credit card companies are different than the ones a lender sees,\u201d says Ryan Vitielliss, assistant branch manager at First Home Mortgage.\n\n\n\nDrew Lytle for The Washington Post (Drew Lytle for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018Assemble the right team\u2019\n\nDana Bull, a real estate agent with Sagan Harborside Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in Marblehead, Mass., bought her first house at 22 with a down payment she had saved by working throughout her high school and college years.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important for first-time buyers is to assemble the right team, with a lender, a real estate agent, an attorney and a home inspector to represent their interests,\u201d Bull says. \u201cIt\u2019s also smart to buy something with the worse-case scenario in mind and then figure out how you\u2019ll handle it.\u201d\n\nBull recommends looking for a place that appeals to renters so that the property can become an investment in the future.\n\n\u201cFirst-time buyers would be smart to buy a two-bedroom condo and rent out a bedroom to a roommate so they can afford it more easily,\u201d Bull says. \u201cA two-bedroom is easier to rent and it has a bigger pool of buyers in the future, too.\u201d\n\nAdvice from first-time buyers Start saving early. Research your loan options and home buyer assistance programs. Be flexible with your priorities, but know your nonnegotiable features. Be willing to look past cosmetic flaws. Don\u2019t rely just on photos \u2014 some places look better in person and some look worse. Keep some cash for emergencies and maintenance. Expand your price range a little \u2014 lower and higher \u2014 to see additional properties that you may miss if your range is too narrow. Consider buying a place with space to rent to housemates now and perhaps as an investment property in the future.\n\nSearching for just the right property and managing the financial aspect of a purchase can seem overwhelming to first-time buyers, says Alyssa Cannon, a real estate agent with McEnearney Associates in Arlington, Va.\n\n\u201cI suggest that people break down the process into bite-size steps,\u201d Cannon says. \u201cMeet with an agent and a lender so that you understand the steps and know your financial position. Then look at open houses so you get a better idea of what you like. Eventually, you\u2019ll find a place where you can see yourself living for a long time.\u201d\n\nCannon says it\u2019s fine to look online to get an idea of what\u2019s available, but she thinks seeing properties in person can educate buyers so they understand home values and can explore different neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is to jump in with a lender first because buying your first place isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all proposition,\u201d Paquin says. \u201cA lender can help you come up with a plan that works for you so you can take the plunge and stop wasting money on rent.\u201d", "description": "First-time home buyers represented 33 percent of all home purchasers in 2018.", "authors": ["Michele Lerner"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QHN1ZPoNjzA1xvfjfdJFr06UFEg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HPLAG2VUZFAS5I5WRYEIUYJZWI.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
