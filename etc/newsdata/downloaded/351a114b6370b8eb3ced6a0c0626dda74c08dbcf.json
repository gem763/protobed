REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nJohnson announced on Aug. 28 that he had asked the Queen to prorogue, or suspend, parliament for five weeks from last week until Oct. 14, saying the shutdown was necessary to allow him to introduce a new legislative agenda.\n\nOpponents said the real reason was to prevent scrutiny and challenges by parliament where he now has no majority to his Brexit plans, especially his promise to leave the European Union by Oct. 31 even if no divorce deal has been agreed.\n\nIn a damning judgement, Scotland\u2019s highest court ruled last Wednesday that the suspension was unlawful and was an \u201cegregious\u201d attempt to stymie parliament.\n\nHowever, a week earlier the High Court of England and Wales rejected a similar case, saying the matter was political and not one for judicial interference.\n\nBoth cases are now going before the Supreme Court, the highest judicial body in the United Kingdom, and its 11 judges will give a final ruling on whether Johnson\u2019s advice to the queen was illegal.\n\nSupporters of the legal challenges, a mixture of anti-Brexit campaigners and opposition MPs, want parliament to be immediately recalled if the court backs them. Critics also say that if judges decide Johnson misled the monarch, then he must resign.\n\nJohnson said the current session of parliament was longer than any since the English Civil war in the 17th century, adding that lawmakers would have plenty of time to again discuss Brexit after an EU summit on Oct. 17-18.\n\nWhen asked on Friday if he had misled Elizabeth, Johnson said \u201cAbsolutely not\u201d. \u201cIndeed, as I say, the High Court in England plainly agrees with us, but the Supreme Court will have to decide,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a television interview broadcast on Tuesday, Johnson said he had \u201cthe greatest respect for the judiciary\u201d but declined to say whether he would recall parliament if the ruling goes against the government.\n\n\u201cI think the best thing that I can do is wait and see what the judges say,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland told Sky News: \u201cWe will abide by the ruling of the courts. That is what this government will do and that\u2019s what governments of the past have done because we respect the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative government says opponents of Brexit are using the courts to try to frustrate Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc which was backed by Britons in a 2016 referendum.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled against the government in a similar constitutional case in 2017 when it said ministers could not begin the formal two-year exit process without the approval of parliament.\n\nThat case was led by investment manager Gina Miller, who is one of those taking on the government in the current legal battle along with former Conservative Prime Minister John Major.\n\nThe Supreme Court hearings will run until Thursday, with the verdict not expected until Friday at the earliest.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government will try to persuade Britain's top court this week that his decision to suspend parliament until shortly before the date for Brexit was not illegal as Scottish judges concluded last week.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430759578&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0JQ", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
