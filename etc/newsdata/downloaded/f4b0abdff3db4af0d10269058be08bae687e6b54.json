For the main reason that there will be fewer regulatory hurdles to overcome.\n\nAs part of the study, representatives from 23 banks were asked about CBDCs. More than half of them feared that projects like Facebook\u2018s Libra would undermine monetary sovereignty.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the only firm that\u2019s expecting CBDCs to become a mainstay of our banking future.\n\nEarlier this month, Dutch bank ING published an article speculating that we would see a \u201cfully-fledged central bank digital currency\u201d in the near future.\n\nING\u2019s chief economist Mark Cliffe and its lead economist for digital finance Teunis Brosens said we \u201cmight well see a central bank digital currency emerge within the next five years.\u201d", "description": "ING isn't the only institution that's expecting central bank digital currencies to be a thing quite soon, IBM also says they should be here within 5 years.", "authors": ["Matthew Beedham", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F09%2FIBM-BTC-Yellow-page-blockchain.png&signature=2cebed7b4db06a7edce07be0f6ae1cc7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
