His forthcoming book is \u2018Trumped: Emerging Powers in a Post-American World\u2019\n\nIndia is a key target of the Western liberal media, whose prejudice and ignorance have generated a torrent of negative news coverage aimed at undermining the image of the world\u2019s largest democracy\n\nBiases and lies\n\nThis August, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi revoked special status to improve governance and check Pakistan-sponsored jihadist extremism in Muslim-majority Jammu & Kashmir, Western news outlets pounced on the measure as proof of their preconceived assumption that India was becoming a religiously intolerant Hindu nation in which Muslims (14 percent of India\u2019s population) were believed to be persecuted.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Global Opinions editor slammed Modi\u2019s Kashmir step as \u201cthe darkest moment\u201d and alleged that his \u201canti-Muslim comments and visions\u201d were making India \u201cless democratic and stable, one authoritarian step at a time.\u201d This liberal mainstream American establishment newspaper obviously never cared to know that the same Modi, whose ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) it paints as a fanatical \u2018Hindu nationalist\u2019 outfit, won nine percent of votes from India\u2019s Muslim voters in the 2014 general election and maintained nearly the same level of support from them in the 2019 election.\n\nThe New York Times, another haloed East Coast liberal standard bearer, entertained Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, in a personal meeting with its editorial board and parroted his line that the UN \u201ccan\u2019t ignore Kashmir any more,\u201d and that it should oppose Modi\u2019s \u201cbrutal tightening\u201d of control there. A slew of op-eds and news commentaries followed, mostly hewing to the apocryphal position that India was committing terrible human rights abuses in Kashmir and that Modi\u2019s actions were unconstitutional.\n\nAlso on rt.com Operation Kashmir: Has Modi checkmated Pakistan?\n\nThe Indian government also raised objections regarding the authenticity of uncorroborated videos circulated by the BBC that were meant to show \u201clarge-scale protests\u201d by Kashmiris against India.\n\nWhen India\u2019s Supreme Court was duly considering legal challenges to Modi\u2019s revocation of special status for Kashmir, the doyen of British upper crust liberalism, the Economist, cried foul and declared that the judiciary was \u201cignoring the government\u2019s abuses\u201d and conniving to allow Modi\u2019s fait accompli in Kashmir to stand.\n\nAlthough India has been rated in the Freedom House index as a \u2018fully free\u2019 country with independent institutions and decent civil and political rights (Pakistan, which seeks to annex Kashmir, is rated as \u2018partly free\u2019), it is now a routine phenomenon to see op-eds in Western media pages proclaiming Modi\u2019s India to be on a Hindu supremacist highway to \u2018fascism\u2019. Such wild Western exaggerations echo the baseless criticisms in Islamist media narratives about religious minorities being brutalised or subjected to \u2018genocide\u2019 in India.\n\nDuring the free and fair general election earlier this year, which Modi won hands down by unifying hundreds of millions of voters across religious, caste, and linguistic divides, America\u2019s illustrious Time magazine carried a cover story lambasting him as \u201cIndia\u2019s divider-in-chief\u201d and blaming him for \u201can atmosphere of poisonous religious nationalism.\u201d As a token of editorial balance, an inside commentary in that same edition highlighted positives of Modi\u2019s economic record. But the eyeball effect was deliberately placed on the negative lead item.\n\nBy constantly misrepresenting the reality of India and the intent of Modi\u2019s policies, Western media mavens have attempted to create an illusion to influence Western governments. The damage caused by this motivated campaign was acknowledged by Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who remarked that the \u201cideological\u201d and \u201cstrong preset views\u201d of the Western media made his task harder when he met American policymakers to explain India\u2019s full integration of Jammu & Kashmir and its commitment to counter jihadist terrorism.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018English-speaking liberal media\u2019 biased, covered Kashmir unfairly \u2013 India\u2019s foreign minister\n\nNeo-colonial flop show\n\nNonetheless, if the hope of the Western liberal media establishment was to whip up global alarm by manufacturing an artificial humanitarian crisis in Kashmir and convincing the Donald Trump administration in America and European bigwigs to intervene and pressurise India to back down, it failed miserably.\n\nIndia used informational, diplomatic and economic levers to rebut the Western left-liberal and Islamist propaganda and blunted Pakistan\u2019s efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue. Three central global forums \u2014 the UN Security Council, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly \u2014 refused to heed the Western liberal media\u2019s crusade since August to censure and sanction India over Kashmir.\n\nBy September, Imran Khan was left lamenting that\u201cthe world has not done anything (on the Kashmir issue) because India has a huge market (of) 1.2 billion people.\u201d It was a reality check for the Western liberal opinion-making factories about how much influence they exert in today\u2019s world.\n\nWhen an American president calls them out daily for \u2018fake news\u2019 and a British prime minister himself is found by the judiciary to be in violation of his country\u2019s constitution, the moral high ground and holier-than-thou priggishness of the Western liberal cognoscenti rests on thin ice. They blow the usual hot air to their captive audiences, but lack the power to bend countries like India to their will. The intellectual hegemony of the Western press corps is a bygone.\n\nAlso on rt.com Islamabad accused of brainwashing kids over student body\u2019s VIDEO on how \u2018Hind will become Pakistan\u2019\n\nElitist plot\n\nIn spite of the extremely low credibility of the Western media, the fact that big names in this fraternity print and broadcast across multiple continents to millions of readers and viewers is undeniable. India could not afford to shrug off the Western media assault as harmless noise. It had to strenuously beat it back. And the tussle is far from over.\n\nNationalistic Indians are outraged about the free rein that foreign news media journos have to operate in a democracy like India and carry on tarnishing the host country\u2019s image. The presumption that Western media moguls know which domestic and foreign policies are best for India is so patronising and elitist that it has been rejected by Indians who abhor external intervention in their sovereign affairs.\n\nThe Trojan Horses\n\nTo cover up its neo-imperial nature, the Western news establishment has promoted a familiar set of writers and intellectuals who are of ethnic Indian origin to attack India through its platforms. A sharp rebuke of Modi appearing on the Wall Street Journal or CNN from a left-liberal Indian-sounding writer or pundit is the brown equivalent of Uncle Toms who make careers in the West by betraying their community.\n\nEven the sources which Western journalists have in India while filing news stories are questionable. Western correspondents often seek out India\u2019s left-liberal activists or intellectuals allied with opposition parties who hold deep grudges against Modi, and magnify their viewpoints to foreign audiences. In Jammu & Kashmir, the go-to voices for Western journalists are separatist politicians and anti-India radicals. Sober nationalistic Indians, who constitute the vast majority in the country, are rarely consulted or cited.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018This water belongs to our farmers\u2019: Modi vows not a single drop of Indian water will flow to Pakistan\n\nThe civilising mission\n\nThe result is a barrage of reportage in the West that purposefully villainises Modi and deflates his vision. In today\u2019s transformed world, even if no Western official or government resents India\u2019s rise, the so-called \u2018free\u2019 Western news industry remains supremely sceptical and cynical of India\u2019s viability as one nation and its future progress.\n\nThe sight of a developing nation like India growing powerful and respected under a nationalistic politician like Modi is insufferable to the Western liberal media, which detests the success of alternative pathways to its Euro-centric precepts of individualism, multiculturalism and the superiority of Western civilisation. So, the tirades will keep coming from New York, Washington and London. New Delhi has to prepare for a long and smart ideological resistance.\n\nLike this story?
