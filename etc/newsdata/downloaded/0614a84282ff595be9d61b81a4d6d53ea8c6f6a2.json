She had others, but she used the best ones for her skirt.\n\nKirby was literally wearing her failures, and it was cathartic.\n\nAD\n\nThe skirt communicated what her presentation didn\u2019t: the grueling, bumpy process she went through on her way to her major moment in front of a committee of five professors on Oct. 7.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe dissertation presentation is in this narrative form, where \u2026 it looks like everything went smoothly in my process from start to finish,\u201d said Kirby, 28, who for the past 4\u00bd years has been a doctoral student in environmental science and policy. \u201cSo I wanted something in my presentation that shows that really isn\u2019t how it goes. There are a lot of roadblocks along the way.\u201d\n\nBoth the audience and her professors loved it. The professors chuckled at her ingenuity and bravery. She was grateful for that, and even more so that they accepted her dissertation, which examines how people and organizations make decisions about the environment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt definitely resonated with people more than I expected,\u201d Kirby said about her outfit.\n\nKirby\u2019s adviser, Julie Libarkin, who heads the school\u2019s Geocognition Research Laboratory, found the paper skirt clever and educational.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI thought it was perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt fits our lab culture really well, and Caitlin is delightful. She embraces trying and failing and trying until you achieve a success \u2014 which is sort of what we do in the lab. It\u2019s all about failure.\u201d\n\nLibarkin added: \u201cScience is all about going in directions that turn out to be dead ends and then having to turn around and start over.\u201d\n\nKirby, who lives in Lansing, Mich., and grew up near Kalamazoo, got the idea for the skirt after seeing photos of people at graduation wearing dresses made out of posters they made and accumulated during their PhD work.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSomewhere along the way, I decided that doing the rejection letters would be an interesting twist on that,\u201d said Kirby, who received her undergraduate degree in environmental biology from Michigan State in 2013.\n\nAD\n\nThe show \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d also inspired Kirby: Character Leslie Knope made a wedding dress out of paper articles written about her.\n\nKirby gathered her electronic rejection letters by searching in her email for the words \u201cunfortunately\u201d and \u201cregret\u201d \u2014 words she knew would be in messages telling her she didn\u2019t make the cut. Her search turned up about 25 rejections from places such as the University of Colorado, the National Science Foundation and the journal Agriculture and Human Values. She printed them out and used 17 of them for her project.\n\nAD\n\nTo construct the skirt, she made accordion folds in the letters and punched holes at the top, then strung them together with white ribbon. She attached the ribbon to the white tulle, and reinforced the punched holes with packing tape in the two-tier skirt, which she could only wear while standing up. She drove to her presentation wearing jeans and a T-shirt, and once she got there, she went to a bathroom and slipped on her black-and-white skirt. She paired it with a red ribbon, a gray top, a black blazer and black shoes.\n\nAD\n\nKirby said the creative project felt like a curative way to handle her many rejections. And it also struck her as funny.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m totally okay with all rejections now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still just as painful when it comes across through my email. \u2026 But sitting down and spending time with your rejection letters to make a craft out of them is kind of therapeutic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome of the letters, she said, stung more than others.\n\n\u201cBut when I put them together, they didn\u2019t really seem as painful anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a bonus, she posted a photo of her skirt on Twitter with an explanation, and it was much celebrated, getting about 23,000 likes.\n\nSuccessfully defended my PhD dissertation today! In the spirit of acknowledging & normalizing failure in the process, I defended in a skirt made of rejection letters from the course of my PhD. #AcademicTwitter #AcademicChatter #PhDone\n\nTHANK YOU to everyone involved in my journey pic.twitter.com/FQbXYQ1Oov \u2014 Caitlin K. Kirby (@kirbycai) October 7, 2019\n\nLike a wedding dress, the paper skirt is pretty much a wear-once clothing item. But, Kirby said, Halloween is coming up \u2014 so, she may just make a scary costume out of the skirt, perhaps by pairing it with a shirt that says \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn January, Kirby leaves for the final stage of her doctoral degree. She will be spending about eight months in Dortmund, Germany, working at the Research Institute for Urban and Regional Development. She received a Fulbright Scholar grant for the project.\n\nAD\n\nKirby has been preparing by learning German for the past year. When she finishes her European stint and her PhD becomes official, Kirby intends to return to the United States, most likely to the Midwest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a lot more rejection letters between now and then,\u201d she joked.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "She was literally wearing her failures, and it was cathartic.", "authors": ["Kellie B.
