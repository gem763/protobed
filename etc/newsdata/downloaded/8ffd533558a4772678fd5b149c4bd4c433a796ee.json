Like Enos Tilghman, he worked for one of Philadelphia\u2019s many black chimney sweep masters. Where the archives run thin, Bell responsibly imagines what these two boys\u2019 interior lives might have been like, and how they might have been kidnapped. Perhaps, like many young black chimney sweepers, Enos and Joe spent \u201chours fantasizing about the fun they would have had when the workday was done.\u201d Perhaps they planned on going down to the docks of the Delaware River after work, where many black children went to let off steam. Or perhaps they were impoverished, hungry, and hard-working enough that they \u201cjump[ed] at a stranger\u2019s invitation to earn twenty-five cents\u201d carrying some fruit to a small vessel nearby.\n\nThat the man who offered these boys some work was black might seem surprising. But the most compelling aspect of Stolen is how Bell handles these seeming oddities. Black accomplices like John Purnell, the initial kidnapper, were not uncommon. Like most un-enslaved black people, they had few employment options, and the pay offered by kidnapping ringleaders\u2014who were almost always white\u2014could be immensely appealing. Purnell once bragged that he could make \u201cfrom fifty to an hundred dollars in a Week\u201d kidnapping black people, which would have been between five and ten times the amount he might have earned chopping wood or pushing a handcart. White kidnapping ringleaders often preyed on vulnerable black men because they could blend into black neighborhoods and lure their victims without raising the mistrust that a nice-seeming white man might. Black parents had been having \u201cthe talk\u201d with their kids long before modern-day police brutality: In the era of slavery, un-enslaved black parents \u201cregularly pleaded with their children to be on the lookout for white \u2018Georgia-men\u2019,\u201d Bell writes, referring to white kidnappers. If some parents forgot to tell their children to be wary of nice-seeming black men too, it was understandable.\n\nBell is equally convincing when explaining other apparent anomalies. Why would a white plantation owner, John Hamilton, sue the kidnappers from whom he unwittingly bought Scomp? Bell shows that, in fact, southern slaveholders frequently sued illegal slave traders. It had nothing to do with their opposition to slavery, and everything to do with their desire to protect the image of slavery. By aggressively prosecuting the illegal slave trade\u2014and publicizing their role fighting on behalf of illegally enslaved black people\u2014they could show white northerners that slavery was not the lawless, flesh-consuming racket that abolitionists said it was. In addition, they might encourage civic leaders in free northern cities just across the border to return fugitives.\n\nBut black communities had a way of unsettling the plans of city elders. Northern black community leaders and abolitionists would insist that illegally kidnapping un-enslaved black people was no different than legal slavery. As the abolitionist George Bourne wrote in 1834: \u201cHe who claims a coloured child as his property, and nurtures and detains it in slavery, is equally a man-thief with the negro-stealer.\u201d By the 1850s, the term \u201cman-stealing,\u201d which initially referred only to kidnapping, became a common slur for all slaveholders. Bell credits activism against kidnapping for helping to push the nation into a war over slavery. But he also underscores that there was no justice for the five kidnapped boys. The four who survived may have been freed, but only two of their kidnappers had been captured and imprisoned. The convicted were also the lowest on the totem pole: a white boat crewmember, and John Purnell, the black accomplice. The ring-leaders\u2014Ebenezer and Sally, and their larger family, which for decades ran one of the nation\u2019s largest kidnapping cartels\u2014were never caught.\n\nThe question of justice\u2014what\u2019s owed not only to those illegally kidnapped, but to all the enslaved, and to all black people today burdened by the legacy of slavery\u2014is at the center of McDaniel\u2019s Sweet Taste of Liberty. In the story of Henrietta Wood\u2014who was kidnapped in Cincinnati in 1853, after being legally un-enslaved for five years\u2014McDaniel sees an overlooked and early example of reparations. Like Scomp, Wood took the extraordinary risk of telling her story to a white inn-keeper she had met while being taken to her new owner in Mississippi. The man relayed her message to sympathetic white lawyers in Kentucky, a slave state, who filed a suit on her behalf. Though the case took nearly 25 years to conclude, Wood succeeded in extracting $2,500 from her original kidnapper. It was a fraction of the $20,000 she had sued for, but it was enough to help her son, Arthur Simms, attend law school and buy a home in Chicago\u2014enough, that is, to the improve his life chances. Perhaps it was not that elusive thing we call justice, but it was, McDaniel suggests, something tangible and consequential.\n\nWood was another victim of what Bell calls the Reverse Underground Railroad. As in Stolen, McDaniel expertly recovers her obscure life from diffuse archival fragments. Born into slavery in Kentucky, around 1818, Wood received her freedom papers in 1848. That year, her owner, a white woman named Jane Cirode, took her across the Ohio River into Cincinnati and freed her. You might think she did so out of moral opposition to slavery, but McDaniel is particularly good at challenging assumptions. Cirode legally freed Wood not because she opposed slavery\u2014in fact, she rented Wood out to other enslavers for years before freeing her. Rather, she freed her because she had gotten wind that her husband\u2019s creditors might seize Wood. By legally freeing Wood, Cirode could still pressure Wood into working for her as a domestic laborer. After all, what other options did she have? \u201cProbably nine out of ten\u201d un-enslaved black women in Cincinnati worked as a domestic laborers, McDaniel writes, virtually their only means of employment. Cirode provided Wood with room and board, but, as Wood later recalled, Cirode only \u201cgave me a little money from time to time.\u201d This was freedom.\n\nWard\u2019s full-time career was not as a kidnapper, but as the head of several state prison systems, first in Kentucky, and after the Civil War, in Arkansas.\n\nWood eventually found work with another white woman. But not long after she changed employers, she was kidnapped by a white man named Zebulon Ward and sold to Gerard Brandon, a Mississippi cotton planter. One of the largest slaveowners in the nation\u2014he owned nearly 700 enslaved people\u2014Brandon kept her enslaved until the very end of the Civil War. During her re-enslavement, she also became pregnant with Arthur Simms, who was likely conceived through rape. McDaniel spends considerable space exploring Ward\u2019s life, and not only because Wood successfully sued him. His story is also meant to resonate with mass incarceration today: Ward\u2019s full-time career was not as a kidnapper, but as the head of several state prison systems, first in Kentucky, and after the Civil War, in Arkansas. Ward could afford to fight Wood\u2019s lawsuits for decades in part because he was amassing a fortune renting out black prisoners. Postwar southern laws were designed to target and imprison black people, often for petty or invented offenses, and by the 1870s, for the first time in our nation\u2019s history, many prisons became overwhelmingly black. In turn, Ward and others like him pioneered the convict-leasing system, which allowed them to rent out black prisoners and keep the profit for themselves\u2014\u201cslavery by another name,\u201d as it is often called.\n\nBy the time Ward was ordered to pay $2,500 to Wood in 1878, he could laugh it off as a pittance. Even Wood demanded a new trial. But by tracing the impact those $2,500 had on her son\u2019s life, McDaniel wants us to think hard about the real benefits that financial reparations might have. He knows full well that financial payouts to the descendants of slaves is only one meaning of reparations. He also knows that there are reasonable arguments against it: For instance, might financial pay-outs\u2014and potentially meager ones\u2014give white Americans an excuse not to address the tangled knot of racist policies, laws, behaviors, and attitudes that we call systemic racism? Even if the overwhelming majority of black Americans today could, because their ancestors were enslaved, make a claim for remuneration, would that be justice for the significant minority of black people who are not the descendants of slaves, but who are forced to live in a racist society, one that slavery created? And would any kind of reparations, financial or otherwise, be justice at all?\n\nMcDaniel acknowledges the dangers of a \u201ca cheap payoff.\u201d But he wants us to consider the weakness of the counter-argument, the one that would have us accept \u201capologies without paychecks,\u201d as he recently wrote in the New York Times. In any case, by acknowledging the inability of reparations to achieve justice, we might actually strengthen, rather than weaken, the case for them. As the scholars Saidiya Hartman and Stephen Best have written: \u201cIf what has been done cannot be undone, then the forms of legal and social compensation available are less a matter of wiping the slate clean than of embracing the limited scope of the possible in the face of the irreparable.\u201d The limited scope of the possible in the face of the irreparable\u2014that is what reparations ought to be after.\n\nSlavery was a 400-year human atrocity for which there is no material remedy. It destroyed the lives of untold millions. It forged our nation, indeed many nations, and it forged not only black people, but white people, too. Because slavery made race\u2014an indelible feature of our nation\u2014it is something that we can never put behind us, nor something that we might ever want to put behind us. Like any historical fact, it must be lived with and accepted. Its most pernicious legacy\u2014racism\u2014most certainly can be overcome, or at least contained and diminished, but what created it will always remain. We should therefore avoid thinking of reparations as an attempt at \u201cwiping the slate clean.\u201d We might then see them as meaningful and consequential, and in the way that they were for Henrietta Wood\u2019s son Arthur, and all of his descendants.", "description": "Two new books tell the stories of people kidnapped and sold into slavery.
