In that scenario, an EU tariff would be applied.", "description": "Boris Johnson has secured some key changes to the controversial Irish backstop, which he previously warned no prime minister could accept.", "authors": ["James Rothwell", "Brexit Correspondent", "Tom Harris", "Janet Daley", "Liam Halligan", "Sajid Javid"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000211466158-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
