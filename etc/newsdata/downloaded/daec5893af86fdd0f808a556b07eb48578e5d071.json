It turns out that might cost you.\n\nStudies have shown that managers typically give preferential treatment to those who are close to them or share something in common, like a group identity.\n\nBut now researchers say there\u2019s a situation where it\u2019s bad to be the boss\u2019s friend. When managers are handing out bonuses\u2014and when employees will know who gets the rewards\u2014the bosses want to avoid the appearance of bias. So, they often pass over their pals and favor other workers.\n\n\u201cPeople want to be fair, and they also want to help out their friends,\u201d says researcher Alex Shaw, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Chicago. \u201cBut the role of a manager is to be impartial, rewarding workers based on their efforts, and these two tendencies can conflict in the office when you\u2019re supposed to avoid favoritism.\u201d\n\nVirtual connections\n\nIn a recent study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Dr. Shaw and a team of researchers created eight virtual office situations where 1,200 online participants surveyed through Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, a platform often employed by psychologists, had to decide how to award a bonus or another benefit.\n\nIn these scenarios, participants were asked to imagine being a boss who was tasked with deciding how to assign a bonus to one of two people\u2014a friend or another employee. The bosses could either reward the person based on merit or flip a coin and let fate decide. In some cases they were told the decision would be public, and in other cases private.\n\nThe result? Friends tended to suffer when the decisions were made public. In those cases, bosses rewarded the deserving employee 25% less when that person was their friend. In private, though, bosses tended to reward the slightly more deserving employee at equally high rates, whether the employee was a friend or not.\n\nHowever, there was one case where public decisions did favor friends\u2014when company resources weren\u2019t at stake. \u201cWe found that when bosses are distributing their own resources, like their own personal tickets to \u2018Hamilton,\u2019 they do show preference to their friends,\u201d says Dr. Shaw.\n\nWhy? The survey-takers believed other employees would approve of that decision because \u201cpeople do not generally think it is inappropriate to give more to friends in the interpersonal domain,\u201d says Dr. Shaw, under which something like offering one\u2019s own extra theater tickets falls.\n\nPlaying fair\n\nWhile Dr. Shaw and his team did not study the broader implications of his findings, they do speculate in the paper that reverse bias could apply to many situations. This could include times when academics review friends\u2019 papers, when politicians tackle political issues involving friends, even when coaches are working with their friends\u2019\u2014or their own\u2014children.\n\n\u201cWe also speculate that this may apply to group membership as well,\u201d Dr. Shaw says. \u201cOne could imagine a reporter with liberal politics being worried about appearing biased, so he might be harder on a liberal than a conservative to appear unbiased.\u201d\n\nThere are a few ways bosses can avoid the bias fears regarding friends, he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a position where you can let someone else decide whom to reward, you should recuse yourself,\u201d Dr. Shaw says, adding, \u201cIt can be hard to trust your own judgment in situations where you have conflicting biases.\u201d\n\nAnother strategy is to ask other people\u2019s opinions. Since a public decision to reward a friend might appear partial, as long as many other people agree that this person is deserving, the idea that the leader is practicing favoritism might be diminished.\n\nLast, says Dr. Shaw, if the criteria for making the bonus are explicit, that could help colleagues recognize that the allocation of bonuses is fair. \u201cMake the rules really clear, like saying that the person who produces the most units will get a bonus,\u201d he says. \u201cThat could be useful to mitigate the appearance of favoritism.\u201d\n\nMs Mitchell is a writer in Chicago.
