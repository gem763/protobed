It was awful looking at the (Pool B) table and seeing us there with zero points.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, we are by no means thinking all is well now, we know where we are and what we still have to do.\n\n\u201cNow it is on to Italy, which is almost like a playoff game and we need to win it.\u201d\n\nBATTLE-READY BOKS\n\nEvery member of the Bok squad has had minutes on the pitch in the opening two games and Erasmus believes this is important to make all the players feel part of the tournament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough when you are a group of 31 players and only 23 play in the first one or two big games, and the others have to just be the opposition (in training), holding the tackle bags and trying to be positive all the time,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the Namibia game will have made his fringe players \u2018battle-ready\u2019 should any be called in to face Italy because of injury.\n\n\u201cTactically, we may not have been challenged in this game, but physically we were. A lot of people may point a finger and say it wasn\u2019t a great performance, but for us at least it was a physical challenge.\n\n\u201cNow we have some match fitness and some log points out of this, which means we are a little bit better prepared for Italy next week.\u201d\n\nErasmus was also quick to point to the improvement of many so-called lesser teams in the tournament, including hosts Japan, who stunned Ireland 19-12 in their Pool A match earlier on Saturday.\n\n\u201cTen or 15 years ago, Namibia might have got 100 points (scored against them) in the World Cup, there were a lot of big scores,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJapan conceded 100 points (145-17 versus New Zealand) in the 1995 World Cup, so there is a definite improvement. They are now beating teams like us and Ireland.\u201d", "description": "South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus says a five-point haul and a run-out for his whole squad are the positives from Saturday\u2019s scrappy 57-3 Rugby World Cup Pool B win over Namibia as he turns his attention to a must-win clash with Italy on Friday.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435122735&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S058-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
