REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo\n\nOmara Khan Masoudi, a former director of the National Museum, witnessed the tumultuous period that led to the Soviet occupation, followed by civil war, the Taliban regime and then the still-continuing U.S.-backed war against the insurgents.\n\nMasoudi, 71, achieved success as a custodian of Afghanistan\u2019s historical relics but he feels anguish just before a presidential election. Leaders have failed to be guardians and defenders of the national interest, he said.\n\n\u201cAn election is one of the main exercise of a democratic system but it has lost its meaning in Afghanistan,\u201d Masoudi said at his residence.\n\nDecades of war destroyed people\u2019s lives and holding elections despite the violence is a reminder of Afghans\u2019 ability to withstand adversity, Masoudi said.\n\n\u201cTo risk one\u2019s life for a vote, proves a commitment towards democracy,\u201d said Masoudi, who is now a cultural consultant to UNESCO for Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cI lost hope in the election process when I learnt that it can be easily rigged by politicians. It becomes a wasted effort, but I have to vote to protect my rights,\u201d Masoudi said.\n\nFirst-time voter, Samiullah Mehri, 21, a cricketer based in Kabul who has lived through the U.S.-led war against the Taliban, said he was very excited to take part.\n\nCricket was first adopted by Afghans in the refugee camps of cricket-loving Pakistan, to where more than three million had fled the Soviet invasion and civil war in the 1980s and 1990s. It has since made huge strides in the country, particularly among ethnic Pashtuns in the eastern border provinces.\n\nThe Taliban banned games such as cricket and football in the early years of their austere rule because they believed they kept men away from prayers, but they later became more tolerant of cricket.\n\nFrom there, despite at least two attacks in the past few years on cricket matches claimed by the ultra-radical Islamic State group, the game now rivals football for popularity in a country that has long been cut off from the international sport.\n\n\u201cI am a bit afraid of the security situation, especially after the Taliban warned people to not take part in the election, but I can\u2019t wait to cast my vote,\u201d Mehri said.\n\n\u201cElections brings a sense of continuity to our development. For me personally it means that we will have a better life and we will create new opportunities.\u201d", "description": "Nearly two decades ago, an Afghan man risked his life to protect the country's prized artefacts by hiding them in the basement of the central bank office in Kabul as Taliban Islamists destroyed the capital's museum.", "authors": ["Abdul Qadir Sediqi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434510402&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0S2", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
