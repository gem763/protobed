Many mainstream media outlets said the drug plan would save Medicare $345 billion. Wow.\n\nHowever, each breathless story included the phrase \u201caccording to the Congressional Budget Office.\u201d Well, that\u2019s a horse of a different color.\n\nYou see, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does not have what one would call a stellar track record on health care cost projections. So a news consumer should ask: \u201cHow likely is it that the CBO is correct about saving $345 billion in Medicare funding for our seniors?\u201d The answer? Not very.\n\nHOUSE SPEAKER PELOSI UNVEILS NEW PLAN TO LOWER DRUG PRICES\n\nLet\u2019s refer back to a few of CBO\u2019s health care greatest hits. The CBO predicted \u2013 or \u201cscored\u201d \u2013 various aspects of the Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare. CBO wasn\u2019t just wrong, it was consistently wrong \u2013 with some predictions that were too high and some that were too low \u2013 on an epic scale.\n\nFor example, in its final projection just before the ObamaCare private exchanges actually went live, CBO predicted that enrollment through the exchanges would total about 22 million individuals by 2016. Actual enrollment was around 10 million. Oops.\n\nIn 2015, CBO predicted that enrollment through the exchanges would double between 2015 and 2016. Wrong again \u2013 almost zero change occurred.\n\nn 2014, CBO estimated that ObamaCare\u2019s \u201crisk corridor\u201d program to subsidize private insurers on the exchanges would net a positive $8 billion annually for federal coffers. But by 2015, actual losses to the feds reached $5.8 billion.\n\nHow about Medicaid expansion? There the CBO was 50 percent off. That is, over 50 percent more individuals enrolled under Medicaid expansion than predicted. Not only that, the cost per enrollee was $6,366 per year \u2013 49 percent higher than CBO\u2019s guesstimate.\n\nWhat else did CBO get wrong? According to the Hudson Institute, Forbes, Citizens Against Government Waste and others, a lot. How about overall cost? CBO projected the total cost of Medicaid expansion at around $42 billion; the actual cost was 62 percent higher \u2013 about $68 billion.\n\nCBO\u2019s based its overall budget projections on an expected gross domestic product growth rate of 3.2 percent annually. That seemed safe, since the recovery under President Ronald Reagan after a major recession averaged 4.6 percent,\n\nBut President Barack Obama\u2019s regimen of stifling taxes and strangulating regulations yielded a paltry 2.1 percent annual \u201crecovery\u201d -- the worst in modern times. That put CBO\u2019s predicted budget impact way off, again by about half.\n\nSo please forgive my jaundiced reaction to news reports that the CBO predicts $345 billion in Medicare savings from Nancy Pelosi\u2019s new federal takeover of the pharmaceutical industry. If the past is prologue, and it is, CBO\u2019s assurances are of little value.\n\nAdd to my fiscal skepticism the other, non-fiscal, impacts of Pelosi\u2019s \u201coffer you can\u2019t refuse.\u201d The plan features a confiscatory 95 percent tax on sales if manufacturers fail to acquiesce to the government\u2019s \u201cgun to the head\u201d negotiation demands.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe plan also includes price controls tied to foreign socialist systems \u2013 a sure way to hike costs and slash supply. It will also kill new drug development, the lifeblood of the American drug industry.\n\nEven worse is that Pelosi has targeted Medicare Part D, the one massive government program that even critics (like me) will grudgingly admit has exceeded expectations.\n\nThe program produces savings and high customer satisfaction through market-oriented practices. Pelosi\u2019s response? If it ain\u2019t broke, let\u2019s break it so we can claim credit for the fix!\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe biggest problem dogging drug prices in this country is counterproductive government regulations. The solution Democrats offer? Let\u2019s double down on counterproductive government regulations!\n\nIt makes about as much sense as anything else coming from a rudderless, desperate Democratic Party that is approaching 2020 with a growing sense of dread.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JASON CHAFFETZ", "description": "Nancy Pelosi's legislation to lower drug prices is based on counterproductive government regulations.", "authors": ["Jason Chaffetz", "Jason Chaffetz Is A Fox News Contributor Who Was The Chairman Of The U.S. House Oversight Committee When He Served As A Representative Utah.
