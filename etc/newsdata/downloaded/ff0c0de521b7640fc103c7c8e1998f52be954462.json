But at the moment I am going to focus and engage as much as I possibly can within the Vietnamese community,\u201d Pasmore said.\n\nPeople from a rural region in central Vietnam have said they fear friends and relatives seeking to move to Britain make up a large number of the dead, who were found in an industrial park around 20 miles east of London.\n\nThe truck driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and three others are being held on suspicion of human trafficking and manslaughter.\n\nIrish police on Saturday said they had arrested a fifth person in connection with the investigation.\n\nPasmore, who is in charge of identifying the bodies but not running the criminal investigation, said his colleagues were keeping an open mind about whether the dead were victims of a wider human trafficking conspiracy.\n\n\u201cCriminals and murderers are taking more and more chances with these vulnerable people,\u201d he said.\n\nPasmore said he had spoken with Vietnam\u2019s ambassador to Britain to seek assistance with fingerprint records.\n\nPasmore said he had also contacted the operator of a Vietnamese community website and hoped Vietnamese people in Britain would \u201ctake a leap of faith\u201d and help police identify friends and relatives, even if they were in Britain illegally.", "description": "British police want help from the Vietnamese community in Britain and abroad to identify the 39 people found dead in the back of a refrigerated truck on Wednesday, a senior officer said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
