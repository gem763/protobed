He hasn't killed penalties since his time in Ottawa.\n\n'My role's changing'\n\n\"Yea, there is things to learn,\" he said. \"I haven't killed a lot the last few years. Prior to that I killed more, but my role's changing. With changing you have to learn, you have to adapt and you have to get better.\n\n\"I'm going to do all those things and make sure when I get in I'm ready.\"\n\nSpezza, who signed with the Leafs for the NHL minimum US$700,000 to return home July 1, has 915 career points \u2014including 332 goals \u2014 in 1,065 regular-season games with Ottawa and Dallas.\n\nHe's added 70 points (25 goals, 45 assists) in 80 playoff outings.\n\n\"You want to play to open the season, there's no doubt about that,\" Spezza said. \"The competitor in you wants to be in every night, but you play the hand that you're dealt.\n\n\"I'm just going to work and be ready.
