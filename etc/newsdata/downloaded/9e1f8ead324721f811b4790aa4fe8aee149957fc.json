No one should be killed during a wellness check. But the biggest thing is anytime someone has to go through that, the last thing you want to have to worry about is trying to come up with the money for a funeral.\"\n\nThe Barnes' are covering the cost of more than half of the services, and Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Malik Jackson has agreed to pick up the rest of the bills, Lee Merritt, a lawyer for Jefferson's family, told the Dallas Morning News.\n\nBarnes said he has not spoken with Jefferson's family.\n\n\"We're just giving them space respectfully,\" he said.\n\nBarnes also lamented the string of gun violence in the Dallas area and highlighted the death of former NBA player Andre Emmett, who was killed last month.\n\n\"A guy that I played pickup basketball with for 2 1/2 straight summers, another unfortunate incident,\" Barnes said. When you see these types of situations continue to occur, you know that change has to happen.\"", "description": "Harrison Barnes of the Dallas Mavericks and Malik Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles will cover the funeral costs for Atatian Jefferson's family.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published A.M.
