Sure, nippier weather nudges us toward warming foods, but when it\u2019s cold outside and the office kicks its heating system into overdrive, soup might not be the answer. And when there are heaping piles of mashed potatoes, burnished birds and roasted veggies on the table, sometimes a crisp, refreshing bite is exactly what you need.\n\nThen there\u2019s also the fact that the word \u201csalad\u201d has such a varied meaning. They can come with a bed of grains underneath, they can be served warm, and they can even be completely devoid of greens.\n\nTake these recipes as inspiration for assembling a salad featuring the best of autumn.\n\nWarm Endive Salad, above. Have fun tearing slightly bitter lettuces like endive, escarole and radicchio, then dressing the lot with a sticky-savory combination of pancetta, honey, vinegar and ever-so-slightly warmed pear.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nChicory Salad With Roasted Grapes. Roasting grapes takes their sweetness to complex and, frankly, beautiful levels. Especially paired with slightly bitter chicory and funky blue cheese.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nAutumn \u201cColeslaw.\u201d This isn\u2019t like your usual coleslaw, though you can absolutely use it in the same way. Dates, apples and nuts add mild sweetness and autumnal vibes to a heap of shredded red cabbage.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nBeet and Orange Salad. Beets don\u2019t necessarily have the nicest reputation, so we\u2019ll sweeten the deal with fresh oranges and a dollop of creamy yogurt. This makes an excellent starter or small plate.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nRoasted Fennel and Lemon Salad With Turmeric Walnuts. Roasting fennel, the star of this simple salad, tones down some of its licorice flavor and adds little crispy bits. Another simple elevating tweak: Blanching lemon slices eliminates their sharper notes, so you can eat them skin and all.\n\nBrussels Sprouts Caesar Salad. Romaine? Forget it. Quickly blanch half your Brussels sprouts and roast the other half to get two different textures and two layers of flavor. Then, toss with maple bacon, a dreamy Caesar dressing and a hard-cooked egg for the heartiest take on a Caesar salad you\u2019ll ever try.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nGreen Salad With Pears, Pecans and Blue Cheese. It\u2019s so very simple: Toss crunchy-sweet pears, pecans and blue cheese with maple Dijon dressing in this holiday-friendly starter.\n\nAutumn Salad With Farro, Apple and Roasted Persimmon. If you want to try persimmons but are a little intimidated, try roasting them and adding them to this hearty, warm-hued farro salad. Tart bites of apple and pomegranate are a lovely, crunchy bonus to the soft, yielding fruit and grain.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nBring another bundle of joy to new parents with these 7 make-ahead recipes\n\nBake like Mrs. Patmore, eat like the Crawleys with this delightful \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 cake", "description": "We'll keep eating these salads through the colder months.", "authors": ["Kari Sonde", "Editorial Aide For Food", "September At Pm", "Kari Sonde Is The Editorial Aide For The Food Section", "Where She Helps With Recipes", "Cooking Questions", "Food Styling.
