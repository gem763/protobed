The thing is, your body needs protein, right, so if you stop eating protein you\u2019re going to crumble,\u2019 Patrik proceeded to explain to Piers.\n\n\u2018So if there was anything in meat my body needs, it\u2019s been more than a decade since I ate meat for the last time. Nothing in my body\u2026\u2019\n\nPatrik defended his diet (Picture: ITV/Good Morning Britain)\n\n\u2018Your residual strength\u2026\u2019 Piers interrupted.\n\nPatrik replied: \u2018No, not really,\u2019 but the GMB presenter hit back: \u2018For two-thirds of your life you\u2019ve been eating meat.\u2019\n\nAs he went on, Piers challenged the bodybuilder, and TV personality James Wilks, who was also on the show, whether or not there were any strongmen/women who had always been vegan, before he said \u2018no one was a vegan 20 years ago\u2019.\n\nHe had a lot of questions (Picture: ITV/Good Morning Britain)\n\nSusanna Reid, though, his ever balanced co-host, noted with a laugh: \u2018People have been vegan longer than Greggs have been making sausage rolls\u2026\u2019\n\nBefore Patrik mustered up his strength, Piers wanted to continue to challenge his choice of diet, as he suggested a lot of vegans are \u2018aggressive\u2019 in their opinions of the diet and those who alternatively eat meat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Joking apart, I\u2019ve got no problem with people eating whatever diet they want to eat,\u2019 he began. \u2018My only problem is vegans can be aggressive [in telling people].\u2019\n\nAs Patrik lifted up four adults, he exclaimed to Piers: \u2018Are you convinced now?!\n\nWe think he was convinced\u2026for now.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
