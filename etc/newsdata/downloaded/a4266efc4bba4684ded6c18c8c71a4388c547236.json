It could be easy to forget because the two versions of Miles haven\u2019t spent much time together, and many of the episodes have been structured around keeping them apart \u2014 showing a set of events from one perspective, then coming back around to show the other. What\u2019s been a little bit lost is the conversation that Miles is having with himself, which is the benefit and curse of hanging out with your own clone. Miles has learned about himself through his confrontations with Miles 2.0 \u2014 as the more defeated and ill-kempt of the two, he\u2019s had to step up his game a little \u2014 but there hasn\u2019t been much sustained Miles-on-Miles (and Rudd-on-Rudd) action.\n\n\u201cNice Knowing You\u201d finally delivers on that promise, but not before getting sidetracked by the least compelling subplot of the series. It turns out that the two Mileses\u2019 threatened call to the FDA\u2019s criminal division was accidentally a real alert, one that\u2019s had two FDA agents following Miles around in a station wagon. So when Miles was kidnapped at the end of the last episode, he comes face to face with those investigators, who want to get to the bottom of this human cloning operation. Or they might. It\u2019s curious that Miles is treated as if he\u2019s the perpetrator of a crime rather than its beneficiary. They seem to have no interest in going after this network of cloning spas and a keen interest in determining whether Miles is who he says he is. And really, a lie detector test (on defective equipment) wouldn\u2019t reveal anything about whether this is new Miles or original flavor. They share the same memories.\n\nBut these opening minutes press on, pushing the thin joke that Miles is being kept in the FDA\u2019s lactation room rather than a proper holding facility, because there isn\u2019t any money available for cloning probes. This leads to the odd spectacle of Miles plundering the refrigerator for breast milk while working his way through stacks of parenting magazines. The room allows him to refocus on the possibilities of fatherhood after years of withering interest, but it\u2019s a contrived and unfunny situation, made worse by an investigator\u2019s inexplicable line of questioning. (\u201cHave you ever engaged in sodomy?\u201d) When Miles manages to escape the lactation room and wander out into the office area, his release is such a big shoulder-shrug that you wonder why his confinement was necessary at all.\n\n\u201cNice Knowing You\u201d improves when Miles comes back home to find Kate waiting for him on the stairs, ready to confess her shame in cheating on him with his clone. Before she can, however, Miles feels he has some apologizing to do. (His sputtering about reading a parenting article and drinking breast milk is funnier in the telling. \u201cThis is coming out all wrong!\u201d he says in frustration.) After Miles 2.0\u2019s excruciating attempt to coax Kate into re-creating their wedding dance, it\u2019s a huge pleasure to see them cut a rug to Rick James\u2019 \u201cGive It To Me Baby,\u201d falling into step with ease. They are the right couple \u2014 they like pi\u00f1a coladas and getting caught in the rain \u2014 and it\u2019s obvious to them and to Miles 2.0, who\u2019s spying from upstairs. His Miles ruse gets sidelined before it ever gets started. All he gets out of it is toothpaste stains on a ratty sweater.\n\nBack at his apartment, Miles 2.0 contemplates suicide \u2014 though, again, such an extreme act seems out of character, even for a guy who has no purpose. One important thing to note about Miles 2.0\u2019s feelings for Kate is that they\u2019re not as lived-in as his counterpart\u2019s. Just as their years as a couple wind up mattering to Kate more than she anticipated, it follows that Miles 2.0\u2019s memories bring him up short of the deep feeling that she\u2019s a lost soul mate. Miles 2.0 putting a gun in his mouth isn\u2019t convincing, and even he seems to realize that when he can\u2019t pull the trigger. The entire sequence plays like a silly pretext to a physical confrontation between the two Mileses.\n\nOnce Miles and Miles 2.0 finally square off, the metaphysical battle promised with the show\u2019s title bears some fruit. They\u2019re equally incompetent fighters, which leads to some quality slapstick, but the point of the sequence is to bring out their similarities and differences at the same time. It\u2019s a metaphor for the complicated feelings people have about themselves, the self-love and self-hatred that coexists within the same being. They try to murder each other \u2014 and Miles succeeds, briefly \u2014 but they\u2019re united in their hatred of that horrible credenza, and they\u2019re united again when Kate announces her pregnancy and both can serve a unified purpose.\n\nThere may be no children\u2019s book about a baby having two dads and a mom, so it will be the task of next season to see if there\u2019s room for all three to play their part. (Speaking from experience, if the three of them can get together on feeding schedules during those sleepless first few months, it will be a revolution in parenting.) It wouldn\u2019t be a show if this wasn\u2019t a tenuous arrangement, from the issue of paternity to the perpetually unsettled matter of who\u2019s entitled to Miles\u2019 life. But the fundamentals of Living With Yourself \u2014 Rudd\u2019s dual turn, Aisling Bea\u2019s refreshing saltiness, creator Timothy Greenberg\u2019s insight into middle-aged suburban malaise \u2014 are enough to keep it rolling for a while, so long as it doesn\u2019t get sidetracked by the cloning police. Cloning works great on the show on a character level; the ethics of the actual practice mean less than nothing here.\n\nDouble Yous:\n\n\u2022 Despite this supersize episode \u2014 36 minutes! \u2014 it\u2019s still possible to get through this entire first season of Living With Yourself in four hours. Very binge-able. (Though binging may be coming to an end.)\n\n\u2022 It really looks like the show used the set from the original Saw for its lactation room. How is this FDA-approved?\n\n\u2022 Maybe something\u2019s coming next season, but after using the pig carcass as the framing device for an entire episode, it seems like Miles 2.0 running it over with his car isn\u2019t enough of a payoff.\n\n\u2022 That final look from Kate as all three are locked into a hug is something much worse than the famously ambiguous final shot in The Graduate.", "description": "The season ends by fulfilling the promise of sustained Miles-on-Miles action, and a promise of complications to come.
