In total, 76 nominees have been shortlisted this year.\n\nAn innovative hands-free breast pump that can be worn inside a nursing bra, a flushable and biodegradable pregnancy test made without plastic, and a low-cost, pocket-size HIV test that can be self-administered at home have also received a nod.\n\nThe award is tied to an exhibition at London's Design Museum, showcasing the nominees, and although the selections are not based on any single underlying concept, there are themes emerging across the various disciplines.\n\nTommy Hilfiger's Adaptive line of clothing.

So we commissioned a film (about the nominees) to show sounds and textures and how these buildings are being used, and how these spaces are being occupied.\"\n\nThe Miami College Garage, a multi-story car park in Miami's design district, is among the Architecture nominees.
