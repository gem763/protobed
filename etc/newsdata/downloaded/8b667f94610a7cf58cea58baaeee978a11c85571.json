I know everyone was very grateful for the whole experience of a lifetime.\"\n\nIn May 2018, Washington Capitals owner Ted Leonsis made a similar gesture, surprising 200 full-time employees with a trip to Las Vegas for Game 1 or Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nRed rally towels draped the seats of Tuesday morning\u2019s charter flight, which included a specially prepared meal. Employees bused to the stadium together before Game 1 and didn\u2019t stop cheering until the Nationals closed out a 5-4 win.\n\n\u201cEvery single employee that I saw was on their feet,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cWe had the rally towels. There were chants. We were getting texts from other people in the ballpark that they could hear us very clearly throughout the stadium, so we apparently made our presence felt.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDurbin, who has worked for the team for a little more than two years, said it was especially rewarding to see longtime employees, including some who have been with the Nationals since 2005, experience a World Series game from the stands.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us that are behind-the-scenes every day of the year,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many people that work home games don\u2019t get to really experience it from a fan\u2019s perspective. We all walked in together, we all walked out together. It was just this big stream of red and constant cheering. It\u2019s been very cool to see people that have been doing this much longer than me finally experience this. It\u2019s not the sole thing we work toward, but it\u2019s such a common goal for everyone.\u201d\n\nWhile the Nationals\u2019 executive staff remained in Houston for Wednesday\u2019s Game 2, Durbin and most of her colleagues returned to D.C. to prepare for Wednesday\u2019s watch party at Nationals Park and Games 3, 4 and 5, if necessary, at home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDurbin referenced the \u201cI blacked out and then we won\u201d quote Ryan Zimmerman gave MASN\u2019s Dan Kolko after the Nationals\u2019 seven-run, ninth-inning comeback against the Mets in September to describe what work has been like during Washington\u2019s postseason run. There have been long hours and sleepless nights.\n\n\u201cThat cannot better sum up how the whole month of October has felt,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did we even get here? How did this even happen?\u201d\n\nMany full-time fans are wondering the same thing.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "About 200 employees and their guests cheered Washington's Game 1 win from the Minute Maid Park stands.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
