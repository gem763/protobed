Susan Collins (R-ME) and her reelection effort.\n\nCollins\u2019s legacy in the age of President Donald Trump was cemented with her vote to put Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, after Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault by his high school classmate Christine Blasey Ford (an allegation Kavanaugh denied).\n\nKavanaugh was shaping up to be a big issue for Collins\u2019s reelection even before this weekend\u2019s New York Times report, which suggested the FBI investigation and report on the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh were incomplete when the Senate voted to confirm him. Collins and a number of other moderate senators said the FBI investigation gave them confidence in Kavanaugh before they voted him in.\n\nWith Collins up for reelection in 2020, the moderate Maine senator is already in the political fight of her life, and Brett Kavanaugh is a huge factor. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report recently moved its appraisal of Collins\u2019s race from \u201clean Republican\u201d to a toss-up, citing a number of polls showing Collins losing ground and the emergence of a strong Democratic challenger.\n\nTo be sure, what few polls there are show Collins leading her closest challenger \u2014 Democrat and Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon \u2014 by double digits. Collins has a huge advantage with her name recognition. But a number Republicans are worried about is Collins\u2019 approval rating, which Morning Consult shows is at 45 percent, compared to 48 percent unfavorable.\n\nCollins has been a political institution in Maine for the past 22 years, when she first was elected to the Senate. She\u2019s easily cruised to reelection in the past, but Democrats think moderate women angry about Collins votes could make this year different. Maine is one of Democrats\u2019 top targets in their bid to take back the US Senate, and the race against Collins is already shaping up to be very expensive and hard-fought.\n\nIt could down to Maine voters like Pam Cunningham, who believe Collins\u2019s image has become tarnished in the age of President Donald Trump. Cunningham, a co-director for progressive group Mainers for Accountable Leadership, told Vox she voted for Collins when she was last up for reelection in 2014, but planned to vote against the senator this year.\n\n\u201cThe big pivot points for me were first the Gorsuch vote and then the tax vote, and then Kavanaugh,\u201d she told Vox this summer, referring to Collins\u2019s votes for two Trump Supreme Court judges and a tax cut bill. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s anywhere near as moderate as she\u2019d like us to believe.\u201d\n\nCollins knows she\u2019s lost support because of Kavanaugh, but she\u2019s determined voters won\u2019t just be making their choices based on that.\n\n\u201cHave I lost some votes because of my decision to support Justice Kavanaugh? Yes, I have. And I\u2019m sad about that because I explained in great depth my decision-making,\u201d Collins recently told Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett. But she added, \u201cthere still is an appreciation in Maine for someone who looks at the facts of an issue, votes with integrity and independence.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are energized to unseat Collins\n\nOf the three states Democrats are eyeing to take back a Senate majority \u2014 Colorado, Arizona, and Maine \u2014 Collins will be a tough incumbent to beat. She has three Democratic challengers; Gideon, lobbyist and progressive Betsy Sweet, and attorney Bre Kidman.\n\nSo far, Gideon appears to be the strongest contender. She\u2019s received backing from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and is posting strong fundraising numbers. If there was any doubt whether Kavanaugh would be a campaign issue, Gideon promoted a fundraising drive on Twitter Monday with a photo of Collins and Kavanaugh.\n\nI\u2019m running against Susan Collins for Senate.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m tired of hoping that Susan Collins does the right thing when she has shown time and time again that she puts Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell ahead of Mainers.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re with me, please make a contribution to our campaign today. \u2014 Sara Gideon (@SaraGideon) September 15, 2019\n\nGideon\u2019s name recognition statewide pales in comparison to Collins, according to a July AARP poll conducted by pollster Fabrizio Ward. That poll showed Collins leading Gideon 52 percent to 35 percent, and just 28 percent had an opinion of Gideon \u2014 showing the majority of the 600 likely voters polled didn\u2019t know who she was.\n\nBut Collins had troubling numbers of her own. Among voters who heard of both Collins and Gideon, the race essentially turned into a toss-up, with Collins barely leading at 47 percent to 44 percent.\n\n\u201cIn Maine we don\u2019t generally defeat incumbent senators,\u201d Maine political science expert Ken Palmer told Vox this summer. Palmer who pointed out the last time an incumbent senator was defeated was in the late \u201970s. \u201cThey like to keep their senators in, they like the seniority.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats seem particularly energized to try to defeat her, if only to deal a blow to Senate Republicans\u2019 majority. Democrats have a lot of ambitious, big ticket bills they\u2019d like to see passed, but they have no hope of doing so if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is at the helm.\n\nThe DSCC considers Collins a top target, and local groups like Mainers for Accountable Leadership have been gearing up for the Senate cycle for months with an eye towards winning, the group\u2019s executive director Marie Follayttar told Vox this summer. Maine Democratic Party spokesperson Alex Stack estimated there were nearly 100 volunteer canvassers joining on a July weekend, and he attributes that energy to a desire among left-leaning Mainers to see Collins gone.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of grassroots energy that came out of [the Kavanaugh vote],\u201d Stack told Vox this summer. \u201cPeople keep wanting to step up for us. That energy has not dissipated, it\u2019s only grown.\u201d", "description": "Collins is in the political fight of her life, and Kavanaugh is a huge factor.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60AXKDGegbEJaIUqPZIFj2I-uO0=/0x0:5043x2640/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19205632/GettyImages_1144323091.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
