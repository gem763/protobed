Capitalising on the positive momentum, it would lower the acceptance threshold of its offer to 62.5% from the previous 70%.\n\nThe biggest Osram shareholders AMS aims to convince are Allianz Global Investors <ALVG.DE> with 9.4% of the stock, UBS <UBSG.S> with 6.2% and Barclays <BARC.L> with 5.5%, according to latest filings.\n\nOsram's supervisory board decision to recommend AMS's offer was not unanimous. Employee representatives fear that AMS could break up the company. Osram's management and supervisory board are worried about the long-term business prospects.\n\nAMS has to take on billions of debt to finance the takeover, and Osram said paying off the funds could become difficult. AMS depended largely on a group of key customers, and that entailed the risk \"that the financial situation of the combined group may become very strained\" if key customers switched to other technological solutions or place less orders.\n\nOsram also voiced doubts whether the Austrian sensor specialist, whose number of staff is about a third of that of the German group, will be able to stem such a complex takeover.\n\n\"There is a risk that AMS may not be able to successfully organise the integration and to realise at the same time the publicly announced synergies in the intended short period of time,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Louise Heavens)", "description": "German lighting group Osram  advised its shareholders on Monday to accept a 4.3 billion euro ($4.8 billion) takeover bid from AMS   and sell their shares to the Austrian sensor specialist, saying the offer was economically attractive.
