However, they are both examples of the blind circular logic used to justify an authoritarian destruction of our unalienable rights, and stand as further irrefutable evidence of the crucial importance of the Second Amendment.\n\nSpeaking with Ted Cruz earlier this week, Alyssa Milano was joined by Fred Guttenberg and Ben Jackson as she aimed to convince the Texas Senator to support the expansion of gun control policies. When Cruz articulated the fear felt by many Americans regarding the demonstrated threat of gun confiscation, Alyssa Milano attempted to allay these concerns by applying the classic Leftist combination of presumed moral superiority and vague subjectivity.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to take all guns away from all people. We want to take certain guns away from certain people.\u201d\n\nAlyssa Milano perfectly represents those whose blissful lack of self-awareness in the pursuit of idealistic solutions acts as the perfect vehicle for cynical politicians who seek authoritarian power. Every one of the Left\u2019s policy proposals is presented with the false assumption that it will be forever implemented in good faith. History has shown this to be foolishly naive.\n\nWhile Milano and her contemporaries strove to softly push back against the perceived attack on the Second Amendment by citing some form of baseless specificity, Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rhetoric during the latest Democratic debate should convince even the most agnostic of Second Amendment advocates that their rights are under threat. With the clear goal of improving his stagnant poll numbers, the former Congressman has been relying on increasingly radical language. During the debate, he openly admitted that his administration would actively confiscate weapons from law-abiding citizens, stating:\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nSet aside the complete lack of logic or evidence behind Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s shameless emotional appeal. Set aside the fact that so-called \u201cassault rifles\u201d constitute a tiny proportion of gun-related crimes. Instead, look at the cold, hard truth. Beto O\u2019Rourke is proposing that the federal government forcibly seize constitutionally-protected and legally-owned firearms from law-abiding citizens. Under O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d, the federal government would literally confiscate unalienable rights from the citizenry of the United States, with the use of deadly force if required.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke may seem like a greater threat than Alyssa Milano, but they are both cut from the same immoral cloth. They both share the same fundamentally flawed logic, and are both advocating for the spread of tyranny, assuming the same form of undeserved moral superiority in order to justify the confiscation of unalienable rights. Both O\u2019Rourke and Milano are claiming the same moral superiority which has fueled the bloodiest chapters of human history.\n\nThe Founders understood this history, and remained wary of the moral fallibility of humans, and their propensity for tyranny under the guise of pursuing moral ends. Whether it\u2019s delivered softly and compassionately, or screamed maniacally, we cannot allow any vehicle for tyranny to gain traction.\n\nAfter all, the operative clause of the Second Amendment reads \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed,\u201d not \u201cthe right of some people to keep and bear some Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d", "description": "Because of the emotionally-fueled efforts of cynical politicians such as .09/17/2019 4:24:54AM EST.", "authors": ["Ian Haworth", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/7ce64a24-268e-4aae-b1e6-70079a6b628f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
