(AP) - The public can drop off unused, expired or unwanted prescription drugs at more than 110 collection sites across West Virginia this weekend.\n\nLaw enforcement officials are participating in the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Take Back Day from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday. Dropoff locations can be found online . The collection sites include sheriff, community police and state police offices, fire departments, and pharmacies and grocery stores.\n\nIn addition, e-cigarette devices will be collected after the batteries are removed.
