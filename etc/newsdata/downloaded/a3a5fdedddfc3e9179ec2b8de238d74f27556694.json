They ended up being pretty accurate.\n\nDespite fiery words from U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, the pledges made in New York didn't amount to any kind of a climate revolution.\n\nMore than 60 countries did commit to the target of becoming climate neutral by 2050 \u2014 one of the goals set for the summit by Guterres, but the biggest polluters ended up with a case of stage fright. Guterres had hopes of getting countries to commit to phasing out new coal-fired power plant construction by 2020 and bolstering national plans to cut emissions.\n\nSmall steps\n\nThe European Union, which sees itself as a global climate leader, was unable to make the mid-century climate neutrality pledge \u2014 four of its 28 member countries blocked the target, fearful of the economic cost of a rapid cut in emissions.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop European Council President Donald Tusk from claiming that \u201cEurope will win the race to become the world's first climate-neutral continent.\u201d\n\nEven that promise was more than other significant emitters were prepared to make.\n\nMore than 60 countries did commit to the target of becoming climate neutral by 2050 \u2014 one of the goals set for the summit by Guterres, but the biggest polluters ended up with a case of stage fright.\n\nChina, the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, made no new promises in New York, but did take a jab at U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a \u201choax,\u201d dismissed his own federal scientists\u2019 findings that fossil fuels effects on the planet are hitting every corner of the U.S. and signaled he would exit the Paris climate accord.\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal of certain parties will not shake the international community,\u201d said Wang Yi, a special representative of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also touched on U.S. climate policy, warning: \u201cI don\u2019t want to see new trade negotiations with countries who are running counter to the Paris Agreement.\u201d\n\nThe United States didn\u2019t even address the summit. However, Trump did surprise those at the conference by showing up for 14 minutes and listening to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, before leaving.\n\n\u201cHopefully our discussions today will be useful to you when you formulate climate policy,\u201d former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg joked from the stage after thanking Trump for attending.\n\nModi doubled down on India\u2019s plans to expand renewable power, but made no promises on curtailing coal consumption.\n\nJapan\u2019s environment minister, speaking at a side event, said he would reduce his nation\u2019s coal combustion, which has risen steadily after a turn away from nuclear power following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, but didn\u2019t offer how. \u201cI just became the environment minister last week,\u201d Shinjir\u014d Koizumi said.\n\nRussia said it would ratify the Paris Agreement, but didn't spell out any emissions cuts.\n\nInstead, the international community will likely have to wait, possibly until next year, for countries to punch up their climate pledges. By then, the U.S. will either have a new Democratic president-elect, sending a signal about enhanced involvement from the world\u2019s top historical emitter. Or it will have another four years of Trump, extending the vacuum created by the absence of the U.S. from climate diplomacy.\n\nIf looks could kill\n\nWhile at the summit, Trump strolled past Thunberg, who stared daggers at the climate-skeptic U.S. leader.\n\nCaptured by @Reuters Andrew Hofstetter: @GretaThunberg watches Trump arrive at the #UNGA. Thunberg condemned world leaders for failing to take strong measures to combat climate change: \u2018You have stolen my dreams\u2019 https://t.co/e9VfOa2kwW pic.twitter.com/kbJqF4rvxc \u2014 Reuters Top News (@Reuters) September 23, 2019\n\nThunberg\u2019s palpable anger at seeing Trump was also on full display when she lambasted world leaders. \"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth,\" she told them, adding: \u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\nGuterres was also unsparing in his criticism. \u201cNature is angry and we fool ourselves if we think we can fool nature because nature always strikes back and around the world nature is striking back with fury.\u201d\n\nHe chastised governments for giving \u201ctrillions in hard-earned taxpayers\u2019 money to the fossil fuel industry to boost hurricanes, spread tropical diseases, and heighten conflict,\u201d as well as plans for building \u201cever more coal plants that are choking our future.\u201d\n\nThe sense of urgency from Guterres is shared by many scientists. Another alarming report came out last week from the World Meteorological Organization, which found that the previous five years were the hottest period on record, and that global temperatures have risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. That leaves just 0.4 degrees before hitting the lower limit of the targets agreed in 2015 in Paris.\n\nAnother report on the state of the oceans is due to be delivered later this week.\n\n\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words\" \u2014 Greta Thunberg to U.N. leaders\n\nThat drumbeat of grim science is sparking a global protest movement. Millions of people took to the streets on Friday calling for more urgent climate action.\n\nIt\u2019s also become a political priority, as voters shift to parties with stronger climate policies.\n\nEuropean Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has made her so-called European Green Deal her No. 1 priority, including becoming climate neutral by 2050.\n\nThat's leading to growing pressure on EU countries to ditch their attachment to fossil fuels. On Friday, Germany promised a \u20ac54-billion program to go green.\n\nIn New York, Macron criticized Poland for leading the resistance to the 2050 net-zero goal.\n\n\"We had the carbon neutrality agenda of 2050, we have four countries that blocked, the reality is there is one country that blocked everything, it\u2019s Poland. My objective over the next few months is to convince the Polish to move,\" he said.\n\nWhat's next\n\nNGOs expressed disappointment at the lackluster results from New York.\n\n\"Most of the major economies fell woefully short. Their lack of ambition stands in sharp contrast with the growing demand for action around the world,\u201d said Andrew Steer, head of the World Resources Institute.\n\nVon der Leyen's European Green Deal is leading to growing pressure on EU countries to ditch their attachment to fossil fuels.\n\nThe action now shifts to Santiago, which hosts the COP25 climate talks this December. But the same cautious dynamic that played out in New York is likely to be repeated in Chile.\n\n\u201cWe need our young people in our countries to tell us to work faster,\" Macron said. \"We need the young people to help us to change things.\"\n\nBen Lefebvre and Rym Momtaz contributed reporting.\n\nCORRECTION: This article was updated to correct the misattribution of a quote.
