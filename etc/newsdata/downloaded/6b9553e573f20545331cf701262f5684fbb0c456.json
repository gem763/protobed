If you believe, sensibly, that removing the 45th is a precondition for all improvements, you should want Sanders\u2019s coming defeat in the Democratic nomination scramble to be postponed for a while.\n\nSaturday\u2019s rally was Sanders\u2019s announcement that he, like the Young Man in Longfellow\u2019s poem, is \u201cup and doing, with a heart for any fate.\u201d His message was: Never mind my heart attack. He is 78 and in his second run for the nomination is no longer a novelty, which Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a sprightly 70, is. Her persona, that of a hectoring schoolmarm, can be grating, but is less so than his, which recalls Dorothy Parker\u2019s description of Katharine Hepburn: \u201cShe runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.\u201d Sanders fluctuates between anger and indignation. Besides, it is entertaining to count how many times Warren plans to spend the same revenue from her wealth tax before it is declared unconstitutional (see Article I, Section 9).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe longer Sanders lasts before Warren cannibalizes his support, the better it will be for Joe Biden. And the longer Biden lasts as the broccoli candidate \u2014 not fun but good for you \u2014 the more time there will be for two grown-ups, Minnesota\u2019s Amy Klobuchar and Colorado\u2019s Michael F. Bennet, both senators, to thrive as unrecycled moderates. Were Democrats to nominate either, Trump\u2019s removal, which Democrats insist is their sovereign objective, would be assured. Consider some electoral realities:\n\nCharlie Cook of the Cook Political Report, in collaboration with the Kaiser Family Foundation, has found: \u201cSwing voters tend to be younger, more moderate, and less engaged in politics\u201d than those who already firmly support or oppose Trump, or than the overall electorate. Warren is not suited to make them swing away from Trump.\n\nMatt Fuehrmeyer writes in the Hill that Democrats could win back Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and still lose if Trump wins Minnesota, where Republicans flipped two House seats in 2018. Clinton defeated Trump there by just 1.5 percentage points, the weakest Democratic showing since 1984. Klobuchar would probably put Minnesota beyond Trump\u2019s reach.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Michigan, the closest 2016 state, Trump\u2019s victory margin was just two-tenths of a point. In 2018, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, whose un-Warrenesque slogan was \u201cFix the damn roads,\u201d was elected governor as a moderate who had opposed the Medicare-for-all proposals of her Democratic primary opponents. Warren is not ideally suited to recapturing Michigan.\n\nIn purple Colorado, voters in 2016 resoundingly rejected, 79 percent to 21 percent , a ballot initiative to create a state-run universal health-care system that would have been offered as a replacement for private health insurance. Warren is not as suited to Colorado as is Bennet, who has twice won statewide there.\n\nIn New Hampshire, where Clinton won by just three-tenths of a point, a recent poll found that whereas 28 percent want \u201cradical change\u201d \u2014 Warren\u2019s promise \u2014 57 percent want the country to get \u201cback to normal.\u201d No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Texas since Jimmy Carter in 1976 (barely: with just 51 percent ), and Democrats have not won a statewide race in Texas for a quarter of a century, since 1994. But although the state is acquiring a purple tinge \u2014 whites are only about one-third of Texans under 30 \u2014 it is not apt to be smitten with Warren in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump won Florida by just 1.2 points. In 2018, Republicans won the governorship by just four-tenths of a point and a U.S. Senate seat by two-tenths. The state\u2019s 29 electoral votes are within reach, but Warren is not the Democrat most likely to capture them. The same is true of purple Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina. In 2017, in Virginia, Democratic primary voters rejected the most progressive candidates for governor, then Democrats won the governorship.\n\nFinally, the most charming, the most adult campaign promise this season has been: \u201cIf you elect me president, I promise you won\u2019t have to think about me for two weeks at a time.\u201d So says Bennet.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Democrats need to focus on the electorate in the closest states.", "authors": ["George F.
