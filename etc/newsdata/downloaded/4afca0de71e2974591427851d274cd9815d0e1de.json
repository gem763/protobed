Both will worsen the basic dynamic for Trump.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has now made his need for Republicans to defend him on substance explicit. He just tweeted that Republicans are \u201cvery unified and energized,\u201d and \u201cnow are starting to go after the Substance, even more than the very infair Process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump added that \u201cthe Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that the call with the Ukrainian President was a totally appropriate one.\u201d\n\nIn claiming Republicans are \u201cstarting\u201d to go after substance, Trump is giving voice to what he needs to see happen.\n\nThe crucial context here is that on repeated occasions, Republicans have opted for fig-leaf ways of signaling support for Trump \u2014 to keep the rage of Trump and his supporters at bay \u2014 that simultaneously avoid defending him on the substance.\n\nAD\n\nSenate Republicans recently put forth a resolution attacking the process of the House impeachment inquiry, which the New York Times described as a way to \u201callow Republicans\" to \u201cshow the party base that they were behind Mr. Trump even as they refrained from defending his actions.\u201d\n\nAnd when House Republicans stormed an impeachment hearing, that secured a lot of Fox News coverage showing the base they were going to war \u2014 but the stunt was mainly a protest (based on bad-faith nonsense) of the process, an effort at misdirection away from substance.\n\nAD\n\nDefending Trump on the substance will only get harder.\n\nMore revelations are coming\n\nOn Wednesday, Catherine Croft, who worked on Ukraine-related issues for the National Security Council, will testify in the House impeachment inquiry. Here is part of what she will say:\n\nAD\n\nOn July 18, I participated in a sub-Policy Coordination Committee video conference where an OMB representative reported that the White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, had placed an informal hold on security assistance to Ukraine. The only reason given was that the order came at the direction of the President.\n\nWe already knew Mulvaney had done this at Trump\u2019s direction, but this bolsters that key revelation. And anything that focuses attention on Trump\u2019s freezing of the aid makes this worse. Let\u2019s recap.\n\nFirst, Trump wanted the Ukrainian president to launch \u201cinvestigations\u201d to absolve Russia of its role in sabotaging our election in 2016, and help rig the 2020 election by smearing potential opponent Joe Biden. This was dramatically reinforced by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman\u2019s testimony this week.\n\nSecond, part of the quid pro quo has already been established: We know that Trump\u2019s ringleaders in this scheme, acting at Trump\u2019s direction, conditioned a White House meeting on getting those \u201cinvestigations.\" That was confirmed in those texts and also reinforced by Vindman.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll of which leads to an impossible-to-dodge question: Given that Trump fully intended the meeting to be used to leverage the investigations he was demanding, why would he suddenly not intend the frozen military aid to accomplish precisely the same thing, at exactly the moment he was maximizing his leverage over Zelensky?\n\nTrump froze the aid a week before the July 25 call. Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr. contemporaneously objected to precisely this quid pro quo in those texts, and testified to it himself.\n\nIt\u2019s likely only a matter of time until this is more firmly established. Tim Morrison, who testifies this week and contemporaneously discussed this matter with Taylor, is expected to confirm key aspects of Taylor\u2019s account.\n\nAD\n\nWhich brings us to this \u201ctranscript.\u201d\n\nAbout that \u2018transcript\u2019\n\nAs the New York Times reports, Vindman, who listened in on the call, testified that he had protested that the summary left out key elements of it. In some cases, his edits were incorporated. In others, they were not:\n\nAD\n\nThe omissions, Colonel Vindman said, included Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nThe recording of Biden is probably a reference to this video of Biden talking about working to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor (which doesn\u2019t remotely support the conspiracy theory Trumpworld is spinning). And this doesn\u2019t alter our understanding of this whole story, since Trump has repeatedly referenced this recording and his desire to see the Bidens investigated.\n\nBut it\u2019s still important. It shows that on this call, Trump was more focused on the Bidens \u2014 and Zelensky more focused on investigating Burisma \u2014 than the summary implied.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t change our understanding of the underlying betrayal,\u201d Ned Price, a former senior director at the National Security Council, told me. \u201cBut it makes it much harder for Trump to argue that this was about \u2018corruption.\u2019 The omitted edits underscore the fact that Trump was singularly focused on the Bidens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNote that Trump\u2019s claim that the \u201ctranscript\u201d totally exonerates him is central to his demand that Republicans defend him on the substance. Trump wants Republicans to forcefully argue that he did nothing wrong by pointing to that transcript, as he is doing.\n\nBut not only do they know that the conduct it revealed was indefensible; and not only is the quid pro quo for military aid closer to getting nailed down; it\u2019s now even harder to point to the \u201ctranscript,\u201d because it has been overshadowed by the omissions from it. What\u2019s more, these omissions will remind Republicans that they are flying blind about how bad this could get, making them still more skittish.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The transcript contained omissions.
