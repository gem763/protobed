China Wants More Talks Before Signing Trump\u2019s \u2018Phase One\u2019 Deal\n\n(Bloomberg) -- China wants further talks as soon as the end of October to hammer out the details of the \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal touted by Donald Trump before Xi Jinping agrees to sign it, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBeijing may send a delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He, China\u2019s top negotiator, to finalize a written deal that could be signed by the presidents at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit next month in Chile, one of the people said. Another person said China wants Trump to also scrap a planned tariff hike in December in addition to the hike scheduled for this week, something the administration hasn\u2019t yet endorsed. The people asked not to be named discussing the private negotiations.\n\nThe details of the verbal agreement reached in Washington last week between the two nations remain unclear. While Trump hailed an increase in agricultural purchases as \u201cthe greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,\u201d China\u2019s state-run media only said the two sides \u201cagreed to make joint efforts toward eventually reaching an agreement.\u201d\n\nS&P 500 futures extended losses, the fell and the yen rose as investor pessimism on the deal grew.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment on further talks. Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesman, reiterated on Monday that both sides had made progress and said he hoped \u201cthe U.S. will work with China and meet each other halfway.\u201d\n\nInvestors have struggled to determine whether the U.S. and China reached a breakthrough in an 18-month trade war, with global stocks mixed on Monday. Worse-than-expected September trade figures in China underscored the growing pressure on both Trump and Xi to reach a deal to avert a wider slowdown in the global economy.\n\nChina has become increasingly wary of any statements from Trump. Trust between the two sides suffered a big blow in May 2018, when Trump put a stop to a deal for China to buy more energy and agricultural goods to narrow the trade deficit. The U.S. president further sowed distrust in August when he claimed that Chinese officials had called and requested to restart trade talks.\n\nFor Xi, it\u2019s seen as politically unfeasible to accept a final deal that doesn\u2019t remove the punitive tariffs altogether. Nationalists in the Communist Party have pressured him to avoid signing an \u201cunequal treaty\u201d reminiscent of those China signed with colonial powers.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. must concede on its December tariff threat if they want sign a deal during APEC summit, otherwise it would be a humiliating treaty for China,\u201d said Huo Jianguo, a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now vice chairman of the China Society For World Trade Organization Studies. \u201cThe U.S. has definitely shown some good gestures but we shouldn\u2019t exclude the possibility of another flip-flop.\u201d", "description": "China Wants More Talks Before Signing Trump\u2019s \u2018Phase One\u2019 Deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEEAE0DC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
