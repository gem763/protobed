Julien Warnand/Pool via REUTERS\n\nInflation in the euro zone languishes at less than half the ECB\u2019s target, the economic outlook is darkening again and support for Draghi\u2019s brand of aggressive money printing has never been lower among rate-setters.\n\nAll that is taking the shine off an eight-year reign that had its climax when Draghi single-handedly averted a collapse of the euro in 2012 with a pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the currency - code for coming to the rescue of heavily indebted euro zone countries.\n\nHis later moves have been less well supported and Draghi is set to spend at least part of his last press conference defending a decision to restart the ECB\u2019s 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying programme despite opposition from a third of fellow rate setters in September.\n\n\u201cWe expect Draghi to come up with a strong - emotional - plea in support of the September package, probably combined with a broader attempt to safeguard the legacy of all measures taken under his leadership,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING.\n\nRecent data is on his side. Price growth in the euro zone was a paltry 0.8% last month, a global trade war is threatening to push the bloc\u2019s largest economy, Germany, into a recession and the risk of a hard Brexit continues to loom large.\n\nThe ECB is all but certain not to make any policy changes on Thursday, six weeks after unveiling a package including new asset purchases worth 20 billion euros a month, a rate cut and a pledge to open the money taps further if needed.\n\nBut investors will be trying to gauge sentiment on the Governing Council after the very public spat that followed the last meeting and culminated in Germany\u2019s appointee to the ECB\u2019s board, Sabine Lautenschlaeger, stepping down.\n\nThe turmoil is certain to extend into the mandate of Draghi\u2019s successor, Christine Lagarde, who will take over on Nov 1 promising a review of the bank\u2019s \u201cmonetary framework\u201d, likely meaning its goal and tools.\n\n\u201cDespite Draghi\u2019s reputation as saviour of the euro, controversy over his policies will linger, forcing incoming president Lagarde to deal with them in next year\u2019s strategy review,\u201d Anatoli Annenkov, an economist at Societe Generale, said.\n\nHAWKS CIRCLE\n\nLagarde will have to deal with objections that Draghi\u2019s policy of sub-zero deposit rates and massive bond purchases are hurting savers, squeezing banks and pension funds and inflating financial bubbles, while doing little for inflation.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a minority of prominent hawks - including the central bank governors of France, Germany and the Netherlands - who question the wisdom of resuming the bond buying programme.\n\nFrance\u2019s representatives on the Governing Council have joined the chorus and 95% of respondents in a Reuters poll said the ECB\u2019s stimulus package would not significantly help in bringing inflation back to the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2%. [ECILT/EU]\n\n\u201cDissent within the Governing Council against the latest package cannot be ignored, especially since it is no longer coming exclusively from the same core countries,\u201d Gilles Moec, chief economist of French insurer Axa Group, said.\n\nThe problem for the ECB is that some of the major factors depressing prices are outside of its control.\n\nThese range from demographic and technological changes to the euro zone\u2019s reliance on exports, in particular German manufacturing, which leaves it to bear the brunt of the trade war.\n\nWith the ECB\u2019s firepower now largely spent, Draghi and his successor are likely to continue urging governments that are running a surplus, such as Germany and the Netherlands, to invest more to generate economic growth at home.\n\nBut latest budget figures, showing only a modest expansion, suggest their calls are likely to be frustrated for now.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expect sizeable stimulus only in case of a deeper downturn,\u201d Oliver Rakau, an economist at Oxford Economics, said.", "description": "Mario Draghi may be the man who saved the euro but his last press conference as President of the European Central Bank on Thursday is unlikely to be the grand finale he was hoping for.", "authors": ["Francesco Canepa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444275083&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M23V", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
