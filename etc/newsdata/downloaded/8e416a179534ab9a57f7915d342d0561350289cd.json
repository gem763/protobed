They will also need to pay for an up-to-date valuation on the property.\n\nIf a borrower wants to pay off more than 10 per cent, they must do so in 10 per cent increments.\n\nHomeowners who are looking to pay off their loan entirely may find themselves in a better position, according to Morrey.\n\nWHICH LENDERS OFFER HELP TO BUY REMORTGAGES?

This means the loan grows as your property grows in value.\n\nIf the property value drops however, the size of the loan will drop with it.\n\nAs of April this year, early adopters of Help to Buy have started making their monthly payments.\n\nThese payments are made up of 1.75 per cent interest on the loan, which rises each year by the Retail Price Index plus another 1 per cent.\n\nBorrowers looking to pay back some of the HTB loan, or staircase, will have more options open\n\nIs a 95 per cent mortgage a better option?\n\nIt is possible to buy a home without raising a big deposit, if you take a 95 per cent mortgage.\n\nWith one of these deals, first-time buyers able to pass mortgage affordability tests could put down a 5 per cent deposit of \u00a310,000 and buy a \u00a3200,000 home - and with more lenders offering these products, rates are becoming more competitive.\n\nYou're also not restricted to buying expensive new-builds with this type of product.\n\nBut is it cheaper in the long run to simply put down a 5 per cent deposit rather than take out a Help to Buy equity loan?\n\nMorrey said: 'If you bought at 95 per cent, owning the whole property, then usually after a few years the loan-to-value would drop to 90 per cent and below, at which point the products start to get cheaper and that would save you money, assuming rates don\u2019t change.\n\n'Because there is no Help to Buy element at all, then your choice of product is from all lenders that offer products appropriate to your situation.'\n\nBy not taking out a Help to Buy loan you would have access to the whole market, so there is a chance that you could get a better deal down the road. In addition, while 95 per cent mortgages are more expensive, you will not be left with an outstanding equity loan at the end of your term.\n\nHowever, a 95 per cent mortgage carries its own set of risks. A 5 per cent deposit is not much of a buffer against negative equity - and if house prices fall you may end up owing more to the lender than your house is worth.\n\nBigger deposits are always preferable as they usually secure lower rates for the homeowner. The lower the rate, the smaller the monthly repayment, meaning you can save yourself thousands of pounds in interest charges over the years.\n\n> Read our guide to 95% mortgages\n\n95 per cent mortgages will be more expensive but could afford you more choice down the road\n\nI'm looking to remortgage but I have a Help to Buy loan, what should I do?\n\nWhenever you come to remortgage it usually pays to have a look at a few different mortgage providers to ensure you're getting the best deal.\n\nYou can do this yourself either by going directly to each lender or you can use This is Money's mortgage finder tool which allows you to search for the lenders that offer Help to Buy remortgages.\n\nIt is always a good idea to seek independent financial advice while making this sort of decision.\n\nLastly, you can find This is Money's guide to remortgaging with a Help to Buy loan by clicking here.", "description": "Just 10 lenders accept  remortgages from Help to Buy borrowers looking to switch from another lender, meaning some may be better off jumping ship.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
