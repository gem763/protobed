Separately, AT&T said it would more than double its renewable energy purchases to more than 1.5 gigawatts of wind and solar.\n\nCompanies such as Genentech also said they will be electrifying their vehicle fleets. Last week, Amazon said it would buy 100,000 electric vehicles for its fleet. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nPharmaceutical maker Novo Nordisk, whose emissions from company cars and business flights exceeded total emissions from global production, said that it will seek zero emissions from its operations and transportation by 2030.\n\nTen companies committed to accelerate energy efficiency by 3 percent a year, said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, the private sector and subnational actors are moving faster than national governments. For example, 87 businesses have signed on to ambitious 1.5 degree C targets across their operations and value chains,\u201d Steer said in a statement.\n\nYet many companies have still not made such commitments, and those that have must be even more ambitious, climate experts say.\n\nDurwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said that corporate efforts \u201cif doubled, would be closer. They are not in the range of serious.\u201d He said a faster trajectory is needed. \u201cWinning slowly is the same as losing,\u201d he added, saying that the private sector needs to move \u201cat a speed that\u2019s similar to war footing.\u201d\n\nA Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll this summer found that 72 percent of respondents believe that businesses and corporations are doing too little to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cYou say, \u2018Oh there\u2019s enough money out there. So it\u2019s not a problem of money,\u2019 \u201d Angel Gurr\u00eda, secretary general of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, said on a panel discussion on Monday. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a matter of money. The money is over there and we need it over here.\u201d\n\nHe said that as a result, \u201cthe millions and trillions in the pension funds are not getting to the question of financing infrastructure, and financing infrastructure for climate change in particular.\u201d Gurr\u00eda said that \u201cwe\u2019re basically needing a better way of channeling those resources.\u201d\n\nGurr\u00eda said that while big companies fear for their reputation and worry about consumer backlash, small and medium-size companies don\u2019t feel such pressures unless brought by big ones in their supply chains.\n\nYet a broad array of companies are moving forward.\n\nIngersoll Rand promised to save one gigaton of CO2 emissions from its customers\u2019 footprint by 2030. The diversified manufacturing company said it will transform heating and cooling systems for buildings and for refrigerating cargo in transportation. One gigaton is the equivalent of the annual emissions of Italy, France and Britain combined.\n\nChocolate company Barry Callebaut said it would lift half a million West African cocoa farmers out of poverty and use new information sources to reduce deforestation, which accelerates climate change.\n\nAway from most of the U.N. events, a group called the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative gathered in the Madison Avenue home where financier J.P. Morgan once lived. It was here that Morgan let Thomas Edison hook the house up to electricity and light 400 bulbs, ushering in a new age of energy growth.\n\nBut on Monday, the group, whose 13 members had each pitched in $100 million and endorsed the 2015 Paris climate agreement, was showing off companies it has supported in their quest to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One firm would change the way cement is made. One is using satellites to pinpoint methane leaks from gas pipelines. One has an idea for a more efficient internal combustion engine. Another would bury carbon dioxide underground. And still another would attach \u201cmechanical sails\u201d to ships in order to harness the wind and improve fuel efficiency.\n\nSriram Madhusoodanan, climate campaign director at Corporate Accountability, took a dim view of the OGCI\u2019s event. \"The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative is yet another green-washing attempt by destructive and dangerous fossil fuel corporations that have knowingly fueled climate change,\u201d he said.\n\nBut OGCI chief executive Pratima Rangarajan said that \u201cwhat makes our fund so unique is that we have some of the world\u2019s largest companies behind us who can test and scale these technologies globally.\u201d\n\nShe said that \u201cin the climate game, we don\u2019t have decades, so this model is very powerful to shrink those timelines.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, more than 50 financial institutions with $2.9 trillion in assets said they will measure and disclose carbon emissions of projects they lend to and invest in. And they said they will use standardized methods similar to those developed by two large Dutch banks for those measurements.\n\n\u201cBy standardizing the way we measure emissions, it becomes possible to act to reduce it,\u201d said Keith R. Mestrich, president and chief executive of Amalgamated Bank. He said financial loans are \u201cpowerful tools\u201d that could be used.\n\nBut the banks stopped short of saying they were adopting policies to make their portfolios fossil-fuel-free.\n\nGurr\u00eda said that the private sector needs to move more quickly, adding that \u201cit\u2019s a battle against time.\u201d", "description": "As world governments' efforts to intensify efforts to curb climate change stall, some companies are setting their own targets", "authors": ["Steven Mufson", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Climate Change"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kAulm12l9O0jDM91mDm2eyhlNOs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZCHSPUCZ2YI6PG35CRLW3QHTTU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
