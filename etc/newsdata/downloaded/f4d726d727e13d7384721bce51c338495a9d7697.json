And while millennials are sometimes stereotyped as a generation with certain shared values when it comes to issues like the environment, culture and political leanings, what they want from the Liberal minority government is diverse.\n\nWe followed a group of undecided millennial voters throughout the election and tonight we check in with them about the final decisions they came to at the ballot box. 3:08\n\nClimate change\n\nDuring the election, the Liberals campaigned on a climate action plan that would see coal power phased out by 2030, in order to exceed the Paris agreement's carbon emission reduction targets.\n\nThe Liberals also pledged net-zero emissions by 2050, but fell short of explaining how their platform would achieve that.\n\nLiving in Ontario's Spadina-Fort York riding, Sabaah Choudhary wants the Liberals to set clear goals on how they will meet net-zero emissions by 2050. (Sabaah Choudhary)\n\n\"I want to see what the measurable actions will be for [net-zero emissions],\" said Choudhary, who voted for the Liberals and now wants the specifics of how they'll deliver on their promises. \"How will we reach those targets?\"\n\nIn addition, the carbon tax is expected to increase to $50 per tonne by 2022 under a Liberal government.\n\nDespite the hike from the current $20 per tonne, Emily Zhu said she doesn't have an issue with paying more to reduce emissions.\n\n\"I'm willing to sacrifice other parts of my budget for the carbon tax,\" said the 21-year-old from Montreal, who voted for the NDP but now expects the Liberals to step up on the environment.\n\n\"However, I just don't know how that is going to affect more marginalized, more vulnerable communities. For me, it would make more sense to have a proportional tax based on a person's income.\"\n\nPipelines and Western Canada\n\nMeanwhile, the Liberals are also going to have to deal with pipelines, an issue that has been dividing the country along geographic, economic, environmental and political lines.\n\nWasting no time after the election win, on Wednesday Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to forge ahead with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion despite opposition from environmentalists.\n\nThat decision got Beaudoin's approval, and she thinks it is a more uniting than divisive move for Canada in the long run.\n\n\"I was really happy to hear him address that and reunite Canada after the election,\" said Beaudoin, who voted for the Conservatives.\n\n\"I think talking about that pipeline \u2026 was really confirming he did get that message when those two provinces went blue.\"\n\nKatie Beaudoin says she hopes Trudeau will work with the Conservatives to ensure the needs of Western Canada are heard. (Katie Beaudoin)\n\nAs someone who spent two years working as a paramedic in Alberta's energy sector, she understands the sentiments of Western alienation being expressed by Albertans.\n\nHowever, Beaudoin says she believes building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion isn't the only way to improve relations with Western Canada.\n\n\"I definitely think we need electoral reform if we're all going to get along better in the future, so that all Canadians can feel more heard,\" she said.\n\nTrudeau campaigned on electoral reform in the 2015 election, but walked away from the commitment two years later citing a lack of \"consensus\" on the issue. Beaudoin says this is a second chance for the Liberals to make good on that promise.\n\nYouth mental health\n\nEmily Zhu has one piece of advice for the government on youth mental health: 'Listen to us.' (Emily Zhu)\n\nAnother issue that was top of mind for some of the millennials CBC News spoke to during the campaign, and which remains so in the wake of the election, is health care \u2014 particularly mental health.\n\n\"They're not taking this as seriously as it should be taken,\" said Zhu, referring to the Liberal government's approach on youth mental health.\n\nThe Liberals have promised to boost health care funding by $6 billion over the next four years, which includes improving access to mental health services so that, \"Canadians can get the support they need quickly, when they need it most.\"\n\nBut Zhu, a mental health advocate, wants the government to do more surrounding youth mental health in the wake of several campus suicides at the University of Toronto since 2018.\n\n\"It's not just about resources,\" she said. \"What are the issues that are causing mental health challenges among Canadian youth?\n\n\"Investing in youth mental health is investing in the future.\"", "description": "CBC News spoke to these millennials at the beginning of the federal election to find out what they thought about the party election campaigns.
