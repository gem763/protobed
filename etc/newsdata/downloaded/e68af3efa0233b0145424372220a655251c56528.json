This is currently under investigation; however, we would advise that you try reconnecting at regular intervals. Apologies for any inconvenience,\" NatWest said on Twitter in response to complaints.\n\nA spokesperson for the bank said the mobile Bankline app is unaffected.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe outage follows another incident with the app on Thursday, which showed some customers other firms' accounts when they logged in with their own details. The problem has been resolved.\n\nThe issues are the latest in a string of IT problems for NatWest and its parent Royal Bank of Scotland. Last month, both bank's websites went down on the same day, leaving users unable to manage their accounts online, although the lenders said their mobile apps were still working.\n\nBut IT troubles are not confined to those two banks.\n\nFigures from the Financial Conduct Authority show UK banks suffered more than one IT shutdown each and every month in 2018, including a nine-month period when Barclays had 41 blackouts and Lloyds 37.\n\nThese outages can have a long-term impact on customers. For example, scheduled payments may not go through or, if consumers can\u2019t access their accounts to make payments, that can have a negative impact on their credit report. This can damage their ability to be accepted for financial products in future, like a mobile phone contract or even a mortgage. It could mean they only have access to higher interest rates, which increases the cost of credit.", "description": "Some NatWest customers are unable to log into the desktop version of the lender's Bankline app for businesses, the bank has said. \"We\u2019re aware that some customers may be experiencing issues logging in to Bankline.
