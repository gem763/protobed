He\u2019s also itching to ruin the life of Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who has led the investigation into the complaint and who finds himself, once more, as the b\u00eate noire of the Trump presidency.\n\nDuring a press conference that was notable, even by Trump standards, for the pique in the president\u2019s tone, Trump claimed\u2014without any evidence\u2014that Schiff had helped write the whistleblower\u2019s complaint that included details about Trump\u2019s now infamous July 25 phone conversation with the Ukrainian leader. He called the congressman a \u201cfraud\u201d after previously accusing him of treason and demanding that he resign.\n\nElsewhere, Rudy Giuliani\u2014Trump\u2019s personal attorney who is at the center of the president\u2019s scandalous quest to enlist the Ukrainian government into investigating the Biden family\u2014teased the scenario of the president suing the Democratic lawmaker. Giuliani later told The Daily Beast that he and Trump have privately discussed and are \u201cconsidering a lawsuit against a number of people but [Schiff is] one of the worst in terms of provable false statements\u201d\u2014a threat that seems, at least for now, unlikely to go far.\n\nThe decision to focus so heavily on Schiff marked a classic roll of the dice for the president and his team. Faced with an investigation into the unseemly inner workings of his administration, Trump has chosen to villainize his investigator. It was a tactic he applied with some success to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose probe revealed a sustained attempt to obstruct Mueller\u2019s own investigation. But unlike Mueller\u2013who operated in almost complete silence for two years\u2014Schiff has chosen to engage the vitriol directly.\n\n\u201cI think Americans have to be worried about the stability of our president given the enormously erratic and dangerous swings we have seen him take in the last few days,\u201d the congressman told The Daily Beast during a brief interview on Wednesday. \u201cIt is alarming.\u201d\n\nWhether Trump can turn questions about the propriety of his attempts to dig up dirt on Biden into a discussion about the merits of the investigation into those attempts could very well determine the future of his presidency. He certainly seems keen on trying to make it work. On Wednesday, he swiftly decried reports that an emissary of the whistleblower had reached out to Schiff\u2019s Intelligence Committee staff, who then advised him to go through the formal channels of filing a complaint.\n\nSchiff had previously denied that his staff had contact with the whistleblower before the complaint was flagged for them by the Intelligence Community\u2019s Inspector General. On Wednesday, he said that he did not know definitively at the time if the complaint had been authored by the same whistleblower who had approached his staff. But he acknowledged that he \u201cshould have been much more clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe try not to confirm when people have come in. I was really thinking along the lines of wanting to get him to come in to testify,\u201d Schiff told The Daily Beast. \u201cI regret that I wasn't much more clear.\u201d\n\nSuch nuance is unlikely to win converts inside the White House where anger among senior staff seems to be firmly directed at the congressman and driven by a belief that his inaccuracies are covered more sympathetically than the president\u2019s. One senior aide even proclaimed that Trump was \u201cfar more focused\u201d on Schiff than he was on the identity of the whistleblower himself.\n\nBut others in the administration say that the president remains consumed by the source of the written complaint now threatening to derail his presidency.\n\nSince late last week, Trump has asked officials and advisers what the legal options are if the currently anonymous whistleblower is ever unmasked or named in news reports, according to two people who\u2019ve heard the president discuss this. Trump, one of these sources said, has also privately voiced his belief that it is only a matter of time until the whistleblower goes on the record, or the identity becomes public or gets printed.\n\nThe president\u2019s fascination with this person\u2019s name has not gone unnoticed by the whistleblower\u2019s legal team. Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower\u2019s lead attorney, has said that Trump\u2019s public comments have \u201cheightened our concerns that our client\u2019s identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d (The whistleblower currently enjoys anonymity under long-established federal legal protections in such cases.)\n\nStill, there is a rapidly growing appetite in Trumpworld for this whistleblower to show himself, and take all the abuse and consequence that would invariably come with it.\n\n\u201cIf the president wants to\u2026 talk to foreign official, and it's sensitive and it doesn't meet the approval of some anonymous deep-stater, then tough bananas,\u201d said former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA), now a Trump surrogate. \u201cIf this guy is so self-righteous, why doesn't he come out like a man and... go on the record, and charge up the hill and sound the alarm?\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s news conference on Wednesday was overflowing with venom and animus, much directed at the California Democrat.", "authors": ["Sam Stein", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Politics Editor", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570070735/191002-Swin-Trump-tease_h7blap"}
