His lawyers say no other appeals, including to the U.S. Supreme Court, are planned.\n\nSoliz\u2019s lawyers had argued he suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which left him with brain damage. His attorneys said the disorder is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of conditions already recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court as disqualifying exemptions to the death penalty, such as intellectual disability.\n\n\u201cOur argument (was) the Supreme Court is extending that doctrine to fetal alcohol syndrome,\u201d said Seth Kretzer, one of Soliz\u2019s appellate attorneys.\n\nProsecutors portrayed Soliz as a dangerous individual who killed Weatherly for a \u201cpittance of property.\u201d\n\nIf the execution happens, Soliz would be the 15th inmate put to death this year in the U.S. It would be the sixth execution in Texas and the second in as many weeks in the state. Nine more executions are scheduled in Texas this year.\n\nKretzer had argued in court documents that heavy drinking by Soliz\u2019s mother during her pregnancy resulted in numerous problems for the inmate, including impulsivity, learning difficulties, and an IQ of 75 that is \u201cconsidered borderline impaired.\u201d An IQ of 70 or below is generally considered to be intellectually disabled.\n\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorder, combined with a chaotic and troubled childhood that included living with drugs and prostitution, left Soliz entering \u201cadult life ill-prepared,\u201d Kretzer wrote.\n\nJurors at his 2012 trial as well as previous appeals court rulings have rejected Soliz\u2019s claims that his actions were due to the impacts of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.\n\nAt his trial, prosecutors said Soliz and another man, Jose Ramos, committed at least 13 crimes in the Fort Worth area over eight days in June 2010.\n\nAfter fatally shooting a deliveryman around 6 a.m. on June 29, 2010, the duo later that morning drove in a stolen car to Weatherly\u2019s home. Prosecutors say Soliz and Ramos forced their way into the home at gunpoint and ransacked the place, taking a television, cellphones and credit cards.\n\nProsecutors say Weatherly begged for her life and pleaded that Soliz not take her deceased mother\u2019s jewelry box before she was shot in the back of the head.\n\nA friend of Soliz\u2019s told jurors Soliz had bragged to her about killing an \u201cold lady\u201d in a house in Godley, had laughed about the incident and ridiculed the lady\u2019s \u201ccountry\u201d accent.\n\nPolice say Soliz confessed to killing Weatherly and ballistics and fingerprint evidence also tied him to the slaying.\n\nRamos was sentenced to life in prison for the deaths of Weatherly and the deliveryman, Ruben Martinez.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2002 barred the execution of mentally disabled people but has given states some discretion to decide how to determine intellectual disability. However, justices have wrestled with how much discretion to allow.\n\nThe Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office said in court documents filed earlier this month that the Supreme Court has not held that individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are exempt from capital punishment and that Soliz has not presented an expert opinion stating he is intellectually disabled.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office said in its motion with the 5th U.S. Circuit of Appeals that a Fort Worth police detective testified Soliz was \u201cmore sophisticated, calculated, and dangerous\u201d than his partner Ramos and that \u201cSoliz was the most dangerous person with whom he had come into contact\u201d in his 16 years as a police officer.\n\n___\n\nLozano reported from Houston.\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.
