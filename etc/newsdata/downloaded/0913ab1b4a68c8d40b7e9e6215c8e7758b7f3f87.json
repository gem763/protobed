The obesity figure has steadily risen each of the past five years, the study shows, and the rate remains significantly higher for men than women.\n\nThe troubling figures carry real-world consequences, the report\u2019s authors argue, including higher medical costs for overweight personnel.\n\n\u201cObesity negatively impacts physical performance and military readiness and is associated with long-term health problems such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and risk for all-cause mortality,\u201d the study says. \u201cStudies also suggest that healthcare utilization is higher among obese service members than their normal-weight counterparts.\u201d\n\nThe survey followed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines in defining obese service members as those with a body mass index above 30.\n\nThe Navy is by far the most overweight branch of the military, according to the study. Data show that 22% of Navy personnel were classified as obese, compared to 18.1% for the Air Force and 17.4% for the Army.\n\nThe Marine Corps had by far the lowest number at 8.3%.\n\nOlder males are the most obese demographic. Men ages 35 to 44 had an obesity rate of 29.4%, the report found, while those over the age of 45 were close behind at a rate of 28.4%.\n\nTheir female counterparts had obesity rates of 21.3% and 18.5%, respectively.\n\nThe full study can be found here: https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Combat-Support/Armed-Forces-Health-Surveillance-Branch/Reports-and-Publications/Medical-Surveillance-Monthly-Report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
