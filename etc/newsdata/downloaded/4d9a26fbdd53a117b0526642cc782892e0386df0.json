Here\u2019s what we know so far.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE \u2018BMF\u2019 TITLE?\n\nBMF stands for \u201cBaddest Mother F****r\u201d and was a phrase coined by Nate Diaz during his post-fight press conference after his win over Anthony Pettis at UFC 241. He said he was fighting for \u201cThe Baddest Mother F****r In The Game\u201d belt.\n\nIt was a figure of speech at the time \u2013 no such belt existed \u2013 but when the UFC booked his upcoming bout with fellow UFC star Jorge Masvidal, UFC president Dana White decided, just for kicks, that he\u2019d actually commission a \u201cBMF\u201d belt to be made. It has reportedly cost the UFC $50,000 to make and was set to be presented to the winner of the UFC 244 main event by former WWE superstar and movie megastar Dwayne Johnson, AKA \u201cThe Rock\u201d.\n\nAlso on rt.com The Rock to present Masvidal-Diaz winner with $50,000 'BMF' belt at UFC 244\n\nWHAT\u2019S GONE WRONG?\n\nOn Thursday night, a clearly livid Diaz posted a tweet that featured the following message:\n\nI\u2019m not gonna make it out to NYC for fight week next week because they say I tested with elevated levels that they say might be from some tainted supplements. I call false on that cause I only take Whole Foods or natural food supplements. I don\u2019t even eat meat. So until UFC, USADA or whoever is F*****G with me fixed it, I won\u2019t be competing. I\u2019m not gonna play their game and try to hide it or keep quiet, as they suggested. I\u2019m not gonna have my name tainted as a cheater like these other motherf*****s who keep quiet until after the fight just so they can get paid. F****n\u2019 cheaters. I don\u2019t give a f**k about some money over my dignity and my legacy. I\u2019m not playing along with this bulls**t. I\u2019m not staying quiet and figuring it out after the fight. That\u2019s cheating. So fight game I\u2019ll see you when I see you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe real baddest mother f****r in the game.\n\nYour all on steroids not me pic.twitter.com/ykrZmRIoPS \u2014 Nathan Diaz (@NateDiaz209) October 24, 2019\n\nIt means Diaz is saying he won\u2019t fight at UFC 244 unless the authorities move quickly to clear up whatever anomaly has shown up in his test.\n\nIS DIAZ A CLEAN ATHLETE?\n\nWhile Diaz has a reputation as something of a maverick and a man who enjoys smoking marijuana between fights, his reputation as a clean athlete is a strong one. He and his brother Nick are vegans and are famously careful with what they eat, so the suggestion of even a tainted supplement is one that would upset Diaz, as we\u2019ve seen in his statement above.\n\nHe received a message of support from UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones, who said Diaz owed it to his fans to fight the anti-doping establishment, and that he was familiar with the feeling of being \"set up\".\n\nI know you feel like someone is setting you up, that\u2019s exactly how I felt. At times its going to feel like a pretty hopeless situation but maybe it\u2019s not, you can\u2019t just give up and do nothing. This is a different type of fight man, you owe it to your fans to fight it. \u2014 Jon Bones Jones (@JonnyBones) October 24, 2019\n\nDiaz also received support from his opponent at UFC 244. As the news was breaking, Jorge Masvidal took to Twitter and posted a message to Diaz, saying: \u201cYou not the baddest mofo in the game (i am) but you are one of the cleanest mofo\u2019s @NateDiaz209 I\u2019ll see you nov 2. I know your name is clean. I don\u2019t need @usantidoping to tell me s**t!\u201d\n\nYou not the baddest mofo in the game (i am) but you are one of the cleanest mofo\u2019s @NateDiaz209 I\u2019ll see you nov 2. I know your name is clean. I don\u2019t need @usantidoping to tell me shit! \u2014 Jorge Masvidal UFC (@GamebredFighter) October 24, 2019\n\nWHY HAS DIAZ SPOKEN OUT?\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting question. As things stand, USADA hasn\u2019t issued a suspension, which means Diaz is technically still clear to fight. But they have flagged an issue with a recent test.\n\nUsually, this is initially communicated in private to the athlete and the promoter but, rather than stay quiet on the matter and go through with the fight before dealing with any potential issues afterward, Diaz has opted to go public with the information. He knows his big-money fight is at risk but, more importantly to him, his reputation is at stake.\n\nDiaz has decided to put his reputation before a payday, and that, on the face of it, seems like the honorable and creditable thing to do.\n\nAs of right now, Diaz vs. Masvidal is still on, and Diaz hasn\u2019t been suspended. But it\u2019s more complex than that. More: pic.twitter.com/mqhgCc284n \u2014 Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) October 25, 2019\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest question of all. In theory, the fight could still go ahead, but it would need USADA to make a statement on Diaz\u2019s test \u2013 which they can now do, as Diaz has gone public about it \u2013 and clear up the situation.\n\nIn short, it all boils down to whether Nate Diaz failed the drug test, or whether USADA was merely informing him of the presence of an anomalous substance that wasn\u2019t present in large enough amounts to fail the test.\n\nIf the amounts discovered are trace amounts and not adjudged to be above set thresholds, then Diaz is free to fight. In that case, it\u2019ll be a job for the UFC and USADA to reassure Diaz that his reputation will be retained and to help isolate whatever may have caused the testing anomaly. If the Diaz\u2019s test isn\u2019t flagged above allowable limits and the UFC and USADA can get Diaz onside, the fight may still go ahead.\n\nHowever, if the amount discovered sits above the allowable limit, then that makes it very hard for USADA to treat Diaz any differently to any other athlete who has had a similarly flagged test. In that case, they would be duty-bound to issue a suspension in line with similar past cases. In that situation, it\u2019s highly likely that Diaz would walk away from the UFC, and possibly the sport.\n\nSo far, there has been very little word out of USADA who gave a one-line statement to ESPN, saying: \"UFC and USADA are gathering information and will issue a statement as soon as possible.\"\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF DIAZ IS OUT?\n\nThe show must go on, as they say, and UFC 244 will have to continue with a new main event. Masvidal will take on either a replacement opponent, or he\u2019ll be pulled from the card, with the co-main event bout between Kelvin Gastelum and Darren Till moving up to the main event slot.\n\nIf Masvidal remains on the card, there are a few possible options who could step in. Reigning UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman has offered to step in and fight Masvidal, even though he has a title defense scheduled against Colby Covington at UFC 245 the following month, while Donald \u201cCowboy\u201d Cerrone is never shy of an opportunity to step in and take up a fight.\n\nMasvidal and Cerrone faced off in a bout at UFC on FOX 23 in January 2017 in a fight that Masvidal won by second-round TKO. Cerrone just loves fighting, and would likely be more than happy to dance again with \u201cGamebred\u201d in a bid to save the show and avenge his defeat.\n\nAlso on rt.com Bad Motherf*ckers: Who are the next contenders for the UFC's 'BMF' title?\n\nWHAT ABOUT CONOR McGREGOR?\n\nThe thought of McGregor jetting in from Russia and taking on Masvidal on just over a week\u2019s notice would certainly appeal to the Irish maverick, but drafting McGregor in at such short notice may not make sense to the UFC as a promoter.\n\nThe Irishman\u2019s fights draw bigger pay-per-view audiences than any other fighter in the sport, and to maximize that box-office potential it makes more sense for McGregor\u2019s fights to get a longer run-up.\n\nStepping in at short notice would be an incredible story, and McGregor did tweet declaring himself to be the real \u201cBMF\u201d but he also stopped short of offering to step in. He then deleted the tweet.
