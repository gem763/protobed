I guess that is why they are doing it at night.\u201d\n\nAthletics officials have pledged additional medical and safety measures for marathon runners and race walkers.\n\nThe IAAF, the global governing body of athletics, said the women\u2019s marathon, scheduled to start at midnight on Friday, would go ahead as planned as temperatures would be at or below 30 degrees.\n\nIt said its medical delegate had assured athletes that weather conditions would be monitored all day and reported to the teams \u201cto ensure the event is run at an acceptable level of health risk.\u201d\n\nWET SHOTS, STICKY GRIPS\n\nTrack athletes competing inside the stadium said it was unlikely that the heat would significantly affect their performances, but conceded that practices have been especially draining.\n\n\u201cAt practice I\u2019m glowing because I\u2019m sweating because it\u2019s so humid,\u201d said Rai Benjamin, who competes in the 400m hurdles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I got out of the shower. But I don\u2019t think it will be that bad because of the cooling system.\u201d\n\nShot putter Ryan Crouser, the 2016 Olympic champion, said he has had to heat up his shots to around 38 degrees Celsius to prevent them from becoming wet during practices in the sizzling heat and high humidity.\n\n\u201cThe shot is far below the dew point, the instant you take it out, it\u2019s just soaking wet and it\u2019s dripping water,\u201d the American said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than if it was pouring down rain... We\u2019ve been fighting this a little bit.\u201d\n\nEuropean pole vault champion Armand Duplantis, who trains in the heat of the southern U.S. state of Louisiana, said the humidity can prove helpful in practice because the addition of moisture to the chalk on his hands \u201cmakes for a really nice grip.\u201d\n\nBut other pole vaulters who spray a sticky grip enhancer on their hands might have more difficulty holding onto their poles in the humidity, he said.\n\n\u201cFor people who use sticky spray, I can see it being a problem because it can get a little slimy and gooey,\u201d Duplantis said.", "description": "Some competitors at the world athletics championships that began on Friday have already encountered their most challenging opponent: the sweltering Qatari heat.", "authors": ["Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
