Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) appeared in a photo with Geert Wilders, a controversial Dutch parliamentary leader with anti-Islam and anti-immigrant views, while both attended a European security conference in Italy.\n\nGraham and Wilders, leader of the Party of Freedom in the Netherlands, were seen smiling together Saturday night at the Ambrosetti Forum on Italy\u2019s Lake Como.\n\nWilders posted the picture to his Twitter account, writing, \u201cGreat to meet with US Senator @LindseyGrahamSC.\u201d The post was deleted shortly after it was published.\n\nWilders has drawn criticism for his views toward Islam. He has advocated for a tax on women who wear a hijab, supported a ban on Muslims immigrating to the Netherlands and said he feared a future with \u201cmore mosques than churches\u201d in his country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate Muslims, I hate Islam,\u201d he once said.\n\nDuring his presentation Saturday, Wilders predicted that nationalist parties in Europe would make a strong comeback. \u201cI believe there is a lot of support among the people, especially on the issue of immigration,\u201d he said.\n\nGraham was traveling back to Washington on Sunday and could not be reached for comment to explain his exchange with the Dutch figure.\n\nKevin Bishop, a spokesman for Graham, said Sunday that the senator took pictures with many of the attendees at the forum and that Graham has no idea why Wilders deleted the tweet with the picture of them.\n\n\u201cMr. Wilder took a photo with Sen. Graham as did many others at the conference,\u201d Bishop said, adding that he has \u201cno idea why Mr. Wilder removed the photo from Twitter. You may want to ask him.\u201d\n\nThe Geert Wilders account has since deleted his photo with Lindsey Graham, but I had the tab still open on my browser so here it is: pic.twitter.com/WTQrTuHgZW \u2014 John Hudson (@John_Hudson) September 7, 2019\n\nGraham and Wilders were not expected to appear on any panels together at the forum, which the GOP senator has attended in the past. Two years ago, Graham flew to Italy for the forum with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), just weeks after his close friend had been diagnosed with brain cancer.\n\nMcCain, a fierce critic of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy, used that appearance at the Ambrosetti Forum to call for U.S. leaders to remain engaged in the world and praised American diversity. McCain criticized the white nationalists who had marched in Charlottesville just weeks before his address at the forum and praised citizens helping with hurricane relief along the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\u201cThis is America at its best \u2014 ordinary people, despite long odds, rising to master moments of extraordinary challenge, powered by their belief in that most simple and audacious of ideas \u2014 that all people are created equal,\u201d McCain said.\n\nGraham, who worked with McCain on immigration legislation in 2013 that would have created a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, has become one of Trump\u2019s most trusted allies in Congress, particularly since McCain died Aug. 25, 2018.", "description": "The picture was taken at a security forum in Italy.
