The government is also scheduled to detail a turnaround plan for loss-making state power utility Eskom by month-end.\n\nHigher export volumes, an improvement in new-vehicle sales and a stronger exchange rate relative to major trading and investment currencies contributed to the recovery.", "description": "Confidence increased from its lowest level in more than three decades in September.", "authors": ["- Prinesha Naidoo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8135/63d1ecebae544fee930b4e2703fd8ab7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
