William Taylor\u2019s damning deposition. House Democrats are now redoubling their efforts at pulling Pompeo deeper into an impeachment inquiry the secretary has met with defiance.\n\nTaylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, told legislators on Tuesday that Pompeo loomed large in what Taylor described as an \u201cirregular\u201d effort to make assistance to Ukraine contingent on the young Volodomyr Zelensky government\u2019s willingness to investigate Trump\u2019s domestic political rivals.\n\nIn a letter to Congress earlier this month, Pompeo said he would hold on to relevant communications and materials in order to protect career diplomats and officials in his department. Now, though, congressional staffers tell The Daily Beast they are again attempting to gain access to key evidence and say Pompeo\u2019s reasoning for withholding is shallow. Those staffers pointed to the State Department\u2019s history of mistreating officials for their perceived disloyalty to the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cPompeo is not just a yes man to the president, he is a hell-yes man,\u201d said Thomas Countryman, who retired from State in January 2017 after a three-decade diplomatic career. \u201cIt\u2019s been especially disappointing that as he is asked hard questions, he adopts the Trumpian style of refusing to engage in substance and going into ad hominem attacks. It reminds me of the old RCA ads: \u2018His Master\u2019s Voice.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c Pompeo is not just a yes man to the president, he is a hell-yes man. \u201d \u2014 Former State Department official Tom Countryman\n\nPressure is mounting against Pompeo following Taylor\u2019s testimony Tuesday and in anticipation of Saturday\u2019s appearance by the department\u2019s Acting Assistant Secretary at the Bureau for European and Eurasian Affairs Phil Reeker. Two sources close to the impeachment inquiry said they expect Reeker to supply additional information about Pompeo\u2019s role in the Giuliani shadow diplomatic effort to convince Ukraine to dig up dirt on 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\n\"Obviously, [Pompeo] is central to this series of events. I think it would be very useful to hear from him to establish all the necessary facts in the case,\u201d Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt's hard to imagine he would be completely candid, since he's smack in the middle of this in a very, very serious way.\u201d\n\nEven before Taylor\u2019s deposition, Pompeo\u2019s involvement in the scandal was known. Pompeo was on the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, the one where Trump asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2013 enabling investigations of his political rivals \u2013 after Zelensky mentioned his desire for more American anti-tank missiles for use against Russian-sponsored separatists. That call enabled an effort quarterbacked by Rudy Giuliani and aided by State appointees \u2014 something Pompeo suggested to ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz in September was unfamiliar to him.\n\nSoon afterward, Pompeo took an obstructionist position toward the inquiry. He refused to turn over documents or permit department officials to talk with House investigators, on grounds of protecting his employees from congressional \u201cbullying.\u201d It hasn\u2019t worked. Along with two key figures in the pressure campaign, special envoy Kurt Volker and ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and former Ukraine ambassador Maria Yovanovich, Taylor became the fourth State Department official to talk \u2014 and the first to make Pompeo a central figure.\n\nTaylor stated that he told Pompeo, who recruited him to helm the embassy in Kyiv, that he would only accept the ambassadorship if Pompeo supported him against what he called \u201ca web of political machinations in Kyiv and in Washington\u201d to undermine U.S. policy supporting Kiev against Moscow. Those machinations had detonated Yovanovich\u2019s like-minded ambassadorship. Pompeo, Taylor said, gave Taylor his desired assurances \u2013 meaning that Pompeo knew about the shadow effort as early as that May 28 conversation.\n\nWhen Taylor arrived in Ukraine in June, he said, he found little evidence of such support from the secretary. Giuliani, Volker, and Sondland seemed to be in charge of the policy, and they were pushing to get Zelensky to publicly commit to investigating the origins of Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia probe and a firm on whose board Joe Biden\u2019s son sat.\n\n\u201c[Pompeo] recognized Giuliani as doing something that was inconsistent with the State Department\u2019s policy,\u201d said one former State Department official. \u201cClearly, he was not in a position to stop it.\u201d\n\nBy July 18, Taylor learned that the White House had frozen security aid to Ukraine \u201cfor no reason I could discern.\u201d\n\nTaylor, as text messages previously released this month made clear, considered all that a disaster undermining the anti-corruption policy he thought he was enforcing. On advice from then-national security adviser John Bolton, Taylor said he wrote an Aug. 29 cable \u2014 a formal State Department document \u2014 to Pompeo \u201cdescribing the \u2018folly\u2019\u201d he \u201ccould not and would not defend.\u201d He told Congress he received \u201cno specific response.\u201d\n\nState Department spokespeople did not respond to questions about what happened to the Aug. 29 cable. Nor did they identify any disputes they had with Taylor\u2019s characterizations of events. Shortly after Taylor\u2019s deposition, a statement from White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham railed against \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats.\u201d The State Department did not issue any statement defending Taylor, something that stunned Countryman and other diplomatic veterans.\n\nCountryman said, \u201cI think that if Mr. Pompeo ever absorbed any of the leadership lessons I know West Point teaches\u201d\u2014Pompeo, like Taylor, is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy\u2014\u201che has long forgotten them.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the congressmen and women leading the impeachment probe wrote Pompeo deputy John Sullivan to reiterate their demand for \u201cspecific documents in the possession, custody or control\u201d of Foggy Bottom, including documents described to them by recent witnesses. The material sought includes \u201cdiplomatic cables,\u201d likely a reference to the Aug. 29 cable Taylor disclosed sending Pompeo, as well as texts, emails, and \u201cmemoranda that document efforts to press Ukraine to initiate politically-motivated investigations to benefit President Trump.\u201d\n\nSuch memoranda, the Democrats\u2019 letter claimed, \u201craise concerns about false representations by the Department to the Committees\u201d and \u201cdocument efforts to intimidate or silence employees.\u201d\n\nSome of those records may see the light of day due to a transparency lawsuit entirely separate from the congressional impeachment inquiry. A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the State Department to disclose within 30 days documents about the Ukraine effort, including those concerning Giuliani\u2019s involvement and Yovanovich\u2019s firing.\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Sam Brodey", "description": "Amb.
