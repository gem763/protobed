At the moment, I would like my focus to be on the show, and I\u2019m not interested in negative media attention.\u2019\n\nWhat has Lubna said about the row?\n\nLubna was fired in last week\u2019s show (Picture: BBC)\n\nLubna addressed the incident after getting her marching orders from the boardroom last week.\n\n\u2018All I can say is I wish her well, she has a lot to learn in terms of how to treat people,\u2019 the 33-year-old said of the comments. \u2018But she is quite young and I\u2019m sure that within this process she has learnt a lot and will take something from it.\u2019\n\nWhat has the BBC said?\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nA BBC spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: \u2018While this happened on a private messenger service once filming had concluded, the BBC nevertheless still expects the candidates to behave appropriately.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The production company have looked into the issue and reported back, Lottie has been informed that her comments were wholly unacceptable and is in no doubt about our view on this.\u2019\n\nHowever it\u2019s been reported that other candidates are set to raise fresh complaints to the BBC over the incident \u2013 while fellow candidate Souleyman Bah has also spoken out about what happened.\n\nSpeaking on podcast The Wake Up Call alongside 2018 winner Sian Gabbidon, Souleyman said: \u2018I think there were comments that, you know, yeah\u2026 I won\u2019t get into the details of it, but I think it was definitely what it was.\n\n\u2018I will counter that by saying it was ignorance, really. It\u2019s definitely ignorant racism. I think there\u2019s blatant racism and then there\u2019s ignorant racism.\u2019\n\nWhen is The Apprentice on?\n\nThe series continues on BBC One on Wednesday night at 9pm.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
