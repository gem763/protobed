The law and basic decency require no less,\" Dittes added.\n\nNearly 50,000 GM workers walked off the job in mid-September, launching the biggest labor dispute to hit the automaker in more than a decade.\n\nOn Friday, the company let it be known that it would extend health insurance coverage for its workers for the duration of the strike.\n\nThat was seen as a sign that the sides might reach an agreement as early as the weekend, despite obstacles over pay and job security for new hires.\n\nBut Dittes said that management's response to the Saturday proposals offered little change from those that the union had previously rejected.\n\nThe strike has shut down GM production in the United States, impacting its operations in Canada and Mexico where thousands of workers have been temporarily laid off.\n\nGM produces the Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC brands.\n\nBesides better pay and benefits, the union wants GM to reactivate four factories shut down in November 2018.\n\nFor its part, GM says it has proposed more than $7 billion in new investments in US facilities, 5,400 new jobs and higher salaries.\n\nExperts say the strike could cost the company as much as $100 million each day.", "description": "Negotiations to resolve a three-week-old strike at General Motors for better pay, benefits and job security have taken \"a turn for the worse,\" a top negotiator with the United Autoworkers Union said Sunday.  \"After making some progress on important issues a couple days ago, the company", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FAOcKmvjYqI7tSoDirkdqw--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/6162450899eb33b0b8eb1ff5e638e655eac8ae7c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
