Just as you would get three square meals with no snacking in between, there were also regulated TV times.\n\nWe would be allowed to watch one programme then it was turned off.\n\nMy friend\u2019s parents even kept their television covered with a cloth when it wasn\u2019t in use, like a shroud, only to be unveiled for important \u00adoccasions like Muhammad Ali fights and the Nine O\u2019Clock News.\n\nBack then it was unthinkable that you would just sit in a stupor staring at the telly from dusk till dawn.\n\nWhat would we have watched anyway? We only had three channels back then and BBC2 was too boring for words.\n\n(Image: Valentin Wolf/imageBROKER/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBut now this constant bombardment is causing an epidemic of short-sightedness and opticians are urging parents to take action before it is too late. There is predicted to be a surge in the numbers of people who will become blind or visually impaired in the future as a direct result of too much screen time.\n\nThe findings have been revealed by the International Myopia Institute, and there was also a study of the \u00adlifestyles of almost 9,000 youngsters by Dr Clare Quigley, an ophthalmologist based at Galway University Hospital, Ireland, who found that myopia \u2013 short-\u00adsightedness \u2013 was not genetic.\n\nInstead a direct link between myopia and sedentary lifestyles was found.\n\nShe said: \u201cTime outdoors, especially during your early \u00adchildhood, is protective against myopia.\u201d\n\nAt the moment around 20% of under-16s are short-sighted compared to just 7.2% back in the 1960s, and the situation is getting worse.\n\nBy 2050 myopia rates will go up to 50%. Apparently it is very rare in nomadic communities.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t just eyesight which is suffering. Youngsters are also racking up huge bills playing online games. We must open our eyes to this epidemic.\n\nWe need to put down the iPads and iPhones and consider our actual eyes.\n\nAfter all, we only get one pair.", "description": "Children who are inactive and don't go outdoors enough are more likely to suffer short-sightedness, studies are revealing", "authors": ["Anila Baig", "Image", "Getty", "Valentin Wolf Imagebroker Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20688809.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Boy-playing-video-games.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
