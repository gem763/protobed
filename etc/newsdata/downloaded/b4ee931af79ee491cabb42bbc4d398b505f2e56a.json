REUTERS/Ted Pritchard/File Photo\n\nSingh, 40, the first minority leader of a federal Canadian political party, is also running in his first national campaign as head of the New Democrat Party (NDP).\n\nWhen the photo of Trudeau in blackface emerged last week, Singh, a practicing Sikh who often pairs bright turbans with stylish suits, won widespread praise for focusing on the potential impact on people who have experienced racism, rather than on scoring points against Trudeau.\n\n\u201cThe kids that see this image, the people who see this image, are going to think about all the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt, that they were hit, that they were insulted, that they were made to feel less because of who they are,\u201d he said in a three-minute video posted to social media.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that you have value, you have worth, you are loved. And I don\u2019t want you to give up on Canada and please don\u2019t give up on yourselves.\u201d\n\nCanada is a multicultural country, and more than 22% of the population are members of visible minorities, while another 5% are aboriginal, according to the latest census.\n\n\u201cSingh was made for this issue,\u201d said Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker. \u201cThis is his time. There\u2019s nobody else who can speak to this issue better than he can.\u201d\n\nThough there is little chance the NDP could win the election, the reversal of Singh\u2019s fortunes could shape the outcome of the vote.\n\nIn Canada\u2019s parliamentary democracy, he could be a kingmaker if neither Trudeau\u2019s Liberals nor the Conservatives win a majority of seats in the House of Commons. Or he could draw votes away from Trudeau and hand victory to the Conservatives.\n\nSome 14% of Canadians said Singh would make the best prime minister, up four percentage points from last week, according to Ipsos, compared with 33% for Trudeau, who lost four points from last week.\n\nSingh\u2019s response resonated with Canadians of all backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an NDP voter but he just gained my respect and a bit of admiration,\u201d said @tarchon7, who described himself as \u201ca Canadian patriot, father and conservative\u201d on Twitter, while others filled social media with appreciation for his stance.\n\nVoting intentions among visible minorities spiked for the NDP after the blackface images emerged, reaching 20% compared with 12% a week earlier, pollster Angus Reid said.\n\n\u201cTrudeau\u2019s pain is Singh\u2019s gain,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, executive director of Angus Reid Institute, on Twitter.\n\nMOMENTUM FOR CONSERVATIVES\n\nOn Tuesday, the Conservative Party showed it had momentum by taking a lead in three national polls, but that\u2019s also because Singh and the Greens have taken a bite out of Liberal support.\n\n\u201cThe issue for the Liberal Party is not necessarily losing to the Conservatives; it\u2019s the fragmentation of the progressive vote,\u201d Bricker said.\n\nThe upshot could be a Conservative government or a Liberal minority one supported by either the NDP or Greens, Bricker said.\n\nSingh is getting extraordinary visibility now, with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp giving ample coverage to his campaign events, while just a month ago he seemed to be heading for disaster.\n\nSingh, who lives in the Toronto area, had a rocky time after winning NDP leadership in 2017. Not elected to parliament until earlier this year, he had repeated squabbles with his caucus.\n\nA third of the NDP lawmakers elected in 2015 - 15 in total - decided not to run again this year. One of them shifted to the Green party last month.\n\nMany of the top NDP staff has also fallen by the wayside, and on the day the official campaign kicked off on Sept. 11, the party still had 85 nominations to make in order to field a candidate in each of Canada\u2019s 338 ridings.\n\nSince then, Singh has stood out for his eloquence and pragmatism on the campaign trail.\n\nTrudeau, who has repeatedly begged for forgiveness from Canadians for the blackface episode, called the NDP leader to apologise privately on Tuesday. Neither side provided details.\n\nSingh had previously said he would only take the call if it were private.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be used as a tool to exonerate Mr. Trudeau. I don\u2019t want to be a part of a PR process to say he checked off these boxes and, look, he made this call, and he\u2019s all good,\u201d Singh told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a part of that.\u201d", "description": "Canada's Jagmeet Singh, facing a rout of his left-wing New Democrats in next month's election, may have revived his party's fortunes with his emotional response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's blackface picture.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433618494&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O07H", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
