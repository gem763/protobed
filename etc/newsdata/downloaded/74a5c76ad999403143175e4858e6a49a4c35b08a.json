Investigators have focused in particular on a legal set up that allows Boeing and other manufacturers to take on much of the work of certifying that aircraft are safe.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA second day of hearings before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has been investigating the crashes, is set for Wednesday.\n\nAccording to his prepared remarks, committee chairman Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) plans to say Boeing had information that some pilots would take far longer to respond to a new automated feature implicated in both crashes than the four seconds relied on by the company \u201cand that if that happened, the results would be catastrophic, resulting in the loss of the aircraft.\u201d\n\nThe evidence for the statement is not clear from the remarks released by DeFazio\u2019s staff Tuesday and his office declined to provide details.\n\nAD\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Boeing had misled his office after the crashes, blaming them on pilot error. In reality, Blumenthal said: \u201cThose pilots never had a chance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBlumenthal asked Muilenburg to commit to supporting efforts to change the safety certification system, but Muilenburg committed only to participating in its efforts. He denied it was the company\u2019s position to blame the pilots.\n\n\u201cWe are responsible for our airplanes,\u201d Muilenburg said.\n\nCommittee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) trained early criticism on both Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration. Wicker pointed to recently released correspondence between Boeing and the FAA, saying it reflected \u201ca disturbing level of casualness and flippancy\u201d that seemed to corroborate criticisms of an \u201cinappropriately close relationship\u201d between manufacturer and regulator.\n\nAD\n\nIn one of the emails, Boeing\u2019s former chief 737 technical pilot, Mark Forkner, said he would be \u00ad\u201cjedi-mind tricking regulators into accepting the training that I got accepted by FAA etc.,\u201d a reference to the company\u2019s successful campaign to minimize training for pilots who would be flying the Max.\n\nAD\n\nPressed by Wicker on when Muilenburg learned of that email, the CEO said he had been informed of the details \u201cjust recently,\u201d as they were being reported publicly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall being briefed on the documents any time prior to that,\u201d Muilenburg said. \u201cThe comments, the values, the approaches that are described in those emails, are counter to our values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMuilenburg said the company had made mistakes, and he expressed deep remorse. \u201cAs a husband and father, I am heartbroken by your losses,\u201d he told survivors of those killed in Indonesia and in Ethi\u00ado\u00adpia under similar circumstances within five months. The family members, sitting three rows back from Muilenburg, at one point held up photographs of their lost husbands, wives and children.\n\nShortly after the Lion Air flight took off, the captain and first officer began to struggle with the controls, as the new automated feature on the Max received erroneous sensor data and repeatedly forced the nose down. The crash killed 189 people.\n\nAD\n\nInformation about the feature \u2014 the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) \u2014 had been kept out of the Flight Crew Operating Manual on Boeing\u2019s assumption that it would only rarely kick in.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDelete MCAS,\u201d Forkner wrote to an FAA official in 2017 as the plane\u2019s five-year certification was nearing the finish line.\n\nThe deletion served Boeing\u2019s commercial interest at the time, which was to minimize the regulations it had to follow and the amount of costly training required of its customers.\n\nLess than five months after the Indonesian tragedy, an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed in similar circumstances, killing another 157 people.\n\nSoon after that crash regulators worldwide moved to ground the Max.\n\nThe crashes have been a major crisis for Boeing. The grounding of the Max, a more fuel efficient version of the popular 737, has hurt the company\u2019s finances and stock price and shaken public confidence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a former Army helicopter pilot, challenged Muilenburg\u2019s assertion that the development of MCAS followed industry standards. She said the feature was designed in such a way that it worked against pilots\u2019 training to pull back on their controls when the nose of their plane dips.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve not been telling the committee the whole truth,\u201d she said.\n\nMuilenburg pushed back against criticism from senators about the safety certification process used for planes in the United States, which includes a convoluted structure involving both manufacturers and the FAA known as Organization Designation Authorization (ODA).\n\nWhen asked by Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) whether the certification process should revert to the FAA, Muilenburg emphasized the need for collaboration.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are open to improving it. But the idea that we can tap the deep technical expertise of our companies across the aerospace industry is a valuable part of the certification process,\u201d Muilenburg said.\n\nAD\n\nTester said he remained unconvinced by the company\u2019s pledges.\n\n\u201cBoeing has had an incredibly valuable name, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, I would walk before I was to get on a 737 Max,\u201d Tester said. \u201cI would walk. There\u2019s no way. The question becomes when issues like this happen, it costs your company huge. And so you shouldn\u2019t be cutting corners, and I see corners being cut, and this committee has got to do something to stop that from happening. \u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) told Muilenburg his testimony was \u201c quite dismaying.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOver a tense, 56-second stretch, Cruz read, word for word, the heart of an instant message exchange between Forkner and another technical pilot that raised concerns \u2014 in 2016 \u2014 about the performance of MCAS.\n\nMuilenburg sat silent at the hearing table.\n\n\u201cMr. Forkner, \u2018So basically I lied to the regulators (unknowingly),\u2019 \u201d Cruz read.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGustavsson: \u2018It wasn\u2019t a lie, no one told us that was the case.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCruz continued, quoting Forkner saying MCAS was engaging \u201clike crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cForkner: \u2018Granted, I suck at flying, but even this was egregious.\u201d\n\nCruz stopped, then declared: \u201cThat exchange describes what happened in Lion Air and Ethiopian Air.\u201d\n\nHe tried to pin down Muilenburg on what he knew about the exchange and when. Earlier in the hearing, Muilenberg said he had been \u201cmade aware\u201d of the exchange before the Ethiopia crash but only \u201cbecame familiar with the details\u201d of it in the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cMr. Muilenburg, how in the hell did nobody bring this to your attention in February\u201d when Boeing provided it to the Justice Department. \u201cHow did you just read this a couple weeks ago?\u201d Cruz asked.\n\n\u201cI was made aware of the existence of this kind of document, this issue, as part of that discovery process in the investigation, early in the year, as you pointed out. At that point, I counted on my counsel to handle that appropriately,\u201d Muilenburg said.\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, the chairmen of the House and Senate committees holding this week\u2019s hearings both said they expect Congress to consider changing aviation safety laws. But exactly what such a change might look like remains unclear.\n\nIn the months since the Ethiopian crash, Boeing has been working on fixes to the automated feature, stopping it from turning on several times in a row and requiring it to read data from two sensors as a fail safe. The FAA has been reviewing that work as it determines when to allow the plane to fly again.\n\nAt the same time, investigators for the Justice Department, international aviation regulators and lawyers for the victims\u2019 families have been examining how Boeing designed the Max and the FAA\u2019s role in approving it as safe.\n\nInvestigations have found that the FAA received fragmented information about the automated feature, which meant it did not get close enough scrutiny.\n\nAfter Muilenburg testified, the family members who attended said they were dissatisfied by his apology and what they saw as his failure to answer some of the Senators\u2019 questions.\n\nPawel Konarski, whose wife and young son died on the Ethiopian Airlines flight, said the hearing left him angry. He said the second crash was preventable and had no idea of the danger his wife and son were in when they got on the plane.", "description": "Dennis Muilenburg said the company had made mistakes, and he expressed deep remorse.
