He probably did it in less than a minute,\u201d Hopkins said Monday.\n\nThe gallery has a video camera, but it wasn\u2019t on at the time, Hopkins said.\n\nHowever, surveillance video from another business showed the man strolling down Geary Street with the artwork in his hand, KGO-TV reported .\n\nThe etching normally was secured with a tether, but it wasn\u2019t at the time of the theft, Hopkins said.\n\nKGO-TV said the etching would have been secured with a lock and cable that are missing and may have been cut off by the crook. But Hopkins said he doubted that. He suggested the tether might have been removed a day earlier for a showing and not replaced.\n\nAlthough art thieves sometimes have clients who pay for certain pieces, \u201cI think it was a theft of opportunity,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nThe etching was insured, he said. It was one of about 30 pieces on display for the gallery\u2019s ongoing Dali exhibition.\n\nHopkins said the etching is relatively rare. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s one of the most desirable pieces out of that period,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is very well-known and is also numbered, Hopkins said.\n\nThat made it unlikely to be sold online, another director, Angela Kellett, told KGO-TV.\n\nAnyone with information on the theft can contact police.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A brazen thief stole a Salvador Dali etching valued at $20,000 from a San Francisco gallery, then walked off down the street with the work in his hand.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
