He hasn\u2019t stopped coming back since 1984.\n\nBut apart from a brief appearance in flashback, it takes more than an hour of Terminator: Dark Fate for the former governor of California, all six syllables and 17 stone of him, to muscle in on the action.\n\nCoincidentally, it\u2019s hardly more than a month since Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s old mucker Sylvester Stallone ran amok one last time as John Rambo.\n\nApart from a brief appearance in flashback, it takes more than an hour of Terminator: Dark Fate for the former governor of California, all six syllables and 17 stone of him, to muscle in on the action\n\nWhat is it with these old action heroes, still punching other people\u2019s lights out when they should be focused more on turning their own lights out after an afternoon of gentle gardening and an easily-digestible supper?\n\nStill, at least Sly can still act. Arnie has more or less given up. It helps, of course, that he\u2019s playing a world-weary cyborg assassin, which doesn\u2019t call for much in the way of facial gestures or verbal animation.\n\nBut then you could tease a similar performance from a wardrobe. Arnie apart, director Tim Miller\u2019s movie taps as subtly as a freshly-charged power drill into the MeToo sensibilities of post-Weinstein Hollywood.\n\nLinda Hamilton is back for the first time since 1991\u2019s Terminator 2: Judgment Day (to which this film is notionally a direct sequel), again playing Sarah Connor, whose son John was once the repository for all humankind\u2019s hopes, and who knows a thing or two about cyborg killers\n\nA trio of leading ladies is led by Natalia Reyes as Dani, a young Mexican woman who is having a pretty average day until a deadly new-model Terminator (Gabriel Luna) shows up at her Mexico City apartment block, murders her father and steals his identity, then kills her brother, and relentlessly hunts her down on the understanding, which Dani herself is not unreasonably slow to grasp, that she alone holds the key to the survival of the entire human race.\n\nFans will probably enjoy this new outing more than they did 2015\u2019s strained Terminator Genisys, which lost far more old admirers of this once-mighty franchise than it attracted new ones\n\nHelping her to shoulder this onerous responsibility, and to stay alive so that humanity might struggle on, is a cybernetically enhanced super-soldier from the future called Grace (Mac-kenzie Davis).\n\nAnd Linda Hamilton is back for the first time since 1991\u2019s Terminator 2: Judgment Day (to which this film is notionally a direct sequel), again playing Sarah Connor, whose son John was once the repository for all humankind\u2019s hopes, and who knows a thing or two about cyborg killers. She\u2019s firmly in Dani\u2019s camp, too.\n\nBut this killer has fiendish capabilities the old ones didn\u2019t, thanks less to the sci-fi vision of the film\u2019s producer and story creator James Cameron, and more to advances in computer-generated imagery.\n\nThere is, though, such a thing as CGI fatigue, and it sets in pretty quickly here.\n\nBy the time you\u2019ve seen this deluxe version of a Terminator regenerate for the umpteenth time after being shot, crushed, run over or blown up, you begin to wish someone might step out of your own future, lead you away from the pyrotechnics and sit you down somewhere calm, with a mug of tea and a flapjack.\n\nAll that said, fans will probably enjoy this new outing more than they did 2015\u2019s strained Terminator Genisys, which lost far more old admirers of this once-mighty franchise than it attracted new ones.\n\nIt\u2019s good to see Hamilton again, and Davis is terrific, not just at the physical stuff but also delivering even her worst lines with real brio.\n\n\u2018You put 100 cops between you and a Terminator . . . you\u2019ll get 100 dead cops,\u2019 she says with a straight face.\n\nSpeaking of straight faces, Arnie might have the acting qualities of a large item of bedroom furniture, but if you\u2019re being generous you could call his style deadpan, and it helps him to deliver the few decent gags in the script with something very nearly identifiable as comic timing.\n\nAt the screening I went to, he was responsible for all three audible laughs. They were neck-and-neck with the yawns.\n\nBlack And Blue has the veneer of a respectable thriller, with almost none of the substance.\n\nIt feels as if director Deon Taylor is trying to hoodwink audiences into thinking he\u2019s delivered a good movie by making it gritty and urban, with a subtext of racism, social deprivation and police venality in the story of a black rookie cop (Naomie Harris) trying to expose endemic corruption in the New Orleans force.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s all built on sand. As a cop-corruption thriller Black And Blue is less Witness, more witless; less Serpico, more Tesco . . . pile those clich\u00e9s high, and sell \u2019em cheap.\n\nHarris plays Alicia, who, after serving with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, returns to her home town and joins the police.\n\nShe has been on the job for just three weeks, long-estranged from all her old friends and relatives in a crime-ridden ghetto, when she stumbles upon an execution. She sees an undercover narcotics squad detective shooting a black drug dealer, with whom he was in cahoots, in cold blood.\n\nAlicia has footage of the slaying on the standard-issue camera attached to her uniform, so the rest of the movie is all about her trying to get safely back to police HQ, where she can upload the \u2018body-cam\u2019 footage and nail her crooked colleagues.\n\nAs a cop-corruption thriller Black And Blue is less Witness, more witless; less Serpico, more Tesco . . . pile those clich\u00e9s high, and sell \u2019em cheap\n\nIn the meantime they\u2019re trying to silence her, and to make matters even more perilous, they spread word she\u2019s the killer.\n\nSo now the local crimelord, whose nephew was the slain dealer, is after her, too.\n\nIf you think that sounds like the framework of a strong story, you\u2019d be right. And Harris is very good.\n\nBut the narrative is undermined again and again by lazy writing, uninspired direction or both.\n\nDespite being grievously wounded, Alicia keeps managing to outrun the bent cops rather as in one of those Seventies episodes of Cannon, in which our portly hero always caught up with the baddies, no matter how much younger and fitter they were.\n\nSimilar implausibilities abound throughout, none greater than when Alicia\u2019s only ally (Tyrese Gibson), knowing nothing about computers, learns in about 15 fraught seconds how to be a slick software programmer.\n\nFittingly, his name is Mouse. It\u2019s the movie\u2019s best joke, all the funnier for being entirely unintentional.\n\nIt\u2019s mysterious and spooky but the plot\u2019s a little kooky\n\nThe Addams Family (PG)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: Pretty deadly\n\nCharles Addams, who dreamt up the ghoulish family which bore his name for a series of New Yorker cartoons, also made animated training films for the U.S. Army during World War II.\n\nI hope they were more inspired than this feature-length animation, which rather wastes a great voice cast (led by Charlize Theron and Oscar Isaac, with Allison Janney and Bette Midler).\n\nIt\u2019s not poor, exactly, and the artwork is jolly good, but the narrative is often incoherent and any youngsters coming fresh to the characters will be, if not mortified, mystified.\n\nThe Addamses, hounded from a succession of homes by hostile villagers, eventually settle \u2018somewhere no-one in their right minds would be caught dead in\u2019 \u2014 cut to a \u2018New Jersey\u2019 state sign\n\nI\u2019ve been fond of Morticia and Gomez Addams (voiced here by Theron and Isaac) and their family of weirdos ever since living decades ago in the U.S., where the 1960s sitcom was a constant on TV.\n\nMoreover, the co-director is Conrad Vernon, whose credits include the wildly entertaining Sausage Party (2016) as well as Shrek 2. So I expected great things.\n\nUnfortunately, they never quite arrive. The story is suitably silly, though.\n\nThe Addamses, hounded from a succession of homes by hostile villagers, eventually settle \u2018somewhere no-one in their right minds would be caught dead in\u2019 \u2014 cut to a \u2018New Jersey\u2019 state sign. So much for The Boss doing all he can to big up the Garden State (see review below).\n\nAnyway, the family set down roots, then find (when a persistent fog clears) that they are just up the hill from a shiny new town called Assimilation, brainchild of a conniving TV reality show presenter called Margaux Needler (Janney).\n\nA feud unfolds, which at times is amusing but too much of the humour dies a death.\n\nA missed opportunity. An own ghoul, even.\n\nThe Boss in his barn is a tour de force\n\nWestern Stars (PG)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: A musical treat\n\nWestern Stars is Bruce Springsteen\u2019s 19th album, but didn\u2019t lend itself to a tour because of all the orchestral backing to the tracks; so instead, \u2018the Boss\u2019 decided to make a film, in which he could introduce all these new songs much as he might on stage.\n\nThe result is truly cherishable, especially if you\u2019re a fan, but maybe even if you\u2019re not \u2014 because it\u2019s hard not to be beguiled by Bruce\u2019s charisma, his heartfelt, melancholic meditations on life, and of course his sound.\n\nSpringsteen is not just the essence of rugged old wrangler chic \u2014 cooler than the Marlboro Man \u2014 but one of the great American storytellers\n\nNot that it\u2019s his usual sound. The inspiration behind this album was rooted in the kind of songs Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb wrote, for the likes of Glen Campbell.\n\nAnd hearing Springsteen performing them, in the cavernous 19th-century barn on his estate in New Jersey, with his wife Patti at the microphone alongside him, feels like as big a treat for us as it clearly was for his small audience of selected friends.\n\nSpringsteen is not just the essence of rugged old wrangler chic \u2014 cooler than the Marlboro Man \u2014 but one of the great American storytellers.\n\nThis lovely film, which at just 83 minutes never outstays its welcome, does him full justice.\n\nThe Beach Bum (18)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: Bum is the word\n\nThe title character in this self-indulgent comedy is a drug-addled poet called Moondog, boozed-up, washed-up, and played with 20 per cent too much relish by Matthew McConaughey in a long peroxide wig\n\nThe title character in this self-indulgent comedy is a drug-addled poet called Moondog, boozed-up, washed-up, and played with 20 per cent too much relish by Matthew McConaughey in a long peroxide wig. Or maybe he\u2019s so committed to his art that it\u2019s his real hair.\n\nPractically everyone in the movie thinks Moondog is just great, especially Moondog himself, but actually he\u2019s the kind of feckless, self-centred (and probably rather smelly) boor most right-thinking folk would cross the street, if not the county, to avoid.\n\nUnfortunately, writer-director Harmony Korine (Kids, Spring Breakers) doesn\u2019t see this any more than McConaughey does, so what unfolds is an incredibly tiresome chronicle of Moondog\u2019s dissolute, promiscuous lifestyle, which he is able to afford only because his wife Minnie (Isla Fisher) is richer than Croesus.\n\nShe reckons he\u2019s great too, by the way, even though he\u2019s too busy getting blissed out in Key West to return much to their Miami home, and, on the eve of her wedding day, has forgotten how old their daughter is. He thinks she\u2019s 16. She\u2019s 22.\n\nWhen Moondog does go home, he pleasures Minnie sexually while she\u2019s having a pedicure - yup, that\u2019s how hedonistic they are.\n\nNever mind Croesus, it\u2019s the lunatic, bacchanalian excess of Caligula\u2019s court and we\u2019re clearly meant to be amused or perhaps even charmed by it.\n\nBut this is one of those movies in which the actors seem to be having a much better time than the audience, and actually that\u2019s no fun at all.\n\nThe story gets no more interesting even in the wake of tragedy, when Moondog\u2019s money tap is finally turned off with the promise that it will be turned back on if he finally produces the novel he\u2019s supposedly been working on.\n\nZac Efron, Jonah Hill and Snoop Dogg are among those lending uneven support. They really shouldn\u2019t have bothered.", "description": "BRIAN VINER: Fans will probably enjoy this new outing more than they did 2015's strained Terminator Genisys, which lost far more old admirers of this once-mighty franchise than it attracted new ones.", "authors": ["Brian Viner For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/22/20150880-0-image-a-14_1571952207569.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
