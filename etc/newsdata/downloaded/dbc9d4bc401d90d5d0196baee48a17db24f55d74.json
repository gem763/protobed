Some of them were really on to it. Coming to the end of series five, some of them were clued up but the majority of people didn\u2019t predict the ending.\n\n\u2018The amount of theories were brilliant. People were [thinking], \u201cIt\u2019s an object because it\u2019s got H on top of the building\u201d. It was just one extreme to the other, it was great.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really proud of the show, that it can have that kind of effect and give people a bit of entertainment, along with being able to create their own theories and things aren\u2019t spoon fed to them.\n\nVicky McClure loved seeing fans\u2019 \u2018extreme\u2019 theories (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why Jed is a clever, clever man.\u2019\n\nThe 36-year-old also revealed that people behind the scenes got in on the action, and began suspecting everyone.\n\nShe joked: \u2018Everybody suspected everybody! Even some of the SAs that are in the show, and have been in the show for quite a few years, are going: \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s her or him\u201d.\n\n\u2018I was just rolling with it.\u2019\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Kate isn\u2019t H\u2026\n\nSeries six could be with us next year (Picture: BBC)\n\nVicky insisted she has no clue about the upcoming series, but teased that she\u2019s \u2018very excited\u2019 for what is coming up.\n\n\u2018I have no information. I\u2019m not doing that to be difficult, I don\u2019t know a thing,\u2019 she continued. \u2018So I\u2019m currently just waiting in the wings, we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\n\u2018Jed\u2019s scripts are watertight and extremely strong. He\u2019s a perfectionist, he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. And I\u2019m very excited.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know anything, though. I genuinely don\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t have a clue.\u2019\n\nVicky recently took part in a photoshoot with noted photographer, Rankin, for his Loyalty & Love collaboration, with Marriott hotels.\n\nJonny Owen and Vicky McClure took part in Rankin\u2019s Loyalty & Love shoot (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe BBC star star was joined in front of the camera by fianc\u00e9 Jonny Owen, whom she starred with in This Is England and Svengali.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about why they decided to take part, she explained: \u2018Me and Johnny don\u2019t really do photoshoots together for any reason in particular, we\u2019ve only done one before. This just made sense.\n\n\u2018There was a reason for it, because we\u2019re away for work quite a lot. It\u2019s something we know a lot about, we spend a lot of time in hotels and away from home.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just something positive, there\u2019s nothing negative about it, it\u2019s about love and loyalty and travel and things that mean a lot to us and actually help us to enjoy the times when we\u2019re away from each other or away from home. So that\u2019s why we did it.\u2019\n\nJonny also revealed the photographer made them feel \u2018so comfortable\u2019 on set \u2013 but there was one thing that shocked him about the final photos, which they both saw blown up at the launch party at the beginning of the month.\n\n\u2018When they blow pictures up of your head, you can\u2019t believe how big your ear is,\u2019 he added. \u2018They\u2019re very unforgiving when they\u2019re that size.\u2019\n\nGood to know\u2026\n\nVicky McClure & Jonny Owen captured by Rankin for Loyalty & Love, a collaboration with Marriott Bonvoy, the travel programme from Marriott International.
