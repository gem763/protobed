They are known for using high levels of mercury that pollute local water sources.\n\nTribe members told Reuters that the Munduruku are sometimes called upon to do heavy labour for the miners, known as garimpeiros, in exchange for food, a small amount of gold or small sums of money. They also fear they may already be the targets of hired hit men.\n\nIndians across Brazil say non-indigenous presence in their territories threatens their safety and unique culture, both of which are protected by the constitution.", "description": "Deep in Brazil\u2019s Amazon rainforest, the Munduruku tribe has been searching out and expelling illegal \u201cwildcat\u201d miners encroaching on their territory.", "authors": ["Lunae Parracho"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQzFQhlp2eHaCvbaBbzk_b9mCdri2H62tbwJN38oZfzsqr7EH_eJXG_vMco-veYZE-9xdEo95gUIOE-1AniyZch2ApKcHhntb7wtxdJ58Xsd-"}
