When he saw Vivian's letter, he decided to make it happen.\n\n\"It was an easy response for me because I agreed with her,\" he said, noting his only hesitation for creating female versions had been the expensive and lengthy production that would be required, including creating a new mold.\n\n\"I\u2019ve since heard from a lot of women have told me they wanted to have this toy when they were growing up,\" Imel said. \"People have been very supportive, enough to make me know that this is a product that people want.\"\n\nImel plans to have the Green Army Women figurines available by Christmas 2020. They will come in four different military poses.\n\nVivian, of course, will be one of the first buyers.\n\n\"[I'm most excited] to set them up and play with them,\" she told \"GMA.\" \"It makes me so happy and proud.\"\n\nLord described her daughter as \"wise beyond her years.\" She hopes kids are inspired by Vivan to speak up and that adults are inspired to listen.\n\n\"I think this is a great example of listening to kids because they see things that we don\u2019t see,\" she said. \"Things have always been that way and we just go with it and children with fresh eyes can see things the way they\u2019re supposed to be.\"", "description": "BMC Toys debuted a prototype figurine at the Chicago Toy Soldier Show.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/vivan-01-as-ht-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
