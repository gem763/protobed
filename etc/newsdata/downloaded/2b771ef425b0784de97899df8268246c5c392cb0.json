I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right but we will go ahead and of course parliament will come back.\u201d\n\nMPs to return immediately in wake of supreme court ruling Read more\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is perfectly usual to have a Queen\u2019s speech. That is what we want to do, but more importantly let\u2019s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit. There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street source said Johnson had no intention of resigning in the wake of the judgment. However, he will fly home from the UN general assembly early after a conference call with cabinet ministers due at 6pm BST.\n\nThe PM had been due to leave New York on Wednesday morning, meaning he would be travelling when parliament returned. However, he will now leave directly after his speech to the main general assembly hall on Tuesday evening.\n\nBefore the speech, Johnson was due to meet a series of leaders including Donald Trump, Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar and Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani.\n\nSpeaking to business leaders at the plush new Hudson Yards development in New York, Johnson broke off from his pre-trailed speech about investing in post-Brexit Britain to reiterate his words about the judgment, saying it would be \u201cremiss and wrong\u201d not to address it.\n\n\u201cI have the highest respect, of course, for the judiciary and the independence of our courts,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cBut I must say I strongly disagree with the judgment, and we in the UK will not be deterred from getting on and delivering on the will of the people to come out of the EU on 31 October, because that is what we were mandated to do.\u201d\n\nUK supreme court ruling: the key issues behind judges' decision Read more\n\nThere was a major policy agenda planned, he said. \u201cAnd to do that we will need a Queen\u2019s speech to decide how we are going to do that.\n\n\u201cI think that is what the people of my country, the UK, want to see. They want to see us getting on with a strong domestic agenda, and they want to see Brexit delivered by 31 October.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear how Johnson and his team plan to respect the ruling while also allowing for an imminent Queen\u2019s speech, and it seems likely Downing Street is still deciding how to respond in the coming days.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before the speech, Johnson disagreed with the notion that the supreme court judgment found the prorogation to be unlawful and democratic. \u201cI\u2019m not certain that the justices did say that. I think that they certainly thought that the prorogation we chose was not something they could approve of.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual judgment to come to. The prerogative of prorogation is a very old one and it\u2019s not, I think, been contested before in this way.\u201d", "description": "PM says he will respect ruling but insists new legislative programme still needed", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff7d6e5168a89287906f5453dcd8cb211f9cb2ac/1275_196_2196_1317/master/2196.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=429a9a6088893aca5787edc0527b66dc", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
