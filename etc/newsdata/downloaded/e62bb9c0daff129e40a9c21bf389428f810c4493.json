Output shrank in the second quarter when businesses found themselves holding unnecessary stock that had built up before the original leaving date.\n\nThe Deloitte report said the resulting uncertainty was now entrenched while domestic economic factors such as weak productivity and competitiveness are a growing concern.\n\nWith weak demand in Britain becoming the second biggest risk facing companies, expectations of an interest rate cut are also growing.\n\n\"With Brexit cited as the biggest risk businesses face, the last quarter has also seen heightened concern over slowing growth in the UK and Eurozone and CFOs are tightening their purse strings in response,\" Stewart said.\n\nThe fate of Britain's departure from the European Union will become clearer in the next three weeks, ahead of the new Brexit deadline on Oct. 31.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit by that date, meaning the world's fifth largest economy will either leave with a transition deal, ask for a further delay, or leave without a deal, a move that will likely spark huge economic disruption.\n\nDeloitte said 91 CFOs contributed to the survey, drawn from or 250 companies, or from the biggest unlisted companies in the UK. The combined market value of the 70 UK\u2011listed companies surveyed is 468 billion pounds, or approximately 19% of the UK quoted equity market, Deloitte said.", "description": "UK firms to cut costs and hiring in next 12 months - survey", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9C0RB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
